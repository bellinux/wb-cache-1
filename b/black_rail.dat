5|$|Puerto Rico's {{avifauna}} {{has diminished}} due to extinction and extirpation, either by natural forces or human intervention. For example, fossil evidence was discovered for {{a species of}} swift, Tachornis uranoceles, dated to the late Pleistocene (between 17,000 and 21,000 years ago). The species {{is believed to have}} become extinct as a result of habitat alteration after the Wisconsin glaciation. At least six endemic species have become extinct in the last millennia: Puerto Rican barn owl (Tyto cavatica), Puerto Rican caracara (Polyborus latebrosus), Puerto Rican conure (Aratinga chloroptera maugei), Puerto Rican woodcock (Scolopax anthonyi), Puerto Rican quail-dove (Geotrygon larva), and the Antillean cave rail (Nesotrochis debooyi). With a population of 13 individuals in 1975, the Puerto Rican parrot almost became the seventh, but conservation efforts helped save the species from extinction. However, it {{is still one of the}} ten most critically endangered birds in the world. Four Puerto Rican birds, the Hispaniolan parakeet, the white-necked crow, the Cuban crow, and the limpkin, became extirpated after Puerto Rico's population expansion in the latter half of the nineteenth century and three more species, the black-bellied whistling duck, the <b>black</b> <b>rail,</b> and the American flamingo, no longer breed in the archipelago.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variety of}} salamanders, snakes and frogs are also present. The federally listed as {{threatened}} California red-legged frog {{is present in}} the northern reach draining the south slopes of Annadel State Park.

50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>rails</b> {{appear to}} be omnivorous, feeding {{primarily}} on small invertebrates but also on seeds of some marsh plants.|$|R
50|$|They are preyed upon by many avian (including hawks, egrets, and herons) and {{mammalian}} (including foxes and cats) {{predators and}} rely {{on the cover of}} thick marsh vegetation for protection. High tides are dangerous time for <b>black</b> <b>rails</b> as they are quite vulnerable to predation outside the marsh.|$|R
50|$|Benicia SRA {{has been}} {{designated}} an Important Bird Area, providing habitat for endangered California clapper rails (Rallus longirostris obsoletus) and <b>black</b> <b>rails</b> (Laterallus jamaicensis).

50|$|In the 1870s, the International Railway Bridge {{connected}} {{the two nations}} at Black Rock, an engineering marvel at the time. The <b>Black</b> Rock <b>Rail</b> Yard handled both passenger service and commercial transport of goods {{into and out of}} Canada. Following the completion of the St. Lawrence Seaway, the construction of the United States's Interstate Highway system, Canada's Queen Elizabeth Highway, and the increase of commercial air travel, the <b>Black</b> Rock <b>Rail</b> Yard lost its passenger service and later most of its commercial freight service. The railroad bridge, however, remains in heavy usage {{and is one of the}} most important rail crossings between the United States and Canada.|$|R

50|$|The bridge {{consists}} of two sections, the first extending from the Canadian shore to Unity Island (formerly known as Squaw Island,) and the second extending from Unity Island to the American mainland shore.
