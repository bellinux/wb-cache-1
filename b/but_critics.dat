5|$|Mrs. Tiggy-winkle {{has been}} {{described}} as one of Potter's most positive creations, <b>but</b> <b>critics</b> consider Lucie an artistic failure. Although Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is set in an identifiable place and time period, the tale is mythologized by reaching back to an age when household chores were performed manually and without the aid of modern mechanical inventions. The simple dwellings, rustic pathways, and stone fences enhance the tale's timeless aspect and suggest an unchanging countryside and its way of life.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, the same {{philosophers}} also claimed that common-sense mental states {{simply do not}} exist. <b>But</b> <b>critics</b> pointed out that eliminativists could not have it both ways: either mental states exist and will ultimately be {{explained in terms of}} lower-level neurophysiological processes or they do not. Modern eliminativists have much more clearly expressed the view that mental phenomena simply do not exist and will eventually be eliminated from people's thinking about the brain {{in the same way that}} demons have been eliminated from people's thinking about mental illness and psychopathology.|$|E

6000|$|... "The true artist," [...] {{said the}} picture, [...] "is always an ignorant man. An artist who theorises {{about his work}} is no longer artist <b>but</b> <b>critic.</b> Wagner ... I say!--What's that red paint for?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Jason Buchanan at AllMovie {{says that}} {{director}} Hideo Gosha makes a [...] "triumphant {{return to the}} samurai genre with this plot twisting, nerve shredding tale", <b>but</b> <b>critic</b> Alexander Jacoby calls it [...] "a bland chanbara".|$|R
5|$|Haunting Ground {{was first}} {{revealed}} in September 2004, {{and was released}} next April garnering mixed to average reviews. The graphics and presentation were praised, <b>but</b> <b>critics</b> found the gameplay somewhat repetitive, predictable, and derivative of previous horror titles. The sexual objectification of Fiona was highlighted by some critics {{as one of the}} game's best elements. They found that by illustrating her as an object of desire, the game makes Fiona and therefore the player feel more fragile and endangered, building a more disturbing atmosphere. The fluctuating degree of player control over Fiona has made Haunting Ground a key subject in the study of avatars and their relationship with players in video games.|$|E
5|$|In January 2000, Baird {{unveiled}} {{a series of}} initiatives designed to reduce fraud and misuse in the welfare system. This was highlighted by {{the establishment of a}} welfare fraud hotline and a complementary conditionality three months later, in which anyone convicted of welfare fraud would run the risk of being given a lifetime ban from the program. The investigations Baird initiated during the fiscal year of 2000 uncovered $58.2 million in social assistance that people were not entitled to receive, and $16.6 million in avoided future costs, <b>but</b> <b>critics</b> of this approach, including opposition members, poverty advocates, and scholars, suggested that the Harris government was overstating the extent of fraud in order to undermine public confidence in welfare programs. In mid-year, Baird announced that workfare placements had reached departmental quotas for most of the province.|$|E
5|$|In the June 2009 {{legislative}} elections, Kirchner {{was defeated}} by Francisco de Narváez of the Union PRO coalition for National Deputy of Buenos Aires Province. The Front for Victory was defeated in the Buenos Aires, Santa Fe and Córdoba, and the Kirchners lost the Congressional majority. Voter disenchantment with the Kirchners was caused by inflation, crime and the previous year's agricultural conflict, which cost them rural support. The Kirchners pushed a media law through during the Congress' lame-duck session. The Kirchners described it as an antitrust law to limit media ownership, <b>but</b> <b>critics</b> considered instead that {{it was used to}} reduce the freedom of the press.|$|E

5000|$|Critical {{reception}} was mixed. Life reviewer Richard Schickel praised Torn's performance, Ginsberg's inventive use {{of camera}} and sound, and the [...] "illuminating" [...] {{portrayal of a}} schizophrenic breakdown. [...] <b>But</b> <b>critic</b> Andrew Sarris gave it a less-favorable review, and the film was a commercial failure.|$|R
5000|$|His {{experimental}} [...] "novel" [...] Tristano, {{is conceived}} {{to be read}} by each reader differently, since each sentence is randomly shuffled.

5|$|The holonovel was {{intended}} as a vehicle to further explore Janeway's imagination and her social relationships, <b>but</b> <b>critics</b> disagreed on whether the storyline was appropriate for the character. The plotlines introduced in Janeway Lambda one were never fully resolved due to lack of interest from fans of the Voyager series and an attempt to target a male audience; Taylor had written a conclusion for the holonovel, but it was never developed into an episode. Janeway Lambda one was received negatively by television critics who believed it was poorly developed and too isolated from the main storylines of the Voyager series. The show's frequent use and expansion of the holodeck technology was also panned by reviewers.|$|E
5|$|When first {{exhibited}} in 1832, The Destroying Angel was widely praised for its technical brilliance, <b>but</b> <b>critics</b> were {{divided on the}} subject matter. Some praised its vividness and ability to mix fear and beauty without lowering into tastelessness; others criticised its thematic matter as inappropriate, and chastised Etty for wasting his talents. The painting changed {{the manner in which}} art critics viewed the artist; some saw it as indicating previously unseen character depths, others considered it a renunciation of his previous works. In 1854 Henry Payne, who had commissioned the painting, sold it to Sir Joseph Whitworth. Whitworth donated it in 1882 to the Manchester Art Gallery, where it remains.|$|E
5|$|During 1925, Kilner {{was awarded}} a benefit match and had an {{improved}} batting record for the season <b>but</b> <b>critics</b> began to notice a decline in his bowling. He was effective on pitches which favoured spin bowlers, {{but not on the}} flatter pitches prevalent in the dry summer of 1925. Cricket journals, such as The Cricketer, criticised his tendency to bowl leg theory—a tactic regarded as negative and overly defensive—when confronted with batting-friendly conditions. He took 131 wickets at 17.92, finishing second in the Yorkshire averages and helping his team to their fourth successive County Championship. He scored 1,068 runs at an average of 30.51 with two centuries. This gave him the third double of his career. Kilner's popularity with the crowds peaked in 1925, when over three days, 71,000 people attended his benefit match against Middlesex. It raised £4,106 (the equivalent of around £175,000 in 2008), to set a new record for benefit proceeds. There were no Test matches in 1925, but Kilner was once again selected for the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's, scoring 59 in his only innings and taking five wickets in the match, as well as some end of season matches for the MCC's team from the previous winter.|$|E

25|$|VAN has {{disputed the}} 'pessimistic' {{conclusions}} of their <b>critics,</b> <b>but</b> the <b>critics</b> have not relented.

5|$|During the 1953 season, Australia toured England having {{held the}} Ashes since 1934 <b>but</b> <b>critics</b> {{considered}} England {{to have a}} good chance of winning the series. Hutton was retained as England captain initially on a match-by-match basis. His health was uncertain and he was troubled by fibrositis which restricted his movement and adversely affected his fielding. He top-scored in both England innings with 43 and 60 not out in the drawn first Test, and batted effectively for Yorkshire against the Australians. After dropping three catches in Australia's first innings in the second Test, Hutton scored 145 runs in his first innings. However, he was dismissed early in the second innings; England managed to draw the match, but Hutton faced press criticism for his cautious tactics. Rain prevented a result in the third Test, but Hutton scored 66 and his tactics were praised. After the match, he was confirmed as captain for the remainder of the series, and the forthcoming MCC winter tour of West Indies.|$|E
5|$|Khánh {{had long}} been {{regarded}} as an ambitious and unscrupulous officer. Following the partition of Vietnam, Khánh, a French-trained officer {{who served in the}} French-backed Vietnamese National Army during the First Indochina War, had rallied to support Ngô Đình Diệm, who became the first president of the anti-communist South Vietnam (Republic of Vietnam). He rose to become the deputy chief of staff in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), but his record of political loyalty was called into question. In 1960, during an attempted coup by rebel paratroopers, Khánh jumped over the walls of the Independence Palace and joined Diệm during the siege, trying to negotiate an end to the stand-off with the rebels. Khánh parleyed with the rebels long enough for loyal forces to arrive from the outside the capital to suppress the uprising, but his critics contended that he was waiting to see which side would gain the upper hand and was not committed to Diệm. In any case, Diệm then promoted him to be the commander of II Corps. In his younger days, Khánh had joined the Viet Minh but then defected to the French colonial army after a year. Khánh claimed that he had left the Viet Minh because of its communist inclinations, <b>but</b> <b>critics</b> claimed that he was simply switching sides because the French-backed State of Vietnam offered him more opportunities for advancement.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{tried to}} enforce a controversial media law that would see Clarín lose licenses and be forced to sell most of its assets. The law was initially sanctioned as a competition law for the media, <b>but</b> <b>critics</b> pointed {{out that it is}} only being used to further the campaign against Clarín. The government had little interest in enforcing measures of the law that were not related to Clarín. Clarín launched a constitutional challenge against some articles of the law with the judiciary. The government released an anti-Clarín advertisement claiming it refused to obey the law and may be subverting democracy. The conflict led to disputes with the judiciary. Minister Julio Alak said that extending an injunction that allowed Clarín to keep its assets during the trial would be an insurrection, and it was rumored that judges who did not rule as the government wished might face impeachment. The court extended the inunction.|$|E

5000|$|... "Nothing Was Delivered" [...] has {{country music}} elements, as do other Basement Tapes songs. [...] Several authors, {{including}} Rolling Stone Magazine writer Greil Marcus, {{have suggested that}} the song is based on Fats Domino's 1940 standard [...] "Blueberry Hill." [...] <b>But</b> <b>critic</b> Clinton Heylin has suggested that the melody may have been conceived spontaneously by Dylan or else based on a country music riff he may have heard sometime earlier.|$|R

On her return from Cuba in 1855, when she played Lucrezia Borgia in the opera, the New York Times called her [...] "one of the few worth {{welcoming}} back again"; <b>but</b> <b>critic</b> Richard Grant White wrote that her voice had deteriorated into [...] "a bewildered shriek".|$|R
5|$|On {{the morning}} of the second Test, D'Oliveira was told by Colin Cowdrey, the England captain, that he had been left out of the team and was instead twelfth man. In his place, England chose a fast bowler to {{strengthen}} their bowling attack. While the game was taking place, Doug Insole, the chairman of the England selectors, introduced D'Oliveira to Isaacs, who offered him warm hospitality if he toured South Africa during the English winter. Deeply upset with his omission, D'Oliveira returned to play for Worcestershire once his twelfth man duties ended. Oborne suggests that, from a cricketing viewpoint, the decision to drop D'Oliveira looks odd, and that it may have been connected to the South African presence at Lord's. The replacement for D'Oliveira, Barry Knight, performed well in the second Test; D'Oliveira, by contrast, lost all batting form. From mid-June until August, bothered by the pressure over South Africa, he struggled to score, managing just 205 runs at an average of 12.81. He maintained his form as a bowler, <b>but</b> <b>critics</b> believed his chance had gone. In July, as part of a standard procedure, the MCC wrote to 30 leading players to ask if they were available to tour South Africa; D'Oliveira was not contacted. According to Fraser-Sampson, the idea that D'Oliveira was not then one of England's best 30 players was absurd; he writes that the selectors must therefore have been aware that Vorster would not accept his selection and they had consequently decided not to choose him.|$|E
5|$|The MCC team which toured Australia {{under the}} {{captaincy}} of Arthur Gilligan in 1924–25 lost the Test series 4–1, <b>but</b> <b>critics</b> thought the winning margin flattered the host country. Between {{them in the}} Test matches, Hobbs and Sutcliffe scored seven centuries and shared four opening partnerships which passed 100 runs. Hobbs began the tour well, and scored consistently in the matches before the Tests. In the first Test, in reply to Australia's first innings of 450, Hobbs and Sutcliffe opened with 157 runs. Hobbs went on to his seventh century against Australia, beating the previous record number in England-Australia Tests by Victor Trumper. Australia eventually set England a target of 605 runs. Hobbs and Sutcliffe shared their second century opening partnership of the game, but England lost by 193 runs. During the match, Hobbs became the leading run-scorer in Test cricket, passing the previous record of 3,412 runs set by Clem Hill in 1912. In the second Test, Australia scored 600 during the opening two days. In reply, Hobbs and Sutcliffe batted throughout the third day without being separated, scoring 283. They concentrated on defence but both men reached centuries, and the press praised their achievements. Even so, Australia won the game by 81 runs, and {{in the aftermath of}} the defeat, Cecil Parkin, a former Test bowler and vocal critic of Gilligan's captaincy, wrote a newspaper article suggesting that Hobbs should assume the leadership of the side. This suggestion provoked a reaction from Lord Hawke—"Pray God, no professional will ever captain England"—and subsequent press debate over the idea of Hobbs as captain. In reality, Hobbs had no desire to captain England.|$|E
