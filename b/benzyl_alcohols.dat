40|$|The {{selective}} oxidation of benzylic alcohols to carbonyl compounds, such as aldehydes and ketones, is a {{very important}} organic synthesis for industrial production {{and is one of the}} most challenging reactions in green chemistry. As a matter of fact, the aldehydes and ketones are key intermediates in perfumes, spices, flame retardants, pharmaceuticals and other fine chemicals. Although during past decades, a number of papers has been focused on developing new catalyst systems, for the selective oxidation of <b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohols</b> with mild, green, and economic process, it is still a big challenge in organic synthetic chemistry. In this study, a novel selective oxidation of <b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohols</b> to aldehydes and ketones was established by using H 2 O 2 (30...|$|E
40|$|Alloy {{nanoparticles}} (NPs) of {{gold and}} palladium on ZrO 2 support (Au–Pd@ZrO 2) {{were found to be}} highly active in oxidation of <b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohols</b> and can be used for the tandem synthesis of imines from <b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohols</b> and amines via a one-pot, two-step process at mild reaction conditions. The first step of the process is oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, excellent yields were achieved after 7 h reaction at 40 °C without addition of any base. In the second step, aniline was introduced into the reaction system to produced N-benzylideneaniline. The benzaldehyde obtained in the first step was completely consumed within 1 h. A range of <b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohols</b> and amines were investigated for the general applicability of the Au–Pd alloy catalysts. It is found that the performance of the catalysts depends on the Au–Pd metal contents and composition. The optimal catalyst is 3. 0 wt% Au–Pd@ZrO 2 with a Au:Pd molar ratio 1 : 1. The alloy NP catalyst exhibited superior catalytic properties to pure AuNP or PdNP because the surface of alloy NPs has higher charge heterogeneity than that of pure metal NPs according to simulation of density function theory (DFT...|$|E
40|$|The {{oxidative}} coupling of sp 3 hybridized carbon atoms by photocatalysis is {{a valuable}} synthetic method as stoichiometric oxidation reagents can be avoided and dihydrogen is the only byproduct of the reaction. Cadmium sulfide, a readily available semiconductor, {{was used as a}} visible light heterogeneous photocatalyst for the oxidative coupling of <b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohols</b> and benzyl amines by irradiation with blue light. Depending on the structure of the starting material, good to excellent yields of homocoupling products were obtained as mixtures of diastereomers. Cross-coupling between <b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohols</b> and benzyl amines gave product mixtures, but was selective for the coupling of tetrahydroisoquinolines to nitromethane. The results demonstrate that CdS is a suitable visible light photocatalyst for oxidative bond formation under anaerobic conditions...|$|E
40|$|Improvement {{of product}} {{selectivity}} {{is a major}} concern of the day. Presence of a coreactant can alter the rate as well as product selectivity of many key reactions like Friedel-Crafts benzylation. Single pot benzylation of o-xylene with benzyl chloride and <b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> was studied over transition metal exchanged pillared clay catalysts. Complete conversion of <b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> occured within one hour with 100 % monoalkylated product selectivity. The reaction of o-xylene with <b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> was found to proceed fast in presence of benzyl chloride in single pot, than when present alone as the benzylating species. This enhancement occurs at the expense of no reaction of benzyl chloride, which when present alone reacts faster than <b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Existence of a second transition metal exchanged between the pillars increased the rate of the reaction. A detailed investigation of the reaction variables suggested preferential adsorption of <b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> to catalyst active sites as the reason...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} <b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> a local {{anaesthetic}} commonly used for modification of membrane fluidity, on fluid phase endocytosis and on exocytosis {{have been investigated}} in MDCK cells. Fluid phase endocytosis in confluent cells monolayer grown on solid support was determined, at 37 °C, by the uptake of the fluorescent dye Lucifer Yellow (LY). Exocytosis was estimated from the release of LY by cells preloaded with the dye. Addition of <b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> resulted in a concentration dependent inhibition of fluid phase endocytosis. For 30 mM <b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> the inhibition obtained (83 %) compared with that produced by preincubating the cells in a solution made hypertonic with 0. 25 M sucrose. The inhibitory effect of <b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> was reversed within 30 min by washing. Endocytosis inhibition by <b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> was also observed in LLC-PK 1 cells and OK cells, two renal epithelial cell lines of proximal tubule origin. In contrast, <b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> {{had no effect on}} exocytosis in LLC-PK 1 cells, a limited but significant (15 % at 30 mM) stimulatory effect on exocytosis in MDCK cells and a marked stimulatory effect (75 % at 30 mM) in OK cells. These data demonstrate that <b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> affects endocytosis and exocytosis processes in renal epithelial cells. They suggest that membrane fluidity may alter membrane trafficking in living renal epithelial cells...|$|R
40|$|TOL plasmid pWW 0 {{specifies}} enzymes for the oxidative catabolism of toluene and xylenes. The upper pathway converts the {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} to aromatic carboxylic acids via corresponding alcohols and aldehydes and involves three enzymes: xylene oxygenase, <b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> dehydrogenase, and benzaldehyde dehydrogenase. The synthesis of these enzymes is positively {{regulated by the}} product of xylR. Determination of upper pathway enzyme levels in bacteria carrying Tn 5 insertion mutant derivatives of plasmid pWW 0 - 161 {{has shown that the}} genes for upper pathway enzymes are organized in an operon with the following order: promoter-xylC (benzaldehyde dehydrogenase gene[s]) -xylA (xylene oxygenase gene[s]) -xylB (<b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> dehydrogenase gene). Subcloning of the upper pathway genes in a lambda pL promoter-containing vector and analysis of their expression in Escherichia coli K- 12 confirmed this order. Two distinct enzymes were found to attack <b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> namely, xylene oxygenase and <b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> dehydrogenase; and their catalytic activities were additive in the conversion of <b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> to benzaldehyde. The fact that <b>benzyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> is both a product and a substrate of xylene oxygenase indicates that this enzyme has a relaxed substrate specificity...|$|R
