5|$|By contrast, the {{remainder}} of Europe saw stone towers being used in castles, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way that fulfilled the range of functions seen in the western European keeps. In the Low Countries, it became popular for the local nobility to build stand-alone, square towers, but rarely {{as part of a}} wider castle. Similarly, square stone towers became popular in Venice, but these did not fulfil the same role as western keeps. In Germany, rectangular stone castles began to replace motte-and-bailey castles from the 12th century onwards. These designs included stone versions of the traditional Bergfriede, which still remained distinct from the domestic keeps used in more western parts of Europe, with the occasional notable exception, such as the large, residential Bergfried at Eltville Castle.|$|E

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of Christianity through the tenth century, Christian theologians saw the Eucharist as the church's participation in Christ's sacrifice. Christ {{was believed to be}} present in the Eucharist, but there were differences over the way in which this occurred. The School of Antioch in the Eastern Roman Empire, along with Hilary of Poitiers and Ambrose in the Western Roman Empire, taught a realist, metabolic, or somatic view, where the elements of the Eucharist were believed to be changed into Christ's body and blood. The influential fourth-century Western theologian Augustine of Hippo, on the other hand, held that Christ is really present in the elements of the Eucharist, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bodily manner, because his body remains in heaven. Augustine believed the Eucharist is a spiritual eating which allows Christians to become part of Christ's body. Western theologians in the three centuries following Augustine did not elaborate on the way Christ is present in the Eucharist, but emphasized the transforming power of the sacrament.|$|E

5|$|The Lorentz {{group is}} a Lie group and has as such a Lie algebra, The Lie algebra is a vector space of {{matrices}} {{that can be said}} to model the group near the identity.

The link between the (matrix) Lie algebra and the (matrix) Lie group is the matrix exponential. It is one-to-one near the identity in the group.|$|E
5|$|A further Scottish {{distinction}} {{from the}} UK flag days {{is that on}} Saint Andrew's Day, (30 November), the Union Flag will only be flown where a building {{has more than one}} flagpole; the Saltire will not be lowered {{to make way for the}} Union Flag where a single flagpole is present. If there are two or more flagpoles present, the Saltire may be flown in addition to the Union Flag <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> superior position. This distinction arose after Members of the Scottish Parliament complained that Scotland was the only country in the world where the potential existed for the citizens of a country to be unable to fly their national flag on their country's national day. (In recent years, embassies of the United Kingdom have also flown the Saltire to mark St Andrew's Day). Many bodies of the Scottish Government use the flag as a design basis for their logo; for example, Safer Scotland's emblem depicts a lighthouse shining beams in a saltire shape onto a blue sky. Other Scottish bodies, both private and public, have also used the saltire in similar ways.|$|E
