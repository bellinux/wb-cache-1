Among them, two sub-sectors {{play an important role}} reflected by the steady growth of their <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>totals,</b> namely the investment funds and the insurance corporations and pension funds (ICPF).

Given the ICPF crucial role in portfolio decisions of households and the interaction between insurers and pension funds, banks, other {{financial intermediaries}}, and more broadly financial markets, the importance of more detailed and timely data for this sector has risen. These statistics are being developed under a “short-term approach ” based on available sources, mostly supervisory authorities, i. e. without implementing a new data collection from reporting agents, with the main objective to set up a framework for timely quarterly estimates of euro area statistics. For its further development, and in the light of increasing user needs in particular for financial stability analysis purposes, the ECB cooperates closely with the Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors (CEIOPS) in order to ensure consistency of future reporting requirements under Solvency II and to minimise reporting burden...|$|R
