The original publication {{is available at}} [URL] alien species can have serious adverse impacts on both {{the environment and the}} economy. Being able to predict the impacts of an alien species could assist in preventing or reducing these impacts. This study aimed to establish whether there are any life history traits consistently correlated with the <b>impacts</b> of alien <b>birds</b> across two continents, Europe and Australia, as a first step toward identifying life history traits that may have the potential to be adopted as predictors of alien <b>bird</b> <b>impacts.</b> A recently established impact scoring system was used in combination with a literature review to allocate impact scores to alien bird species with self-sustaining populations in Australia.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{developing}} a windshield for aircraft which will withstand the effect of <b>bird</b> <b>impacts</b> during flight is a difficult one, as {{an estimate of the}} striking energy will indicate. If the average speed of the airplane is considered to be about 200 miles per hour and that of the bird about 70 miles per hour, the speed of the bird relative to the airplane may be as great as 400 feet per second. If a 4 -pound bird is involved, a maximum impact energy of approximately 10, 000 foot-pounds must be dissipated. To obtain this energy in a drop test in the Washington Monument, it would be necessary to drop a 20 -pound weight down the 500 -foot shaft. For both theoretical and practical reasons, it is necessary to keep the mass and speed more nearly like those to be encountered. However, to get an impact of about 10, 000 foot-pounds with a 4 -pound falling body, it would be necessary to drop it from a height of approximately one-half mile, neglecting air resistance.

40|$|Bird {{strike is}} a {{significant}} design criterion for leading edges of wing and empennage structures. The certification clauses demand that the aircraft be able to successfully land after the leading edges being struck with a standard bird at cruise velocity of the aircraft for a given altitude. Therefore, the approach followed {{in the design of}} leading edges for bird strike is to have a leading edge with improved energy absorption capability which transfers lesser reaction forces to the supporting structures like spars. Since leading edge is the front part of these structures, a careful design to maximise the energy absorption is followed to ensure less damages to supporting structures. In this aspect, a parametric study can help in identifying the parameters which influence the impact behaviour of the leading edges during <b>bird</b> <b>impact.</b> However, parametric evaluation through <b>bird</b> <b>impact</b> testing is highly time consuming and expensive. Hence, parametric evaluation through simulation is attempted as prediction of <b>bird</b> <b>impact</b> behaviour through simulation has become a reality with the availability of modern computers having high computational capability. The ability of ABAQUS/Explicit to effectively handle severely nonlinear behaviour such as contact makes it very attractive choice for the simulation of these high speed events. The major challenges in bird strike simulation are bird modelling, bird - target interface modelling and target failure modelling. The bird model identified was validated with the pressure distribution characteristics obtained from an experimental study defined in the literatures, wherein the <b>bird</b> <b>impact</b> on rigid plates were evaluated.

40|$|As well known, in the {{analysis}} of <b>bird</b> <b>impact</b> events the bird is often reduced, even experimentally, to a surrogate projectile modeled as a weakly compressible fluid (typically a mixture of water and air).

On the other hand, classical Lagrangian methods cannot cope with the extremely large deformations experienced by the projectile during the impact. The Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) is a Lagrangian particle method that can account for very large deformations, preserving the robustness and generality of the finite element method, and thus owning a key advantage over other approaches, e. g.
