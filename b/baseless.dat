5|$|The word salary {{comes from}} the Latin word for salt. The {{reason for this is}} unknown; a {{persistent}} modern claim that the Roman Legions were sometimes paid in salt is <b>baseless.</b>|$|E
5|$|Creationists {{argue against}} {{evolution}} {{on the grounds}} that it cannot explain certain non-evolutionary processes, such as abiogenesis, the Big Bang, or the meaning of life. In such instances, evolution is being redefined to refer to the entire history of the universe, and it is argued that if one aspect of the universe is seemingly inexplicable, the entire body of scientific theories must be <b>baseless.</b> At this point, objections leave the arena of evolutionary biology and become general scientific or philosophical disputes.|$|E
5|$|The {{disappearance}} attracted sustained {{international interest}} and saturation {{coverage in the}} UK reminiscent {{of the death of}} Diana in 1997. The McCanns were subjected to intense scrutiny and <b>baseless</b> allegations of involvement in their daughter's death, particularly in the tabloid press and on Twitter. In 2008 they received damages and front-page apologies from Express Newspapers, and in 2011 they testified before the Leveson Inquiry into British press misconduct, lending support to those arguing for tighter press regulation.|$|E
5|$|On May 25, the {{day before}} the Dunkirk evacuation, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov {{presented}} a diplomatic note that accused the Lithuanian government of abducting three Soviet soldiers stationed in Lithuania in accordance with the terms of the mutual assistance treaty. The note alleged that two soldiers had been tortured to obtain Russian military secrets but managed to escape, and that the third, Butayev, was murdered. Earlier in May, Butayev had deserted his unit and was searched by the Lithuanian police. When found, he committed suicide. The Lithuanian government replied that the accusations were <b>baseless,</b> but promised a full investigation of the incident and convened a special commission. However, the commission's requests for detailed information, including interviews, photographs, physical descriptions, or other data that could further the investigation, went unanswered. The official Soviet stance was that Lithuania needed to carry out the investigation on its own and that its requests were an attempt to shift responsibility to the Russians.|$|E

25|$|In Religious Technology Center v. Gerbode, 1994 WL 228607 (C.D. Cal. 1994) (against Frank A. Gerbode, {{inventor}} of Traumatic Incident Reduction), a Rule 11 sanction of $8,887.50 was imposed against Helena Kobrin, {{an attorney for}} the Church, for bringing <b>baseless</b> and frivolous claims.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} that Khan had disagreements with director Reema Kagti {{over the issue of}} his 2012 film Talaash, causing significant delays in the film's release. However, Khan said that the claims were <b>baseless.</b> The film was a hit in India and overseas markets.|$|E
25|$|According to {{numerous}} Chinese-language media outlets, Wang is {{the nephew of}} Wang Yeping, wife of former President and General Secretary Jiang Zemin, although some political insiders from Shenzhen have dismissed this as a <b>baseless</b> rumour. Nevertheless, he was widely {{considered to be a}} protege of Jiang, who is also from Jiangsu province.|$|E
25|$|This {{information}} was combined with legitimate historical mentions of the Attacotti to produce inaccurate histories {{and to make}} <b>baseless</b> conjectures. For example, Edward Gibbon combined De Situ Britanniae with St. Jerome's description of the Attacotti by musing on {{the possibility that a}} ‘race of cannibals’ had once dwelt in the neighbourhood of Glasgow.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the factors}} that caused Sir Alan to fire Matthew was his confrontational {{attitude}} with other candidates, affecting the unity of any team he was part of. This was noted during a fight with Tim from First Forte, when suddenly he made a <b>baseless</b> accusation about Tim stealing their equipment.|$|E
25|$|In April 2014 and May 2014, the MCPD {{responded to}} several bomb threats called against {{public high schools}} in the county by a Canadian {{teenager}} from Ottawa, Canada. In all three cases, the threats were determined to be <b>baseless</b> after the schools in question were evacuated and searched for any explosives, in which none were found.|$|E
25|$|Tengku Fakhry {{had always}} {{maintained}} {{that money was}} not the issue {{and that it was}} about his dignity and reputation. He said he was forced to initiate legal proceedings to clear his name as the allegations of physical and sexual abuse were <b>baseless</b> and meant to disparage him {{in the eyes of the}} members of the royalty, the government and the public.|$|E
25|$|The {{film-maker}} concerned has {{a history}} of making <b>baseless</b> claims about UNRWA, all of which we have investigated and demonstrated to be patently false. It has long been the practice of the film-maker to show non-UNRWA activities and portray them as activities of UNRWA. He has done this again and we again reject his allegations. Our repeated rejection of his falsehoods is a matter of public record.|$|E
25|$|In two {{separate}} incidents {{officials of the}} Pakistani High Commission in Dhaka, were alleged to be financing the terrorist activities of the banned Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh organization. Diplomatic official Mazhar Khan was charged by Bangladesh's foreign ministry of running an illegal Indian currency business in Dhaka beside alleged links with militants. However, Pakistan's foreign office maintains that Allegations against him are <b>baseless</b> and the incident is unfortunate.|$|E
25|$|The launch {{was delayed}} several times for unclear reasons. At one point, it was rumoured that the launch had been {{cancelled}} completely due {{to pressure from}} the US Government. Indian and Israeli authorities denied this, however, citing technical problems instead. In Israel it was rumoured that the launch had been delayed due to Iranian pressure on the Indian government. However this was eventually proven to be <b>baseless</b> speculation.|$|E
25|$|The lawsuit {{charged that}} Sheriff Arpaio and the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office (MCSO) unlawfully instituted a pattern and {{practice}} of targeting Latino drivers and passengers in Maricopa County during traffic stops, and that MCSO’s practices discriminated {{on the basis of}} race in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and resulted in prolonged traffic stops and <b>baseless</b> extended detentions in violation of the Fourth Amendment.|$|E
25|$|On 14 December 2006, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Jendayi Frazer {{warned that}} al-Qaeda cell {{operatives}} were controlling the Islamic Courts Union, the Islamist faction of Somalia rapidly {{taking control of}} the southern area of the country. The next day, ICU Information Secretary Abdirahim Ali Mudey denied the allegation as <b>baseless.</b> Frazer later announced that the United States has no intention of committing troops to Somalia to root out al-Qaeda.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 2000s, the city {{government}} razed some of the stables and the club house, ostensibly to redevelop the land. At the time, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals publicly investigated allegations by city officials that the horses were being mistreated. The allegations proved <b>baseless.</b> However, with the land razed and redevelopment progressing, many horses had to be moved. In the subsequent decade, a few dozen horses have remained.|$|E
25|$|Leslie Sachs, {{author of}} The Virginia Ghost Murders (1998), claimed there were {{similarities}} between his novel and Cornwell's The Last Precinct. In 2000, he sent letters to Cornwell's publisher, started a web page, and placed stickers on {{copies of his}} novel alleging that Cornwell was committing plagiarism. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia granted Cornwell a preliminary injunction against Sachs, opining that his claims {{were likely to be}} found <b>baseless.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1997, the {{international}} lawyer Kōnen Tsuchiya filed {{a class action}} suit against the Japanese government, demanding reparations {{for the actions of}} Unit 731, using evidence filed by Professor Makoto Ueda of Rikkyo University. All Japanese court levels found that the suit was <b>baseless.</b> No findings of fact were made about the existence of human experimentation, but the decision of the court was that reparations are determined by international treaties and not by national court cases.|$|E
25|$|Hughes v. Fairchild: Hughes Aircraft sued Fairchild {{arguing that}} their {{researchers}} developed the Hoerni's process earlier. According to Fairchild lawyers, {{this case was}} <b>baseless,</b> but could take a few years, during which Fairchild could not sell the license to Hoerni's process. Therefore, Fairchild chose to settle with Hughes out of court. Hughes acquired the rights {{to one of the}} seventeen points of the Hoerni's patent, and then exchanged it for {{a small percentage of the}} future licensing incomes of Fairchild.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the Leicester City trio of Paul Dickov, Frank Sinclair and Keith Gillespie {{spent a week}} {{in prison}} after being accused of sexual assault while on a {{training}} break at the La Manga resort in Spain with their team. However, the case was dropped after forensic evidence showed the accusations to be <b>baseless.</b> Although the players accused were ultimately innocent, the scandal led to a media outcry about footballers and their behaviour, {{especially with regard to}} children who look up to them.|$|E
25|$|In May, the AKP {{appeared}} to have started a smear campaign against Meral Akşener, one of the MHP's most prominent politicians, claiming to be {{in possession of a}} video recording of her with private content. Akşener subsequently began legal proceedings against two pro-government journalists whom she accused of starting the defamation campaign against her. One of these journalists, Latif Erdoğan, claimed that the Gülen Movement had obtained the recording to blackmail Akşener, though both Akşener and Gülen's lawyer denied the claims and accused them of being <b>baseless.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is not {{surprising}} in the context that West reacted to U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy differently from her colleagues. They saw a demagogue terrorizing liberals and leftists with <b>baseless</b> accusations of Communist conspiracy. West saw an oaf blundering into the minefield of Communist subversion. For her, McCarthy was right to pursue Communists with fervor, even if his methods were roughshod, though her mild reaction to McCarthy provoked powerful revulsion among those {{on the left and}} dismay even among anti-Communist liberals. She refused, however, to amend her views.|$|E
25|$|For his New Health, Lane {{eventually}} became {{viewed as a}} crank. Lane's explanation of the association between constipation and illness as due to autointoxication is generally regarded by gastroenterologists as wholly fictitious. And Lane's earlier surgeries for chronic constipation have been depicted as <b>baseless.</b> Yet constipation remains a major health problem associating with diverse signs and symptoms, including psychological—sometimes still explained as Lane's disease—and total colectomy has been revived since the 1980s as a mainstream treatment, although dietary intervention is now {{the first line of}} action.|$|E
25|$|Branch {{believed}} that {{the rejection of the}} Chicago group was based on anti-Black sentiment among Israeli Jews. Branch was criticized by Seth Forman, who said the claims seemed <b>baseless.</b> He said that Israel had airlifted thousands of black Ethiopian Jews to Israel in the early 1990s. A group of American civil rights activists led by Bayard Rustin investigated the 1966 case. They concluded that racism was not the cause of the Black Hebrews' rejection in Israel. They were considered a cult rather than a group of historic Jewish descendants.|$|E
25|$|While {{the family}} {{may never know}} what has {{happened}} to Caylee Marie Anthony, they now have closure for this chapter of their life. They will now begin the long process of rebuilding their lives. Despite the <b>baseless</b> defense chosen by Casey Anthony, the family believes that the Jury made a fair decision based on the evidence presented, the testimony presented, the scientific information presented and the rules that were given to them by the Honorable Judge Perry to guide them. The family hopes that they will be given the time by the media to reflect on this verdict and decide the best way to move forward privately.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{came under}} criticism for its alleged use of excessive force on 26 May 2011 when it dispersed protesters led by Nino Burjanadze, among others, with {{tear gas and}} rubber bullets after they refused to clear Rustaveli avenue for an independence day parade despite the expiration of their demonstration permit and despite being offered to choose an alternative venue. While human rights activists maintained that the protests were peaceful, the government pointed out that many protesters were masked and armed with heavy sticks and molotov cocktails. Georgian opposition leader Nino Burjanadze said the accusations of planning a coup were <b>baseless,</b> and that the protesters' actions were legitimate.|$|E
25|$|In August, the Party's Central Committee sent {{a letter}} of protest to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, stating its displeasure at having an anti-Albanian Soviet Ambassador in Tirana. The Fourth Congress of the Party, held from 13 to 20 February 1961, was the last meeting that the Soviet Union or other Eastern European nations {{attended}} in Albania. During the congress, the Soviet Union was condemned while China was praised. Mehmet Shehu stated that while {{many members of the}} Party were accused of tyranny, this was a <b>baseless</b> charge and unlike the Soviet Union, Albania was led by genuine Marxists.|$|E
25|$|This {{illustration}} {{serves to}} show that the work is not intended for scholars alone, but also for popular instruction; and that the statement, so often repeated since the time of Meiri, that the Sheiltot was a book merely for the instruction of youth, is also <b>baseless.</b> It is more probable that it is a collection of aggadic-halakic sermons, which Aḥa delivered in Palestine, where certainly he was held in high regard. With the decline of rabbinical knowledge in Palestine, Aḥa would have found but few pupils for pure halakic instruction; and he therefore endeavored to add aggadic elements to his lectures, in obedience to the general disposition of the Palestinians, who just then favored Aggadah.|$|E
