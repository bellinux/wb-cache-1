40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the basic {{aerodynamic}} characteristics of conventional balls and new <b>balls,</b> using a <b>wind</b> tunnel for the experiments. We found that the critical Reynolds number for conventional balls was approximately 270, 000, and that for new balls was approximately 220, 000. The drag coefficient of new balls at supercritical regime was about 0. 17, showing a slightly higher value than for conventional balls. Comparing the deviation of coordinate values at the landing point of the ball in flight near the critical Reynolds regime, the new balls tended to have a smaller deviation than conventional balls...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the basic {{aerodynamic}} characteristics of a previously developed 8 -panel soccer ball with those of a new 32 -panel soccer <b>ball</b> by conducting <b>wind</b> tunnel tests. Experimental results show that the critical Reynolds number (Re) was approximately 3. 3 × 105 for the 8 -panel ball and approximately 2. 4 × 105 for the new ball, i. e., the Re of the new ball was slightly lower than that of the 8 -panel ball. We conclude that the aerodynamic drag coefficient of the new 32 -panel ball is closer to that of a golf ball than an 8 -panel ball...|$|R

Giovanni Paisiello's opera Pirro, which opened weeks later in December 1787, marks the first use of the term banda {{in the sense of a}} wind band. While Almaviva's serenade is accompanied from the pit in both Paisiello's (1782) and Rossini's (1816) Il barbiere di Siviglia, by 1818 Rossini's opera Ricciardo e Zoraide the banda was established as an independent institution in Italian opera houses.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAerodynamic drag {{on sports}} balls is {{typically}} measured in wind tunnels. There {{is a concern}} that fixtures needed to support the <b>ball</b> in a <b>wind</b> tunnel may influence its drag. Measurements under game conditions have been attempted, but are difficult to interpret from the data scatter and are not controlled. The following considers drag measurements from a ball propelled through static air in a laboratory setting. High speed light gates were used to measure drag, including the effects of ball rotation. Drag was observed {{to depend on the}} ball speed, rotation, roughness, and orientation. A so-called drag crisis was observed for a smooth sphere and was comparable to wind tunnel data. Rough sports balls, such as a baseball, showed evidence of a small drag crisis that was less apparent than the smooth sphere...|$|R
500|$|In 1958, American {{physicist}} William Higinbotham {{worked in}} the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York {{as the head of}} the instrumentation division.

Once a year, the government research facility held an exhibition for the public, with one day each for high school students, college students, and the general public. The exhibition largely consisted of tours and static displays, with some attempts at making displays with [...] "action", so for the 1958 exhibition Higinbotham decided to make an interactive display to entertain the visitors.

40|$|A {{system was}} designed, built and tested {{in order to}} test the {{aerodynamic}} properties of a standard golf <b>ball</b> in a <b>wind</b> tunnel manufactured by ELD, Inc. model 406 (B). The system consists of a rotating shaft, on which the golf ball is attached, connected to a two-axis force transducer. Additionally, an automated data acquisition system was built for enhanced precision of measurements. Data for wind speeds up to 160 ft/s and rotational speeds up to 8, 600 rpm were obtained and analyzed. The purpose of the designed apparatus was to allow for studies to better understand the lift and drag coefficients of golf balls during their flight. Subsequent to testing, {{it was found that the}} force transducer was not adequate to measure the lift and drag coefficients with sufficient accuracy.

40|$|Scarce data {{is a major}} {{challenge}} to scaling robot learning to truly complex tasks, as we need to generalize locally learned policies over different "contexts". Bayesian optimization approaches to contextual policy search (CPS) offer data-efficient policy learning that generalize over a context space. We propose to improve data- efficiency by factoring typically considered contexts into two components: target- type contexts that correspond to a desired outcome of the learned behavior, e. g. target position for throwing a ball; and environment type contexts that correspond to some state of the environment, e. g. initial <b>ball</b> position or <b>wind</b> speed. Our key observation is that experience can be directly generalized over target-type contexts. Based on that we introduce Factored Contextual Policy Search with Bayesian Optimization for both passive and active learning settings. Preliminary results show faster policy generalization on a simulated toy problem. Comment: BayesOpt 2016, NIPS Workshop on Bayesian Optimization. 5 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

Hakeem Olajuwon, the Cougars' star center, was plagued by altitude-induced fatigue during the second half despite leading the team in scoring and rebounds and required oxygen to continue playing. With Olajuwon on the bench, Houston head coach Guy Lewis decided that in order to protect the lead and the health of his big man at the same time, the Cougars needed to start slowing the game down.
