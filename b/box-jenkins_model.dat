5000|$|A 2006 {{study by}} gun lobby-affiliated {{researchers}} Jeanine Baker and Samara McPhedran found that after Australia enacted the National Firearms Agreement (NFA), a gun control law, in 1996, gun-related suicides {{may have been}} affected, but no other parameter appeared to have been. Another 2006 study, led by Simon Chapman, found that after this law was enacted in 1996 in Australia, the country went {{more than a decade}} without any mass shootings, and gun-related deaths (especially suicides) declined dramatically. The latter of these studies also criticized the former for using a time-series analysis despite the fact that, according to Chapman et al., [...] "calculating mortality rates and then treating them as a number in a time series ignores the natural variability inherent in the counts that make up the numerator of the rate." [...] Chapman et al. also said that Baker and McPhedran used the <b>Box-Jenkins</b> <b>model</b> inappropriately. A 2010 study looking at the effect of the NFA on gun-related deaths found that the law [...] "did not have any large effects on reducing firearm homicide or suicide rates," [...] although David Hemenway has criticized this study for using a structural break test despite the fact that such tests can miss the effects of policies in the presence of lags, or when the effect occurs over several years. Another study, published the same year, found that Australia's gun buyback program reduced gun-related suicide rates by almost 80%, while non-gun death rates were not significantly affected. Other research has argued that although gun suicide rates fell after the NFA was enacted, the NFA may not have been responsible for this decrease and [...] "a change in social and cultural attitudes" [...] may have instead been at least partly responsible. In 2016, Chapman co-authored another study that found that after the NFA was passed, there were no mass shootings in the country (as of May 2016), and that gun-related death rates declined more quickly after the NFA than they did before it. The study also found, however, that non-gun suicide and homicide rates declined even more quickly after the NFA, leading the authors to conclude that [...] "it is not possible to determine whether the change in firearm deaths {{can be attributed to the}} gun law reforms." ...|$|E

Brown's exponentially smoothed constant, linear and six- and eight-term harmonic models are compared with two seasonal factor <b>models</b> and ten <b>Box-Jenkins</b> <b>models.</b> The seasonal factor models are Winters' three parameter model and a single parameter model developed by the author. The forecasting errors {{of the best of}} the <b>Box-Jenkins</b> <b>models</b> that were tested are either approximately equal to or greater than the errors of the corresponding exponentially smoothed models. Test results indicate that the four exponentially smoothed seasonal models yield approximately equivalent accuracy for most data series. If a sharply defined pattern exists, the seasonal factor models can yield smaller forecast errors than the harmonic models. If no seasonal pattern exists, the errors of the exponentially smoothed models with seasonal components are only slightly greater than those of the constant and linear models. ...|$|R

The model is a static time series model. Therefore, forecasts of the Dow Jones Index rely on forecasts of the independent variables of the model. In this paper we examine the VL-DJ model for econometric soundness (balance, dynamic completeness, parameter stability, and economic plausibility) and examine, vis-à-vis an out-of-sample forecasting experiment, how useful it is for forecasting the Dow Jones Index from 1 – 6 years ahead when compared to a simple <b>Box-Jenkins</b> <b>model</b> of the Dow Jones Index. We find the VL-DJ model to be econometrically sound, the Transfer Function implementation of the VL-DJ model to be no more accurate than a <b>Box-Jenkins</b> <b>model</b> of the Dow Jones Series but that the “in-house ” implementation of the VL-DJ model by the Value Line Corporation Staff has historically provided more accurate forecasts than those produced by the <b>Box-Jenkins</b> <b>model</b> we examined. Irrespective of forecasting accuracy, the VL-DJ model is of historical importance in explaining the movements in stock market indices like the Dow Jones Index. Earnings and dividend growth provide positive impetus to the growth in the Dow Jones Index while interest rate yields, as typified by Moody’s AAA Bond Yield, inversely impact its growth...|$|E

40|$|Malaysia is very {{fortunate}} {{to be free from}} natural disaster such as earth quake, volcano and typhoon. Unfortunately, the most severe natural disaster experiencing in Malaysia is flood. The probability of flood may occur had been increase due to the climate change and global warming that happened in Malaysia throughout the year. One of the major factor that contribute to flood is the heavy rainfall or maximum rainfall. Hence, in this study, mathematical analysis had been performed by studying the rainfall pattern of the past years and predict the future pattern. Ulu Sebol station situated in Johor was chosen as the rainfall data station since Johor is one of the state that experienced the worst flood in the year 2006. Accuracy {{plays an important role in}} choosing the forecasting techniques in order to make prediction of the future rainfall data. But, before forecasting can be made, estimation of the model parameter must be done. In this thesis, an approach that combines the Box-Jenkins methodology for ARIMA model and Genetic Algorithm (GA) had been introduced as a new approach in estimating the parameter and forecasting. A total of 127 series of data had been used in this study starting from January 2000 and these data were classified as monthly maximum rainfall data. MINITAB 16 computer package was used in analyzing the data and for the development of <b>Box-Jenkins</b> <b>model.</b> Meanwhile, JAVA was used in estimating the parameter of <b>Box-Jenkins</b> <b>model</b> by using Genetic Algorithm. The accuracy of the results were measured by concerning the minimum Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). By using MINITAB 16, ARIMA(0, 1, 1) was chosen as the best model that fits to the data. The best estimate of theta given by MINITAB is � = 0. 9857 with MAPE 0. 6526. By adopting GA in searching the best parameter value, GA gives an outstanding performance with the best estimate of theta is 0. 3427 and MAPE with 0. 5416. Hence, Genetic Algorithm was proven to work well in estimating the parameter of <b>Box-Jenkins</b> <b>model...</b>|$|E

Such observations {{are likely to}} be dependent. In environmental medicine, where series such as daily concentrations of pollutants are collected and analysed, it is evident that dependence of consecutive measurements may be important.

Dependence of consecutive observations may be equally important when data such as blood glucose are recorded within a single patient.
