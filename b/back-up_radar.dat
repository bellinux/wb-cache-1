50|$|Ramore {{contained}} an AN/FPS-3 search radar, AB/TPS-502 Height finder radar and an AN/FPS-502 Back-Up Search radar. The <b>back-up</b> <b>radar</b> could function as either search or height radar. The operating radius was approximately 180 miles which stretched as far west as Hearst {{and as far}} north as Moosonee.|$|E
50|$|With {{the recent}} {{memory of the}} German V-2 Rocket program, the {{development}} of the Russian Nuclear Missile Program, and the subsequent development of the DEW Line (Distant Early Warning System) in the high Arctic in the late 1950s/early 1960s, the Department of National Defence felt it prudent to also construct secondary <b>back-up</b> <b>radar</b> stations further south. Cranberry Portage, with its road and rail access being conveniently located 60 kilometres from a perceived Russian military target like Flin Flon Area mines and smelters, was an ideal location to establish such a back-up system in the interests of national defence, and became one of the locations for a Mid-Canada Line Installation.|$|E
50|$|The F-111s of the Royal Australian Air Force and the U.S. Air Force have a forward-looking, terrain-following radar (TFR) system {{connected}} via {{digital computer}} to their automatic pilots. Beneath the nose radome are two separate TFR antennae, each providing individual {{information to the}} dual-channel TFR system. In case of a failure in that system, the F-111 has a <b>back-up</b> <b>radar</b> altimeter system, also connected to the automatic pilot. Then, if the F-111 ever dips below the preset minimum altitude (for example, 15 meters) for any reason, its automatic pilot is commanded to put the F-111 into a 2G fly-up (a steep nose-up climb) to avoid crashing into terrain or water. Even in combat, the hazard of a collision is far greater than the danger of being detected by an enemy. Similar systems are used by F/A-18 Super Hornet aircraft operated by Australia and the United States.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{synthesize}} current practices and procedures on the prevention of backing fatalities in highway work zones. First, general work zone safety hazards are reviewed, particularly blind areas are identified. Second, engineering controls currently in use are examined and explained to help understand what steps can be taken to prevent future backing fatalities. Third, administrative controls (including signalers, drivers, and workers-on-foot training) are also discussed. Fourth, existing technology controls are reviewed for use in aiding equipment operators in identifying when pedestrian personnel are in dangerous areas around their equipment (i. e., <b>back-up</b> camera, <b>radar).</b> Fifth, recommendations are made based on the comprehensive review of the backover fatality prevention techniques in construction work zones and the conducted testing results of several commercially available systems. Recommendations on engineering and technology controls are discussed, with detailed information such as improving internal traffic control plans, and integrating technology with traffic control plans. Information and drawings are provided to illustrate how to design work zones, and the internal traffic flow diagrams are created using the integrated technology available, and site specific characteristics. The drawings represent examples of using different types of technology, in different scenarios using the proper legend, as well as using the proper general and technology notes to help explain the traffic control plan, ensuring that full comprehension is made. Recommendations on administrative controls are also given such as how to conduct safety meetings, electing safety officers, how to set regulations and guidelines for workers, and how to handle training. Training should be used as a backover fatality prevention method for pedestrian workers, flaggers, spotters, and equipment operators. Finally, a summary and discussion of future research directions are also given...|$|R
50|$|RCAF Station St. Sylvestre, Site C-6, was a Group II PINETREE Medium Radar Site, whose {{essential}} services, operations, with staffing, {{and their}} associated costs were {{shared with the}} USAF,until June 1961. As a Type C Station, it consisted of an Operations Main Building, of RCAF design, with two adjoining radar towers of similar construction, and twenty-five associated service buildings. The ‘search’ radar, with a range 75-100 km, was installed {{on the roof of}} the ‘main’ operations building and on two adjacent towers were the height finder, and a back-up ‘search’. Recurring wind damage, and winter weather, led to the housing of the radars inside 15-metre diameter inflated rubber domes. Callsign: Eaglebeak, St. Sylvestre’s operational capabilities first included (1953) a GCI Ground Controlled Intercept function, using two GE AN/CPS-6B Medium Radar, with Early Warning capability, a three-dimensional radar capable of providing range, azimuth and height of a target. In 1955, the Station installed its AN/TPS-502 (Back-up) Height Range Finder and its AN/FPS-502 (<b>Back-up)</b> Search Surveillance <b>Radar.</b> In late 1961 the GE AN/CPS-6B was replaced by a Bendix AN/FPS-20 Long Range (Search) Radar, combined with two GE AN/FPS-6B Long-Range Height Finding Radars.The Main Building radars were supported by sites on two adjacent hills designated RX (Receiver) on Mont 'Handkerchief' and TX (Emmitter).|$|R
40|$|A {{solar power}} {{satellite}} (SPS) is a satellite dedicated to collecting solar energy on orbit, transforming it into microwave or laser energy, and beaming it to a receiving {{station on the}} ground. The transmitted energy is converted into DC or AC power for consumer use. Even a test version of the SPS would be a challenging and expensive undertaking due to the amounts of energy which need to be collected. Satellites measured in hundreds of meters and {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars are required for an accurate demonstration. It has been suggested that useful measurements can be made for substantially less if the beaming direction is reversed. A 30 kg, cubic satellite with 31 cm square faces costing under two million dollars is presented. The spacecraft is to receive, rectify and measure microwave power beamed from a highpower, ground-based radar station. Secondary payload opportunities have been analyzed in conjunction with the applicability, availability, and cost of government radar stations. Primary and <b>back-up</b> <b>radar</b> stations have been chosen. Orbital constraints recommended the selection of respective primary and back-up launch vehicles. The satellite is being designed to survive the launch environments of both launchers to increase the likelihood of mission success...|$|E
