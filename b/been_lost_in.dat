5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the storm, Congress appointed a bipartisan committee to investigate the response to Hurricane Katrina and the preparations prior to its landfall. The committee concluded that the forecasts given by the National Weather Service were timely, were not responsible for failures in other agencies, and were likely responsible for saving thousands of lives that would have otherwise <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the raging hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{days after}} the sinking of Irish Oak, on 24 May 1943, Admiral Dönitz ordered a U-boat {{withdrawal}} from the Atlantic. Of their operational fleet, 41 U-boats – or 25% – had <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> Black May, against a total of 50 Allied merchant ships destroyed. The Battle of the Atlantic was over.|$|E
5|$|The {{design for}} the Königsbergs was {{prepared}} in 1913. The design was an incremental improvement over the previous , with a larger hull and greater displacement, but with the same armament, speed, and armor protection. By 1916, thirteen German light cruisers had <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the course of World War I; after they were commissioned, the ships of the Königsberg class took the names of four of these lost cruisers.|$|E

5|$|The lectotype {{chosen for}} the species came from Marstrand, Sweden, but it is assumed to have <b>been</b> <b>lost.</b> <b>In</b> 1814, writing for The Edinburgh Encyclopaedia, William Elford Leach erected a new genus, Carcinus to hold this species alone (making it the type species of the genus, by monotypy). In 1847, Nardo {{described}} a distinct subspecies occurring in the Mediterranean Sea, which is now recognised as a distinct species, Carcinus aestuarii.|$|E
5|$|Václav Jan Staněk {{proposed}} a variety capillisporum in 1958, {{which has been}} sunk back into synonymy with the species. M.coliforme is the sole species in Myriostoma, making the genus monotypic. Because the original type material has <b>been</b> <b>lost,</b> <b>in</b> 1989 Sunhede suggested that Dickson's illustration in his 1776 publication (tab. III: 4a & b) {{be used as the}} lectotype.|$|E
5|$|According to Filitti, the war {{spelled out}} {{the end of}} Romania's aristocratic order, leaving the country prey to the nouveaux riches and the neo-Jacobins. As the Conservative Party itself {{collapsed}} into obscurity, he remained largely {{cut off from the}} outside world, and rejected many of the recent innovations. Reportedly, he wrote all his books and articles in dip pen, and never watched a motion picture. After 1919, he had to recover from financial ruin, having entrusted the bulk of his assets (what had not <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the war) to a broker, who gambled it away and then committed suicide.|$|E

5|$|By 1916, {{thirteen}} German light cruisers had <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> {{the course}} of World War I. To replace them, the Kaiserliche Marine ordered ten new cruisers built to a modified Königsberg class design. All ten ships were laid down in 1915 and 1916. Cöln was built by the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Bremen. Wiesbaden and Rostock were built at AG Vulcan in Stettin, and Leipzig, Ersatz Cöln, and Ersatz Emden were ordered from the AG Weser dockyard in Bremen. Dresden and Magdeburg were built at the Howaldtswerke shipyard in Kiel, while Frauenlob and Ersatz Karlsruhe were built by the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel.|$|E
5|$|Deforestation {{has also}} caused {{population}} declines for the vulnerable Yunnan and yellow-billed nuthatches. The Yunnan nuthatch can cope with some tree loss, since it prefers open pine woodland, but although still locally common, it has disappeared from {{several of the}} areas in which it was recorded in the early 20th century. The threat to yellow-billed is particularly acute on Hainan, where more than 70% of the woodland has <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the past 50 years due to shifting cultivation and the use of wood for fuel during Chinese government re-settlement programmes.|$|E
5|$|Dickens was not {{the first}} author to {{celebrate}} the Christmas season in literature. Among earlier authors who influenced Dickens was Washington Irving, whose 1819–20 work The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. included four essays on old English Christmas traditions that he experienced while staying at Aston Hall near Birmingham. The tales and essays attracted Dickens, and the two authors shared the belief that the staging of a nostalgic English Christmas might help restore the social harmony that had <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the modern world.|$|E

5|$|Doge Domenico Contarini (10431071) had a {{relatively}} uneventful reign, healing the rift between the Doge and his subjects and regaining territory that had <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> {{the east to}} the Kingdom of Croatia {{in the years following}} the deposition of Otto Orseolo. However, one fact remained: based on their actions {{in the first half of}} the 11th century, the majority of the people of Venice were clearly not in favor of having a royal hereditary class. This reality, coupled with the fresh memories of power-hungry Doges, set the stage for Domenico Selvo.|$|E
5|$|In 1451, Mehmed {{was focused}} on {{defeating}} the Karamanids and Menteşe in the East, {{but it was in}} his intentions to return to Albania. During this brief period of rest, Skanderbeg took up the rebuilding of Krujë and erected a new fortress in Modrica in the Drin Valley near Svetigrad (which had <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> a 1448 siege) where Turkish forces had previously slipped through unhindered. The fortress was constructed in the heat of summer within a few months when few Turkish posts were present. This came as a huge blow to Ottoman efforts whose Albanian operations were thus inhibited.|$|E
5|$|In Ireland, {{various forms}} of English have been spoken since the Norman invasions of the 11th century. In County Wexford, in the area {{surrounding}} Dublin, two extinct dialects known as Forth and Bargy and Fingallian developed as offshoots from Early Middle English, and were spoken until the 19th century. Modern Irish English, however {{has its roots in}} English colonisation in the 17th century. Today Irish English is divided into Ulster English, the Northern Ireland dialect with strong influence from Scots, as well as various dialects of the Republic of Ireland. Like Scottish and most North American accents, almost all Irish accents preserve the rhoticity which has <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the dialects influenced by RP.|$|E

5|$|Lhermitte then {{sailed to}} rejoin Sercey and the {{corvette}} Brûle-Gueule at Batavia in the Dutch East Indies for a planned junction with an allied Spanish squadron at Manila. This combined force then attacked an East India Company convoy {{gathering in the}} Pearl River in January 1799, but in the ensuing Macau Incident they were driven off by the Royal Navy escort squadron. Dispirited, Sercey returned westwards to Île de France, narrowly avoiding an unequal battle with a large British squadron blockading the port. On arrival he discovered that Preneuse and Brûle-Gueule were the only ships remaining of his original command, the others having returned to France or <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> battle.|$|E
5|$|Many of his {{designs were}} never {{executed}} or were subsequently demolished or altered. His competition entries for cathedrals at Lille (1854), Adelaide (1856), Colombo, Brisbane (1859), Edinburgh (1873), and Truro (1878) were all unsuccessful. He lost out to George Edmund Street {{in the competition}} for the Royal Courts of Justice (1866–67) in The Strand. His plans for the redecoration of the interior of St Paul's Cathedral (1870–77) were abandoned and he was dismissed from his post. Skilbeck's Warehouse (1865–66) was demolished in the 1970s, and work at Salisbury Cathedral (1855–59), at Worcester College, Oxford (1873–79), and at Knightshayes Court had <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the decades before.|$|E
5|$|Potassium {{levels can}} {{fluctuate}} severely during {{the treatment of}} DKA, because insulin decreases potassium levels in the blood by redistributing it into cells via increased sodium-potassium pump activity. A {{large part of the}} shifted extracellular potassium would have <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> urine because of osmotic diuresis. Hypokalemia (low blood potassium concentration) often follows treatment. This increases the risk of dangerous irregularities in the heart rate. Therefore, continuous observation of the heart rate is recommended, as well as repeated measurement of the potassium levels and addition of potassium to the intravenous fluids once levels fall below 5.3mmol/l. If potassium levels fall below 3.3mmol/l, insulin administration may need to be interrupted to allow correction of the hypokalemia.|$|E

The seventh and eighth boats were constructed by CNT at the Pola Navy Yard. Shortages of labor and materials plagued subcontractors and, consequently, the delivery dates for the boats were not met. However, the first six boats had all entered service by the middle of 1917.|$|E
