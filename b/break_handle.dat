40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that visual {{extinction}} can be reduced if two objects are positioned to afford an action. Here we tested if this affordance effect was disrupted by breaking the affordance – if one of the objects actively used in the action had a broken handle. We assessed the effects of broken affordance on recovery from extinction in eight patients with right hemisphere lesions and left-sided extinction. Patients viewed object pairs that were or were not commonly used together and that were positioned for left- or right-hand actions. In the unrelated pair conditions, either two tools or two objects were presented. In line with previous research (e. g., Riddoch et al., 2006), extinction was reduced when action-related object pairs and when unrelated tool pairs were presented compared to unrelated object pairs. There {{was no significant difference in}} recovery rate between action-related (object-tool) and unrelated tool-tool pairs. In addition, performance with action-related objects decreased when the tool appeared on the ipsilesional side compared to when it was on the contralesional side, but only when the tool handle was intact. There were minimal effects of <b>breaking</b> the <b>handle</b> of an object rather than a tool, and there was no effect of <b>breaking</b> the <b>handle</b> on either tools or objects on single item trials. The data suggest that <b>breaking</b> the <b>handle</b> of a tool lessens the degree to which it captures attention, with this attentional capture being strongest when the tool appears on the ipsilesional side. The capture of attention by the ipsilesional item then reduces the chance of detecting the contralesional stimulus. This attentional capture effect is mediated by the affordance to the intact tool...|$|R

50|$|The main {{criteria}} {{used by many}} countries and millers in rice grading are degree of milling, appearance (color), damaged (broken) and percentage of chalky kernels.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{efficient}} method for removing handles in an isosurface. Our algorithm makes an axis-aligned sweep through the volume to locate handles, compute their sizes, and selectively remove them. The algorithm {{is designed for}} out-ofcore execution.

The size of a handle is measured by a short surface loop that <b>breaks</b> it. <b>Handles</b> are removed robustly by modifying the volume rather than attempting "mesh surgery. " Finally, the volumetric modifications are spatially localized to preserve geometrical detail.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Gum Dammar is {{a natural}} {{resinous}} material of plant Shorea javanica, family–Dipterocarpaceae. In the present investigation Dammar gum (DG) and alcohol soluble fraction of Dammar gum (DA) are evaluated for their physicochemical, mechanical and film forming characteristics. Films were produced by casting/solvent evaporation method from plasticizer free and plasticizer containing solutions. Films prepared from different formulations were studied for their mechanical (tensile strength, percent elongation and Young’s modulus), water vapor transmission and moisture absorption characteristics. Unplasticized DG, DA films were brittle and posed the problem of <b>breaking</b> during <b>handling.</b> Hydrophobic plasticizers, dibutyl phthalate (DBP), improved the mechanical properties of free films with plasticizer showing significant effects on film elongation. Thus present study proposes DG and DA as excellent film formers. INTRODUCTION: Polymers are the younges...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The artisanal {{mining sector}} is largely informal, yet {{provides}} an essential livelihood for many dependants, {{as well as}} facilitating an important source for the flow of income into many communities. Artisanal mining varies from site to site, but appears largely well structured despite its informality. The artisanal mining sites in Central Africa have some inherent management structure and the extraction itself is often organised through teams of about 20 diggers who co-operate in one underground excavation. The miners are generally accompanied by supporting crews e. g. developers, timbering crews, rock transporters, rock crushers, mineral washers and waste disposal crews. Underground operations are based largely on exploiting payable pegmatite veins or mineralised material with little consideration made for mine planning issues such as mine access, rock <b>breaking,</b> material <b>handling,</b> support, ventilation or general safety considerations. Typical problems encountered in artisanal mining are poorly excavated mine accesses, which are often either unsupported or excavated to inappropriate sizes. Travelling ways promoting easy access are often lacking with material handling largely conducted by manual methods. Artisanal mining operations are largely excavated by manual labour with limited ventilation and working under conditions of limited or no illumination and are generally conducted utilising hand digging methods e. g. shovels, picks or hand chisels. This paper investigates artisanal mining in underground workings as currently applied in Central Africa and proposes best practice guidelines to uplift artisanal mining to small scale mining. Areas under investigation are mine access, pillar support, improved rock <b>breaking,</b> material <b>handling</b> and ventilation, and mining methods. This paper investigates practical methods to improve underground mining safety in the artisanal mining environment and promotes ways to improve miners’ knowledge so as to promote mining operations to migrate from labour and manual intensive methods to semi-mechanised methods. Along with improving productivity, basic mine planning principles are described promoting safer and more efficient mining methods than what are currently being applied...|$|R

During the manufacture of tablets, measures are taken to assure that they possess a suitable mechanical strength to avoid crumbling or <b>breaking</b> when <b>handling</b> while ensuring disintegration after administration. Accordingly, the tensile strength is an essential parameter to consider. In the present study, microscopic hardness and macroscopic tensile strength of binary tablets made from microcrystalline cellulose and caffeine in various proportions were measured. A relationship between these two mechanical properties was found for binary mixture. The proposed model was based on two physical measurements easily reachable: hardness and tablet density. Constants were determined from the two extreme compositions of this given system. This model was validated with experimental results, and a comparison was made with the one developed by Wu et al.

Nonetheless, with this model, the tablet tensile strength can be connected with a tablet characteristic at microscopic scale in which porosity is not needed...|$|R
