50|$|In Dec 1949, 503rd Engineer Light Equipment Company {{moved from}} Berlin to Taylor Barracks. At Taylor Barracks they were {{involved}} in German-American friendship projects such as building sports fields etc.. As the Cold War became hotter, they were increasingly sent into the French occupation zone near Kaiserslautern to build various military facilities. One of these was then called Rhein Ammunition Depot, now called Rhine Ordnance Barracks. In 1950 the French zone roads and economy were lagging far behind the British and American zones. The escalation of the Cold War mandated the French zone roads be upgraded. An Autobahn bridge near Kaiserslautern destroyed by German engineers near the war’s end made long stretches of the autobahn useless. The 503rd built a by pass road around the bridge to facilitate traffic movement on the Autobahn. In early 1951, the entire company moved from Taylor to Ettlingen, near Karlsruhe.

5000|$|The Gibson Victory was an {{electric}} guitar produced by Gibson Guitars from 1981 until 1983 (although some sources say production lasted until 1984). [...] During the late 1970s and early 1980s, musicians watched Eddie Van Halen play his Frankenstrat and questioned and rethought everything about their instruments. They insisted on engineering advances allowing more speed and playability of skyscraping leads and rock crushing shred. The master luthiers in Kalamazoo responded to these demanding guitarists by designing the Victory. The Victory, a superstrat, was {{radical departure from}} Gibson's image as an old-fashioned guitar maker. MV stood for Multi-Voice. X stood for ten They were created by the Gibson research and development team in Kalamazoo, MI, with the body work by Chuck Burge, and the multi-voice electronics by Tim Shaw. The Victory MV's were available with an optional / special order Kahler Tremolo System. The Victory MV's had a three-point top-adjust [...] "tune-o-matic" [...] bridge designed by  Rendal Wall and patent granted in June 1982. The three post holes in the underside allow {{either side of the}} <b>bridge</b> <b>unit</b> to be moved forwards or backwards for intonation of ultra light to extremely heavy string gauges, and twelve interchangeable individually-adjustable saddles, six standard nylon saddles and 6 optional brass saddles to set the fine intonation and affect tone. The Victory MV's came with a series of specially designed Humbucker Pickups carefully made one at a time on the “center focused” KZ/LP115 PAF Pickup Winder, with high sensitivity and unique tonal signature with fewer turns of wire compared to high production winding machines that produce more scatter and a wider magnetic aperture, Each pickup across the range was different, and specifically designed for the role it was assigned. The location of the Pickups were carefully calculated to provide full frequency response and minimize dead spots by avoidance of string nodal points. Humbucker pickups are inherently low noise because the interference is significantly reduced via phase cancellation, however the Victory MV’s had additional shielding connected to ground with the use of special electrically conductive black paint in the routed out area under the pickguard. Truly silent when it should be. The coil tap switch in the up position is humbucker; in the down position is single coil. Gibson had well established business agreements for over 100 years with the best wood suppliers in the world and Gibson Luthiers had first pick to craft the Victory MV's. The availability of premium old growth wood with tight grain was better in the 1980s than it is today because of new laws and limited natural resources. The Victory MV's body and tri-laminated quartersawn neck was crafted from solid eastern hard rock maple, with a Janka Hardness ranking of 1450 pound-force, a crushing strength of 7,830 pound-force per square inch , and a tensile elasticity modulus of 1,830,000 pound-force per square inch, eastern hard rock maple is extremely hard, dense, and stiff, producing earthquaking sustain. [...] The tri-laminate opposing wood grain neck design strengthened the overall neck and gave more tuning stabilization. Evidence shows that wood improves with age, the polymerization of sap over decades, once the wood is removed from the living tree crystalizes. Aged wood also loses its ability to absorb moisture, causing the wood to become more stiff and stable as it ages… the perfect recipe for a straight, high quality guitar neck, level fret board, and great sound. The Victory MV's Set-in neck [...] and silky smooth rock-hard quartersawn Madagascan ebony fret board required better tools, more time, accuracy, attention to detail, and skill to craft, but produces a warmer fuller tone and transfers resonant energy freely and immediately due to the tight permanent coupling, and facilitates ripples of vibrational energy that round out and thicken the sound, in comparison to buzzy guitars with removable screw-on necks having a metal plate and adjustment shims. The chamfered cutaway offers musicians with large hands better access to play in the top frets. The fourteen degree pitch headstock shape and tuning machine alignment allows for a perfectly straight pull on the strings and optimum string down pressure. The Gibson Victory MV's are not recommended for the weak, these sledge axes weigh a solid nine pounds but are perfectly balanced both on the strap or on the knee, Luthiers know guitars with more mass and density have more brilliance and sustain. in fact some older Gibson models weighed as much as twelve pounds. According to Gibson, Victory MV’s were only produced in Candy Apple Red, Antique Cherry Sunburst, & Twilight Blue. However sometimes a retailer who did a lot of business with Gibson would be able to ask for a small number of guitars with a special finish.

40|$|Investigation {{of natural}} {{processes}} {{is one of}} the main topics for scientists. Designing molecular systems that mimic natural processes has become important to understand the reaction pathways. Multiple artificial systems were synthesized to study intramolecular electron transfer which is triggered by pho- toexcitation. These molecules are usually comprised of an electron acceptor moiety, a photosensitizer, and/or an electron donor moiety. The donor and acceptor moiety are linked by a bridge. The molecular dyads investigated in this thesis consist of a tris(bipyridine) ruthenium(II) part which acts as the pho- tosensitizer and electron acceptor. This part is linked by different <b>bridging</b> <b>units</b> to the electron donor bis(p-anisyl) amine. Two different <b>bridging</b> <b>units</b> are presented in this thesis. Chapter 1 starts with a general introduction to photosynthesis and photoinduced electron transfer. In the third part of this chapter the reasons for choosing tris(bipyridine) ruthenium(II) as photosensitizer are discussed. Chapter 2 focuses on donor-bridge-acceptor systems with an electron-poor benzene as <b>bridging</b> <b>unit.</b> A dimesitylboron substituent is attached to the central benzene ring of the bridge. The resulting three-coordinate organoboron compound is known as sensor for small anions like CN- or F-. The ability to be bound by anions might have an influence on the charge transfer rate which we wanted to investigate. We assumed that upon fluoride attachment the energy barrier of the bridge increases. Therefore, the photoinduced electron transfer might come to a stop or there might be a change from a hopping to a tunneling mechanism. The figure below shows the two synthesized donor-bridge-acceptor systems. To increase the probability for charge transfer the bridge of dyad 2 was shortened and the photosensitizer was modified to increase its electron-withdrawing character. Chapter 3 focuses on dyads with an electron rich benzene molecule in the bridge. Therefore, 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetramethoxybenzene is placed in the middle of the <b>bridging</b> <b>unit.</b> 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetramethoxybenzene is has a low oxidation potential.

The two complexes [(OEP) Fe-O-Cu(Me(6) tren) ](1 +) and [(OEP) Fe-(OH) -Cu(Me(5) tren) (OClO 3) ](1 +) have similar structural fragments around the metal centers except that they differ significantly in the bridge structure (the former contains a linear oxo bridge while the latter has a bent hydroxo bridge). We report a comparative study of these complexes using multiple-scattering (MS) EXAFS analysis and the program package GNXAS. It is found that there is a dramatic increase in the amplitude of the Fe-X-Cu MS pathway as the <b>bridge</b> <b>unit</b> approaches linearity. Full EXAFS MS analysis enables accurate quantitation of bridge metrical details and geometry for both complexes. These studies were done with an expanded version of GNXAS, which allows for simultaneous multiple-edge fitting. Such multiple-edge analysis (using both Fe and Cu edge data) allows common pathways (in this case involving the Fe-X-Cu bridge) to be constrained to be the same, thus improving the observation/variable ratio and enhancing sensitivity for determination of the bridge structure. The accuracy of the structural determination for the bridge units is evaluated by a statistical analysis methodology in which correlations among fitting parameters are identified and contour plots are used to determine random error. The overall error in the EXAFS structural determination is found by establishing the variance with the crystallographically determined values: for the EXAFS-determined parameters at distances below 4 Angstrom, distances and angles deviated on average from crystallographic values by 0. 014 Angstrom and 1. 5 degrees, respectively. It is also established that structural features in the Fe absorption preedge are diagnostic of oxo vs hydroxo ligation.

40|$|Abstract. Biological metal {{centers that}} consist of two {{fragments}} covalently connected by one more bridging atoms or groups {{are becoming increasingly}} recognized by physicochemical properties and protein crystallography. As a class, bridged biological metal assemblies pose challenging problems in chemical synthesis; at least some are potentially subject to further structural, electronic, and reactivity characterization provided the assembly itself or a close molecular simulation thereof can be prepared. Synthetic analogue approaches to three bridged assemblies are summarized here: nitro-genase FeMoN cofactor, the catalytic site of sulfitelnitrite reductase, and the heterometal CuFe site in cytochrome c oxidase. The cofactor cluster is approached by the clusters [MFe 4 S,(PEtJ 4 L] (M = Mo, V; L = Cl', RS-), in which a cuboidal Fe,S, unit {{is linked to the}} M site by three p 2 -S atoms.

The purpose of the report is to describe the procedure of constructing a calculation template in Excel for the designing of a retaining wall, based {{on the principles of}} Lean design. The intention of making processes more efficient in order to save time and improve quality exists within most businesses. In management literature, one reappearing tool for making processes more efficient in the construction consulting industry is called Lean design. Lean design can be applied to all design and calculation processes for different types of bridges and structures. This report describes the background to Lean design and {{the process of trying to}} implement its principles in the making of a calculation template for the designing of a retaining wall. The purpose is to enable a more efficient designing process, where calculations are standardized, and the results of the process are comprehensibly presented to other actors within the consulting business, such as reviewers and CAD designers. The template is to be used for designing retaining walls in different situations depending on, for instance, construction and soil material, geometry and loads. Consequently, a major part of this report has been devoted to standardizing calculations for load effects and bearing capacity in the construction, depending on different possible settings. Designing is regulated by Eurocodes and national annexes, why it is important to refer to relevant chapters in the regulations. The regulations depend on settings and the field of application for the construction. Therefore, some generalizations of the design process have been made. However, during the process it has been clear that implementation of Lean design is one possible way of making construction design more efficient when it comes to time and quality...|$|E
40|$|In this Thesis, porphyrin-based donor-acceptor {{systems have}} been used to study {{photoinduced}} electron transfer processes. Principally, two different sets of {{systems have been}} investigated. The first is a series in which a ferrocene-fullerene donor-acceptor couple is bridged by conjugated zinc porphyrin oligomers (Fc-Pn-C 60, n = 1, 2, 4), and the second is a system containing a zinc porphyrin donor connected by a secondary electron acceptor to a gold(III) porphyrin primary acceptor. Strong inter-porphyrin conjugation in the oligomer series was achieved by using a butadiyne-link. This link allows for a broad distribution of dihedral conformations, which has important effects on the photophysical properties of the oligomers. The ground-state absorption spectrum is in effect an average of all dihedral conformations. The photophysics of the dimer was studied extensively, and {{it was found that the}} perpendicular and planar conformations can be addressed selectively. It was furthermore found that the ground-state barrier for rotation is approximately 0. 7 kcal/mol (BLYP/ 6 - 31 G(d)), whereas there is a strong bias towards the planar conformation in the excited state. Conformation is critical for the electronic coupling between the porphyrin macro-cycles and has significant effect on the electron transfer properties of these systems. By using the dimer as electron donor, considerable control over the electron transfer rate can be exercised by selective excitation of planar or perpendicular conformations. The main objective for investigating the series of conjugated porphyrin oligomers was to establish how suitable they are for use in future molecular electronic applications. This was done by photo excitation of the Pn-bridge, which results in the charge separated state Fc+-Pn-C 60  by a sequence of electron transfer steps. The subsequent charge recombination was then monitored. It was found that the oligomers mediate charge very efficiently at distances up to 65 Å for n = 4 with remarkably weak distance dependence. The conformational flexibility of these systems has important implications for the mediation of electronic coupling, as this is expected to be a strong function of porphyrin-porphyrin dihedral angle. It was found that the charge recombination rate increased by an order of magnitude when Fc-P 2 -C 60 was constrained to a planar conformation by the addition of a bi dentate ligand. Further, as a part of this study, the triplet energies of the oligomers were determined. In the second set of donor-acceptor systems, two electron transfer processes are viable: a direct, long-range electron transfer, and a sequential electron transfer. High solvent polarity stabilises an intermediary state, where the electron is localised on the anthracene-based <b>bridge</b> <b>unit,</b> which thus serves as a secondary electron acceptor. It is shown in this work that the two mechanisms operate in parallel, and moreover, that the direct electron transfer is faster than the sequential mechanism by approximately a factor of two, at room temperature. As the temperature dependence of the sequential mechanism is stronger than that of the direct mechanism, temperature served as an important means to control the competition. In butyronitrile, the sequential mechanism was essentially switched off relative to the direct electron transfer at low temperatures...|$|E

50|$|The {{campaign}} was brought forward by {{one day to}} 20 September. The change of schedule caused the JNA 1st Guards Mechanised Division to commit to battle as it arrived in eastern Slavonia with no reconnaissance or preparation. The resulting traffic jam on the Šid - Tovarnik - Stari Jankovci road prevented <b>bridging</b> <b>units</b> from reaching the Bosut River. That in turn prevented the 1st Guards Division from crossing the river and confined it to the area between the Bosut and the Danube, east of Vinkovci. Besides the <b>bridging</b> <b>units,</b> the division did not receive the 80th Motorised Brigadewhich appears to have disintegrated before reaching the Croatian frontierand the 2nd Guards Mechanised Brigade - a victim of friendly fire bombardment in the area between Tovarnik and Ilača adjacent to the border. Several units of the Novi Sad Corps also disintegrated when morale declined {{after a number of}} friendly fire incidents.|$|R
50|$|Prestressing is a {{technique}} of introducing stresses into a structural member during fabrication and/or construction to improve its strength and performance. This technique is often employed in concrete beams, columns, spandrels, single and double tees, wall panels, segmental <b>bridge</b> <b>units,</b> bulb-tee girders, I-beam girders, and others. Many projects find that prestressed concrete provides the lowest overall cost, considering production and lifetime maintenance.|$|R
