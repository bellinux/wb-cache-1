Nowadays, Address <b>Book</b> <b>Matching,</b> a new feature that helps people {{keep in touch}} with real world contacts, has been loaded in many popular messenger applications, which unfortunately as well brings severe privacy issues to users. In this paper, we propose a novel method to abuse such feature to automatically collect user profiles. This method can be applied to any application equipped with Address <b>Book</b> <b>Matching</b> independent of mobile platforms. We also build a prototype on Android to verify the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we integrate profiles gathered from different messenger applications and provide insights by performing a consistency and authenticity analysis on user profile fields. As our experiments show, the abuse of Address <b>Book</b> <b>Matching</b> can cause severe user privacy leakage. Finally, we provide some countermeasures for developers to avoid this issue when designing messenger applications. © 2013 ACM.

Clinical bibliotherapy usually involves trained mental health or healthcare pracititioners using books as a way to stimulate discussion of difficult feelings or facilitate resolution of more significant behavioral and emotional issues. It is seldom used alone, but more typically in combination with discussion or other follow-up activities that promote the psychological processes of identification, catharsis and insight...|$|E
