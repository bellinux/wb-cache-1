5|$|By {{the early}} 20thcentury, major river-control {{projects}} had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place. Levees were constructed {{along the river}} in most urban areas, and Portland built concrete walls to protect its downtown sector. In the following decades, many large dams were built on Cascade Range tributaries of the Willamette. The Army Corps of Engineers operates 13 such dams, which affect flows from about 40percent of the basin. Most {{of them do not}} have fish ladders.|$|E
5|$|Cagney became {{president}} of the Screen Actors Guild in 1942 for a two-year term. He took a role in the Guild's fight against the Mafia, which had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> an active interest in the movie industry. His wife, Billie Vernon, once received a phone call telling her that Cagney was dead. Cagney alleged that, having failed to scare off the Guild and him, they sent a hitman to kill him by dropping a heavy light onto his head. Upon hearing of the rumor of a hit, George Raft made a call, and the hit was supposedly canceled.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the family}} have all <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> extra jobs {{to pay for}} Chris's tuition; Peter sells butt scratchers at the ballpark, Lois and Meg begin working as prostitutes, and Stewie decides to follow {{overweight}} park-goers, while playing the tuba, making them fall. As this is happening, Chris starts to feel uncomfortable with his membership at the Skull and Bones, especially after one of their activities involves teasing an orphan they had pretended to adopt. Feeling his family should not go through so much trouble to keep him satisfied, Chris asks Carter {{to help him get}} back into his old school. Carter complies with his request, and Chris moves back home, and returns to James Woods High School. At the end of the episode, Stewie plays the tuba for Chris, making him fall.|$|E

5|$|Toy spaniels {{continued}} to be popular in the British court {{during the reign of}} King James II, through that of Queen Anne. Popular types included those of the white and red variety. Following the Glorious Revolution in 1688 and the reign of King William III and Queen Mary II, the Pug was introduced into Britain which would eventually lead to drastic physical changes to the King Charles Spaniel. Comparisons between needlework pictures of English toy spaniels and the continental variety show that changes had already <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place in the English types by 1736, with a shorter nose being featured and the breed overall moving away from the one seen in earlier works by Anthony van Dyck during the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|When the Kindred escort {{the agents}} {{out of the}} village, Mulder {{comments}} {{on the lack of}} children in the community and states that he recognizes some of the faces from photographs taken in the 1930s. Curious, he returns to the village that night, and hears chanting as a procession of the Kindred moves to a barn. Scully is led off by Brother Andrew, who claims {{to be able to give}} her information about the murderer, whom he calls Brother Martin. Downstairs in the barn, the group can be seen bathing Brother Aaron's body in watery clay. Mulder hides in a crevice, where he discovers that the sick man has been buried alive and has <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on feminine features. Meanwhile, Brother Andrew uses his power to seduce Scully. She is unable to resist, and is on the verge of succumbing before Mulder comes to her aid. The agents are again escorted out of the village.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Australians were {{detected}} while waiting to step off and, after being illuminated by flares and taking fire from a German picquet, hastily launched the attack. After overcoming this, the left-centre company, having lost {{all of their}} officers, lost their formation {{and had to be}} re-organised before the attack on {{the eastern side of the}} village could continue. The two companies passed through hedges and the ruined buildings, clearing the outskirts of the village with little resistance. The left-most company then began its task of establishing outposts to the east. At the same time, on the right, the right-most company had advanced to the Doignes–Hermies road when they had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> fire. Overcoming this and skirting a wire obstacle, they began moving towards the rear of the German main defence line. At this point, they came under fire from a low hill on the western outskirts of the village, which took them in the flank and pinned them on its slope. In the darkness, the location of the enemy machine-gun could not be ascertained initially. The Australians remained fixed there for almost an hour-and-a-half before members of the right centre company, who had avoided most of the German resistance, were able to locate it and destroy it from the rear just before dawn. The two centre companies were then able to enter the village proper, forcing large numbers of the garrison to try to escape to the north-east, where they were taken prisoner in large numbers. Here the left-most company had been establishing a number of posts in the open fields. Most of these were established with minimal resistance, however, one platoon became heavily engaged by a machine-gun positioned near a sandpit on the other side of a road. A small group of men crossed the road and attempted to provide covering fire for the platoon. Amongst this group was Private Bede Kenny who, under heavy fire, rushed the enemy position and destroyed it with grenades, taking the surviving Germans prisoner. For his actions, he was later awarded the Victoria Cross. Minor skirmishing continued after this, but by 6:00am the village had been captured and 200 prisoners taken, for a loss to the 2nd Battalion of eight officers and 173 other ranks killed or wounded.|$|E

25|$|Many {{theories}} exist {{regarding the}} origin of wéiqí in Chinese history.

25|$|Christianity has a {{long history}} in Congo, dating back to 1484, when the Portuguese arrived and {{convinced}} the king and entourage of the Kongo people to convert.

Alfonso (the Kongo royal family had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on Portuguese names), established relations with the Vatican. More widespread conversion occurred during the Belgian colonial era. Christianity varies in its forms, and is in some ways surprisingly similar to native beliefs.|$|E

25|$|The {{current crisis}} has {{its origins in}} the Fiji coup of 2000. The 2000 coup was aimed at the {{multi-ethnic}} Government led by Mahendra Chaudhry. The proponents of the coup were an armed faction not {{closely associated with the}} military, who opposed their actions. After Bainimarama declared martial law and resolved the crisis by force, an interim government was sworn in, headed by current prime minister Laisenia Qarase. The Prime Minister was democratically elected in elections in 2001 and 2006, and has since <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> actions that have provoked the displeasure of the military.|$|E
25|$|The Hark-1 Teams now {{operated}} in three zones. The southernmost of these sectors centered on Tchepone, but extended southward to Cambodia. The central section of Hark-1 Teams targeted the Mụ Giạ Pass area; during 1967, 15 teams operated there, with two rotating station within the pass itself. The third Hark-1 zone was Nape Pass. By contrast with American reconnaissance teams, the Lao often unobtrusively hiked long distances into their operational area {{instead of being}} inserted by helicopter. Nor were the Lao limited to team service; by now, they had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over recruit training from the Thais.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, {{the central}} {{government}} revised the law on the control of infectious diseases in March 2004. The revision provides instructions to tackle infectious-disease outbreaks, improve the reporting of infectious diseases, implement interventions to control the spread of such diseases, provide clinical services, and fund the control of infectious diseases. This law directly benefited tuberculosis control by addressing the under-reporting of tuberculosis by health facilities. Tuberculosis now has to be reported to local public-health authorities within 24 hours. Because failure to report is now a crime, hospitals have <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the reporting of tuberculosis very seriously.|$|E

An autopsy found no other recreational drugs in Bonham's body, {{in keeping with his}} recent abstention from heroin, which he had used intermittently for several years; although he had recently <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Motival (a cocktail of the antipsychotic fluphenazine and the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline) to combat his anxiety, it is unclear if these substances interacted with the alcohol in his system.

25|$|American poetry, {{the poetry}} of the United States, arose first as efforts by colonists to add their voices to English poetry in the 17th century, well before the {{constitutional}} unification of the thirteen colonies (although before this unification, a strong oral tradition often likened to poetry existed among Native American societies). Unsurprisingly, most of the early colonists' work relied on contemporary British models of poetic form, diction, and theme. However, in the 19th century, a distinctive American idiom began to emerge. By the later part of that century, when Walt Whitman was winning an enthusiastic audience abroad, poets from the United States had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> their place {{at the forefront of}} the English-language avant-garde.|$|E
