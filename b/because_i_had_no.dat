2500|$|Occam's razor {{may also}} be {{recognized}} in the apocryphal story about an exchange between Pierre-Simon Laplace and Napoleon. It is said that in praising Laplace {{for one of his}} recent publications, the emperor asked how it was that the name of God, which featured so frequently in the writings of Lagrange, appeared nowhere in Laplace's. At that, he is said to have replied, [...] "It's <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> need of that hypothesis." [...] Though some point to this story as illustrating Laplace's atheism, more careful consideration suggests that he may instead have intended merely to illustrate the power of methodological naturalism, or even simply that the fewer logical premises one assumes, the stronger is one's conclusion.|$|E
2500|$|The Whitlams {{recorded}} {{their third}} album, Eternal Nightcap, with Freedman and Taylor co-producing. Freedman [...] "chose musicians to fit each song, {{rather than have}} the same band through the whole album." [...] The album was recorded on an extremely limited budget of $18,000. In a later interview Freedman reflects [...] "The band became a revolving door <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> money to pay anyone. I actually made the album, Eternal Nightcap, during that most difficult period, that was a really tough year in which to keep my focus and keep my head up, but it ended in September 1997 when I put the record out and it just started selling itself." [...] Jonathan Lewis of AllMusic described it as being [...] " [...] full of gentle, well-crafted, piano-driven pop songs." [...] Singles from the album include [...] "You Sound Like Louis Burdett" [...] (May 1997), [...] "Melbourne" [...] (January 1998) and [...] "No Aphrodisiac" [...] (February).|$|E
2500|$|Iñárritu {{contacted}} {{friend and}} jazz drummer Antonio Sánchez in January 2013, inviting him to compose the {{score for the}} film. His reaction to writing a soundtrack using only drums was similar to Lubezki's thoughts of shooting the movie like a single shot: [...] "It was a scary proposition <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> point of reference of how to achieve this. There's no other movie I know that has a score like this." [...] Sánchez had also not worked on a film before, nevertheless, after receiving the script, he composed [...] "rhythmic themes" [...] {{for each of the}} characters. Iñárritu was looking for the opposite approach however, preferring spontaneity and improvisation. Sánchez then waited until production moved to New York before composing more, where he visited the set {{for a couple of days}} to get a better idea of the film. Following this, a week before principal photography, he and Iñárritu went to a studio to record some demos. During these sessions the director would first talk him through the scene, then while Sánchez was improvising guide him by raising his hand to indicate an event such as a character opening a door or by describing the rhythm with verbal sounds. They recorded around seventy demos, which Iñárritu used to inform the pacing of the scenes on set, and once filming was complete, spliced them into the rough cut. Sánchez summarized the process by saying [...] "The movie fed on the drums and the drums fed on the imagery." [...] The official soundtrack was released as a CD (77 min) in October 2014, and as an LP (69 min) in April 2015.|$|E

6000|$|... "I did not move. It {{looked up}} at me and wagged its tail. Then it drew back--I suppose <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> words for it. I watched it run {{half-round}} the room and stop and look at me again. Then it slunk out.|$|E

6000|$|... "Did they though?" [...] said Richard. [...] "Oh!

6000|$|... "I walked, sir, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> money; but I {{assure you}} I {{did not mean}} to be insolent.

6000|$|Mrs. March {{said that}} if I wished to tease it was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> ideas on the subject, and she would advise me to drop it.

5000|$|... "This Will is {{necessarily}} uncommon and capricious <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> dependents or near relations and no duty rests upon {{me to leave}} any property at my death and what I do leave is proof of my folly in gathering and retaining more than I required in my lifetime." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “You will understand, Pita, that {{in paying}} you and Hurka only {{the balance of}} wages agreed on, <b>I</b> do so <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> more money with me than is needed to carry me home; it in no way {{represents}} the deep obligation which I feel towards you both.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{said that}} this was almost the dearest and most {{beautiful}} thing. The very dearest and most beautiful is this--God means something to me now. He means so much!

60|$|This {{put me in}} mind of {{the life}} I lived in my kingdom the island, where I {{suffered}} no more corn to grow, because I did not want it; and bred no more goats, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> more use for them; where the money lay in the drawer till it grew mildewed, and had scarce the favour to be looked upon in twenty years.|$|E

60|$|Livy, darling, {{everybody}} says lecture-lecture-lecture--but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{not the least}} idea of doing it--certainly not at present.
