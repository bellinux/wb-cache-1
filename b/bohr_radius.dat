25|$|Thus Bohr's {{assumption}} that angular momentum is quantised means that an electron can only inhabit certain orbits around the nucleus, {{and that it}} can have only certain energies.

25|$|For example, the lithium atom has two {{electrons}} {{in the lowest}} 1s orbit, and these orbit at Z=2. Each one sees the nuclear charge of Z=3 minus the screening effect of the other, which crudely reduces the nuclear charge by 1 unit. This means that the innermost electrons orbit at approximately 1/4 the <b>Bohr</b> <b>radius.</b> The outermost electron in lithium orbits at roughly Z=1, since the two inner electrons reduce the nuclear charge by 2. This outer electron should be at nearly one <b>Bohr</b> <b>radius</b> from the nucleus. Because the electrons strongly repel each other, the effective charge description is very approximate; the effective charge Z doesn't usually come {{out to be an}} integer. But Moseley's law experimentally probes the innermost pair of electrons, and shows that they do see a nuclear charge of approximately Z−1, while the outermost electron in an atom or ion with only one electron in the outermost shell orbits a core with effective charge Z−k where k is the total number of {{electrons in}} the inner shells.|$|E

40|$|Elastic {{scattering}} of positronium atoms by hydrogen atoms below the excitation threshold at 5. 1 eV is investigated {{with the investigation}} limited to the spin-zero (singlet) state of the two electrons. Nonresonant S-wave phase shifts have been obtained from normalizable trial functions by extracting the center-of-mass wave function and examining its spatial behavior. An effective-range expansion is fitted to the phase shifts and the previously obtained positronium-hydride bound-state energy to yield a scattering length approximately equal to 5. 3 <b>Bohr</b> <b>radii</b> as compared with Fraser's (1961) corrected exchange result of 7. 28 <b>Bohr</b> <b>radii.</b> The stabilization method suggests that a resonance occurs at a scattering energy of 4. 5 eV, about 0. 6 eV below the excitation threshold.

2500|$|A {{positive}} muon, when {{stopped in}} ordinary matter, cannot {{be captured by}} a proton since it {{would need to be}} an antiproton. The positive muon is also not attracted to the nucleus of atoms. Instead, it binds a random electron and with this electron forms an exotic atom known as muonium (Mu) atom. In this atom, the muon acts as the nucleus. The positive muon, in this context, can be considered a pseudo-isotope of hydrogen with one ninth of the mass of the proton. Because the reduced mass of muonium, and hence its <b>Bohr</b> <b>radius,</b> is very close to that of hydrogen, this short-lived [...] "atom" [...] (or a muon and electron) behaves chemically — to a first approximation — like the isotopes of hydrogen (protium, deuterium [...] and tritium).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive {{perspective of the}} metric of quantum states {{with a focus on}} the background independent metric structures. We also explore the possibilities of geometrical formulations of quantum mechanics beyond the quantum state space and Kahler manifold. The metric of quantum states in the classical configuration space with the pseudo-Riemannian signature and its possible applications are explored. On contrary to the common perception that a metric for quantum state can yield a natural metric in the configuration space with the limit when Planck constant vanishes, we obtain the metric of quantum states in the configuration space without imposing this limiting condition. Here, Planck constant is absorbed in the quantity like <b>Bohr</b> <b>radii.</b> While exploring the metric structure associated with Hydrogen like atom, we witness another interesting finding that the invariant lengths appear in the multiple of <b>Bohr</b> <b>radii.</b> Comment: 25 Pages;journal reference added:Published in- Int.

2500|$|De Broglie {{expanded}} the Bohr {{model of the}} atom by showing that an electron in orbit around a nucleus could {{be thought of as}} having wave-like properties. In particular, an electron will be observed only in situations that permit a standing wave around a nucleus. An example of a standing wave is a violin string, which is fixed at both ends and can be made to vibrate. The waves created by a stringed instrument appear to oscillate in place, moving from crest to trough in an up-and-down motion. The wavelength of a standing wave is related to the length of the vibrating object and the boundary conditions. For example, because the violin string is fixed at both ends, it can carry standing waves of wavelengths 2l/n, where l is the length and n is a positive integer. [...] De Broglie suggested that the allowed electron orbits were those for which the circumference of the orbit would be an integer number of wavelengths. The electron's wavelength therefore determines that only Bohr orbits of certain distances from the nucleus are possible. In turn, at any distance from the nucleus smaller than a certain value {{it would be impossible to}} establish an orbit. The minimum possible distance from the nucleus is called the <b>Bohr</b> <b>radius.</b>|$|E
