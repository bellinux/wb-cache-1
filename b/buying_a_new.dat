5|$|In a {{departure}} {{from one of the}} F-16's original raison d'etre recent costs for both new and refurbished aircraft have risen significantly from its 1998 fly-away cost of $18.8 million. In 2011, Iraq ordered 18 F-16IQ (Block 52) for $3 billion, an average cost of $165 million per unit. In 2014, the United Arab Emirates ordered 30 F-16s Block 60 aircraft with the average cost of $200 million. In 2017, Romania purchased 12 refurbished used F-16A/Bs from Portugal for a total of €628 million, roughly $680 million, an average cost of $56 million. This cost led the Polish deputy minister for national defence Bartosz Kownacki to counsel against buying used F-16s, saying that <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> F-35 would be better value. In March 2017, the US government released plans to sell 19 new F-16s with 23 engines, radars, and armament to Bahrain for total cost of $4.867 billion.|$|E

25|$|In July 2017, the Austria Defense Ministry {{announced}} that it would be replacing all of its Typhoon aircraft by 2020. The ministry said that continued use of its Typhoons over their 30-year life–span would cost about €5 billion with the bulk being for maintenance. It estimated that <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> fleet of 15 single–seat and 3 twin–seat fighters would save €2 billion over that period. Austria plans to explore a government-to-government sale or lease agreement to avoid a lengthy and costly tender process with a manufacturer. Possible replacements include the Saab Gripen and the F-16.|$|E
25|$|However, {{one of the}} {{sticking}} points was {{the lack}} of reliability from the railmotor fleet; by mid 1982 none of the DRC railcars were in good condition, and the DERM fleet was only achieving 38% availability; this required 'scratch' sets of between 2 and 4 older wooden carriages hauled by locomotives as replacements. VicRail looked into the costs of <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> fleet of railmotors and found the cost for a 2-carriage airconditioned railmotor to be in the range of $1.6-2.5million each. An alternative, cheaper proposal was to rebuild the DRC's electrical systems, and to replace other railmotor rosters with T class locomotives and refurbished Harris carriages. The proposed consist at the time was H-H-T-H-H, with the outer H carriages fitted with driving controls and all cars fitted with multiple-unit cabling.|$|E
25|$|During the 1991 close season, Ferguson's {{assistant}} Archie Knox departed to Rangers {{to become}} assistant to Walter Smith, and Ferguson promoted youth team coach Brian Kidd {{to the role}} of assistant manager in Knox's place. He also made two major signings – goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel and defender Paul Parker – to bolster his side. There was much anticipation about the breakthrough of the young Ryan Giggs, who had played twice and scored once in the 1990–91 campaign, and the earlier emergence of another impressive young winger in the shape of Lee Sharpe, who despite their youth had made Ferguson feel able to resist plunging into the transfer market and <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> player to take over from the disappointing Danny Wallace on the left wing. He had also added the Ukrainian Andrei Kanchelskis to the right wing, giving him a more attacking alternative to older midfielders Mike Phelan and Bryan Robson.|$|E

500|$|In the 1990s CSG {{introduced}} the ACSR (Advanced Customer Service Representative) system. An extension to ACSR called ProfitNow! {{was introduced in}} 2003. ProfitNow! used a consumer's account data to advise customer service representatives on {{the likelihood of a}} caller cancelling their service or <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> product. It was later turned into an online system with a user interface similar to Microsoft Windows at CSG.net. CSG purchased the Kenan FX software from Lucent Technologies in 2002. Kenan software managed billing and ordering and provided middle-ware to help various customer service and billing products integrate with each other. CSG NextGen was introduced for international markets, with support for multiple languages. In March 2014, CSG added a cybersecurity suite to its product portfolio, under the name CSG Invotas. The company released CSG Ascendon, a digital platform for communications service providers, in March 2015. The platform uses content monetization and delivery systems without making excessive changes to existing infrastructure. In November 2015 the Invotas unit was spun off into a separate entity. [...] Invotas was acquired by FireEye in a transaction that closed February 1, 2016.|$|E

He visited whalers wintering at Herschel Island on March 15, 1908. He left the whalers on March 21, and returned to Dawson City via Rampart House, Yukon Territory. It was on this trip that Wada, running short of dog food, reportedly fed the animals his sealskin pants. [...] "Fortunately," [...] he said, [...] "the spring days were so warm that I did not suffer so keenly as such a sacrifice would have entailed in winter."

2500|$|While {{reviewing}} the secret footage, Stacy and Clinton would comment, in sometimes caustic style, {{on why the}} nominee's wardrobe was unflattering ("mom jeans") or out-dated (purchased in the 1980s) and they would usually meet with the nominators before meeting the nominee. Afterward, the entire group would go to meet the soon-to-be-surprised nominee. During the surprise visit, the nominee was offered a $5,000 Visa debit card (in later seasons, the card was an unbranded $5,000 gift card) {{for the purpose of}} <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> wardrobe if she would turn over her entire existing wardrobe to Stacy and Clinton and shop by their [...] "rules" [...] (shopping guidelines tailored for her age, body shape, and profession). If the nominee accepted the terms of the offer then Stacy and Clinton would give them the gift card and review the secret footage with them. If she declined, nothing further is filmed and there is no show. Nominees were sometimes very reluctant to agree and had to be persuaded by Stacy and Clinton and the nominators.|$|E
2500|$|While {{agreement}} {{is the basis}} for all contracts, not all agreements are enforceable. A preliminary question is whether the contract is reasonably certain in its essential terms, or essentialia negotii, such as price, subject matter and the identity of the parties. Generally the courts endeavour to [...] "make the agreement work", so in Hillas & Co Ltd v Arcos Ltd, the House of Lords held that an option to buy softwood of [...] "fair specification" [...] was sufficiently certain to be enforced, when read in the context of previous agreements between the parties. However the courts do not wish to [...] "make contracts for people", and so in Scammell and Nephew Ltd v Ouston, a clause stipulating the price of <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> van as [...] "on hire purchase terms" [...] for two years was held unenforceable because there was no objective standard by which the court could know what price was intended or what a reasonable price might be. Similarly, in Baird Textile Holdings Ltd v M plc the Court of Appeal held that because the price and quantity to buy would be uncertain, in part, no term could be implied for M to give reasonable notice before terminating its purchasing agreement. Controversially, the House of Lords extended this idea by holding an agreement to negotiate towards a future contract in good faith is insufficiently certain to be enforceable.|$|E
