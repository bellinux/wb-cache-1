50|$|Most of {{the cars}} {{carrying}} the dirt spoils were wooden flat cars lined with steel floors that used a crude but effective unloading device, the Lidgerwood system. The railroad cars had only one side, and steel aprons bridged the spaces between them. The rock and dirt were first <b>blasted</b> loose <b>by</b> <b>explosives.</b> Two sets of tracks were then built or moved up to where the loosened material lay. The steam shovels, moving on one set of tracks, picked up the loosened dirt and piled it on the flat cars traveling on a parallel set of tracks. The dirt was piled high up against the one closed side of the car. The train moved forward until all cars were filled. A typical train had 20 dirt cars arranged as essentially one long car.|$|R
5000|$|The Misznay-Schardin effect (alternative {{spelling}} Misnay-Schardin), or platter effect, is {{a characteristic}} of the detonation of a broad sheet of explosive. The explosive blast expands directly away from, perpendicular to, the surface of an explosive. Unlike the blast from a rounded explosive charge, which expands in all directions, the <b>blast</b> produced <b>by</b> an <b>explosive</b> sheet expands primarily perpendicular to its plane, in both directions. However, if one side is backed by a heavy or fixed mass, most of the blast (that is, most of the rapidly expanding gas and its kinetic energy) will be sent in the direction away from the mass.|$|R

50|$|Starting {{six months}} before the {{invasion}} of Afghanistan by the USSR on 27 December 1979, the Afghan Mujahideen were supplied with large quantities of military supplies. Among those supplies were many types of anti-tank mines. The insurgents often removed the explosives from several foreign anti-tank mines, and combined the explosives in tin cooking-oil cans for a more powerful <b>blast.</b> <b>By</b> combining the <b>explosives</b> from several mines and placing them in tin cans, the insurgents made them more powerful, but sometimes also easier to detect by Soviet sappers using mine detectors. After an IED was detonated, the insurgents often used direct-fire weapons such as machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades to continue the attack.|$|R
40|$|Recently {{there has}} been {{interest}} in determining {{what happens to the}} human brain during a traumatic brain injury (TBI). The <b>blast</b> wave created <b>by</b> <b>explosive</b> devices, such as landmines, {{is one of the most}} common causes of TBI. The purpose of this study is to investigate the link between an explosion and a cells reaction to a blast wave on a time scale of a few hours. Three different types of cells were tested by pressure waves exposure, fibroblasts (3 T 3), epithelial cervical cancer (HeLa), and canine epithelial kidney cells (MDCK). Fluorescent images of the cells before and after pressure wave exposure were used to determine how much damage cells have suffered. 3 T 3 cells showed the most cellular modification while HeLa and MDCK were more resilient. A simple scaling model is proposed to relate the cellular modification to the shock strength...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objectives}} in blasting taconite are to produce broken rock that permits optimum digging and shovel loading rates with minimum secondary breakage and eliminates primary crusher delays. Since at least 1990, {{much of the}} <b>blasting</b> research <b>by</b> <b>explosives</b> companies, academics, and mining companies has been directed toward determining the downstream benefits of increased blast energy, particularly on crushing and coarse grinding. Several papers have been published that attempt {{to quantify the cost}} benefits. However, so many variables are involved that most benefits are only indicated or estimated. A report entitled "Effects of <b>Blasting</b> on Milling," <b>by</b> C. M. Lownds and D. A. Bocca of Viking Explosives & Supply, Inc., and K. Nielsen, Professor, Department of Geology and Mineral Resources Engineering, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, was presented at the 1997 Duluth, Minnesota, SME Annual Meeting. It describes a rather simple method of explosively loading taconite samples and of evaluating the explosive effects on grindability. 1 " The small-scale explosive tests were conducted on taconite rock pieces collected from the back of a muckpile instead of on diamond drill core or sawed and drilled cubes, as described in previous work. 2 · 3 The testwork described in the following report was proposed as a continuation of the tests on rock fragments to examine more extensively the effects of small-scale explosive tests on rock weakening.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experimental study is to compare the effects of various materials obstructing the flow of a blast wave {{and the ability of}} the given material to reduce the damage caused <b>by</b> the <b>blast.</b> Several methods of energy transfer in blast wave flows are known or expected including: material interfaces with impedance mismatches, density changes in a given material, internal shearing, and particle fracture. The theory applied to this research is that the greatest energy transfer within the obstructing material will yield the greatest mitigation effects to the blast. Sample configurations of foam were varied to introduce material interfaces and filler materials with varying densities and impedances (liquids and powders). The samples were loaded according to a small scale <b>blast</b> produced <b>by</b> an <b>explosive</b> driven shock tube housing gram-range charges. The transmitted blast profiles were analyzed for variations in impulse characteristics and frequency components as compared to standard free field profiles. The results showed a rounding effect of the transmitted blast profile for all samples with the effects of the low density fillers surpassing all others tested. United States.

40|$|AbstractIn this contribution, field {{experiments}} {{of dynamic}} fracture by electric discharge impulses (EDI) are performed and fracture development in rectangular concrete blocks with reinforcing steels bars is analyzed also numerically in the three-dimensional context. It is {{found that the}} development of fracture network depends very sensitively on the geometrical settings (e. g. positions of empty dummy holes prepared for controlling crack propagation directions) in the blocks, and cracks extending from blast holes may tend to arrest on the (pre-) existing planes of weakness (e. g. interfaces between concrete material and reinforcing steel bars). This characteristic can be used to actualize more efficient and precise disintegration of a given structure, for instance, removal of reinforced concrete (RC) lining segments from the surroundings in an underground space. Optimal positions of blast and empty dummy holes for predictable and controlled dynamic destruction may be determined for each specific structure by the established simulation technique, which is effective for both conventional and modern dynamic disintegration methodologies, namely, fragmentation <b>by</b> <b>blasting</b> using <b>explosives</b> as well as by EDI...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary {{injuries}} {{are a major}} source of morbidity and mortality associated with trauma. Trauma includes injuries associated with accidents and falls as well as <b>blast</b> injuries caused <b>by</b> <b>explosives.</b> The prevalence and mortality of these injuries has made research of pulmonary injury a major priority. Lungs have a complex structure, with multiple types of tissues necessary to allow successful respiration. The soft, porous parenchyma is the component of the lung which contains the alveoli responsible for gas exchange. Parenchyma is also the portion which is most susceptible to traumatic injury. Finite element simulations are an important tool for studying traumatic injury to the human body. These simulations rely on material properties to accurately recreate real world mechanical behaviors. Previous studies have explored the mechanical properties of lung tissues, specifically parenchyma. These studies have assumed material isotropy but, to our knowledge, no study has thoroughly tested and quantified this assumption. This study presents a novel methodology for assessing isotropy in a tissue, and applies these methods to porcine lung parenchyma. Briefly, lung parenchyma samples were dissected so as to be aligned with one of the three anatomical planes, sagittal, frontal, and transverse, and then subjected to compressive mechanical testing. Stress-strain curves from these tests were statistically compared by a novel method for differences in stresses and strains at percentages of the curve. Histological samples aligned with the anatomical planes were also examined by qualitative and quantitative methods to determine any differences in the microstructural morphology. Our study showed significant evidence to support the hypothesis that lung parenchyma behaves isotropically...|$|R
