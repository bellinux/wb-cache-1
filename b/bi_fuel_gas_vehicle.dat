LNG competes directly with compressed natural <b>gas</b> as a <b>fuel</b> for natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicles</b> since the engine is identical. There may be applications where LNG trucks, buses, trains and boats could be cost effective in order to regularly distribute LNG energy together with general freight and/or passengers to smaller, isolated communities without a local gas source or access to pipelines.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} key {{results of}} the analysis of different transport modes of hydro-methane, methanol, carbon dioxide and oxygen in Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina. Hydro-methane is produced in Paraguay {{and can be used}} to <b>fuel</b> natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicles,</b> substituting gasoline and diesel which are at the moment imported from foreign countries. Methanol, also produced in Paraguay, is delivered to Brazil, {{which is one of the}} Countries with the highest demand in the region. Oxygen can be sold to Argentina for medical and industrial use. Carbon dioxide is delivered throughout Paraguay. The aim of this study is to determine the best transportation technology from an economic and strategic point of view, minimizing costs associated to products distribution. Several scenarios are investigated; each scenario is associated with different delivery modes. A model is developed to estimate both capital and variable costs for different transportation technologies (pipeline, trucks, ships) in order to choose the lowest-cost delivery mode for each product, depending on distances and flow rates. Four different analysis are performed for each scenario, varying the number of vehicles which must be fueled by hydro-methane and considering its influence on the results. The methodology presented here has a general value, thus it can be easily employed for the economic analysis of different fuels and distribution networks, also placed in different scenarios. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|While {{natural gas}} is often used as the energy source for residential, commercial, and {{industrial}} processes, engines designed to run on gasoline or diesel can also be modified to operate on natural gas ― a clean burning <b>fuel.</b> Natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicles</b> (NGVs) can be dedicated to natural <b>gas</b> as a <b>fuel</b> source, or they can be bi-fuel, running on either natural gas or gasoline, or natural gas or diesel, although most natural gas engines are spark ignited. Natural gas engine technologies can differ in the following ways: the method used to ignite the fuel in the cylinders, the air-fuel ratio, the compression ratio, and the resulting performance and emissions capabilities. Natural gas has a high octane rating, which in spark ignition engines (usual for CNG) allows an increase in power. However, natural gas occupies a larger volume in the cylinder than liquid fuels, {{reducing the number of}} oxygen molecules (share of air in the cylinder), which reduces power. The net effect on natural gas power vs. gasoline is relatively neutral. However, since it is a gaseous fuel at atmospheric pressure and occupies a considerably larger storage volume per unit of energy than refined petroleum liquids, it is stored on-board the vehicle in either a compressed gaseous or liquefied state. The storage requirements are still much greater than for refined petroleum products. This increases vehicle weight, which tends to reduce fuel economy. To becom...|$|R
40|$|Motor {{vehicles}} generate {{three major}} pollutants: Hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and carbon monoxide (CO). Hydrocarbon reacts with nitrogen oxides {{in the presence}} of sunlight to form ground-level ozone (smog). Nitrogen oxides contributes to the formation of acid rain while carbon monoxide can impair mental functions and is deadly in high concentrations. Statistics in Malaysia show that from 8. 9 million motor vehicles registered in 1998, approximately 2 millions tones of carbon monoxide, 237 000 tonnes of oxides of nitrogen, 111 000 tonnes of hydrocarbons, 38 000 tonnes sulphur dioxide and 17 000 tonnes particulate matters were emitted into the atmosphere. Concurrent with the increasing awareness of the impact of vehicular emissions on the global environmental quality, the industry concerned has invented many new technologies on reducing the emission level. These include catalytic converters, reformulated <b>fuels</b> and natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Malaysia is promoting the use of cleaner <b>fuel</b> (natural <b>gas)</b> in power <b>vehicle.</b> Combustion from natural gas produces cleaner emissions, and thus providing the inhabitants of city centers a cleaner environment.
