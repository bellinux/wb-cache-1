50|$|Having had enough, Sam <b>breaks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{the second}} floor and finds Agung {{bleeding}} {{in front of the}} fourth mirror Dinda previously forgot to mention. She is confronted by Sri Sukma, who explains that the Mangkoedjiwo does indeed maintain a Kuntilanak summoned by a wangsit (a supernatural mandate) kept by their heirs, but since Sri Sukma is unable to bear children, she has chosen Sam as the next carrier of the wangsit. When Sam refuses, Sri Sukma chants durmo to summon Kuntilanak, though Sam counters with her own durmo, eventually winning out when Sri Sukma has nosebleed. Pleading Sam not to kill her, Sri Sukma says that the Kuntilanak can be stopped by removing its entrance to the living world; by breaking all mirrors. Sam manages to break the mirrors in her, Dinda, and Ratih's rooms, but forgets the one in {{the second floor}} long enough before Kuntilanak kills Sri Sukma. Two ghost children appear to take Sam, who manages to break free, only to be cornered by Kuntilanak. However, she continuously chants Sing kuat sing melihara until the Kuntilanak obeys and goes back to the mirror. The next day, Sam decides to keep the mirror so she could use it for her own deeds, disturbing Agung. She happily chants durmo as apparitions of Kuntilanak come out of the mirror.|$|R

Smeaton aimed a kick at the testes of Kafeel Ahmed, who later died from 90% burns following the attack. During the incident Smeaton also helped drag Michael Kerr to safety after Kerr had been left lying with a broken leg beside the burning jeep after kicking Ahmed.|$|R
25|$|Higgins turned {{professional}} {{at the age}} of 22, {{winning the}} World Championship at his first attempt in 1972, against John Spencer winning 37–32. Higgins was then the youngest ever winner of the title, a record retained until Stephen Hendry's 1990 victory {{at the age of}} 21. In April 1976, Higgins reached the final again and faced Ray Reardon. Higgins led 11–9, but Reardon made four centuries and seven <b>breaks</b> <b>over</b> 60 <b>to</b> pull away and win the title for the fifth time with the score of 27–16. Higgins was also the runner-up to Cliff Thorburn in 1980, losing 18–16, after being 9–5 up. Higgins won the world title for a second time in 1982 after beating Reardon 18–15 (with a 135 total clearance in the final frame); it was an emotional as well as professional victory for him. Higgins would have been ranked No. 1 in the world rankings for the 1982/83 season had he not forfeited ranking points following disciplinary action.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, due to dwindling {{sales of}} {{cellophane}} {{as a result}} of alternative packaging options, and the fact that viscose was becoming less favoured because of the polluting effects of carbon disulfide and other by-products of the process, Innovia decided to close one of its two plants at either Bridgwater or Tecumseh, east of Topeka, Kansas. British economic development officials offered a $120,000 tax <b>break</b> <b>over</b> three years <b>to</b> Innovia to preserve the Bridgwater plant, while Kansas offered $2 million if it kept the plant at Tecumseh open. As a result, the profit-making Bridgwater factory closed in the summer of 2005, while the loss-making factory in Tecumseh remained open http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/somerset/4565383.stm. 250 jobs were lost, and the site is still under development as of January 2013.|$|R
50|$|Li beat Mark Joyce in {{his opening}} match of the 2013/2014 season to reach {{the first round of}} the Wuxi Classic where he made three <b>breaks</b> <b>over</b> 50 <b>to</b> {{establish}} a 3-0 lead over world number three Judd Trump and went on to seal a 5-2 win, the best of his career so far. He was edged out 5-4 by compatriot Xiao Guodong in the following round. At the UK Championship, Li beat David Gilbert and Andrew Higginson both by 6-4 scorelines to face world number one Neil Robertson in the last 32. Li gave the Australian a competitive game but lost 6-3, with Robertson stating afterwards that Li was much better than his ranking suggested and that his safety play had particularly impressed him. Li also qualified for the German Masters and China Open but lost 5-3 to ranking event winners Barry Hawkins and Marco Fu. Li whitewashed former world champion Peter Ebdon at the Welsh Open, before being beaten 4-1 by Anthony Hamilton in the last 64. Li was ranked world number 85 at the end of the season.|$|R
50|$|Lisowski {{began the}} 2013/2014 season by {{qualifying}} for the 2013 Wuxi Classic where he whitewashed Tian Pengfei 5-0 {{in the first}} round, before being narrowly beaten 5-4 by Mark Williams in the second. At the European Tour event, the Antwerp Open, Lisowski won five matches {{to advance to the}} semi-finals where he lost 4-2 to Mark Selby. He therefore entered the UK Championship in good form and looked to be progressing into the second round as he led Michael Leslie 4-0. However, Lisowski conceded six frames in a row to be beaten by the world number 94 in a performance he described as rubbish. Alan McManus beat him 5-2 {{in the second round of}} the German Masters, but Lisowski then dropped just one frame in winning two matches to reach the third round of the Welsh Open. Lisowski built a 3-1 advantage over Barry Hawkins, before last year's World Championship runner-up made a century and two <b>breaks</b> <b>over</b> 50 <b>to</b> eliminate him 4-3. Lisowski also qualified for the China Open, but lost 5-3 against Dominic Dale in the first round.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} results of {{high-speed}} tensile tests on glass-fibre reinforced thermoplastic materials. At the moment {{there is no}} valid standard for {{the execution of the}} high-speed tensile test at plastic materials. For this reason, the standards ISO 527 - 1 and ISO 527 - 2 have been used to achieve a better comparability with the results of quasi-static tensile tests. An increase of the tensile strength could be found for the PP and PB- 1 materials examined with increasing test speed. This behaviour is described in the literature as positive strain rate dependence. Furthermore, for all examined materials a changing of the fracture behaviour could be determined. For the PP materials, at a constant strain rate in dependence of the glass-fibre content, a transition from single <b>break</b> <b>over</b> multiple <b>breaks</b> <b>to</b> multiple splinter breaks can be shown. The fracture behaviour of the PB- 1 materials also changes from single break to multiple breaks...|$|R

We'd been there for four or five nights, you know, playing those dance sets. It'd been a long night, I took a <b>break</b> and walked <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Jukebox.

50|$|With the {{enormous}} success of The Bodyguard movie and soundtrack, Houston went on an extensive world tour {{to support her}} projects. Houston began rehearsals two months after giving birth to daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown. The opening date was in Miami on July 5, 1993. Houston {{received a lot of}} flak for showing up late and then telling a fan who wanted an autograph to sit down. Houston played five nights at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, and then played six nights at the Sands Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City. Most of the shows during this 1993 US leg were in theaters because Houston wanted an intimate setting. During the US leg, Houston took a <b>break</b> <b>to</b> fly <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Europe to accompany husband Bobby Brown on his tour. Gospel act Angie & Debbie Winans were the opening act for the 1993 US leg.|$|R
