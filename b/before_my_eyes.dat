500|$|The {{risks of}} her {{profession}} were illustrated when on October 1833 she barely avoided {{being killed by}} a landslide that buried her black-and-white terrier, Tray, her constant companion when she went collecting. She wrote to a friend, Charlotte Murchison, in November of that year: [...] "Perhaps you will laugh when I say that {{the death of my}} old faithful dog has quite upset me, the cliff that fell upon him and killed him in a moment <b>before</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> and close to my feet ... it was but a moment between me and the same fate." ...|$|E
500|$|When Catherine had {{realized}} Francis {{was going to}} die, she made a pact with Antoine de Bourbon by which he would renounce his right to the regency of the future king, Charles IX, {{in return for the}} release of his brother Condé. As a result, when Francis died on 5 December 1560, the Privy Council appointed Catherine as governor of France (gouvernante de France), with sweeping powers. She wrote to her daughter Elisabeth: [...] "My principal aim is to have the honour of God <b>before</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> in all things and to preserve my authority, not for myself, but for the conservation of this kingdom and for the good of all your brothers".|$|E

500|$|From Mahler's later {{comments}} on the symphony's gestation, {{it is evident that}} the four-movement plan was relatively short-lived. He soon replaced the last three movements with a single section, essentially a dramatic cantata, based on the closing scenes of Goethe's Faust, the depiction of an ideal of redemption through eternal womanhood (das Ewige-Weibliche). Mahler had long nurtured an ambition to set the end of the Faust epic to music, [...] "and to set it quite differently from other composers who have made it saccharine and feeble." [...] In comments recorded by his biographer Richard Specht, Mahler makes no mention of the original four-movement plans. He told Specht that having chanced on the Veni creator hymn, he had a sudden vision of the complete work: [...] "I saw the whole piece immediately <b>before</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> and only needed to write it down as though it were being dictated to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Burton {{has been}} {{an outspoken critic of}} what he terms the failure of {{government}} to determine the cause of an alleged autism epidemic. When his grandson began to show the signs of autism shortly after receiving inoculations, Burton inferred the relationship to be causal: [...] "My only grandson became autistic right <b>before</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> – shortly after receiving his federally recommended and state-mandated vaccines." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hamas {{spokesman}} Moussa Abu Marzouk {{blamed the}} conflict between Hamas and Fatah on Israel, stating that the constant pressure of economic sanctions resulted in the [...] "real explosion." [...] Associated Press reporter Ibrahim Barzak wrote an eyewitness account stating: [...] "Today I have seen people shot <b>before</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> I heard the screams of terrified {{women and children in}} a burning building, and I argued with gunmen who wanted to take over my home. I have seen a lot in my years as a journalist in Gaza, but this is the worst it's been." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Without {{the consent}} of the Mafia in Piana degli Albanesi, San Giuseppe Jato and San Cipirello, Giuliano could not have shot at Portella della Ginestra," [...] {{according}} to the historian Francesco Renda. Renda, among others, was an eyewitness of the massacre. That May morning he was supposed to speak at Portella. [...] "But I got a bit late and <b>before</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> this horrific tragedy happened." [...] Renda recalls that immediately after the massacre, the peasants of Piana wanted their own justice, threatening to kill the mafiosi of their county. [...] "I convinced them,” Renda remembered, [...] "that {{that would have been the}} provocation needed to outlaw the Communists." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{symbolize the}} {{closeness}} of mother and baby, he used adjacent colors of the color wheel, green, blue and yellow in this work. The vibrant yellow background creates a warm glow around mother and baby, like a very large halo. [...] Of his use of color, Van Gogh wrote: [...] "instead of trying to reproduce exactly what I have <b>before</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> I use color... to express myself more forcibly." [...] The work contains varying brushstrokes, some straight, some turbulent - which allow {{us to see the}} movement of energy [...] "like water in a rushing stream." [...] Émile Bernard, Van Gogh's friend, was the initial owner of this painting in its provenance.|$|E
2500|$|In my {{own case}} {{the words of}} such an act as the Income Tax... merely dance <b>before</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> in a {{meaningless}} procession: cross-reference to cross-reference, exception upon exception—couched in abstract terms that offer [...] no handle to seize hold of [...] leave in my mind only a confused sense of some vitally important, but successfully concealed, purport, which it is my duty to extract, but which is within my power, if at all, only after the most inordinate expenditure of time. I know that these monsters {{are the result of}} fabulous industry and ingenuity, plugging up this hole and casting out that net, against all possible evasion; yet at times I cannot help recalling a saying of William James about certain passages of Hegel: that they were no doubt written with a passion of rationality; but that one cannot help wondering whether to the reader they have any significance save that the words are strung together with syntactical correctness.|$|E

2500|$|André St-Pierre is the {{director}} of the episodes. He is best known as the co-director of the Télé-Québec show Les Francs-Tireurs and La Job was his first fiction. Script adaptation was given to Ian Lauzon and Jean-Philippe Granger was made screenwriter. Like the American Office, improv veterans were called to fill the shoes of some of the original actors. The role of the David Brent boss was entrusted to Antoine Vézina, a performer of the reputed Ligue nationale d'improvisation (LNI), a Quebec-born concept of improvisational theatre and international improv team competition (Quebec, France, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy). Sophie Cadieux, who holds the role corresponding to Dawn Tinsley, has also taken part in the LNI. Paul Ahmarani, playing La Jobs Gareth Keenan, is a great fan of the British series. About the black humor of the show, he comments: [...] "Personally, when I began watching that show, after five minutes, I knew that I had <b>before</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> something unique, that would literally shatter all that we had seen before". On his character, he sums up that [...] "I'm someone that is very much of a coward, so I like to take refuge in military fantasies of virility... I really like to say that I spent three years in the army... I'm a bit of a loser, very right-wing, very militarist". Sébastien Huberdeau, the Tim Canterbury equivalent, was seen on international screens in The Barbarian Invasions, winner of the 2004 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Haggard {{released}} [...] "Okie From Muskogee," [...] with lyrics ostensibly {{reflecting the}} singer's {{pride in being}} from Middle America where people are conventionally patriotic, don't smoke marijuana, don't take LSD, don't protest by burning draft cards or otherwise challenge authority. In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values. In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a [...] "documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time." [...] However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the Bob Edwards Show, he said, [...] "I wrote it when I recently {{got out of the}} joint. I knew {{what it was like to}} lose my freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters. They didn't know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. I thought how my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt." [...] In the country music documentary series Lost Highway, he elaborated: [...] "My dad passed away when I was nine, and I don't know if you've ever thought about somebody you've lost and you say, 'I wonder what so-and-so would think about this?' I was drivin' on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said '19 Miles to Muskogee.' Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as 'back home.' So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed <b>before</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and I thought, 'I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins.... I understood 'em, I got along with it, but what if he was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin' in the center of the country sayin', 'What is goin' on on these campuses?'" [...] In the American Masters documentary about him, he said, [...] "That's how I got into it with the hippies.... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, 'You sons of bitches, you've never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin' about things, protesting about a war that they didn't know any more about than I did. They weren't over there fightin' that war any more than I was." ...|$|E

60|$|I bought all {{the comic}} papers that I could find, even the {{illustrated}} ones.
