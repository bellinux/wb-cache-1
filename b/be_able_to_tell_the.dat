Many reviewers stress in turn that Monster cables are not needed for lower-resolution televisions or over short distances and that the difference in audio quality is not substantial enough.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the move from Zeus to Nike-X was concern that the Zeus radars would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> {{difference}} between the warhead and a decoy until it was too late to launch. One solution to this problem was the Sprint missile, which had the performance required to wait until decluttering was complete. Another potential solution was to look for some sort of signature of the reentry through the highest levels of the atmosphere that might differ between a warhead and decoy; specifically, it appeared that the ablation of the heat shield might produce a clear signature pointing out the warhead.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Ciaran Donnelly, who also directed the previous episode. Mike Bullen visited Sydney in March 2001 to scout for locations. He was followed in May by producer Spencer Campbell and production designer Chris Truelove, who made preliminary casting decisions and scouted more locations. They finalised the arrangements in July. Unusually, the production schedule was drawn up without a final script in place. This caused complications as Campbell allocated too much time for filming in Sydney and not enough in Manchester. As a result, some scenes set in Sydney were filmed in Manchester; the scene where the characters arrive at Sydney Airport was filmed in a hall at the University of Manchester. Campbell rationalised that viewers {{who had never been}} to Sydney would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> difference.|$|E
40|$|Scientific, {{and more}} {{specifically}} empirical observations, are incapable of deriving a cohesive moral theory based solely on those distinctions. What we find in the ethical world is far more complex than any one series of observations and scientific theories which could establish or break down existing moral theory. Definitions and ethical codes regarding behavior require a more robust and creative approach. The thesis of this paper is, then, no scientific descriptions are descriptions that <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us how things ought to be. A valid standard form categorical syllogism can be formulated to demonstrate how this conclusion is arrived at by logical necessity. CELARENT EAE- 1 No descriptions of what exists are descriptions that <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us how things ought to be. All scientific descriptions are descriptions of what exists. Therefore, no scientific descriptions are descriptions that <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us how things ought to be. The major categorical term of this argument is descriptions that <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us ho...|$|R

500|$|Small, {{relatively}} weak landspouts may be visible {{only as a}} small swirl of dust on the ground. Although the condensation funnel may not extend {{all the way to}} the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than , the circulation is considered a tornado. A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative low height is sometimes referred to as a [...] "stovepipe" [...] tornado. Large single-vortex tornadoes can look like large wedges stuck into the ground, and so are known as [...] "wedge tornadoes" [...] or [...] "wedges". The [...] "stovepipe" [...] classification is also used for this type of tornado if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground. Even experienced storm observers may not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance. Many, but not all major tornadoes are wedges.|$|E
500|$|Dr.Dre {{has said}} that his primary {{instrument}} in the studio is the Akai MPC3000, a drum machine and sampler, and that he often uses {{as many as four}} or five to produce a single recording. He cites 1970s funk musicians such as George Clinton, Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield as his primary musical influences. Unlike most rap producers, he tries to avoid samples as much as possible, preferring to have studio musicians re-play pieces of music he wants to use, because it allows him more flexibility to change the pieces in rhythm and tempo. In 2001 he told Time magazine, [...] "I may hear something I like on an old record that may inspire me, but I'd rather use musicians to re-create the sound or elaborate on it. I can control it better." [...] Other equipment he uses include the E-mu SP-1200 drum machine and other keyboards from such manufacturers as Korg, Rhodes, Wurlitzer, Moog, and Roland. Dr. Dre also stresses the importance of equalizing drums properly, telling Scratch magazine in 2004 that he [...] "used the same drum sounds on a couple of different songs on one album before but you'd never <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> difference because of the EQ." [...] Dr. Dre also uses the digital audio workstation, Pro Tools and uses the software to combine hardware drum machines and vintage analog keyboards and synthesizers.|$|E
500|$|Ballo's father {{subsequently}} wrote a {{book about}} his daughter's suicide. He decided not to give interviews to the press about his ordeal until the book was published. He wanted to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> story and impact of his daughter's death, on his own terms. Titled, Kaja: 1988–2008, the book explores the sequence of events that led to his daughter's death, from her time studying French in Nice. Her early history of psychiatric treatment is discussed in the book. He recounts the difficulties in getting information about his daughter's death from government authorities. According to the author, there was a slow response in receiving help from the Foreign Ministry of Norway. In an interview with Politiken, he explained the motivation for writing the book: [...] "After the funeral I felt I had to do something relating to grief. This was my way to process the grief. The second issue was that I needed to transcribe the account to later tell my little daughter Oda." [...] He also said, [...] "I wanted to contribute to greater openness about suicide." [...] He acknowledged, [...] "Losing a child means that life is turned upside down. I believe that grief becomes heavier if you do not share it with anyone." [...] The book was written with input from other family members.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} years saw Morrissey cast in two high-profile feature films; while filming the Brian Jones biopic Stoned (2005), {{he got an}} audition for psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass, the male lead in Basic Instinct 2 (2006). He was flown out to Los Angeles for a one-hour screen test with Sharon Stone. Their immediate rapport led to the screen test being extended by another hour and Morrissey's casting in the role. Morrissey had enjoyed the first film and liked the script for the sequel. He read up on psychiatry and worked out in a gym for the nudity scenes. The film was a box office and critical failure. The Washington Post criticised the film's focus on Morrissey's character and called the actor [...] "overmatched by Stone" [...] and [...] "a sad sack", and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called him [...] "a charisma-challenged non-entity". The same Washington Post critic later wrote in the Los Angeles Times that because Morrissey was not a film star, the chemistry between him and Stone had been spoiled. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club wrote that Morrissey had [...] "the charisma of beige wallpaper" [...] and that [...] "the producers could have replaced him halfway through shooting with a handsome mahogany coat rack and nobody would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> difference". The bad reviews depressed Morrissey, and he briefly considered giving up acting, but instead saw the role {{as a chance to}} learn.|$|E

2500|$|Strabo does {{explain his}} reasons for doubting Pytheas' veracity. Citing {{numerous}} instances of Pytheas apparently being far off the mark on details concerning known regions, he says: [...] "however, any man who has told such great falsehoods about the known regions would hardly, I imagine, <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> truth about places that are not known to anybody." [...] As an example he mentions that Pytheas says Kent is several days' sail from Celtica when it is visible from Gaul across the channel.

2500|$|Similarly, the Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer {{told that}} when God began {{to create the}} first person, God began to collect dust from {{the four corners of}} the world – red, black, white, and yellow. Explaining why God {{gathered}} the first person's dust from the four corners of the world, God said that if a person should travel from the east to the west, or from the west to the east, and the time should come for the person to depart from the world, then the earth would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> person that the dust of the person's body was not of the earth there, and that the person needed to return to the place from which the person had been created. This teaches that in every place where a person comes or goes, should the person approach the time to die, in that place is the dust of the person's body, and there the person's body will return to the dust, as [...] says, [...] "For dust you are, and to dust shall you return." ...|$|E
2500|$|There is {{a longstanding}} custom of {{drinking}} wine at the feast. [...] The custom {{stems from a}} statement in the Talmud attributed to a rabbi named Rava that says one should drink on Purim until he can [...] "no longer distinguish between arur Haman ('Cursed is Haman') and baruch Mordechai ('Blessed is Mordecai')." [...] The drinking of wine features prominently {{in keeping with the}} jovial nature of the feast, but also helps simulate the experience of spiritual blindness, wherein one cannot distinguish between good (Mordechai) and evil (Haman). This is {{based on the fact that}} the salvation of the Jews occurred through wine. Alcoholic consumption was later codified by the early authorities, and while some advocated total intoxication, others, consistent with the opinion of many early and later rabbis, taught that one should only drink a little more than usual and then fall asleep, whereupon one will certainly not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> difference between arur Haman ("cursed be Haman") and baruch Mordecai ("blessed be Mordechai"). Other authorities, including the Magen Avraham, have written that one should drink until one is unable to calculate the gematria (numerical values) of both phrases.|$|E
