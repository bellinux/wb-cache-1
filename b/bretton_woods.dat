5|$|From 1944, the Allies became {{increasingly}} concerned with laying {{the framework of}} post-war Europe. These were formalized through numerous treaties and agreements from 1944. In July 1944, Camille Gutt attended the <b>Bretton</b> <b>Woods</b> Conference in the United States {{on behalf of the}} Belgian government, establishing the <b>Bretton</b> <b>Woods</b> System of currency controls. During the negotiations, Gutt served as an important intermediary between the delegates of the major Allied powers. Through the agreements, the Belgian Franc's exchange rate would be tied to the American Dollar after the war, while the conference also established the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of which Gutt would serve as the first director.|$|E
5|$|As the {{inception}} of the United Nations as an intergovernmental entity slowly began formalizing in 1944, delegates from 44 of its early member states met at a hotel in <b>Bretton</b> <b>Woods,</b> New Hampshire for the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, now commonly referred to as the <b>Bretton</b> <b>Woods</b> conference. Delegates remained cognizant {{of the effects of the}} Great Depression, struggles to sustain the international gold standard during the 1930s, and related market instabilities. Whereas previous discourse on the international monetary system focused on fixed versus floating exchange rates, <b>Bretton</b> <b>Woods</b> delegates favored pegged exchange rates for their flexibility. Under this system, nations would peg their exchange rates to the U.S. dollar, which would be convertible to gold at $35 USD per ounce. This arrangement is commonly referred to as the <b>Bretton</b> <b>Woods</b> system. Rather than maintaining fixed rates, nations would peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar and allow their exchange rates to fluctuate within a 1% band of the agreed-upon parity. To meet this requirement, central banks would intervene via sales or purchases of their currencies against the dollar. Members could adjust their pegs in response to long-run fundamental disequillibria in the balance of payments, but were responsible for correcting imbalances via fiscal and monetary policy tools before resorting to repegging strategies. The adjustable pegging enabled greater exchange rate stability for commercial and financial transactions which fostered unprecedented growth in international trade and foreign investment. This feature grew from delegates' experiences in the 1930s when excessively volatile exchange rates and the reactive protectionist exchange controls that followed proved destructive to trade and prolonged the deflationary effects of the Great Depression. Capital mobility faced de facto limits under the system as governments instituted restrictions on capital flows and aligned their monetary policy to support their pegs.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{exchange}} rate stability sustained by the <b>Bretton</b> <b>Woods</b> system facilitated expanding international trade, this early success masked its underlying design flaw, wherein there existed no mechanism for increasing the supply of international reserves to support continued growth in trade. The system began experiencing insurmountable market pressures and deteriorating cohesion among its key participants in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Central banks needed more U.S. dollars to hold as reserves, but were unable to expand their money supplies if doing so meant exceeding their dollar reserves and threatening their exchange rate pegs. To accommodate these needs, the <b>Bretton</b> <b>Woods</b> system depended on the United States to run dollar deficits. As a consequence, the dollar's value began exceeding its gold backing. During the early 1960s, investors could sell gold for a greater dollar exchange rate in London than in the United States, signaling to market participants that the dollar was overvalued. Belgian-American economist Robert Triffin defined this problem {{now known as the}} Triffin dilemma, in which a country's national economic interests conflict with its international objectives as the custodian of the world's reserve currency.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} component of the <b>Bretton</b> <b>Woods</b> agreements was the creation of two new international financial institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Collectively referred to as the <b>Bretton</b> <b>Woods</b> institutions, they became operational in 1947 and 1946 respectively. The IMF was established to support the monetary system by facilitating cooperation on international monetary issues, providing advisory and technical assistance to members, and offering emergency lending to nations experiencing repeated difficulties restoring the balance of payments equilibrium. Members would contribute funds to a pool according to their share of gross world product, from which emergency loans could be issued. Member states were authorized and encouraged to employ capital controls as necessary to manage payments imbalances and meet pegging targets, but prohibited from relying on IMF financing to cover particularly short-term capital hemorrhages. While the IMF was instituted to guide members and provide a short-term financing window for recurrent balance of payments deficits, the IBRD was established to serve as a type of financial intermediary for channeling global capital toward long-term investment opportunities and postwar reconstruction projects. The creation of these organizations was a crucial milestone {{in the evolution of the}} international financial architecture, and some economists consider it the most significant achievement of multilateral cooperation following World War II. Since the establishment of the International Development Association (IDA) in 1960, the IBRD and IDA are together known as the World Bank. While the IBRD lends to middle-income developing countries, the IDA extends the Bank's lending program by offering concessional loans and grants to the world's poorest nations.|$|E
5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European Currency Unit (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the <b>Bretton</b> <b>Woods</b> system. Similarly to <b>Bretton</b> <b>Woods</b> however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|E

40|$|Trying to find {{explanations}} to {{movements in}} the exchange rate is something that econo-mists have been dealing with to a great extend lately. Especially since the break down of the <b>Bretton</b> <b>Wood</b> system in the early 1970 ’s, when many countries introduced a floating sys-tem instead. One {{of the most famous}} and often tested models is Jeffery A. Frankel’s Real Interest Differential (RID) model from 1979. This paper investigates which of the variables included in the model are affecting move-ments in the exchange rate for Sweden, the UK and Japan against the US dollar between January 1995 and December 2004. The variables in question are money supply, industrial production, interest rate and inflation differential. The model has purchasing power parity and uncovered interest parity as underlying theoretical assumptions, two main building blocks of open macro economics, and when combined, they can offer a relationship be-tween changes in the exchange rate and the interest rate differential. The results show that the variable interest rate differential constitutes a significant explana-tory variable for exchange rate movements regarding all three countries included in the model. Both Sweden and the UK have also, in accordance with the RID model, the ex-pected negative sign on the coefficient. The results regarding the other variables are mixed between the countries, but it can in general be said that the model seems to be able to ex-plain {{movements in the}} exchange rate to a certain degree...|$|R

5|$|As the Allied victory {{began to}} look certain, Keynes was heavily involved, {{as leader of the}} British {{delegation}} and chairman of the World Bank commission, in the mid-1944 negotiations that established the <b>Bretton</b> <b>Woods</b> system.

He proposed the creation of a common world unit of currency, the bancor, and new global institutions – a world central bank and the International Clearing Union. Keynes envisaged these institutions managing an international trade and payments system with strong incentives for countries to avoid substantial trade deficits or surpluses. The USA's greater negotiating strength, however, meant that the final outcomes accorded more closely to the more conservative plans of Harry Dexter White. According to US economist J.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three empirical and one theoretical essays on three determinants of financial development (FD) namely government ownership of banks, foreign capital inflows (FCI) and institutional quality. Some research has concluded that government ownership of banks negatively affects their soundness. <b>Bretton</b> <b>Wood</b> institutions have used these conclusions to advocate for state-owned banks privatization. The first essay shows that this research was weak {{in the way it}} controlled for fundamental determinants of soundness of banks, and lacked rigorous econometric analysis. With data covering 2001 - 2011, we show that if there is any relationship between government ownership of banks and their subsequent soundness, it is positive. These results are robust to various measures of FD, institutional quality and econometric approaches. The second essay presents a theoretical model predicting a negative relationship between Official Development Assistance (ODA) and FD when political institutions are weak. The third essay empirically investigates the hypothesis that the effects of ODA on FD are influenced by the level of democracy in recipient countries. Using a panel data for 37 developing countries covering 1980 - 2005, we apply different econometric approaches (pooled OLS, IV 2 SLS, fixed effects and dynamic GMM) to show that while ODA is harmful to FD in autocracies it could be effective in democracies. These results are robust to various measures of FD and democracy. The fourth essay is an empirical investigation of the hypothesis that different types of FCIs have different impacts on credit availability in developing countries. Using 5 -year average data for 53 developing countries covering 1990 - 2013 and disaggregating FCIs into their main five types, we apply OLS, fixed effects, and dynamic GMM to show that there is a positive and statistically significant relationship between FDI, debt and equity and private credit while remittances and ODA are not significant determinants of private credit in developing countries...|$|R
30|$|The down fall of <b>Bretton</b> <b>Wood</b> {{system in}} 1971 obligate {{industrial}} economies {{to change from}} fixed exchange rate to a floating system. This change brought greater volatility for both the nominal and the real exchange rate (Stockman 1983; Mussa 1986). The monetary authorities were {{held responsible for the}} greater volatility of real exchange rates during the 1970 s. Theoretically, Dornbusch (1976) displayed that unexpected monetary policy shocks might produce unduly large fluctuations in the exchange rates overshooting effect. Nevertheless, the hypothesis that monetary constancy was the only reason of exchange rate volatility lost ground as majority of industrial economies have stabilized inflation at annual rates lower than 3 percent. The incapability of monetary models to imitate and anticipate exchange rate fluctuations which implies that monetary volatility {{is only one of the}} some factors driving exchange rate volatility (Meese and Rogoff 1983). Policymakers strives to attain economic growth and price stability, therefore, volatile real exchange rates are connected with impulsive movements in the comparative prices in the economy. Exchange rate constancy is one of the chief factors that encourage stable economic growth, price stability and total investment in the economies. A current strand of the literature, the so-called “New Open Economy Macroeconomics”, argues that non-monetary factors have gained importance in explaining exchange rate volatility. They explain that productivity shocks, terms of trade shocks, government spending, trade openness and net foreign assets are very important factors in explaining real exchange rate volatility (Calderón 2004;Alam and Ahmed 2010). Serven (2002) argues that real exchange rate uncertainty is costly for the private investment in low developing countries. The high real exchange rate volatility that portrays developing economies produces an uncertain environment for investment as firm’s mark up, which reflects market power of the firm, international exposure of exports and imports, perception about future demand of goods and cost of new capital goods become difficult to forecast.|$|R
5|$|Influenced by Keynes, {{economics}} {{texts in}} the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade.

However, in more recent years, {{since the end of the}} <b>Bretton</b> <b>Woods</b> system in 1971, with the increasing influence of Monetarist schools of thought in the 1980s, and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances, these concerns – and particularly concerns about the destabilising effects of large trade surpluses – have largely disappeared from mainstream economics discourse and Keynes' insights have slipped from view.

Among others, Hyman Minsky and Post-Keynesian economists have argued that as result, Keynes's ideas were diluted by those keen to compromise with classical economists or to render his concepts with mathematical models like the IS–LM model (which, they argue, distort Keynes's ideas). Keynes began to recover in 1939, {{but for the rest of}} his life his professional energies were largely directed towards the practical side of economics – the problems of ensuring optimum allocation of resources for the war efforts, post-war negotiations with America, and the new international financial order that was presented at the <b>Bretton</b> <b>Woods</b> Conference.|$|E
5|$|A state {{wishing to}} devalue, {{or at least}} check the {{appreciation}} of its currency, must work within {{the constraints of the}} prevailing International monetary system. During the 1930s, countries had relatively more direct control over their exchange rates through the actions of their central banks. Following the collapse of the <b>Bretton</b> <b>Woods</b> system in the early 1970s, markets substantially increased in influence, with market forces largely setting the exchange rates for an increasing number of countries. However, a state's central bank can still intervene in the markets to effect a devaluation – if it sells its own currency to buy other currencies then this will cause the value of its own currency to fall – a practice common with states that have a managed exchange rate regime. Less directly, quantitative easing (common in 2009 and 2010), tends to lead to a fall {{in the value of the}} currency even if the central bank does not directly buy any foreign assets.|$|E
40|$|As a {{culturally}} distinctive region, Asia {{was chosen as}} the sample for this study. This empirical study investigated what the major trends of democratisation were in Asia between 1981 and 2005 : why some countries became democratic while other countries failed to follow suit during that period. The main research hypothesis was: “That is it was mainly economic development that drove democratisation in Asia between 1981 and 2005 ”. Although some studies have studied the impact of economic development on democratisation in Asia, their findings have been inconclusive and focuses sometimes different. [To investigate the research hypothesis, 24 Asian countries were selected…measurement tools used etc…] For this research work, statistical and case study methods were applied. The data used in the analyses were collected from established data sources e. g. Freedom House (Freedom in the World, n. d.) and United Nations Statistics Division (UN Stat, n. d.). Repeated Measures in Linear Mixed Modeling (LMM) were used to analyse the quantitative data. Three case studies supplemented the findings of statistical analyses. Historical information and institutional and legal facts were also used in the case studies. This study found that increases in the level of economic development along with its equitable distribution in society and positive roles of political actors increase the level of democratisation in Asia. Some pro-democratic political and social institutions, such as tradition of parliamentarianism, and international organisations, for example <b>Bretton</b> <b>wood</b> institutions, also led to democratisation. A low extent of national political divide was found to result in a considerably high level of democratisation in a country where confrontation between major political forces is the main feature of politics. This study also found that a partial democracy with Asian values, economic legitimacy, a lack of corruption and a “systematic control” over opposition politicians can survive, and is not prone to higher level of democratisation. The Taiwan case revealed that, amongst other factors, the role of political actors and economic equity along with economic development is also vital for democratisation. The Singapore case explained how a “hybrid regime” in a rich country outsmarts democratisation. The study of Bangladesh provides an idea about other elements, e. g. lower level of political confrontation, that push for higher levels of democratisation...|$|R
