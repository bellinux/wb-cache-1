50|$|Battles can {{be fought}} on land, at sea and, {{in the modern}} age, in the air. Naval <b>battles</b> <b>have</b> {{occurred}} since before the 5th century BC. Air <b>battles</b> <b>have</b> been far less common, due to their late conception, the most prominent being the Battle of Britain in 1940. However, since the Second World War land or sea <b>battles</b> <b>have</b> {{come to rely on}} air support. Indeed, during the Battle of Midway, five aircraft carriers were sunk without either fleet coming into direct contact.|$|R

5|$|About {{the same}} time Nobel Prize-winner Henryk Sienkiewicz wrote the novel The Knights of the Cross (Polish: Krzyżacy), {{prominently}} featuring the battle {{in one of the}} chapters. In 1960 Polish filmmaker Aleksander Ford used the book as the basis for his film, Knights of the Teutonic Order. A museum, monuments and memorials were constructed at the battlefield in 1960. The battle site is one of Poland's official, national Historic Monuments, as designated October 4, 2010, and tracked by the National Heritage Board of Poland. The <b>battle</b> <b>has</b> lent its name to military decorations (Cross of Grunwald), sports teams (BC Žalgiris, FK Žalgiris), and various organizations.|$|E

Marcus is soon outclassed in strength and temporarily disabled until John {{comes to his}} aid. Marcus eventually defeats the T-800, while John destroys the Skynet base by rigging together explosives. John, Marcus, Kyle, and Star are airlifted out. John though was seriously wounded during the assault with a life-threatening injury to his heart. Marcus offers his own heart for transplantation, sacrificing himself to save John. As he recovers, John radios to other Resistance fighters that, although this <b>battle</b> <b>has</b> been won, the war is still not over.|$|E

5|$|Other raids {{and small}} skirmishes {{took place in}} Indiana during the war, but the Battle of Corydon was the only pitched battle fought in the state.

In 1976 the site was preserved as the Corydon Battle Site memorial park and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 9, 1979. Today {{it is part of}} the John Hunt Morgan Heritage Trail. The <b>battle</b> <b>has</b> been re-enacted each year since 1980.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Corydon {{was a minor}} {{engagement}} {{that took}} place July 9, 1863, just south of Corydon, which had been the original capital of Indiana until 1825, and was the county seat of Harrison County. The attack occurred during Morgan's Raid in the American Civil War as a force of 2,500 cavalry invaded the North {{in support of the}} Tullahoma Campaign. It was the only pitched battle of the Civil War that occurred in Indiana, and no <b>battle</b> <b>has</b> occurred within Indiana since.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Romani was {{the first}} {{large-scale}} mounted and infantry victory by the British Empire in the First World War.

The <b>battle</b> <b>has</b> been widely acknowledged as a strategic victory and a turning point in the campaign to restore Egypt's territorial integrity and security, and marked the end of the land campaign against the Suez Canal.|$|E

5|$|The <b>battle</b> <b>has</b> {{been widely}} {{described}} as the largest tank engagement or battle in military history, involving 1,200–1,500 tanks and sometimes up to 2,000, but this is incorrect as the battle did not involve that many tanks. The exaggerated figures originated from erroneous Soviet intelligence estimates of German armour reported {{during and after the}} battle, and subsequent postwar accounts that furthered this erroneous narrative. Some of these Soviet estimates reported figures as high as 800 German tanks and assault guns attacking Prokhorovka on 12 July.|$|E
5|$|The <b>battle</b> <b>has</b> {{gone down}} in history as one of the turning points of the War of the Spanish Succession. Bavaria was knocked out of the war, and Louis' hopes for a quick victory came to an end. France {{suffered}} over 38,000 casualties including the commander-in-chief, Marshal Tallard, who was taken captive to England. Before the 1704 campaign ended, the Allies had taken Landau, and the towns of Trier and Trarbach on the Moselle in preparation for the following year's campaign into France itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle of}} Uhud {{is the second}} of the two main battles {{featured}} in Moustapha Akkad's 1976 film centering on the life of Muhammad, Mohammad, Messenger of God. The other battle featured is the battle of Badr. The battle of Uhud is also depicted in the 2004 animated film, , directed by Richard Rich, and in the 2012 TV series Farouk Omar. The cave in Mount Uhud where Muhammad rested temporarily during the <b>battle</b> <b>has</b> also received recent media attention in the light of proposals by some Islamic scholars for it to be destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The first English-language {{histories}} of the battle were written and published by Texas Ranger and amateur historian John Henry Brown. The next major treatment of the battle was Reuben Potter's The Fall of the Alamo, published in The Magazine of American History in 1878. Potter based his work on interviews {{with many of the}} Mexican survivors of the battle. The first full-length, non-fiction book covering the battle, John Myers Myers' The Alamo, was published in 1948. In the decades since, the <b>battle</b> <b>has</b> featured prominently in many non-fiction works.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later the British Second Army {{launched}} Operation Charnwood, to take Caen. This incorporated the postponed attack on Carpiquet, originally planned for Epsom as Operation Ottawa but now codenamed Operation Windsor. In a frontal assault the northern half {{of the city was}} captured, with the remaining portions being taken during Operations Atlantic and Goodwood in the third week of July. Fighting in the Odon Valley continued and on 10 July Operation Jupiter was launched by VIII Corps to push back the German forces near the village of Baron-sur-Odon, retake Hill 112 and advance to the River Orne. The Second Battle of the Odon began on 15 July to divert German attention from the ground where Operation Goodwood was to take place. The second <b>battle</b> <b>has</b> been called one of the bloodiest encounters of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} Polish casualties—or {{according}} to one historian, possibly because of them—the <b>battle</b> <b>has</b> been largely neglected in Polish historiography. During {{the period of the}} People's Republic of Poland it was portrayed merely as a difficult but victorious battle. However, since the fall of communism modern Polish historians have been much more critical of Świerczewski's command, blaming his drive on Dresden for the near destruction of the Polish force. Świerczewski's lack of competence, according to some sources, included commanding the battle while drunk. He was briefly relieved of command by Marshal Konev, but due to the backing of the Soviet high command (most likely the NKVD) he not only retained his position but all controversies were hushed up, and after the war was hailed as a hero. The actions of other Polish officers have also been questioned, such as the 9th Infantry Division commander's decision to advance without sufficient reconnaissance and escort.|$|E

5|$|Historical {{reaction}} to the <b>battle</b> <b>has</b> focused on the significantly stronger British position in the encounter, with three large regular warships pitted against a hastily converted merchant vessel with {{a significant proportion of}} the crew suffering from illness. Duguay-Trouin was also weakly built and weakly armed: early estimates that the Duguay Trouins main battery mounted twenty-six 18-pounder long guns were revised to 12-pounders with eight smaller cannon on the upper deck. The British blockade of Isle de France continued throughout the year, with Centurion engaged in an inconclusive action against a French squadron in October. Although Isle de France remained in French hands throughout the conflict, the Indian Ocean was largely under British control by 1796.|$|E
5|$|On September 1, 1857, a joint {{force of}} Mohave and Quechan warriors {{launched}} a major attack {{with hundreds of}} warriors on a Maricopa village close to Maricopa Wells, Arizona, on the Gila river. The Battle of Pima Butte was described {{by a group of}} white mail carriers who witnessed it. They stated that the battle was fought mostly with clubs, as well as bows and arrows, and that probably more than 100 warriors died, most of them from the attacking party. It is unknown whether Irataba participated in the attack, but given his status as kwanami, it is likely that he did. The <b>battle</b> <b>has</b> been described as the last major battle involving only Native American nations. This defeat put the Mohave on the defensive, wary of the possibility that whites would take this moment of weakness as an opportunity to begin settling on tribal lands.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Red Cliffs, {{otherwise}} known as the Battle of Chibi, was a decisive battle fought {{at the end of}} the Han dynasty, about twelve years prior to the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history. It was fought in the winter of AD 208/9 between the allied forces of the southern warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan and the numerically superior forces of the northern warlord Cao Cao. Liu Bei and Sun Quan successfully frustrated Cao Cao's effort to conquer the land south of the Yangtze River and reunite the territory of the Eastern Han dynasty. The allied victory at Red Cliffs ensured the survival of Liu Bei and Sun Quan, gave them control of the Yangtze , and provided a line of defence that was the basis for the later creation of the two southern states of Shu Han and Eastern Wu. The <b>battle</b> <b>has</b> been called the largest naval battle in history in terms of numbers involved.|$|E
