5|$|In the Third Intermediate Period and the {{following}} Late Period (664–323 BC), the weakened Egyptian state fell {{to a series of}} outside powers, experiencing only occasional periods of independence. Many of these foreign rulers funded and expanded temples to strengthen their claim to the kingship of Egypt. One such group, the Kushite pharaohs of the eighth and seventh centuriesBC, adopted Egyptian-style temple architecture for use in their native land of Nubia, beginning a long tradition of sophisticated Nubian temple building. Amid this turmoil, the fortunes of various temples and clergies shifted and the independence of Amun's priesthood was broken, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of the priesthood in general remained.|$|E
5|$|One {{method is}} to use the ground as a heat sink by drawing air through {{underground}} pipes. This is often done to provide a source of cool air for a building by means of a ground-coupled heat exchanger (also known as Earth tubes), wherein condensation is typically regarded as a significant problem. A major problem with such designs is that the underground tubes are subject to contamination and difficult to keep clean. Designs of this type require air to be drawn through the pipes by a fan, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> required may be provided (or supplemented) by a wind turbine.|$|E

25|$|As {{the only}} General Secretary to defect from the CCP and be {{executed}} by KMT, Xiang {{was regarded as}} a disgrace in CCP history. The CCP sought to erase any memory of him.

25|$|Goguryeo {{reached its}} zenith in the 6th century. After this, however, it began a steady decline. Anjang was assassinated, and succeeded {{by his brother}} Anwon, during whose reign aristocratic factionalism increased. A {{political}} schism deepened as two factions advocated different princes for succession, until the eight-year-old Yang-won was finally crowned. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> struggle was never resolved definitively, as renegade magistrates with private armies appointed themselves de facto rulers of their areas of control.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission {{stated that}} it would revise its safety {{guidelines}} and would require the installation of additional power sources.

25|$|In the 1850s, many {{of these}} {{problems}} were solved by the arc lamp invented by William Petrie and William Staite. The lamp used a magneto-electric generator and had a self-regulating mechanism to control {{the gap between the}} two carbon rods. Their light was used to light up the National Gallery in London and was a great novelty at the time. These arc lamps and designs similar to it, powered by large magnetos, were first installed on English lighthouses in the mid 1850s, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> limitations prevented these models from being a proper success.|$|E
25|$|A third {{fight between}} them was held on March 13, 1961 and while Johansson put Patterson on the floor, Patterson {{retained}} his title by knockout in the sixth round to win the rubber match in which Patterson was decked twice and Johansson, once in the first round. Johansson had landed both right hands over Floyd's left jab. After getting up from the second knockdown, Floyd abandoned his jab and connected with a left hook that knocked down Johansson. After that, Patterson came on with a strong body attack that wore down Johansson. In the 6th round, Johansson caught Patterson with a solid right. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> in Ingemar's punches was gone. Patterson won the fight in the 6th round by knockout.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 13th century, the Mongol Empire invaded Russia and {{proceeded}} to establish a hegemony over the Russian states. The {{most important of these}} was the duchy of Vladimir, the most powerful Russian principality at the time. The extent of Mongol power was so great that the Golden Horde had the power to issue a jarlig, or decree, that allowed the Russian princes to rule over their lands, only if they swore allegiance to the Mongol Empire. When confidence fell for the rule of the princes of Vladimir, various factions in the principality began to jostle for power, and the region divided itself into several states, including Tver, Moscow, and others. All these states acknowledged the rule of the prince of Vladimir, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> had become notional at best by the dawn of the fourteenth century.|$|E

25|$|A Class 1M laser is {{safe for}} all {{conditions}} of use except when passed through magnifying optics such as microscopes and telescopes. Class1M lasers produce large-diameter beams, or beams that are divergent. The MPE for a Class1M laser cannot normally be exceeded unless focusing or imaging optics are used to narrow the beam. If the beam is refocused, the hazard of Class1M lasers may be increased and the product class may be changed. A laser can be classified as Class1M if the power that can pass through the pupil of the naked eye {{is less than the}} AEL for Class1, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> that can be collected into the eye by typical magnifying optics (as defined in the standard) is higher than the AEL for Class1 and lower than the AEL for Class3B.|$|E
25|$|The oral {{tradition}} {{of that time}} depicted {{the irony of the}} rivalries and adversities attracted to the Ado Township and the Ewi when describing her quest for expansion in Ekiti as popularly recounted thus: ‘Ogun yeye, b’Ewi ja, Ajase I loo Ewi’ Meaning ‘Many are the adversity of the King of Ado-Ekiti (Ewi), <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of triumph lies in his hands.’ The continuous opposition to Ewi’s paramountcy by a large number of Ekiti royalties across the country is a pointer to the fear inherent in Ewi’s notable imperial ambitions from 17th to 19th century, which became threats on the status and economy of other notable towns, who were also aiming at prominence and equality within the regional power sharing structure of Ekiti country. No doubt, the characteristics of town formation in Ado-Ekiti area distinguish the mother town (the metropolis) where the most important chiefs reside from the subordinate towns where other rulers existed.|$|E
25|$|About {{a century}} later, the Sumerian king Shulgi of the Neo-Sumerian Empire retook {{the city of}} Susa and the {{surrounding}} region. During {{the first part of}} the rule of the Simashki dynasty, Elam was under intermittent attack from the Sumerians of Mesopotamia and also Gutians from northwestern Iran, alternating with periods of peace and diplomatic approaches. The Elamite state of Simashki at this time also extended into northern Iran, and possibly even as far as the Caspian Sea. Shu-Sin of Ur gave one of his daughters in marriage to a prince of Anshan. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of the Sumerians was waning; Ibbi-Sin in the 21st century did not manage to penetrate far into Elam, and in 2004 BC, the Elamites, allied with the people of Susa and led by king Kindattu, the sixth king of Simashki, managed to sack Ur and lead Ibbi-Sin into captivity, ending the third dynasty of Ur. The Akkadian kings of Isin, successor state to Ur, managed to drive the Elamites out of Ur, rebuild the city, and to return the statue of Nanna that the Elamites had plundered.|$|E

25|$|The Express Pass, {{introduced}} in season 17, is given as a prize {{on an early}} leg of the race (usually the first leg, though it was awarded on the second leg of season 21 and offered on the second leg of season 25, and awarded on the sixth leg (to {{be used by the}} end of the ninth) of season 28). It allows the team to skip any single task (including Roadblocks, Detours, and miscellaneous tasks, but not the Fast Forward task), once, during the race. The choice of which task to skip is at the team's discretion, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>power,</b> if unused, expires at the end of Leg 8. The Express pass has since appeared in the Latin American edition as the Pase Directo (following the change production companies in season three) and in the Norwegian version as the Fripass. For season 22, the leg 1 prize was two Express Passes; however, the team that won them could only use one of them and had to relinquish the second Express Pass to another team before the end of the fourth leg, and for season 23 and season 24 they need to relinquish the second Express Pass to another team before the end of the fifth leg. In season 25, the Express Pass was given out in an optional task right before the Pit Stop, allowing any team to possibly win it rather than it being a definite award for a first-place finish on the leg. In season 27, the team that won the Express Pass must use the Express Pass before the fifth leg and must give the Express Pass to another team at the leg after they use it, and the team who received the Express Pass must use the Express Pass on the next leg.|$|E
500|$|Kinnaird further delves {{into the}} ideas in Characters of Shakespear's Plays, {{especially}} that of [...] "power" [...] as involved in Shakespeare's plays and as investigated by Hazlitt, {{not only the}} power in physical force <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of imagination in sympathising with physical force, which at times can overcome our will to the good. He explores Hazlitt's accounts of Shakespeare's tragedies—Macbeth, Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and especially Coriolanus—where he shows that Hazlitt reveals that our love of power in sympathising with what can involve evil can overcome the human desire for the good. This, Kinnaird points out, has serious implications in considering the meaning and purpose of tragic literature in general.|$|E
