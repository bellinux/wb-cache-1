The structural and Complexity potential of such parts is very high but investments and variable costs are significant. A process offering an economic and flexible alternative is roll forming. In this paper, a simulation {{has been done in}} order to compare between roll forming and stamping <b>bumper</b> <b>beam.</b> CAD softwares have been used for the simulation and analysis which are Solidwork 2005 and finite element analysis software Algor version 21. The bumper beams have been design in Solidwork and the Algor has been used to make stress analysis to the bumper beams. The static stress with linear material model has been applied to the both bumper beams that are from stamping and roll forming for comparison. The surface loads that have been applied to the bumper beams are calculated from the velocity of Gen- 2 car at 80 km/h to 120 km/h. From the analysis the maximum stress for stamping <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> is 282. 82 MPa and 243. 29 MPa for roll forming <b>bumper</b> <b>beam.</b> After that, the analysis about costs to produce each <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> has been done.

40|$|The present thesis aims to {{establish}} a validated thermoelasto-thermoviscoplastic model and a failure criterion for several extruded anisotropic aluminium alloys.

The stress-strain behaviour and plastic anisotropy of the materials at {{a wide range of}} strain-rates were obtained through tensile tests. The dynamic fracture behaviour of the investigated alloys was investigated using an instrumented Charpy test machine and V-notch specimens. The numerical study was carried out with the non-linear finite element code LS-DYNA. Tensile tests at low to medium strain-rates were performed with a standard tensile test machine; while a split-Hopkinson tension bar (SHTB) was used to carry out tests at high rates of strain. Both fibrous and recrystallized extruded aluminium alloys have anisotropic mechanical properties. Tests were therefore done in three directions, i. e. 0 °, 45 ° and 90 °, with respect to the extrusion direction in order to characterize the plastic anisotropy of the extruded alloys. Fracture characteristics were obtained from measurements of the original area and fractured area of the gauge section. Based on the test results, an anisotropic thermoelastic-thermoviscoplastic constitutive relation and a simple fracture criterion were calibrated for the alloys and used in explicit finite element analyses of the SHTB tests for all four alloys. Using a combination of implicit and explicit solvers, the numerical predictions were found to represent the observed behaviour, including fracture, in the experimental tests fairly well. To investigate dynamic fracture, instrumented Charpy V-notch impact tests were conducted. For each alloy, the influence of orientation of the specimen with respect to the extrusion direction was investigated with the V-notch either parallel or normal to the thickness direction of the profile. Metallurgical studies were also carried out to investigate the physical mechanisms governing the macroscopic material behaviour. The experiments showed that the dissipated energy is practically invariant to specimen orientation and notch direction for the recrystallized alloy. For the fibrous alloys the dissipated energy decreases with increasing angle between the longitudinal direction of the specimen and the extrusion direction, i. e. the dissipated energy is lower when the notch is parallel to the fibrous grain structure. Finally, 3 D numerical analyses of the Charpy V-notch tests were carried out on AA 6060 -T 6 and AA 7003 -T 6 using LS-DYNA. The work hardening behaviour {{in the first part of}} the test was well predicted in the simulation, while the peak load was underestimated in almost all simulations.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{mechanical}} behavior of three selected steel materials which {{are considered to}} be the bulk material of front most <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> of a vehicle that is suddenly loaded in the quasi-static range. Thirty-six constant strain rate uniaxial tension tests were performed. The test was performed on a HUALONG electro-hydraulic universal testing machine at four strain rates (3. 33 × 10 - 3, 3. 33 × 10 - 2, 3. 33 × 10 - 1, 3. 33 s- 1). The FEM which is ABAQUS/CAE is used to simulate the bumper subsystem using the three selected steel. The outcome shows that ultimate tensile strength (UTS) increase with an increase in strain rate and high alloy steel (HAS) material has the maximum mean UTS. The FEM in the post -processing stage gives the minimum displacement and maximum strain energy for HAS material when compared to the other two materials. Finally, from both experimental and ABAQUS explicit analysis the result shows HAS material is better suit for the <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> application...|$|E

In this paper, we present an application of axiomatic design approach for product standardization, using the independence axiom. The automotive bumper system is chosen as a case study. The amount of energy absorbed by <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> and energy absorbing material (foam) during a 5 mph impact are the defining characteristics of bumper system. The two functional requirements that the bumper system design should satisfy are...|$|E
5000|$|The {{model name}} SV-1 was {{an acronym for}} [...] "safety vehicle one". The {{original}} idea for the Bricklin SV-1 was a safe and economical sports car, but due to the added weight of the safety features, the car was inefficient and simply a safe sports car. The Bricklin was designed for safety with an integrated roll cage, 5 mi/h km/h <b>bumpers,</b> and side <b>beams.</b> The body was fibreglass with bonded acrylic in five [...] "safety" [...] colours: white, red, green, orange and suntan. The cars had no cigarette lighters or ashtrays [...] "to discourage smoking". A non-smoker, Malcolm Bricklin believed it was unsafe to smoke and drive. The Bricklin is the only production vehicle in automotive history to have factory powered gull-wing doors that opened and closed {{at the touch of}} a button as standard equipment. (The later DeLorean DMC-12's gull-wing doors operate manually, and the Tesla Model X's rear doors are referred to as falcon-wing doors rather than gull-wing due to the extra hinge.) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} a Master of Science thesis in {{industrial}} design engineering at Luleå University of Technology. It was conducted by Zeinab Al-shatrawi and Erika Andersson in cooperation with Gestamp HardTech R&D in Luleå during the spring semester of 2016. Gestamp HardTech is a world leading company in the press-hardening technology. They manufactures and delivers car components such as side impact <b>beams,</b> <b>bumpers,</b> A-pillar and B-pillar. They also develop and manufacture the production tools for the components. Tool CAE-analysts at the Research and Development Center in Luleå develops components and tools. Their work consists of modelling and simulations {{in order to create}} forming specifications and tooling specifications for the products. The Tool CAE-analysts either uses the product development software NX or CATIA V 5. The Tool CAE-analysts that uses CATIA V 5 share a common CAD-method and uses automated features to speed up and structure their work. There are no common CAD-method or automated features in NX so each Tool CAE-analyst has created their individual CAD-method. The objectives in this project was to develop a new common CAD-method and to identify suitable features to automate that are beneficial for the Tool CAE-analysts that uses NX. The automations allows the product development software to create the work. The purposes of the new CAD-method and automations are to structure and standardize their work process. Standardization in their work can increase the quality, make their development process more time-efficient and facilitate their teamwork. The project started by studying the assignment and analyzing the background. This information was used to plan and structure the process. The project continued with a literature study that included studies of previous theses at Gestamp HardTech and studies of the areas industrial design engineering, method objectives, organizing tools in NX and automation tools in NX. The literature study continued throughout the whole project process. Tool CAE-analysts were observed and interviewed while they worked on projects. The purpose was to understand the context, the needs of the users and each Tool CAE-analysts CAD-method. The steps in the CAD-methods were represented in Hierarchal task analysis models in order to evaluate the different CAD-methods. The evaluation was intended to identify advantages, disadvantages and common denominators in their work. The project followed with brainstorming and future workshop sessions to create ideas for the common CAD-method and automations. The Tool CAE-analysts participated in the Workshop to share their ideas. The ideas were developed into a final draft of the CAD-method and a final list of automations. This thesis resulted in a first draft of a common CAD-method, a template with a standard setup of feature groups and a manual with instructions on how to follow the CAD-method. The project also resulted in a list with suggested automations to develop. The list included information on the purpose of every automation, the commands {{that can be used to}} create them and important parameters to take into consideration when creating the automations.
