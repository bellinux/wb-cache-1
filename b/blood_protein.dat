5|$|Any {{blood clot}} forms {{due to an}} {{imbalance}} between coagulation (the formation of the insoluble <b>blood</b> <b>protein</b> fibrin) and fibrinolysis. The three major mechanisms for such an imbalance are enumerated in Virchow's triad: alterations in normal blood flow, injury to the blood vessel wall, and alterations in the constitution of blood (hypercoagulability). Most cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are due to hypercoagulability.|$|E
5|$|Rhabdomyolysis {{may cause}} kidney failure by several mechanisms. The most {{important}} is the accumulation of myoglobin in the kidney tubules. Normally, the <b>blood</b> <b>protein</b> haptoglobin binds circulating myoglobin and other heme-containing substances, but in rhabdomyolysis the quantity of myoglobin exceeds the binding capacity of haptoglobin. Myoglobinuria, the presence of myoglobin in the urine, occurs when the level in plasma exceeds 0.5–1.5mg/dl; once plasma levels reach 100mg/dl, the concentration in the urine becomes sufficient {{for it to be}} visibly discolored and corresponds with the destruction of about 200grams of muscle. As the kidneys reabsorb more water from the , myoglobin interacts with Tamm–Horsfall protein in the nephron to form casts (solid aggregates) that obstruct the normal flow of fluid; the condition is worsened further by high levels of uric acid and acidification of the filtrate, which increase cast formation. Iron released from the heme generates reactive oxygen species, damaging the kidney cells. In addition to the myoglobinuria, two other mechanisms contribute to kidney impairment: low blood pressure leads to constriction of the blood vessels and therefore a relative lack of blood flow to the kidney, and finally uric acid may form crystals in the tubules of the kidneys, causing obstruction. Together, these processes lead to acute tubular necrosis, the destruction of the cells of tubules. Glomerular filtration rate falls and the kidney is unable to perform its normal excretory functions. This causes disruption of electrolyte regulation, leading to a further rise in potassium levels, and interferes with vitamin D processing, further worsening the low calcium levels.|$|E

50|$|Serum albumin {{accounts}} for 55% of <b>blood</b> <b>proteins,</b> {{and is a}} major contributor to maintaining the osmotic pressure of plasma to assist in the transport of lipids and steroid hormones. Globulins make up 38% of <b>blood</b> <b>proteins</b> and transport ions, hormones, and lipids assisting in immune function. Fibrinogen comprises 7% of blood proteins; conversion of fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin is essential for blood clotting. The remainder of the plasma proteins (1%) are regulatory proteins, such as enzymes, proenzymes, and hormones. All <b>blood</b> <b>proteins</b> are synthesized in liver except for the gamma globulins.|$|R
40|$|The oocytes of saturniid moths take up {{proteins}} selectively {{from the}} blood. The distribution of <b>blood</b> <b>proteins</b> in the ovary during protein uptake was investigated by staining 2 / ~ sections of freeze-dried ovaries with fluorescein-labeled antibodies. The {{results indicate that}} <b>blood</b> <b>proteins</b> occur primarily in the intercellular spaces of the follicle cell layer, in association with a brush border at {{the surface of the}} oocyte, and within the oocyte in the yolk spheres. That proteins derived from the blood are associated with the yolk spheres was confirmed by isolating these bodies and showing that lysis, which can be induced by any of a number of mechanical means, causes them to release immunologically defined proteins known to be derived from the blood. That the level of <b>blood</b> <b>proteins</b> in the cytoplasm is low relatively to that in the yolk spheres was confirmed by the observation that the yellow pigments associated with several <b>blood</b> <b>proteins,</b> although conspicuous in the yolk spheres, are not visible in the translucent layer of centrifuged oocytes. From these and previous physiological observations, it is proposed that <b>blood</b> <b>proteins</b> reach the surface of the oocyte by an intercellular route, that they combine with some component of the brush border...|$|R
25|$|The UD {{method is}} based on {{ultrasound}} indicator dilution.

Injection of body-temperature normal saline (ultrasound velocity of saline is 1533m/s) into a unique AV loop decreases blood ultrasound velocity, and produces dilution curves.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{involves}} {{administration of}} {{large volumes of}} intravenous fluids, which can become very costly. Antibiotics are often given if deemed appropriate based on the presumed underlying cause and the horse's CBC results. Therapy to help prevent endotoxemia and improve <b>blood</b> <b>protein</b> levels (plasma or synthetic colloid administration) may also be used if budgetary constraints allow. Other therapies include probiotics and anti-inflammatory medication. Horses that are not eating well may also require parenteral nutrition. Horses usually require 3–6 days of treatment before clinical signs improve.|$|E
25|$|Epilepsy is {{a common}} {{neurological}} disease that is characterized by recurrent and sometimes untreatable seizures. Several clinical and experimental data have implicated the failure of blood–brain barrier function in triggering chronic or acute seizures. Some studies implicate the interactions between a common <b>blood</b> <b>protein</b> (albumin) and astrocytes. These findings suggest that acute seizures are a predictable consequence of disruption of the BBB by either artificial or inflammatory mechanisms. In addition, expression of drug resistance molecules and transporters at the BBB are a significant mechanism of resistance to commonly used anti-epileptic drugs.|$|E

25|$|The {{causes of}} {{hyponatremia}} are typically classified by a person's body fluid status into low volume, normal volume, or high volume. Low volume hyponatremia can occur from diarrhea, vomiting, diuretics, and sweating. Normal volume hyponatremia {{is divided into}} cases with dilute urine and concentrated urine. Cases in which the urine is dilute include adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and drinking too much water or too much beer. Cases in which the urine is concentrated include syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). High volume hyponatremia can occur from heart failure, liver failure, and kidney failure. Conditions {{that can lead to}} falsely low sodium measurements include high <b>blood</b> <b>protein</b> levels such as in multiple myeloma, high blood fat levels, and high blood sugar.|$|E
25|$|Equine {{linkage group}} II {{includes}} {{a number of}} genes. The first linkage was found between a blood type marker and tobiano white spotting in 1978. The same blood type marker, albumin, was linked to another <b>blood</b> <b>protein</b> called vitamin D-binding protein. In 1982, a linkage grouping was proposed, including three genes for serum proteins, and three for coat color: tobiano spotting, chestnut, and roan. Research since equine linkage group II was defined has identified {{the exact location of}} the tobiano allele and the chestnut allele. The region of the chromosome that harbors the roan gene is homologous to parts of chromosomes in other species that also control coat color, even some similar to roan. Presently, the KIT gene is the primary candidate gene for roan. While a chromosomal inversion of KIT causes tobiano white spotting, KIT also harbors one or more alleles responsible for sabino spotting, no fewer than eleven alleles responsible for dominant white spotting, and is thought to be a major contributor to many other forms of less distinctive white markings.|$|E
25|$|Rapid venom {{evolution}} {{can also}} {{be explained by the}} arms race between venom targeted molecules in resistant predators, such as the opossum, and the snake venom that targets the molecules. Scientists performed experiments on the opossums and found that there were multiple trials that showed replacement to silent substitutions in the von Willebrand Factor (vWF) gene which encodes for a venom-targeted hemostatic <b>blood</b> <b>protein.</b> These substitutions are thought to weaken the connection between vWF and a toxic snake venom ligand (botrocetin) which changes the net charge and hydrophobicity. These results are significant to the venom evolution because it is the first citation of rapid evolution in a venom-targeted molecule. This shows that an evolutionary arms race may be occurring in terms of defensive purposes. Alternative hypotheses suggest that venom evolution is due to trophic adaption, whereas these scientist believe, in this case, that selection would occur on traits that help with prey survival in terms of venom evolution instead of predation success. Several other predators of the pit viper (mongooses and hedgehogs) show the same type of relationship between snakes, which helps to support the hypothesis that venom has a very strong defensive role along with a trophic role. Which in turn supports the idea that predation on the snakes can be the arms race that produces snake venom evolution.|$|E

2500|$|... α-Parinaric acid is {{also used}} as a {{chromophore}} to study interactions between membrane proteins and lipids. Because of the similarity of α-parinaric acid to normal membrane lipids, it has minimal perturbing influence. By measuring shifts in the absorption spectrum, enhancement of α-parinaric acid fluorescence, induced circular dichroism, and energy transfer between tryptophan amino acids in the protein and the bound chromophore, information may be gleaned about the molecular interactions between protein and lipid. For example, this technique is used to investigate how fatty acids bind to serum albumin (a highly abundant <b>blood</b> <b>protein),</b> lipid transport processes including structural characterization of lipoproteins, and phospholipid-transfer proteins.|$|E

5000|$|The large {{majority}} of oncotic pressure in capillaries is generated {{by the presence of}} high quantities of albumin, a protein that constitutes approximately 80% of the total oncotic pressure exerted by blood plasma on interstitial fluid. The total oncotic pressure of an average capillary is about 28 mmHg with albumin contributing approximately 22 mmHg of this oncotic pressure. Because <b>blood</b> <b>proteins</b> cannot escape through capillary endothelium, oncotic pressure of capillary beds tends to draw water into the vessels. It is necessary to understand the oncotic pressure as a balance; because the <b>blood</b> <b>proteins</b> reduce interior permeability, less plasma fluid can exit the vessel.|$|R

2500|$|Long-term {{control of}} blood sugar {{concentration}} {{can be measured}} by the concentration of Hb A1c. Measuring it directly would require many samples because blood sugar levels vary widely through the day. Hb A1c {{is the product of}} the irreversible reaction of hemoglobin A with glucose. A higher glucose concentration results in more Hb A1c. Because the reaction is slow, the Hb A1c proportion represents glucose level in blood averaged over the half-life of red blood cells, is typically 50–55 days. An Hb A1c proportion of 6.0% or less show good long-term glucose control, while values above 7.0% are elevated. This test is especially useful for diabetics. level is only useful in individuals who have red blood cells (RBCs) with normal survivals (i.e., normal half-life). In individuals with abnormal RBCs, whether due to abnormal hemoglobin molecules (such as Hemoglobin S in Sickle Cell Anemia) or RBC membrane defects – or other problems, the RBC half-life is frequently shortened. In these individuals, an alternative test called [...] "fructosamine level" [...] can be used. It measures the degree of glycation (glucose binding) to albumin, the most common <b>blood</b> <b>protein,</b> and reflects average blood glucose levels over the previous 18–21 days, which is the half-life of albumin molecules in the circulation.|$|E
