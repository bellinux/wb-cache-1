This article, dedicated to Professor Adolf Wagner, tries to differentiate three fields of research: Hypothesis formation in theory, characterisation of market imbalances and measurement of cycle and trend in empirical methods, short-term prognoses and turning point analyses in forecasting. Can we establish new hypotheses by considering expectations, gained from surveys? A special proposal aimed at the measure of the reference cycle by using the utilization of capacities in enterprises. It is evident, that when using <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>indicators</b> in business cycle research we can avoid the dichotomy between the three fields in business cycle research, which has been observed in the past.

However, the assessment of the <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> is not an easy endeavor as the cyclical component is not an observable variable. In this paper we resort to singular spectrum analysis in order to disentangle the US GDP into several underlying components of interest. The <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>indicator</b> yielded through this method is shown to bear a resemblance with band-pass filtered output. As the end-of-sample behavior is typically a thorny issue in <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> assessment, a real-time estimation exercise is here conducted to assess the reliability of the several filters.

40|$|The {{growth rate}} of {{temporary}} help service employment is often {{considered to be a}} leading <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>indicator</b> because the firing and hiring of temporary help workers typically lead that of permanent workers. However, few studies in the literature focus on the mechanism that generates the lag between temporary and permanent growth. This paper investigates how firms extract signals of long-lived shocks from noisy transitory shocks and how this influences their hiring/firing decisions. Our simple model predicts that the average size of transitory demand shocks increases the lag while the average size of long-lived shocks shortens the lag. Our empirical findings based on cross-city analysis show evidence that supports the above predictions, after controlling for city size, city-specific demographic characteristics, and variables based on the industry mix in the city.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} whether the dynamic {{properties of the}} U. S. <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> have {{changed in the last}} fifty years. For this purpose we develop a flexible <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>indicator</b> that is constructed from a moderate set of macroeconomic time series. The coincident economic indicator is based on a multivariate trend-cycle decomposition model that accounts for time variation in macroeconomic volatility, known as the great moderation. In particular, we consider an unobserved components time series model with a common cycle that is shared across different time series but adjusted for phase shift and amplitude. The extracted cycle can be interpreted {{as the result of a}} model-based bandpass filter and is designed to emphasize the <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> frequencies that are of interest to applied researchers and policymakers. Stochastic volatility processes and mixture distributions for the irregular components and the common cycle disturbances enable us to account for all the heteroskedasticity present in the data. The empirical results are based on a Bayesian analysis and show that time-varying volatility is only present in the a selection of idiosyncratic components while the coefficients driving the dynamic properties of the <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>indicator</b> have been stable over time in the last fifty years. ...|$|R

40|$|Forecasting the Quality Spread Using <b>Business</b> <b>Cycle</b> <b>Indicators</b> Extended Abstract Introduction The {{spread between}} yields on {{corporate}} bonds of differing quality {{is one of}} the most important measures of the aggregate level of credit risk in the economy and has been widely used as an indicator of overall economic activity and of stock prices. It has also assumed considerable importance in recent years as a fundamental determinant of the profitability of complex investment strategies that depend upon the convergence of yields on securities with differing credit risk. A good forecast of the quality spread is likely to be very useful both for economic forecasting and for investment management. In this paper we find a way to forecast the quality spread by utilizing the idea that the magnitude of the quality spread varies with fluctuations in overall economic activity and hence <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>indicators</b> are likely to contain information about the future evolution of the spread.

40|$|This paper compares two single-equation {{approaches}} {{from the}} recent nowcast literature: Mixed-data sampling (MIDAS) regressions and bridge equations. Both approach are used to nowcast a low-frequency variable such as quarterly GDP growth by higher-frequency <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>indicators.</b> Three differences between the approaches are discussed: 1) MIDAS is a direct multi-step nowcasting tool, whereas bridge equations are based on iterated forecasts; 2) MIDAS equations employ empirical weighting of high-frequency predictor observations with functional lag polynomials, whereas the weights of indicator observations in bridge equations are partly fixed stemming from time aggregation. 3) MIDAS equations can consider current-quarter leads of high-frequency indicators in the regression, whereas bridge equations typically do not. However, the conditioning set for nowcasting includes the most recent indicator observations in both approaches. To discuss {{the differences between the}} approaches in isolation, intermediate specifications between MIDAS and bridge equations are provided.

40|$|Recent finance {{research}} that draws on behavioral psychology suggests that investors sys-tematically make errors in forming expectations about asset returns. These errors {{are likely to}} cause significant mis-pricing in the short run, and the subsequent reversal of prices to their fundamental level implies that measures of investor sentiment {{are likely to be}} correlated with stock returns.
