5|$|HMS Neptune {{was laid}} down in 1873 for the Brazilian Navy {{under the name of}} Independencia by J & W Dudgeon in Cubitt Town, London. The {{shipyard}} attempted to launch her on 16 July 1874, but she stuck fast and did not budge. A second attempt was made on 30 July during which the ship got about one-third down the slipway and stuck, extensively damaging her <b>bottom</b> <b>plating.</b> She was finally launched on 10 September, after she had been lightened, and she was towed to Samuda Brothers for repairs and fitting out. The cost of the accident resulted in the bankruptcy of Dudgeons in 1875.|$|E
5|$|Rusalka, {{named after}} the mythological creature, was ordered on 25 January 1865 and {{construction}} began on 10 June at the Admiralty Shipyard, Saint Petersburg, although the formal keel-laying was not until 6 June 1866. She was launched on 12 September 1867 and completed in 1869 {{at the cost of}} 762,000 rubles. Construction was considerably delayed by late deliveries of drawings, material, and the death of her original builder. The ship struck an uncharted rock off the Finnish coast in June 1869 and damaged her <b>bottom</b> <b>plating</b> badly enough that she had to be run aground to prevent her from sinking. Rusalka served her entire career with the Baltic Fleet and was assigned to the Artillery Training Detachment in March 1870. The ship had her boilers replaced in 1878 and 1891 and she was reclassified as a coast-defense ironclad on 13 February 1892.|$|E
25|$|When the Cabinet of Finland allotted {{two million}} Finnish markkas for the {{restoration}} of the old icebreaker, Tarmo was towed to Kotka in November 1990. After her interiors had been extensively documented and photographed, all fittings and furnishing were removed and stored ashore. When Tarmo was drydocked for inspection, her <b>bottom</b> <b>plating</b> was found out to be in surprisingly good condition. The deteriorated weather decks and aftship cabins were completely rebuilt.|$|E

40|$|A WIG(Wing-In-Ground effect) craft flies {{close to}} the water surface by {{utilizing}} a cushion of relatively high pressurized air between its wing and water surface. This implies that when one designs such craft {{it is important to}} have lightweight structures with adequate strength to resist external loads with some margins. To investigate this requirement, this paper deals with the structural analysis of the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> of small WIG craft having a design landing weight of 1. 2 -ton. As building materials for the WIG craft, pre-preg carbon/epoxy composites are considered. The strength information of the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> is obtained using the first-ply-failure analysis in conjunction with a mid-plane symmetric laminated plate theory. As a result, the first-ply-failure location, load and deflection of the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> are obtained. The calculated strength information is compared with the water reaction load for the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> of seaplanes considered when they land on the water surface –the same fluid-structure interaction mechanism as that of WIG craft. In the calculation of seaplane water reaction load information, the rules shown in FAR(Federal Aviation Regulations) Part 25 are used. Through the comparison, the structural integrity of the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> for the WIG craft is checked...|$|R
25|$|Based on signals {{given by}} the trapped crew members and {{information}} received from {{the representative of the}} shipping company and the technical director of the shipyard, two members of the LEKA team make a hole to the <b>bottom</b> <b>plating</b> with a gasoline-powered cutter while the divers held them in place with safety ropes. When the hull was breached, the overpressure inside was released and the steel plate was thrown in the air. After having been rescued the crew members were flown to the local hospital.|$|E
25|$|After {{having been}} {{handed over to}} the Finnish Navy, Oldenburg was towed to Uusikaupunki for refitting. The work, which began in late 1930 and {{continued}} until November 1931, included replacing part of the <b>bottom</b> <b>plating,</b> building an additional tweendeck, refurbishing the rigging, painting the whole ship and rebuilding her cargo holds to accommodate up to 180 men. The shipyard was responsible for the structural alterations while 62 future crew members and cadets of the Finnish Navy were responsible for the other tasks, including carrying 1,200 tons of stones to the ship as sailing ballast.|$|E
25|$|Neptun began {{salvaging}} the grounded Sampo in May 1940 by emptying {{the coal}} storages and melting the ice masses inside the vessel with steam. The icebreaker was towed to Turku in June because the longer distance to Helsinki was deemed too risky — large stones had wedged between the mangled <b>bottom</b> <b>plating,</b> and had they fallen during the transit, Sampo would have {{filled with water}} and sunk. The icebreaker arrived in Turku on the Midsummer Eve of 1940 and after emergency repairs was towed to Hietalahti shipyard in Helsinki, where it remained for extensive repairs until 13 March 1941.|$|E

40|$|The cross-corrugated heaters {{consist of}} a wavelike {{absorbing}} plate and a wavelike <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> which are crosswise positioned to form the air flow channel. Two types of these heaters are considered. For the type 1 heater, the wavelike shape of the absorbing plate is along the flow direction {{and that of the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> is perpendicular to the flow direction, while for the type 2 heater it is the wavelike shape of the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> that is along the flow direction and that of the absorbing plate is perpendicular to the flow direction. The aims of the use of the cross-corrugated absorbing <b>plate</b> and <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> is to enhance the turbulence and the heat-transfer rate inside the air flow channel, which are crucial to the improvement of efficiencies of solar air-heaters. To quantify the achievable improvements with the cross-corrugated absorbing and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates,</b> flat-plate solar air-heaters which have both a flat absorbing plate and a flat <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> are also considered. The thermal performance of these three types of solar air-heaters are analyzed, measured and compared under several configurations and operating conditions. All the analytical and experimental results show that, although the thermal performance of the type 2 heater is just slightly superior to that of the type 1 heater, both of these cross-corrugated solar air-heaters have a much superior thermal performances to that of the flat-plate one. It is also found that the use of selected coatings on the absorbing plates of all the heaters considered can substantially enhance the thermal performances of the heaters, whereas such a selected coating on the <b>bottom</b> <b>plates</b> or/and the glass covers does not have such a significant effect on the thermal performances of the heaters.

25|$|In May 1908, Tarmo {{was sent}} {{for the first}} time to the Bothnian Bay to open the harbors and fairways for the spring. On 2 June, she was run hard aground near Raahe due to an error by a pilot when {{navigating}} by sight, resulting in extensive damage to the <b>bottom</b> <b>plating</b> and a lost propeller blade. Kept afloat by her own pumps, she returned to Raahe for emergency repairs and continued to Helsinki, where she was drydocked from 7 June until early August. In 1912 she was again run aground near Hanko, but the damage was not as extensive as on the first time.|$|E
25|$|The {{rebuilding}} {{and expanding}} of the Finnish icebreaker fleet continued until all Finnish ports could be kept open year-round. In the late 1970s, the first post-war icebreakers were approaching either mid-life update or retirement. As a result, the 25-year-old Voima was extensively rebuilt by Wärtsilä Helsinki Shipyard in 1978–1979 {{at a cost}} of about FIM 86 million, 60% of the price of a new icebreaker of comparable size. In the refit, Voima received new hull plating and additional ice-strengthening, new main engines and a completely new superstructure to accommodate the crew, and her propulsion motors and electrical systems were completely refurbished. After the refit, Voima was practically a new ship with only web frames, <b>bottom</b> <b>plating,</b> forepeak and propellers remaining from the original ship and, at 14,000 shaft horsepower, the third most powerful icebreaker of Finland at the time. She returned to service on 10 October 1979.|$|E
500|$|Asahi, meaning [...] "rising sun", {{a poetic}} name for Japan from a stanza of waka poetry, was laid down on 1 August 1898 in Clydebank, Scotland, by the Clydebank Engineering & Shipbuilding Co. and {{completed}} by John Brown & Company, which purchased the firm before Asahi was completed. She was launched on 13 March 1899 and completed on 31 July 1900. Her completion was delayed by {{about three months}} when her <b>bottom</b> <b>plating</b> required repairs after running aground off Southsea following sea trials. The ship departed England, after repairs in Portsmouth, {{on the day of}} her completion, and arrived at Yokosuka, Japan, on 23 October 1900. Asahi became flagship of the Standing Fleet on 22 May 1901 and was assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet when the Combined Fleet was re-formed on 28 December 1903.|$|E

500|$|Lion was {{temporarily}} repaired at Rosyth with timber and concrete before sailing to Newcastle upon Tyne to be repaired by Palmers; the Admiralty {{did not wish}} it known that she was damaged badly enough to require repair at either Portsmouth or Devonport Dockyards lest that {{be seen as a}} sign of defeat. She was heeled 8° to starboard with four cofferdams in place between 9 February and 28 March to repair about [...] of <b>bottom</b> <b>plating</b> and replace five armour plates and their supporting structure. She rejoined the Battlecruiser Fleet, again as Beatty's flagship, on 7 April. She had fired 243 rounds from her main guns, but had only made four hits: one each on Blücher and Derfflinger, and two on Seydlitz. In return she had been hit by the Germans sixteen times, but only suffered one man killed and twenty wounded.|$|E
500|$|On 19 April 1910, Collingwood was {{commissioned}} and {{assigned to the}} 1st Division of the Home Fleet {{under the command of}} Captain William Pakenham. She joined other members of the fleet in regular peacetime exercises, and on 11 February 1911 damaged her <b>bottom</b> <b>plating</b> on an uncharted rock off Ferrol. On 24 June the ship was present at the Coronation Fleet Review for King George V at Spithead. Pakenham was relieved by Captain Charles Vaughan-Lee on 1 December. On 1 May 1912, the 1st Division was renamed the 1st Battle Squadron. On 22 June, Vaughan-Lee was transferred to the battleship [...] and Captain James Ley assumed command; Vice-Admiral Stanley Colville hoisted his flag in Collingwood as commander of the 1st Battle Squadron. The ship participated in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead before beginning a refit late in the year. In March 1913, Collingwood and the 1st Battle Squadron undertook a port visit to Cherbourg, France. Midshipman Prince Albert (later King George VI) was assigned to the ship on 15 September 1913. Collingwood hosted Albert's older brother, Edward, Prince of Wales, during a short cruise on 18 April 1914. She became a private ship when Colville hauled down his flag on 22 June.|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} parametric {{study has}} been carried out in this paper on the thermal performance of cross-corrugated solar air collectors. These collectors consists of a wavelike absorbing plate and a wavelike <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> which are crosswise positioned to form the air flow channel. Two types of these collectors are considered. For the Type 1 collector, the wavelike shape of the absorbing plate is along the flow direction and that of the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> is perpendicular to the flow direction, while for the Type 2 collector it is the wavelike shape of the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> that is along the flow direction and that of the absorbing plate is perpendicular to the flow direction. The aim of the use of the cross-corrugated absorbing <b>plate</b> and <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> is to enhance the turbulence and the heat transfer rate inside the air flow channel which are crucial to the improvement of efficiencies of solar air collectors. To quantify the achievable improvements with the cross-corrugated absorbing and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates,</b> a flat-plate solar air collector which has both a flat absorbing plate and a flat <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> is also considered. The thermal performance of these three types of solar air collector are analyzed and compared under various configurations and operating conditions. The results show that although the thermal performance of the Type 2 collector is just slightly superior to that of the Type 1 collector both of these cross-corrugated solar air collectors have a significantly superior thermal performance to that of the flat-plate one. It is also found that to achieve a higher collector efficiency, it is essential to construct the collectors having slender configurations along the air flow direction, to maintain a small mean gap between the absorbing <b>plate</b> and <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> to use selected coatings on the absorbing plate and glass cover, to maintain a higher air mass flow rate, and to operate the collectors with the inlet fluid temperature close to that of the ambient fluid...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the thermal}} {{performance}} of cross-corrugated and v-groove solar air collectors {{has been compared}} under {{a wide range of}} configuration and operating conditions. For cross-corrugated collectors, the air flow channel is formed by the wavelike absorbing plate and the wavelike <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> which are transversely positioned, whereas for v-groove collectors it is formed by the v-groove absorbing plate and the flat <b>bottom</b> <b>plate.</b> The use of the transversely positioned wavelike <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> in cross-corrugated collectors is to achieve better thermal performance by enhancing the heat transfer rate inside the air flow channel via augmented turbulence. It is found that cross-corrugated collectors are superior to v-groove ones for all the configurations and operating conditions considered, confirming that the use of the transversely positioned wavelike <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> in cross-corrugated collectors improves the thermal performance. The results also show that a slender configuration along the air flow direction, a small gap between the absorbing <b>plate</b> and the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> a selected coating on the absorbing plate and the glass cover that has a very high absorptivity of solar radiation but quite a small emissivity of thermal radiation, an air mass flow rate per unit area of collector above 0. 1 kg/m 2 ·s, and maintaining the inlet fluid temperature close to that of the ambient fluid, will lead to improved thermal performance for both collectors. However, it is found that the mean gap between the cover and the absorbing plates, thexemissivity of thermal radiation of the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> the solar insolation, and the inclination of the collectors have negligible effects on the efficiencies of both collectors...|$|R

40|$|A single film (typical {{of a film}} in a foam) {{moving in}} a {{confined}} geometry (i. e. confined between closely spaced top and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates)</b> is analysed via the viscous froth model. In the first instance the film {{is considered to be}} straight (as viewed from above the top plate) but is not flat. Instead it is curved (with a circular arc cross-section) in the direction across the confining plates. This curvature leads to a maximal possible steady propagation velocity for the film, which is characterised by the curved film meeting the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates</b> tangentially. Next the film is considered to propagate in a channel (i. e. between top and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates</b> and sidewalls, with the sidewall separation exceeding that of the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates).</b> The film is now curved along as well as across the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates.</b> Curvature along the plates arises from viscous drag forces on the channel sidewall boundaries. The maximum steady propagation velocity is unchanged, but can now also be associated with films meeting channel sidewalls tangentially, a situation which should be readily observable if the film is viewed from above the top plate. Observed from above, however, the film need not appear as an arc of a circle. Instead the film may be relatively straight along much of its length, with curvature pushed into boundary layers at the sidewalls...|$|R
