40|$|The study {{focuses on}} {{incidents}} at Department of Energy (DOE) facilities involving {{the migration of}} radioactive contaminants through protective clothing. The authors analyzed 68 occurrence reports for the following factors: (1) type of work; (2) working conditions; (3) type of anti-contamination (anti-C) material; (4) area of body or clothing contaminated; and (5) nature of spread of contamination. A majority of reports identified strenuous work activities such as maintenance, construction, or decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) projects. The reports also indicated adverse working conditions that included hot and humid or cramped work environments. The type of anti-C clothing most often identified was cotton or water-resistant, disposable clothing. Most of the reports also indicated contaminants migrating through perspiration-soaked areas, typically in the knees and forearms. On {{the basis of their}} survey, the authors recommend the use of improved engineering controls and resilient, <b>breathable,</b> <b>waterproof</b> protective <b>clothing</b> for work in hot, humid, or damp areas where the possibility of prolonged contact with contamination cannot be easily avoided or controlled...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} <b>waterproof</b> <b>breathable</b> <b>clothing</b> has {{steadily}} been increaseing {{over the past}} two decades. The technology for developing <b>waterproof</b> <b>breathable</b> textiles is focussed around two key aspects: The polymer membrane that is laminated onto the fabric to render it <b>waterproof</b> and <b>breathable</b> and the lamination technology with allows the proper adhesion of the membrane and fabric. Numerous breakthroughts have been made {{over the past two}} decades with regard to the development of new polymer membranes for clothing lamination. These membranes are however patent protected and expensive. This disseratation examines the use of starch as a modifying agent for the development of cheaper membranes that can act as an import replacement for the South African clothing lamination industryDissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009.

50|$|Modern raincoats {{are often}} {{constructed}} of <b>breathable,</b> <b>waterproof</b> fabrics such as Gore-Tex or Tyvek and coated nylons. These fabrics allow some air to pass through, allowing the garment to 'breathe' so that sweat vapour can escape.

In 1980 the company's <b>breathable,</b> <b>waterproof</b> fabric system, called Helly Tech, was launched. Helly Tech garments use both hydrophilic and microporous technology. Hydrophilic garments have water-loving molecular chains which pass water vapor to the outside. Microporous garments have tiny pores that allow water vapor to pass out of the fabric without letting rain droplets in.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, Polartec {{launched}} a <b>waterproof</b> <b>breathable</b> fabric called Polartec NeoShell.

40|$|Radiation {{workers at}} all US Department of Energy (DOE) sites require {{some form of}} {{protective}} clothing when performing radiological work. A large number of contaminated facilities at DOE site are currently or will eventually undergo some form of decontamination and decommissioning (D&D), requiring some type of protective clothing, often in multiple layers. Protective clothing that does not allow perspiration to escape causes heat stress, which lowers worker comfort and productivity. This report describes the NuFab{trademark} anti-contamination. The suit is a one-piece, disposable, <b>breathable,</b> <b>waterproof</b> coverall with a single front zipper. Constructed of tri-laminated composite material using spun-bonded polypropylene and microporous film layers, the suit is certified as incineratorable...|$|R

50|$|Rubber {{was also}} widely used for waterproofs {{during the nineteenth}} century and {{although}} not breathable was highly versatile and widely used. In 1823 Charles Macintosh patented a double textured fabric sandwiched around a layer of rubber. The Mackintosh became the synonym for the rain coat. Improved Macintosh was extremely versatile and was developed for fashionable wear and sporting activity and was made by numerous Manchester manufacturers. Other waterproof and wind proof fabrics, such as Burberry, Grenfell and Ventile were developed from the late nineteenth century. By the early 1960s wartime-developed materials including Nylon and PVC had come to the commercial market in volume. The development of synthetic polymers innovation began in the 1920s gathering pace during and after the Second World War, though it took time for light, <b>breathable</b> <b>waterproofs</b> to be developed.|$|R
5000|$|Most [...] are {{constructed}} of leather, sometimes with a <b>breathable</b> <b>waterproof</b> lining, such as Gore-Tex. However, the shoes are not comparable to rubber boots {{when it comes}} to being waterproof and drying quickly, making it difficult to cross rivers while keeping the inside of the boot dry. Although there are rubber lace-up boots designed for hiking purposes, rubber hiking boots are not ideal for extensive use because the feet cannot breathe and sweat extensively, which can lead to foot problems such as blisters, fungal infections and trench foot. These drawbacks negate any advantage rubber boots have in keeping out external moisture. However non-rubber hiking boots are generally quite expensive and require more care. The largest hiking boot is 7.14m long, 2.5m wide, and 4.2m tall by Schuh Marke (Germany).|$|R
50|$|It is far {{harder than}} the more popular Balinese climb up Gunung Batur.

A dawn arrival at the top is recommended {{in order to avoid}} clouds that typically cover the top from approximately 9 a.m. onwards. There is no water available along the route.|$|R
5000|$|Windstopper is {{a fabric}} {{laminate}} made by W. L. Gore & Associates. It {{is similar to}} Gore-Tex, except {{that it is only}} windproof and <b>breathable,</b> not <b>waterproof.</b> One of the most common applications is a lamination with Polar fleece, since the lack of wind resistance is one of the principal drawbacks of that fabric.|$|R
50|$|In 1852 S.W.Silver and Co {{moved to}} the area from Greenwich and {{established}} a rubber works, originally to make <b>waterproof</b> <b>clothing.</b> This subsequently developed into {{the works of the}} India Rubber, Gutta Percha and Telegraph Cable Company, which constructed and laid many submarine cables. By the 1860s a number of manure and chemical works and petroleum storage depots had been set up. In 1864, the area became an ecclesiastical parish of its own, centred on the church of St Mark's.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the PLCE webbing system is to retain {{the means by which}} a British soldier may operate for 48 hours or conduct a mission-specific task.

25|$|The castle may be {{approached}} from two directions. From Llangollen the path starts from Canal Bridge and runs beside Ysgol Dinas BrÃ¢n.

The other route starts from 'Offa's Dyke Path' on the north {{western side of the}} hill. This route is shorter but steeper. Official advice is to equip yourself with stout walking shoes and warm, <b>waterproof</b> <b>clothing</b> before climbing to the castle.|$|R
