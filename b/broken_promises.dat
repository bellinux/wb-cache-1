5|$|In 1848, Wisconsin {{achieved}} statehood; Indian {{nations were}} under increased pressure for removal and marginalization. Corrupt US Indian agents controlled annuity payments, sometimes underpaying tribes, and took authority not granted {{them by the}} bands. They allowed white settlers to move onto Ojibwa lands and refused the Ojibwe the rights reserved by treaties. The Ojibwa complained to the President about the mistreatment and <b>broken</b> <b>promises,</b> but politicians were more apt to listen to western land speculators, who saw possibilities for profit in removing the Ojibwa to Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|The first Polish {{communist}} government, the Polish Committee of National Liberation, {{formed in}} July 1944, declined to accept jurisdiction over Home Army soldiers, therefore {{for over a}} year Soviet agencies such as the NKVD took responsibility for disarming the Home Army. By war's end, some 60,000 Home Army soldiers had been arrested, 50,000 of whom were deported to Soviet Gulags and prisons; most of these soldiers had been taken captive by the Soviets during, or in the aftermath of, Operation Tempest, when many Home Army units tried to work together with the Soviets in a nationwide uprising against the Germans. Other Home Army veterans were arrested when they approached Polish communist government officials after having been promised amnesty. After a number of such <b>broken</b> <b>promises</b> during {{the first few years of}} communist control, Home Army soldiers stopped trusting the government.|$|E

5|$|Dunn's second World Grand Champion was RPM, {{a son of}} Dark Spirit's Rebel. Dunn showed RPM to a Three-Year-Old World Championship in 1997. In 1998, RPM and Dunn won the Four-Year-Old World Championship {{and then}} placed second in the World Grand Championship; the latter {{achievement}} made them the Reserve World Grand Champions. Dunn had hopes of winning first the next year. In May 1999 the horse was sold to L R & N Partners, LLC for $1.25 million. The new owners moved RPM to trainer Sammy Day's stable in Shelbyville, {{with the intention of}} entering him in the Celebration. Shortly before the Celebration, Day was convicted of bribing a judge, fined, and put on a five-year suspension. Dunn was given the task of riding RPM in the show, and won the World Grand Championship. Dunn was 81, again making him the oldest rider ever to win the class, breaking his earlier record. At the same show, Steve Dunn rode Out on Parole to a Two-Year-Old World Championship, and another Dunn-trained horse, <b>Broken</b> <b>Promises,</b> won the Four-Year-Old World Championship.|$|E

25|$|The AFL pushed back. On April 1, 1919, {{thousands}} of miners in Pennsylvania {{went on strike}} to demand that local officials allow union meetings. Terrified town mayors soon issued the required permits. The mass meetings whipped up pro-union sentiment.

In an effort to increase attendance, Kwariani had Sammartino wrestle his tag team partner Antonino Rocca twice during this time. Sammartino was then told by Rudy Miller to jump back to McMahon.|$|E

25|$|Characterisation {{is one of}} the {{key element}} in demarcating the choice of law and {{jurisdiction}} issues.Once the forum court decides that it has jurisdiction to hear the case, it must characterise or classify the cause(s) of action.

25|$|Other {{veterans}} {{were arrested}} {{when they decided}} to approach the communist authorities after being promised amnesty. In 1947, the government of the People's Republic of Poland proclaimed an amnesty for most of the wartime resistance fighters. The authorities expected around 12,000 people to give up their arms, but the actual number of partisans {{to come out of the}} forests eventually reached 53,000. Many of them were arrested despite promises of freedom; and after repeated <b>broken</b> <b>promises</b> during the first few years of communist rule, former AK members refused to trust the government.|$|E
25|$|Despite highly popular measures, {{such as the}} {{nationalization}} of the holdings of the Gulf Oil Company, Ovando failed to gain popular support. Popular enthusiasm over the nationalization was short lived. Disagreement over compensation, a boycott of Bolivian crude oil on the international market, and a general downturn in the economy became divisive factors. Even though Ovando legalized the COB and withdrew troops from the mining camps, lasting worker support for the regime was not ensured. Frustrated expectations, <b>broken</b> <b>promises,</b> and the massacre of miners by the military in Catavi in 1967 had radicalized the workers, who now refused {{to cooperate with the}} military government.|$|E

25|$|After {{numerous}} attempts {{to convince him}} to start a serious rehab, in early 2005 Doherty's father decided {{he was tired of}} <b>broken</b> <b>promises</b> and vowed not to see his son again until he was clean of drugs. The sensitivity surrounding the issue became apparent in the BBC Two Arena documentary about Doherty, on 12 November 2006, which included footage of him talking about this aspect of his personal life. He was visibly upset and had to politely ask the interviewer at one point to stop filming. In October 2007, Doherty explained {{in an interview with the}} BBC Radio 4 show Front Row that he had briefly reconciled with his father after three years when his father visited him in rehab, but were estranged again over drugs.|$|E
25|$|Hart {{was furious}} over the {{official}} decision and argued with the officials {{claiming that he}} should be declared the winner and not Austin.

He demanded that he receive the title shot that the winner of the Royal Rumble is entitled to, saying that as far as he was concerned he won the match. McMahon simply ignored him and walked to his broadcast position, and an incensed Hart finally decided he had had enough and declared he was quitting the WWF.|$|E
25|$|Charles XII of Sweden succeeded Charles XI of Sweden in 1697, aged 14. From his predecessor, he {{took over}} the Swedish Empire as an {{absolute}} monarch. Charles XI had tried to keep the empire out of wars, and concentrated on inner reforms such as reduction and allotment, which had strengthened the monarch's status and the empire's military abilities. Charles XII refrained from all kinds of luxury and alcohol and usage of the French language, since he considered these things decadent and superfluous. He preferred the life of an ordinary soldier on horseback, not that of contemporary baroque courts. He determinedly pursued his goal of dethroning his adversaries, whom he considered unworthy of their thrones due to <b>broken</b> <b>promises,</b> thereby refusing to take several chances to make peace. During the war, the most important Swedish commanders besides Charles XII were his close friend Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld, also Magnus Stenbock and Adam Ludwig Lewenhaupt.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{disagreements}} over {{money and the}} management of the band, the Runaways and Kim Fowley parted ways in 1977. The group quickly hired new management, Toby Mamis, who also worked for Blondie and Suzi Quatro. When the group split with Fowley, they also parted with their record label Mercury/Polygram, to which their deal was tied. In the Edgeplay documentary, members of the group (especially Fox and Currie) as well as the parents of Currie and West, have accused Fowley, and others assigned to look after the band, of <b>broken</b> <b>promises</b> as to schooling and other care, using divide and conquer tactics to keep control of the band, along with the verbal taunting of band members. The band reportedly spent much time enjoying the excesses of the rock 'n' roll lifestyle during this time.
