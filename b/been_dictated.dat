5|$|At {{the same}} time there was a change in castle architecture. Until the late 12thcentury castles {{generally}} had few towers; a gateway with few defensive features such as arrowslits or a portcullis; a great keep or donjon, usually square and without arrowslits; and the shape would have <b>been</b> <b>dictated</b> by {{the lay of the land}} (the result was often irregular or curvilinear structures). The design of castles was not uniform, but these were features that could be found in a typical castle in the mid-12thcentury. By the end of the 12thcentury or the early 13thcentury, a newly constructed castle could be expected to be polygonal in shape, with towers at the corners to provide enfilading fire for the walls. The towers would have protruded from the walls and featured arrowslits on each level to allow archers to target anyone nearing or at the curtain wall.|$|E

Pads, made of cork, became available {{for the first time in}} 1841, and these were further developed following the invention of vulcanised rubber, which was also used to introduce protective gloves in 1848. In the 1870s, boundaries were introduced – previously, all hits had to be run; if the ball went into the crowd, the spectators would clear a way for the fieldsman to fetch it. The biggest change, however, was in how the ball was delivered by the bowler.|$|E

25|$|In the Primary Chronicle, {{the account}} of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the {{so-called}} Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' (Chersonesus) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have <b>been</b> <b>dictated</b> by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised {{the hand of the}} emperor's sister, Anna Porphyrogenita. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kiev), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law. The sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Greek princess. The alleged place of Vladimir's baptism in Chersonesos is marked by St. Vladimir's Cathedral.|$|E
25|$|Gustav Bauer {{was forced}} to sign the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, even though he {{disagreed}} with it. The treaty had <b>been</b> <b>dictated</b> by the victorious Allies of World War I; it forced Germany to assume sole responsibility for the war, reduced the area of Germany and imposed reparation payments and military restrictions on the nation. In early 1919, {{the strength of the}} Reichswehr, the regular German army, was estimated at 350,000, with more than 250,000 men enlisted in the various Freikorps (free corps), volunteer paramilitary units, largely consisting of returning soldiers from the war. The German government had repeatedly used Freikorp troops to put down Communist uprisings after the war. Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which came into effect on 10 January 1920, Germany was required to reduce its land forces to a maximum of 100,000 men. The initial deadline was set for 31 March 1920 (later extended {{to the end of the}} year).|$|E

In a television appearance, Nunn displayed {{a copy of the}} order and declared [...] "My first act will be to abolish this." [...] The New Republic accused him of conducting [...] "the first outright segregationist campaign in Kentucky".

500|$|Although he was {{the subject}} of severe {{criticism}} by Bonaparte, historian William Laird Clowes, writing in 1900, considered that Ganteaume had done well to prevent his squadron being overwhelmed by the British, particularly during the attempt to land at Benghazi when he almost suffered a repeat of the situation at the Nile in 1798, with his ships anchored close inshore as a British fleet bore down on them. This precarious position, described by Clowes as a [...] "mad idea", was not one of Ganteaume's choosing: it had <b>been</b> <b>dictated</b> by Bonaparte before he departed Toulon for the second time. Clowes considered that Ganteaume's [...] "caution was, after all, less dangerous to his country than the rash and infatuated naval strategy of his master". Ganteaume did not hold another sea command, but was made commander of the Mediterranean and governor of Toulon following the Peace of Amiens in March 1802.|$|E
500|$|After the war, some of {{the leading}} cast members were brought to trial {{as part of the}} denazification process. They {{generally}} defended their participation in the film {{on the grounds that they}} had only done so under duress. Despite significant evidence to support their arguments, Susan Tegel, author of Nazis and the Cinema, characterizes their postwar attempts to distance themselves from the film as [...] "crass and self-serving". However, she concedes that their motives for accepting the roles seem to have been more driven by opportunistic ambition than by antisemitism. Veit Harlan was the only major movie director of the Third Reich to stand trial for [...] "crimes against humanity". After three trials, Harlan was given a light sentence because he convinced the courts that the antisemitic content of the film had <b>been</b> <b>dictated</b> by Goebbels and that Harlan had worked to moderate the antisemitism. Eventually, Harlan was reinstated as a citizen of the Federal Republic of Germany and went on to make nine more films. He remained a controversial figure and the target of protests.|$|E

500|$|The {{choice of}} [...] gun and {{the mix of}} quadruple and twin turrets for the main battery of the King George Vs had <b>been</b> <b>dictated</b> by the Second London Naval Treaty, which limited battleships to [...] {{standard}} displacement and a main calibre of 14inches. The treaty was meant to prevent a costly naval arms race that Britain could ill afford. However, when the Japanese Government refused to agree to its terms, the maximum calibre allowed reverted to 16inches in April 1937. The Board of Admiralty then began preliminary design work on a 35,000-ton ship armed with 16-inch guns and they were promising enough that the Director of Naval Construction (DNC) was ordered to further investigate such designs, providing for several aircraft as well. To save design time, many {{of the features of}} the King George Vs were incorporated in the new design, but the limited size of the ship was a real challenge for the designers. In order to maintain the same speed, protection, and secondary armament as the preceding King George Vs while using 16 inch guns, the design displacement rose to 41,000-tons, mainly due to the increased weight of the main armament. Hoping to remain within treaty limits, the increased weight of the main armament was compensated for by a slight reduction in the overall weight of armour and the elimination of two twin [...] gun turrets.|$|E
500|$|The {{nature and}} {{position}} of Gibraltar's defences have <b>been</b> <b>dictated</b> by the territory's topography. It is a long, narrow peninsula measuring [...] by [...] wide at maximum, with a land area of about [...] The only land {{access to the}} peninsula is via a sandy isthmus, only [...] above sea level, most of which is now occupied by the Spanish town of La Línea de la Concepción.

The Rock extends southwards for [...] with several peaks before it descends to two southern plateaus at heights of between [...] and [...] above sea level. The southern tip of Gibraltar is surrounded by steep cliffs. The Rock itself is asymmetric, with a moderate slope on the west side and a very steep (and in places near-vertical) slope on the east side. The original core of the town of Gibraltar occupies the lower north-west side of the Rock, adjoining the Bay of Gibraltar, though it has grown considerably {{to the point that the}} built-up area now stretches all the way to Europa Point on the southern tip of the peninsula. A great deal of 20th century land reclamation on the west side has also widened the coastal area, which was formerly quite narrow. A couple of small settlements, originally fishing villages, occupy the east side.|$|E
500|$|Munsey's {{plan for}} the {{magazines}} was {{laid out in a}} note that appeared in the first four issues: [...] "This magazine is the answer to thousands of requests we have received over a period of years, demanding a second look at famous fantasies which, since their original publication, have become accepted classics. [...] Our choice has <b>been</b> <b>dictated</b> by your requests and our firm belief that these are the aces of imaginative fiction." [...] The first issue included Ray Cummings' [...] "The Girl in the Golden Atom" [...] and A. Merritt's [...] "The Moon Pool", both popular stories by well-known authors. [...] Merritt's sequel, [...] "The Conquest of the Moon Pool", began serialization in the next issue, with illustrations by Virgil Finlay. [...] Finlay did many illustrations for Famous Fantastic Mysteries over its lifetime, and became one of its most popular artists. [...] Frank R. Paul began illustrating for the magazine with the third issue; he was not as capable an artist as Finlay but was very popular with the readers. [...] The first five covers were simply tables of contents, but with the sixth issue, dated March 1940, pictorial covers began, with Finlay the artist for that first cover. [...] Three early covers in 1940 were painted by Paul, but thereafter almost every cover was painted by either Finlay, Lawrence Stevens, or his son, Peter Stevens, including every single issue from February 1941 through April 1950. [...] The high quality of the artwork helped make the magazine {{one of the most popular}} of its day, and sf historian Thomas Clareson has suggested that it was Finlay's work in Famous Fantastic Mysteries and Fantastic Novels that made his reputation.|$|E

2500|$|This, however, {{proved to}} be the start of a series of {{disastrous}} miscalculations by Honecker. There were rowdy scenes across East Germany as furious East Germans who had paid in advance for their plane or train tickets and accommodation found that they could not travel and that their hard-earned money had been lost. The 14,000East German refugees camping in the grounds of the West German embassy in Prague had to be dealt with; Honecker sought to humiliate them publicly by expelling them through East Germany to the West, shipping them in eight sealed trains from Prague and stripping them of their East German citizenship while branding them as [...] "traitors". The Party justified the evacuation of the refugees as a humanitarian action taken because children were involved, who had been [...] "let down by the irresponsible actions of their parents." [...] The state newspaper Neues Deutschland ran an editorial, said to have <b>been</b> <b>dictated</b> by Honecker personally, which declared that [...] "by their behaviour they have trampled on all moral values and excluded themselves from our society." [...] Far from discrediting the refugees, the trains produced uproar, with citizens waving and cheering the refugees as they passed through the East German countryside. Torn-up identity papers and East German passports littered the tracks as the refugees threw them out of the windows. When the trains arrived in Dresden, 1,500East Germans stormed the main railway station in an attempt to board the trains. Dozens were injured and the station concourse was virtually destroyed.|$|E
2500|$|Smith {{attempted}} to place his depleted platoons into a defendable position, yet D Company's location had <b>been</b> <b>dictated</b> {{by the actions}} of the Viet Cong and the need to care for the wounded, and as a result they had little choice of where to make their stand. However, with the Australians occupying a shallow fold in the ground on a reverse slope the terrain proved decisive. Against this position the Viet Cong found it difficult to use their heavy calibre weapons effectively and could only engage at close range. Meanwhile, the jungle covered Nui Dat 2 feature lay [...] to the north-east, while an impenetrable wall of thick bamboo and scrub abutted the lower slopes to its west, following the northern edge of the rubber plantation [...] from D Company's position, running north-east to west. In contrast, the remainder of the position faced the relatively open rubber plantation. Believing the northern approach unsuitable for a major assault, Smith assessed the most likely Viet Cong course of action to be a frontal assault from the east, or a flanking attack from either the south or south-west. As a consequence he placed 10 and 12 Platoons in positions on the southern and eastern flanks, while the badly mauled 11 Platoon was allocated a position to the north-west. Company Headquarters was located in the south-west. During the lull Smith walked around the position to gain an understanding of the situation and check the wounded. With one platoon almost destroyed, and the other two at approximately 75 percent strength, D Company had been battered but morale remained high. While Smith tied in the platoons, Kirby completed the distribution of ammunition and Stanley plotted new defensive fire tasks for the artillery.|$|E
2500|$|The {{campaign}} by the annexationists against Bethmann Hollweg was {{in large part}} motivated {{by the fact that}} the annexationists believed that Bethmann Hollweg was not one of them. Had Chamberlain or any of the other annexationists been aware of the secret September Programme of 1914, where Bethmann Hollweg planned to announce his intentions for annexing much of Europe and Africa after the soon to be expected fall of Paris, they would have had a different opinion of Bethmann Hollweg. Under the constitution of 1871, the Reichstag had limited powers, but one of those was the right to vote on the budget. In the 1912 Reichstag elections, the anti-militarist Social Democrats had won the largest number of seats in the Reichstag. Thus Bethmann Hollweg had to work with the SPD to get the budgets passed to finance the war. In August 1914, the government had been able to persuade the majority of the SPD to support the war under the grounds that Russia was supposedly about to attack Germany. The SPD broke into two; the Majority Social Democrats supported the war while the minority Independent Social Democrats stayed true to their pacifistic beliefs and opposed the war. The Majority Social Democrats agreed to support the war to the extent it was portrayed as a defensive struggle against Russia, but the Majority SPD wanted nothing to do with the annexationists. [...] Hence, Bethmann Hollweg's refusal to support the annexationists in public was due to pragmatic political considerations, namely his need for Majority Social Democratic co-operation in the Reichstag as opposed to being against the annexationists as Chamberlain mistakenly believed. If the parties supporting annexationists such as the Conservatives, National Liberals and Free Conservatives had done better in the 1912 elections instead as poorly as they did, Bethmann Hollweg would almost certainly had taken a different line in public regarding the demands of the annexationists. Much of Chamberlain's strident, aggressive and embittered rhetoric reflected the fact that the annexationists were a minority in Germany, albeit a vocal, well organised and large minority with many influential members inside and outside the government, but a minority nonetheless. The majority of the German people did not support the annexationists. Chamberlain regarded the refusal of the democratic parties like the left-wing SPD, the right-of-the-centre Zentrum and the liberal Progressives to join the annexationist movement as essentially high treason. In August 1916, there occurred what amounted to a military coup d'état when Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff informed Wilhelm and Bethmann Hollweg that henceforward the Army would not longer obey either the Kaiser or the government, and that from now the Emperor and the Chancellor would now obey the Army. In July 1917 Hindenburg and Ludendorff had Bethmann Hollweg dismissed and replaced with Georg Michaelis as Chancellor. Chamberlain's preferred candidate as Chancellor, Admiral Tirpitz, was passed over. Tirpitz was an intelligent, media-savvy, charismatic political intriguer with a desperate hunger for political power, and the duumvirate of Hindenburg and Ludendorff regarded Tirpitz as Chancellor as too much of a threat to their own power. In response to the firing of Bethmann Hollweg, the democratic parties decided to protest by passing a peace resolution. The Reichstag Peace Resolution of July 1917, where the SPD, Zentrum and the Progressives all joined forces to vote for a resolution asking the government to start peace talks at once on the basis of a return to the status quo of 1914, [...] "inflamed the paranoia and desperation of the right. The annexationists prepared for a war to the knife against the Chancellor and domestic [...] "traitors"". Chamberlain was disappointed that Tirpitz was not appointed Chancellor; however, he was overjoyed with Bethmann Hollweg's sacking, and welcomed the military dictatorship of Hindenburg and Ludendorff as giving Germany the sort of government it needed. Chamberlain was always inclined to hero worship, and for him, Hindenburg and Ludendorff were the greatest of a long line of German heroes. Chamberlain wrote in 1917 that: [...] "Had Hindenburg and Ludendorff stood on the first day in their rightful place, the peace would in all probability have <b>been</b> <b>dictated</b> in Paris before the end of 1914".|$|E
