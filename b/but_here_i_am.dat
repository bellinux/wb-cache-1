2500|$|Tunstall {{released}} her fifth album, KIN, on 9 September 2016. The album {{was produced by}} Tony Hoffer, and recorded in Los Angeles.. Three singles were released from this album : the lead single Maybe It's A Good Thing, then, Hard Girls in which Melanie C from the Spice Girls made an appearance, and It Took Me So Long to Get Here, <b>But</b> <b>Here</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|Love {{made several}} {{responses}} to the rumors, first in 1998: [...] "All this time I have never addressed this. <b>But</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> finally saying {{for the very first}} time that Kurt did not [...] Live Through This. I mean for fuck's sake, his skills were much better than mine at the timethe songs would have been much better. That's the first thing." [...] Love later addressed the issue, stating: [...] "I wanted to be better than Kurt. I was really competing with Kurt. And that's why it always offends me when people would say, [...] "Oh, he wrote Live Through This." [...] I'd be proud as hell to say that he wrote something on it, but I wouldn't let him. It was too Yoko [...] for me. It's like, [...] "No fucking way, man! I've got a good band, I don't fucking need your help." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't like it," [...] Sheldon assured her. [...] "To {{save my life}} I can't {{imagine how}} I ever came here. <b>But</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> and I can't run away." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> firm. [...] "No," [...] I said, very decisively, [...] "simply I won't stand that. It's {{a matter}} of conscience. I shouldn't feel--democratic. I'll take my chance of the common water in the carafe on the chairman's table." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{set out to}} see the lumber-camp, and {{although}} I stepped forth boldly, {{the truth was that}} with all my love for the Wild West I would have liked to <b>be</b> at home. <b>But</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> and <b>I</b> determined not to show the white feather.|$|R
3000|$|... “I {{felt a bit}} shy and {{uneasy about}} being present “out in the open.” But I joined the hangout, asked my {{questions}} to Dr. C… and it <b>was</b> great. <b>I</b> just can’t describe the experience here. My experience in Turkish schools taught me to follow hierarchy and build it, even if doesn’t impose any structures on me. <b>But</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> talking to somebody influential in the field, asking some basic questions and getting answers.” (Koseoglu, 2015, {{a graduate student at}} the time).|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{shall see}} about that. <b>But</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> again, at any rate. The {{mischief}} take them for interfering old fools! When they had got me {{they had nothing}} to say against me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{looks to}} me like a giveaway; [...] <b>But</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> and here I'll stay. [...] The country's pink, but we'll all be blue [...] When Trot goes home as she says she'll do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come! {{make things}} easy to me, and I'm yours. I don't know that I {{may not be}} better off here, after all, than if I had gone away this morning. <b>But</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> and here I'll stay now. Take your oath!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} thought of it before. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> busy, and the years have passed. <b>But</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> see--It <b>is</b> a new generation, Cossar, and new {{emotions}} and new needs. All this, Cossar--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you mean}} when <b>am</b> <b>I</b> going to kill you," [...] replied the bandit, [...] "why, there ain't no {{particular}} rush about it. I'm a tender-hearted chap, <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> <b>I</b> never {{should have been in}} this business at all, <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>be,</b> and as there ain't nobody that {{can do a better job}} of the kind than me, or do it so painlessly, why I just got to do it myself, and that's all there is to it. But, as I says, there ain't no great rush. If you want to pray, why, go ahead and pray. I'll wait for you." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “My {{heart and}} my {{thoughts}} were always on Niue. <b>But</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> living in Aotearoa on someone elses land. Writing helped change me, painting helped change me. I {{went back to}} Niue as often as I could, and Id weed and clear the graves for {{my family and friends}} families. Its a way of saying Im back. ... We go back home Niue with our Nikes and our jeans and we think we know things. But the local people just think were stupid. They know where all the trees are and the pathways and where the mythologies and the stories live." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would if}} I {{should not be}} a tie and hindrance. No, I must not do that; <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> Colin, here I am. And it is all true--it has all come right at last! All we waited for. Nothing has ever been like this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sometimes," [...] {{admitted}} the Sea Horse, [...] "and {{there are many}} other living things that have a way of destroying us. <b>But</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> as you see, over six weeks old, and during that time I have escaped every danger. That isn't so bad, is it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and a whole}} hatful. I couldn't {{get back}} over the high pass. Had to go round by Lost Lake, and to cap all, Old Baldy took a notion not to lead. Oh, I've had a peach of a time; <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> Have you seen Moore and his party?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Previews {{for four}} of the tracks on One-X were able to be found on Three Days Grace's Online Trading Cards. Tracks that could be previewed were [...] "It's All Over", [...] "Pain", [...] "Never Too Late" [...] and [...] "Over and Over". Adam Gontier wrote many of these songs during {{rehabilitation}} after being addicted to OxyContin (oxycodone), a pain killer. [...] "Usually we all sit as a group, hanging out, working together, <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just alone, writing about how I felt," [...] as Adam Gontier said in his docu-drama about his experience, Behind The Pain.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> again mistaken; for Mehevi, in {{conducting}} his warlike operations, rather inclined to the Fabian {{than to the}} Buonapartean tactics, husbanding his resources and exposing his troops to no unnecessary hazards. The total loss of the victors in this obstinately contested affair was,—in killed, wounded, and missing—one forefinger {{and part of a}} thumb-nail (which the late proprietor brought along with him in his hand), a severely contused arm, and a considerable effusion of blood flowing from the thigh of a chief who had received an ugly thrust from a Happar spear. What the enemy had suffered I could not discover, but I presume they had succeeded in taking off with them the bodies of their slain.|$|R
6000|$|... "A prisoner, yes. A slave, yes--a mummified man; a dead {{thing with}} life enough to work, {{but not yet}} quite a brute, more's the pity, for then I should not care! <b>But</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> for twelve years--long, long years! It has seemed to me an eternity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could get}} out of my business. Judas, but I get tired of it! When I left the farm I never s'posed I'd find myself nailed down to the floor of a barber-shop, <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> and making good money. How'd you like to go on a ranch?" [...] he asked, meaningly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tut, tut!" [...] {{cried the}} clergyman, in a boisterous voice, {{which could not}} cover the despondency of his expression; [...] "you thought, no doubt, {{that it was all}} over with me, <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in spite of it. Never lose heart, Mrs. Belmont. Your husband's {{position}} could not possibly be as hopeless as mine was." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Poor devil, I {{dare say}} {{he has had a}} bad time. But I was a fool not to draw out of that. It was all very well when I was a bachelor. <b>But</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> as a married man faced with an {{indefinite}} liability and nothing to meet it with. I don't know what is to become of us, Maude.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Pierre {{asserts that}} of the {{following}} years, nine were spent in a drug-induced haze, culminating with a stay in Australia where he finally collapsed. He described this period {{of his life in}} an interview given on the Australian television show Enough Rope with Andrew Denton in 2006: [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> lucky enough to be in Australia at the time, having come back to try my luck. The support network was fantastic. There's immediately the safety net under you here, which, {{in the rest of the}} world I wouldn't have survived, definitely. <b>But,</b> <b>here,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> taken into therapy, where they told me that ... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in the grip of bad psychology, and that this rabbit was never going to come out of the hat and I should get used to the idea, which <b>was</b> what <b>I</b> needed at the time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word, you are {{becoming}} despotic in your sickness, and you forget {{that it is}} but a short time since I came down from a journey to the sky, and that my poor bones are still tender. <b>But</b> <b>here</b> goes. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> born to <b>be</b> victimised, so <b>I</b> submit to the decrees of Fate." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{doubt if}} Lady Drew and the Olympians did {{that sort of}} thing, <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> may <b>be</b> only {{clinging}} to another of my former illusions about aristocracy and the State. Perhaps always possessions have been Booty, and never anywhere has there been {{such a thing as}} house and furnishings native and natural to the women and men who made use of them....|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't think I claim any right," [...] said Fitzpiers, sadly. [...] "It {{is for you}} to do and {{say what}} you choose. I admit, quite as much as you feel, that I am a vagabond--a brute--not worthy to possess the {{smallest}} fragment of you. <b>But</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> and I have happened to take sufficient interest in you to make that inquiry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I had no {{complaint}} coming. Think of {{the others}} in that car--all dead. Unfortunately, I was riding on a pass, and so could not sue the railroad company. <b>But</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> the only man who ever dived ninety feet into eighteen inches of water and lived to tell the tale.--Steward, if you don't mind replenishing my glass [...] " ...|$|E
60|$|On the homeward voyage, the {{fourteen}} youths and damsels were in excellent spirits, {{as you will}} easily suppose. They {{spent most of their}} time in dancing, unless when the sidelong breeze made the deck slope too much. In due season, they came within sight of the coast of Attica, which was their native country. <b>But</b> <b>here,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> grieved to tell you, happened a sad misfortune.|$|E
6000|$|Winston {{shook his}} head. [...] "I'm afraid you must stay <b>here,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> will <b>be</b> back with Colonel Barrington {{in a few}} hours at latest." ...|$|R
6000|$|Chris Allonby chuckled. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "we haven't {{the least}} use for Larry <b>here,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> almost proud {{he was a}} friend of mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's it!" [...] says Tony. [...] "Nothing {{has been}} the matter. <b>But</b> <b>here</b> have <b>I</b> <b>been</b> stewing and fuming in this jolly old crib till I have had the horrors falling on me as thick as hail. THERE'S a blessed-looking candle!" [...] says Tony, {{pointing}} to the heavily burning taper on his table with a great cabbage head and a long winding-sheet.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{of another}} world," [...] I answered, [...] "the great planet Earth, which {{revolves}} about our common sun and next within {{the orbit of}} your Barsoom, which we know as Mars. How I came here I cannot tell you, for I do not know; <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> and since my presence has permitted me to serve Dejah Thoris I am glad that I am here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{on account}} of the lease"--cried Mr. Newcome, a little too hastily, possibly, for the credit of his discretion--"how did I know when it would run out? Your gran'ther granted it for three lives, and twenty-one years afterward, and I did all a man could to make it last as long as I should myself; <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> in the prime of life, and in danger of losing my property!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{might have}} smelt a rat! I {{always knew that}} this would be the danger." [...] He changed {{suddenly}} to a confidential tone, fixing his sepulchral stare on Heyst. [...] "And yet here I am, taken in by the fellow, like the veriest fool. I've been always on the watch for some beastly influence, <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> fairly caught. He shaved himself {{right in front of me}} and I never guessed!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>but</b> look <b>here,</b> Bone; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just {{thinking}} about it, that's all. You're always drumming it into me about not taking anything for granted. Anyway, by the time I go to Plato I'll know----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Howdy, Miss Helen? Howdy, Bo?" [...] he said. [...] "You all {{both look}} fine an' brown.... <b>I</b> reckon <b>I</b> <b>was</b> shore slow rustlin' your uncle Al up <b>here.</b> <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> figgerin' you'd like Milt's camp for a while." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You don't live <b>here.</b> <b>But</b> as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> saying--if {{we get rid}} of the Japs to-day, we'll be told to get rid of {{some one}} else to-morrow. There's no limit, sir, to what Labour wants. None!' ...|$|R
