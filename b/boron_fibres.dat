40|$|The {{structure}} of noncrystalline, chemically vapour-deposited <b>boron</b> <b>fibres</b> was investigated by computer modelling the experimentally obtained X-ray diffraction patterns. The diffraction patterns from the models were computed using the Debye scattering equation. The modelling was done utilizing the minimum nearest-neighbour distance, {{the density of}} the model, and the broadening and relative intensity of the various peaks as boundary conditions. The results suggest that the fibres consist of a continuous network of randomly oriented regions of local atomic order, about 2 nm in diameter, containing boron atoms arranged in icosahedra. Approximately half of these regions have a tetragonal structure and the remaining half a distorted rhombohedral structure. The model also indicates the presence of many partial icosahedra and loose atoms not associated with any icosahedra. The partial icosahedra and loose atoms indicated in the present model are in agreement with the relaxing sub-units which have been suggested to explain the anelastic behavior of fibre boron and the loosely bound boron atoms which have been postulated to explain the strengthening mechanism in <b>boron</b> <b>fibres</b> during thermal treatment...|$|E

The anisotropy of the CTE was measured and found to be very large for specimens unidirectionally reinforced with carbon fibre. Relaxation of stresses due to the different thermal expansion of matrix and reinforcement was studied by using the bending of asymmetrically reinforced samples and the magnitude of the stresses evaluated using bending beam theory...|$|E
40|$|The {{fracture}} of 6061 aluminium alloy reinforced with unidirectional and cross-plied 0 / 90 deg, 0 / 90 /+ or - 45 deg <b>boron</b> <b>fibres</b> has been investigated. The {{results have been}} {{described in terms of}} a critical stress intensity, K(Q). Critical stress intensity factors were obtained by substituting the failure stress and the initial crack length into the appropriate expression for K(Q). Values were obtained that depended on the dimensions of the specimens. It was therefore concluded that, for the size of specimen tested, the values of K(Q) did not reflect any basic materials property...|$|E

Hewitt and Howald {{were the first to}} come up with a way to lay the fibers into the shape of a fishing rod by wrapping them around a piece of balsa wood. However, by 1977, <b>boron</b> <b>fibre</b> technology had been muscled out by the cheaper material graphite and was no longer competitive in the market.|$|R
40|$|Commercial grade <b>Boron</b> nitride <b>fibres</b> of tensile {{strength}} 13; 115 x 10 psi and tensile modulus 6 x 10 psi were prepared. The preparation of <b>Boron</b> nitride <b>fibres</b> involve three important steps: (1) preparation of Boric Oxide fibre (a precursor material) by directly drawing the fibers from the melt {{in a continuous}} form, (ii) Partial nitriding of the Boric Oxide fibres in an ammonia atmosphere under controlled conditions of heating in a batch process upto 1050 xB 0;C.

40|$|Nowadays, {{composite}} {{components and}} reinforcements {{are widely used}} in aircraft repair technology, since they present more efficient performance than conventional repairs. Composite patches (carbon or <b>boron</b> <b>fibres)</b> {{have been used for}} many years, mainly for research purposes, in aircraft maintenance. This move towards composites is mainly because of the increased mechanical performance, less corrosion and fatigue problems, allowing for longer service life of the aircraft. In this work, the technology and use of composite patching was described and reviewed. Furthermore, since the detection of structures integrity under patch, during the service life of aircraft, by non-destructive means is considered of great importance, infrared thermography was used for the detection of simulated artificially introduced damages - cracks, on the surface of Al 2024 -T 3 aircraft skin panels under composite patching or simulated delaminations between two plies of composite patches. Finally, real-time monitoring of damage during fatigue loading using thermography was also discussed and attempted in the laboratory on aircraft repaired panels. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to the prediction of the layer longitudinal compression strength of continuous fibre polymer matrix composites. It is known that failure is caused by fibre microbuckling and that the initial fibre waviness and the matrix non-linear behaviour play a major role. A previous model compared very well with experimental results, but required a relatively complex numerical solution procedure. In the present model, the compression strength is obtained by solving a fourth-order polynomial equation. Although based on several simplifying assumptions, the model is in good agreement with the numerical model predictions and with experimental data. Further model simplifications lead to a closed-form expression that seems to be valid for carbon and <b>boron</b> <b>fibre</b> composites...|$|R
40|$|Materials {{scientists}} {{express their}} interest in metal-matrix composites (MMC) {{in order to reach}} a higher level of properties which could open new horizons of applications substituting conventional materials. Next to carbon the <b>boron</b> <b>fibre</b> became available at first and was usedas a reinforcement of structural parts in the US Space Shuttle. During the last 10 years silicon carbide and alumina fibres drew attentionand became more attractive from the technical and economic point of view. Today we are at the edge of high volume applications in connection with light metals like aluminium as matrix. Industry changed the direction of development to discontinuous reinforcements like particles, short fibres and whiskers. Although the strength of MMC using such reinforcements is inferiour to those with continuous fibres, they have the advantage of being cheaper, mechanical working is possible and the properties are more isotropic...|$|R
40|$|The white beam (∼ 6 – 80 keV) {{available}} at the TopoTomo X-ray beamline of the ANKA synchrotron facility (KIT, Karlsruhe, Germany) was used to perform edge-enhancement imaging tests on lithium fluoride radiation detectors. The diffracted X-ray image of a microscopic <b>boron</b> <b>fibre,</b> consisting of tungsten wire wrapped by boron cladding, was projected onto lithium fluoride thin films placed at several distances, from contact to 1 m. X-ray photons cause the local formation of primary and aggregate colour centres in lithium fluoride; these latter, once illuminated under blue light, luminesce forming visible-light patterns—acquired by a confocal laser scanning microscope—that reproduce {{the intensity of the}} X-ray diffracted images. The tests demonstrated the excellent performances of lithium fluoride films as radiation detectors at the investigated photon energies.

The FBG is subjected to temperature variation using an oven. The Bragg wavelength shift with temperature variation is mostly due to thermo­optic effects.

40|$|AbstractThe {{global burden}} of enteric {{dysfunction}} and diarrhoeal disease remains a formidable problem that requires novel interventions. This {{study investigated the}} immune-modulatory capacity of bran across rice varieties with phytochemical differences. 129 SvEvTac mice were fed a 10 % rice bran or control diet followed by infection with Salmonella enterica. Faecal shedding titres were quantified and flow cytometry was used to investigate intestinal immunity. The largest protection against Salmonella colonization was observed with IAC 600 variety. Reduced faecal shedding correlated with increased levels of <b>boron,</b> soluble <b>fibre,</b> vitamin E isomers, and fatty acids. IAC 600 and Red Wells rice bran modulated small intestinal neutrophils, macrophages, interdigitating dendritic cells, CD 8 +, γδ, and regulatory T cells, as well as CD 8 + and γδ T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes. Rice bran is a promising functional food and merits evaluation {{for the prevention of}} Salmonella colonization and regulation of intestinal immunity in people...|$|R

The products {{were characterized by}} X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) absorption spectroscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed that BN fibers were mainly hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) with diameters of 5 - 8 µm and the major compositions of BN fibers are B and N with a very small amount of O and C. At last, the chemical composition of samples were determined by the chemical analysis test method like GB/T 16555 - 2008 and GJB 507 - 1998...|$|R
40|$|In general, fibres {{designed}} for use in telecommunications systems are not sufficiently photosensitive to allow 'strong' fibre gratings to be written. This {{has led to the}} search for other silica-based fibres which exhibit enhanced photosensitivity without the need for hydrogen-loading, the <b>boron</b> co-doped germania <b>fibre</b> being perhaps the best known example. In addition, it is sometimes necessary to exclude dopants such as germania from the core as they would interfere with other desirable properties of the fibre. Prime examples are the rare-earth doped fibre laser and erbium-doped fibre amplifier, devices which may require low concentrations of germania in order to function properly. This paper will cover some of the advances that have been made in searching for new materials. the problems which have been overcome, and those which remai...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The literature relating to the laser welding {{of a number of}} alloys was studied, this revealed gaps in the current state of knowledge. It was found that no indepth parametric or inicrostructural investigations had been carried out into the laser welding of non-ferrous alloys. Although problems associated with the laser welding of aluminium alloys had been identified, there was little in the literature to suggest an indepth study into the effect of surface modifications in enhancing the laser weldability of this material had been carried out. The laser welding of aluminium based metal matrix composites has also yet to be studied in detail. A programme was therefore set up to carry out an indepth investigation into the laser welding of a number of alloys namely; Nimonics C 263, and PE 11, aluminium 6061, and aluminium 6061 based <b>boron</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced, and silicon carbide particulate reinforced metal matrix composites. The study was aimed at developing an understanding of the microstructural effects of the laser welding process on the alloys, and assessing the structural integrity of the resultant welds. The effect of laser processing parameters such as laser power, laser beam traverse speed, lens focal length, and the manipulation of these parameters on the welding efficiency and weld area integrity was also investigated. Other tasks within the project included a study on the possibility of using an anodic film to enhance the laser weldability of Al 6061. Finally attempts were made to identify novel phases observed in the weld area of the composite materials. Nimonics C 263, and PEll exhibited laser welds free of cracks and porosity. The difference in composition between the two alloys did not result in any significant dissimilarities in their response to the laser welding process. The welds in both alloys exhibited a fine columnar dendritic microstructure, and while carbides were observed in the interdendritic regions of the welds, electron optical analysis did not reveal any y precipitates in this region. It was concluded that for the welding of thin gauge materials above a threshold laser power the resultant welding efficiency shows a greater dependence on laser beam mode, and laser spot size, than on laser power, and beam traverse speed. Aluminium 6061 was not easily welded with a laser in its as received form, and the welds showed some degree of porosity. Anodising was found to improve the welding efficiency in this material. While the presence of an anodic film on the metal surface increased the welding efficiency of the alloy, no relationship was found between the thickness of the anodic film and welding efficiency in the range of film thicknesses investigated in this work. Weld regions were observed to be cellular dendritic in structure, with narrow heat affected zones. No precipitates or low melting point phases could be identified in the weld region. Melt zones were successfully produced in the composite materials, with the main problem encountered being that of porosity adjacent to the weld bead. It was shown that manipulation of the laser welding parameters resulted in a decrease in this porosity. In the weld beads, a number of novel phases were observed. These were identified with the aid of TEM, and SIMS analysis techniques...|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of classes of indoor free flight models. Some are scale reproductions but others are {{designed}} purely to fly for as long as possible. These models are timed with a stopwatch.The FAI is the international organising body for all air sports worldwide, including aeromodelling. The FAI sanctions World and European Championships for the ultimate indoor duration class designated F1D. F1D models must have a minimum weight of 1.4 grams and a maximum wing span of 55 cm. These models are constructed from very light balsawood sheet and strip, <b>boron</b> filament, carbon <b>fibre,</b> and a transparent covering of plastic film less than 0.5 micrometres thick. The models are powered by 0.4 grams of rubber in a single loop about 9.0 inches long that can be wound to take around 1500 turns. The average propeller RPM during a flight is less than 50 and these models fly at less than walking pace. F1D models require a large space, such as a sports hall, aircraft or dirigible hangar, with the famous atrium of the West Baden Springs Hotel having been previously used for indoor free flight competitions in the United States, and there is even a salt mine in Romania 400 ft underground that has hosted the FAI world F1D championships several times. Single flight times approach forty minutes.|$|R
