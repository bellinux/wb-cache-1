500|$|Latin American {{literature}} scholar, Jacqueline Stefanko, {{along with}} several of her peers, has made pointed mention of the significant implications Yolanda’s multiple nicknames hold for her fragile and fragmented sense of self. Stefanko observes that [...] "as Yolanda's names proliferate on the page, we <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> multiplicity of her identity [...] realize the struggle Yolanda must engage in to not be fragmented {{in a society that}} marginalizes her". Scholar William Luis reinforces the notion that Yolanda’s shattered identity stems largely from the [...] "multiple names used [...] She is Yolanda, Yoyo, Yosita, Yo and, last but not least the English Joe. And above all, she is 'Yo,' the Spanish first person pronoun, the 'I' of the narrator." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Sonnet 1, we <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> [...] "love story" [...] {{between the}} fair youth (beloved) {{and the speaker}} (lover) unfold, though not the typical [...] "love story" [...] of the Elizabethan era if read this way. However, each of Shakespeare's sonnets can still be read as {{separate}} from the other sonnets. In this sonnet, the speaker engages in an argument with the beloved/fair youth about procreation: [...] "An agon, a dramatic struggle, develops between the speaker and the youth". Scholar Helen Vendler sums up Sonnet 1: [...] "The different rhetorical moments of this sonnet (generalizing reflection, reproach, injunction, prophecy) are permeable to one another's metaphors, so that the rose of philosophical reflection yields the bud of direct address, and the famine of address yields the glutton who, in epigram, eats the world's due".|$|E
2500|$|The servus callidus {{functions}} as the exposition {{in many of}} Plautus' plays. According to C. Stace, [...] "slaves in Plautus account for almost twice as much monologue as any other character... {{this is a significant}} statistic; most of the monologues being, as they are, for purposes of humor, moralizing, or exposition of some kind, we can now <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> true nature of the slave's importance." [...] Because humor, vulgarity, and [...] "incongruity" [...] are {{so much a part of}} the Plautine comedies, the slave becomes the essential tool to connect the audience to the joke through his monologue and direct connection to the audience. He is, then, not only a source for exposition and understanding, but connection—specifically, connection to the humor of the play, the playfulness of the play. The servus callidus is a character that, as McCarthy says, [...] "draws the complete attention of the audience, and, according to C. Stace, 'despite his lies and abuse, claims our complete sympathy'". He does this, according to some scholarship, using monologue, the imperative mood and alliteration—all of which are specific and effective linguistic tools in both writing and speaking.|$|E

Collective ownership is the necessary corollary of collective responsibility. There are to be no private land owners, no private bankers and lenders of money, no private insurance adventurers, no private railway owners nor shipping owners, no private mine owners, oil kings, silver kings, coal and wheat forestallers or the like. All this realm of property is to be resumed by the State, is to be State-owned and State-managed, and the vast revenues that are now devoted to private ends will go steadily to feed, maintain and educate a new and better generation, to promote research and advance science, to build new houses, develop fresh resources, plant, plan, beautify and reconstruct the world.|$|E
