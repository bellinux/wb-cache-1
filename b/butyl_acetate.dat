25|$|Overexposure to {{ethyl acetate}} may cause {{irritation}} of the eyes, nose, and throat. Severe overexposure may cause weakness, drowsiness, and unconsciousness. Humans {{exposed to a}} concentration of 400ppm in 1.4mg/L ethyl acetate {{for a short time}} were affected by nose and throat irritation. Ethyl acetate is an irritant of the conjunctiva and mucous membrane of the respiratory tract. Animal experiments have shown that, at very high concentrations, the ester has central nervous system depressant and lethal effects; at concentrations of 20,000 to 43,000ppm (2.0–4.3%), there may be pulmonary edema with hemorrhages, symptoms of central nervous system depression, secondary anemia and liver damage. In humans, concentrations of 400ppm cause irritation of the nose and pharynx; cases have also been known of irritation of the conjunctiva with temporary opacity of the cornea. In rare cases exposure may cause sensitization of the mucous membrane and eruptions of the skin. The irritant effect of ethyl acetate is weaker than that of propyl acetate or <b>butyl</b> <b>acetate.</b>|$|E

The ions were created using corona discharge at atmospheric pressure and separated in a drift tube before analysis of the ions by mass spectrometry. At the ambient operational temperature and pressure used in our instrument, all acetates studied formed dimers. Using a homolog series of n-alkyl-acetates, we found that the collision cross section of a dimer was smaller than that of a monomer with the same reduced mass. Our experiments also showed that the reduced mobility of acetate dimers with different functional groups increased in the order n-alkyl ≤ branched chain alkyl ≤ cyclo alkyl < aromat. For mixed n-alkyl dimers we found that the reduced mobility of acetate dimers having the same number of carbons, for example a dimer of acetyl acetate and hexyl acetate has the same reduced mobility as a dimer composed of two <b>butyl</b> <b>acetates.</b> The fundamental behavior of acetate monomers and dimers described in this paper will assist in {{a better understanding of the}} influence of dimer formation in ion mobility spectrometry...|$|R

This residue was then washed with distilled water until a neutral pH was realised with the waste water, dried and redissolved in DCM at 1 - 2 w/w% to create a processable blend barrier polymer solution. The final sensor design utilised 125 μm polyester insulated platinum wire as conducting electrodes that were dip coated in the PAn ES blend solution and dried in a desiccator.

40|$|Pressure-sensitive {{adhesives}} (PSAs) are adhesives {{that bond}} upon application of light pressure. With applications ranging from everyday home and office supplies to bioelectrodes and spaces shuttle parts, PSAs {{are among the}} fastest growing adhesive markets. Emulsion polymerization is increasingly used {{for the production of}} PSAs due to its higher environmental compliance as well as other advantages (e. g. lower energy consumption, lower capital costs [...] .) compared to other technologies. However, there is a considerable lack of the integration of different areas of knowledge required for the production of PSAs using this technology. Process conditions (e. g. feed composition, temperature, solids content [...] .) are only one area of interest. These conditions will result in inherent polymer properties (e. g. composition, molecular weight distribution, particle size distribution, gel content [...] .), which govern final product properties (e. g. loop tack, peel and shear strength). Better understanding of each area separately (e. g. process parameters, inherent polymer properties, final product properties) and finally, their integration will lead to the improvement of existing and development of new emulsion-based products and processes. In this work, the above-mentioned three areas of PSA production were investigated for <b>butyl</b> acrylate/vinyl <b>acetate</b> emulsion-based polymers. The objectives were to investigate different variables affecting polymerization process, polymer and adhesive properties. The ultimate objective was to develop empirical models that will incorporate these variables to enable better prediction of the PSA properties. The knowledge gained during building of empirical models could later be used for development of mechanistic ones. In this work a screening design was used first to manipulate eight different process variables in order to generate a wide range of inherent polymer properties and final PSA properties. The properties obtained ranged from good, to moderate and to less desirable. However, the major obstacle in this step was the presence of different modes of failure for the same type of adhesive tests.

There is public concern regarding indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in schools, particularly in RCs, but very little data to support or dispel these concerns. Several studies are investigating various aspects of IEQ in California schools. This laboratory-based study focused on evaluating the emissions of toxic and/or odorous volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, from materials used to finish the interiors of new RCs. Furthermore, the study implemented a procedure for VOC source reduction by testing and selecting lower-emitting materials as substitutes for standard materials. In total, 17 standard and alternate floor coverings, wall panels and ceiling panels were quantitatively tested for emissions of VOCs using smallscale environmental chambers. Working with the largest northern California manufacturer of conventional RCs and two school districts, specifications were developed for four new RCs to be produced in early summer 2001. Two of these will be predominantly finished with standard materials. Alternate carpet systems, an alternate wall panel covering and an alternate ceiling panel were selected for the two other RCs {{based on the results}} of the laboratory study and considerations of cost and anticipated performance and maintenance.

A total of 112 components were identified from headspace of intact fruits, including 47 compounds {{reported for the}} first time in pear. The volatile profiles of these pear varieties were characterized by esters, alcohols, hydrocarbons, aldehydes and ketones. Qualitative and quantitative differences of compounds in the profiles are discussed in terms of flavor differences between pear varieties. Analysis of volatiles isolated from eating-ripe pears by direct sniffing GC indicated that a group of nine esters including 2 -methylpropyl-, butyl-, pentyl- and hexyl <b>acetates,</b> <b>butyl</b> butanoate, ethyl hexanoate, methyl trans- 2, cis- 4 -, ethyl trans- 2, cis- 4 - and ethyl cis- 2, cis- 4 - decadienoates from 'Bartlett', 'Cornice' and 'Anjou' pear possessed strong, specific pear-like aroma. A second group of esters was also found to possess very positive aroma and can significantly affect overall sensation by serving as 'contributory to flavor compounds'. A newly developed, solid-phase microextraction technique was used to follow changes of volatile production of 'Bartlett', 'Packham's Triumph' and 'Anjou' pears during ripening. The major esters were found to increase at different rates and times during fruit ripening. Highly significant correlations between specific groups of odor-active compounds and pear flavor intensity during ripening indicated the significant contribution of volatiles to overall pear flavor. The effects of harvest maturity on volatiles differed between fruit varieties. 'Bartlett' harvested at all maturities, upon ripening produced similar amounts of flavor constituents. Higher volatile production was observed in early harvested 'Packham's Triumph'. Delayed harvest significantly reduced volatile production in 'Anjou'. Prolonged storage of fruits resulted in severe reduction of volatile esters in 'Packham's Triumph' and 'Anjou'. Alcohol acyltransferase, the ester synthesizing enzyme was isolated from 'Bartlett', partially purified, and its properties characterized. The enzyme was estimated to have a molecular weight of 40 kD and was most active at pH 7. 5 and 3 O°C.
