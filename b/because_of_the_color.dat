5|$|Originally {{described}} in 1874 {{as a species}} of Boletus, the fungus has also been classified in the genus Leccinum because of the scabers on the stipe, or in Tylopilus <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of the spore print. Molecular genetic analysis revealed that the lilac-brown bolete was separate from both of these genera, and merited placement in a new genus. Sutorius was created to contain this bolete and the closely related Australian species S.australiensis.|$|E
5|$|The bluespotted {{stingray}} {{was discovered}} by Heinrich Kuhl in Java, Indonesia. The population of this species is greatly debatable due to the five different species of rays in Indonesia. Also, {{there are two different}} subgroups: the Java and Bali form. The distinct difference between the two strains is their size, with the Bali being much larger than the Java. On the familial level, the family Dasyatidae is made up of 9 genera and 70 species. The genus of Neotrygon are called maskrays, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> pattern around their eyes.|$|E

Streptococcus pneumoniae {{and a group of}} oral streptococci (Streptococcus viridans or viridans streptococci) display alpha hemolysis. This is sometimes called green hemolysis <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> change in the agar. Other synonymous terms are incomplete hemolysis and partial hemolysis. Alpha hemolysis is caused by hydrogen peroxide produced by the bacterium, oxidizing hemoglobin to green biliverdin.|$|E

Obama expressed [...] "extraordinary appreciation and respect {{for the vast majority of}} police officers" [...] and noted the difficult nature of the job. He stated, [...] "When incidents like this occur, there's a big chunk of our citizenry that feels as if, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of their skin, they are not being treated the same, and that hurts, and that should trouble all of us.
