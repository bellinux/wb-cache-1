5000|$|Sand <b>bed</b> <b>filters</b> work by {{providing}} the particulate solids with many opportunities to be captured {{on the surface of}} a sand grain.

50|$|The {{wastewater}} will {{be disposed}} and {{treated in the}} separation system. While Gray water is locally managed through a sand <b>bed</b> <b>filter</b> planted and then led to a creek in the neighborhood, the black water is processed conventionally using a gravity sewer of the sewage treatment plant of the city Asten. Part of the wastewater will be separated across special toilets and collected in separate sewers. This nutrient-rich fluid is utilized as fertiliser in agriculture. Larger quantities of rain water have special channels or can be fed into the raceway in north of the solarCity.|$|E
50|$|Smaller sand grains {{provide more}} surface area and {{therefore}} a higher decontamination of the inlet water, but it also requires more pumping energy to drive the fluid through the bed. A compromise is that most rapid pressure sand bed filters use grains in the range 0.6 to 1.2 mm although for specialist applications other sizes may be specified. Larger feed particles (>100 micrometres) will tend to block the pores {{of the bed and}} turn it into a surface filter that blinds rapidly. Larger sand grains can be used to overcome this problem, but if significant amounts of large solids are in the feed they need to be removed upstream of the sand <b>bed</b> <b>filter</b> by a process such as settling.|$|E
50|$|Karnataka is {{a pioneer}} in the concept of {{rainwater}} harvesting with The Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology (KSCST) implementing one of the largest rainwater harvesting projects in the world. 23683 schools in rural Karnataka were selected for this project with the main goal of providing drinking water by using the method of rooftop harvesting. In this project, rainwater collected on the rooftop is channeled through a system of PVC pipes and stored in an enclosed surface tank. The pipeline consists of a first-flush filter which flushes out the first rainfall along with other contaminants that may exist on the roof and then subsequent cleaner rainwater is allowed to pass on to the tank. A sand <b>bed</b> <b>filter</b> is used to further eliminate impurities in the water before it gets collected in the tank. Further precautions are taken to prevent dust and insects from entering the tank.|$|E

50|$|Backwashing of {{granular}} media filters involves several steps. First, {{the filter}} is taken off {{line and the}} water is drained to a level that is above {{the surface of the}} <b>filter</b> <b>bed.</b> Next, compressed air is pushed up through the filter material causing the <b>filter</b> <b>bed</b> to expand breaking up the compacted <b>filter</b> <b>bed</b> and forcing the accumulated particles into suspension. After the air scour cycle, clean backwash water is forced upwards through the <b>filter</b> <b>bed</b> continuing the <b>filter</b> <b>bed</b> expansion and carrying the particles in suspension into backwash troughs suspended above the filter surface. In some applications, air and water streams are simultaneously pushed upwards through the granular media followed by a rinse water wash. Backwashing continues for a fixed time, or until the turbidity of the backwash water is below an established value. At the end of the backwash cycle, the upward flow of water is terminated and the <b>filter</b> <b>bed</b> settles by gravity into its initial configuration. Water to be filtered is then applied to the filter surface until the filter clogs and the backwash cycle needs to be repeated.|$|R

50|$|The {{build-up}} of particulate solids causes {{an increase}} in the pressure lost across the bed for a given flow rate. For a gravity fed bed when the pressure available is constant, the flow rate will fall. When the pressure loss or flow is unacceptable and the filter is not working effectively any longer, the bed is backwashed to remove the accumulated particles. For a pressurized rapid sand <b>bed</b> <b>filter</b> this occurs when the pressure drop is around 0.5 bar. The backwash fluid is pumped backwards through the bed until it is fluidized and has expanded by up to about 30% (the sand grains start to mix and as they rub together they drive off the particulate solids). The smaller particulate solids are washed away with the backwash fluid and captured usually in a settling tank. The fluid flow required to fluidize the bed is typically 3 to 10 m3/m2/hr but not run for long (a few minutes). Small amounts of sand can be lost in the backwashing process and the bed may need to be topped up periodically.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} finding {{suitable}} sensor locations for distributed parameter systems (DPS) is tackled as a variable selection problem. Two existing variable selection methods are used: one {{is based on}} principal component analysis (PCA) {{and the other on}} the principal variable (PV) method. A new PCA-based variable selection method, called "orthogonal variables in loading space" (OVL) is introduced. The best sensor location for DPS is dependent on sensor characteristics and also on the time interval of interest. This is illustrated in a case study where the best point in time to replace a packed <b>bed</b> <b>filter</b> is studied. Sensor positions are determined for different time intervals and different types of measurement errors. The resulting sensor positions characterize the overall time behavior of the DPS in the selected time interval. As a test, the specific problem of predicting the exit concentration of the packed <b>bed</b> <b>filter</b> is considered. Lagged PLS models are built and a full search is done to determine the best possible sensor locations.

The purification system was reported to perform well in pollutant removal and the removal efficiencies of SS, TN, NH 4 +-N, NO 3 −-N, NO 2 −-N, and PO 4 3 −-P were all above 50 %, with a hydraulic loading rate of 1.2  m/d. The aquatic plant filter captured approximately 38.0 % of the SS load while the bio-ceramic filter accounted for 50.9 % of COD removal. The gravel <b>bed</b> <b>filter,</b> built for denitrification, eliminated 60.6 % of TN load and 62.0 % of NO 3 − load. The bioceramic filter made no contributions to TN removal, and the effluent TN and NO 3 − increased by 18.4 % and 18.3 %, respectively. Aquatic plant filter was the best at NH 4 +-N removal and removed approximately 41.3 % of the NH 4 +-N load. Additionally, the aquatic plant filter was located in the main pool of phosphorus and removed approximately 58.4 % of TP load and 68.4 % of PO 4 3 −P load.

40|$|For {{coal-fired}} power plants utilizing a gas turbine, the removal of ash particles is necessary to protect the turbine and to meet emission standards. Advantages are also evident for a filter system that can remove other coal-derived contaminants such as alkali, halogens, and ammonia. With most particulates and other contaminants removed, erosion and corrosion of turbine materials, as well as deposition of particles within the turbine, are reduced to acceptable levels. The granular <b>bed</b> <b>filter</b> is suitable for this task in a pressurized gasification or combustion environment. The objective of the base contract was to develop conceptual designs of moving granular <b>bed</b> <b>filter</b> (GBF) and ceramic candle filter technologies for control of particles from integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), pressurized fluidized-bed combustion (PFBC), and direct coal-fueled turbine (DCFT) systems.

40|$|Particulate matter removal at high {{temperatures}} {{has gained a}} great attention {{in the last years}} due to the vast growing of power production plants around the world. A reliable and robust gas cleaning method is inherently necessary to facilitate efficient fuel to energy conversion while protecting all the downstream equipments in a plant. In accordance with the current demand, a detail study has been conducted on panel <b>bed</b> <b>filter</b> which exhibits the suitable characteristic for high temperature applications. The thesis focuses on four main parts related to the  design evaluation, experimental verification and development of new apparatus and method for regeneration  in a panel <b>bed</b> <b>filter.</b> The four main parts are as following; 1. Testing of an advanced new louver design, “ filter tray ” at room and elevated temperature 2. Development of a new apparatus and method  for puff-back cleaning 3. Testing of “filter tray” with the new puff-back apparatus and 4. Industrial scale panel <b>bed</b> <b>filter</b> testing in a commercial combustion plant. A very first laboratory scale panel <b>bed</b> <b>filter</b> with filter tray louvers was built and tested at room temperature. Tests were performed mainly at higher filtration velocities (7 – 31 cm/s) with sintered bauxite spherical particles (mean diameter of 710 m) as filtration medium with standardized test dust (mean diameter of 9 m). The filter demonstrated excellent results at filtration velocity of 30 cm/s however unstable residual pressure drop profile and high dust penetration were recorded, suggesting the depth of the granular beds are too shallow. A second laboratory scale panel-bed filter with filter tray louvers with deeper granular beds, i. e. 40 mm was built. The gas-entry surfaces are much larger than the first test rig. Tests were performed from low to high filtration velocities with sintered bauxite spherical particles (mean diameter of 470 & 710 m) and olivine sand particles (mean diameter of 545 m) as filtration medium and standardized test dust (mean diameter of 4 & 9 m) as test dust at room temperature and at 120 °C. The filter illustrated excellent results however failure in the conventional puff-back method to supply sufficient sharp pressure pulse led to improper removal of filter cake. Accordingly, {{there is a need for}} an improved means of supplying puff-back gas to the tall wide panel beds. A novel high speed valve, a new method and apparatus for creating a longitudinally disposed sharp puff of gas for renewal of gas-entry surfaces was built and tested independently. The quick opening valve consists of a standard cylinder with air outlet holes, a rod with nylon plugs and an actuator. The valve was built in the laboratory; several adjustments were made along the test until the time for emptying of the pressure in the tank was less than 50 ms. It was then integrated with the second test rig, referred to as third  test rig. Tests were performed at room temperature with the aid of high-speed camera to obtain visualization of the movement of the granular beds during puff-back with and without the presence of filter cake. Filtration test were performed at elevated temperature of 120 °C. Tests were performed from low to high filtration velocities with sintered bauxite spherical particles (mean diameter of 470 µm) and olivine sand particles (mean diameter of 545 m) as filtration medium and standardized test dust (mean diameter of 4 m). The results and video file analysis revealed that the new puff-back method is capable of removing the entire filter cake, resulting in stable residual pressure profile and very low dust penetration compared to the conventional puff-back. An industrial scale panel <b>bed</b> <b>filter</b> testing is the fourth test rig. The field test was performed with a single filter module of louver design L 10 - 56 at a 450 -kW biomass combustion plant at Bjertnæs Sag AS in Jevnaker in Norway. The test was performed with a slip stream from the main stream of exhaust gas before emitting to the chimney. The test was performed at superficial velocity between 5. 4 - 6. 9 cm/s with total flow rate of 290 - 370 m 3 /h at 120 °C with inlet dust concentration between 1. 4 to 1. 8 g/m 3. Olivine sand particles with mean diameter of 545 m were used as filtration medium. The results showed filter cakes are being formed on the gas-entry surfaces and the penetration was lower than the allowed limit during the beginning of the test. Nonetheless, due to some instability caused probably by some slight variation in the louver geometry led to higher emission towards the end of the test and hence further testing was interrupted.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest {{in the development of}} in situ methods of contaminated soil and groundwater treatment, such as soil stabilization, permeable reactive barriers and soil <b>bed</b> <b>filters.</b> Because these techniques are passive, their operation and maintenance costs are low. In this study, peat moss has been investigated as a low-cost alternative sorption material for permeable reactive barriers and soil <b>bed</b> <b>filters.</b> Peat moss showed the highest sorption capacity for metals among the alternative products studied in a comparative batch test with bark, sawdust, fiber ashes, shrimp shell and seaweed. Batch tests and column experiments were carried out with both artificial solutions and highly contaminated landfill leachate. All the metals studied (Cd, Pb, Ni, Cu, Zn and Cr) were removed by peat by more then 70 % from single metal artificial solutions in a concentration range of 0, 1 - 10 mgl- 1. The lower performance (33 - 40 % for Zn and Cd) of the sorbent for complex solutions, i. e. real leachates, suggests competitive sorption. Freundlich adsorption isotherms were plotted and adsorption evaluated from the Freundlich constants Kf and n. The influence of different factors on sorption onto peat i. e. variation in metal concentrations, pH and competition between metals were investigated. The material used was characterized by measuring dry weight, lost of ignition, grain size distribution, metal and organic content, pH, buffer capacity, conductivity, redox potential, ion exchange capacity, pore size volume, density, hydraulic conductivity among other parameters. The results obtained provide important information on peat moss adsorption capacity under different environmental conditions, which can be used in the design and construction of permeable reactive barriers or soil <b>bed</b> <b>filters...</b>|$|R
