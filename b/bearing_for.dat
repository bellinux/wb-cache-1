25|$|A pilot cutter {{cruising}} in {{the vicinity}} of Lundy Island had encountered Montagu a short time earlier. The battleship had stopped engines, come abreast, and hailed from the bridge requesting a distance and <b>bearing</b> <b>for</b> Hartland Point on the mainland of England. Though the cutter supplied these accurately, the voice from the battleships bridge replied that they must be wrong and that the pilot cutter must have lost her bearings. As Montagu restarted her engines and began to move ahead, the cutter shouted back that on her present course Montagu would be on Shutter Rock within ten minutes, and a short time later the sound of the battleship running aground carried through the fog.|$|E

The SKF trademark as it looks today was used instead for all the SKF-products. Some pre-series of Volvo-bearings stamped with the brand name 'Volvo' were manufactured but never released to the market, and it was not until 1927 that the trademark was used again, now as a trademark and company name for an automobile.|$|E

2500|$|Justice O'Connor {{began with}} the {{argument}} that rather than allowing the Constitution to dictate what elements of crimes are, the Court usually deferred to the legislature's definition of the elements that constitute a crime.

2500|$|This is {{what the}} third column of the toleta is for. [...] The return angles are {{expressed}} as quarters from the intended course bearing (not the current course bearing). [...] In our example, the mariner intended to go east, but has been sailing southeast-by-east for 100 miles. [...] Given the winds, he decides {{it is best to}} return to the original course by re-orienting the ship east-northeast (ENE, [...] "Greco-Levante"). [...] ENE is two quarter-winds above the intended bearing, East, so now he looks at second row ("quarters = 2") on the table. [...] In the third column, the ritorno, shows the number 26. [...] This represents the required number of miles he must travel on ENE <b>bearing</b> <b>for</b> every 10 miles of alargar. [...] Remember, his alargar (distance from intended course) was 55 miles. [...] So in order to return to his intended course he must travel 5.5 [...] 26 = 143 miles on ENE. [...] In other words, he needs to hold his ENE <b>bearing</b> <b>for</b> 143 miles; once that distance is travelled, he should straighten his ship East, and he will be exactly on the intended course.|$|E
2500|$|The final column (avanzo di ritorno) {{gives the}} length on the {{intended}} course {{he has made}} good by his return travel. [...] This is also expressed in terms per 10 miles alargar. His alargar was 55, and his angle of return was ENE (thus q = 2), that means his avanzo di ritorno is 5.5 [...] 24 = 132. [...] In other words, if everything goes right, and our mariner holds his ENE <b>bearing</b> <b>for</b> 143 miles (ritorno), then during that return, he will have covered an additional 132 miles on his intended eastward course (avanzo di ritorno).|$|E

The (Edwardian period) Ivatt Atlantic that replaced Mallard at Peterborough was only just in sight when the head of publicity started handing out the pictures.|$|E
2500|$|For navigators {{near the}} equator {{celestial}} navigation is simplified since the whole celestial sphere is exposed. Any star that passes the zenith (overhead) {{is on the}} celestial equator, {{the basis of the}} equatorial coordinate system. Each star has a specific declination, and when they rise or set, they give a <b>bearing</b> <b>for</b> navigation. Stars are learned by compass point, making a star compass (star compasses list ~150 stars, in some systems). A simplified compass might list only a couple of dozen stars. For example, in the Caroline Islands Mau Piailug taught natural navigation using a star compass diagrammed here. The development of [...] "sidereal compasses" [...] has been studied and theorized to have developed from an ancient pelorus.|$|E

Entering the East China Sea and <b>bearing</b> <b>for</b> the Korea Strait, Cutter sank two more ships, then returned to Pearl Harbor on 12 December.

2500|$|By a {{handbook}} or a portolan chart, a navigator {{could see}} immediately that, for example, Pisa lay 85 miles southeast ("Scirocco" [...] {{in the traditional}} compass rose nomenclature) of Genoa, and so a ship that set out from Genoa to Pisa would simply maintain that <b>bearing</b> <b>for</b> that distance. However, most sailing courses were not nearly that neat. [...] A mariner wishing to sail from Majorca to Naples could tell the latter was due east ("Levante") by some 600 miles – but the island of Sardinia lies in the way, therefore the ship's bearing must be changed along the route. [...] This is easier said than done, as geographical coordinates did not exist during this era. [...] The only way to determine the exact position of the ship at sea would be to calculate via past bearing and distance travelled.|$|E
