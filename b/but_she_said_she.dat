25|$|Wenceslao Retana, a {{political}} commentator in Spain, had slighted Rizal by writing an insulting article in La Epoca, {{a newspaper in}} Madrid. He implied that the family and friends of Rizal were evicted from their lands in Calamba for not having paid their due rents. The incident (when Rizal was ten) stemmed from an accusation that Rizal's mother, Teodora, tried to poison {{the wife of a}} cousin, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> was trying to help. With the approval of the Church prelates, and without a hearing, she was ordered to prison in Santa Cruz in 1871. She was made to walk the ten miles (16km) from Calamba. She was released after two-and-a-half years of appeals to the highest court. In 1887, Rizal wrote a petition on behalf of the tenants of Calamba, and later that year led them to speak out against the friars' attempts to raise rent. They initiated a litigation which resulted in the Dominicans' evicting them from their homes, including the Rizal family. General Valeriano Weyler had the buildings on the farm torn down.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Hewson {{participated in}} Greenpeace {{protests against the}} Sellafield plant for nuclear reprocessing, located across the Irish Sea in Cumbria, England. She was {{especially}} set against the under-construction Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant component being opened. She was aboard Greenpeace's MV Solo when it staged a publicity-oriented [...] "raid" [...] wherein the band members landed {{on the beach at}} the plant in rubber dinghies, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> had not been responsible for that particular protest.|$|E

500|$|Gaga first {{performed}} an acoustic-jazz {{version of the}} song at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, Cumbria in May 15, 2011. During the song, she revealed that her record company had told her to keep new material to a minimum, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> wanted to air the track in full. Another piano version of the song was performed on May 21, 2011, on the season finale of Saturday Night Live, where Gaga wore a metallic black dress, knee-high boots and a semi-circular metallic headdress. The full version was first performed at the final show of American Idol season 10 on May 25, 2011, where she was joined by Clemons in person. Gaga appeared perched atop a mountain top on the [...] "Idol" [...] stage, dressed in a long cape and a bedazzled headpiece. A trio of dancers were {{at the base of}} the set performing choreographed dance steps while Gaga sang from the top. At the end of the performance, Gaga and a dancer embraced each other, took a breath and then jumped off the edge of the stage, landing out of sight on a bed of fake rocks, as steam shot up high in the air. Len Melisurgo from The Star-Ledger felt that the performance was too [...] "sexually suggestive" [...] for the audience of American Idol and wondered whether Gaga [...] "went just a little too far for a family-oriented show that's geared toward a younger audience?" [...] Conversely, Adam Graham from MTV News listed it as one of Gaga's most memorable television performances. Monica Herrera from Billboard listed it as the fourth best performance of the night, and felt that Gaga [...] "channeled Bruce Springsteen" [...] in her personality.|$|E
2500|$|Lucretia Brown was a 50-year-old {{spinster}} {{who lived}} in Ipswich, Massachusetts, a town about [...] northeast of Salem, Massachusetts. An injury to her spine in childhood left her an invalid, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> had been healed through Christian Science. She suffered a relapse in 1877 and again in 1878, and accused Spofford of having interfered with her health through [...] "mesmermism". [...] Her lawsuit stated: ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 12, 1957, Hughes married actress Jean Peters. The couple {{met in the}} 1940s, before Peters {{became a}} film actress. They had a highly publicized romance in 1947 and {{there was talk of}} marriage, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> could not combine it with her career. Some later claimed that Peters was [...] "the only woman [...] ever loved," [...] and he {{reportedly}} had his security officers follow her everywhere even when they were not in a relationship. Such reports were confirmed by actor Max Showalter, who became a close friend of Peters while shooting Niagara (1953). Showalter told in an interview that because he frequently met with Peters, Hughes' men threatened to ruin his career if he did not leave her alone.|$|E

2500|$|Nasya Nenova {{attempted}} suicide. She {{testified that}} she confessed and attempted suicide {{because she was}} afraid she would be tortured again. She was interrogated alongside Ashraf and told the court they were beaten {{and that there was}} no interpreter. She did not confess to having illegal sexual relations with him. She, along with Vulcheva, are the only nurses who admitted knowing Ashraf by sight beforehand, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> had never spoken with him. She denied having attempted suicide out of guilt for what she had done. In court she stated that [...] "I am not guilty on any of the counts. My conscience is clear." [...] and [...] "We had protection from no-one, we had no doctor. We were alone there with those men who did everything they wanted to do". She said she attempted to retract her confession on 17 July 1999, but that a Colonel Juma came and threatened to renew the torture if she persisted.|$|E
2500|$|Four years {{following}} Frederick's death, a verdict in favor for Saide E. Pritchard (of Denver, Colorado) against King's wife, Hazel, and the King estate, for $20,458 ($219,000 in 2016), was vacated by Judge F. H. Rudkin in 1924. [...] The original award of $20,458 {{in favor of}} Pritchard returned by a jury in the United States district court against King's estate was set aside because, in Judge Rudkin's opinion, said [...] "the verdict was {{not supported by the}} evidence." [...] Sadie Pritchard based her suit on $35,000 ($500,000 in 2016) she invested with King, intended for various mining ventures, while living in Denver, Colorado in 1892, and the evidence showed to be the nucleus of a $300,000 fortune ($4 million in 2016) King accumulated before his death. [...] Pritchard sued on the ground that King never made a settlement with her, although evidence showed he intended to. [...] She alleged that she was entitled to receive half of all profits which accrued; and profits from the ventures reached the total of about $750,000 ($10 million in 2016), <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> only received $14,000 ($200,000 in 2016) before Frederick's death in 1920.|$|E

60|$|She {{begged her}} pardon afterwards, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> {{had to do}} it, and she took what comfort she could in {{slamming}} everything round, as she called it, in her studio, when she went with Cornelia to have her coffee there. The maid restored it to its conscious picturesqueness the next day.|$|E

60|$|Probably Mrs. Bolton {{believed}} {{too that}} a man's mind was agile enough for these conjectures; <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> did not suppose {{he would take}} it in that way; she added that he stayed longer than she expected, because the little girl seemed to like it so much; she always cried {{when she had to}} go away.|$|E

60|$|He first {{proposed}} {{to her to}} go and live in Dublin, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> preferred Dunmore. He then talked of selling the house, and to this she agreed.
