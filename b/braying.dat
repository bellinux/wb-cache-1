5|$|Equines {{produce a}} number of vocalizations and noises. Loud {{snorting}} is associated with alarm. Squealing is usually made when in pain, but bachelors will also squeal while play fighting. The contact calls of equines vary from the whinnying and nickering of the horse, the barking of plains zebras, and the <b>braying</b> of asses and Grévy's zebras. Equines also communicate with visual displays and the flexibility of their lips allows them to make complex facial expressions. Visual displays also incorporate {{the positions of the}} head, ears and tail. An equine may signal an intention to kick by laying back its ears and sometimes lashing the tail. Flattened ears, bared teeth and abrupt movement of the heads may be used as threatening gestures, particularly among stallions.|$|E
5|$|Female {{macaroni}} penguins {{can begin}} breeding at around {{five years of}} age, while the males do not normally breed until at least six years old. Females breed {{at a younger age}} because the male population is larger. The surplus of male penguins allows the female penguins to select more experienced male partners as soon as the females are physically able to breed. Commencing a few days after females arrive at the colony, sexual displays are used by males to attract partners and advertise their territory, and by pairs once together at the nest site and at changeover of incubation shifts. In the 'ecstatic display', a penguin bows forward, making loud throbbing sounds, and then extends its head and neck up until its neck and beak are vertical. The bird then waves its head from side to side, <b>braying</b> loudly. Birds also engage in mutual bowing, trumpeting, and preening. Monitoring of pair fidelity at South Georgia has shown around three-quarters of pairs will breed together again the following year.|$|E

To fit his new persona, Kirby created the clownish Oswald character, wearing a floppy, wide-brimmed hat, tattered bib overalls, oversized work shoes and adopting a <b>braying</b> laugh.|$|E

25|$|Priapus joined Pan and the satyrs as {{a spirit}} of {{fertility}} and growth, though he was perennially frustrated by his impotence. In a ribald anecdote told by Ovid, he attempted to rape the goddess Hestia but was thwarted by an ass, whose <b>braying</b> caused him to lose his erection at the critical moment and woke Hestia. The episode gave him a lasting hatred of asses {{and a willingness to}} see them destroyed in his honour. The emblem of his lustful nature was his permanent erection and his large penis. Another myth states that he pursued the nymph Lotis until the gods took pity on her and turned her into a lotus plant.|$|E
25|$|England were {{dismissed}} just before tea, so the interval was taken early and Ian Redpath and Ian Chappell {{came out to}} open as Rick McCoster was still dazed from his injury, having fielded {{for only a few}} overs in the morning before he had to retire again. Chappell was caught by David Lloyd close to the ground off Willis, but there no immediate appeal as Lloyd had hurt his bruised fingers and left to have then tended when the Australian captain was given out. This brought in his brother Greg Chappell at 15/1 and he added 108 runs with Redpath {{by the end of the}} day, with 100 runs coming in 110 minutes. Resuming on 123/1 Redpath and Chappell took their partnership to 220 runs, a record for Australia against England in Australia, beating the 216 made by Bill Woodfull and Hunter Hendry back in 1928–29. These came slowly at first as Edrich set defensive filed and Arnold and Willis bowled accurately for the first 90 minutes. However, when they were replaced by Underwood, Titmus and Greig, Chappell increased the run-rate and when Willis returned the Queensland captain took 13 runs off one over. He made his first century of the series, 1,000 run of the season and was dropped on 136 by Underwood at deep fine-leg with The Hill <b>braying</b> behind him. He was out for 144 trying to hit Arnold for six and skying the ball to Lloyd at mid-wicket. Chappell had now made 122, 51, 58, 71, 62, 2, 61, 44, 84 and 144 against the tourists in the season, including the Queensland vs MCC match and the One Day International. Walters came in and tried to impress his fans with another Perth-like run feast, but tried to hit Underwood across the line and was bowled for 5. With the sluggish Redpath now setting the pace and England trying to delay the declaration the game drifted, but the opener was out for 105 in 344 minutes when he uncharacteristically hit out at Underwood (2/65) and was caught by the substitute Chris Old. A few runs late Marsh was nearly run out and hurried off to the pavilion as Australia declared at 289/4, leaving England 400 runs to win in 500 minutes.|$|E

500|$|Lynott, Thin Lizzy's {{de facto}} leader, was {{composer}} or co-composer {{of almost all}} of the band's songs, and the first black Irishman to achieve commercial success in the field of rock music. Thin Lizzy featured several critically acclaimed guitarists throughout their history, with Downey and Lynott as the rhythm section, on the drums and bass guitar. As well as being multiracial, the band drew their members not only {{from both sides of the}} Irish border but also from both the Catholic and Protestant communities during The Troubles. Their music reflects a wide range of influences, including blues, soul music, psychedelic rock, and traditional Irish folk music, but is generally classified as hard rock or sometimes heavy metal.

500|$|The Southern Boobook is a mainly nocturnal species, though may {{be active}} {{at dawn and}} dusk. It is heard much more {{commonly}} than seen, being particularly vocal in breeding season. The characteristic two-note boo-book call or hoot can be heard up to [...] away, the second note generally lower than the first. Calling takes place from sunset through till dawn, generally with a peak in the two hours after dusk and just before dawn. It can continue for several hours. The male's hooting is higher pitched and of shorter duration—and is heard much more commonly—than that of the female. He uses it as a contact call and to advertise his territory to females, as well as when bringing food to his mate or even before mating. Birds give a harsher version of the call when mobbing intruders. Both sexes—though mainly the female—give a single monosyllabic hoot as an alarm call or warning. Southern boobooks also make a repetitive croaking or grunting call while courting, mating or greeting, or {{as a response to}} other boobooks hooting. Birds may switch from croaks to hoots seamlessly. Males generally croak {{at the beginning of the}} evening, and when arriving at the nest with food. A purring or <b>braying</b> call is used by both sexes as a contact call around the nest and (more quietly) when bringing food to nestlings, or by the female to beg for food from the male. The female makes a low trill during courtship and nesting. Growls, high-pitched yelps and screeches can be made when attacking intruders.|$|E
2500|$|Donkeys {{are also}} {{referred}} to repeatedly in the writings and imagery of the Hindu and Islamic religions.

[...] In Hinduism, the goddess Kalaratri's vahana (vehicle) is a donkey. Donkeys also appear multiple times in Indian folklore as the subject of stories in both the Hitopadesha and the Panchatantra.|$|E

[...] Despite this, she rarely participates directly in the running of the hotel.

2500|$|It {{was in its}} use of {{pre-recorded}} {{and live}} sound effects that The Goon Show broke the most new ground. [...] Part {{of the problem was}} that [...] "not even Milligan knew how to capture electronically the peculiar sounds that came alive in his head– he just knew when it had not yet happened". An example of this comes from an often cited story of Milligan filling his two socks with custard in the Camden Theatre canteen, in an attempt to achieve a squelching effect. Milligan asked the BBC canteen ladies to make some custard; they thought he must have some stomach trouble so lovingly made him a fresh custard– which he accepted with thanks and immediately poured into his sock, much to their horror. Secombe recalled [...] "Back in the studio, Spike had already placed a sheet of three-ply near a microphone." [...] One after the other, he swung them around his head against the wood, but failed to produce the sound effect he was seeking ("So, a sock full of custard and no sound effect!"). Secombe noted that [...] "Spike used to drive the studio managers mad with his insistence on getting the sound effects he wanted. In the beginning, when the programme was recorded on disc, it was extremely difficult to achieve the right sound effect. There were, I think, four turntables on the go simultaneously, with different sounds being played on each– chickens clucking, Big Ben striking, donkeys <b>braying,</b> massive explosions, ships' sirens– all happening at once. It was only when tape came into use that Spike felt really happy with the effects." [...] An FX instruction in one script read [...] "Sound effect of two lions walking away, bumping against each other. If you can't get two lions, two hippos will do". [...] Over time, the sound engineers became increasingly adept at translating the script into desired sounds, assisted [...] from the late 1950s onwards by specialists in the BBC's newly formed Radiophonic Workshop.|$|E
