40|$|A 58 -year-old {{woman was}} {{involved}} in a motor vehicle accident. She sustained diffuse swelling over the dorsum of her dominant hand along with a hematoma extending from the level of the metacarpophalangeal joint to the wrist. There was also extensive bruising over the palmer aspect. There was no obvious neurovascular compromise. QUESTIONS 1. What is the diagnosis? 2. Is there any eponym for the intra-articular fractures of the base of the fifth metacarpal. 3. Describe briefly the mechanism causing such fracture. 4. What are the treatment options? DISCUSSION This is an intra-articular fracture of the fifth metacarpal. Intra-articular fractures of the fifth metacarpal resemble <b>Bennett’s</b> <b>and</b> Rolando’s frac-tures in their pattern 1, 2 and their tendency to be unstable. 1, 3 Hence they are sometimes referred to as “Mirrored ” <b>Bennett’s</b> <b>and</b> Rolando’s Fractures...|$|R
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, an {{energetic}} movement arose, centered in Greenwich Village, that sought to overturn bans on free speech.Kersch, Kenneth Ira, Freedom of Speech: Rights and Liberties under the Law, ABC-CLIO, 2003, pp. 109–110. Supported by radicals, feminists, anarchists, and atheists such as Ezra Heywood, Moses Harman, D. M. <b>Bennett,</b> <b>and</b> Emma Goldman, these activists regularly battled anti-obscenity laws and, later, the government's effort to suppress speech critical of involvement in World War I. Prior to 1914, the free speech movement focused on politics, and rarely addressed contraception.|$|E

5|$|It seems {{curious that}} a text so {{obviously}} written {{with the expectation}} that it would be widely copied should exist in only one manuscript and that, apparently, a draft.

Orm, however, says in the preface that he wishes Walter to remove any wording that he finds clumsy or incorrect (quoted in <b>Bennett</b> <b>and</b> Smithers 1982, pp.175–76).|$|E

5|$|Jerry Goldsmith had {{composed}} {{the music for}} The Motion Picture, but {{was not an option}} for The Wrath of Khan given the reduced budget; Meyer's composer for Time After Time, Miklós Rózsa, was likewise prohibitively expensive. <b>Bennett</b> <b>and</b> Meyer wanted the music for the film to go in a different direction, but had not decided on a composer by the time filming began.
