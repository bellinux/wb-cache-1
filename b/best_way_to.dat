Following the film's success, Fox Searchlight Pictures wanted a sequel, but the Hesses delayed due to commitments to other projects and fear that audiences would tire of the Napoleon Dynamite characters.|$|E
5|$|The {{second line}} of {{development}} {{pursued by the}} Manhattan Project used the fissile element plutonium. Although small amounts of plutonium exist in nature, the <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> obtain large quantities of the element is in a nuclear reactor, in which natural uranium is bombarded by neutrons. The uranium-238 is transmuted into uranium-239, which rapidly decays, first into neptunium-239 and then into plutonium-239. Only {{a small amount of}} the uranium-238 will be transformed, so the plutonium must be chemically separated from the remaining uranium, from any initial impurities, and from fission products.|$|E

5|$|A general {{application}} of matrices in physics {{is to the}} description of linearly coupled harmonic systems. The equations of motion of such systems {{can be described in}} matrix form, with a mass matrix multiplying a generalized velocity to give the kinetic term, and a force matrix multiplying a displacement vector to characterize the interactions. The <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> obtain solutions is to determine the system's eigenvectors, its normal modes, by diagonalizing the matrix equation. Techniques like this are crucial {{when it comes to the}} internal dynamics of molecules: the internal vibrations of systems consisting of mutually bound component atoms. They are also needed for describing mechanical vibrations, and oscillations in electrical circuits.|$|E
5|$|According to Louis Philippe, the game's audio director, {{the team}} {{originally}} used intense music and sounds to create tension. However, the team decided to scrap this idea, {{realizing that the}} <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> create a tense atmosphere is to create the sounds of other players, which are often unexpected. The team created Navigation Sounds, in which the sound a player made is determined by their operators' weight, armor, and speed. Gadget deployment such as fortifying and breach-charging create louder sounds that may reveal the player's presence. The team thought {{that this would be}} enjoyable for players and influence their gameplay experience. The game's music was composed by Paul Haslinger, who had worked on the score of the previous Rainbow Six games and the Far Cry series. His co-composer was Ben Frost, who debuted his first video game soundtrack with Siege. Leon Purviance assisted Frost and Haslinger in composing the music.|$|E

5|$|After {{joining the}} Jesuits Soegija spent another year in Mariëndaal in juniorate. Beginning in 1923 he studied {{philosophy}} at Berchmann College in Oudenbosch; {{during this time}} he examined the teachings of Thomas Aquinas and began writing on Christianity. In a letter dated 11August 1923, he wrote that the Javanese were so far unable to discern between Catholics and Protestants, and that the <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> convert the Javanese was by deeds, not words. He also translated some {{of the results of}} the 27th International Eucharistic Congress, held in Amsterdam in 1924, for the Javanese-language magazine Swaratama, which circulated mainly among Xaverius alumni. Several of Soegija's other writings were published in St. Claverbond, Berichten uit Java. He graduated from Berchmann in 1926, then began preparations to return to the Indies.|$|E
5|$|Amanda Ripley's {{introduction}} in Aliens was {{not included}} in the theatrical version of the film, since 20th Century Fox was concerned about the film's running time. Sigourney Weaver criticized the cut, seeing Amanda as crucial to Ellen Ripley's character development and her bond with the orphaned Newt. While developing Alien: Isolation, Creative Assembly originally desired a female protagonist and decided to use Amanda as the <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> focus on her mother, Ellen's, traits. The picture model for Ripley in Aliens is Elizabeth Inglis, Sigourney Weaver's mother, and in Alien: Isolation she is voiced by Andrea Deck with motion capture by Kezia Burrows. Amanda's design in Alien: Isolation was based on pictures from Elizabeth Inglis' youth.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} mandate {{coupled with}} subsidies for private insurance {{as a means}} for universal healthcare was considered the <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> win the support of the Senate because it had been included in prior bipartisan reform proposals. The concept goes back to at least 1989, when the conservative The Heritage Foundation proposed an individual mandate as an alternative to single-payer health care. It was championed for a time by conservative economists and Republican senators as a market-based approach to healthcare reform on the basis of individual responsibility and avoidance of free rider problems. Specifically, because the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires any hospital participating in Medicare (nearly all do) to provide emergency care to anyone who needs it, the government often indirectly bore the cost of those without the ability to pay.|$|E
