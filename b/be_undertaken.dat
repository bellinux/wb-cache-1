5|$|At {{the same}} time, {{there would be}} a {{continuing}} need for fast freight locomotives, capable of operating on both electrified and non-electrified routes, without impeding the intensive use of the system by passenger trains. Suburban electrification used electric multiple units, which had no equivalent freight design. Although Bulleid built two prototype electric locomotives in 1941, these were, as yet, unproven, and freight haulage would <b>be</b> <b>undertaken</b> by steam traction for the foreseeable future.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Wurster's and Ganzert's visit to the site, the entire bridge was buried by river sediments up to the {{springing}} line of the vaults. No efforts to dig them up were undertaken by Wurster and Ganzert. Only two of the 28 arches were exposed enough so that direct measurements of the clear span and the pier width could <b>be</b> <b>undertaken.</b> It was, however, possible to calculate {{the dimensions of the}} remaining bays from their exposed sections.|$|E
5|$|In April 2012, state {{officials}} {{released a report}} detailing possible sites for an infill station in East Lyme. Four sites were analyzed – two near downtown Niantic and two at Rocky Neck State Park. Niantic had previously been {{a stop on the}} Clamdigger. As part of a bonding proposal made by Governor Malloy, $750,000 would be allocated for a new station at Niantic. A study will <b>be</b> <b>undertaken</b> to analyze the corridor capacity impacts that the station would bring.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{strengthen}} relationships within clans and communities, {{and to promote}} moderation and equitable distribution of resources, Andrianampoinimerina decreed that families should build larger, monolithic stone tombs to hold the remains of all family members, and that the construction of these tombs was to <b>be</b> <b>undertaken</b> as a shared responsibility {{among members of the}} family to be entombed there.|$|E

5|$|The {{level of}} greening—strategic, quasi-strategic, or tactical—dictates what {{activities}} should <b>be</b> <b>undertaken</b> by a company. Strategic greening {{in one area}} {{may or may not}} be leveraged effectively in others. A firm could make substantial changes in production processes but opt not to leverage them by positioning itself as an environmental leader. So although strategic greening is not necessarily strategically integrated into all marketing activities, it is nevertheless strategic in the product area.|$|E
5|$|The total {{estimated}} completion {{cost for}} construction of Varanasi Metro {{is estimated to be}} Rs. 17,227 Crores, including taxes and duties. The project is envisaged to <b>be</b> <b>undertaken</b> as a Joint Venture (JV) project between the Government of India (GoI) and the Government of Uttar Pradesh (GoUP) with 50:50 equity partnerships. To maintain the financial viability of the project, additional grants have been proposed from the two governments in addition to their equity contribution.|$|E
5|$|The urban {{regeneration}} company Clydebank Re-Built started a £3.75m restoration project in 2005, and the crane {{opened to the}} public in August 2007. The structure was shot-blasted to remove old paint and rust, allowing repairs to <b>be</b> <b>undertaken</b> before repainting. A lift for visitors to ascend to the jib and an emergency evacuation stair were installed, along with a wire mesh around the viewing area and floodlights to illuminate the crane at night.|$|E

5|$|After a {{hard but}} {{inconclusive}} fight during which Admiral Brézé was killed, the French fleet withdrew to Toulon leaving {{the sea to}} the Spanish, who decided not to pursue them to relieve Orbetello. The land forces disembarked by Count of Linhares a few days later, however, failed to dislodge the French lines, and the siege could <b>be</b> <b>undertaken</b> until 24 July, when another Spanish army led by the Marquis of Torrecuso and the Duke of Arcos, which {{had come from the}} Kingdom of Naples across the Papal States, defeated the besieging French troops, forcing them to retreat with heavy losses.|$|E
5|$|Before any troop {{transportation}} could <b>be</b> <b>undertaken,</b> all of {{the ships}} had to be hastily refitted. Of the fourteen ships, four, including El Occidente, were designated to carry animals and cargo; the other ten were designated to carry human passengers. The four ships designated to carry animals had to have ramps and stalls built. All the ships had to have gun platforms installed, before each ship docked at the Brooklyn Navy Yard to have the guns themselves installed. All the ships were manned by merchant officers and crews but carried two U.S. Navy officers, Navy gun crews, quartermasters, signalmen, and wireless operators. The senior Navy officer on board would take control if a ship came under attack.|$|E
5|$|Chartjackers {{documented}} {{the lives of}} Day, Haggart, Hill and McDonnell as they attempted to write, record and release a charity single through crowdsourcing. The series was shown in real time, {{with each of the}} first ten episodes detailing the events of the previous seven days. On 5 September 2009, one week before the programme's first episode aired, the group announced on the YouTube channel ChartJackersProject their intention to release a number one single within their ten-week time frame. A different task would <b>be</b> <b>undertaken</b> each week, so that, {{by the end of the}} project, the song would be completed.|$|E

Therapeutic polypectomy <b>was</b> <b>undertaken</b> in 21 % of examinations. Its value in acute colonic disease is discussed, and the importance of training colonoscopists for the future is emphasized...|$|R
5|$|Crete {{had been}} the target of Muslim attacks since the first wave of the Muslim conquests in the mid-7th century. It had {{suffered}} a first raid in 654 and again in 674/675, and parts of the island were temporarily occupied during the reign of the Umayyad Caliph al-Walid I (r. 705–715). Nevertheless, the island was never conquered and despite occasional raids in the 8th century it remained securely in Byzantine hands; Crete was too far from the Arab naval bases in the Levant for an effective expedition against it to <b>be</b> <b>undertaken.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of direct incentives, many firms applied {{to move to the}} Manor Royal estate: it was {{considered}} such an attractive place to relocate to that the Development Corporation was able to choose between applicants to achieve the ideal mix of firms, and little advertising or promotion had to <b>be</b> <b>undertaken.</b> One year after Manor Royal was opened, eighteen firms were trading there, including four with more than 100 employees and one with more than 1,000. By 1964, businesses which had moved to the town since 1950 employed 16,000 people; the master plan had anticipated between 8,000 and 8,500. In 1978 there were 105 such firms, employing nearly 20,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Digestive tract telangiectasias may be {{identified}} on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach and {{first part of}} the small intestine). This procedure will typically only <b>be</b> <b>undertaken</b> if there is anemia that is more marked than expected by the severity of nosebleeds, or if there is evidence of severe bleeding (vomiting blood, black stools). If the number of lesions seen on endoscopy is unexpectedly low, the remainder of the small intestine may be examined with capsule endoscopy, in which the patient swallows a capsule-shaped device containing a miniature camera which transmits images of the digestive tract to a portable digital recorder.|$|E
