25|$|The hull {{measurements}} of Furst Menschikoff differed considerably {{from those of}} the contemporary sailing ships; the ratio between the length and width was normally about three and half, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> about six. The long hull was a modern feature and made to fit the requirements of an engine propelled ship. Most likely Kjeldman had received the drawings from some foreign ship designer. The hull was made from pine and constructed by using carvel method.|$|E
25|$|From December 1970 through January 1971, the Raiders {{underwent}} retraining courses. After {{a few minor}} actions, in April 1971, 24 Raiders disguised in NVA garb {{provided with}} three 81mm mortars, were inserted north of Mu Gia to attack a NVA rest area. The Raiders' landing zone had been used previously by the MR 4 Raiders, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> occupied by North Vietnamese troops. The incoming Raiders were caught under fire {{as soon as they}} touched down and their CIA adviser lost all radio contact with them. Five weeks later, the first {{of a small group of}} only five survivors made it back to friendly territory.|$|E
25|$|While {{he was in}} {{hospital}} recovering from malaria, Moses received a personal letter from the Prime Minister of Australia, John Curtin. His Australian Labor Party had always been treated roughly by the newspapers, particularly the Murdoch press, and when {{it had come to}} power in 1941, it had instructed the ABC to ignore its agreements with the news agencies, and to gather its own news. Curtin feared that unless Moses was at the helm, the ABC would revert to sourcing all its news from the agencies. Moreover, Curtin wanted the ABC to develop a sense of national identity, and to provide the workers and service personnel with more entertainment. This last task inevitably set Moses up for a clash with Cleary, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the general manager who held the cards, and Cleary resigned on 30 March 1945.|$|E

500|$|Resupply {{proved to}} be a {{difficult}} task. The battalion had cleared the supply route two days previously in its attack to the G Company position <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> closed again. The battalion commander requested air supply and the next morning, September 5, eight transport planes accomplished the resupply and the 2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry, was ready to resume its attack to the rear. By evening it had cleared the supply road and adjacent terrain of North Korean penetration for a distance of [...] to the rear of G Company's front-line positions. There the 2-27th Infantry received orders to halt and prepare to attack northeast to link up with the 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry.|$|E
500|$|The {{next meeting}} of the Combined Policy Committee on 15 April 1946 {{produced}} no accord on collaboration, and resulted in an exchange of cables between Truman and Attlee. Truman cabled on 20 April {{that he did not}} see the communiqué he had signed as obligating the United States to assist Britain in designing, constructing and operating an atomic energy plant. Attlee's response on 6 June 1946 [...] "did not mince words nor conceal his displeasure behind the nuances of diplomatic language." [...] At issue was not just technical cooperation, which was fast disappearing, but the allocation of uranium ore. During the war this was of little concern, as Britain had not needed any ore, so all the production of the Congo mines and all the ore seized by the Alsos Mission had gone to the United States, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> also required by the British atomic project. Chadwick and Groves reached an agreement by which ore would be shared equally.|$|E
500|$|In late 1942, Como {{made the}} {{decision}} to quit the Weems band, even if it meant giving up singing. He returned to Canonsburg, his family, and his trade, tired of life on the road without his wife and young son. Como received an offer to become a Frank Sinatra imitator, but chose to keep his own style. While Perry was negotiating for a store lease to re-open a barber shop, he received a call from Tommy Rockwell at General Artists Corporation, who also represented Ted Weems. Como fielded many other calls that also brought offers, but he liked and trusted Rockwell, who was offering him his own sustaining (non-sponsored) Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) radio show and offering to get him a recording contract. The offers were also appealing because it meant staying in New York with no more road tours. As Perry pondered the job offer, Roselle told him, [...] "You can always get another barber shop if it doesn't work out!" [...] Until the radio show and recording contract offers, he did not really view singing as his career, believing the years with Carlone and Weems had been enjoyable, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time to get back to work. Como said in an 1983 interview, [...] "I thought I'd have my fun and I'd go home to work." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 1969 was {{the last}} year of {{production}} for the California GS. The car was for the first time featured in Buick's big brochure. A two-page color picture of the thin pillar coupe and pictures of the again standard bench seat interior were included along with equipment descriptions. Tom McCahill tested the car and recorded a 0–60 time of 9.5 seconds and a top speed of 110mph. Again the car came with Buick's 280hp 350-4 engine <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> mated to the new Turbo 350 transmission. Custom California emblems again graced the rear fenders, and the rear marker lights were plain red without Buick's normal 350 or 400 script. Vinyl tops, as with previous years, were standard fare with the California's distinctive GS logo on the sail panel.|$|E
2500|$|The new Chancellor of Prussia, Bismarck, saw France as {{the main}} {{obstacle}} to German unification under Prussia. He adroitly managed a diplomatic crisis over the Spanish throne {{to bring about a}} war with France, which he was confident Prussia would win. The press in Paris began clamoring for war, and Napoleon's marshals assured him that France would win. Bismarck privately told his friends that his declaration to the French on the crisis [...] "had the effect of a red flag on a bull." [...] Thiers knew Bismarck well and saw clearly what Bismarck was doing. The prime minister, Emile Ollivier, spoke to the Assembly on 15 July, saying that France had done all it could to avoid war, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> inevitable, and France was well prepared and would win.|$|E
