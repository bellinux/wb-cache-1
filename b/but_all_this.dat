5|$|Until 1969, Cardiff RFC and Wales both {{played their}} home matches {{on the same}} pitch at Cardiff Arms Park, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> changed in the 1969–70 season. As {{a result of an}} {{agreement}} between Cardiff Athletic Club and the WRU, the National Stadium project established that a new stadium for international matches and events was required, with Cardiff RFC moving to a new purpose built stadium on the original cricket ground {{at the site of the}} former Cardiff Arms Park stadium. By 7 April 1984 the National Stadium was officially opened. However, in 1994, a redevelopment committee was set up to consider redeveloping the National Stadium, and by 1995 the WRU had been chosen to host the 1999 Rugby World Cup.|$|E
25|$|<b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> was for naught.

25|$|I {{found there}} were {{absolutely}} no persons holding the stations {{of what are}} called, in England, Leaders, {{on either side of}} the House.... It is true, that certain members do take charge of administration questions, and certain others of opposition questions; <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> so obviously without concert among themselves, actual or tacit, that nothing can be conceived less systematic or more completely desultory, disjointed.|$|E
25|$|<b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> was as {{yet in the}} future. Essex's {{military}} promenade in {{the west}} of England {{was the subject of}} immediate interest. At first successful, this general penetrated to Plymouth, whence, securely based as he thought, he could overrun Devon. Unfortunately for him, he was persuaded to overrun Cornwall as well. At once, the Cornishmen rose, as they had risen under Hopton, and the King was soon on the march from the Oxford region, disregarding the armed mobs under Waller and Browne.|$|E

25|$|<b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> was short-lived. In 1913 {{the plot}} {{moved on to}} the next tenant - a {{successful}} entrepreneur, the owner of the Aquarium Garden Friedrich Thomas. He built a two-storey stone Variety Theatre “Maxim’s” adjoining the mansion from the garden. The entrance to the theatre was from Kozitskiy Lane. The theatre featured light-minded shows, one-act plays, operettas, comic musical interludes and short ballets. The trouble years that followed the events of 1905 aroused an incredible yearning for shows and entertainments.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted here that the {{erection}} of episcopal conferences was as yet by no means obligatory. This, then, was a freely agreed-upon instrument of mutual help and cooperation. And as such it was in advance of most European Conferences, which were only established {{in connection with the}} Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). Rome, though praising the Scandinavian initiative by sending a high-level congratulatory telegram, did not formally recognise this or any of the existing conferences. Nor did the Holy See as yet use them as consultative bodies, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> was to come. The necessities arising from Vatican II brought about the change.|$|E
25|$|Monghyr {{was thus}} {{occupied}} by Mir Qasim Ali, the Nawab of Bengal (from 1760 to 1764). In 1763, Quasim shifted his capital from Murshidabad to Munger. His new appointee General Gurgin Khan from Isfahan patterned the Bengal Army {{on the lines}} of the British forces. At this fort, a factory for arsenal, for manufacturing of fire-arms was established. This tradition has continued to this day; several hundred families who have specialized in the manufacture of guns are continuing with this old tradition. He further added to the fortifications and also built palaces in the fort. Mir Quasim {{came to be known as}} a just ruler (he tried to eliminate corruption and injustice) but was also feared by his opponents as a fierce and ruthless warrior. He was also known for encouraging culture and had many scholars in his court. <b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> ended soon as he had serious differences on trade and other administrative practices with the British. Mir Qasim later had to use the fort as a base for waging war against the British. But he was defeated in 1764. Later, he turned out to be a poor looser as he disgraced himself by committing serious atrocities on his own people in Munger fort and also in Patna, and also on the English army and other personnel who were captured in Patna. His criminal atrocities in Patna are known in the historical annals as the ‘Massacre of Patna’. Subsequently, the fort lost its glory. Lord Cornwallis, the Governor General, in British India, had built a country house here.|$|E

25|$|After my father's {{appointment}} by {{his homeland}} as state {{official in the}} customs house of Bugia for the Pisan merchants who thronged to it, he took charge; and in view of its future usefulness and convenience, had me in my boyhood come to him and there wanted me to devote myself to and be instructed {{in the study of}} calculation for some days. There, following my introduction, as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art, to the nine digits of the Hindus, the knowledge of the art very much appealed to me before all others, and for it I realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying methods; and at these places thereafter, while on business. I pursued my study in depth and learned the give-and-take of disputation. <b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> even, and the algorism, as well as the art of Pythagoras, I considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the Hindus (Modus Indorum). Therefore, embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus, and taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of Euclid's geometric art. I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as I could, dividing it into fifteen chapters. Almost everything which I have introduced I have displayed with exact proof, in order that those further seeking this knowledge, with its pre-eminent method, might be instructed, and further, in order that the Latin people might not be discovered to be without it, as they have been up to now. If I have perchance omitted anything more or less proper or necessary, I beg indulgence, since there is no one who is blameless and utterly provident in all things. The nine Indian figures are: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. With these nine figures, and with the sign 0... any number may be written.|$|E
500|$|On 18December 1906, Bauer and Ellqvist were married. Little {{is known}} of their first years {{together}} since they now {{lived in the same}} house, making letters unnecessary. Bauer had jobs illustrating covers for magazines, like Hvar 8 Dag, and began work on Bland tomtar och troll (Among Gnomes and Trolls). In 1908, John and Ester traveled to Italy together; on their return they found a house, the [...] "Villa Björkudden", situated on the shores of Lake Bunn just outside Gränna. They bought the house in 1914, and the following year their son Bengt (called [...] "Putte") was born. The birth of Putte marked a harmonious and joyful time for the couple. Bauer made his final illustrations for Among Gnomes and Trolls, his grand farewell to the series, which freed him to explore playwriting and make frescos. He showed his paintings at exhibitions and experimented with modernism, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> came at a cost. Bauer was often away, leaving Ellqvist alone at home, and he no longer had the steady income that the illustrations had provided. By 1917, their marriage was in trouble, and in 1918, Bauer put his thoughts about a divorce {{in a letter to his}} wife.|$|E
500|$|A modern {{example of}} desert farming is the Imperial Valley in California, which has high {{temperatures}} and average rainfall of just [...] per year. [...] The economy is heavily based on agriculture {{and the land}} is irrigated through a network of canals and pipelines sourced entirely from the Colorado River via the All-American Canal. The soil is deep and fertile, {{being part of the}} river's flood plains, and what would otherwise have been desert has been transformed {{into one of the most}} productive farming regions in California. Other water from the river is piped to urban communities <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> has been at the expense of the river, which below the extraction sites no longer has any above-ground flow during most of the year. Another problem of growing crops in this way is the build-up of salinity in the soil caused by evaporation of river water. The greening of the desert remains an aspiration and was at one time viewed as a future means for increasing food production for the world's growing population. This prospect has proved false as it disregarded the environmental damage caused elsewhere by the diversion of water for desert project irrigation.|$|E

500|$|Pornographic Apathetic {{received}} positive reception from journalist Gary Dowell of The Dallas Morning News, {{who described}} it as [...] "Especially notable ... an experimental work that strips the mystique from porn". Pornographic Apathetic was selected {{for inclusion in the}} Puchon International Fantastic Festival (PiFan) in South Korea; the festival [...] "aims to identify the important elements of fantastic films, such as creativity and popularity". The movie was shown at the Paris Porn Film Fest at the Le Brady cinema, in Paris, France. The film was featured in an exhibit in Vienna, examining the nature of pornography. Writing for San Antonio Express-News, Mike Greenberg observed, [...] "T. Arthur Cottam's Pornographic Apathetic is just about the funniest thing I've ever seen. (The excellent actors are mostly clothed, never touch each other and are nearly motionless, but the dialogue is not suitable for children or bluenoses.)" [...] The film was given a favorable review by reporter Robert W. Butler of The Kansas City Star who covered the piece during its presentation at the Kansas City Filmmakers Jubilee. Butler wrote, [...] "Your ears will burn while watching T. Arthur Cottam's superlative satiric essay on the desensitizing effects of pornography, but you'll also be laughing. ... It's lurid. It's raunchy. It's vile. <b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> nasty lubricity is delivered deadpan, a device that deconstructs the whole intention of porn." [...] Marc Mohan reviewed the film during its feature at the Portland International Short Short Film Festival, and wrote that it [...] "makes the most of its one-joke premise". In 2007, The Orlando Sentinel characterized Cottam as a favorite film-maker at the Florida Film Festival. Los Angeles Times journalist Borzou Daragahi cited the film as an example of problems with the adult film industry in an article about a sexual art exhibit; he commented, [...] "The piece makes you laugh while illustrating one of the paradoxes of smut: At its core, it's rather idiotic and boring." ...|$|E

[...] He then goes further and states that Muhammad was psychologically sound in general: [...] "he (Muhammad) was clearly in full possession of his faculties to the very end of his life." [...] Watt concludes by stating [...] "It is incredible that a person subject to epilepsy, or hysteria, or even ungovernable fits of emotion, could have been the active leader of military expeditions, or the cool far-seeing guide of a city-state and a growing religious community; <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> we know Muhammad to have been." ...|$|E

[...] Miami soon got another chance to score when Larry Gordon {{recovered}} Thornton's fumble on the Steelers 5, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> resulted in was a turnover on downs. [...] Faced with 4th and 2, Griese tried to connect with tight end Bruce Hardy in the end zone, but Hardy collided with receiver Nat Moore and the pass fell incomplete. The Steelers {{had a chance to}} increase their lead even more right before halftime when they tackled Dolphins punter George Roberts on the Miami 21 before he could make a kick.

2500|$|The Casa de Cultura Jesús Reyes Heroles {{is located}} on Francisco Sosa, named after a {{historian}} and political scientist from Veracruz. The house is on a property, which was called Izotitlán, meaning “izotes” a type of wild palm to make hats. In the colonial period, the house belonged to Juan de Luis Celis who had a small paper factory. [...] It changed hands several times by the 20th century, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> time, the structure kept its original appearance including very old atrium cross in the first courtyard. In the 1940s, it was enlarged, but its colonial style was respected.
