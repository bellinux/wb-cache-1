60|$|So far {{as school}} {{education}} is concerned, I {{want to go}} no further just now; and I believe that such instruction would make an excellent introduction to that preparatory scientific training which, as I have indicated, is so essential for the successful pursuit of our most important professions. But this modicum of instruction must be so given as to ensure real knowledge and practical discipline. If scientific education is {{to be dealt with}} as mere <b>bookwork,</b> it will be better not to attempt it, but to stick to the Latin Grammar which makes no pretence to be anything but <b>bookwork.</b>|$|E
60|$|It is {{impossible}} to insist too strongly upon the fact that efficient teachers of science and of technology {{are not to be}} made by the processes in vogue at ordinary training colleges. The memory loaded with mere <b>bookwork</b> is not the thing wanted--is, in fact, rather worse than useless--in the teacher of scientific subjects. It is absolutely essential that his mind should be full of knowledge and not of mere learning, and that what he knows should have been learned in the laboratory rather than in the library.|$|E

It is absolutely essential that his mind should be full of knowledge and not of mere learning, and that what he knows should have been learned in the laboratory rather than in the library. There are happily already, both in London and in the provinces, various places in which such training is to be had, and the main thing at present is {{to make it in the}} first place accessible, and in the next [234] indispensable, to those who undertake the business of teaching. But when the well-trained men are supplied, it must be recollected that the profession of teacher is not a very lucrative or otherwise tempting one, and that it may be advisable to offer special inducements to good men to remain in it. These, however, are questions of detail into which it is unnecessary to enter further.|$|E

60|$|Steve {{returned}} to the lodgings just as the captain and first mate came in to dinner. Then he carried one of his canvas suits down to the ship, put it on, and was soon at work having his first lesson in seizing ropes. For a fortnight the work continued, and Stephen greatly pleased the captain and first mate by his attention and willingness, working all the time as a rigger’s boy, and paying the greatest attention to all the minutiae of the work. Saturday afternoons and Sundays he spent at Mr. Hewson’s, where his father was still staying, his host refusing to listen to any talk of his leaving until the Tiger sailed. Another four days were spent in planing decks and painting inside and out. The work was scarcely finished when the cargo began to come on board. As soon as this was the case, {{the second and third}} mates and the other two apprentices joined. Like Mr. Staines, Towel and Pasley, the second and third mates, had both made their way up from the forecastle; both were active young men and good sailors, who had laboriously mastered the very small amount of <b>bookwork</b> that was needed, in addition to practical seamanship, to pass their examinations, but who, like the majority of their class of that time, knew nothing of navigation beyond taking a rough observation at mid-day and working it out by rule of thumb on the tables. Mr. Staines presented Stephen to them.|$|E

50|$|The {{early history}} {{is of the}} gradual {{replacement}} {{during the middle of}} the eighteenth century of a traditional method of oral examination by written papers, with a simultaneous switch in emphasis from Latin disputation to mathematical questions. That is, all degree candidates were expected to show at least competence in mathematics. A long process of development of coaching—tuition usually outside the official University and college courses—went hand-in-hand with a gradual increase in the difficulty of the most testing questions asked. The standard examination pattern of <b>bookwork</b> (mostly memorised theorems) plus rider (problems to solve, testing comprehension of the <b>bookwork)</b> was introduced.|$|E

The newsletter recounts that RPW founder Nancy David (who had been a student in the silkscreen and lithography classes taught by Marilyn Bevilacqua at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Studio School) received a technical assistance grant from the Virginia Commission for the Arts to attend the <b>Bookworks</b> 82 Conference held at the Moore College of Art in Philadelphia, [...] "a meeting for artists, writers, and publishers of small and unique editions." [...] Also attending <b>Bookworks</b> 82 as panelists were Bruce Schnabel, an RPW bookbinding instructor, and Janet Dalberto of the Special Collections Department of Virginia Commonwealth Universitys Cabell Library. Richmond representatives to <b>Bookworks</b> 82 viewed an exhibition by the Philadelphia Print Club of one-of-a-kind (i.e. one/off) books, many of handmade paper.|$|R

5000|$|Over {{the course}} of the last 12 years, using an Olivetti typewriter, Liversidge has created {{proposals}} for exhibitions that range from the simple to the impossible. He experiments with what he describes as the [...] "notion of creativity", often realised as objects, performances, or happenings over {{the course of}} an exhibition. Liversidge says of his proposals that: [...] ".. it's important that some of the proposals are actually realized, but no more so that the others that remain only as text on a piece of A4 paper. In a sense they are all possible and the <b>bookwork</b> that collates the proposals allows the reader to curate their own show, and because of its size and scale the <b>bookwork</b> allows an individual to interact with each of the proposals on their own terms, one to one." ...|$|E
