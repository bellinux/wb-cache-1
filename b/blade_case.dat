40|$|Due to the {{requirements}} for high blade loading, modern turbo‐machine blades operate {{very close to the}} stall regime. This can lead to flow separation with periodic shedding of vortices, which could lead to self induced oscillations or stall flutter of the blades. Previous studies on stall flutter have focused on flows at high Reynolds number (Re ~ 106). The Reynolds numbers for fans/propellers of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), high altitude turbofans and small wind turbines are substantially lower (Re < 105). Aerodynamic characteristics of flows at such low Re is significantly different from those at high Re, {{due in part to the}} early separation of the flow and possible formation of laminar separation bubbles (LSB). The present study is targeted towards study of stall flutter in a cascade of blades at low Re. We experimentally study stall flutter of a cascade of symmetric NACA 0012 blades at low Reynolds number (Re ~ 30, 000) through forced sinusoidal pitching of the blades about mean angles of incidences close to stall. The experimental arrangement permits variations of the inter‐blade phase (σ) in addition to the oscillation frequency (f) and amplitude; the inter‐blade phase angle (σ) being the phase difference between the motions of adjacent blades in the cascade. The unsteady moments on the central blade in the cascade are directly measured, and used to calculate the energy transfer from the flow to the blade. This energy transfer is used to predict the propensity of the blades to undergo self‐induced oscillations or stall flutter. Experiments are also conducted on an isolated blade in addition to the cascade. A variety of parameters can influence stall flutter in a cascade, namely the oscillation frequency (f), the mean angle of incidence, and the inter‐blade phase angle (σ). The measurements show that there exists a range of reduced frequencies, k (=πfc/U, c being the chord length of the blade and U being the free stream velocity), where the energy transfer from the flow to the blade is positive, which indicates that the flow can excite the blade. Above and below this range, the energy transfer is negative indicating that blade excitations, if any, will get damped. This range of excitation is found to depend upon the mean angle of incidence, with shifts towards higher values of k as the mean angle of incidence increases. An important parameter for cascades, which is absent in the isolated <b>blade</b> <b>case</b> is the inter‐blade phase angle (σ). An excitation regime is observed only for σ values between ‐ 450 and 900, with the value of excitation being maximum for σ of 900. Time traces of the measured moment were found to be non‐sinusoidal in the excitation regime, whereas they appear to be sinusoidal in the damping regime. Stall flutter in a cascade has differences when compared with an isolated blade. For the cascade, the maximum value of excitation (positive energy transfer) is found to be an order of magnitude lower compared to the isolated <b>blade</b> <b>case.</b> Further, for similar values of mean incidence angle, the range of excitation is at lower reduced frequencies for a cascade when compared with an isolated blade. A comparison with un‐stalled or classical flutter in a cascade at high Re, shows that the inter‐blade phase angle is a major factor governing flutter in both cases. Some differences are observed as well, which appear to be due to stalled flow and low Re...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{introduces the}} process of optimizing active twist rotor blades {{in the presence of}} embedded anisotropic piezo-composite actuators. Optimum design of active twist blades is a complex task, since it involves a rich design space with tightly coupled design variables. The study presents the development of an optimization framework for active helicopter rotor blade cross-sectional design. This optimization framework allows for exploring a rich and highly nonlinear design space in order to optimize the active twist rotor blades. Different analytical components are combined in the framework: cross-sectional analysis (UM/VABS), an automated mesh generator, a beam solver (DYMORE), a three-dimensional local strain recovery module, and a gradient based optimizer within MATLAB. Through the mathematical optimization problem, the static twist actuation performance of a blade is maximized while satisfying a series of blade constraints. These constraints are associated with locations of the center of gravity and elastic axis, blade mass per unit span, fundamental rotating blade frequencies, and the blade strength based on local three-dimensional strain fields under worst loading conditions. Through pre-processing, limitations of the proposed process have been studied. When limitations were detected, resolution strategies were proposed. These include mesh overlapping, element distortion, trailing edge tab modeling, electrode modeling and foam implementation of the mesh generator, and the initial point sensibility of the current optimization scheme. Examples demonstrate the effectiveness of this process. Optimization studies were performed on the NASA/Army/MIT ATR <b>blade</b> <b>case.</b> Even though that design was built and shown significant impact in vibration reduction, the proposed optimization process showed that the design could be improved significantly. The second example, based on a model scale of the AH- 64 D Apache blade, emphasized the capability of this framework to explore the nonlinear design space of complex planform. Especially for this case, detailed design is carried out to make the actual blade manufacturable. The proposed optimization framework is shown to be an effective tool to design high authority active twist blades to reduce vibration in future helicopter rotor blades...|$|E

(April 2009) Brad Evin Burgess Department of Aerospace Engineering Texas A&M University Research Advisor: Dr. Amine Benzerga Department of Aerospace Engineering Aircraft are {{becoming}} extremely {{complex in the}} modern age. Fueled by the advent of new technology, a modern plane?s makeup and structure are changing considerably. Recently the idea to utilize a greater amount of composite materials in creating {{the next generation of}} aircraft has surfaced, creating a demand for detailed analysis of these materials. Specifically, the composite fan blade cases on turbofan engines, which protect the greater structure of the aircraft, have come under scrutiny. The cases consist of a carbon fiber resin matrix. The resin can be any {{one of a number of}} epoxies, most germane of which is E 862. This resin has the effect of strengthening the overall casing structure, but the full nature of its use has yet to be acquired. This information would drastically improve the overall understanding of the uses and implications of E 862 in an aerospace environment. During the summer of 2008, extensive tensile testing was conducted on notched E 862 specimens at NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. It was discovered that the behavior of E 862 in tension and fracture was drastically affected by the temperature of the specimen as well as the presence of thermal aging. Specifically, the specimens tested at higher temperatures appeared to yield at lower stress levels, and the aged specimens yielded at higher stress levels. While this testing and analysis exposed a number of interesting material parameters and behaviors, more research must be accomplished before a full understanding can be achieved. The specific fracture mechanics of the resin E 862 is a major area of research which must still be considered. This research involves SEM analysis of the fracture surfaces of the test specimens as well as advanced modeling of the fracture using Abacus software and FEM analysis. Once completed, this vital research will serve as a basis through which a more thorough understanding of the fan <b>blade</b> <b>case</b> structure can be gained, and therefore a safer, more structurally sound aircraft will be attainable.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation of}} the flow and heat transfer characteristics of tip leakage in a typical film cooled industrial gas turbine rotor is presented in this paper. The computations were performed on a rotating domain of a single blade with a clearance gap of 1. 28 % chord in an engine environment. This standard blade featured two coolant and two dust holes, in a cavity-type tip with a central rib. The computations were performed using CFX 5. 6, which was validated for similar flow situations by Krishnababu et ai, [18]. These predictions were further verified by comparing the flow and heat transfer characteristics computed {{in the absence of}} coolant ejection with computations previously performed in the company (SIEMENS) using standard in-house codes. Turbulence was modelled using the SST k-co turbulence model. The comparison of calculations performed with and without coolant ejection has shown that the coolant flow partially blocks the tip gap, resulting in a reduction of the amount of mainstream leakage flow. The calculations identified that the main detrimental heat transfer issues were caused by impingement of the hot leakage flow onto the tip. Hence three different modifications (referred as Cases 1 to 3) were made to the standard blade tip in an attempt to reduce the tip gap exit mass flow and the associated impingement heat transfer. The improvements and limitations of the modified geometries, in terms of tip gap exit mass flow, total area of the tip affected by the hot flow and the total heat flux to the tip, are discussed. The main feature of the Case 1 geometry is the removal of the rib and this modification was found to effectively reduce both the total area affected by the hot leakage flow and total heat flux to the tip while maintaining the same leakage mass flow as the standard <b>blade.</b> <b>Case</b> 2 featured a rearrangement of the dust holes in the tip which, in terms of aero-thermal-dynamics, proved to be marginally inferior to Case 1. Case 3, which essentially created a suction-side squealer geometry, was found to be inferior even to the standard cavity tip blade. It was also found that the hot spots which occur in the leading edge region of the standard tip and all modifications contributed significantly to the area affected by the hot tip leakage flow and the total heat flux...|$|E

40|$|Current {{design of}} high {{performance}} turbopumps for rocket engines requires effective and robust analytical tools to provide design impact in a productive manner. The main {{goal of this}} study is to develop a robust and effective computational fluid dynamics (CFD) pump model for general turbopump design and analysis applications. A Finite Difference Navier-Stokes flow solver, FDNS, which includes the extended k-epsilon turbulence model and appropriate moving interface boundary conditions, was developed to analyze turbulent flows in turbomachinery devices. A second-order central difference scheme plus adaptive dissipation terms was employed in the FDNS code, along with a predictor plus multi-corrector pressure-based solution procedure. The multi-zone, multi-block capability allows the FDNS code to efficiently solve flow fields with complicated geometry. The FDNS code has been benchmarked by analyzing the pump consortium inducer, and it provided satisfactory results. In the present study, a CFD parametric study of the pump consortium impeller was conducted using the FDNS code. The pump consortium impeller, with partial blades, is a new design concept of the advanced rocket engines. The parametric study was to analyze the baseline design of the consortium impeller and its modification which utilizes TANDEM blades. In the present study, the TANDEM blade configuration of the consortium impeller considers cut full blades for about one quarter chord length from the leading edge and clocks the leading edge portion with an angle of 7. 5 or 22. 5 degrees. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effect and trend of the TANDEM blade modification and provide the result as a design guideline. A 3 -D flow analysis, with a 103 x 23 x 30 mesh grid system and with the inlet flow conditions measured by Rocketdyne, was performed for the baseline consortium impeller. The numerical result shows that the mass flow rate splits through various blade passages are relatively uniform. Due to the complexity of blade geometries, the TANDEM blade configurations were analyzed with the multi-zone grid structure. Both the 7. 5 deg- and the 22. 5 deg-clocking TANDEM <b>blade</b> <b>cases</b> utilized a 80 K mesh system. The numerical result of two TANDEM blade modifications indicates the efficiency and the head are worse than those of the baseline case due to larger flow distortion. The gap between the TANDEM blade and the full blade allows the flow passes through and heavily loads the pressure side of the partial blade such that flow reversal occurs near the suction side of the splitter. The flow split at the exit of impeller blades is very non-uniform for TANDEM <b>blade</b> <b>cases,</b> and this will greatly induce the side load on the diffuser. Therefore, the TANDEM blade modification in the present CFD analysis does not improve the performance of the consortium impeller...|$|R

Flow field surveys have been conducted in a low-speed, linear compressor cascade. Pressure, velocity, and loss have been measured via a five-hole probe, pitot probe, and pressure taps on the blades. Four different roughness magnitudes, Ra values of 0. 38 lm (polished), 1. 70 lm (baseline), 2. 03 lm (rough 1), and 2. 89 lm (rough 2), have been tested. Furthermore, various roughness locations have been examined. In addition to the as manufactured (baseline) and entirely rough <b>blade</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>blades</b> with roughness covering the leading edge, pressure side, and 5 %, 20 %, 35 %, 50 %, and 100 % of suction side from the leading edge have been studied. All of the tests {{have been carried out}} for Reynolds numbers ranging from 300, 000 to 640, 000. For Reynolds numbers under 500, 000, the tested roughnesses do not significantly degrade compressor blade loading or loss. However, loss and blade loading become sensitive to roughness at Reynolds numbers above 550, 000. Cascade performance is more sensitive to roughness on the suction side than pressure side. Furthermore, roughness on the aft 2 = 3 of suction side surface has a greater influence on loss. For a given roughness location, there exists a Reynolds number at which loss begins to significantly increase. Finally, increasing the roughness area on the suction surface from the leading edge reduces the Reynolds number at which the loss begins to increase.
