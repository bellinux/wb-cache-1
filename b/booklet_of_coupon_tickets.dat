40|$|Electronic multicoupons are {{the digital}} version <b>of</b> paper-based <b>booklet</b> <b>of</b> <b>coupons,</b> which allow a {{customer}} to obtain {{goods or services}} from a merchant typically with discounts or gifts. In this paper, we propose a multicoupon scheme for multi-merchant environments that enhances the security and the efficiency as regards the previous solution that deals {{with this kind of}} scenario. On one hand, our scheme meets basic security requirements (unforgeability, reuse detection), but also unsplittability. This fact will help to increase the trust on the part of merchants. On the other hand, we focus on achieving a high degree of privacy for customers (anonymity, unlinkability, confidentiality) that will contribute to gaining the trust of the involved customers. Moreover, we provide measures to protect honest parties from dishonest participants, keeping in mind the scalability and efficiency of the multicoupon scheme, to attract customers and merchants. In addition, we show by implementation that our proposal outperforms previous solutions of this kind...|$|R
5000|$|Coupon {{parking is}} a {{variation}} of pay and display {{without the use of}} machines; instead, the motorist purchases a <b>booklet</b> <b>of</b> <b>coupons</b> in advance from the authorities. To use a parking coupon, the motorist has to completely tear off tabs of the date and time, or scratch off panels on the date and time in which he/she leaves the vehicle. This process is similar to disc parking, except that a parking disc is reusable whereas a coupon can only be used once. In the Republic of Ireland, reusable free-parking discs are unknown and parking coupons are called [...] "parking discs". [...] The coupon is displayed on the dashboard or hung from the top of a door window facing the roadside. Multiple coupons are used if the parking time exceeds the allowance given for a single coupon, though this is not always permitted. The system is widely used in Singapore and Brazil, and in parts of some countries such as New Zealand, Malaysia, Austria, Ireland and Israel.|$|R

The model also incorporates the effects of retailer promotions that often accompany a coupon program.

40|$|Abstract — Motivated by {{the study}} of {{peer-to-peer}} file swarming systems à la BitTorrent, we introduce a probabilistic model <b>of</b> <b>coupon</b> replication systems. These systems consist of users, aiming to complete a collection <b>of</b> distinct <b>coupons.</b> Users are characterised by their current collection <b>of</b> <b>coupons,</b> and leave the system once they complete their coupon collection. The system evolution is then specified by describing how users of distinct types meet, and which coupons get replicated upon such encounters. For open systems, with exogenous user arrivals, we derive necessary and sufficient stability conditions in a layered scenario, where encounters are between users holding the same number <b>of</b> <b>coupons.</b> We also consider a system where encounters are between users chosen uniformly at random from the whole population. We show that performance, captured by sojourn time, is asymptotically optimal in both systems as the number <b>of</b> <b>coupon</b> types becomes large. We also consider closed systems with no exogenous user arrivals. In a special scenario where users have only one missing coupon, we evaluate {{the size of the}} population ultimately remaining in the system, as the initial number of users, N, goes to infinity. We show that this decreases geometrically with the number <b>of</b> <b>coupons,</b> K. In particular, when the ratio K / log(N) is above a critical threshold, we prove that this number of leftovers is of order log(log(N)). These results suggest that performance of file swarming systems does not depend critically on either altruistic user behavior, or on load balancing strategies such as rarest first. I...|$|R
