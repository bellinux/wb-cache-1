5000|$|At present, {{the lake}} is best suited to shallow draft power boats due to {{a large number of}} trees and stumps that are still {{in the body of the}} lake. Although there are {{numerous}} well marked <b>boat</b> <b>lanes</b> that have been cleared of stumps and trees, one should use caution even on the boat lanes; one should use extreme caution when off the <b>boat</b> <b>lanes</b> and maintain a watch for stumps and/or trees as well as floating logs.http://www.toledo-bend.com/toledo_bend/index.asp?request=buoys ...|$|R

5000|$|A race {{normally}} {{covers a}} distance of 5.5 km with either a single trip to a buoy and back two return trips. Each boat has its own lane and may not cross into another <b>boat's</b> <b>lane</b> and the oars (and boats) of different boats may not touch. A race is normally restarted if something irregular happens within the first 20 seconds of a race. Apart from the prize money for each race, the winning team is awarded a bandera (flag) of the town or autonomous community. The winning team traditionally holds all oars vertically into the air, the so-called remos arriba or arraunak gora, [...] "oars up".|$|R
50|$|Standedge Tunnel {{proved to}} be a {{bottleneck}} having been constructed without a towpath. Narrowboats had to be 'legged' through, eventually by professionally employed leggers. A company employee would chain the tunnel entrance behind a convoy of boats and walk over <b>Boat</b> <b>Lane,</b> accompanied by boat boys and girls leading the boat horses, to unchain {{the opposite end of the}} tunnel before the boat convoy arrived. This journey was made at least twice per day for over twenty years.|$|E

5000|$|Within two years, the Authority {{dismissed}} Fowler {{from his}} position amid allegations of hiring friends and relatives, including his son. Fowler was accused of spending the limited funds of the Authority on questionable undertakings, rather than access roads and <b>boat</b> <b>lanes.</b> He was also accused of circumventing state bid laws. The Authority announced on March 10, 1989, that Fowler's two-year contract would not be renewed {{and that he would}} be replaced by William Kratz, a then 66-year-old university mathematics instructor. Fowler's salary continued through March 31, 1989, when his three-year contract lapsed.

[...] They built many of the boats used on the canals of southern England before closing in about 1950. Next to the wharf is the Barge Inn, a substantial public house once known as the George Inn. It was roughly half-way along the canal and served as a bakehouse, slaughterhouse and shop for provisions for those living and working on the canal.

50|$|There {{was nothing}} glamorous about Rogers's {{deployment}} to Hollywood Barracks, Belfast, in 1970 {{once again on}} internal security duties, this time in Ireland. Adaptable as ever, the Battery requisitioned a tin hut and a club-house for accommodation. Initially the Battery had deployed to cover the marching season, but this was soon extended to a full four-month tour. The {{early part of the}} tour was active for all the Battery in terms of riot control, but {{the latter half of the}} tour was more sedate with the soldiers helping families recover from the terrible flooding that hit south Belfast. In September the Battery was redeployed to take responsibility for Andersonstown as part of the Whiterock AOR (area of operational responsibility). Two years later the Battery was posted back to Ireland, again in a dismounted role, but this time to Derry to protect the docks and commercial centre of the City. The first major incident that they had to deal with was a car bomb: the car was parked up at <b>Boating</b> Club <b>Lane</b> but the bombers gave a different location in their warning which the Battery duly cleared. The incident passed fortunately without injury to anybody but it anybody but it set the tone for the disturbances that took place over Christmas that year culminating in the Strand bombing.|$|R

40|$|The author {{examines}} {{our current}} transportation system from a whole systems perspective. The examination includes {{an evaluation of}} the current system's performance under four criteria. In four appendices, the questions of whether the current system is clean, affordable, safe and efficient are explored. An alternate system is described {{in the body of the}} paper, with comparisons for each of the measurement criteria found in the appendices. A discussion of the necessary steps for a transition from one system to another follows. Issues explored include infrastructure logistics, economic impacts, and changes in community dynamics. Regulatory, finance, and policy tools available to facilitate the transition with minimum disruption are discussed as well. Taking a Whole Systems Approach Every region of the world has a transportation system created in response to the politics, economics, culture and physical characteristics of that region. All have common components: infrastructure, technology, institutions and values. Many remote Alaska villages have no road access and rely instead on riverboats, bush planes, ATVs and snowmobiles. The city of Venice, Italy moves its three hundred thousand plus residents and thousands of tourists by canal <b>boats</b> and pedestrian <b>lanes,</b> virtually car-free. In the continental US, our system can best be described as auto-centric, with public transit, air traffic, trains, and ferries supplementing the use of private motor vehicles. The evolution and impacts of this system have been thoroughly examined by critics, supporters, and reformers. Almost without exception, transportation analysts approach our complex system from a specialized interest perspective. As a result, there is a great deal of information available about the environment [...] ...|$|R
