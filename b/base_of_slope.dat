The interpretation is based on their close association {{with a variety of}} mass flow deposits ranging from limestone conglomerates to calcarenites and deep-water, plane-bedded micritic limestone devoid f current- or wave-generated structures as well as detritus coarser than fine silt. These deposits occur within a major transgressive succession. The <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> origin of stratiform manganese deposits is uncommon in the rock record and their origin is to be constrained against the background of baseof slope depositional setting. Sedimentary manganese ores are known to accumulate in highly variable depositional milieu from lacustrine to oceanic settings (Roy 1981, 1988). They are found in both shallow-and deep-water settings at present, whereas shelf-related epositional regime appears to represent the most favoured site of manganese deposition in the rock record (Beukes 1983...|$|E

The spatial relationship between the six recognized seismic facies and their variations distant from the actual drill holes also facilitates interpretation of tectonic and sedimentologic processes responsible for generation of the continental slope. <b>Base</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> structures ob-served {{in the vicinity of}} a large submarine canyon are evidence for accretion of trench turbidites into the lower slope with significant deformation and rotation to high angles within 4 km of the trench axis.

Because Leg 66 drill-ing was concentrated near a major canyon that has been supplying turbidites to the trench since the late Miocene, slope generation is interpreted as the result of addition of trench deposits to the lower slope. Since the cross-sectional area is similar among areas with and without trench turbidites, other processes may be responsible for adding sediments to the accretionary zone. One such process may be the incorporation of slope deposits by incipient deformation, which is ob-served in some of the drill sites. The regional uplift may result from material added to the margin by accretion at deeper structural levels...|$|E

On the continental {{rise of the}} Gulf of Lions (Western Mediterranean), an aseismic area, we identified turbiditic beds deposited during the rising stage and highstand of sea level. Swath bathymetry, sediment cores, in situ Cone Penetrating Tests (CPTU), heavy mineral associations and radiocarbon dating determined the source, composition, distribution and age of the turbiditic beds. Turbidites are composed of homogeneous to positively graded silts to medium sand with quartz (up to 90 %), shell debris and shelfal benthic faunas. Their distribution on the sea floor is very patchy and controlled by abundant inherited erosional bedforms. Their source is found in relict regressive sands at the outershelf. Their deposition occurred just after {{the onset of the}} post-glacial sea level rise and the concomitant sediment starvation of the Rhône deep sea turbiditic system until recently. Whilst canyons are fed with sand by strong seasonal hydro-sedimentary dynamics on the outershelf, the emplacement of post-glacial turbidites is not controlled by sea level changes but probably by the periodic flushing of the canyons.

The {{subject of}} this paper aims to present the {{characteristics}} of extreme hydrological phenomena form Prăpăstiilor Drainage Basin. Prăpăstiilor Drainage Basin is situated in the north-eastern part of Piatra CraiuluiMountains, eastern Carpathians. The structural conformation, given {{by the presence of}} Piatra Craiului syncline and by the limestone-conglomerate lithologic pattern, determines certain characteristics of the hydrographic network, which is mostly temporary, because of the water infiltration into the substrate. The springs, which provide permanent flow to the network, occur only on the syncline axis and at the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> deposits. When entering the gorge areas, they disappear in the same substrate, and reappear as springs, downstream of the gorges. Thus, because of these aspects, over which climate elements overlap, during periods of heavy rain, extreme events like floods frequently occur in different sectors. Effects on the environment components are complex. The floods accelerate the erosion, can affect the forest roads, construction or isolated houses along water bodies.

40|$|Reflection of {{internal}} waves from sloping topography is simple to predict for uniform stratification and linear slope gradients. However, depth-varying stratification presents the complication that {{regions of the}} slope may be subcritical and other regions supercritical. Here, a numerical model is used to simulate a mode- 1, M 2 internal tide approaching a shelf slope with both uniform and depth-varying stratifications. The fractions of incident internal wave energy reflected back offshore and transmitted onto the shelf are diagnosed by calculating the energy flux at the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> (with and without topography) and at the shelf break. For the stratifications/topographies considered in this study, the fraction of energy reflected for a given slope criticality is similar for both uniform and depth-varying stratifications. This suggests the fraction reflected is dependent only on maximum slope criticality and independent of {{the depth of the}} pycnocline. The majority of the reflected energy flux is in mode 1, with only minor contributions from higher modes due to topographic scattering. The fraction of energy transmitted is dependent on the depth-structure of the stratification and cannot be predicted from maximum criticality. If near-surface stratification is weak, transmitted internal waves may not reach the shelf break due to decreased horizontal wavelength and group velocity...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The Cretaceous–Paleogene Tres Pasos and Dorotea {{formations}} of the Magallanes Basin, Chile {{record the}} filling of a deep-water foreland setting. Slope clinoforms {{with at least}} 700 – 900 m relief (compacted) prograded southward along the foredeep axis, which was oriented parallel to the adjacent Patagonian Andes. Fluvial- and wave-influenced deltaic deposits of the Dorotea Formation represent the upper, flat portions of the sigmoidal slope profiles. The paleo-shelf edge is estimated where shelf sandstones pinch-out basinward. Mudstone, siltstone, and a notable paucity of sandstone characterize upper slope strata. Further down-slope, conduits are evidenced by sedimentary bodies associated with cross-stratified or normally graded sandy conglomerate and local mudstone rip-up clasts, interpreted to indicate that considerable sediment bypassed the slope. Turbiditic sandstones and mass-transport deposits of the Tres Pasos Formation characterize the lower to <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> setting. Numerous examples of slope clinoforms have been recognized in the rock record, with the majority characterized by 200 – 500 m of estimated paleo-relief. Higher relief examples include those mapped in outcrop from the Magallanes Basin documented here, and comparable clinoforms from the subsurface Cretaceous Brookian succession of the North Slope, Alaska. In the Magallanes Basin, numerous factors contributed {{to the development of}} high-relief clinoforms, including generation of substantial basin margin relief, the absence of mobile substrata, adequate sediment supply, and the elongate basin shape. The slope that built and maintained the relatively smooth clinoform profile was narrow, and thus, sediment that was transported across the shelf was focused as it passed into deeper water. In general, the development of slope clinoforms, including high-relie...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: How the {{processes}} that initiate turbidity currents influence turbidite deposition is poorly understood, and many discussions in the literature rely on concepts that are overly simplistic. Marine geological studies provide information on the initiation and flow path of turbidity currents, including their response to gradient. In case studies of late Quaternary turbidites on the eastern Canadian and western U. S. margins, initiation processes are inferred either from real-time data for historical flows or indirectly from the age and contemporary paleogeography, erosional features, and depositional record. Three major types of initiation process are recognized: transformation of failed sediment, hyperpycnal flow from rivers or ice margins, and resuspension of sediment near the shelf edge by oceanographic processes. Many high-concentration flows result from hyperpycnal supply of hyperconcentrated bedload, or liquefaction failure of coarse-grained sediment, and most tend to deposit in slope conduits and on gradients, 0. 5 u at the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> and on the mid fan. Highly turbulent flows, from transformation of retrogressive failures and from ignitive flows that are triggered by oceanographic processes, tend to cannibalize these more proximal sediments and redeposit them on lower gradients on the basin plain. Such conduit flushing provides most of the sediment in large turbidites. Initiation mechanism exerts a strong control on the duration of turbidity flows. In most basins, there is a complex feedback between different types of turbidity-current initiation, {{the transformation of the}} flows, and the associated slope morphology. As a result, there is no simple relationship between initiating process and type of deposit...|$|E

Only the roof of the Bay Complex, which consists of microtonalite and granodiorite, is exposed. The Glen Complex, of uncertain form, comprises quartz porphyry, porphyritic quartzmicrodiorite and quartz-microdiorite. Exposure is good along the shore line, but much of the area is covered in thick, dmmlinised drift. Local high chargeability zones were identified along three geophysical traverse lines. Soil samples were collected on a 50 m grid over the area of IP anomalies. In addition, water, <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> talus, and rock samples were chemically analysed Both the intrusion complexes and some of the sedimentary rocks show locally intense hydrothermal alteration. In the Bay Complex narrow zones of bleached rock are rich in calcite, chlorite and pyrite and contain minor chalcopyrite and pyzrhotite. The Glen Complex displays network fracturing, brecciation and locally intense alteration to sericite or calcite. There is locally abundant pyrite in veins and disseminated and rare chalcopyrite. Arsenopyrite is present in wall rock adjacent to the Bay Complex. Rock geochemistry indicates a pervasive but patchy Cu-Fe-As-MO mineralisation in all rock types, with copper enrichment greatest in the Bay Complex where the highest level recorded is over 600 ppm Cu. The mineralisation is accompanied by irregular barium, potassium and strontium enrichment. The K/Rb ratios suggest that the hydrothermal liquors were not entirely late magmatic.

Deep-water flow (below 3000 m) has produced a symmetrical sediment drift on the trough floor, with non-depositional margins indicating higher current velocities at the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope.</b> To the southeast of the Falkland Islands there is {{a gap in the}} North Scotia Ridge, north of which the floor of the trough is swept clean of sediment by the ACC. Both echo character mapping and GLORIA side-scan data indicate that currents follow the bathymetric contours along the slope, redistributing sediment and locally eroding furrows. From six cores on the drift and on the northern slope, two styles of contourite deposition have been identified. On the drift, Holocene biogenic sandy contourites overlie Last Glacial Maximum muddy contourites and fine-grained diatomaceous hemipelagites. Sedimentation rates here average 3 – 4 cm ka− 1. The sandy contourites present in four of the cores from the sediment drift are sharply underlain by the finer-grained, diatomaceous hemipelagites. The lack of a coarsening upward sequence, commonly associated with an increase in current velocity may be indicative of high current activity eroding away the finer (negative) sequence. Pliocene and Mid-Pleistocene glaucony-rich sandy contourites containing radiolaria characterise the Falkland Plateau and the floor of the trough near the gap in the North Scotia Ridge. We suggest that the glaucony is derived from a combination of authigenic formation and erosion of locally outcropping Cretaceous and Tertiary strata; this is supported by dinoflagellate analysis.

This provides {{a challenge to}} accurate 3 D modelling, particularly in representing lithofacies transitions within sand-poor areas. In this paper, traditional (sedimentary logs, palaeocurrent measurements, architectural panels) and non-conventional technologies (Light Detection and Ranging; Ground Penetrating Radar) were integrated to quantitatively describe lithofacies distributions and sedimentary architectures from two large-scale outcrops, one <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope,</b> high sandstone content system (Unit B) and one from a mid-slope, more mixed lithology system (Unit C), in the Laingsburg Formation, Karoo Basin, South Africa. The workflow described in this study combines digital structural restoration and extrapolation of major stratigraphic surfaces, grouped palaeocurrents and architectural geometries observed at outcrop to create 3 D digital models. The model was divided into zones along major stratigraphic discontinuities and populated using lithofacies associations that were adjusted for outcrop rugosity and palaeodispersal direction. Observed channel margin asymmetries, distribution of lithofacies and stacking patterns were all honoured in the digital models. The Unit C slope-channel system differs from many exposed submarine channels due to the low proportion of sandstone present within the infill. Thin-bedded channel margin lithofacies are preserved through the lateral stepping of channels and allow the correlation of stratigraphy from channel axis to margin and on to overbank areas. In the older, sandier Unit B base-of-slope system, the stratigraphic change in stacking pattern, channel aspect ratio, lithofacies of channel-fills and stratigraphic hierarchy were all captured.

Here, an exhumed sand-prone succession (> 80 % sandstone) from Sub-unit C 3 of the Permian Fort Brown Formation, Laingsburg depocenter, Karoo Basin, South Africa, is interpreted as a frontal-lobe complex, constrained by its sedimentology, geometry, and stratigraphic context. Sub-unit C 3 crops out {{as a series of}} sand-prone wedges. Individual beds can be followed for up to 700 m as they thin, fine, and downlap onto the underlying mudstone. The downlap pattern, absence of major erosion surfaces or truncation, and constant thickness of underlying units indicates that the wedges are non-erosional depositional bodies. Their low aspect ratio and mounded geometry contrasts markedly with architecture of terminal lobes on the basin floor. Furthermore their sedimentology is dominated by decimeter-scale sinusoidal stoss-side preserved bedforms with a range of low-angle to high-angle climbing-ripple laminated fine-grained sandstones. This indicates that the flows deposited their load rapidly close to, and downstream from, an abrupt decrease in confinement. The sedimentology, stratigraphy, crosssectional geometry, and weakly confined setting of a sand-prone system from the Giza Field, Nile Delta, is considered a close subsurface analogue, and their shared characteristics are used to establish diagnostic criteria for the identification and prediction of frontal-lobe deposits. In addition, deposits with similar facies characteristics have been found at the bases of large external levee deposits in the Fort Brown Formation (Unit D). This could support models in which frontal lobes form an initial depositional template above which external levees build, which provides further insight into the initiation and evolution of submarine channels...|$|E

Based on their peculiar facies characteristics, it can be documented that both units include the 1 st to 7 th evaporitic cycles of the Primary Lower Gypsum (PLG) unit recognized throughout the Mediterranean and marking {{the onset of the}} Messinian salinity crisis. In other words, massive selenite deposits of the lower and upper unit are identical and belong to a largely incomplete, top-missing PLG unit. As a consequence, we argue that their vertical superposition is not stratigraphic and a suitable tectonic or gravitative duplication mechanism of the local Messinian succession has to be envisaged. The lower evaporitic unit actually consists of an array of PLG tilted blocks which are onlapped by mainly clastic gypsum deposits. We interpret this succession as a <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> complex formed in front of a thrust-related anticline undergoing uplift and progressive dismantling through large-scale mass-wasting processes during a intra-Messinian phase of tectonic activity. This unit is a perfect equivalent of the Resedimented Lower Gypsum (RLG) deposits found in many other deep Mediterranean basins. In this context, also the upper evaporitic unit is here considered a huge PLG slab emplaced on top of the lower one through mainly gravitative processes related to retrogressive sliding; however, a purely tectonic superposition of the two units cannot be ruled out.
