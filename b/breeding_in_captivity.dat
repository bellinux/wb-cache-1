5|$|Breeding convicts is {{as simple}} as having a male and a female in the same tank with {{adequate}} water quality and feeding. There is no special conditioning required. Due to their prolific <b>breeding</b> <b>in</b> <b>captivity,</b> there is a very low demand for Convict fry, and one may easily find their aquarium overstocked with an inbreeding population of Convicts without any avenues for adoption.|$|E
5|$|The black morph is {{less common}} than the spotted form but, at about {{six percent of}} the population, it is several orders of {{magnitude}} above the mutation rate. Hence, it is being supported by selection. Some evidence indicates the melanism allele is dominant. The black form may {{be an example of}} heterozygote advantage; <b>breeding</b> <b>in</b> <b>captivity</b> is not yet conclusive on this. Melanistic jaguars (or “black” jaguars) occur primarily in parts of South America, and are virtually unknown in wild populations residing in the subtropical and temperate regions of North America; they have never been documented north of Mexico’s Isthmus of Tehuantepec.|$|E

25|$|The {{offspring}} of a zebra-donkey cross {{is called a}} zonkey, zebroid, zebrass, or zedonk; zebra mule is an older term, but still used in some regions today. The foregoing terms generally refer to hybrids produced by breeding a male zebra to a female donkey. Zebra hinny, zebret and zebrinny all refer to the cross of a female zebra with a male donkey. Zebrinnies are rarer than zedonkies because female zebras in captivity are most valuable when used to produce full-blooded zebras. There are not enough female zebras <b>breeding</b> <b>in</b> <b>captivity</b> to spare them for hybridizing; {{there is no such}} limitation on the number of female donkeys breeding.|$|E
2500|$|Cheetah <b>breeding</b> <b>in</b> <b>captivity</b> is difficult, as {{males and}} females live {{separately}} in the wild and females are picky in choosing a partner.

6000|$|From {{these facts}} it {{can hardly be}} doubted that C. livia, affinis, intermedia, and the forms marked with an {{interrogation}} by Bonaparte ought all to be included under a single species. But it is quite immaterial {{whether or not they}} are thus ranked, and whether some one of these forms or all are the progenitors of the various domestic kinds, as far as any light can thus be thrown on the differences between the more strongly-marked races. That common dovecote-pigeons, which are kept in various parts of the world, are descended from one or from several of the above-mentioned wild varieties of C. livia, no one who compares them will doubt. But before making a few remarks on dovecote-pigeons, it should be stated that the wild rock-pigeon has been found easy to tame in several countries. We have seen that Colonel King at Hythe stocked his dovecote more than twenty years ago with young wild birds taken at the Orkney Islands, and since then they have greatly multiplied. The accurate Macgillivray (6/15. 'History of British Birds' volume 1 pages 275-284. Mr. Andrew Duncan tamed a rock-pigeon in the Shetland Islands. Mr. James Barclay, and Mr. Smith of Uyea Sound, both say that the wild rock-pigeon can be easily tamed; and the former gentleman asserts that the tamed birds breed four times a year. Dr. Lawrence Edmondstone informs me that a wild rock-pigeon came and settled in his dovecote in Balta Sound in the Shetland Islands, and bred with his pigeons; he has also given me other instances of the wild rock-pigeon having been taken young and <b>breeding</b> <b>in</b> <b>captivity.)</b> asserts that he completely tamed a wild rock-pigeon in the Hebrides; and several accounts are on records of these pigeons having bred in dovecotes in the Shetland Islands. In India, as Captain Hutton informs me, the wild rock-pigeon is easily tamed, and breeds readily with the domestic kind; and Mr. Blyth (6/16. 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. History' volume 19 1847 page 103 and volume for 1857 page 512.) asserts that wild birds come frequently to the dovecotes and mingle freely with their inhabitants. In the ancient 'Ayeen Akbery' it is written that, if a few wild pigeons be taken, [...] "they are speedily joined by a thousand others of their kind." ...|$|E
6000|$|Birds {{offer in}} some respects better {{evidence}} than quadrupeds, from their breeding more rapidly and being kept in greater numbers. (18/29. A list of the species of birds which have bred in the Zoological Gardens from 1848 to 1867 inclusive has been published by Mr. Sclater in 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1869 page 626, since {{the first edition of}} this work appeared. Of Columbae 51 species have been kept, and of Anseres 80 species, and in both these families 1 species in 2.6 have bred at least once in the 20 years. Of Gallinae 83 species have been kept and 1 in 27 have bred; of 57 Grallae 1 in 9 have bred; of 110 Prehensores 1 in 22 have bred; of 178 Passeres 1 in 25.4 have bred; of 94 Accipitres 1 in 47 have bred; of 25 Picariae and of 35 Herodiones not one species in either group has bred.) We have seen that carnivorous animals are more fertile under confinement than most other mammals. The reverse holds good with carnivorous birds. It is said (18/30. 'Encyclop. of Rural Sports' page 691.) that as many as eighteen species have been used in Europe for hawking, and several others in Persia and India (18/31. According to Sir A. Burnes 'Cabool' etc. page 51, eight species are used for hawking in Sinde.); they have been kept in their native country in the finest condition, and have been flown during six, eight, or nine years (18/32. Loudon's 'Mag. of Nat. Hist.' volume 6 1833 page 110.); yet there is no record of their having ever produced young. As these birds were formerly caught whilst young, at great expense, being imported from Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, {{there can be little doubt}} that, if possible, they would have been propagated. In the Jardin des Plantes, no bird of prey has been known to couple. (18/33. F. Cuvier 'Annal. du Museum' tome 9 page 128.) No hawk, vulture, or owl has ever produced fertile eggs in the Zoological Gardens, or in the old Surrey Gardens, with the exception, in the former place on one occasion, of a condor and a kite (Milvus niger). Yet several species, namely, the Aquila fusca, Haliaetus leucocephalus, Falco tinnunculus, F. subbuteo, and Buteo vulgaris, have been seen to couple in the Zoological Gardens. Mr. Morris (18/34. 'The Zoologist' volume 7-8 1849-50 page 2648.) mentions as a unique fact that a kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) bred in an aviary. The one kind of owl which has been known to couple in the Zoological Gardens was the Eagle Owl (Bubo maximus); and this species shows a special inclination to breed in captivity; for a pair at Arundel Castle, kept more nearly in a state of nature [...] "than ever fell to the lot of an animal deprived of its liberty" [...] (18/35. Knox 'Ornithological Rambles in Sussex' page 91.), actually reared their young. Mr. Gurney has given another instance of this same owl breeding in confinement; and he records the case of a second species of owl, the Strix passerina, <b>breeding</b> <b>in</b> <b>captivity.</b> (18/36. 'The Zoologist' volume 7-8 1849-50 page 2566; volume 9-10 1851-2 page 3207.) ...|$|E
