5|$|Throughout Western Pennsylvania counties, protesters used {{violence}} and intimidation to prevent federal officials from collecting the tax. Resistance {{came to a}} climax in July 1794, when a U.S. marshal arrived in western Pennsylvania to serve writs to distillers who had not paid the excise. The alarm was raised, and more than 500 armed men attacked the fortified home of tax inspector General John Neville. Washington responded by sending peace commissioners to western Pennsylvania {{to negotiate with the}} rebels, {{while at the same time}} calling on governors to send a militia force to enforce the tax. Washington himself rode at the head of an army to suppress the insurgency, with 13,000 militiamen provided by the governors of Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The rebels all went home before the arrival of the army, and there was no confrontation. About 20 men were arrested, but all were later acquitted or pardoned. Most distillers in nearby Kentucky were found to be all <b>but</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> tax—in the next six years, over 175 distillers from Kentucky were convicted of violating the tax law. Numerous examples of resistance are recorded in court documents and newspaper accounts.|$|E

The Saxons saved only 23 of their {{artillery}} pieces, while losing 59. The Prussians lost at least 24 guns plus 12 colors. Davout estimated his losses as 7,000 at Auerstedt while his enemies suffered 10,000 killed and wounded and 3,000 captured. The Prussians admitted losing 57 guns from their artillery batteries, not counting regimental guns. So Davout's {{claim to have}} captured 115 pieces may be accurate.|$|E
25|$|Scott had longed {{opposed the}} {{prohibition}} of alcohol, but the war made it all <b>but</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> resist the pressure of temperance advocates. In a March 1915 speech in Oxbow, Scott announced that all drinking establishments in Saskatchewan would be closed as of July 1, {{to be replaced by}} provincially run liquor stores. This move would prove inadequate in the following months, as both Alberta and Manitoba enacted Prohibition. Sensing the sign of the times, Scott held a provincial referendum on the topic – the first time women had been allowed to vote in Saskatchewan – and in December 1916, 80% of Saskatchewan voters voted to ban alcohol in the province.|$|E
25|$|The {{modulation}} of {{the radio}} emissions by planetary rotation is traditionally {{used to determine the}} rotation period of the interiors of fluid giant planets. In the case of Saturn, however, this appears to be impossible, as the period varies at the timescale of tens years. In 1980–1981 the periodicity in the radio emissions as measured by Voyager 1 and 2 was , which was then adopted as the rotational period of Saturn. Scientists were surprised when Galileo and then Cassini returned a different value—. Further observation indicated that the modulation period changes by as much as 1% on the characteristic timescale of 20–30days with an additional long term trend. There is a correlation between the period and solar wind speed, however, the causes of this change remain a mystery. One reason may be that the saturnian perfectly axially symmetric magnetic field fails to impose a strict corotation on the magnetospheric plasma making it slip relative to the planet. The lack of a precise correlation between the variation period of SKR and planetary rotation makes it all <b>but</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> determine the true rotational period of Saturn.|$|E

500|$|Jim Sterling of The Escapist {{wrote that}} Zero's portrayal, {{especially}} her sexual empowerment {{and the fact}} that she had dominance over the male characters, was [...] "refreshing". Capsule Computers' Travis Bruno commented that Zero is [...] "largely the villain of the series", but that he felt the need to see her journey through to its end. Ron Duwell of Techno Buffalo, while commenting on the quality of the design of the characters, claimed that Zero was [...] "the best looking of the bunch with her acrobatic kicks and sword slashes being pulled off without a hitch." [...] Geoff Thew of Hardcore Gamer complimented the character, calling her actions, attitudes and language [...] "a nicely self-contained example of how [...] plays with juxtaposition." [...] Mike Splechta of GameZone agreed, stating [...] "the character designs were fantastic. I loved Zero's look in particular; her white flowy dress only serves as a contrast to her violent behavior since it gets drenched in blood the more you tear enemies apart with her weapons." [...] RPGFans Derek Heemsbergen referred to Zero as [...] "foul-mouthed butcher", although he was generally positive about her story and her interactions with Mikhail and the disciples, calling the latter [...] "strange and often hilarious". Andrew Barker, in an analysis of the game for RPGFan, referred to her as [...] "violence personified", noting how the game gradually justified her actions. She was also noted, alongside One, as being the only Intoner who had no real need for a disciple. In a final note, he said that he only felt comfortable with Zero during the game's fourth branch, where her motives were revealed. Anime News Network's Todd Ciolek described her as a conscious mockery of standard action-game protagonists, referring to her as [...] "murderous, foul-mouthed, impulsive, abusive, and all <b>but</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> like." ...|$|E

2500|$|Between 1925 and 1927, Mussolini {{progressively}} dismantled {{virtually all}} constitutional and conventional restraints on {{his power and}} built a police state.

2500|$|With the {{building}} of the Long Walls, Athens essentially became an island within the mainland, in that no strictly land based force could hope to capture it. [...] (In ancient Greek warfare, it was all <b>but</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> take a walled city by any means other than starvation and surrender.) [...] Thus, Athens could rely on her powerful fleet to keep her safe in any conflict with other cities on the Greek mainland. [...] The walls were completed {{in the aftermath of the}} Athenian defeat at Tanagra, in which a Spartan army defeated the Athenians in the field but was unable to take the city because of the presence of the city walls; seeking to secure their city even against siege, the Athenians completed the long walls; and, hoping to prevent all invasions of Attica, they also seized Boeotia, which, as they already controlled Megara, put all approaches to Attica in friendly hands. [...] For most of the First Peloponnesian War, Athens was indeed unassailable by land, but the loss of Megara and Boeotia at the end of that war forced the Athenians to turn back to the long walls as their source of defense.|$|E
