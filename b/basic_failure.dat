In this paper we study the behaviour of four representative matching algorithms under varying signal-to-noise ratio in six types of error statistics.

A ground truth experiment shows that the best choice for view prediction is the Graph Cuts algorithm and for structure reconstruction it is the Confidently Stable Matching. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn a man-machine system, {{equipment}} reliability and human reliability {{are affected by}} many {{factors such as the}} environment in which equipment is operated and psychological stress imposed on a human operator. In the probabilistic method of reliability analysis the <b>basic</b> <b>failure</b> rate and the basic error rate are modified by experts to consider the influence of these factors on reliability. However, these influences are not easily expressed quantitatively, because the relation between {{equipment reliability}} or human reliability and each of these factors is not clear. In this paper the relation is expressed qualitatively. Furthermore, equipment reliability and human reliability are represented by failure possibility and error possibility, respectively, which are fuzzy sets on the interval [0, 1]. A method is presented to derive failure possibility and error possibility from subjective estimates of not only the <b>basic</b> <b>failure</b> rate or the basic error rate but also each factor that affects reliability. Fuzzy reasoning is used in this method. An example is given of reliability analysis of a man-machine system using failure possibility and error possibility obtained by this method...|$|E

40|$|In {{terms of}} risk, many appraisals of very large {{infrastructure}} investments assume, or pretend to assume, that infrastructure policies and projects {{exist in a}} predictable Newtonian world {{of cause and effect}} where things go according to plan. In reality, the world of policy and project preparation and implementation is a highly stochastic one where things happen only with a certain probability and rarely turn out as originally intended. The failure to reflect the probabilistic reality of investment preparation and implementation is a central reason for the poor track record that can be documented for many major projects. The article describes lessons and recommendations on how to improve accountability in decision making on very large infrastructure investments in Denmark and Germany. The conventional approach to infrastructure investments is replaced by an alternative focusing on accountability. Redrawing the borderlines of private and public involvement, four specific measures to increase accountability are suggested and detailed: (1) Transparency, (2) Performance specifications, (3) Explication of regulatory regimes, and (4) Involvement of risk capital. The decision on whether or not to build a multi-billion dollar fixed link across the Baltic Sea connecting Scandinavia and Germany is used as an illustrative case. The cyclical process about the promotion of the German MAGLEV technology gives another good example for identifying <b>basic</b> <b>failures</b> in the political process. Beyond these examples from two countries, the approach developed is likely to be relevant for other major projects in other countries as well. ...|$|R
