5|$|In Darwin's global hypothesis, vast {{areas where}} the seabed was being {{elevated}} were marked by fringing reefs, sometimes around active volcanoes, and similarly huge {{areas where the}} ocean floor was subsiding were indicated by barrier reefs or atolls based on inactive volcanoes. These views received general support from deep sea drilling results in the 1980s. His idea that rising land would be <b>balanced</b> <b>by</b> subsidence in ocean areas has been superseded by modern plate tectonics, {{which he did not}} anticipate.|$|E
5|$|In many people, the {{infection}} waxes and wanes. Tissue destruction and necrosis are often <b>balanced</b> <b>by</b> healing and fibrosis. Affected tissue {{is replaced by}} scarring and cavities filled with caseous necrotic material. During active disease, some of these cavities are joined to the air passages bronchi and this material can be coughed up. It contains living bacteria, so can spread {{the infection}}. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics kills bacteria and allows healing to take place. Upon cure, affected areas are eventually replaced by scar tissue.|$|E
5|$|The walled {{garden to}} the {{north-east}} {{was built in}} 1708 by Alexander McGill, to designs by the Earl of Mar, who also designed the gate piers and garden buildings, and supplied statuary. The garden may have been <b>balanced</b> <b>by</b> a similar walled garden to the south-east of the house. No trace is now visible, but a second garden is shown on 18th century maps of the area, {{and would have been}} consistent with Bruce's symmetrical layout.|$|E

5|$|Voorhis had the {{advantage}} of incumbency, but this was <b>balanced</b> <b>by</b> other factors favoring Nixon. Due to the press of Congressional business, Voorhis was able to devote only two months to the campaign, while Nixon campaigned in the district for ten months. Voorhis's time was further limited when, while en route to California from Washington D.C. in August, he was forced to have surgery for hemorrhoids in Ogden, Utah. He spent two weeks in an Ogden hotel recuperating from the operation.|$|E
5|$|When Andrew Demetriou {{left the}} AFLPA {{to join the}} AFL, Dr Robert Kerr became AFLPA CEO, taking up the {{position}} in June 2000. Previously, Rob had been the AFLPA's Executive Director (Player Development). A significant focus for the AFLPA at this time was to implement the player support programs and ensure that the shift to full-time professionalism was <b>balanced</b> <b>by</b> efforts to prepare players for life after football.|$|E
5|$|A {{special case}} of natural {{selection}} is sexual selection, which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates. Traits that evolved through sexual selection are particularly prominent among males of several animal species. Although sexually favoured, traits such as cumbersome antlers, mating calls, large body size and bright colours often attract predation, which compromises the survival of individual males. This survival disadvantage is <b>balanced</b> <b>by</b> higher reproductive success in males that show these hard-to-fake, sexually selected traits.|$|E

5|$|Appropriate {{antibiotics}} {{decrease the}} average 3–5 day duration of symptoms by about one day, and also reduce contagiousness. They are primarily prescribed to reduce rare complications such as rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess. The arguments {{in favor of}} antibiotic treatment should be <b>balanced</b> <b>by</b> the consideration of possible side effects, and it is reasonable to suggest that no antimicrobial treatment be given to healthy adults who have adverse reactions to medication or those at low risk of complications. Antibiotics are prescribed for strep throat at a higher rate than would be expected from how common it is.|$|E
5|$|As English cathedrals {{are often}} {{surrounded}} by an expanse of green lawn, the plan is usually clearly visible at ground level, {{which is not the}} case with the many European cathedrals that are closely surrounded by town or monastic buildings. The general impression is that the English cathedral sprawls across its site with many projecting limbs. These horizontal projections are visibly <b>balanced</b> <b>by</b> the strong verticals of the massive towers, which may be one, two or three in number. Many of the cathedrals, particularly those like Winchester, St. Albans and Peterborough where the towers are not particularly high, give an impression of tremendous length and have been described as resembling “aircraft carriers”.|$|E
5|$|Boron {{is found}} in nature on Earth entirely as various oxides of B(III), often {{associated}} with other elements. More than one hundred borate minerals contain boron in oxidation state +3. These minerals resemble silicates in some respect, although boron is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, the boron minerals never contain boron with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral borax, shown at left. The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate center is <b>balanced</b> <b>by</b> metal cations in the minerals, such as the sodium (Na+) in borax.|$|E

5|$|In general, Megalosaurus had {{the typical}} build {{of a large}} theropod. It was bipedal, the {{horizontal}} torso being <b>balanced</b> <b>by</b> a long horizontal tail. The hindlimbs were long and strong with three forward-facing weight-bearing toes, the forelimbs relatively short but exceptionally robust and probably carrying three digits. Being a carnivore, its large elongated head bore long dagger-like teeth to slice the flesh of its prey. The skeleton of Megalosaurus is highly ossified, indicating a robust and muscular animal, though the lower leg was not as heavily built as that of Torvosaurus, a close relative.|$|E
5|$|It {{evolved from}} the upper house of the colonial {{assembly}} created in 1650 when Maryland was a proprietary colony controlled by Cecilius Calvert. It consisted of the Governor {{and members of the}} Governor's appointed council. With slight variation, the body to meet in that form until 1776, when Maryland, now a state independent of British rule, passed a new constitution that created an electoral college to appoint members of the Senate. This electoral college was abolished in 1838 and members began to be directly elected from each county and Baltimore City. In 1972, because of a Supreme Court decision, the number of districts was increased to 47, and the districts were <b>balanced</b> <b>by</b> population rather than being geographically determined.|$|E
5|$|Laminar {{boundary}} layers can be loosely classified {{according to}} their structure and {{the circumstances under which}} they are created. The thin shear layer which develops on an oscillating body {{is an example of a}} Stokes boundary layer, while the Blasius boundary layer refers to the well-known similarity solution near an attached flat plate held in an oncoming unidirectional flow and Falkner–Skan boundary layer, a generalization of Blasius profile. When a fluid rotates and viscous forces are <b>balanced</b> <b>by</b> the Coriolis effect (rather than convective inertia), an Ekman layer forms. In the theory of heat transfer, a thermal boundary layer occurs. A surface can have multiple types of boundary layer simultaneously.|$|E

5|$|Legumes such as clover or alfalfa {{are usually}} higher in protein, calcium, and energy than grasses. However, they require warm weather and good soil {{to produce the}} best nutrients. Legume hays are {{generally}} higher in protein than the grass hays. They are also higher in minerals, particularly calcium, but have an incorrect ratio of calcium to phosphorus. Because they are high in protein, they are very desirable for growing horses or those subjected to very hard work, but the calcium:phosphorus ratio must be <b>balanced</b> <b>by</b> other feeds to prevent bone abnormalities.|$|E
5|$|Lhermitte {{filed for}} and {{received}} a judgment of divorce before her trial; Moqadem at first appealed the decision but later withdrew his objection. Following the trial, Lhermitte {{was not able to}} pay for the trial costs, so under Belgian law it fell to her now ex-husband to pick up the bill. This conformed to the Law of Belgium, with the state seeking funds due to have been shared from the sale of their house under their divorce agreement. The overall court expenses and fines were 72,743 euros (about $93,000). Moqadem said he was “disgusted and revolted” by the injustice of this billing system. Moqadem’s attorney attempted to have the bill written off, calling for “administrative requirements to be <b>balanced</b> <b>by</b> decency” given the nature of the tragedy.|$|E
5|$|The first naturalists who {{investigated}} Megalosaurus mistook it for {{a gigantic}} lizard of twenty metres length. In 1842, Owen concluded {{that it was no}} longer than nine metres, standing on upright legs. He still thought it was a quadruped, though. Modern scientists, by comparing Megalosaurus with its direct relatives in the Megalosauridae, were able to obtain a more accurate picture. Megalosaurus was about seven metres long, weighing about 1.1 tonnes. It was bipedal, walking on stout hindlimbs, its horizontal torso <b>balanced</b> <b>by</b> a horizontal tail. Its forelimbs were short, though very robust. Megalosaurus had a rather large head, equipped with long curved teeth. It was generally a robust and heavily muscled animal.|$|E

5|$|The {{other main}} sources of {{information}} are maps, particularly those published {{at the time the}} canal was to be converted into a railway. These clearly show twin-track inclines at Capel Ifan and Pont Henry, and because most of the traffic was in the downhill direction, a simple counterbalanced system was probably employed, although it has also been suggested that the barge may have been <b>balanced</b> <b>by</b> a water tank on the second track to more easily control the speed of descent. The Hirwaunissa incline was longer and narrower than the other two, and only included a single track. Recent research has suggested that the incline was powered by a water wheel, with the waste water running down the incline in a side channel, in order to supply the lower levels of the canal.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's {{offense was}} {{slightly}} {{worse than the}} national average during the regular season. The Hokies were ranked No. 64 in total offense, averaging 374.09 yards per game. In particular, Tech's passing offense was lacking. That segment of the offense was ranked No. 86, averaging 179.36 yards. This figure was somewhat <b>balanced</b> <b>by</b> the Hokies' rushing attack, which was ranked No. 55 (194.73 ypg). Despite the worse-than-average yardage totals, Tech was ranked No. 25 in scoring offense, or 32.64 points per game. Prior to the Gator Bowl, it was announced that Virginia Tech offensive coordinator Rickey Bustle would be leaving the team to take the same position at the Louisiana-Lafayette. Despite the move, he confirmed he would coach the Hokies during the bowl game in his last act as a Virginia Tech coach.|$|E
