40|$|SH 2 domain {{proteins}} {{are important}} {{components of the}} signal transduction pathways activated by growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. We have been cloning SH 2 domain proteins by bacterial expression cloning using the tyrosine phosphorylated C-terminus of the epidermal growth factor receptor as a probe. One of these newly cloned SH 2 domain proteins, GRB- 7, was mapped on mouse chromosome 11 to a region which also contains the tyrosine kinase receptor, HER 2 /erbB- 2. The analogous chromosomal locus in man is often amplified in human breast cancer leading to overexpression of HER 2. We find that GRB- 7 is amplified in concert with HER 2 in several breast cancer cell lines and that GRB- 7 is overexpressed in both cell lines and breast tumors. GRB- 7, through its SH 2 domain, binds tightly to HER 2 such that a large fraction of the tyrosine phosphorylated HER 2 in SKBR- 3 cells is bound to GRB- 7. GRB- 7 can also bind tyrosine phosphorylated SHC, albeit at a lower affinity than GRB 2 binds SHC. We also find that GRB- 7 has a strong similarity over > 300 amino acids to a newly identified gene in Caenorhabditis elegans. This region of similarity, which lies outside the SH 2 domain, also contains a pleckstrin homology domain. The presence of evolutionarily conserved domains indicates that GRB- 7 is likely to perform a <b>basic</b> <b>signaling</b> function. The fact that GRB- 7 and HER 2 are both overexpressed and bound tightly together suggests that this <b>basic</b> <b>signaling</b> pathway is greatly amplified in certain breast cancers...|$|R
