60|$|The first {{picture is}} a full length of Aurelia Koslow, a German fraulein, or rather a {{half-breed}} between German and Russian. She is eighteen years of age, and has been sent to Brussels to finish her education; she is of middle size, stiffly made, body long, legs short, bust much developed but not compactly moulded, waist disproportionately compressed by an inhumanly braced corset, dress carefully arranged, large feet tortured into small bottines, head small, hair smoothed, braided, oiled, and gummed to perfection; very low forehead, very diminutive and vindictive grey eyes, somewhat Tartar features, rather flat nose, rather high-cheek bones, yet the ensemble not positively ugly; tolerably good complexion. So much for person. As to mind, deplorably ignorant and ill-informed: incapable of writing or speaking correctly even German, her native tongue, a dunce in French, and her attempts at learning English a mere farce, yet she has been at school twelve years; but as she invariably gets her exercises, of every description, done by a fellow pupil, and reads her lessons off a book; concealed in her lap, it is not wonderful that her progress has been so snail-like. I {{do not know what}} Aurelia's daily habits of life are, because I have not the opportunity of observing her at all times; but from what I see of the state of her desk, books, and papers, I should say she is slovenly and even dirty; her outward dress, as I have said, is well attended to, but in passing behind her bench, I have remarked that her neck is gray for want of washing, and her hair, so glossy with gum and grease, is not such as one feels tempted to pass the hand over, much less to run the fingers through. Aurelia's conduct in class, at least when I am present, is something extraordinary, considered as an index of girlish innocence. The moment I enter the room, she nudges her next neighbour and indulges in a half-suppressed laugh. As I take my seat on the estrade, she fixes her eye on me; she seems resolved to attract, and, if possible, monopolize my notice: to this end she launches at me all sorts of looks, languishing, provoking, leering, laughing. As I am found quite proof against this sort of artillery--for we scorn what, unasked, is lavishly offered--she has recourse to the expedient of making noises; sometimes she sighs, sometimes groans, sometimes utters inarticulate sounds, for which language has no name. If, in walking up the schoolroom, I pass near her, she puts out her foot that it may touch mine; if I do not happen to observe the manoeuvre, and my boot comes in contact with her <b>brodequin,</b> she affects to fall into convulsions of suppressed laughter; if I notice the snare and avoid it, she expresses her mortification in sullen muttering, where I hear myself abused in bad French, pronounced with an intolerable Low German accent.|$|E

50|$|Torture was {{a commonplace}} effort to extract confessions from accused witches during the seventeenth century, clearly {{recommended}} in the Malleus Maleficarum. Grandier {{was put to}} preliminary torture almost immediately after sentence was passed upon him. Most accused witches immediately confessed, telling their torturers exactly {{what they wanted to}} hear. Father Grandier never confessed, maintaining his innocence even under the most severe forms of torture. The method of torture used was the <b>Brodequins,</b> or Boot, which consisted of a total of sixteen to eighteen wedges driven between planks strongly bound to his legs, designed to slowly break the bones. He refused to name any accomplices, which drove Father Tranquille to break both Grandier's legs.|$|R
60|$|It {{is not to}} be supposed, {{considering}} the vast interest which the arrival of the family at Clavering Park inspired in the inhabitants of the little town, that Madame Fribsby alone, of all the folks in Clavering, should have remained unmoved and incurious. At the first appearance of the Park family in church, Madame noted every article of toilette which the ladies wore, from their bonnets to their <b>brodequins,</b> and took a survey of the attire of the ladies' maids in the pew allotted to them. We fear that Doctor Portman's sermon, though it was one of his oldest and most valued compositions, had little effect upon Madame Fribsby on that day.|$|R

50|$|The name <b>Brodequin</b> {{was chosen}} by Jamie Bailey, after the medieval torture device. Torture devices in general are {{referred}} to frequently in the group's lyrical content. While lyrics describing dismemberment, torture, murder, and abuse are unsurprising in death metal, <b>Brodequin</b> is unusual in exploring such phenomena within a historical context. Jamie Bailey is a history graduate {{and most of his}} lyrics are inspired by real historical events.|$|E

6000|$|Again I {{stood at}} the {{neighbouring}} door, and soon was re-admitted into the cheerful passage with its clear dove-colour imitation marble walls. I followed the portress, and descending a step, and making a turn, I found myself {{in a sort of}} corridor; a side-door opened, Mdlle. Reuter's little figure, as graceful as it was plump, appeared. I could now see her dress in full daylight; a neat, simple mousseline-laine gown fitted her compact round shape to perfection--delicate little collar and manchettes of lace, trim Parisian <b>brodequins</b> showed her neck, wrists, and feet, to complete advantage; but how grave was her face as she came suddenly upon me! Solicitude and business were in her eye--on her forehead; she looked almost stern. Her [...] "Bon jour, monsieur," [...] was quite polite, but so orderly, so commonplace, it spread directly a cool, damp towel over my [...] "vives impressions." [...] The servant turned back when her mistress appeared, and I walked slowly along the corridor, side by side with Mdlle. Reuter.|$|R
5000|$|White {{and brown}} low laced leather shoes were {{prescribed}} to wear {{with either the}} earlier ANL khaki service/work uniform or the white summer dress for all-ranks and, after 1964 black ones were required for RLAF officers wearing the new blue-grey officers' dress uniform on formal occasions.Laotian Aviation personnel in the field initially wore a mixture of American and French regulation footwear, including brown leather US M-1943 Combat Service Boots, French M1917 brown leather hobnailed boots (French: <b>Brodequins</b> modéle 1917), and French canvas-and-rubber Pataugas tropical boots, replaced by sandals while in garrison. Black leather combat boots began to be provided to the RLAF in the 1960s by the Americans, who issued both the early US Army M-1962 [...] "McNamara" [...] model and the M-1967 model with [...] "ripple" [...] pattern rubbler sole. A few Laotian pilots and senior officers managed to acquire the US Army Jungle boot, a highly prized item not issued to the RLAF whilst local copies of the South Vietnamese Bata tropical boot were worn by some ground personnel.|$|R
60|$|It must be {{admitted}} that appearances did not wholly discountenance this idea; Madame seemed so bent on retaining his services, so oblivious {{of her former}} protégé, Pillule. She made, too, such a point of personally receiving his visits, and was so unfailingly cheerful, blithe, and benignant in her manner to him. Moreover, she paid, about this time, marked attention to dress: the morning dishabille, the nightcap and shawl, were discarded; Dr. John's early visits always found her with auburn braids all nicely arranged, silk dress trimly fitted on, neat laced <b>brodequins</b> in lieu of slippers: in short the whole toilette complete as a model, and fresh as a flower. I scarcely think, however, that her intention in this went further than just to show a very handsome man {{that she was not}} quite a plain woman; and plain she was not. Without beauty of feature or elegance of form, she pleased. Without youth and its gay graces, she cheered. One never tired of seeing her: she was never monotonous, or insipid, or colourless, or flat. Her unfaded hair, her eye with its temperate blue light, her cheek with its wholesome fruit-like bloom--these things pleased in moderation, but with constancy.|$|R
5000|$|A buskin is a knee- or calf-length boot made {{of leather}} or cloth which laces closed, but is open across the toes. It was worn by Athenian tragic actors, hunters and {{soldiers}} in Ancient Greek, Etruscan, and Roman societies. The word buskin, only recorded in English since 1503 meaning [...] "half boot", is of unknown origin, perhaps from Old French brousequin (in modern French <b>brodequin)</b> or directly from its Middle Dutch model brosekin [...] "small leather boot". Figurative senses relating to tragedy {{are from the}} word being used (since 1570) to translate Greek kothornos or Latin cothurnos, the high, thick-soled boot worn in Athenian tragedy; contrasted with sock (from Latin soccus), the low shoe worn by comedians.|$|E
5000|$|Josephine Mary Premice {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York, the {{daughter}} of Thelomaine and Lucas Premice. Her parents {{were part of the}} Haitian aristocracy who fled Haiti after her father, Lucas Premice, who allegedly had claim to the title Count de <b>Brodequin,</b> was part of a failed rebellion to try to overthrow the dictator of the country. Lucas was imprisoned in Guiana. He and a fellow prisoner to whom he was chained escaped and fled through the woods to friends that awaited them on the coast. On the third day of their journey, the other man died, and Lucas is said to have had to cut off the man's arm to free himself from the chains. He was brought to France, where he learned to cut fur for the couturiers. He eventually immigrated to New York in the early 1920s.|$|E

Local copies of the South Vietnamese Bata tropical boots were also worn in the south.|$|R
