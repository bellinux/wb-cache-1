40|$|Hoeing {{can improve}} weed control in cereals but this {{requires}} wider row spacing of the crop. A spe-cific band row design may also ensure high crop yield and quality, {{especially at the}} conditions of organic farming. In order to study those effects two field experiments with winter wheat were con-ducted in 2005 and 2006 at the organic farming research area of the BBA. Three different row de-signs have been investigated: narrow (100 mm spacing), wide (400 mm) and <b>band</b> <b>sowing</b> (alternat-ing of crop band of 400 mm and a crop-free band of 300 mm width). All plots were harrowed whereas the wide and band sown plots have additionally been hoed. Also two cultivars differing in growth habit and competitiveness were tested (Ludwig, Pegassos). Neither harrowing nor the combination of harrowing and hoeing could reduce weed density (by analysing data before and after treatments). Also the different row spacing {{had no effect on}} weed density at late spring (257 weeds m- 2). However, weed growth at the same time was clearly influ-enced by the row spacing: Weed biomass was significantly higher in the plots with wide rows (23. 1 g m- 2) compared to normal (8. 3 g m- 2) and <b>band</b> <b>sowing</b> (10. 5 g m- 2). Crop yield was highest at <b>band</b> <b>sowing</b> (7. 09 t ha- 1) whereas the wide sown crop stand was of significant lower yield (6. 18 t ha- 1) but highest protein content (10 %). Regarding cultivar effects Pegassos was more competitive against weeds and provided also a higher yield than cultivar Ludwig. So far, <b>band</b> <b>sowing</b> has been proved as an easily applicable sowing technique which enables the use of hoes in cereals and ensure high crop yield especially at conditions of organic farming...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{establish}} the “state of the art” for inter-row hoeing and its associated agronomic practices in organic cereal and pulse crops. To achieve this a detailed review of literature was undertaken. •	To facilitate inter-row cultivation in cereal and pulse crops, some adjustment of row spacing may be required. For cereals, drilling crops in 25 cm rows can reduce yield compared with normal drilling practice, primarily due to greater intra-specific competition amongst the crop (i. e. competition between crop plants). •	The yield penalty resulting from widely spaced crop rows can be minimised using a number of approaches, depending on the drill: 1. 	Reducing the seed rate in widely spaced crop rows can help to minimise excessive intra-specific competition. 2. 	<b>Band</b> <b>sowing</b> the crop in wide rows can also help to minimise intra-specific competition as the seed is distributed over a greater area. 3. 	Using a twin-row arrangement can completely overcome the yield penalty. •	The recommended row spacing for peas (up to 20 cm) and beans (up to 35 cm) does not require any further adjustment for inter-row hoeing. •	Recent developments in automated guidance of inter-row hoeing equipment mean that weeding operations can now be conducted a much higher speeds (10 km h- 1). This has highlighted the limitations {{of some of the}} cultivators currently used (e. g. ‘A’ blades), as excessive soil throw can occur at this high speed. Rolling cultivators may prove to be the most suitable at high forward speeds. For manually guided hoes working at slower speeds (5 km h- 1), ‘A’ and ‘L’ blades offer an effective low cost solution. •	In terms of the timing of inter-row hoeing, it is suggested that weeding operations should be conducted at an early stage in the growing season, as the weeds that emerge with or shortly after the crop are the ones that pose the most significant threat for crop yield. Weeding on two occasions can provide better levels of weed control than weeding once, but weeding more frequently offered little additional benefit. Reductions of weed biomass of up to 99...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate split nitrogen (N) fertilization of maize applied in <b>band</b> at <b>sowing</b> and top dressing with and without crop rotation, under no-till. The experiment was conducted with six N rates at sowing (0, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 kg ha- 1) combined with three rates in top dressing (40, 70, 100 kg ha- 1) and two management systems: after five cropping sequences of maize and crop rotation (maize + soybean + oat + soybean + corn) in a randomized block design with four replications. The crop rotation system increased yield in approximately 7 % in relation to the area without rotation. The split of nitrogen fertilization, in rates above 39 and 54 kg ha- 1 at sowing and 70 and 40 kg ha- 1 in top dressing, resulted in yield higher than that obtained with the application of 100 kg ha- 1 in top dressing. Grain yield was higher with the rates 50 and 70 kg ha- 1 of N compared with that obtained with 20 and 100 kg ha- 1 at sowing and top dressing, respectively.

40|$|Steaming {{of narrow}} soil <b>bands</b> prior to <b>sowing</b> {{is a new}} {{technique}} that reduces the need for intra-row weeding in herbicide-free row crops. However, the steam treatment may eliminate both weed seeds and non-target soil organisms, thereby affecting the nutrient cycling in the soil. This study tested the effect of band-steaming on N and C dynamics in a sandy loam soil that was steamed in situ to maximal temperatures of 70 – 90 °C using a prototype bandsteamer. Soil samples (0 – 5 cm depth) were collected during 90 days from band-steamed soil, undisturbed control soil, and control soil treated just mechanically with the bandsteamer. In the steamed soil, ammonium concentrations increased from 1. 1 to 20. 3 μg NH 4 +-N g− 1 dry weight during 28 days.

40|$|Cereal–legume {{intercropping}} offers {{potential benefits}} in low-input cropping systems, where nutrient inputs, in particular nitrogen (N), are limited. In the present study, winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) were intercropped by sowing the wheat into rototilled strips in an established stand of white clover. A field experiment {{was performed in}} two fields starting in two different years to explore the effects of width of thewheat rows and clover strips on the competition between the species and on wheat yields. The factors were intercropping (clover sole crop, wheat sole crop and wheat/clover intercropping), rototilled <b>band</b> width, <b>sowing</b> width and wheat density in a factorial experimental design that enabled some of the interactions between the factors to be estimated. The measurements included grain yield, ear density, grain weight, grain N concentration, dry matter and N in above-ground biomass of wheat, clover and weeds and profiles of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) within the crop canopy. Intercropping of winter wheat and clover resulted in wheat grain yield decreases of 10 – 25 % compared with awheat sole crop. The yield reductions were likely caused by interspecific competition for light and N during vegetative growth, and for soil water during grain filling. N uptake in the wheat intercrop increased during late season growth, resulting in only small differences in total N uptake between wheat intercrops and sole crops, but increased grain N concentrations in the intercrop. Interspecific competition during vegetative wheat growth was reduced by increasing width of the rototilled strips from 7 to 14 cm, resulting i...|$|R
5000|$|In 1982 the 18-year-old {{poet and}} {{musician}} Yegor Letov formed the <b>band</b> Posev (The <b>Sowing,</b> {{named after the}} official NTS magazine) with his friend Konstantin [...] "Kuzya UO" [...] Ryabinov. In 1984 Posev became Grazhdanskaya Oborona. The band was preparing to record an album, but their defiantly anti-authoritarian stance and overtly political lyrics made them {{an easy target for}} the KGB. [...] "The mother of our guitarist Babenko, she was a sort of a party official, she listened to our records and went to the KGB and said, [...] "Comrades, my son is involved in an anti-Soviet organization", Letov recalled. In autumn 1985 Letov was committed to a mental ward, and Ryabinov was forcibly drafted into the army despite having a heart condition. Letov was released from the mental ward in March 1986 and immediately began to write and record music. He often recorded on his own, and while he credited other musicians, his collaborators went under pseudonyms as Letov remained on the outs with the Soviet system and, as he stated in an interview, the original members of GrOb were forced to sign sworn statements saying that they would stay away from Letov. In 1986-87 he recorded several cassette albums, playing all instruments himself, and released them through magnitizdat under the name of Grazhdanskaya Oborona. It was lo-fi, straightforward garage punk rock/post-punk with slight reggae influences and weird, irrational lyrics, inspired by Russian Futurist poetry.|$|R
40|$|In Brazil, Bradyrhizobium {{inoculation}} {{has successfully}} replaced {{the use of}} N fertilizer on soybean [Glycine max (L) Merr. ] crops. However, with the expansion of no-tillage cropping systems in the Cerrados region, {{the idea that it}} is necessary to use small N rates at the sowing to overcome problems related with N immobilization has become widespread, mainly when soybean is cultivated after a non-legume crop. In this study we examined soybean response to small rates of N fertilizer under no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) systems. Four experiments (a completely randomized block with five replicates) were carried out in a red yellow oxisol, during the periods of 1998 / 1999 and 1999 / 2000, under NT and CT. The treatments consisted of four urea rates (0, 20, 30 and 40 kg ha- 1 N). All treatments were inoculated with Bradyrhizobium japonicum strains SEMIA 5080 and SEMIA 5079, in the proportion 1 kg of peat inoculant (1, 5 x 10 (9) cells g- 1) per 50 kg of seeds. In both experiments, soybean was cultivated after corn and the N fertilizer was <b>band</b> applied at <b>sowing.</b> In all experiments, N rates promoted reductions of up to 50 % in the nodule number at 15 days after the emergence. Regardless of the management system, these reductions disappeared at the flowering stage and there was no effect of N rates on either the number and dry weight of nodules or on soybean yields. Therefore, in the Brazilian Cerrados, when an efficient symbiosis is established, it is not necessary to apply starter N rates on soybean, even when cultivated under notillage systems...|$|R
