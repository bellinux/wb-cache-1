40|$|The {{presence}} of copper nanoparticles in alumina and silica modifies their luminescence, {{and the changes}} in spectra are influenced by variations in the nanoparticle size distributions. Luminescence signals {{are sensitive to the}} total defect population. Thus the luminescence not only reflects changes caused by thermal annealing, which can modify both intrinsic defects and the copper nanoparticles, but also responds to the method of preparation of thin film layers. Copper nanoparticle influence on luminescence is reported both for ion-implanted bulk silica and for copper in pulsed laser deposition within alumina.

To consider all unsteady flow phenomena within a turbine the computation of the full annulus is required causing consid-erable computational cost.

This contribu-tion presents three different unsteady approaches to compare the accuracy and the computational effort, using a full annulus un-steady CFD simulation as a reference. The first approach mod-ifies the blade-to-blade ratio whereas the second method scales the circumferential flow pattern to reach spatial and temporal periodicity.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the process optimization in injection molding of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Both conventional injection molding and shear controlled orientation (SCORIM) {{were employed in}} processing. The process optimization was based on design of experiments and complemented with analysis of variance. Mechanical characterization {{was carried out by}} tensile testing. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry were used for the structural characterization of the moldings. High-density polyethylene exhibits 7. 2 GPa Young's modulus and 155 MPa of ultimate tensile strength following the application of SCORIM processing. These results account for a fourfold increase in Young's modulus and a fivefold increase in ultimate tensile strength compared to conventional injection molding. The maintenance of toughness while enhancing stiffness and strength of the SCORIM moldings is attributable to an oriented morphology developed during shear flow, i. e., shish-kebab structure. The frequency of shearing action has the strongest influence on the morphology development. It is also demonstrated that the studied parameters are very much interdependent. It is possible to achieve substantial gains in mechanical properties of HDPE in SCORIM processing without causing a substantial increase in cycle time. <b>Brite</b> <b>Euram</b> Programme DECRYP...|$|R

The studies have enabled optimised design of interrogators for sensing oxygen using a fluorescent polymer encapsulated ruthenium complex. Two basic interrogation methods were explored, using blue LED excitation. The Rapid Lifetime Detection (RLD) scheme, a fluorescence interrogation method based on direct interrogation of the decay curve following pulsed excitation was generalised, and a novel method for optimising measurement precision derived. The effect of background {{light on the}} optimum was quantified. Dissolved (aqueous) oxygen concentration was measured to a precision of 1 part per billion using a 1 second response time (the peak fluorescence power was only 12. 5 ± 0. 5 pW). A second interrogation method, where the phase delay between an intensity modulated excitation source and the resultant fluorescence is processed to make measurements, was for the first time, fully analysed for measurement of exponential decays. When measuring fluorescence lifetimes in the range 2. 9 - 3. 3 µs, a precision of 2. 3 x 10 - 10 s Hz- 0. 5 was achieved. (The peak fluorescence power was 500 ± 25 pW).

The potential of a range of sensors to detect tool degradation has been investigated and the outputs have been incorporated into a monitoring system. Progressive degradation under nominal rough and finish face milling and rough groove milling has been investigated using a two point grooving tool and four and eight point face milling tools on En 8, En 24 and En 24 T workpiece materials. Rapid degradation of the cutting tool has also been observed under rough milling conditions using four and eight point face milling tools, whilst machining n 8 and En 24 T materials in a variety of simulated and actual tool breakage situations. A limited investigation of the effect of the individual wear geometries associated with both progressive and instantaneous tool degradation has been conducted by simulating these geometries and carrying out rough miffing tests using a four point face milling tool on a workpiece of En 8 material. Similarly, a limited investigation of the effect of machining on different machines has also been undertaken. A number of different sensing technologies have been used, including conventional sensors such as spindle current and cutting force but also novel sensing techniques such as Acoustic Emission.

40|$|The Health and Safety Executive {{indicates}} that in United Kingdom, about five accidents per month involve exothermic runaway reactions, of which approximately half occur in batch or semibatch reactors. The {{major source of}} hazard comes from the highly reactive chemicals necessarily involved in many discontinuous processes and the strongly exothermic nature of many industrially important syntheses. In the event of loss of control, thermal runaway can result. Inappropriate engineering design for heat transfer, inadequate understanding of the process chemistry and thermodynamic, unsuitable control systems and inappropriate operational procedures, including training, have been highlighted as the prime causes {{of these types of}} incidents. Due to the importance of the field under consideration, most of the large companies and some universities and research centres have developed their own specific procedures for the safety assessment of highly reactive systems based on sophisticated instruments that can reproduce industrial processes at bench scale. However many fine and speciality chemicals are produced in Small and Medium Enterprises, SME, which usually do not have the necessary expertise to apply such methodologies. In addition, SME's frequently have limited resources so that there are severe constraints regarding the purchase or use of the type of expensive equipment sometimes needed for the testing methodologies. However, prevention of runaways and their consequences is of the highest priority for the chemical industry. Because of this, an important number of chemical companies, both, small and large, universities, and research centres have created HarsNet, supported by the European Commission. The acronym HarsNet means thematic network on hazard assessment of highly reactive systems. HarsNet is a thematic network included in the Industrial and Materials Technologies Programme (<b>Brite</b> <b>EuRam,</b> Project number: BET 2 - 0572) of the European Commission.

40|$|For non {{destructive}} stress analysis of surface treated steel samples {{the application of}} laboratory X rays or high energy synchrotron radiation in reflection mode covers the region from some micrometers up {{to a depth of}} about 150 200 amp; 956;m. To access depth regions deeper than 200 amp; 956;m the incremental layer removal technique in combination with the repeated application of X ray stress analysis for the newly generated surfaces can be used. However, this procedure is destructive, laborious and furthermore, it has to be checked whether corrections have to be applied due to stress relaxation. By using neutron radiation penetration depths generally up to several millimetres can be achieved {{non destructive}}ly. However neutron measurements are critical at the surface. When scanning a sample surface, aberration peak shifts caused by so called spurious strains arise {{due to the fact that}} the gauge volume defined by the primary and secondary optics is partially outside of the sample. These aberration peak shifts can be of the same order of magnitude as the peak shifts related to residual strains. In this exemplary study it will be demonstrated that, by optimising the bending radius of a Si 400 monochromator, the spurious surface strains can be strongly reduced when compared to the values obtained with a traditional Ge 311 mosaic monochromator, even when the gauge volume is mainly out of the surface. The objective of the experiments is to find the optimal monochromator settings for the Si 400 monochromator at the STRESS SPEC instrument at the research reactor FRM II, Munich, Germany. For the parametric studies a stress free steel sample of the fine grained construction steel, S 690 QL was used. The optimised conditions for the Si 400 monochromator that resulted from the systematic studies were applied to a shot peened plate of steel SAE 4140. The residual stress distribution is analysed by means of through surface strain scanning. The residual stress gradient obtained is in very good agreement with the well characterised residual stress depth profile obtained within a round robin test in the scope of the <b>BRITE</b> <b>EURAM</b> project ENSPED European Network of Surface and Prestress Engineering and Design.

40|$|The {{disadvantages}} of continuing industrialisation, such as environmental impacts and the decreasing resources of natural raw materials, {{have to be}} mitigated {{by the development of}} sustainable technologies. By studying geochemical processes and properties of natural materials, new sustainable processes can be designed. This field of study is known as Geochemical Engineering (Schuiling 1990, 1991). A typical example of Geochemical Engineering is the use of olivine for the neutralisation of industrial waste acids (Schuiling et al. 1986). Olivine, the fastest weathering silicate mineral, is available in large quantities and provides an excellent buffer for naturally produced acids. The use of olivine for the neutralization of industrial waste acids is therefore appealing. Compared to conventional methods for the neutralisation of waste acids, the use of olivine has the advantage that it produces valuable by-products, like precipitated silica and magnetic ferrites, while it generates no new waste streams (Schuiling et al. 1986). Since the olivine dissolution rate under natural conditions is too low for industrial application, the rate must be increased by raising the temperature or by using higher concentrations of acid or higher olivine surface areas. The properties of the first by-product, precipitated silica, depend strongly on the reaction conditions (Lieftink 1997). A wide range of precipitated silica qualities can be produced by varying temperature, grain size and quantity of olivine and acid concentration. The Olivine Process may, therefore, also be considered as an interesting alternative for current production processes of precipitated silica. The Olivine Proccess for the neutralization of waste acids was invented in 1985 at the University of Utrecht and patented (Duth Patent PCT NL 85 / 00026), the patent is currently owned by Geochem Research B. V. From 1986 - 1987 research on the improvement of the neutralization process and on applications of the neutralization products has been carried out, {{supported by a grant from}} the Dutch Ministry· of Housing and Environment (VROM).
