40|$|Ehrlichiosis is a {{group of}} diseases, usually named {{according}} to the host species and the type of white blood cell most often infected. Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by Ehrlichia canis and, occasionally, E. chaffeensis.

5|$|Hassium is {{not known}} to occur {{naturally}} on Earth; the half-lives of all its known isotopes are short enough that no primordial hassium would have survived to the present day. This does {{not rule out the}} possibility of unknown longer-lived isotopes or nuclear isomers existing, some of which could still exist in trace quantities today if they are long-lived enough. In the early 1960s, it was predicted that long-lived deformed isomers of hassium might occur naturally on Earth in trace quantities. This was theorized in order to explain the extreme radiation damage in some minerals that could not have <b>been</b> <b>caused</b> by any known natural radioisotopes, but could have <b>been</b> <b>caused</b> by superheavy elements.|$|E

It has been proposed that the whips {{could have been used}} in combat, but the tails of diplodocids were quite light and narrow compared to Shunosaurus and mamenchisaurids, and thus to injure another animal with the tail would severely injure the tail itself.|$|E
