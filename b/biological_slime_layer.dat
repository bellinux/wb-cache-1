40|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is a {{major issue}} in {{wastewater}} collection systems. H 2 S can cause rapid damage to wastewater infrastructure, affects the public’s quality of life through odor issues and is a safety concern for sewer workers. Relatively recent development and introduction of H 2 S data loggers has shown that H 2 S concentrations in the sewer headspace demonstrate a diurnal pattern that is not explained by current models. Odor complaints and toxicity are primarily a result of the peak concentration levels and may be more accurately predicted through {{a better understanding of the}} diurnal H 2 S concentration patterns. <b>Biological</b> <b>slime</b> <b>layer</b> grows in the submerged portion of sanitary sewer pipes and is the primary source of H 2 S in the sewer atmosphere. The diurnal hydraulic cycle common to sanitary sewer systems results in the periodic exposure of a portion of the slime layer. It was hypothesized that the diurnally exposed slime layer impacts the sewer atmosphere concentration of H 2 S. Utilizing laboratory style tests in a field sewer system showed that the slime layer, when exposed to the sewer atmosphere, will remove H 2 S. This has not been previously demonstrated and helps explain the diurnal H 2 S variation in the sewer atmosphere. Civil EngineeringMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|During 1986 and 1987, the City and County of Honolulu Board of Water Supply (BWS) placed {{granular}} {{activated carbon}} (GAC) water treatment plants in service at Mililani, Waipahu, and Kunia {{on the island of}} O'ahu, Hawai'i. The GAC treatment plants were designed to remove target organic chemicals DBCP, EDB, and TCP from well water in central O'ahu. Original operational cost estimates for the GAC treatment plants were based on carbon requirements determined through laboratory minicolumn experiments. Actual carbon usage rates, however, have proved to be several times higher than originally estimated. This study, which represents the first phase of a two-phase study to determine the potential for extending the effective life of GAC used to remove target organic chemicals from groundwater in central O'ahu, addresses the basic information necessary to understand the problem. Levels of target organic compounds in groundwater in the Pearl Harbor aquifer of central O’ahu {{do not appear to be}} decreasing significantly. In fact, based on the analysis of spent GAC samples from contactors at the Waipahu treatment facility, DBCP, which was previously undetected at the Waipahu wells, now appears to be occurring at low levels of a few nanograms per liter in groundwater near Waipahu. Analyses of spent carbon samples also indicate that the adsorptive capacity of the GAC for a particular compound is directly related to the concentration of that compound in the influent water. Total organic carbon (TOC) levels in groundwater samples from the Pearl Harbor basaltic aquifer are typically a few tenths of a milligram per liter. This concentration of background organics is two to three orders of magnitude greater than TCP, which is the target organic compound typically found at the highest concentrations in groundwater in the study area. TOC and infrared analyses indicate the presence of background organic compounds in groundwater, a factor which could shorten the service life of GAC contactors. Results of this study seem to indicate that inorganic cations and anions are not significantly adsorbed by the GAC. In addition to chemical effects, bacterial growth may also play a role in the adsorption of target organic compounds. Although -attached bacteria were recovered from spent GAC samples, subsequent scanning electron microscope analysis did not reveal a significant <b>biological</b> <b>slime</b> <b>layer</b> which may inhibit adsorption.

40|$|Five {{strains of}} type III pneumococcus {{have been shown}} to possess wide capsular <b>slime</b> <b>layers</b> during the {{logarithmic}} phase of growth in serum broth. The <b>slime</b> <b>layer</b> stains metachromatically with methylene blue and can be visualized under the electron microscope as a fuzzy halo which extends well beyond the surace of the capsule proper and causes centrifugates of the organism to be of extremely large volume. This outer capsular structure is most readily demonstrated in vivo and in nutrient broth containing glucose and serum. It disappears {{from the surface of the}} cell with aging of the culture, and is easily removed by dilute alkali, alcohol, and heat. Exposure of slime-covered type III pneumococci to homologous antibody and to type III polysaccharidase reveals that the <b>slime</b> <b>layer</b> contains the same type-specific polysaccharide that is present in the rest of the capsule. From a type III strain producing a prominent <b>slime</b> <b>layer</b> an intermediate mutant has been isolated which forms small non-mucoid colonies on blood agar and possesses a relatively small capsule with a barely discernible <b>slime</b> <b>layer.</b> The wide <b>slime</b> <b>layer</b> protects virulent type III pneumococci from surface phagocytosis.

40|$|Using {{a simple}} specific-antibody {{stabilization}} procedure on organisms gently liberated from their host cells, we have demonstrated by electron microscopy that Rickettsia prowazekii and Rickettsia rickettsii possess {{a coat of}} variable thickness, external to the outer leaflet of the cell wall and the structure designated by others as a "microcapsule," which corresponds most closely to the <b>slime</b> <b>layer</b> of certain other bacteria.

" Electron microscopy reveals that the microcapsular and <b>slime</b> <b>layers</b> of R. rickettsii undergo changes dependent upon the physiological conditions within the tick vector.

The type III pneumonia differed from that caused by pneumococcus I in that (a) death occurred more promptly in the type III infection, (b) the local pulmonary lesion became more heavily infected, and (c) frank suppuration was common even after otherwise effective chemotherapy. The greater pathogenicity of the type III organism was shown by special histologic techniques to be due primarily to its capsular <b>slime</b> <b>layer</b> which interferes with surface phagocytosis. Capsular polysaccharide shed from the organism during growth was also demonstrated in high concentration {{in certain parts of}} the pneumonic lesion. Removal of the excess polysaccharide from the alveoli resulted from (a) lymphatic drainage to regional lymph nodes and (b) phagocytosis, particularly by macrophages. The possible relationship of the free carbohydrate to the malignancy and the characteristically viscous exudate of type III pneumonia was discussed. The lung abscesses which resulted from type III infection were observed to occur in those areas in which the maximum number of organisms had accumulated.
