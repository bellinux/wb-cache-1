25|$|The early {{twenty-first century}} has {{continued}} to see secularism, humanism and atheism promoted in the Western world, with the general consensus being {{that the number of}} people not affiliated with any particular religion has increased. This has been assisted by non-profit organizations such as the Freedom From Religion Foundation in the United States (co-founded by Anne Nicol Gaylor and her daughter, Annie Laurie Gaylor, in 1976 and incorporated nationally in 1978, it promotes {{the separation of church and}} state), and the <b>Brights</b> movement, which aims to promote public understanding and acknowledgment of science through a naturalistic, scientific and irreligious worldview, defense of irreligious people's human, civil and political rights who share it, and their societal recognition. In addition, a large number of accessible antireligious, antitheist and secularist books, many of which have become bestsellers, have been published by scholars and scientists such as Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Christopher Hitchens, Lawrence M. Krauss, Jerry Coyne, and Victor J. Stenger between the mid-80's and 2014, especially during Bush administration (2000-2008).|$|E

2500|$|Broken <b>Brights</b> was {{released}} in Australia on 13 July, in the UK on 16 July, US on 17 July and France on 6 November 2012. The album {{was released}} on Nettwerk Records, in the US, EMI in Australia and UK, and Discograph in France. Foley lauded the release as [...] "othing short of stunning ... his most personal work to date ... demonstrates his versatility. It’s steeped in classic song-writing values, sound-checking without directly referencing the likes of the great American song-writers, from Petty to Dylan via Neil Young". Jen Wilson reviewed Broken <b>Brights</b> for Beat Magazine saying, [...] "within minutes you’re transported to another time ... Stone appears as a chameleon storyteller throughout Broken <b>Brights,</b> adapting with each theme and musical genre". Tony Hardy from Consequence of Sound said [...] "There’s always something unexpected around the corner". Triple J made Broken <b>Brights</b> their Album of the Week upon its release, and described it as [...] "a dreamy, chilled, nostalgic record which shows off Angus' unique songwriting".|$|E

2500|$|The {{album was}} built upon {{childhood}} influences such as Bob Dylan and The Eagles, {{the end result}} being very Dylanesque, laid-back with some rockier elements.

40|$|We studied early NK-cell {{recovery}} in 29 allografted patients undergoing different lymphoreductive regimens. Already at 2 ?wk after graft take, {{the number of}} NK cells had reached (supra) normal levels but NK-cell subsets were skewed. The number of CD 56 (dim) CD 16 (<b>bright)</b> NK cells was low and correlated strongly {{with the level of}} hematopoiesis, whereas the number of the more abundant NK cells expressing high levels of CD 56 did not. Post-transplant CD 56 (<b>bright)</b> NK cells (ptCD 56 (<b>bright))</b> differed from CD 56 (<b>bright)</b> NK cells in normal controls (CD 56 (<b>bright))</b> in being HLA-DR- and perforin-positive, CCR 7 (-), CD 27 (-), CD 127 (-) and mostly c-kit(-). CD 56 (<b>bright)</b> from normal controls stimulated by IL- 15 in vitro (NK(IL- 15)) acquired all the characteristics distinguishing CD 56 (<b>bright)</b> from ptCD 56 (<b>bright).</b> IL- 2 exerted similar effects. Moreover, when cultured without cytokines, ptCD 56 (<b>bright),</b> CD 56 (<b>bright)</b> and NK(IL- 15) responded similarly by upregulating CD 127 and c-kit but not CCR 7. IL- 12 stimulated IFN-? production in ptCD 56 (<b>bright),</b> whereas CD 56 (<b>bright)</b> responded only to IL- 12 plus IL- 15. Hence, ptCD 56 (<b>bright)</b> have all the features of cytokine-stimulated CD 56 (<b>bright).</b> Because only patients with low numbers of T cells had high numbers of ptCD 56 (<b>bright),</b> we conclude that ptCD 56 (<b>bright)</b> are activated CD 56 (<b>bright)</b> that expand while competing with T cells for the elevated post-transplant level of IL- 15...|$|R

2500|$|In late 2011 Stone {{began working}} on his second solo album, Broken <b>Brights.</b> He told Surfing World Magazine, “ecording with Julia is cool but we both have our hands on the wheel. This was an {{opportunity}} to grab the wheel and do some burn-outs". It was released in Australia on 13 July 2012 which peaked at No.2. The title track from the album was released as the lead single in March that year as a free download on Triple J’s Home and Hosed. The second single, [...] "Bird on the Buffalo", is a metaphor for a musing relationship between lovers. and the video features the actress Isabel Lucas. According to Indie Londons Jack Foley, the third single, [...] "Wooden Chair" [...] is [...] "mesmerising in a low-key, effortlessly brilliant manner that also manages to include an intoxicating background whistle. It’s breezy and romantic without really even trying to be". It was featured in the US TV show, Private Practice, in Season 6, Episode 3 [...] "Good Grief". The fourth single, [...] "Monsters", had its video premiered on The Huffington Post.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Brights</b> held {{in their}} house copies of essays written by John Stuart Mill, and young Helen Bright became {{especially}} interested in Mill's advocacy of the [...] "enfranchisement of women"—the idea {{that the right to}} vote should be extended to women. In 1861 she wrote to her step-cousin Agnes McLaren, [...] "how absurd to talk of repression and taxation going hand in hand, and all the while excluding wholly the one half of the population from the franchise." [...] In 1866 as Helen Bright she signed the [...] "Ladies' Petition" [...] on suffrage being circulated by Elizabeth Garrett and Emily Davies, as did her former teacher Hannah Wallis. The petition with its 1,499 signatures was presented by Mill to the House of Commons in June 1866. Later that year, Helen Bright married William Stephens Clark (1839–1925) of Street, Somerset. William Clark was a liberal Quaker, the owner of C. & J. Clark the shoe makers, and member of a family friendly to the idea of women's rights: his sister and niece had also signed the suffrage petition.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bright</b> (B-cell {{regulator}} of immunoglobulin {{heavy chain}} transcription) binding to immunoglobulin heavy chain loci after B-cell activation {{is associated with}} increased heavy chain transcription. Our earlier reports demonstrated that <b>Bright</b> coimmunoprecipitates with Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) and that these proteins associate in a DNA-binding complex in primary B cells. B cells from immunodeficient mice with a mutation in Btk failed to produce stable <b>Bright</b> DNA-binding complexes. In order to determine if Btk is important for <b>Bright</b> function, a transcription activation assay was established and analyzed using real-time PCR technology. Cells lacking both <b>Bright</b> and Btk were transfected with <b>Bright</b> and/or Btk along with an immunoglobulin heavy chain reporter construct. Immunoglobulin gene transcription was enhanced when <b>Bright</b> and Btk were coexpressed. In contrast, neither <b>Bright</b> nor Btk alone led to activation of heavy chain transcription. Furthermore, <b>Bright</b> function required both Btk kinase activity and sequences within the pleckstrin homology domain of Btk. <b>Bright</b> was not appreciably phosphorylated by Btk; however, a third tyrosine-phosphorylated protein coprecipitated with <b>Bright.</b> Thus, the ability of <b>Bright</b> to enhance immunoglobulin transcription critically requires functional Btk...|$|R
