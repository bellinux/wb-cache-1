40|$|Conventional {{propagation}} of <b>bulbous</b> <b>crops</b> must be supplemented with micropropagation {{to satisfy the}} requirements of present-day horticulture with respect to fast production of disease-free, superior starting material. Adequate micropropagation protocols for <b>bulbous</b> <b>crops</b> are therefore a sine qua non. The successive steps in micro{{propagation of}} <b>bulbous</b> <b>crops</b> are reviewed: initiation, multiplication, bulb formation, dormancy breaking and planting. In the first two steps, new shoots or bulblets are generated by axillary bud outgrowth or adventitious regeneration. During initiation, endogenous contamination may be a severe problem since bulbs grow subterraneously and have often been propagated vegetatively in the field for many years. Other drawbacks are insufficient axillary branching, poor adventitious regeneration and inferior growth. The latter, inferior growth, is likely the most significant problem and is caused by poor translocation of medium ingredients to the growing regions within the explant. In micropropagation of <b>bulbous</b> <b>crops,</b> bulblets should be produced because of, among others, easy handling and acclimatization. For optimal performance after planting in soil, preparatory treatments are required in particular a dormancy breaking treatment. A phase-change from juvenile to adult and protective pretreatments are also profitable. It is concluded that when major problems like that of inferior growth have been solved, commercial micropropagation of <b>bulbous</b> <b>crops</b> will experience a second heyday. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Most of the <b>bulbous</b> <b>crops,</b> viz., Crocus, Narcissus, Tulipa, Alstroemeria and Lilium {{that are}} commercially important, share certain common characteristics. The present day cultivars are all derived from hybrids between distantly related species, and {{in almost all}} cases {{spontaneous}} polyploidization has played a prominent role {{and there is a}} tendency to replace diploids by polyploid cultivars. Molecular cytogenetic techniques such as genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), along with other techniques, have greatly facilitated our understanding of the modes of origins of polyploids. Because the <b>bulbous</b> <b>crops</b> generally have large chromosomes, the parental genomes, individual chromosomes, as well as intergenomic recombinant chromosomes, can be accurately identified in the interspecific hybrids and their backcross progenies. This enables an assessment of the potential genetic variation that might occur in the progenies as well as the extent of introgression. Although the superiority of polyploids as compared to their diploid parents is beyond doubt, the actual explanation for their superiority is still elusive. Of the several explanations, chromosome dosage, optimal amounts of 4 C DNA values of the complements, heterozygosity and favourable gene interactions transmitted by the 2 n gametes to polyploid progenies are some of the factors that might be considered at present. Undoubtedly, more studies on the <b>bulbous</b> ornamental <b>crops</b> using molecular techniques might be rewarding...|$|R
40|$|Although tulip {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} <b>bulbous</b> <b>crops</b> worldwide, the genetic background of most cultivars is unclear at present. The purposes of this study are to investigate genetic diversity and to identify the genetic structure and relationships among tulip cultivars. A total of 236 polymorphic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained from 'Kees Nelis' and 'Cantata', from which 121 SNPs with a minor allele frequency above 0. 1 were selected for genetic analysis. The total observed heterozygosity (Ho) among the 72 accessions was 0. 35, Ho of cultivar groups ranged from 0. 22 (Tulipa fosteriana) to 0. 43 (Tulipa gesneriana x T. fosteriana hybrids). Rather small genetic distances were found among T. gesneriana cultivar groups which are defined according to flowering time and morphology. In both PCoA (principle coordinate analysis) and STRUCTURE analysis, the 72 accessions were separated into three clusters (F-ST = 0. 208,...|$|R
40|$|Local {{areas of}} conserved amino acid {{sequence}} in the replicase and coat proteins of potyviruses were used to select nucleotide sequences {{for use in the}} construction of sets of degenerate oligonucleotide primers for amplification of DNA fragments on potyvirus-specific templates in a combined assay of reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Sequences selected for the construction of degenerate primers included the coat protein gene sequence of tulip breaking virus from lily, which is reported in this paper. It is shown that the degenerate primers support potyvirus-specific amplification, but do not support amplification on carlavirus and potexvirus templates. A panel consisting of definite and prospective members of the potyvirus group occurring in <b>bulbous</b> <b>crops</b> was subjected to the degenerate primer RT-PCR assay; amplified fragments were used in cross-hybridization experiments and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis to detect relationships among these potyviruses. A partially characterized virus isolated from Gloriosa rothschildiana was positively identified as a potyvirus by specific amplification and subsequent sequence analysis of an amplified DNA fragment...|$|R

Nevertheless these systems have high investment and running costs and {{must rely on}} high quality water, which is not always available in Mediterranean coastal regions. With the aim of contributing to the improvement of hydroponic cut flower cultivation in Southern Italy, experiments were carried out on two cultivars of Curcuma alismatifolia Gagnep (‘Pink’and 'White') to verify the response of this species to a closed growing systems. In addition, the effects of increasing the salinity of the recirculating nutrient solution (0 %; 0. 125 % and 0. 25 % NaCl) were investigated on the cultivar ‘Pink’. During the experiment plant growth, number of cut flower per plant, gas exchange, water relations and leaf mineral concentration were measured. The results demonstrated that nutrients and water use efficiencies can be considerably improved upon introduction of closed soilless systems. These systems are suitable for cultivation of crops with short growing cycle such as Curcuma and other <b>bulbous</b> <b>crops</b> also in presence of moderately saline water. Indeed, since to an increasing water salinity corresponded decreasing leaf area end total plant biomass, the water uptakes were reduced. There was also a clear effect of salinity on cut flower yield and mineral composition of leaves and rhizomes that suggested to adjust the fertilizer concentration to the growth phases of the plant...|$|R
40|$|Several <b>bulbous</b> <b>crops</b> like Crocus, Allium {{and some}} species of Tulipa and Narcissus can be {{infected}} with the nematode Aphelenchoides subtenuis. The nematodes cause retarded growth, poor or no flowering and eventually death of the bulbs and corms. A hot water treatment after lifting the bulbs {{has proved to be}} effective in controlling the nematodes. Due to a high incidence of infected stocks of bulbs a study was conducted to establish if the efficacy of the treatment could be improved by altering the timing and the temperature of the hot water treatment and the storage temperature of the bulbs prior to the hot water treatment. Bulbs and corms of Allium and Crocus were given a hot water treatment of four hours at 43. 5 or 45 °C. Between lifting and the hot water treatment the bulbs were stored at 25 or 30 °C. Prior to the hot water treatment some of the bulbs were immersed in water for 24 hours. The hot water treatment was performed at 7, 10, 12 or 14 days after lifting the bulbs or corms. Controlling Aphelenchoides subtenuis was only effective when the hot water treatment of four hours at 45 °C was applied within 10 to 14 days after lifting the bulbs. When Crocus was stored at 30 °C a hot water treatment was only effective until 10 days after lifting. When stored at 25 °C a treatment was effective until 14 days after lifting. The hot water treatment became more effective when the bulbs were immersed in water for 24 hours prior to the hot water treatment...|$|R
40|$|Onion (Allium cepa L.) is an {{important}} <b>bulbous</b> vegetable <b>crop</b> grown in India from the ancient times. The crop is grown for green vegetable as well as mature bulbs. It is popular salad crop and also widely used as a cooked vegetable in soups, stews and casseroles as flavouring in many dishes. The outstanding characteristics of onion are the pungency {{which is due to}} volatile oil known as “Allyl-propyl-disulphides”. Because of its importance in cookery, onion is called “queen of the kitchen ” by Germans. The integrated methods of weed control offer the possibilities of increasing crop production under weed free environment by keeping the crop more healthy by suppressing the weeds, competing for nutrients and sunlight. Hence there is imperative need to screen out suitable herbicides for weed control along with manual weeding/soil stiring in onion bulb crop under different spacing.

In field experiments the effects of various pre-crops and organic amendments on the TRV Infection Potential of Soils (TRV-IPS) and on disease level in tulip and gladiolus were studied. Organic matter amendment of soil {{at a rate of}} 1 % dry weight has been shown to reduce the host finding activity of P. teres under laboratory conditions. In a field containing viruliferous P. teres dahlia, italian ryegrass, white mustard and fodder radish were grown or the soil was kept fallow and the resulting TRV-IPS prior to the <b>bulbous</b> test <b>crops</b> was measured by a soil dilution bait test method. The application of organic matter was tested after dahlia as pre-crop. Household waste compost (GFT compost) was applied as a soil mix or planting furrow treatment at 12 tons dry weight per ha for tulip and gladiolus. Spent mushroom compost (Champost) was added as planting furrow treatment at 17 or 12 tons dw/ha, respectively, for tulip and gladiolus. The percentage of TRV diseased plants was determined at flowering in all pre-crop and organic amendment treatments. Champost in the planting furrow and fodder radish as a preceding crop reduced the percentage infection in tulip under favourable conditions for TRV infection. In gladiolus most organic amendments, fodder radish as pre-crop and keeping the soil fallow reduced the TRV infection rate of the plants during the first growing season, but not of the plants grown from the corms in the next year...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Curcuma alismatifolia Gagnep., {{commonly}} known as 'Thai tulip' or pathumma {{is a member of}} the family Zingiberaceae. This herbaceous perennial which can be grown from rhizomes have a great potential for use as a cut flower, flowering potted plant and as a garden plant for tropical landscaping. Unlike other <b>bulbous</b> floral <b>crops,</b> research on C. alismatifolia using gamma irradiation has been a least subject of investigation. Approach: Presently, the use of induced mutation in plant improvement had become a proven way that can generate new sources of genetic variations in creating new varieties. This additional tool is important in plant improvement, which was a valuable approach to plant breeding in the world of ornamental industry. A study on the effects of gamma irradiation on mutagenesis of Curcuma alismatifolia was conducted to determine the optimal dose for radiosensitivity test (LD 50) of the plants and also to determine the effects of induced mutation on the species. This study was carried out at the Malaysian Nuclear Agency (Nuclear Malaysia), Bangi. Ten levels (dose rate) of gamma irradiation were used in this study. Data collection for days of shoot emergence, plants height, number of leaves and shoots, days to bloom, height of flowering stalks, inflorescence size and the days to anthesis (post-production longevity) were taken. Results: Results obtained showed that the highest survival rate was 67 % obtained from the non-irradiated rhizomes (0 Gy). Fifty percent when were treated with 10 Gy and 63 % survival rate when treated at 20 Gy. Mean survival rate fell sharply from 63 % at 20 Gy to 7 % at 30 Gy. This decreasing trend was followed by 2 % survival at 40 Gy. Results indicated that the radiosensitivity test (LD 50) for the Curcuma alismatifolia was approximately at 25 Gy. Conclusion: Gamma irradiation had exerted various effects on growth of C. alismatifolia, including the survival rate of rhizomes, extension of days to shoot emergence, plant height, leaves and shoots number as well as modifications in plant morphology and flower development...|$|R
40|$|The {{ornamental}} {{industry has}} become an important economic force in recent years, in the UK alone this industry {{is estimated to be}} around £ 2. 1 billion, while the international trade is around £ 60 - 75 billion (Chandler and Tanaka, 2007). The continued success of the floriculture industry depends on the introduction of new species/cultivars with major alterations in key agronomic characteristics, such as resistance to pathogens, novel flower colour and patterns or control of male fertility. Lilium, {{one of the most important}} <b>bulbous</b> ornamental <b>crops,</b> is an attractive and popular cut flower. However, the production of vast quantities of pollen that stains easily and is toxic to animals is not always desirable. The control of pollen release without affecting the appearance of the flower is therefore an important breeding goal. Lilium is also susceptible to several fungal pathogens, including Botrytis cinerea, which infects leaves, stem and flowers leading to a reduction of yield. New cultivars have tended to rely upon selective breeding as a mechanism for trait development. However approaches that utilise transgenes to manipulate traits of interest provide alternative opportunities for the ornamental industry provided that transformation and regeneration can be achieved efficiently. A rapid, highly efficient and reproducible Agrobacterium-mediated transformation for Liium has been developed. Successful transient GUS expression in callus, shoots and basal plate discs was achieved using A tumefaciens strain AGL 1 containing plasmid pBI 121 harbouring intron-containing GUS and NPTII genes in cultivars "Beverly's Dream", "Star Gazer", "Night Flyer", "Acapulco", "Sweet Surrender" and Lilium leichtlinii. Based on the same transformation protocol, transgenic plants of cv. "Star Gazer" overexpressing the RCHIO chitinase gene from rice were generated. In vitro sporulation assays of these plants showed different levels of resistance to Botrytis cinerea correlated to the level of relative expression of the transgene. This is the first report of induced pathogen resistance in any Lilium cultivar by transgenic approach. Experiments were also conducted to modify fertility and pollen release in Lilium by translating regulatory gene information from Arabidopsis to Lilium. Transgenic plants of cv. "Star Gazer" either overexpressing or silencing the AtMYB 26 gene, were generated. RNAi lines showed a delay in anther dehiscence suggesting that pollen development pathways could be conserved between Arabidopsis and Lilium. In addition, partial sequences of the putative orthologues of AtMS 1 and AtMYB 26 in Lilium were identified and cloned for future research.

40|$|Lilies (Lilium L.) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} ornamental <b>bulbous</b> <b>crops</b> for cut flower industry grown extensively in The Netherlands for last few decades. The genus Lilium consists of seven different sections with about 80 species. The species within genus Lilium (2 n = 2 x = 24) comprise a range of desirable and complementary characters. Besides being an important horticultural crop, lily (Lilium) also serves as an interesting model plant for molecular cytogenetic research and introgression breeding for several reasons like, i). Lily is a model crop for interspecific hybridization and it includes plants of different taxonomic species each of which possess valuable horticultural traits that need to be combined in the new cultivars. ii) Through careful selection n and 2 n gametes can be obtained in interspecific hybrids. iii) The genomes of different species are so well differentiated genetically that the parental chromosomes can be clearly identified in the F 1 hybrids as well as in the progenies through DNA in situ hybridization techniques. iv) The chromosomes are large enough and the number and position of homoeologous recombination sites can be clearly detected. v) The large and easily identified chromosomes in different lily species could be a potential source for the cytological mapping of the Lilium genomes. Taking advantage of these favourable attributes of lily, a molecular cytogenetic investigation was conducted to evaluate the amount of recombination and introgression of characters between Longiflorum - Asiatic (LA) and Oriental - Asiatic (OA) hybrids through the use of n and 2 n gametes. For this purpose different F 1 Longiflorum × Asiatic (LA) and Oriental × Asiatic (OA) hybrids were backcrossed with different Asiatic cultivars. Ovule and embryo rescue techniques were employed to get backcross (BC) progenies. Most of the F 1 LA appeared to be sterile but some hybrids were able to produce only 2 n gametes in considerable frequencies. However, in rare occasions it was also found that normal meiosis took place in few of the LA hybrids which resulted into the formation of normal n gametes. Ploidy level and intergenomic recombination was studied in LA interspecific hybrids in order to assess the possibility of functional n gametes and their potential use in introgression at diploid level in lily. A total of 104 BC 1 LA interspecific lily hybrids were obtained, 27 diploids (2 n = 2 x = 24), 73 triploids (2 n = 2 x = 36) and 4 aneuploids (2 x – 1, 2 x + 2 or 2 x + 3). Similarly, triploid BC 1 (LAA) plants were backcrossed to diploid Asiatic parents. As a result 14 diploid BC 2 progenies were produced. The intergenomic recombination and amount of introgression of respective genome (L and A) was assessed in these diploid genotypes through GISH (Genomic in situ Hybridization). Extensive intergenomic recombination was found among the chromosomes in LA hybrids. A large of amount of L- genome was transmitted from F 1 LA hybrids to their subsequent BC 1 progenies. However, very few segments of L- genome were introgressed from the BC 1 diploid and triploid (LAA) plants to the BC 2 progenies (Chapter 2). GISH identifies a considerable amount of recombination events amongst different interspecific lily hybrids (LA and OA) obtained from functional 2 n gametes. Based on recombination sites on different chromosomes identified by GISH, cytological maps of three genomes of Lilium were constructed. For this purpose, BC progenies of two diploid interspecific hybrids of lily, viz., Longiflorum × Asiatic (LA) and Oriental × Asiatic (OA) were used. The BC progenies of LA hybrids consisted of both triploid (2 n = 3 x = 36) and diploid (2 n = 2 x = 24) with some aneuploid genotypes and those of OA hybrids mostly consisted of triploid (2 n = 3 x = 36) and some aneuploid genotypes. In LA hybrids 248 recombination sites were cytologically localized on 12 different chromosomes of each genomes (i. e., L and A). Similarly, 116 recombinant sites were marked on 12 chromosomes each from the BC progenies of OA hybrids (O and A genomes). The distances of the recombination sites from the centromeres are measured (in micrometres). Based on these recombination sites four cytological maps were constructed. Since an Asiatic parent was involved in both hybrids, viz., LA and OA, two maps were constructed for A genome which were indicated as Asiatic (L) and Asiatic (O) and one each for Longiflorum (A) and Oriental (A) genomes (Chapter 3). With a view to generate genetic variation via homoeologous recombination in BC progenies of LA and OA hybrids the most logical approach was the use of 2 n gametes. 63 BC 1 LA (LA × AA or AA × LA) and 53 OA (AA × OA) progeny plants were obtained after unilateral sexual polyploidization. 16 genotypes from F 2 LA populations were obtained after bilateral sexual polyploidization through sib-mating of F 1 LA hybrids. GISH was employed for the identification of the parental genomes, mode of origin of these progenies and measurement of the introgression in different interspecific lily hybrids. Most of the BC 1 progeny plants (LA and OA) had originated through 2 n gametes by First Division Restitution (FDR) mechanism. However, there were 12 genotypes in LA hybrids and four genotypes in OA hybrids that originated through 2 n gametes formation as the result of Indeterminate Meiotic Restitution (IMR). A higher amount of recombination was found in LA hybrids as compared to OA hybrids. Intergenomic recombination was also determined in the sib-mated F 2 LA population. In this case both parents had contributed gametes with the somatic number of chromosomes (i. e., 2 n- 2 n) thus confirming the event of bilateral sexual polyploidization in interspecific LA hybrids. Based on these results, the relevance of interspecific lily hybrids obtained from uni- and bilateral sexual polyploidization leading to allotriploid and allotetraploid formation in interspecific lily hybrids is discussed in the context of introgression and mapping (Chapter 4). Molecular markers are an important tool for the construction of genetic linkage maps, as the first step in the genetic dissection of the required traits leading to crop improvement followed by the marker assisted breeding in different plants. Lilium has one of the largest genome in plant kingdom and genetic mapping in lilies is constrained by its large genome. DArT (Diversity Array Technology), a molecular marker technique can detect and type DNA variation at several hundred genomic loci in parallel without relying on genome sequence information. The DArT technique was developed for Longiflorum × Asiatic (LA) lily hybrids to enable an efficient and effective genetic mapping with the production of a large numbers of markers in microarrays-based assay. The restriction enzyme PstI + TaqI combination generated the largest frequency of polymorphic genomic representations for a genotyping array. Genomic representations from 88 F 1 LA plants were used to assemble a DArT genotyping microarray. A total of 687 DArT markers were developed and 382 polymorphic markers were mapped on 14 main linkage groups which is two more then the haploid chromosome number (i. e. n = 12). The resulting linkage map with 382 DArT markers spanned 1329 cM (3. 5 cM/marker on average). The results highlighted the potential of DArT as a genetic technique for genome profiling in the context of molecular breeding and genomics, especially in crops with large genome sizes where other techniques proved to be less useful (Chapter 5). The results of the present investigation are of practical implication. These results show the advantages of the n gametes and their subsequent progenies which opened a new approach of lily breeding ‘the analytic breeding’ in the allopolyploids. It also shows the possibility of using certain triploid hybrids for further breeding. A comparison has been made between different types of interspecific crosses, the amount of intergenomic recombination and introgressions of chromosomal segments obtained after unilateral sexual polyploidization. Furthermore, bilateral sexually polyploidization via sib-mated F 1 hybrids producing 2 n gametes has been proven. The use of allotetraploids obtained from bilateral sexual polyploidization could be a novel approach in the breeding of LA-hybrids. These allotetraploid with recombinant chromosomal segment may be a potential source to generate genetic variation in subsequent progenies. The molecular cytogenetic GISH and FISH techniques proved to be a powerful tool useful for the construction of cytogenetic maps in interspecific crosses in crops with large genomes sizes like lily. These techniques are also used for the identification and integration of genetic maps with chromosome maps. FISH also helps to monitor the introgressed chromosome segment or marker of interest in the subsequent progenies. Application of the DArT technique proved to be an effective method to construct genetic linkage maps especially crops (like Lilium) with large genome sizes where other techniques might be less useful...|$|R
