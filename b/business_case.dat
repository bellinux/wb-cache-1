5|$|Holden began {{assembling}} the compact HA series Vauxhall Viva in 1964. This was superseded by the Holden Torana in 1967, a {{development of the}} Viva ending Vauxhall production in Australia. Holden offered the LC, a Torana with new styling, in 1969 with the availability of Holden's six-cylinder engine. In the development days, the six-cylinder Torana was reserved for motor racing, but research had shown {{that there was a}} <b>business</b> <b>case</b> for such a model. The LC Torana was the first application of Holden's new three-speed Tri-Matic automatic transmission. This was the result of Holden's A$16.5million transformation of the Woodville, South Australia factory for its production.|$|E
5|$|Market {{research}} conducting during 1997 {{revealed that}} airlines wanted a smaller {{aircraft in the}} 70-80-seat range. As the project proceeded, there were increasing disagreements between the Chinese side and Airbus. China wanted a larger aircraft than originally envisioned. In addition, there were difficulties arising out of negotiations about technology transfer and production workshare, and a weak <b>business</b> <b>case.</b> STAe, having previously expressed doubts about returns on the project, in 1998 withdrew from the project out of the failure between AIA and AVIC to reach an agreement; Airbus and AVIC would cancel the project in July that year. The A318 {{is believed to have}} emerged from the AE31X project though an Airbus-only project, named the A319M5 in 1995, began before the AE31X cancellation.|$|E

Contract negotiations finished in April 2008, and construction started in June 2008. By this stage {{the cost of the}} project was estimated at £521 million. Funding problems and political disputes led to the scaling back of the original plans. In April 2009, the council cancelled phase 1b, citing revenue shortfall created by the economic slowdown to save an estimated £75 million. The Granton extension was also cancelled.|$|E

5|$|The Mitchell Freeway {{is planned}} to {{continue}} {{north to the}} Metropolitan Region Scheme's boundary, beyond Yanchep and Two Rocks. The state government announced in March 2012 {{the formation of the}} Mitchell Freeway Extension Community Working Group. The group worked with Main Roads Western Australia to investigate options for relieving congestion, with a focus on the next freeway extension. Several options were considered, before the group released a strategic <b>business</b> <b>case</b> in November 2012. The report recommends a staged approach, starting with intersection improvements between 2013 and 2015. This would be followed by a freeway extension to Hester Avenue, by 2017 and then an expressway standard extension to Romeo Road, Alkimos by 2021. Half-diamond interchanges are suggested for Neerabup Road and Hester Avenue.|$|E
5|$|A project {{board was}} {{established}} in January 2009, {{with the objective of}} ensuring the stadium be built by 2012. City councillors approved the outline <b>business</b> <b>case</b> for the stadium in June 2009, meaning officials could start searching for sites. Four sites were put forward to the council in June 2010, and York City favoured the option of building a 6,000 all-seater stadium at Monks Cross in Huntington, to the north of York, on the site of Huntington Stadium, which would be ready by 2014 at the earliest. Mark Stead of The Press noted the advantages of this site, including the potential for land value to include, the opportunity to build health and fitness facilities and commercial interest, and the disadvantages, including a scheduled ancient monument being located on adjacent land and traffic concerns. In July 2010, this location was chosen by the council executive as their preferred option.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, a <b>business</b> <b>case</b> was {{developed}} with three options {{to extend the}} life of the fleet. The first two options involved expanding the service life extension program (SLEP) at a cost of $4.6 billion and $3.16 billion respectively. The third option, worth $1.72 billion, was to build 242 new wings and avoid the cost of expanding the SLEP. In 2006, option 3 was chosen and Boeing won the contract. The base contract is for 117 wings with options for 125 additional wings. In 2013, the Air Force exercised a portion of the option to add 56 wings, putting 173 wings on order with options remaining for 69 additional wings. In November 2011, two A-10s flew with the new wings fitted. The new wings improved mission readiness, decreased maintenance costs, and allowed the A-10 to be operated up to 2035 if necessary. The re-winging effort was organized under the thick-skin urgent spares kitting (TUSK) program.|$|E

5|$|Tonkin Highway reaches {{past the}} edge of {{suburbia}} at its southern extent. Planning provides {{for it to be}} extended when required. The initial plans indicated the extension would continue south through undeveloped or semi-rural areas such as Mundijong, Cardup & Jarrahdale. South of Mundijong, the planned route would deviate east to terminate at South Western Highway near Jarrahdale Road, which would then be upgraded. Following the 2001state election, the new government abandoned the Jarrahdale Road option, preferring a shorter route that deviated to South Western Highway near Orton Street, closer to Byford. In July 2012, seven years after the previous extension was completed, the Minister for Transport announced the formation of a community working group to investigate an extension of Tonkin Highway beyond Thomas Road. The group met several times to identify and evaluate possible solutions to traffic congestion in the area, and prepare a strategic <b>business</b> <b>case</b> for the next extension. , the preferred options are to extend the highway to South Western Highway, at a location either south of Lakes Road or south of Mundijong Road.|$|E
