5|$|Norwegian {{building}} traditions. While it may <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> {{speak of}} a renaissance in traditional Norwegian architecture, more and more urban planning {{is affected by the}} need to preserve or restore these traditions. Examples include plans to renew the center of Oppdal and recent work at the Oslo neighborhood of Grünerløkka.|$|E
500|$|After the Denning Report, in {{defiance}} of general expectations that he would resign shortly, Macmillan announced his intention to stay on. On {{the eve of the}} Conservative Party's annual conference in October 1963 he fell ill; his condition was less serious than he imagined, and his life was not in danger [...] but, convinced he had cancer, he resigned abruptly. [...] His successor as prime minister was Lord Home, who renounced his peerage and served as Sir Alec Douglas-Home. In the October 1964 general election the Conservative Party was narrowly defeated, and Wilson became prime minister. A later commentator opined that the Profumo affair had destroyed the old, aristocratic Conservative party: [...] "It wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> say that the Profumo scandal was the necessary prelude to the new Toryism, based on meritocracy, which would eventually emerge under Margaret Thatcher". The Economist suggested that the Profumo affair had effected a fundamental and permanent change in relations between politicians and press. Davenport-Hines posits a longer-term consequence of the affair—the gradual ending of traditional notions of deference: [...] "Authority, however disinterested, well-qualified and experienced, was [...] increasingly greeted with suspicion rather than trust".|$|E
500|$|The {{scale of}} the project was enormous: By the time Gygax and Kuntz had stopped working on their {{original}} home campaign, the castle dungeons had encompassed 50 levels of cunningly complex passages with thousands of rooms and traps. This, plus plans for the city of Yggsburgh and encounter areas outside the castle and city, would clearly <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> fit into the proposed 6 volumes. Gygax decided he would compress the castle dungeons into 13 levels, the size of his original Castle Greyhawk in 1973 by amalgamating the best of what could be gleaned from binders and boxes of old notes. However, neither Gygax nor Kuntz had kept careful or comprehensive plans. Because they had often made up details of play sessions on the spot, they usually just scribbled a quick map as they played, with cursory notes about monsters, treasures, and traps. These sketchy maps had contained just enough detail that the two could ensure their independent work would dovetail. All of these old notes now had to be deciphered, 25-year-old memories dredged up as to what had happened in each room, and a decision made whether to keep or discard each new piece. Recreating the city too would be a challenge. [...] Although Gygax still had his old maps of the original city, all of his previously published work on the city was owned by WotC, so he would have to create most of the city from scratch while still maintaining the [...] "look and feel" [...] of his original.|$|E

60|$|This <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> borne, and Frank rode up {{red with}} passion; {{and a lot}} of others, {{including}} the whipper, soon followed.|$|R
2500|$|The Australian {{team made}} a {{positive}} {{impression on the}} New Zealand public during the tour and Campese was among those celebrated for his entertaining style of play. New Zealand rugby journalist Terry McLean, in the New Zealand Herald, wrote after the tour that, [...] "It would not <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> {{say that this was}} the most significant Wallaby team ever to tour New Zealand." [...] McLean praised Campese, stating that he [...] "could side-step his way out of a sealed paper bag". All Black winger Stu Wilson later said of Campese that, [...] "He made life hell for me for three tests." ...|$|E

6000|$|VALENTINE. Thank you, I'm used to them. Would it <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> {{ask you to}} wait {{five minutes}} while I get rid of my {{landlord}} downstairs? ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{eight o'clock}} the engine came nosing in, and while {{watching}} the line of passengers descend, I lost hope. It <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> expect! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm not,' she protested. 'I'm {{not afraid}} of other things. But black-beetles--ugh!' she shuddered convulsively, as if the very thought <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> bear.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid that}} <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> expect, Sam. But I am glad {{he remembered the}} whistle, anyway. It shows that he hasn't {{forgotten}} everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would have}} given the same pledge to you, Lucy, and purely on your own account. It would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> cause you to mourn for your brother's--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! {{there is}} but one Mrs. Hawker in New-York," [...] {{answered}} Grace, [...] "and not many Mrs. Bloomfields in the world. It would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> say, we have even half-a-dozen such houses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Her husband!" [...] said Sir Amyas. [...] "Her husband {{from whom}} she has been cruelly {{spirited}} away. Aid me to bring her back, my good fellow, and nothing would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> reward you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'God forbid!' was the reply. 'And yet {{the name}} is a strange one; it <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> fancy two. Tell me, landlord, is he old?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We will utter an edict {{to secure}} your privacy," [...] said the Duke; [...] "and {{you do not}} think," [...] he added, {{lowering}} his voice to a confidential whisper, [...] "that ten thousand <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> pay to the Sovereign, in name of wardship?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A good name," [...] Sir Timothy murmured. [...] "I am sure I {{wish you}} both every good fortune in your quest. Would it <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> ask you now, Mr. Ledsam, for that single minute alone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course not!" [...] agreed Derek in a {{comfortable}} glow of manly remorse. He liked himself {{in the character of}} the strong man abashed. [...] "It would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> expect, I know. But, when we are married...." ...|$|E
60|$|Sir John {{strode to}} the door and shouted; it would not <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> say that he {{bellowed}} like a bull. It opened after a while, and a serving-man appeared, a bow-legged, sturdy-looking fellow with a shock of black hair.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{its opening}} in 1998, {{the museum was}} run {{completely}} by volunteers. However, the 5,000 visitors received that year <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> handled solely by volunteers.|$|R

60|$|Muf. Thou say'st true, a very {{considerable}} sum: {{he shall}} not die, {{though he had}} committed folly with a slave; it <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> lose by him.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{she brings}} my boy home, I'll never say another word. She may marry every nephew I've got, if she likes, and I'll give her my blessing," [...] exclaimed Aunt Plenty, feeling that no price would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> pay {{for such a}} deed.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{it would}} <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> say that faith alone {{caused him to}} look lightly upon this sudden, tragic ending of his {{brilliant}} career, but it undoubtedly helped him to preserve that easy and unembittered frame of mind of the philosopher, who, with life, loses that which hath but little value.|$|E
6000|$|... "She knows a great deal, and I {{know enough}} to feel that she's a kind of {{emanation}} of the great democracy--of the continent, the country, the nation. I don't say that she sums it all up, that would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> ask of her. But she suggests it; she vividly figures it." ...|$|E

60|$|The Irishman and his {{daughter}} also rose, and got out. I watched them leave stoically. It would have <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> expect {{that they should be}} going any further.|$|R

'You {{are in a}} nice {{state of}} confugion, Mr Sweedlepipes, you are!' said Mrs Gamp, shaking her head; 'and my opinion is, as half-a-dudgeon fresh young lively leeches on your temples, wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> clear your mind, which so I tell you.

6000|$|... "It's not my {{business}} how passengers board these cars, {{so long as}} they're tolerably decent, and can pay their fare," [...] observed the conductor.

60|$|It would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> {{say that}} Sedleigh had {{any hope of}} pulling the game out of the fire; {{but it was a}} comfort, they felt, at any rate, having another knock.
