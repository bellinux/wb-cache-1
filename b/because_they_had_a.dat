5|$|On April 2, the Bears began a {{voluntary}} offseason program, and <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> new head coach, the Bears {{were given a}} two-week earlier start than teams that did not hire a new head coach. For {{the first two weeks}} of the program, the only activities allowed were strength and conditioning and rehabilitation, and only strength and conditioning coaches are allowed to be on the field with the players. On the third week, {{a voluntary}} minicamp was held, and all coaches were permitted to work. From April 16–18, the Bears held two-hour non-contact drills, and held ten organized team activities (OTAs) during May 13 – June 6, followed by a mandatory minicamp from June 11–13.|$|E
5|$|The Finnish State Railways (VR) ordered five {{units in}} 1959, {{but these were}} {{cancelled}} for political reasons. The units were offered to NSB for a reduced price. Three were designated Di 3b <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> slight specification variation, with a (A1A)'(A1A)' wheel arrangement and higher top speed. Two units had come short enough in the production process {{that they could be}} given the same specifications as the other Di 3a units, but received a slightly longer body. The Di 3b were given the numbers 641–643. For part of 1960, no. 623 was leased by NOHAB and sent on a demonstration tour in Eastern Europe. This resulted in an order from the Hungarian State Railways, where it became the MAV M61. The Røros Line was upgraded and the Bergen Line units transferred to Trondheim in 1960, but increased need for hauling forced NSB to not use the units on the Røros Line until the delivery of the next batch of six units in 1965. The final delivery, of four units, was made in 1969.|$|E
5|$|The German UB II design {{improved}} {{upon the}} design of the UB I boats, which had been ordered in September 1914. In service, the UB I boats were found to be too small and too slow. A major problem was that, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> single propeller shaft/engine combo, if either component failed, the U-boat became almost totally disabled. To rectify this flaw, the UB II boats featured twin propeller shafts and twin engines (one shaft for each engine), which also increased the U-boat's top speed. The new design also included more powerful batteries, larger torpedo tubes, and a deck gun. As a UB II boat, U-43 could also carry twice the torpedo load of her UB I counterparts, and nearly ten times as much fuel. To accommodate all of these changes the boats' had larger hulls, and surface and submerged displacements more than twice those of the UB I boats.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the middle}} of the 19th century, there was no {{standardization}} of surnames in the Philippines. There were native Filipinos without surnames, others whose surnames deliberately did not match that of their families, {{as well as those who}} took certain surnames simply <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> certain prestige, usually ones related to the Roman Catholic religion, such as de los Santos ("of the saints") and de la Cruz ("of the cross").|$|E
25|$|The British {{began to}} assess the impact of the Blitz in August 1941 and the RAF Air Staff used the German {{experience}} to improve Bomber Command's offensives. They concluded bombers should strike a single target each night and use more incendiaries, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> greater impact on production than high explosives. They also noted regional production was severely disrupted when city centres were devastated through the loss of administrative offices, utilities and transport. They believed the Luftwaffe had failed in precision attack and concluded the German example of area attack using incendiaries was the way forward for operations over Germany.|$|E

25|$|In 1702–1703, Russian troops {{captured}} the Swedish fortresses of Noteborg and Nyenskans on the Neva river that provided Russia an outlet to the Baltic Sea. A series of measures {{were taken in}} the spring and autumn of 1703 to protect the conquered territories, such as raising the fortresses of St. Petersburg (on Zayachy Island {{at the mouth of the}} Neva), and Kronstadt (on the island of Kotlin). Construction of ships of the newly created Baltic Fleet started only in August 1708 – January 1709 with four 50-gun ships of the line named Riga, Vyborg, Pernov and one untitled.

25|$|After Superman IV in 1987, Reeve's {{relationship}} with Exton fell apart, and they separated. He moved to New York without his children. He became depressed {{and decided that}} doing a comedy might be good for him. He was given a lead in Switching Channels. Burt Reynolds and Kathleen Turner had a feud during filming, which made the time even more unbearable for Reeve. Reeve later stated {{that he made a}} fool of himself in the film and that most of his time was spent refereeing between Reynolds and Turner. The film did poorly, and Reeve believed that it marked the end of his movie star career. He spent the next years mostly doing plays. He tried out for the Richard Gere role in Pretty Woman but walked out on the audition <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> half-hearted casting director fill in for Julia Roberts.|$|E

In the four first-class matches that he was picked in, {{two of them in}} the Sheffield Shield, it was as a middle order batsman. He made the most of his chance in a match against Tasmania at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1926/27 when he scored 220 of Victoria's 552 first innings runs. Mitchell then dismissed Tasmanian Alfred Watson twice with the ball and also took three catches to round off a good all round performance. His only other wicket at first-class level had come on his debut against New Zealand and was All Blacks rugby player Charlie Oliver. Despite Mitchell's efforts in the Tasmania match, he wasn't picked for Victoria ever again.|$|E
25|$|Linda Dugeau and Dot Robinson co-founded Motor Maids with 51 {{members and}} a dream. She took {{interest}} {{in the idea of}} creating a women’s group in the 1930s and took the liberty to reach out to motorcycle dealerships, AMA clubs and fellow riders in search to find women riders who would take part in helping her form a motorcycle organization of females. Although the idea of forming a group took ten years before becoming reality it took Dugeau and her old friend Dot Robinson three of the ten years to find willing female participates to be considered as Motor Maid members. Once the organization found its standing legs the organization expanded quickly, and opportunities to showcase themselves at parades and other events approached them quickly <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> distinctive image. The Motor Maids organization became very popular throughout the United States of America and president Dot Robinson and secretary Linda Dugeau were ecstatic with the movement they were creating.|$|E
25|$|As Air Canada had {{employed}} a scorched earth policy {{to prevent the}} Onex proposed acquisition {{as one of its}} lines of defence, they had burdened themselves with onerous contracts with virtually all of their suppliers. As a result, on 1 April 2003, Air Canada filed for protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act; they emerged from this protection on 30 September 2004, 18 months later. During the period of bankruptcy protection, the company was subject to two competing bids from Cerberus Capital Management and Victor Li. The Cerberus bid would have seen former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney installed as chairman, being recruited by Cerberus' international advisory board chair Dan Quayle, the former Vice-President of the United States. Cerberus was rejected <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> reputation of changing existing employee pension agreements, a move strongly opposed by the CAW. At first, Air Canada selected Victor Li's Trinity Time Investments, which initially asked for a board veto and the chairmanship in return for investing $650 million in the airline. Li, who holds dual citizenship from Canada and Hong Kong, later demanded changes to the pension plan (which was not in his original takeover bid), but since the unions refused to budge, the bid was withdrawn.|$|E

25|$|In 1884, England had a {{disagreement}} with Scotland over a try that England had scored {{but that the}} referee disallowed citing a foul by Scotland. England argued that the referee should have played advantage and that, as they made the Law, if {{they said it was}} a try then it was. The International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) was formed by Scotland, Ireland and Wales in 1886; but England refused to join, since they believed that they should have greater representation on the board <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> greater number of clubs. They also refused to accept that the IRFB should be the recognised law maker of the game. The IRFB agreed that the member countries would not play England until the RFU agreed to join and accept that the IRFB would oversee the games between the home unions. England finally agreed to join in 1890. In 1930, it was agreed between the members that all future matches would be played under the laws of the IRFB. In 1997, the IRFB moved its headquarters from London to Dublin and a year later it changed its name to the International Rugby Board (IRB); in 2014, it changed its name again to the current World Rugby (WR).|$|E
25|$|The Phillies were 36-45 and 11 {{games behind}} {{the first place}} Nationals after their series against the Marlins. The Phillies started the month by taking 1 of 3 from the New York Mets. The one win, however, came with Cliff Lee finally winning his {{first game of the}} season after 13 starts. The streak tied for 5th for the longest winless streak for a pitcher. The Phillies would end the first half by getting swept by the Atlanta Braves. They ended the first half with a {{disastrous}} 37–50 mark, their worst since 1997. The Phillies seemed to have woken up in the second half, as they would take 2 of 3 from the Colorado Rockies and Los Angeles Dodgers. Although they only took 1 of 3 from the San Francisco Giants, they would make it up by sweeping the Milwaukee Brewers, all from late comebacks. The sweep was their first 3-game sweep of the year. The sweep, however, got taken back by the Braves as they would get swept by them again <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> hard time with runners in scoring position. The sweep woke up the Phillies, as they would blow out the Washington Nationals in the 1st game of the series on July 31, 8–0. The Phillies would end up taking 2 of 3 from the Nationals. After the series against the Nationals on August 2, the Phillies were 47–58, 15 and a half games behind the first place Nationals, and 13 game behind the second wild card. Although their playoff chances are slim, the Phillies performance after the all-star break looked promising for next season. Throughout the month, knowing that they will likely not make the post-season, the Phillies made trades with some of their players. One of the trades were Hunter Pence getting traded to the Giants for Nate Schierholtz, Tommy Joseph, and Seth Rosin. Another trade was Shane Victorino getting trading to the Dodgers for 2 pitchers. Pitcher Joe Blanton also got involved in a trade with the Dodgers. The Phillies would also resign Cole Hamels to a six-year, $144 million extension, the second-largest contract for a pitcher in baseball history.|$|E
