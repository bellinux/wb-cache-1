So, it was really like, what's the bass line gonna sound like? Is it gonna be really stripped down and sparse, or {{is it going to be}} loaded up? Is it gonna be Chicago house? Is it gonna be U.K. house? It's like, all over the place. Is it gonna be a little bit of one vocal line? Is it gonna <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> choir singing? So we were experimenting and trying out different things. They all sounded good, but at the end of the day, we wanted it to sound timeless, also. Not just something of the moment.|$|E

This book is {{revealed to be}} the eleventh volume of an English-language encyclopedia entirely devoted to Tlön, one of the worlds in which Uqbar's legends are set. The book contains two oval blue stamps with the words Orbis Tertius inscribed in blue. From this point, part two comprehensively describes and discuss Tlön's culture, history, languages and philosophy, which form the central focus of the story as Borges reads the tome, eager to finally know about the obscure subject he sought for so long, {{which turned out to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new world alien to his own.|$|E

[...] Similarly, Orlando Parfitt of IGN (UK) praised the performances of the actors and the action scenes, but stated that the film felt underdeveloped: [...] "There's an enjoyable time to be had with Wolverine, but it's also somewhat unsatisfying." [...] Furthermore, Scott Mendelson of The Huffington Post gave the film a grade of [...] "D", noting that [...] "Wolverine was the lead character of [...] films, and we've already learned everything {{we need to know}} from the films in said franchise," [...] adding that [...] "the extra information given here actually serves to make the character of Logan/Wolverine less interesting." [...] Steven Rea also felt that the film injured the character by proving that [...] "how the hero acquired his special powers turns out to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> lot less interesting than what he does with them", while also being [...] "a mash-up of meaningless combat sequences (meaningless because Logan/Wolverine is just about unstoppable), sub-par visual effects, template backstory, and some goofy Liev Schreiber-as-a-villain thespianizing".|$|E

Wilford further stated [...] "Back in the day, there seemed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> lot of mascot-type characters in games, like Mario, Sonic, all those things, and not many devs {{seem to be doing}} that anymore.

2500|$|In 2003, after S Club disbanded, Stevens {{signed a}} £1.5million solo four-album deal with Polydor Records and re-signed with Fuller. She said that {{breaking}} {{out on her}} own after success with S Club was difficult: [...] "I think we [...] ended up conforming to what people's perceptions were. This one was the ditzy one, this one was the singer, this one was the dancer. And to come out of that and <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> person has been a real challenge for me. I didn't have my say, really, in the group. None of us did". Her first solo single, written by Cathy Dennis and produced by Bloodshy & Avant, [...] "Sweet Dreams My LA Ex", was released in September 2003. Taking inspiration from R and adult-style pop music, Stevens's debut solo album, Funky Dory, was released later that month. The album was a minor hit, reaching number 9 on the UK albums chart. Although it was not a huge commercial success, it gained praise from pop critics; Jamie Gill, in a review for Yahoo! Launch, said that Stevens [...] "eschews the cheap and cheerful approach of her old band for a slinky adult confidence and musical eclecticism." [...] That December the album's title track [...] "Funky Dory", featuring a sample of the David Bowie song [...] "Andy Warhol" [...] from his album Hunky Dory, was released as its second single and failed to match the success of [...] "Sweet Dreams My LA Ex", peaking at number twenty-four.|$|E

Jonas was finally going to be seeing his run end......The final season was going to be, I figured the fifth season was going to be the last... It was going to be a long, sort of final mission for Jonas. He's not medically cleared, Mack has to go in and sort of change the medical records so that Jonas can keep on [...] We had a whole thing planned, it was going to be good." [...] Jonas would eventually leave the army due to his injuries coupled with combat stress and reunite with Molly. Mack would take over the team but at the end of the series would also leave for a training post after Tiffy becomes pregnant with their third child. Bob would be badly injured in a parachuting accident and join the CIA as their Unit liaison. Ryan would take a demotion to regain control of The Unit whilst Bridget Sullivan would be killed on a mission halfway through the season. Charles Grey would take over as team leader with Sam McBride as his deputy training replacements for the personnel they have lost.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2008, Rush Hour {{director}} Brett Ratner {{was officially}} named director, who promised the film would return under the series' standard [...] "R" [...] rating, {{rather than as}} a rumored watered down PG-13. Michael Brandt and Derek Haas were hired as screenwriters to improve on the existing script in July 2008 and completed a new script, under the working title Beverly Hills Cop 2009, which would see Foley return to Beverly Hills to investigate the murder of his friend Billy Rosewood. The script was eventually rejected, leaving Ratner to work on a new idea. In an interview with Empire magazine, Ratner stated [...] "I'm working very hard on the fourth. It's very difficult, especially since there were three before. We're trying to figure out some important things, like where do we start? Is Axel retired? Is he in Beverly Hills? Is he on vacation? Does Judge Reinhold return as the loveable Billy Rosewood? Many questions to figure out, but I'm hoping to have a script before film disappears from our existence." [...] Although Murphy himself committed to the project, it was unconfirmed whether the series' other principal actors, Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Ronny Cox or Bronson Pinchot would also return, though Ratner stated in late 2009 {{that he was trying to}} convince Reinhold and Ashton to reprise their roles. Harold Faltermeyer's [...] "Axel F", however, would definitely be returning for the proposed fourth installment, with Ratner quoted as saying [...] "It'll be back but it'll <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new interpretation."
