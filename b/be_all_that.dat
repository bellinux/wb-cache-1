5|$|There is no {{cure for}} Tourette's and no {{medication}} that works universally for all individuals without significant adverse effects. Knowledge, education and understanding are uppermost in management plans for tic disorders. The management of the symptoms of Tourette's may include pharmacological, behavioral and psychological therapies. While pharmacological intervention is reserved for more severe symptoms, other treatments (such as supportive psychotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy) may help to avoid or ameliorate depression and social isolation, and to improve family support. Educating a patient, family, and surrounding community (such as friends, school, and church) is a key treatment strategy, and may <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> is required in mild cases.|$|E
25|$|In {{the most}} minor cases of Bennett fracture, {{there may be}} only small {{avulsion}} fractures, relatively little joint instability, and minimal subluxation of the CMC joint (less than 1mm). In such cases, closed reduction followed by immobilization in a thumb spica cast and serial radiography may <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> is required for effective treatment.|$|E

In cases that are detected later, surgery and casting may be needed. About 7.5% of hip replacements are done to treat problems which have arisen from hip dysplasia.|$|E

25|$|There are early {{hints that}} Seishirō may not <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> he appears. Hokuto jokes {{about him being}} a member of the family of Sakurazukamori, a clan of assassins who use onmyōjitsu to kill, and are {{pronounced}} to be the Sumeragis' opposite. Also, Subaru has dreams about having met someone under a cherry tree blooming out of season when he was but a small child, but he cannot quite recall what was being said. This person was actually Seishirō, upon whom Subaru stumbled when he had just performed a kill. According to the rules of the Sakurazukamori, Seishirō should have killed him, but impressed with the child's purity, he made a bet with him instead: He would meet Subaru again, and would then spend one year with him, protecting him and trying to love him. If, at the end of that year, he felt something for Subaru which distinguished him from a thing he could easily destroy, as he could not with any other person, then he would not kill him. To recognize him, he marked him with inverted pentagrams on both hands, the sign of the Sakurazukamori's prey. These marks are for most of the story hidden beneath the gloves Subaru continually wears on the direction of his grandmother, the previous family head, who recognized the marks and so hopes to conceal them with her magic.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed to fairly positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly {{staff member}} Ken Tucker called [...] "Concentrate and Ask Again" [...] {{the completion of}} a trilogy of episodes that [...] "bring together a lot of the show's mythology." [...] However, he did not believe the main plot to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> fascinating, commenting that it [...] "could have passed for an episode of Undercovers." [...] Instead, Tucker enjoyed the smaller details in the episode, such as the room full of items owned by William Bell; he also praised guest actor Omid Abtahi's [...] "marvelously anguished" [...] performance.|$|E

Cyril Alex translated into Tamil and was published in 2015, personally attended by Roy Moxham himself.|$|E

500|$|The song is a midtempo R and hip hop ballad that [...] "mixes a soft {{beat with}} piano accompaniment." [...] Its lyrics convey {{a message of}} self-worth and perseverance, with Carey urging {{listeners}} to [...] "Reach for the stars/ <b>Be</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> you are." [...] The song made little impact commercially; many felt the singer was overshadowed by the hip-hop duo, and should have had more presence on her comeback single. Two accompanying versions were released alongside the original, titled the [...] "Pulse Club" [...] and [...] "Vintage Throwback" [...] remixes. Like the reception, commercial impact has been generally low. Most critics attribute this to the song's low appeal to Top 40 formats and mainstream channels.|$|E

[...] Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette concurred, writing that it [...] "succeeds because it offers sly cultural commentary." [...] Show Patrol wrote [...] "The nostalgia factor makes “Grand Pumpkin” {{the best of these}} amusing bits for me, but they all lack that trademark “Simpsons” brand of satirical smartness." [...] Hal Boedecker of the Orlando Sentinel gave the episode a 4/5 and called the final segment a [...] "witty parody of Charlie Brown's Halloween classic.

500|$|Media {{response}} to Intimacy was generally favourable; aggregating website Metacritic reports a normalised rating of 69% based on 27critical reviews. Steven Robertshaw of Alternative Press described the album as arguably Bloc Party's finest career moment {{and noted that}} it offers [...] "sweat and circuitry, savagery and submission, and a captivating energy that's severely lacking in many music scenes on the planet". Kyle Anderson of Rolling Stone claimed that by [...] "replacing Bloc Party's distant cool with vivid honesty, Okereke makes Intimacy a confident new peak for his band", while PopMatters' Ross Langager explained that the record [...] "might not actually <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> intimate, {{but it is a}} thing of rough, recycled beauty". Adam Mazmanian of The Washington Times commented that the album's final mix showed that producers Epworth and Lee preserved the essence of Bloc Party's signature sound—"minor key rock thrumming with rhythmic intensity"—while taking the band in new musical directions. Dave Simpson of The Guardian concluded that it would please old and new fans alike by being [...] "brave, individual and heartfelt".|$|E
500|$|... "Honor to Us All" [...] has not {{particularly}} enjoyed {{a reputation as}} one of Disney's [...] "classic" [...] songs. On Billboards ranking of [...] "Every Song From the Disney Renaissance (1989–'99)", [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] was placed at number 41. Billboard music critic Andrew Unterberger described the song as [...] "too expository to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> catchy" [...] while [...] "the traditional Eastern musical influence feels well-intentioned but clumsy." [...] However, he highlighted the song's second verse as [...] "a nice touch". Bustles Kadeen Griffiths considers [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] one of [...] "14 Disney Songs You Only Know The Chorus Of" [...] despite its catchiness, selecting [...] "scarier than the undertaker, we are meeting our Matchmaker" [...] as the only lyrics she remembers. Consequence of Sound ranked [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] one of Disney's worst songs, at number 214. In a more positive opinion, The Odyssey Online ranked [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] one of [...] "The Best Disney Songs From The 90s", at number seven, while BuzzFeed ranked it the 63rd greatest animated Disney song, out of 102.|$|E
