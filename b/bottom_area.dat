25|$|In 2014, the National Trust for Historic Preservation {{recruited}} Nyong'o in {{an effort}} to oppose development, including a new minor league baseball stadium, in the Shockoe <b>Bottom</b> <b>area</b> of Richmond, Virginia. The historic neighborhood, one of Richmond's oldest, was the site of major slave-trading before the American Civil War. On October 19, 2014, Nyong'o sent a letter to Richmond Mayor Dwight C. Jones, which she posted on social media sites, asking him to withdraw support for the development proposal.|$|E

The Suitland Parkway connects the city with the southeastern suburbs in Prince George's County, Maryland. The Whitehurst Freeway, an elevated freeway over K Street in Georgetown, allows U.S. Highway 29 traffic to bypass congested Georgetown between the Key Bridge and K Street downtown. The E Street Expressway connects I-66 with the city's Foggy <b>Bottom</b> <b>area</b> and the areas immediately to the west of the White House. The Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway provides access to downtown from the northern and western ends of the city.|$|E
500|$|Bulkers have a {{cross-section}} typical of most merchant ships. The {{upper and lower}} corners of the hold are used as ballast tanks, as is the double <b>bottom</b> <b>area.</b> The corner tanks are reinforced and serve another purpose besides controlling the ship's trim. Designers choose {{the angle of the}} corner tanks to be less than that of the angle of repose of the anticipated cargoes. This greatly reduces side-to-side movement, or [...] "shifting," [...] of cargo which can endanger the ship.|$|E

2500|$|Washington, D.C., {{was created}} {{to serve as the}} {{national}} capital from its inception. The Residence Act of 1790 required that the capital's territory would be located along the Potomac River within an area that Maryland and Virginia would cede to the federal government, but permitted the nation's first president, George Washington to select the territory's precise location. President Washington then chose for the territory a square whose sides were [...] in length and whose corners were directly north, east, south and west of its center. [...] The area of the square contained the existing towns of Georgetown and Alexandria, as well as two small villages, Hamburgh in the Foggy <b>Bottom</b> <b>area</b> and Carrollsburg near the confluence of the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers.|$|E
2500|$|In 1910 {{the city}} of Hillsboro began using the Jackson <b>Bottom</b> <b>area</b> for water waste disposal. By the 1930s farmers in the {{community}} protested the water pollution that resulted from waste dumping into the river. Then in 1939 the city purchased part of the area and began {{using it as a}} sewer farm that produced a variety of produce and the city made some money off the venture. By the 1970s the city had acquired most of the land in that area, stopped using the farm, and let the area become grassland. Next, in 1980 the Jackson Bottom Coordinated Resource Management Plan was developed and the area was transformed into a wetlands area. In 1999, the wetlands received a National Wetlands Award for Education and Outreach [...] from the Environmental Law Institute. Cougar sightings in June 2014 closed trails on several occasions.|$|E
60|$|Creeping to his side, {{we looked}} over the rocks. The place into which we gazed was a pit, and may, in the early days, {{have been one of}} the smaller {{volcanic}} blow-holes of the plateau. It was bowl-shaped and at the bottom, some hundreds of yards from where we lay, were pools of green-scummed, stagnant water, fringed with bullrushes. It was a weird place in itself, but its occupants made it seem like a scene from the Seven Circles of Dante. The place was a rookery of pterodactyls. There were hundreds of them congregated within view. All the <b>bottom</b> <b>area</b> round the water-edge was alive with their young ones, and with hideous mothers brooding upon their leathery, yellowish eggs. From this crawling flapping mass of obscene reptilian life came the shocking clamor which filled the air and the mephitic, horrible, musty odor which turned us sick. But above, perched each upon its own stone, tall, gray, and withered, more like dead and dried specimens than actual living creatures, sat the horrible males, absolutely motionless save for the rolling of their red eyes or an occasional snap of their rat-trap beaks as a dragon-fly went past them. Their huge, membranous wings were closed by folding their fore-arms, so that they sat like gigantic old women, wrapped in hideous web-colored shawls, and with their ferocious heads protruding above them. Large and small, not less than a thousand of these filthy creatures lay in the hollow before us.|$|E

40|$|Past {{experience}} with crisis-driven odor investigations {{has shown that}} there is an odor impact priority ranking which is definable for virtually every malodor issue; whether from natural or synthetic source. An accurate definition of such odorant priority ranking is, in turn, critical to the development of accurate and objective instrument-based methods for odor assessment and monitoring relative to that source. This paper reports on the results-to-date relative to the Carthage <b>Bottoms</b> <b>Area</b> Odor Study; a test case undertaken by the Missouri DNR to evaluate the concept of odorant prioritization by MDGC-MS-Olfactometry. The ultimate goal {{of this study was to}} explore the utility of odorant prioritization as a first step toward the translation of sensory-only odor monitoring protocols to sensory-directed but instrument based alternatives. The Carthage <b>Bottoms</b> <b>Area</b> was selected by the Missouri DNR for this exploratory effort based upon a number of factors: including; (1) an intermittent but long-standing unresolved odor issue with respect to downwind citizenry; (2) a uniquely complex, diverse and densely co-located source industry mix within the combined Bottoms Area; (3) limited past success in point-source differentiation utilizing sensory-only protocols and (4) a past history of cooperation between citizenry, community officials, industry leaders and regulatory agencies in the exploration and implementation of technologies targeting enhanced mutually beneficial co-existance. MDGC-MS-O odorant profile and prioritization results are presented for SPME collections taken near and at-distance downwind as well as reference upwind with respect to the combined <b>Bottoms</b> <b>Area...</b>|$|R

50|$|On {{the ocean}} bottom, sand dollars are {{frequently}} found together. This {{is due in}} part to their preference for soft <b>bottom</b> <b>areas,</b> which are convenient for their reproduction. The sexes are separate and, as with most echinoids, gametes are released into the water column and are conceived by external fertilization. The nektonic larvae metamorphose through several stages before the skeleton or test begins to form, at which point they become benthic.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Flanging is {{a method}} of sheet metal forming process under {{combined}} compressive and tensile conditions using a punch and die to raise closed rims (flanges or collars) on pierced holes. For the flanging product used for the automotive steering part, {{the thickness of the}} <b>bottom</b> radius <b>area</b> is very important because of the crack usually occurred during the using process. But during conventional flanging process, the thickness of the rim and the <b>bottom</b> radius <b>area</b> were decreased seriously and make the hole flanging not strong enough to be used. In order to increase the thickness of <b>bottom</b> radius <b>area</b> of the flanging wall, a new method that combines flanging process and cold forging process was proposed in this paper and a special forming die set was designed with a stripper subjected to counter-pressure with an aim to obtain a more substantial flange. FEM software DEFORM 3 D was employed to simulate these flanging part forming processes. The results showed the thickness of <b>bottom</b> radius <b>area</b> of the flanging wall was increased and a more substantial flange was obtained...|$|R

40|$|Creel and trawl {{surveys of}} Biscayne Bay {{were carried out}} in 1982 - 1983 to assess {{commercial}} fish and macro-invertebrate habitats and fisheries. Dredged and/or barren bottom was dramatically less productive than seagrass, algae or hard <b>bottom</b> <b>areas.</b> Low fish abundance and diversity in north Biscayne Bay appeared to be correlated with high turbidity and low seagrass abundance. Substantive increases in fish and crustacean productivity in north Biscayne Bay will occur only if seagrass communities can be re-established. Deeper dredged areas in North Bay will not likely become recolonized with seagrass even if turbidity levels are reduced. Hard <b>bottom</b> <b>areas</b> in South Bay are associated with high diversity of fish fauna and serve as nursery areas for several highly desirable species (e. g. hogfish, yellowtail snapper, lane snapper). The area between Julia Tuttle and 79 th Street Causeways, which had very dense seagrass abundance, was the richest area on either North or South Biscayne Bay for juvenile fish and shrimp.
