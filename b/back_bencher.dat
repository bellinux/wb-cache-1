5000|$|Only {{about one}} third of the Rump Parliament became front benchers who were {{consistently}} present and engaged in their parliamentary position. The other two thirds were <b>back</b> <b>benchers,</b> or essentially, part timers who had inconsistent attendance. Within the active third of the rump, there were many family allegiances, local allegiances and most importantly, common interest groups. The majority of active rumpers could fit into one of the two common interest categories: ...|$|R

50|$|In 2011 he was {{declared}} The Week's <b>Back</b> <b>Bencher</b> {{of the year}} based on an enquiry into Afghanistan that was highly critical of Government policy and urged the UK {{to do more to}} encourage the US to talk with the Taliban.|$|E
5000|$|Most Rumpers still {{regarded}} many purged colleagues as “members of parliament” {{and remained}} {{hopeful that the}} excluded members would be readmitted. “The Rump {{did not think of}} itself as a corporate political entity distinct in membership, aims and character from the Long Parliament”. [...] Despite the rump’s lack of distinctiveness, there were a variety of reasons why people {{wanted to be a part}} of the Rump Parliament. Some members stayed in the Rump Parliament because they genuinely supported revolutionary changes, while others were only there for financial advantage, civilian power, or to satisfy their relish for political activity. Because of the varied energies within the Rump, the parliament divided into two categories, front <b>benchers</b> and <b>back</b> <b>benchers,</b> meaning, those who attended parliament regularly and those who did not.|$|R
5000|$|Reflecting on {{this period}} in 2011 Heseltine stated that [...] "you {{would have the}} left wing, which wouldn't have any real {{interest}} in effective management of the capitalist system. And {{you would have a}} very powerful element on the right wing of politics that would think it's a matter for the capitalist system to manage itself and government intervention, as they would call it, would be very unattractive. In truth, when I did it, I did comprehensive presentations to Conservative <b>back</b> <b>benchers</b> so that they could see what I believed an industrial policy was about. What they felt it was likely to be about were things like backing winners, or subsidising losers. Now I wasn't in favour of certainly the latter, but once I had done the presentations, I had no complaints." ...|$|R
500|$|Initially, The Sydney Morning Herald {{reported}} that the final catalyst for the move on Rudd was sparked by a report that Rudd had used {{his chief of staff}} to sound out <b>back</b> <b>benchers</b> on his level of support, thus implying that [...] "he did not trust the repeated assurances by Ms Gillard that she would not stand". Later, ABC's 7:30 Report said the seeds for the challenge to Rudd came from [...] "factional heavyweights" [...] Bill Shorten and Senator David Feeney, who secured the support of [...] "New South Wales right power broker" [...] Mark Arbib and that Feeney and Arbib went to discuss a challenge with Gillard on the morning of 23 June and a final numbers count began for a challenge. Accounts have continued to differ as to the extent of Gillard's foreknowledge and planning of the replacement of Rudd.|$|R
50|$|Whiteside {{was elected}} to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in the 1913 Alberta general {{election}} defeating Conservative candidate and future MLA William Wallace Wilson. He served 1 term in the Alberta Legislature as a <b>back</b> <b>bencher</b> in the Liberal government.|$|E

50|$|At {{home that}} night, after missing his train because {{he walked to}} the station, Hacker informs his wife, Annie, of his {{personal}} economy drive. She can't quite believe that after 20 years of struggling for his position, he is no better off than he was as a <b>back</b> <b>bencher.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of life peers in 1958 represented the 20 th century's most {{significant change in}} the composition of the house of lords, until the removal of (most) hereditary peers in 1999. Yet the 1958 reform was introduced by a Conservative government which was under no discernible pressure to do so, least of all by its own <b>back</b> <b>benchers.</b> Yet the Conservative leadership in both houses of parliament decided to seize the initiative on house of lords reform, partly to enable the house of lords to discharge its political responsibilities more effectively, thereby preventing it from atrophying, and partly to pre-empt more extreme reform by a future Labour government. Yet having agreed to undertake such a reform, senior Conservatives encountered a range of often unforeseen constitutional and political problems, which ensured that the final reform was actually rather less comprehensive than many ministers had originally envisaged...|$|R
5000|$|In August 1983 {{there had}} been {{controversy}} over claims by Allen {{that he had been}} attacked while walking through the city at night. It was reported he had diabetes, and some concluded he may have been hallucinating or was intoxicated. A detailed account of the Keith Allen affair is provided by Sir Robert Muldoon in his book [...] "Number 8" [...] on page 154. In it he discusses the intrigues surrounding Allen's claim that he had been assaulted, the media fracas and a leaked medical report. What Muldoon doesn't state is that Allen was finding the job of a cabinet minister stressful and wanted to resign. Muldoon would not accept his resignation, according to Barry Gustafson in his biography on Muldoon entitled [...] "His Way". In the documentary [...] "Muldoon: The Grim Face of Power" [...] reference is made to these events. It is claimed that National's Senior Whip Don McKinnon met Muldoon on Keith Allen's behalf to explain that Allen wanted out of the Cabinet and wished to retire at the next election. Muldoon retorted: [...] "You look after the <b>back</b> <b>benchers</b> and I'll look after the Ministers. You keep away from Keith Allen".|$|R
50|$|John {{was first}} elected as an {{original}} member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta for the electoral district of Stony Plain in the Alberta general election, 1905 for the Alberta Liberal Party defeating Dan Bronx of the Conservatives and future Conservative MLA Conrad Weidenhammer who ran as an Independent. He served the Alberta Liberal Party as a <b>back</b> <b>bencher.</b>|$|E
50|$|Scanlen {{was not an}} {{outstanding}} politician. He had a good legal brain, was a conscientious worker and a good <b>back</b> <b>bencher,</b> but he was neither a good orator nor a leader. It was his misfortune that, in assuming the Premiership, he also inherited Sprigg's legacy of intractable problems. In private life, Scanlen was modest and retiring. He was a difficult conversationalist, having virtually no small talk, but he possessed a dry sense of humour and was a shrewd judge of character.|$|E
50|$|Following Gillard's {{selection}} as Labor leader in June 2010, the First Gillard Ministry {{did not differ}} markedly {{from that of the}} predecessor Rudd Government, although former Prime Minister Rudd became a <b>back</b> <b>bencher</b> and Treasurer Swan became Deputy Prime Minister. Gillard promised to restore Rudd to the ministry if Labor was to win the next election. Gillard allocated her former responsibilities of Education, Workplace Relations and Social Inclusion to veteran minister Simon Crean. Stephen Smith remained as Foreign Minister, but also assumed Crean's Trade portfolio.|$|E
5000|$|What {{began as}} a bill drafted by little known Luton South Conservative <b>back</b> <b>bencher</b> Graham Bright was made law after he and the tabloid press (most notably The Daily Mail) had {{successfully}} whipped the media into a frenzied hysteria over so-called [...] "video nasties". [...] "Ban the Sadist Videos!" [...] {{was one of the}} more famous headlines they ran. When the bill was made law it became a legal requirement that all videotapes must be submitted to the BBFC for classification and possible cuts.|$|E
50|$|MacKay {{ran for the}} Legislative Assembly of Alberta for {{the first}} time in the 1913 Alberta general {{election}} resigning his Ontario Legislature seat as soon as the writ was dropped. MacKay ran in the Edmonton electoral district and was defeated finishing a very close 3rd place in the block vote. After his defeat he then ran as the candidate in the deferred Athabasca election on July 30, 1913. In his second attempt at office he defeated Conservative candidate Mayor of Athabasca James Wood by a comfortable margin to win his first term in office. MacKay spent his first term in the Legislature as a <b>back</b> <b>bencher</b> for the government.|$|E
5000|$|After the Ballot (Original French title: [...] Chers électeurs) is a {{documentary}} film by Manuel Foglia, {{produced by the}} National Film Board of Canada. The film was released in 2008. It follows the lives of {{two members of the}} National Assembly of Québec - Charlotte L'Écuyer, a Liberal <b>back</b> <b>bencher,</b> and Daniel Turp, a Parti Québécois (PQ) Shadow Minister. The film follows L'Écuyer and her troubles with her own government. She wants to preserve her riding's lumbering jobs, although her government, insofar as it is presented in the film, is committed to preserving forests. Turp, on the hand, {{does not seem to have}} the same constituency problems. Here, the film focuses on his reaction to various political actions undertaken by the PQ, and his considering running for PQ leadership.|$|E
5000|$|The New York City club is at East 60th Street, {{the site}} of the former Scores gentlemen's club. On March 26, 2009 it was {{reported}} that the club had invited Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and his wife, Thérèse Rein, to attend a private dinner whilst on his visit to the US. The Prime Minister's office {{declined to comment on the}} invitation. This followed the report that he had visited Scores in September 2003 with New York Post editor Col Allan and Labor <b>back</b> <b>bencher</b> Warren Snowdon. At the time, Rudd was the Opposition Foreign Affairs spokesman and did not have a [...] "completely clear recollection" [...] of the visit, stating he had [...] "drunk a fair bit". The revelation did not have an adverse effect on his standing in the opinion polls but he distanced himself from the event none-the-less.|$|E
50|$|The Government's {{numbers in}} the House of Representatives were {{affected}} by the resignation of Peter Slipper from the Liberal National Party in order that he {{could serve as a}} Labor aligned independent and as Speaker of the House of Representatives; {{as well as by the}} eventual suspension of Labor <b>back</b> <b>bencher</b> Craig Thomson from the ALP, who was long the subject of allegations of fraudulent conduct during the Health Services Union expenses affair. Slipper ultimately resigned as Speaker for inappropriate conduct and returned to the cross bench, while police investigations were ongoing in relation to Thomson. Extensive allegations were brought before Fair Work Australia (FWA), concerning mis-use of union funds during his time as a leader of the Labor affiliated Health Services Union (HSU), prior to his entry to Parliament. Thomson pleaded not guilty to 145 charges of theft and deception relating to the alleged misuse of Union funds following the 2013 Federal Election, but was found guilty on multiple counts.|$|E
5000|$|An {{assessment}} {{of the performance of}} each MSP by The Herald newspaper published in the middle of December 1999 noted that Welsh was only on leave of absence from being Chief Executive of Kilmarnock F.C., and said that he was [...] "clearly finding the transition to 'humble' <b>back</b> <b>bencher</b> a bit hard". A week later, Welsh suddenly resigned his seat, explaining that the decision came after [...] "considerable heart searching and extended family debate". After press speculation that he was disappointed not to have achieved high office, Welsh wrote an article explaining that as a council leader he delivered [...] "real service to constituents, rather than the threadbare and raddled soundbites of politicians who promise everything and deliver nothing". At 230 days after election, he was the first MSP to resign from the job. The subsequent by-election was won by John Scott for the Conservatives, gaining the party their first ever constituency seat in the Scottish Parliament.|$|E
50|$|In May 2014, Sarawak Report {{began to}} allege that 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) was backing Jho Low's company, Wynton Group, for {{a bid to}} {{purchase}} Maybourne Hotel Group in London. In August 2014, Red Granite Pictures admitted that its financial backer for film production was Aabar Investments where the latter had a strong investment ties with 1MDB. In March 2015, the website ran several reports about a strategic development fund supported by the Malaysian government and its business dealings. One such report was made about joint venture deal had been initiated by Jho Low on 8 September 2009 between 1MDB and PetroSaudi International, and how Jho Low allegedly siphoned off US$700 million from the deal into an account controlled by him. PetroSaudi has denied the reports, while 1MDB has denied any connections with Jho Low. Sarawak Report further alleges that the 1 billion loan paid by 1MDB to PetroSaudi has not been declared to Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), the Malaysian central bank. 1MDB was also accused of providing false documents to Malaysian central bank and other international banks. The website also alleged that US$1.16 billion from 1MDB went into a company account, Good Star Limited controlled by Jho Low, US$700 million into the private AmBank account of Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak, and RM 2 million into prime minister's wife Rosmah Mansor personal account. Jho Low was also accused of paying for Rosmah's jewellery purchases. Najib has since denied {{that he had taken}} 1MDB funds for personal gain while Rosmah denied that she has misappropriated the funds from 1MDB. On 4 August 2015, Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) announced that the US$700 million was a political donation for United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) held in trust by Najib Razak. On 15 August 2015, Sarawak Report alleged that after the 2013 Malaysian General Election, US$650 million out of US$700 million in Najib's account was transferred back to Tanore Finance Corporation (BVI) at Falcon bank in Singapore when his account was closed on 30 August 2013. Tanore Corporation was later closed down in April 2014. The website also alleged that UMNO <b>Back</b> <b>Bencher</b> Chairman Shahrir Abdul Samad, received RM1 million while the Deputy Finance Minister Ahmad Maslan, received RM2 million from the Najib's private account.|$|E
