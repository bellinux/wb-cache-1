50|$|<b>Belian</b> {{is an old}} Javanese {{word for}} a dukun who has died and taken {{the form of a}} tiger spirit. This stage focuses on spiritual and {{internal}} training. With the rise of Islamic conservatism in Southeast Asia today, esoteric aspects of silat are either downplayed or re-interpreted to fit into modern religious thought. However, the traditional seni <b>belian</b> is based more strongly on indigenous Indonesian kejawen rather than the Muslim faith.|$|E

50|$|When {{the plans}} of the New Zealand {{architect}} BW Mountfort were unveiled, Elton was hugely involved in choosing the materials. The use of Eusideroxylon zwageri (Bornean <b>belian</b> wood) would dramatically increase the cost of construction, while the usage of bricks was {{not considered to be}} cosmetically pleasing, so they finally agreed on a building made of stone blocks, specifically granite. While the white stones that adorn the windows and doors were imported from Hong Kong, the darker stones came from a quarry near Kampong Buli Sim Sim, where they were carved by prisoners {{at a cost of about}} 1.50 Straits dollar per cubic meter. One of the stone blocks is 30 cm in length and weighed about 63 kilograms.|$|E
5000|$|Eusideroxylon is a genus of {{evergreen}} trees {{belonging to}} the Lauraceae family. The genus is possibly monotypic; it includes one accepted species (E. zwageri) {{and one that is}} [...] "unresolved" [...] (E. melagangai). It is present in coastal and montane rainforests of Southeast Asia, and in laurel forest habitat. Eusideroxylon are hardwood trees reaching up to 50 metres in height with trunks over 2 m in diameter, producing commercially valuable timber. The wood of E. zwageri (Borneo Ironwood or <b>Belian)</b> is impervious to termites, and can last up to 100 years after being cut. Due to extensive logging, it is listed as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List of IUCN, and conservation efforts are underway, with several countries banning imports.|$|E
5000|$|The fifth {{category}} {{consists of}} the health-related festivals to request for curing from sickness by Menjaya or Ini Andan such as in Gawai Sakit (Sickness Festival) which is held after other smaller attempts have failed to cure the sicked persons such as begama (touching), <b>belian</b> (various manang rituals), Besugi Sakit (to ask Keling for curing via magical power) and Berenong Sakit (to ask for curing by Sengalang Burong) in the ascending order. Manang is consecrated via an official ceremony called [...] "Gawai Babangun" [...] (Manang Consecration Festival). The shaman (manang) of the Iban Dayaks have various types of pelian (ritual healing ceremony) {{to be held in}} accordance with the types of sickness determined by him through his glassy stone to see the whereabouts of the soul of the sick person. Besides, Gawai Burung can also be used for healing certain difficult-to-cure sickness via magical power by Sengalang Burong especially nowadays after headhunting has been stopped. Other self-caring ritual ceremonies that are related to wellness and longevity are Nimang Bulu (Hair Adding Ceremony), Nimang Sukat (Destiny Ceremony) and Nimang Buloh Ayu (Life-Bamboo Ceremony).|$|E
5000|$|The Istana Lama Seri Menanti, {{is one of}} {{the famous}} {{landmarks}} in Kuala Pilah District, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia is made in part of Chengal (Penak) wood Neobalanocarpus and iron wood or <b>belian</b> wood Eusideroxylon zwageri and held together using only wooden pegs. The palace took six years to build and was completed in 1908 at a cost of $45,000.00 at that time. The design has subtle hints of Minangkabau architecture, has five levels rising to a height of sixty seven feet or approximately twenty meters high and has ninety nine columns to support the main structure. Four of the main columns of sixty seven feet are the Chengal timber that came from Bukit Pergai, Jelebu and is the central feature of the structure which holds up the apex of the palace, namely the Treasury Room. The Istana Lama was a replacement for Istana Pulih which was burned down by British soldiers. The drawings and plans for Istana Lama was detailed by Mr. Woodford (Public Works Department) based on the designs provided by two local craftsmen, Kahar and Taib.

50|$|The caves {{used since}} 500 to 900 {{years ago as}} a burial place with about 125 carved wooden coffins {{available}} inside. It was divided into three main caves, namely Agop Sawat (upper cave), Agop Lintanga (middle cave) and Agop Suriba (lower cave). The caves at Agop Sawat and Lintanga contained more than 125 ancient log coffins. All coffins inside the caves were made from <b>belian</b> (Eusideroxylon zwageri) hardwood, and decorated with carvings of buffalo head, crocodile, house lizard and snake. The carvings reflect the myths and legends of the Kinabatangan people. For example, a crocodile is related to death and the power darkness while the bugang bird, dog, rooster and deer were friends of their heroes. The coffins resemble different animals associated to the beliefs of the Orang Sungai but it has also been said that they are the coffins of the Chinese who once settled in the area as Chinese artefacts were found among the remains. It is believed that this type of funeral culture was brought by traders from Mainland China and Indochina to North Borneo, since similar wooden coffins were also discovered in these countries. Researchers assumes that about 2,000 such wooden coffins are distributed in the Kinabatangan Valley. Other sites are located in Ulu Segama, Lahad Datu and Tawau.|$|E

50|$|Some, {{typically}} the younger generations, now cultivate rice and garden vegetables but many {{rely on their}} diets of sago (starch from the sago palm), jungle fruits and their prey which usually include wild boar, barking deer, mouse deer but also snakes (especially the Reticulated Python or kemanen), monkeys, birds, frogs, monitor lizards, snails and even insects such as locusts. Since they practice 'molong', they pose little strain on the forest: they rely on it and it supplies them with all they need. They are outstanding hunters and catch their prey using a 'kelepud' or blowpipe, made from the <b>Belian</b> Tree (superb timber) and carved out with unbelievable accuracy using a bone drill - the wood is not split, as it is elsewhere, so the bore has to be precise almost to the millimetre, even over a distance of 3 metres. The darts are made from the sago palm and tipped with poisonous latex of a tree (called the Tajem tree) found in the forest which can kill a human {{in a matter of}} minutes. Everything that is caught is shared as the Penan have a highly tolerant, generous and egalitarian society, so much so that it is said that the nomadic Penan have no word for 'thank you' because help is assumed and therefore doesn't require a 'thank you'. However, 'jian kenin' 'feel good' is typically used in settled communities, as a kind of equivalent to 'thank you'.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} promote the use of {{indigenous}} hardwoods in construction in Malaysia the Malaysian Timber Industry Board (MTIB) commissioned a large-scale timber structure in Johor, designed by a local architect. The building is an exhibition hall with a floor area of 4, 686 m and {{the form of the}} building is defined by three shell-shaped halls each comprised of 39 glue-laminated arches. Each arch is constructed from seven glue-laminated Keruing (Diptercarpaceae) elements connected by bonded-in steel rods using Rotafix thixotropic epoxy adhesive. The structure is supported on a raised concrete foundation and the moment-resisting framework is clad in 12 mm Malaysian marine ply attached to rolled zinc sheet onto which is fixed <b>Belian</b> (Eusideroxylon zwageri) shingles from Sarawak. Glue-laminated timber (glulam) was manufactured close to the construction site using PRF adhesive and the glulam elements were assembled partially in the factory and partially on site using double-ended galvanised steel rods with 15 mm solid steel plate separators. The bonded-in construction technique allowed connections to be hidden and assembly to proceed rapidly on site.

Over exploitation of natural stocks {{because of high}} demand and the deteriorating environmental conditions have resulted in marked decline of mahseers in the wild. Malaysian mahseers, T. tambroides (Bleeker) and T. douronensis (Valenciennes), locally known as empurau, kelah or <b>belian</b> and semah, respectively, have significant cultural and economic importance but both species are now threatened in the wild because of environmental degradation and over fishing. A captive breeding programme was instigated to attempt to propagate these two species artificially for conservation and aquaculture purposes. Both pond-reared and tank-held T. tambroides and T. douronensis reached sexual maturity in captivity and were successfully induced to spawn using hormone treatments. Ovaprim (0. 5 mL kg − 1) was the most successful hormone treatment for both species. Pre-treatment of fish with Ovaplant (28 – 68 μg kg − 1, 2 – 7 weeks before spawning induction) greatly improved the success rate of spawning induction. Repeat spawning (within 4 months of initial spawning) was induced in some captive fish. Use of formalin baths improved hatching by preventing fungal infections.

40|$|An {{experimental}} and modeling {{study was conducted}} to assess how chemical mechanism evaluations using environmental chamber data are affected by the light source and other chamber characteristics. Xenon arc light lights appear to give the best artificial representation of sunlight currently available, and experiments were conducted in a new Teflon chamber constructed using such a light source. Experiments were also conducted in an Outdoor Teflon Chamber using new procedures to improve the light characterization, and in Teflon chambers using blacklights. These results, and results of previous runs other chambers, were compared with model predictions using an updated detailed chemical mechanism. The magnitude of the chamber radical source assumed when modeling the previous runs were found to be too high; this has implications in previous mechanism evaluations. Temperature dependencies of chamber effects can explain temperature dependencies in chamber experiments when T~ 300 K, but not at temperatures below that. The model performance had no consistent dependence on light source for experiments not containing aromatics, but the model tended to underpredict O 3 in the new xenon arc and blacklight chamber runs. This is despite the fact that such biases are not seen in modeling runs in the older xenon arc chamber or in preliminary modeling of University of North Carolina outdoor chamber runs. The reasons for this are not clear, and additional studies are planned as part of our ongoing program. iii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors wish to acknowledge and thank Mr Bart Croes of the CARB, Mr. Tim <b>Belian</b> of the CRC, Dr. Alan Lloyd of the SCAQMD, Mr. Brent Bailey of NREL, {{and the members of the}} CRC/APRAC reactivity committee for their support of this project and their patience with the [...] ...|$|E
