2500|$|During an {{appearance}} on CNN's American Morning, former CBS anchor Walter Cronkite said about Rather: [...] "It surprised {{quite a few people}} at CBS and elsewhere that, without being able to pull up the ratings beyond third in a three-man field, that they tolerated his being there for so long." [...] Cronkite also stated that <b>Bob</b> <b>Schieffer's</b> succession was long overdue.|$|R
5000|$|Schieffer {{was born}} on February 25, 1937, in Austin, Texas, to John Emmitt Schieffer and Gladys Payne Schieffer, {{and grew up in}} Fort Worth, Texas. He is an alumnus of North Side High School, and [...] Texas Christian University (TCU), where {{he was a member of}} the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps and the Phi Delta Theta fraternity.

25|$|October 15: The {{third and}} final presidential debate was hosted at Hofstra University. It focused on {{domestic}} and economic policy. Like the first presidential debate, it was formatted into segments, with moderator <b>Bob</b> <b>Schieffer</b> introducing the topics.|$|E

25|$|Anthony Mason became interim anchor {{effective}} June 19. Unlike when <b>Bob</b> <b>Schieffer</b> {{served as}} interim anchor from 2005 to 2006, Mason's name {{was not on}} the title of the program; it was just known as the CBS Evening News. Mason will continue with CBS News as a Senior National Correspondent and co-anchor of CBS This Morning Saturday, once Jeff Glor takes the broadcast over in late 2017.|$|E
50|$|Schieffer {{has written}} three books about {{his career in}} journalism: Face the Nation: My Favorite Stories from the First 50 Years of the Award-Winning News Broadcast, This Just In: What I Couldn't Tell You on TV, and <b>Bob</b> <b>Schieffer's</b> America. He co-authored a book about Ronald Reagan, The Acting President, with Gary Paul Gates, that was {{published}} in 1989. In his memoir, This Just In, Schieffer credits the fact he was a beat reporter at CBS for his longevity at the network.|$|R
25|$|Schieffer led the CBS Evening News {{to become}} the #2 evening news broadcast, ahead of ABC's World News Tonight. The death of anchor Peter Jennings in 2005 coupled with the {{adoption}} of a dual-anchor format on World News Tonight and life-threatening injuries suffered by Bob Woodruff when an Iraqi military convoy he rode in hit a road-side bomb, leaving Elizabeth Vargas as sole anchor, in January 2006 put the ABC News division in flux. When Charles Gibson was appointed as anchor of World News Tonight, ABC regained stability and momentum to regain the #2 spot. <b>Bob</b> <b>Schieffer's</b> final broadcast of the CBS Evening News occurred on August 31, 2006. Russ Mitchell filled in for the following two nights (September 1 and 4), after which he was succeeded on September 5 by Katie Couric.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bob</b> Lloyd <b>Schieffer</b> (born February 25, 1937) is an American {{television}} journalist. He {{is known}} for his moderation of presidential debates, where he has been praised for his capability. Schieffer {{is one of the few}} journalists to have covered all four of the major Washington national assignments: the White House, the Pentagon, United States Department of State, and United States Congress. His career with CBS has almost exclusively dealt with national politics. He has interviewed every United States President since Richard Nixon, as well as most of those who sought the office.|$|R
25|$|CBS heavily {{promoted}} Couric's {{arrival at}} the network, hoping to revive the evening news format, but there were suggestions that it backfired. Although there was much interest during her first week as anchor, CBS Evening News remained a distant third in viewership, behind ABC World News and NBC Nightly News. While Couric's ratings improved over her predecessor, <b>Bob</b> <b>Schieffer,</b> ABC's Charles Gibson widened World News' lead over Evening News.|$|E
25|$|CBS Evening News is the {{flagship}} evening television news program of CBS News, the news {{division of the}} CBS television network in the United States. The program has been broadcast since May 3, 1948 under the original title CBS Television News, eventually adopting its current title in 1963. The program is soon to be anchored by Jeff Glor. Previous anchors have included Douglas Edwards, Walter Cronkite, Dan Rather, Connie Chung, <b>Bob</b> <b>Schieffer,</b> Katie Couric, Scott Pelley and Anthony Mason.|$|E
25|$|Rather {{retired as}} the anchorman and Managing Editor of the CBS Evening News in 2005; his last {{broadcast}} was Wednesday, March 9, 2005. He {{had worked as}} the anchorman for 24 full years, the longest tenure of anyone in American television history, and {{for a short time}} continued to work as a correspondent for 60 Minutes. <b>Bob</b> <b>Schieffer,</b> a fellow Texan and host of Face the Nation, took over Rather's position on an interim basis, with Katie Couric replacing Schieffer in 2006.|$|E
25|$|ABC's World News Tonight {{remained}} {{second in}} the Nielsen Media Research rankings, though it had lost some ground to NBC's first-place Nightly News, anchored by Brian Williams. <b>Bob</b> <b>Schieffer</b> on CBS Evening News also closed the gap with ABC after Woodruff's injury. On 23 May 2006, Vargas announced her resignation from WNT, citing her doctors' recommendation to cut back her schedule considerably due to her upcoming maternity leave, and her wish {{to spend more time}} with her new baby. Gibson was then named sole anchor of the show, effective 29 May 2006.|$|E
25|$|On March 10, 2005, Rather was succeeded on {{an interim}} basis by Face the Nation host and CBS News {{correspondent}} <b>Bob</b> <b>Schieffer.</b> At the time Schieffer took over, it was uncertain {{how long he}} would host the broadcast, whether it would retain its current structure, or instead adopt some kind of multiple host or alternative format. Under Rather in the {{years leading up to}} his retirement, the CBS Evening News trailed its rivals at ABC and NBC by a fairly large margin. White House correspondent John Roberts, and Scott Pelley, his predecessor in that position, were often mentioned as possible successors to Rather when he retired. Jim Axelrod became White House correspondent when Roberts later left for CNN.|$|E
25|$|While Rather had {{inherited}} Cronkite's ratings lead, {{the success of}} the Evening News with Rather at the helm fluctuated wildly. After a dip to second place, Rather regained the top spot in 1985 until 1989 when he ceded the ratings peak to rival Peter Jennings at ABC's World News Tonight. By 1992, however, the Evening News had fallen to third place where it remained until <b>Bob</b> <b>Schieffer</b> who acted as the interim anchor between Rather and Katie Couric saw the Evening News rise to #2 ahead of ABC World News Tonight {{in the wake of the}} death of Peter Jennings but remaining behind NBC Nightly News. Rather has been a frequent collaborator with CBS News producer Susan Zirinsky, who was producer of the news while he was a reporter and anchor.|$|E
25|$|The station's news {{broadcasts}} – which originally aired only in {{the evening}} until the launch of a midday newscast in 1972 – began implementing a hosted format in 1967, when <b>Bob</b> <b>Schieffer</b> and Russ Bloxom joined the station as anchors for The Texas News, appearing on camera ahead of and after the newsreel segments. The program officially converted to a live-on-tape broadcast on August 1, 1969. Concurrent with the station's move to The Studios at DFW, KXAS donated its collection of news footage shot for The Texas News from the 1950s through the 1970s to the University of North Texas Libraries in Denton in November 2013; the film reels and accompanying script images were digitized by the university for availability to the public via the library's digital preservation network.|$|E
25|$|On June 16, 1966, Channel 5 {{became the}} first {{television}} station in Texas to present all of its news film footage in color. In 1967, Fort Worth native <b>Bob</b> <b>Schieffer</b> began his broadcast career at WBAP-TV as a reporter and anchor of the station's 10:00p.m. newscast. After leaving the station in 1971, Schieffer went on to Washington, D.C. {{to work as a}} reporter for independent station WTTG (now a Fox owned-and-operated station) and the now-defunct Metromedia news service, then embarked on a long career with CBS News that lasted until his retirement from full-time broadcasting in August 2015 and continued thereafter in a contributing role. In February 1970, WBAP-TV debuted the first locally produced television newsmagazine, Texas '70s, a monthly half-hour program showcasing feature reports focusing on the culture of Texas.|$|E
500|$|Journalism {{and media}} {{commentators}} who appear and are interviewed {{in the film}} include author Howard Zinn; Len Downie, (executive editor of The Washington Post); <b>Bob</b> <b>Schieffer</b> (CBS News); Robert McHenry (former chief of Encyclopædia Britannica); James Woolsey (former director of the Central Intelligence Agency); Chris Wilson (reporter for Slate Magazine); Cade Metz (reporter for The Register who has written critically about Wikipedia); Richard Branson and Noam Chomsky. The film documents an initiative in India and Africa called [...] "Wikipedia Academies". Controversies discussed in the film include the Essjay controversy, where a member of Wikipedia made false assertions about his academic background; and the Wikipedia biography controversy, where false statements were inserted into the Wikipedia entry for journalist John Seigenthaler. Musician KRS-One comments about the site after reading his biography on Wikipedia: [...] "I can say to you, these are the facts {{but they are not}} true." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 29, 2008, Clark made {{comments}} on Face the Nation that were critical of Republican John McCain, {{calling into question}} the notion that McCain's military service alone had given him experience relevant to being president. [...] "I certainly honor [...] service as a prisoner of war", Clark said, [...] "but he hasn't held executive responsibility. That large squadron in the Navy that he commanded—it wasn't a wartime squadron. He hasn't been in there and ordered the bombs to fall." [...] When moderator <b>Bob</b> <b>Schieffer</b> noted that Obama had no military experience to prepare him for the presidency nor had he [...] "ridden in a fighter plane and gotten shot down", Clark responded that, ultimately, Obama had not based his presidential bid on his military experience, as McCain has done throughout his campaign. Clark's retort, however, is what drew rebuke. In referring to McCain's military experience, he stated: [...] "Well, I don't think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president." [...] Both the McCain and Obama campaigns subsequently released statements rejecting Clark's comment. However, Clark has received the backing of several prominent liberal groups such as MoveOn.org and military veteran groups such as VoteVets.org; Obama ultimately stated that Clark's comments were [...] "inartful" [...] and were not intended to attack McCain's military service. In the days following the controversial interview, Clark went on several news programs to reiterate his true admiration and heartfelt support for McCain's military service as a fellow veteran who had been wounded in combat. In each program, Clark reminded the commentator and the viewing public that while he honors McCain's service, he has serious concerns about McCain's judgment in matters of national security policy, calling McCain [...] "untested and untried".|$|E

2500|$|At CBS-TV, <b>Bob</b> <b>Schieffer</b> {{took over}} the anchor chair at CBS Evening News on an interim basis.

And I am not just speaking as a father here, though I am a pretty angry father.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In a scene {{shot at the}} Library of Congress in Washington,D.C., the {{production}} employed the presence of several real-world journalists amongst the extras in {{a scene in which}} Wright-Penn's character makes a statement to the press. The group included Bob Woodward, Margaret Carlson, <b>Bob</b> <b>Schieffer,</b> John Palmer, E. J. Dionne, Katty Kay, and Steven Clemons. Additionally featured are cameos by real-life news media commentators Lou Dobbs of CNN and Chris Matthews of MSNBC. [...] Long-time Washington,DC area sportscaster Frank Herzog also has a non-speaking cameo as a congressman present at the PointCorp hearings.

2500|$|CBS News journalist, <b>Bob</b> <b>Schieffer,</b> {{asked about}} the {{allegations}} on Imus in the Morning, stating, [...] "I believe that's a story {{that we will be}} avoiding, because it appears to me that there's absolutely nothing to it ... This seems to be just sort of a staple of modern campaigns, that you got through at least one love child, which turns out not to be a love child. And I think we can all do better than this one." [...] Mickey Kaus, a journalist at Slate, speculated that the lack of mainstream coverage was motivated by a desire not to harm Elizabeth Edwards, who was fighting cancer at the time. Kaus also considered the possibility of news organizations taking a [...] "wait-and-see" [...] attitude, pending the results of the Iowa caucuses.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his book}} This Just In: What I Couldn't Tell You on TV, CBS News {{correspondent}} <b>Bob</b> <b>Schieffer,</b> who was {{serving as a}} reporter for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram when Cronkite's editorial aired, acknowledged that Johnson did not see the original broadcast but also defended the allegation that Johnson had made the remark. According to Schieffer, Johnson's aide George Christian [...] "told me that the President apparently saw some clips of it the next day" [...] and that [...] "That's when he made the remark about Cronkite. But he knew then that it would take more than Americans were willing to give it." [...] When asked about the remark during a 1979 interview, Christian claimed he had no recollection about what the President had said. In his 1996 memoir A Reporter's Life, Cronkite claimed he was at first unsure about how much of an impact his editorial report had on Johnson's decision to drop his bid for re-election, and what eventually convinced him that the President had made the statement was Bill Moyers, fellow journalist and former aide to Johnson, telling him [...] "The president flipped off the set and said 'If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost Middle America.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Jones was {{scheduled}} to perform his final concert at the Bridgestone Arena on November 22, 2013. However, on April 18, 2013, Jones was taken to VUMC for a slight fever and irregular blood pressure. His concerts in Alabama and Salem were postponed as a result. Following six days in intensive care at VUMC, Jones died on April 26, 2013; he was 81 years old. [...] Former first lady Laura Bush was among those eulogizing Jones at his funeral on May 2, 2013. Other speakers were Tennessee governor Bill Haslam, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, news personality <b>Bob</b> <b>Schieffer,</b> and country singers Barbara Mandrell and Kenny Chesney. Alan Jackson, Kid Rock, Ronnie Milsap, Randy Travis, Vince Gill, Patty Loveless, Travis Tritt, the Oak Ridge Boys, Charlie Daniels, Wynonna and Brad Paisley provided musical tributes. [...] The service was broadcast live on CMT, GAC, RFD-TV, The Nashville Network and Family Net as well as Nashville stations. SiriusXM and WSM 650AM, home of the Grand Ole Opry, broadcast the event on the radio. [...] The family requested that contributions {{be made to the}} Grand Ole Opry Trust Fund or to the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has also}} been {{reported}} that Johnson decided to wind down his re-election bid after popular and influential CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite turned against the president's policy in Vietnam and recommended peace negotiations during a CBS News editorial which aired on February 27. [...] After later watching Cronkite's editorial, Johnson allegedly exclaimed [...] "if I've lost Cronkite, I've lost Middle America." [...] Issues surrounding reports of this allegation have raised questions about its accuracy, such {{as the fact that}} Johnson was attending Texas Governor John Connally's birthday gala in Austin, Texas, when Cronkite's editorial aired and thus was unable to see the original broadcast. [...] However, Cronkite and CBS News correspondent <b>Bob</b> <b>Schieffer</b> defended reports that the remark had been made and claimed that members of Johnson's inner circle who had watched the editorial with the president, including presidential aide George Christian and journalist Bill Moyers, were able to confirm its accuracy to them at a later time. Schieffer, who was serving as a reporter for the Star-Telegrams WBAP television station in Fort Worth, Texas, when Cronkite's editorial aired, acknowledged reports that the president saw the editorial's original broadcast were inaccurate, but claimed the president was able to watch a taping of it the morning after it aired and then made the remark.|$|E
2500|$|Gingrich has {{frequently}} criticized {{what he termed}} [...] "judicial activism" [...] and in an appearance on Face the Nation in 2011 suggested that Congress should subpoena federal judges and force them to explain themselves before Congress. When host <b>Bob</b> <b>Schieffer</b> asked how he would force federal judges to comply with congressional subpoenas, Gingrich said he would send the U.S. Capitol Police or U.S. Marshals to arrest the judges and force them to testify. Gingrich's proposal drew criticism across the political spectrum. Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe (who described it as [...] "a frontal assault on {{the independence of the}} federal judiciary" [...] and [...] "one of the craziest and most obviously unconstitutional things the former Speaker has ever proposed"), prominent conservative lawyer Bruce Fein (who wrote that [...] "Gingrich unwittingly is proposing to overthrow the Constitution that he would be pledged to uphold and defend if elected"), and U.S. District Judge John L. Kane (who wrote that Gingrich's proposal would contravene {{the rule of law and}} the notion of judicial independence as set forth in Federalist No. 78). Eventual 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, former Republican Attorneys General Michael Mukasey and Alberto Gonzales, conservative attorney Edward Whelan and the nonpartisan Justice at Stake group all criticized Gingrich's comments for similar reasons.|$|E
