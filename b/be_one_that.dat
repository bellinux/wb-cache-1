5|$|Early {{research}} {{on the role of}} antioxidants in biology focused on their use in preventing the oxidation of unsaturated fats, which is the cause of rancidity. Antioxidant activity could be measured simply by placing the fat in a closed container with oxygen and measuring the rate of oxygen consumption. However, it was the identification of vitamins A, C, and E as antioxidants that revolutionized the field and led to the realization of the importance of antioxidants in the biochemistry of living organisms. The possible mechanisms of action of antioxidants were first explored when it was recognized that a substance with anti-oxidative activity is likely to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> is itself readily oxidized. Research into how vitamin E prevents the process of lipid peroxidation led to the identification of antioxidants as reducing agents that prevent oxidative reactions, often by scavenging reactive oxygen species before they can damage cells.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the immense}} {{popularity}} of Verdi's music in Italy by the 1870s, Verdi's retirement seemed to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, to {{be a waste}} of talent and possible profits. Thus a plot of sorts was hatched in order to coax the composer out of retirement to write another opera. Because {{of the importance of the}} dramatic aspects of opera to the composer, Verdi was especially selective in his choice of subjects. Consequently, if he were to agree to create another opera after a decade of retirement, the libretto would need to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> would capture his interest.|$|E

25|$|In chemistry, a colloid is {{a mixture}} in which one {{substance}} of microscopically dispersed insoluble particles is suspended throughout another substance. Sometimes the dispersed substance alone is called the colloid; the term colloidal suspension refers unambiguously to the overall mixture (although a narrower {{sense of the word}} suspension is distinguished from colloids by larger particle size). Unlike a solution, whose solute and solvent constitute only one phase, a colloid has a dispersed phase (the suspended particles) and a continuous phase (the medium of suspension). To qualify as a colloid, the mixture must <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> does not settle or would take a very long time to settle appreciably.|$|E

25|$|Maximilian I shared rule {{with his}} father during the latter year of Frederick's reign, being elected King of the Romans in 1486. By {{acquiring}} the lands of the Tyrolean line of the Habsburgs in 1490 he finally reunited all the Austrian lands, divided since 1379. He also needed {{to deal with the}} Hungarian problem when Mathias I died in 1490. Maximilian reconquered the lost parts of Austria and established peace with Mathias's successor Vladislaus II at the Peace of Pressburg in 1491. However the dynastic pattern of division and unification would <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> kept repeating itself over time. With unsettled borders Maximilian found Innsbruck in the Tyrol a safer place for a capital, between his Burgundian and Austrian lands, although he was rarely in any place for very long, being acutely aware of how his father had been repeatedly besieged in Vienna.|$|E
25|$|The land {{is similar}} to the false paradise of Mount Amara in Paradise Lost, {{especially}} the Abyssinian maid's song about Mount Abora that is able to mesmerise the poet. In the manuscript copy, the location was named both Amora and Amara, and the location of both is the same. There are more connections to Paradise Lost, including how Milton associates the Tatar ruler to the Post-Edenic world in Adam's vision of the Tartar kingdom. In post-Milton accounts, the kingdom is linked with the worship of the sun, and his name is seen to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> reveals the Khan as a priest. This is reinforced by the connection of the river Alph with the Alpheus, a river that in Greece was connected to the worship of the sun. As followers of the sun, the Tatar are connected to a tradition that describes Cain as founding a city of sun worshippers and that people in Asia would build gardens in remembrance of the lost Eden.|$|E
25|$|If {{someone were}} {{to behave as}} if they {{understood}} a language which no-one else can make sense of, we might call this {{an example of a}} private language. It is not sufficient here, however, for the language to simply <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> has not yet been translated. In order to count as a private language in Wittgenstein's sense, it must be in principle incapable of translation into an ordinary language - if for example it were to describe those inner experiences supposed to be inaccessible to others. The private language being considered is not simply a language in fact understood by one person, but a language that in principle can only be understood by one person. So the last speaker of a dying language would not be speaking a private language, since the language remains in principle learnable. A private language must be unlearnable and untranslatable, and yet it must appear that the speaker is able to make sense of it.|$|E

500|$|Other parodies {{have been}} presented, {{including}} the devil corollary, the no devil corollary and the extreme no devil corollary. The devil corollary proposes that a being than which nothing worse can be conceived {{exists in the}} understanding (sometimes the term lesser is used in place of worse). Using Anselm's logical form, the parody argues that if it exists in the understanding, a worse being would <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> exists in reality; thus, such a being exists. The no devil corollary is similar, but argues that a worse being would <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> {{does not exist in}} reality, so does not exist. The extreme no devil corollary advances on this, proposing that a worse being would be that which does not exist in the understanding, so such a being exists neither in reality nor in the understanding. Timothy Chambers argued that the devil corollary is more powerful than Gaunilo's challenge because it withstands the challenges that may defeat Gaunilo's parody. He also claimed that the no devil corollary is a strong challenge, as it [...] "underwrites" [...] the no devil corollary, which [...] "threatens Anselm's argument at its very foundations".|$|E
500|$|In 1894, Hume, {{hoping for}} {{a seat in the}} state legislature, campaigned in support of Populist demands such as {{unlimited}} coinage of silver, more regulation of large corporations (like the APA), and large-scale government spending for internal improvements. Dodds says that this approach [...] "illustrates Hume's view of the purpose of a political campaign: The program advocated should <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> would win, and not necessarily the program that the party or the candidate believed in." [...] After losing this election, Hume went to Salem, the state capital, in 1895 to lobby for bills that might favor his business interests. In 1896 Hume, switching to the Republican Party, used his newspaper, the Wedderburn Gazette, to support Republican William McKinley for the U.S. presidency.|$|E

500|$|Factional strife {{at court}} first became {{apparent}} during the 1040s, {{with a new}} state reform initiated by Fan Zhongyan (989–1052). Fan was a capable military leader (with successful battles in his record against the Tanguts of Xi-Xia) but as a minister of state {{he was known as}} an idealist, once saying that a well-minded official should <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> was [...] "first in worrying about the world's troubles and last in enjoying its pleasures". When Fan rose to the seat of chancellor, there was a growing opposition to him within the older and more conservative crowd. They disliked his pushing for reforms for the recruitment system, higher pay for minor local officials to discourage against corruption, and wider sponsorship programs to ensure that officials were drafted more {{on the basis of their}} intellect and character. However, his Qingli Reforms were cancelled within a year's time (with Fan replaced as chancellor), since many older officials halfway through their careers were not keen on making changes that could affect their comfortably set positions.|$|E
500|$|After Bucer's death, his {{writings}} {{continued to be}} translated, reprinted, and disseminated throughout Europe. No [...] "Buceran" [...] denomination, however, emerged from his ministry, probably because he never developed a systematic theology as Melanchthon had for the Lutheran church and Calvin for the Reformed churches. Several groups, including Anglicans, Puritans, Lutherans, and Calvinists, claimed {{him as one of}} their own. The adaptability of his theology to each confessional point-of-view also led polemicists to criticise it as too accommodating. His theology could be best summarised as being practical and pastoral rather than theoretical. Bucer was not so concerned about staking a doctrinal claim per se, but rather he took a standpoint in order to discuss and to win over his opponents. At the same time his theological stand was grounded in the conditions of his time where he envisioned the ideal society to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> was led by an enlightened, God-centred government with all the people united under Christian fellowship. Martin Bucer is chiefly remembered for his promotion of doctrinal unity, or ecumenism, and his lifelong struggle to create an inclusive church.|$|E
