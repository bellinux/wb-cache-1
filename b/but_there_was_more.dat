5|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} varied widely, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> {{positive}} reaction than not. The greatest enthusiasm was for Rachel's fathers, though Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) was complimented on his brief scenes, and the scene with Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Karofsky (Max Adler) was also praised. The episode was also significant because it featured an on-screen kiss by Santana (Naya Rivera) and Brittany (Heather Morris), which was the show's first lesbian kiss.|$|E
25|$|The {{curriculum}} at Ward Island had {{many of the}} same topics at the three ARM Secondary Schools, but with a number of notable differences. The Navy’s airborne equipment was physically much smaller than shipboard and land-based electronics, and had to use the power generated by the carrying vehicle. Also, it was often designed to be operated by either the aircraft pilot or a crew member who had other primary duties; thus, it was necessarily easier to adjust – often including automatic tuning; therefore, lecture instruction included topics to support these requirements. Most airborne radios operated in VHF bands, and the associated antennas and their placement were important topics. Microwave radar, which required less physical space than its VHF predecessor, soon became the dominant feature in airborne applications; this required considerable attention be given to dish antennas and their mechanical drives. Sonar was not included, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> attention given to recognition (IFF), direction-finding, and LORAN radio-navigation systems. There were also special courses on subjects such as the Norden bombsight, the magnetic anomaly detector (MAD), and the Target Drone Denny (TDD-1).|$|E

Yes, we were still on track for going against Iraq, he said. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more.</b> This was being discussed {{as part of a}} five-year campaign plan, he said, and there were a total of seven countries, beginning with Iraq, then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and finishing off Iran."

[...] Still the spill continued to spew from fissures in the ocean floor, undiminished, and by noon on February 7 a $1.3 billion class action lawsuit had been filed against Union Oil and their partners on Platform A. [...] On the platform itself, workers labored continuously to try to kill the well. [...] They made their final attempt that afternoon and evening, pumping [...] of the heaviest available drilling mud into the well at pressures of thousands of pounds per square inch. [...] They had almost exhausted their supply of mud when the oil and gas boiling up from the ocean began to slow down, and by 8:00p.m. it had stopped. [...] Delivering the coup de grâce, the crews rammed over 1,000 sacks of concrete into the well. [...] Well A-21 would leak no more.
