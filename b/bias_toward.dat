40|$|According to the {{category}} adjustment model of location estimation, children's responses are <b>biased</b> <b>toward</b> spatial prototypes, and these biases increase {{under conditions of}} uncertainty. Consistent with the model, 6 - and 11 -year-olds' <b>biases</b> <b>toward</b> prototypes increased across delays, especially for locations far from prototypes. Response biases also varied systematically with target frequency; however, responses were not always <b>biased</b> <b>toward</b> prototypes. In Experiment 1, 6 -year-olds' responses to an infrequent target near {{the category}} boundary were <b>biased</b> <b>toward</b> a frequent target in an adjacent category.

40|$|The {{dynamic field}} theory predicts that <b>biases</b> <b>toward</b> remembered {{locations}} {{depend on the}} separation between targets, and the spatial precision of interactions in working memory that become enhanced over development. This was tested by varying the separation between A and B locations in a sandbox. Children searched for an object 6 times at an A location, followed by 3 trials at a B location.

When A and B were separated by 2 in., however, 4 - and 6 -year-olds' responses were <b>biased</b> <b>toward</b> A.

Childs produced it on film, not videotape, so making it possible to shoot it almost entirely on location using 16mm film (which gave it a startling degree of realism), and to use film editing techniques, enabling him to give the show a heavy <b>bias</b> <b>toward</b> action sequences.|$|E

25|$|Many tumors express {{mutations}}. These mutations potentially {{create new}} targetable antigens (neoantigens) {{for use in}} T cell immunotherapy. The presence of CD8+ T cells in cancer lesions, as identified using RNA sequencing data, is higher in tumors with a high mutational burden. The level of transcripts associated with cytolytic activity of natural killer cells and T cells positively correlates with mutational load in many human tumors. In non–small cell lung cancer patients treated with lambrolizumab, mutational load shows a strong correlation with clinical response. In melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab, long-term benefit is also associated with a higher mutational load, although less significantly. The predicted MHC binding neoantigens in patients with a long-term clinical benefit were enriched {{for a series of}} tetrapeptide motifs that were not found in tumors of patients with no or minimal clinical benefit. However, human neoantigens identified in other studies do not show the <b>bias</b> <b>toward</b> tetrapeptide signatures.|$|E
25|$|Some {{increases}} in complexity are sometimes necessary. So {{there remains a}} justified general <b>bias</b> <b>toward</b> the simpler of two competing explanations. To understand why, consider that for each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there is always {{an infinite number of}} possible, more complex, and ultimately incorrect, alternatives. This is so because one can always burden a failing explanation with an ad hoc hypothesis. Ad hoc hypotheses are justifications that prevent theories from being falsified. Even other empirical criteria, such as consilience, can never truly eliminate such explanations as competition. Each true explanation, then, may have had many alternatives that were simpler and false, but also an infinite number of alternatives that were more complex and false. But if an alternative ad hoc hypothesis were indeed justifiable, its implicit conclusions would be empirically verifiable. On a commonly accepted repeatability principle, these alternative theories have never been observed and continue to escape observation. In addition, one does not say an explanation is true if it has not withstood this principle.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, News Corporation {{retained}} {{the services of}} public relations firm Glover Park to launch a campaign aimed at delaying Nielsen's plan to replace its aging household electronic data collection methodology in larger local markets with its newer electronic People Meter system.

However, Nielsen countered the campaign by revealing its sample composition counts. According to Nielsen Media Research's sample composition counts, , nationwide, African American households using People Meters represented 6.7% of the Nielsen sample, compared to 6.0% in the general population. Latino households represent 5.7% of the Nielsen sample, compared to 5.0% in the general population. By October 2006, News Corporation and Nielsen settled, with Nielsen agreeing to spend an additional $50 million to ensure that minority viewing was not being underreported by the new electronic people meter system.|$|E

500|$|The {{selection}} of one particular quote in Carr's essay from pathologist Bruce Friedman, {{a member of}} the faculty of the University of Michigan Medical School, who commented on a developing difficulty reading books and long essays and specifically the novel War and Peace, was criticized for having a <b>bias</b> <b>toward</b> narrative literature. The quote failed to represent other types of literature, such as technical and scientific literature, which had, in contrast, become much more accessible and widely read {{with the advent of the}} Internet. At the Britannica Blog, writer Clay Shirky pugnaciously observed that War and Peace was [...] "too long, and not so interesting", further stating that [...] "it would be hard to argue that the last ten years have seen a decrease in either the availability or comprehension of material on scientific or technical subjects". Shirky's comments on War and Peace were derided by several of his peers as verging on philistinism. In Shirky's defense, inventor W. Daniel Hillis asserted that, although books [...] "were created to serve a purpose", that [...] "same purpose can often be served by better means". While Hillis considered the book to be [...] "a fine and admirable device", he imagined that clay tablets and scrolls of papyrus, in their time, [...] "had charms of their own". Wired magazine editor Kevin Kelly believed that the idea that [...] "the book is the apex of human culture" [...] should be resisted. And Birkerts differentiated online reading from literary reading, stating that in the latter the reader is directed within themselves and enters [...] "an environment that is nothing at all like the open-ended information zone that is cyberspace" [...] in which he feels psychologically fragmented.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDichroplus maculipennis and Borellia bruneri {{are two of}} the 18 {{grasshopper}} {{species of}} actual or potential economic relevance as pests in Argentina. The objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the sex ratios for adults and older nymphs of D. maculipennis and B. bruneri in the field, and analyze possible temporal variations. The study was conducted during seven seasons (2005 – 06 to 2011 – 12) in representative plant communities of the southern Pampas region. A total of 4536 individuals of D. maculipennis, and 6038 individuals of B. bruneri were collected. The sex ratio registered in older nymphs for D. maculipennis and B. bruneri did not deviate from a 1 : 1 ratio (p> 0. 05), suggesting that these species have such a primary sex ratio. However, a significant bias in sex composition in adults of both species was observed (p< 0. 05). The sex ratio in adults of D. maculipennis was different in five of the 18 sampling dates carried out. In three sampling dates it was <b>biased</b> <b>toward</b> males, while in the other two it was <b>biased</b> <b>toward</b> females. Taking into account the sex ratio by sampling season, significant differences were recorded in two seasons. In 2007 – 08 the sex ratio was <b>biased</b> <b>toward</b> males (1 F: 2. 26 M), while in 2008 – 09 it was <b>biased</b> <b>toward</b> females (1. 35 F: 1 M). The sex ratio in adults of B. bruneri was always <b>biased</b> <b>toward</b> males (p< 0. 05). We conclude that results obtained in this study indicate that various factors like differential survival, dispersion, predation, among others, could have modified the primary sex ratio in these species...|$|R
