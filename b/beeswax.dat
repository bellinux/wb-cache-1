5|$|Humans {{have kept}} honey bee colonies, {{commonly}} in hives, for millennia. Beekeepers collect honey, <b>beeswax,</b> propolis, pollen, and royal jelly from hives; bees are also kept to pollinate crops and to produce bees {{for sale to}} other beekeepers.|$|E
5|$|Nail polish: According to {{the book}} Chemical Composition Of Everyday Products, nail polish dates from 3000 BC and {{originates}} from China. Nail polish used during the Ming Dynasty was made from a mixture of egg whites, <b>beeswax,</b> dyes, gum arabic, and gelatin.|$|E
5|$|Human {{beekeeping}} or apiculture {{has been}} practised for millennia, {{since at least}} the times of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece. Apart from honey and pollination, honey bees produce <b>beeswax,</b> royal jelly and propolis. Bees have appeared in mythology and folklore, through all phases of art and literature, from ancient times to the present day, though primarily focused in the Northern Hemisphere, where beekeeping is far more common.|$|E
40|$|A rapid {{procedure}} {{for the detection}} of high-molecular-mass dienes in waxes, using a combination of chromatographic separations and direct inlet mass spectrometric determinations, allowed the determination of the presence of and the approximate relative concentrations on C 31 -C 35 dienes in some <b>beeswaxes...</b>|$|R
60|$|A second pair {{of boots}} followed, making wide and {{magnificent}} gestures {{in their attempts to}} feel the door frame. Kurt guided them to a foothold, and the Prince, shaved and brushed and <b>beeswaxed</b> and clean and big and terrible, slid down into position astride of the door. All the men and Bert also stood up and saluted.|$|R
60|$|Don John Conmee {{walked and}} moved in times of yore. He was humane and honoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a <b>beeswaxed</b> drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit clusters. And {{the hands of a}} bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.|$|R
5|$|Most other bees, {{including}} familiar insects such as carpenter bees, leafcutter {{bees and}} mason bees are solitary {{in the sense}} that every female is fertile, and typically inhabits a nest she constructs herself. There is no division of labor so these nests lack queens and worker bees for these species. Solitary bees typically produce neither honey nor <b>beeswax.</b>|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1945 (when Pius XII {{changed the}} form of ballot to use {{anonymous}} oaths, first carried out in 1958), the sealing wax on the complex type ballots illustrated above {{had the effect of}} making the smoke from burning the ballots either black or white, depending on whether or not damp straw was added. Until the 20th century, sealing wax customarily had <b>beeswax</b> mixed into its composition. The use of wax made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke, as does wax that includes <b>beeswax.</b> In the 1939 conclave there was some confusion over the smoke color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. This explains the confusion over the color of the smoke in the 1958 Papal conclave, caused by the lack of sealing wax on the ballots. The Siri thesis was based on the confusion over the smoke color {{on the first day of}} that conclave.|$|E
5|$|Shen's largest atlas {{included}} twenty three maps of China {{and foreign}} regions that were drawn at a uniform scale of 1:900,000. Shen {{also created a}} raised-relief map using sawdust, wood, <b>beeswax,</b> and wheat paste. Zhu Xi (1130–1200) {{was inspired by the}} raised-relief map of Huang Shang and so made his own portable map made of wood and clay which could be folded up from eight hinged pieces.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes;--as he used it;--and indiscreet, and ignorant, and stupid. I bore it all, though {{sometimes}} I was dying with vexation. Now it's all over, {{and here we}} are as humdrum as any one else. And the <b>Beeswaxes,</b> and the Robys, and the Droughts, and the Pountneys, and the Lopezes, have all passed over the scene! Do you remember that Pountney affair, and how he turned the poor man out of the house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{suddenly}} {{he found that}} the room was nearly empty. The <b>Beeswaxes</b> and the Gotobeds were gone; and at last the poet himself, with a final glare of admiration at Isabel, had taken his departure. When Silverbridge looked round, Isabel also was gone. Then too Mrs. Boncassen had left the room suddenly. At the same instant Mr. Boncassen entered by another door, and the two men were alone together. [...] "My dear Lord Silverbridge," [...] said the father, [...] "I want to have a few words with you." [...] Of course there was nothing for him but to submit. [...] "You remember what you said to me down at Matching?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. and Miss Helstone were {{ushered into}} a parlour. Of course, as {{was to be}} {{expected}} in such a Gothic old barrack, this parlour was lined with oak: fine, dark, glossy panels compassed the walls gloomily and grandly. Very handsome, reader, these shining brown panels are, very mellow in colouring and tasteful in effect, but--if you know what a [...] "spring clean" [...] is--very execrable and inhuman. Whoever, having the bowels of humanity, has seen servants scrubbing at these polished wooden walls with <b>beeswaxed</b> cloths on a warm May day must allow that they are [...] "intolerable and not to be endured;" [...] and I cannot but secretly applaud the benevolent barbarian who had painted another and larger apartment of Fieldhead--the drawing-room, to wit, formerly also an oak-room--of a delicate pinky white, thereby earning for himself the character of a Hun, but mightily enhancing the cheerfulness of that portion of his abode, and saving future housemaids a world of toil.|$|R
5|$|Kulintang gongs {{are made}} using the cire perdue method, a lost-wax process used for casting the {{individual}} gongs. The first phase {{is the creation}} of wax molds of the gongs. In the past, before the availability of standardized wax sheets made specifically for foundry use, the molds were made out of either <b>beeswax</b> (talo) or candle wax (kandilà). The wax mold is covered with a special mixture of finely powdered coal/mud, which is applied on the wax surface using a brush.|$|E
5|$|Since medieval times, dubbin, a waxy product, {{was used}} to soften and {{waterproof}} leather; however, it did not impart shine. It was made from natural wax, oil, soda ash and tallow. As leather with a high natural veneer became popular in the 18th century, a high glossy finish became important, particularly on shoes and boots. In most cases, a variety of homemade polishes were used to provide this finish, often with lanolin or <b>beeswax</b> as a base.|$|E
5|$|The fastidious little mouse {{spends a}} {{fortnight}} spring cleaning. She rubs the furniture with <b>beeswax</b> and polishes her little tin spoons, then holds {{a party for}} five other little wood-mice wearing their Regency finery. Mr. Jackson attends but is forced to sit outside because Mrs. Tittlemouse has narrowed her door. He takes no offence at being excluded from the parlour. Acorn-cupfuls of honeydew are passed through the window {{to him and he}} toasts Mrs. Tittlemouse's good health.|$|E
60|$|A convivial lunch I hold to be {{altogether}} bad, but {{the worst}} of its many evils is that vacillating mind which does not know when to take its owner off. Silverbridge was on this occasion quite determined not to take himself off at all. As {{it was only a}} lunch the people must go, and then he would be left with Isabel. But the vacillation of the others was distressing to him. Mr. Lupton went, and poor Dolly got away apparently without a word. But the <b>Beeswaxes</b> and the Gotobeds would not go, and the poet sat staring immovably. In the meanwhile Silverbridge endeavoured to make the time pass lightly by talking to Mrs. Boncassen. He had been so determined to accept Isabel with all her adjuncts that he had come almost to like Mrs. Boncassen, and would certainly have taken her part violently had any one spoken ill of her in his presence.|$|R
40|$|Pomegranate {{seed oil}} (PSO) {{contains}} considerable amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids including conjugated linolenic acid (CLnA) isomers, like punicic acid (18 : 3 – 9 cis, 11 trans, 13 cis), with remarkable therapeutic and preventive effects on human health. Unfortunately, different issues {{have to be}} overcome {{in the attempt to}} enrich food with PSO. A major issue is {{to find a way to}} delivery it in a system that allows its incorporation in the food matrix as well as protecting it from oxidation. The gelation of oil by using a three-dimensional gel network of small self-assembled molecules could be a pursuable strategy. The aim of the present research was to develop PSO organogels by using <b>beeswaxes</b> and waxes extracted from propolis. It should be noted that propolis waxes was proposed in this study as new natural organogalator. After the chemical characterization of propolis and bees waxes, PSO was mixed with the two type of waxes and their mixture (1 : 1) at different concentration (5, 10 and 15...|$|R
40|$|The direct {{chemical}} analysis allows investigating samples without altering them, keeping the sample available for further analysis. For the qualitative investigation, analytical procedures like gas-chromatography, Raman microscopy, and Infra Red spectroscopy are available; however, the univariate approach is not exhaustive {{in the case of}} very complex matrices. The quantitative approach is still an open issue, due to the strong matrix effect hindering the creation of univariate calibration methods in interpolation mode. The multivariate analysis may be the solution. Three-way Principal Components Analysis (PCA) allows for comprehension of variables influencing classification. The Partial Least Squares regression (PLS) combined with Discriminant Analysis (DA) allows classifying. Multivariate standard addition calibration based on PLS coupled with Net Analyte Signal (NAS) calculation allows bypassing the matrix effect in quantitative analysis. This Chapter is focused on the issues mentioned above. Three sections will be presented: SECTION 1 :	 three-way PCA is applied to the discrimination among bacterial species in samples analyzed as such by pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Applications to timely analysis of pathogenic microbes are foreseen. SECTION 2 	PLS-DA is applied to Raman spectra to discriminate adulterated <b>beeswaxes</b> from natural ones. This procedure may be implemented to prevent possible adulteration of bees’ products. SECTION 3 	PLS-NAS is applied to ATR spectra to quantify biogenic silica in marine sediments. The new method allows to accurately study the time evolution of primary productivity in the Antarctic basins...|$|R
5|$|Wax {{resist dyeing}} of fabric {{is an ancient}} art form. It already existed in Egypt in the 4th century BC, where {{it was used to}} wrap mummies; linen was soaked in wax, and {{scratched}} using a stylus. In Asia, the technique was practised in China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), and in India and Japan during the Nara Period (645-794 AD). In Africa it was originally practised by the Yoruba tribe in Nigeria, Soninke and Wolof in Senegal. These African version however, uses cassava starch or rice paste, or mud as a resist instead of <b>beeswax.</b>|$|E
5|$|Spalding {{had been}} a port from before any of the river {{improvements}} were made. The townspeople had refused to repair the river {{during the reign of}} Henry III, as they claimed {{it was part of the}} sea here. Its importance as a port increased with the river improvements and the Stamford Canal, and although it did not have a customs house, by 1695 it had various officials who acted as customs officers for goods arriving at the quays and warehouses. Exports included oats, coleseed, rape oil, hides and wool, with a much greater variety of imports, including stone, timber, coal, groceries, glass and <b>beeswax.</b> More exotic imports included French and Spanish wines, and some of the first imports of tea, coffee and chocolate.|$|E
5|$|The art of batik is {{most highly}} {{developed}} in the island of Java in Indonesia. In Java, all the materials for the process are readily available — cotton and <b>beeswax</b> and plants from which different vegetable dyes are made. Indonesian batik predates written records: G. P. Rouffaer argues that the technique might have been introduced during the 6th or 7th century from India or Sri Lanka. On the other hand, the Dutch archaeologist J.L.A. Brandes and the Indonesian archaeologist F.A. Sutjipto believe Indonesian batik is a native tradition, since other regions in Indonesia such as Toraja, Flores, Halmahera, and Papua, which were not directly influenced by Hinduism, have an age-old tradition of batik making.|$|E
6000|$|The {{author of}} that {{brilliant}} romance, [...] "Red Hearts a-Beating," [...] was a less imposing man than Kipps had anticipated, but he speedily effaced that disappointment by his predominating manners. Although he lived habitually in the vivid world of London, his collar and tie {{were in no}} way remarkable, and he was neither brilliantly handsome nor curly nor long-haired. His personal appearance suggested arm chairs, rather than the equestrian exercises and amorous toyings and passionate intensities of his masterpiece; he was inclined to be fat, with whitish flesh, muddy coloured straight hair, he had a rather shapeless and truncated nose and his chin was asymmetrical. One eye was more inclined to stare than the other. He might have been esteemed a little undistinguished looking {{were it not for}} his <b>beeswaxed</b> moustache, which came amidst his features with a pleasing note of incongruity, and the whimsical wrinkles above and about his greater eye. His regard sought and found Helen's as he entered the room and they shook hands presently with an air of intimacy Kipps, for no clear reason, found objectionable. He saw them clasp their hands, heard Coote's characteristic cough--a sound rather more like a very, very old sheep, {{a quarter of a mile}} away, being blown to pieces by a small charge of gunpowder than anything else in the world--did some confused beginnings of a thought, and then they were all going in to dinner and Helen's shining bare arm lay along his sleeve. Kipps was in no state for conversation. She glanced at him, and, though he did not know it, very slightly pressed his elbow. He struggled with strange respiratory dislocations. Before them went Coote, discoursing in amiable reverberations to Mrs. Walshingham, and at the head of the procession was Mrs. Bindon Botting talking fast and brightly beside the erect military figure of little Mr. Wace. (He was not a soldier really, but he had caught a martinet bearing by living so close to Shorncliffe.) Revel came last, in charge of Mrs. Wace's queenly black and steel, politely admiring in a flute-like cultivated voice the mellow wall paper of the staircase. Kipps marvelled at everybody's self-possession.|$|R
5|$|Raised-relief map: The raised-relief map {{may have}} existed in China since the 3rd century BC, if the {{accounts}} in the Records of the Grand Historian (by Sima Qian, 91 BC) about Qin Shi Huang's (r. 221–210 BC) tomb prove correct (if it is excavated). It {{is known that}} Ma Yuan (14 BC– 49 AD) created a raised-relief map in 32 AD made out of rice, a type of map described in detail during the Tang Dynasty (618–907) by Jiang Fang in his Essay on the Art of Constructing Mountains with Rice (c. 845). Xie Zhuang (421–466) of the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479) created a 0.93 m2 (10ft2) wooden raised-relief map of the empire (showing mountains and rivers) which could be taken apart and pieced together like a giant jigsaw puzzle. Shen Kuo also created his own raised-relief map using sawdust, wood, <b>beeswax,</b> and wheat paste.|$|E
5|$|Man-eaters {{have been}} a {{particular}} problem in recent decades in India and Bangladesh, especially in Kumaon, Garhwal and the Sundarbans mangrove swamps of Bengal, where some healthy tigers have hunted humans. Because of rapid habitat loss attributed to climate change, tiger attacks have increased in the Sundarbans. The Sundarbans area had 129 human deaths from tigers from 1969 to 1971. In the 10 years prior to that period, about 100 attacks {{per year in the}} Sundarbans, with a high of around 430 in some years of the 1960s. Unusually, in some years in the Sundarbans, more humans are killed by tigers than vice versa. In 1972, India's production of honey and <b>beeswax</b> dropped by 50% when at least 29 people who gathered these materials were devoured. In 1986 in the Sundarbans, since tigers almost always attack from the rear, masks with human faces were worn {{on the back of the}} head, on the theory that tigers usually do not attack if seen by their prey. This decreased the number of attacks only temporarily. All other means to prevent attacks, such as providing more prey or using electrified human dummies, worked less well.|$|E
25|$|Honeycomb: From the {{honeycomb}} of the honeybee. Both <b>beeswax</b> {{and honey}} can be solvent extracted {{to produce an}} absolute. <b>Beeswax</b> is extracted with ethanol and the ethanol evaporated to produce <b>beeswax</b> absolute.|$|E
25|$|Worker bees of {{a certain}} age secrete <b>beeswax</b> from a series of glands on their abdomens. They use the wax to form the walls and caps of the comb. As with honey, <b>beeswax</b> is {{gathered}} by humans for various purposes.|$|E

25|$|Art and Handwork is {{introduced}} with painting, drawing, knitting, and <b>beeswax</b> modeling. As students progress, more sophisticated painting and drawing {{is introduced}}, {{as well as}} carving, pottery, sculpture, cross-stitch, sewing, carpentry, and woodworking.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{production}} of RDX could {{not continue to}} rely on the use of natural <b>beeswax</b> to desensitize the RDX. A substitute stabilizer based on petroleum was developed at the Bruceton Explosives Research Laboratory.|$|E

25|$|Workers have {{morphological}} specializations, {{including the}} pollen basket (corbicula), abdominal glands that produce <b>beeswax,</b> brood-feeding glands, and barbs on the sting. Under certain conditions (for example, if the colony becomes queenless), a worker may develop ovaries.|$|E
25|$|The {{honeycomb}} {{is removed}} from the hive and the honey may be extracted from that, either by crushing or by using a honey extractor. The honey is then usually filtered to remove <b>beeswax</b> and other debris.|$|E
25|$|Using <b>beeswax</b> to make dreads {{can cause}} {{problems}} {{because it does}} not wash out, due to the high melting point of natural wax. Because wax is a hydrocarbon, water alone, no matter how hot, {{will not be able to}} remove wax.|$|E
25|$|To {{produce their}} objects, the people used melting pots, torches and ovens. The tumbaga was poured into heated stone moulds filled with <b>beeswax</b> to {{elaborate}} the desired figures. The heat would melt the wax and leave {{space for the}} gold to replace it. The advanced techniques produced highly stylilised figures.|$|E
25|$|Icons {{are often}} {{illuminated}} with a candle or jar of oil with a wick. (<b>Beeswax</b> for candles {{and olive oil}} for oil lamps are preferred because they burn very cleanly, although other materials are sometimes used.) The illumination of religious images with lamps or candles is an ancient practice pre-dating Christianity.|$|E
