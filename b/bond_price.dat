25|$|The {{mortgage}} bonds were {{a way for}} {{the bank}} to raise funds. The bonds, nominal value 100 rubles, were sold to the public by the borrower or the bank. The bank guaranteed redemption of the bonds with its capital and the mortgaged property. A market developed for these bonds. Initially, the market price fluctuated between 81 and 93.25 rubles. Due to the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), the price dropped to 78 rubles. When prices rebounded and stabilized at 92–96 rubles, Russian government ordered to lower the interest rate to 5% in 1886. In 1895, the bonds traded at 99–102 rubles and the government lowered the interest to 4.5%. In 1900, among Russian land banks, only Moscow Land Bank had more outstanding mortgage bonds. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, the <b>bond</b> <b>price</b> dropped to 68 rubles. After the revolution, the market recovered and in early 1913 Vilnius Land Bank had 146.5 million rubles worth of mortgage bonds outstanding. In 1913 they traded at an average of 86 rubles.|$|E

2500|$|Under this approach, the <b>bond</b> <b>price</b> {{should reflect}} its [...] "arbitrage-free" [...] price, as any {{deviation}} from this price will be exploited and the bond will then quickly reprice to its correct level. Here, we apply the rational pricing logic relating to [...] "Assets with identical cash flows". In detail: (1) the bond's coupon dates and coupon amounts are known with certainty. Therefore, (2) some multiple (or fraction) of zero-coupon bonds, each {{corresponding to the}} bond's coupon dates, can be specified so as to produce identical cash flows to the bond. Thus (3) the <b>bond</b> <b>price</b> today must be equal to the sum of each of its cash flows discounted at the discount rate implied by {{the value of the}} corresponding ZCB. [...] Were this not the case, (4) the arbitrageur could finance his purchase of whichever of the bond or the sum of the various ZCBs was cheaper, by short selling the other, and meeting his cash flow commitments using the coupons or maturing zeroes as appropriate. Then (5) his [...] "risk free", arbitrage profit would be {{the difference between the two}} values.|$|E
