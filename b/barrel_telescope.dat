50|$|The {{designers}} project further improvements. These include improved projectile {{technologies such}} as environmentally friendly bullets and a change in bullet size {{in order to increase}} combat effectiveness, as well as the integration of electronics such as ammunition count readouts, lasers, optical sights, rangefinders, and bullet drop compensation. The Army is pursuing cased telescoped ammunition. This development is far along, and they say a new LMG could be fielded within two years (2014) with unequivocal support. The Marine Corps is pursuing caseless ammunition, which is less developed and will take several more years to refine. A compact version is also being developed with a 4-inch shorter <b>barrel</b> and folding, <b>telescoping</b> buttstock. The 5.56 mm LSAT machine gun has been renamed the Cased Telescoped Light Machine Gun (CT LMG).|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{supporting}} power being {{estimated at}} 2500 pounds, {{and the united}} weights of the party amounting only to about 1200, there was left a surplus of 1300, of which again 1200 was exhausted by ballast, arranged in bags of different sizes, with their respective weights marked upon them--by cordage, barometers, <b>telescopes,</b> <b>barrels</b> containing provision for a fortnight, water-casks, cloaks, carpet-bags, and various other indispensable matters, including a coffee-warmer, contrived for warming coffee by means of slack-lime, so as to dispense altogether with fire, if it should be judged prudent to do so. All these articles, {{with the exception of}} the ballast, and a few trifles, were suspended from the hoop overhead. The car is much smaller and lighter, in proportion, than the one appended to the model. It is formed of a light wicker, and is wonderfully strong, for so frail looking a machine. Its rim is about four feet deep. The rudder is also very much larger, in proportion, than that of the model; and the screw is considerably smaller. The balloon is furnished besides with a grapnel, and a guide-rope; which latter is of the most indispensable importance. A few words, in explanation, will here be necessary for such of our readers as are not conversant with the details of aerostation.|$|R
40|$|The Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) is a {{proposed}} mission to densely map the polarization {{of the cosmic}} microwave background. It will operate in a scanning mode from a sun-synchronous orbit, using low temperature detectors (at 0. 1 K) and located inside a teslescope that is cooled to approximately 2. 73 K - to match the background temperature. A mechanical cryocooler operating at 4. 5 K establishes a low base temperature from which two adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR) assemblies will cool the telescope and detectors. To achieve continuous scanning capability, the ADRs must operate continuously. Complicating the design are two factors: 1) the need to systematically vary the temperature of various telescope components in order to separate the small polarization signal variations from those that may arise from temperature drifts and changing gradients within the telescope, and 2) the orbital and monthly variations in lunar irradiance into the <b>telescope</b> <b>barrels.</b> These factors require the telescope ADR to reject quasi-continuous heat loads of 2 - 3 millwatts, while maintaining a peak heat reject rate of less than 12 milliwatts. The detector heat load at 0. 1 K is comparatively small at 1 - 2 microwatts. This paper will describe the 3 -stage and 2 -stage continuous ADRs {{that will be used}} to meet the cooling power and temperature stability requirements of the PIXIE detectors and telescope...|$|R
50|$|In Vietnam, some {{soldiers}} were issued a carbine {{version of the}} M16 called the XM177. The XM177 had a shorter 10 in <b>barrel</b> and a <b>telescoping</b> stock, which made it substantially more compact. It also possessed a combination flash hider/sound moderator to reduce problems with muzzle flash and loud report. The Air Force's GAU-5/A (XM177) and the Army's XM177E1 variants differed over the latter’s inclusion of a forward assist, although some GAU-5s do have the forward assist. The final Air Force GAU-5/A and Army XM177E2 had an 11.5 in barrel with a longer flash/sound suppressor. The lengthening of the barrel was to support the attachment of Colt's own XM148 40 mm grenade launcher. These versions were {{also known as the}} Colt Commando model commonly referenced and marketed as the CAR-15. The variants were issued in limited numbers to special forces, helicopter crews, Air Force pilots, Air Force Security Police Military Working Dog (MWD) handlers, officers, radio operators, artillerymen, and troops other than front line riflemen. Some USAF GAU-5A/As were later equipped with even longer 14.5 in 1/12 rifled barrels as the two shorter versions were worn out. The 14.5 in barrel allowed the use of MILES gear and for bayonets to be used with the sub-machine guns (as the Air Force described them). By 1989, the Air Force started to replace the earlier barrels with 1/7 rifled models for use with the M855-round. The weapons were given the redesignation of GUU-5/P.|$|R
2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to avoid {{destroying}} normal ideas of cause and effect, some theoreticians suggested that information about whether there was or was not a second beam-splitter installed could somehow be transmitted from the end point of the experimental device back to the photon as it was just entering that experimental device, thus permitting it to make the proper [...] "decision." [...] So Wheeler proposed a cosmic version of his experiment. In that thought experiment he asks {{what would happen if}} a quasar or other galaxy millions or billions of light years away from Earth passes its light around an intervening galaxy or cluster of galaxies that would act as a gravitational lens. A photon heading exactly towards Earth would encounter the distortion of space {{in the vicinity of the}} intervening massive galaxy. At that point it would have to [...] "decide" [...] whether to go by one way around the lensing galaxy, traveling as a particle, or go both ways around by traveling as a wave. When the photon arrived at an astronomical observatory at Earth, what would happen? Due to the gravitational lensing, telescopes in the observatory see two images of the same quasar, one to the left of the lensing galaxy and one to the right of it. If the photon has traveled as a particle and comes into the <b>barrel</b> of a <b>telescope</b> aimed at the left quasar image it must have decided to travel as a particle all those millions of years, or so say some experimenters. That telescope is pointing the wrong way to pick up anything from the other quasar image. If the photon traveled as a particle and went the other way around, then it will only be picked up by the telescope pointing at the right [...] "quasar." [...] So millions of years ago the photon decided to travel in its guise of particle and randomly chose the other path. But the experimenters now decide to try something else. They direct the output of the two telescopes into a beam-splitter, as diagrammed, and discover that one output is very bright (indicating positive interference) and that the other output is essentially zero, indicating that the incoming wavefunction pairs have self-cancelled.|$|R
