[...] "The way we do things now is very different than the way we did things <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning.

500|$|Mega Man 6 is {{occasionally}} seen as [...] "redundant" [...] to the series. GameSpot editors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer labeled Mega Man 6 the [...] "cheesiest" [...] {{among the}} NES titles: [...] "If you're looking for mega-laughs, {{you might want}} to try this one out." [...] 1UP.com contributors likewise found that the game's [...] "inane" [...] storyline and villains both insult fans of the series and outweigh the game's good soundtrack and interesting power-ups. The four members of the Electronic Gaming Monthly review panel all voiced similar opinions regarding the game's familiar 8-bit presentation and its addition to the already repetitive nature of the series. One reviewer commented, [...] "OK, Mega Man was fun and original <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> when the letters 'N E S' meant something. Now the game is just getting redundant. Oh sure, Mega Man may learn a few new tricks here and there but this series has to end soon." ...|$|E
500|$|Many rappers {{have taken}} note of Illmatics {{influence}} on their lyricism.

The whole Illmatic album forced you {{to go ahead and}} do shit... It was inspiration." [...] Detroit rapper Elzhi states, [...] "round the time Nas did Illmatic, it made me wanna step my game up... He's one of the reasons I did go off into storytelling because his pictures were so vivid. When he displayed his rhyme schemes and his word play and his songs, it made me wanna create visual pictures as well." [...] Casey Veggies also recounts the impact Nas' lyricism had on his own work as an underground rapper in the 2000s: “I [...] Illmatic when I was 14, 15. I didn’t get onto to it till late, but when I did, that's probably the only thing I listened to for six months to a year... After I got heavy on Illmatic, I put out Sleeping In Class (2010). That's when I really tried to sharpen my skills and get better.” ...|$|E

500|$|The third single [...] "911 Is a Joke" [...] {{features}} Flavor Flav as {{the lead}} MC. He was given the idea by Chuck D to write the song. As Flav recalled, [...] "I went and got high and wrote the record. I went and got ripped, I went {{and got out of}} my mind, and I started speaking all kinds of crazy shit 'cos usually <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> when I used to smoke, it used to broaden my ideas and everything". The humorous and satirical subject matter is reflected in its music video, which featured a severely injured Flav being mistreated by a remiss, overdue ambulance staff. Another Flavor Flav-solo track, the fifth single [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man", has lyrics advocating African-American self-reliance and denouncing welfare dependence. It also reflects on Flav's experiences with acquaintances from poor neighborhoods. He said of his inspiration for the song, [...] "I was in my Corvette riding from Long Island going to The Bronx. I was slipping. I was roasting. I mean I was smoked-out crazy. And everybody kept asking me for stuff and yet nobody wanted to give me stuff. So then if anybody ever asked me for something I would be like, 'Yo, I can't do nothing for ya man.' Next thing you know I started to vibe on it: 'I can't do nothing for ya man,' um ahh um um ahh. So I went and told that to Chuck. Chuck was like, 'Record that shit man'". Writing of both tracks, music critic Tom Moon comments that Flav [...] "affects a tone of gimme-a-break sarcasm that is crucial to both tracks, and is welcome respite from Chuck D.'s assault". [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man" [...] was featured in the 1990 comedy film House Party.|$|E
500|$|Led by league MVP Tittle, {{who passed}} for over 3,000yards and 36 touchdowns, the Giants had an 11–3 record in 1963. They set what remains the NFL's {{record for most}} points in a 14-game season by scoring 448. They {{advanced}} to face the Chicago Bears in the NFL championship game. On an icy field, New York's defense played well, but Chicago's newly invented zone defense intercepted Tittle five times (including one returned for a score) and injured Tittle {{in the first half}} (though he finished the game). Several Giants players including linebacker Huff pleaded with Sherman to replace the hobbled Tittle, who the players felt was pressing and committing too many turnovers, from playing the second half. Sherman however, had little alternative. [...] "The old man kept saying 'I can do it. I feel a little better'" [...] Sherman recalled. [...] "We had a young quarterback (Glynn Griffing), he had gone to get married a couple of weeks earlier but failed to come <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> he said he would. We couldn't use him." [...] The Giants defense, led by Hall of Famer Huff, held the Bears in check, but they lost 14–10, their third straight NFL Championship Game defeat. New York had a chance to take a 14–0 lead in the first quarter but wide receiver Del Shofner dropped a potential touchdown in the end zone, a drop he said in 2010, that he feels would have won the Giants the game. [...] "I was alone in the end zone—ball right into my hands, nobody around me—and I dropped the ball...as good a defense as we had that year, I don't think the Berar would have ever come back from being down 14–0." [...] On the next play, Tittle threw an interception to Chicago linebacker Larry Morris, which he returned to the New York five-yard line. Two plays later, the Bears tied the game.|$|E

2500|$|In {{defining}} conservatism, Reagan said: [...] "If you {{analyze it}} I believe {{the very heart}} and soul of conservatism is libertarianism. I think conservatism is really a misnomer just as liberalism is a misnomer for the liberals—if we were <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of the Revolution, so-called conservatives today would be the Liberals and the liberals would be the Tories. The basis of conservatism is a desire for less government interference or less centralized authority or more individual freedom and this is a pretty general description also of what libertarianism is." [...] Reagan's views on government were influenced by Thomas Jefferson, especially his hostility to strong central governments. [...] "We're still Jefferson's children," [...] he declared in 1987. He also stated, [...] "Freedom is not created by Government, nor is it a gift from those in political power. It is, in fact, secured, more than anything else, by limitations placed on those in Government". Likewise he greatly admired and often quoted Abraham Lincoln.|$|E

The top panel is surmounted with a carved representation of the serpent-like animal {{with the head of}} a singa. At the bottom panel is four legs or hooves. Achim Sibeth commented that the animal is the representation of the Naga Padoha, a primordial water serpent that rules the underworld. A Batak creation myth told that <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> when there was only sea, the serpent stirred up sand from the ocean bed to create the first islands which create the islands of Indonesia. Other expert thinks that the figure represents the singa. The word singa, borrowed from Sanskrit singa meaning [...] "lion", dates back to contact with Hindu traders in the southern Batak area. In Batak culture however, the singa itself is a complicated mythical creature related to the female serpent.

2500|$|Although drug-related {{violence}} has existed {{since the early}} beginnings of the Gulf Cartel, it often happened in low-profile levels, while the government agreed to [...] "look the other way" [...] while the drug traffickers went about their business—as long as they behaved. <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of the 71-year rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), {{it was believed that}} they ran exactly that show: if the drug cartels got off the line, the Mexican government would conduct some arrests, make some disappearances, and the drug lords would get their people straight and back on the line again. [...] After the PRI lost the presidency in 2000 to the National Action Party (PAN), the arrangement {{between the government and the}} cartels was lost, as well the pax mafiosa. Moreover, the state of Tamaulipas was no exception; according to Santiago Creel, a PAN politician and pre-candidate for the 2012 presidency, the PRI in Tamaulipas has protected the Gulf Cartel for years. In addition, El Universal newspaper mentions that the narco-corruption in Tamaulipas is due to the fact the opposing political parties, the PAN and the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), rarely win an election and [...] "practically do not exist". PRI's main opposition party, the PAN, claimed that government elections in Tamaulipas are likely to encounter an [...] "organized crime influence." ...|$|E
