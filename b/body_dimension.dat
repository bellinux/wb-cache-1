The {{aim of this}} study was to screen the candidate genes and molecular markers associated with <b>body</b> <b>dimension</b> and body weight traits in pigs. Methods A genome-wide association study (GWAS) on <b>body</b> <b>dimension</b> and body weight traits was performed in a White Duroc×Erhualian F 2 intercross by the illumina PorcineSNP 60 K Beadchip. A mixed linear model was used to assess the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the phenotypes. Results In total, 611 and 79 SNPs were identified significantly associated with <b>body</b> <b>dimension</b> traits and body weight respectively. All SNPs but 62 were located into 23 genomic regions (quantitative trait loci, QTLs) on 14 autosomal and X chromosomes in Sus scrofa Build 10. 2 assembly. Out of the 23 QTLs with the suggestive significance level (5 × 10 − 4), three QTLs exceeded the genome-wide significance threshold (1. 15 × 10 − 6). Except the one on Sus scrofa chromosome (SSC) 7 which was reported previously all the QTLs are novel. In addition, we identified 5 promising candidate genes, including cell division cycle 7 for abdominal circumference, pleiomorphic adenoma gene 1 and neuropeptides B/W receptor 1 for both body weight and cannon bone circumference on SSC 4, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1, and bone morphogenetic protein 7 for hip circumference on SSC 17.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the existing design of the classroom desk used in the basic education stage in public schools in the city of Benghazi. This article reports results of the second phase of the study which covers the fourth and the fifth grades. Anthropometric data were gathered for a total of 120 students (children of age 9 to 11 years old, half males) from four schools. Several body dimensions were measured for each student (popliteal height, popliteal-buttock length, shoulder height sitting, knee height, elbow height sitting, shoulder to elbow length, and hip breadth sitting). The evaluation procedure involves the utilization of several equations relating body dimensions to desk dimensions. Each equation computes an acceptable range for each desk dimension based on the associated <b>body</b> <b>dimension.</b> Each desk dimension is compared to the range computed for the related <b>body</b> <b>dimension</b> for each student and percentages of matches/mismatches are determined accordingly.
