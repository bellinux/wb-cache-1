5|$|The highway {{was first}} {{designated}} in 1919 between Hastings and Battle Creek. It was later moved {{to run to}} Charlotte. A section of M-79 was designated as M-214 in the 1930s. M-214 would later <b>be</b> <b>decommissioned</b> as a highway designation and the M-79 designation was reapplied to the roadway.|$|E
5|$|Between 1945 and 1950 the US {{fleet of}} battleships had been entirely decommissioned; however, Missouri was spared this fate {{due to the}} {{influence}} of President Harry S. Truman, a native Missourian, who refused to allow the battleship to <b>be</b> <b>decommissioned,</b> and against the advice of Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson, Secretary of the Navy John L. Sullivan, and Chief of Naval Operations Louis E. Denfeld, Truman ordered Missouri to be maintained with the active fleet partly because of his fondness for the battleship and partly because the battleship had been christened by his daughter. As a result, Missouri was involved in various training and flag waving exercises at home and abroad between World War II and the Korean War.|$|E
25|$|On 11 December 2012, Wewak <b>was</b> <b>decommissioned.</b> Balikpapan and Betano <b>were</b> both <b>decommissioned</b> a day later, on 12 December. The {{other three}} Australian vessels <b>were</b> <b>decommissioned</b> on 20 November 2014.|$|R

5000|$|Six {{boats were}} built and commissioned. Swiftsure <b>was</b> <b>decommissioned</b> in 1992 due to damage {{suffered}} to her pressure hull during trials. [...] followed in 2004 after defence cuts caused {{a reduction in}} the size of the Royal Navy submarine fleet. [...] <b>was</b> <b>decommissioned</b> in January 2006, with [...] following on 12 September 2006. [...] <b>was</b> <b>decommissioned</b> on 26 September 2008.

5|$|The {{demolition}} {{contract for}} the station was won by London-based company Brown & Mason. Before the demolition of the stations' main structures, it was required that they <b>be</b> <b>decommissioned.</b> This involved the removal of hazardous materials and contaminants, to keep in line with Health & Safety at Work regulations. Oils and chemicals were removed for re-use or disposal and storage tanks were flushed out. Methanol was removed from hydrogen production plants on site, along with bottled propane used for welding. The remaining coal in the coal storage area was dispatched to operating power stations {{in other parts of}} the country. The landfill site where ash waste from the station was dumped was topsoiled. Asbestos used in the stations was removed prior to the demolition of the stations' structures.|$|E
5|$|The four cruisers {{nevertheless}} {{had long}} service lives, which included periods {{with the main}} Italian fleet {{as well as on}} foreign stations. Etna served on the North American Station from 1893 to 1895, and in 1899, Ettore Fieramosca, Vesuvio, and Stromboli participated in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in China. Etna was rebuilt into a training ship in 1905–1907, and in 1909 she took part in the Hudson-Fulton Celebration. Ettore Fieramosca was the first member of the class to <b>be</b> <b>decommissioned,</b> and she was sold for scrap in 1909. Stromboli followed in 1911 and Vesuvio was discarded in 1915. Etna remained in service longer than her sisters; she saw action during the Italo-Turkish War, and during World War I, she served as the headquarters ship in Taranto. She was ultimately discarded in 1921.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the investigation, {{according}} to Thompson, Admiral Leon A. Edney, the Navy's Vice Chief of Naval Operations, {{interfered with the}} investigation by sending suggestions to Milligan on avenues of inquiry and pushing for a finding that Hartwig or Truitt was responsible. Edney interfered with the investigation {{in order to prevent}} any findings that the Navy had knowingly operated an unsafe ship in an unsafe manner. Also, Edney feared that if the Iowa class battleships were found to be unsafe, the battleships would <b>be</b> <b>decommissioned</b> and the Navy would lose the associated admiral billets plus the other warships and support ships assigned to the battleship groups.|$|E

5|$|All five ships served {{extensively}} in Germany's colonial possessions in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. Seeadler {{participated in the}} suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, Falke participated in the Venezuela Crisis of 1902–03, and Condor and Cormoran helped to defeat the Sokehs Rebellion in the Caroline Islands in 1911. Bussard and Falke were scrapped in 1912, while Seeadler and Condor returned to Germany in 1914 to <b>be</b> <b>decommissioned.</b> Cormoran and Geier remained in the Pacific at the outbreak of World War I; the former's engines were worn out and she was scuttled in Tsingtao. Geier briefly attacked British shipping in the Pacific but put into Hawaii after running out of fuel. She was interned, seized by the US Navy in 1917, and commissioned as USS Schurz; she briefly served in the US Navy before she was accidentally rammed and sunk by a freighter in June 1918. Meanwhile, Seeadler was destroyed by an accidental explosion in 1917. Condor was {{the only member of the}} class to survive the war; she was broken up for scrap in 1921.|$|E
5|$|Boden Fortress {{is made up}} of five primary {{self-supporting}} forts excavated out of {{the bedrock}} in five of the mountains surrounding Boden: Degerberget, Mjösjöberget, Gammelängsberget, Södra Åberget and Rödberget. Eight fortified secondary artillery positions were constructed between the forts to give flanking support and to cover areas not in range of the main forts' artillery. In addition, 40 bunkers for infantry, along with dugouts and other fortifications, were built to cover even more terrain. During the Second World War anti-tank gun emplacements and additional bunkers and shelters were built, and tens of kilometres of dragon's teeth were placed around the fortress and the city itself. Owing {{to the end of the}} Cold War and the reduction of the threat from the Soviet Union, Boden Fortress became less important to the defence of Sweden, and began to <b>be</b> <b>decommissioned.</b> The last fort of the complex was decommissioned on 31 December 1998, and is now used as a tourist attraction. All five forts as well as some of the supporting structures have been declared historic buildings, to be preserved for the future, by the Swedish government.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, {{plans were}} made for US 140 to <b>be</b> <b>decommissioned,</b> with MD 97 to replace the section between Westminster and the Pennsylvania border, where it would connect to PA 97. This {{proposal}} was made in order to eliminate short routes from the U.S. Highway System. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved {{the removal of the}} US 140 designation on October 28, 1977. On January 1, 1979, MD 97 was rerouted at Westminster to head north to the Pennsylvania border, replacing US 140. At the Pennsylvania border, the route connected to PA 97, which replaced the US 140 designation in Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the former alignment of MD 97 between Westminster and the Pennsylvania border northwest of Emmitsburg became a part of MD 140. Dualization of MD 97 in Montgomery County was extended further north from MD 28 to MD 108 by 1989. There are plans to build an interchange at the route’s intersection with Randolph Road in order to improve movements for automobiles as well as for pedestrians and bicycles accessing the nearby Glenmont Metro station. Another new interchange was built with MD 200 (Intercounty Connector) north of MD 28 and opened on February 23, 2011.|$|E
50|$|On 8 December 1988, Davidson <b>was</b> <b>decommissioned.</b> She <b>was</b> {{transferred}} to Brazil and commissioned 25 July 1989 as Paraiba (D28). She <b>was</b> <b>decommissioned</b> from the Brazilian Navy on 26 July 2002.|$|R
50|$|Pivot <b>was</b> <b>decommissioned</b> 6 November 1946 at Subic Bay, Philippines. She {{was sold}} to Taiwan 27 August 1948 and renamed ROCS Yung Shou. On 1 July 1970, Yung Shou <b>was</b> <b>decommissioned.</b>|$|R
50|$|The two {{remaining}} squadrons of J 35F were moved in 1973 to F 17 Kallinge {{when the air}} wing <b>was</b> <b>decommissioned.</b> The remaining administrative part of the wing <b>was</b> <b>decommissioned</b> in 1974.|$|R
5|$|In December 2015 the Finnish MoD sent {{a letter}} to Great Britain, France, Sweden and the US informing them that the fighter project had been {{launched}} in the Defence Forces. The goal of the project is to replace the Hornet fleet, which will <b>be</b> <b>decommissioned</b> as of 2025, with multi-role fighters. The project has been named the HX Fighter Program. The JAS-39 is mentioned in the letter as a potential fighter for the program. The request for information concerning the HX Fighter Program was sent in April 2016. The five responses were received in November 2016. The official Request for Quotation will be sent to all five aircraft manufacturers that provided responses to the RFI, through their four governments, in the spring of 2018. The goal is to start the fighter candidates’ environmental testing in Finland in 2019. The buying decision is scheduled to take place in 2021.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of her service during World War II, Alaska was awarded three battle stars. On 30 August Alaska left Okinawa for Japan to {{participate}} in the 7th Fleet occupation force. She arrived in Incheon, Korea on 8 September and supported Army operations there until 26 September, when she left for Tsingtao, China, arriving the following day. There, she supported the 6th Marine Division until 13 November, when she returned to Incheon to take on Army soldiers as part of Operation Magic Carpet, the mass repatriation of millions of American servicemen from Asia and Europe. Alaska left Incheon with a contingent of soldiers bound for San Francisco. After reaching San Francisco, she left for the Atlantic, via the Panama Canal, which she transited on 13 December. The ship arrived in the Boston Navy Yard on 18 December, where preparations were made to place the ship in reserve. She left Boston on 1 February 1946 for Bayonne, New Jersey, where she would be berthed in reserve. She arrived there the following day, and on 13 August, she was removed from active service, though she would not <b>be</b> <b>decommissioned</b> until 17 February 1947.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{contacts}} Sulu, who informs {{them the}} conference is being held at Camp Khitomer. Both ships head for the talks {{as fast as they}} can. As Enterprise nears the planet, Chang's cloaked Bird of Prey moves to intercept. With Enterprise unable to track his ship's position, Chang inflicts severe damage on Enterprise and then Excelsior. At the suggestion of Uhura, the Enterprise's communication officer, Spock and McCoy modify a photon torpedo to home in on the exhaust emissions of Chang's vessel, using equipment originally intended to study gaseous anomalies. The torpedo impact reveals Chang's location, and Enterprise and Excelsior destroy the Bird of Prey with a volley of torpedoes. Crew from both ships beam to the conference and halt an attempt on the Federation president's life. Kirk pleads for those present to continue the peace process. Having saved the peace talks, Enterprise is ordered back to Earth by Starfleet Command to <b>be</b> <b>decommissioned,</b> but the crew decide to take their time on the return voyage. As Enterprise cruises towards a nearby star, Kirk proclaims that though this mission is the final cruise of Enterprise under his command, others will continue their voyages.|$|E
50|$|The 34 Echo class {{submarines}} <b>were</b> <b>decommissioned</b> for scrapping between 1985 and 1995. According to the Federation of American Scientists, one {{or possibly}} two Echo Is <b>were</b> <b>decommissioned</b> {{in the mid-1980s}} and the remaining three or four in 1990. The 29 Echo IIs <b>were</b> all <b>decommissioned</b> by the mid-1990s.|$|R
50|$|In 1988 she <b>was</b> <b>decommissioned</b> and {{transferred}} to the Hellenic Navy, where she served under Hellenic Destroyers Command as a signals intelligence gathering ship. In 2002 she <b>was</b> <b>decommissioned</b> and sold for scrap.|$|R
25|$|The highway stayed {{about the}} same until 1977, when SR344 <b>was</b> <b>decommissioned.</b> SR20 <b>was</b> shifted onto US411 between Rome and Cartersville. SR20's old {{alignment}} was redesignated as part of SR293. A few years later, SR20 Spur in Loganville <b>was</b> <b>decommissioned</b> and redesignated as part of SR81. A decade later, SR20 Spur in Buford <b>was</b> also <b>decommissioned.</b> In {{the middle of the}} decade, SR294N <b>was</b> <b>decommissioned</b> again and redesignated as SR20 Spur. In the mid-2000s, SR20 was extended to Lower Woolsey Road southwest of Hampton.|$|R
5|$|Throughout {{the latter}} half of the 1940s, the various service {{branches}} of the United States had been reducing their inventories from their World War II levels. For the Navy, this resulted in several vessels of various types being decommissioned and either sold for scrap or placed in one of the various United States Navy reserve fleets scattered along the East and West Coast of the United States. As part of this contraction, three of the Iowa-class battleships had been de-activated and decommissioned; however, President Truman refused to allow Missouri to <b>be</b> <b>decommissioned.</b> Against the advice of Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson, Secretary of the Navy John L. Sullivan, and Chief of Naval Operations Louis E. Denfeld, Truman ordered Missouri to be maintained with the active fleet partly because of his fondness for the battleship and partly because the battleship had been christened by his daughter Margaret Truman.|$|E
5|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and the lack of a perceived threat against the United States came drastic cuts to the defense budget and the battleships were deemed uneconomical; as a result, Iowa was decommissioned for the last time on 26 October 1990, after a total of 19 years of commissioned service. She {{was the first of the}} reactivated battleships to <b>be</b> <b>decommissioned,</b> and this was done earlier than originally planned as a result of the damaged turret. Iowa was originally berthed at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and later at Naval Station Newport in Newport, Rhode Island from 24 September 1998 to 8 March 2001, when the ship began her journey under tow to California. The ship arrived in Suisun Bay near San Francisco on 21 April 2001 and joined the reserve fleet there, where she remained in reserve until struck again from the Naval Vessel Register in March 2006. She and her sister ships had been struck previously in 1995. She remained at the Suisun Bay anchorage until November 2011.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, {{plans were}} made for US 140 to <b>be</b> <b>decommissioned,</b> with PA 97 to replace the section in Pennsylvania. This {{proposal}} was made in order to eliminate short routes from the United States Numbered Highways system. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved {{the removal of the}} US 140 designation on October 28, 1977. In December 1978, the borough of Littlestown protested the renumbering of US 140 to PA 97. When the US 140 designation was retired on January 1, 1979, it was replaced by MD 140 from Baltimore to Westminster, and Maryland and Pennsylvania coordinated to have matching routes 97 {{on both sides of the}} state line between Westminster and Gettysburg. The northern terminus of PA 97 was located at the US 15 interchange, while the stretch of the former US 140 north into Gettysburg became unnumbered Baltimore Pike. With this change, the US 140 signs were removed from the square in downtown Gettysburg, and no signs directing motorists to PA 97 were put in their place. This move hurt businesses in the Littlestown area as motorists were unable to get to them without a marked route. The state did put signs directing motorists to PA 97 at the US 15 interchange and at the intersection of US 15 Business and Baltimore Street; however, signs for PA 97 were not placed in the square due to opposition from local officials in Gettysburg who did not want sign clutter in the square. The stretch of Baltimore Pike from the bypass to US 15 Business became State Route 2035 by 1989. PA 97 and the adjacent portion of Baltimore Pike were widened through the US 15 interchange in 2000.|$|E
500|$|On January 1, 1953, the New Jersey State Highway Department {{performed}} a second renumbering of state [...] highways. State Highway Route 25, which had {{run at the}} southern terminus with Route 130, <b>was</b> <b>decommissioned</b> for the sole designation. Since State Highway Route 25 <b>was</b> <b>decommissioned,</b> State Highway Route S-25 would be orphaned and <b>was</b> <b>decommissioned</b> that day. The Highway Department renumbered S-25's alignment to Route 413, which continued as PA413.|$|R
