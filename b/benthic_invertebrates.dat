40|$|In Canada, all {{pulp and}} paper mills need to conduct {{environmental}} effects monitoring (EEM) {{as part of the}} requirements of the Pulp and Paper Effluent Regulations under the Fisheries Act. EEM studies typically consist of a <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> survey, a fish population survey, and an analysis of possible impacts on fish usability. This assessment of Cycle 2 Environmental Effects Monitoring (EEM) data was conducted to determine the type and magnitude of effects occurring on fish and <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> communities on a national scale. The predominant response pattern observed in <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> communities across the country was one of mild to moderate eutrophication, particularly in riverine habitats, although more pronounced eutrophication was observed at a few mills. These response patterns were characterized by increases in abundance and either increases or decreases in taxon richness.

40|$|Oil sand mining {{operations}} in Alberta, Canada produce {{large quantities of}} process water and mature fine tailing (MFT) during the bitumen extraction process. Wet landscape reclamation {{is one of the}} reclamation strategies proposed to utilize process water and MFT in the creation of aquatic reclamation environments that are economically and environmentally acceptable. In the interest of utilizing nutrient enrichment and peat amendment to improve aquatic flora and fauna colonization in new oil sands aquatic reclamation, this microcosm study was designed to assess the phytoplankton and periphyton growth (summer 2008), as well as <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> colonization (summer 2009). Peat amendment significantly increased the growth of phytoplankton and periphyton by providing sufficient nutrients (total nitrogen, total phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon) to the system. In reference wetland, <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> colonization was significantly increased by utilizing sand as bottom substrate and decreased by MFT/Sand mixture as bottom substrate. In OSPM-affected wetland, <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> colonization was not affected by utilizing MFT/Sand as bottom substrate. In comparison to OSPM-affected wetlands, reference wetland had larger number of <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> families and higher total abundance. In this research, experimental microcosms were constructed in three reclamation wetlands with different types of reclamation materials as the bottom substrates (sand, MFT + sand) and amendments (nutrient and/or peat) added to optimize growing conditions for phytoplankton and periphyton, thus creating a biological detrital layer over unfavourable substrates to enhance <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> colonization. The growth estimates of phytoplankton and periphyton on MFT + sand without amendment were low in comparison to the control (water only, no substrate). In comparison to sand, MFT + sand had higher growth estimates at OSPM-affected sites, but lower growth estimates at reference site. The growth estimates of phytoplankton and periphyton on MFT + sand were significantly increased with peat amendment. Nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) enrichment insignificantly improved the phytoplankton and periphyton growth. Peat amendments elevated the concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon in the system and maintained these high concentrations throughout the experiment period. Nutrient enrichment only temporarily (less than 3 weeks) elevated nitrogen and phosphorus levels as the nutrients added were quickly utilized by the system. <b>Benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> colonization was assessed in the following year. Sand treatments had increased total abundance and numbers of families of <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> compared to the mature sediments of the reference wetland. In oil sand process material (OSPM) -affected wetlands, sand treatments had slightly lower abundance and fewer numbers of families in comparison to the mature sediments. In comparison to sand treatments, MFT + sand treatments had decreased total abundance in the reference wetland but not in OSPM-affected wetlands that received MFT input during its construction. Peat amendment and nutrient enrichment had no impact on <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> total abundance or composition. 1 yea...|$|R

40|$|Permafrost thaw {{slumping}} along lakeshores {{in lakes}} of the Mackenzie Delta Uplands, NT {{is known to}} alter water chemistry significantly. Its impact on benthic communities and persistent organic pollutant (POP) behaviour in lakes is not known. <b>Benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> communities responded to slumps through changes to community composition and size spectra. Larger taxa tended to dominate in lakes with slumps. Variability in biomass size spectra was related to total dissolved nitrogen concentration and slump size.

5|$|Fairly {{inactive}} in nature, the Japanese sleeper ray {{spends much}} of its time lying buried on the sea floor. It can produce an electric shock of 30–80 volts to ward off predators, which include the blotchy swell shark (Cephaloscyllium umbratile). Its electric organs are composed of electrocytes, which are specialized cells derived from muscle fibers that are filled with a jelly-like substance. These electrocytes are stacked in vertical columns, with many columns making up each electric organ; this arrangement functions essentially like batteries connected in parallel. The diet of the Japanese sleeper ray includes <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrates.</b> A parasite of this species is the tapeworm Anteropora japonica (Yamaguti, 1934) Subhapradha, 1955.|$|E
5|$|Nocturnal {{and largely}} solitary, the banded houndshark preys on <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrates</b> and bony fishes.

40|$|Floodplain {{connectivity}} {{is important}} to aquatic organisms in large rivers. Anthropogenic alterations regulating the Missouri River have limited connectivity and negatively affected native fauna. Determining the biological response to rare inundation events may be important when considering potential restoration options on a regulated river; thus, we assessed <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> and zooplankton communities at three floodplain sites during a historic Missouri River high-water event. Chironomid larvae dominated during most sampling trips and densities were often highest during initial sampling trips with lower densities as high water persisted. Similar trends were evident for rotifer, cladoceran, and copepod densities. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling also showed relatively high dissimilarity of densities between early and late sampling trips for <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> and zooplankton communities. As such, short-term inundation may be more beneficial to Missouri River <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> (mainly chironomid larvae) and zooplankton production than more prolonged inundation lasting a month or more. Furthermore, restoration projects may be designed at elevations allowing more short-term inundation, which would likely benefit native fishes with additional spawning, nursery, and foraging habitat. Levee setbacks may be an effective restoration option for {{increasing the amount of}} habitat available for short-term inundation while potentially providing socioeconomic, flood-risk reduction benefits by enhancing flow conveyance...|$|R
40|$|Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) is a {{foundation}} species in eastern North America {{where it is}} under threat from the highly invasive, exotic hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae). Eastern hemlock is especially important in riparian areas of Central and Southern Appalachia, so we compared the spatial and temporal composition of benthic collector-gatherers, collector-filterers, and grazers in headwater streams with hemlock-dominated riparian vegetation to those with deciduous tree-dominated riparian vegetation to evaluate {{the extent to which}} adelgid-induced hemlock loss could influence composition and abundance of these two functional feeding groups. We found differences in <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> abundance and family-level diversity based on riparian vegetation and sampling approach, and, often, riparian vegetation significantly interacted with location or season. Collector-gatherers and grazers were more abundant in eastern hemlock streams in the summer, when hemlock litter is readily available and deciduous litter is relatively sparse. Riparian eastern hemlock appears to exert considerable influence on <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> functional feeding group composition in headwater stream communities, as expected with {{a foundation}} species. With the loss of eastern hemlock due to adelgid-induced mortality, we should expect to see alterations in spatial and temporal patterns of <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> abundance and diversity, with potential consequences to both benthic and terrestrial ecosystem function...|$|R

The porcupine ray has long been valued for its rough and durable skin, which {{was made into a}} shagreen leather once used for various utilitarian and ornamental purposes, such as to cover sword hilts and shields. It is caught incidentally by coastal fisheries. Because it must be handled carefully due to its thorns, its commercial significance is limited. Unregulated fishing has led to this species declining in many parts of its range, and thus has been listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Gregarious in nature, {{the pink}} whipray {{has been known}} to form large active and resting aggregations, and {{associate}} with other large ray species.

Across much of its range, substantial numbers of pink whiprays are caught incidentally by a variety of fishing gear and marketed for meat, skin, and cartilage. It is also of importance to ecotourism, being attracted to visitors with bait. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, due to its wide distribution that includes relatively protected areas, such as northern Australia. However, its population in Southeast Asia is likely declining under heavy fishing pressure, and there it has been assessed as Vulnerable.|$|E
40|$|Alluvial springs are an {{interesting}} feature of braided river flood plains. The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify and characterise the fauna and physicochemistry of these springs. The distribution and occurrence of springs was assessed using a GIS analysis in 20 South Island braided rivers. The greatest number of springs was found in east coast inter-montane valleys, 65 % of which were associated with obstructions in the river valley, such as alluvial fans, bluffs or flood retention works. A comparison between springs, hill slope streams and main channels in the upper Waimakariri River revealed physically disparate environments, which were reflected by their invertebrate communities. Springs contained the greatest number of unique taxa, which was attributed to high stability and the presence of phreatic taxa. In spring-sources the presence of aquatic plants were found to be a powerful structuring influence on <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> communities. The generalist, asynchronous nature of New Zealand <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> fauna, and the high diversity and evenness of predatory taxa are also thought to be influential on the high levels of taxonomic richness at spring-sources. Away from the spring-source taxonomic richness decreased due to the decline in stability and habitat complexity. Spring age, or time since major disturbance, was important in structuring <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> communities. Older springs were dominated by non-insect taxa, whereas younger springs, were dominated by insects which are rapid dispersers. A macrophyte manipulation experiment was conducted in four spring-sources. The removal of macrophytes from treatment plots resulted in a decrease in taxa abundance, but an increase in evenness. Mayflies and caddisflies increased, replacing mollusca and diptera. This shift in community composition may have been due to changes in available living space, food resources, flow characteristics and physical structure between the cobble and macrophyte habitats. Springs contributed a major proportion of the <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> biodiversity to the upper Waimakariri River and this study confirms that they deserve commensurate consideration in regional river management planning...|$|R

5|$|Most oil {{pollution}} in the sea comes from cities and industry. Oil is dangerous for marine animals. It can clog the feathers of sea birds, reducing their insulating effect and the birds' buoyancy, or be ingested when they preen themselves {{in an attempt to}} remove the contaminant. Marine mammals are less seriously affected but may be chilled through the removal of their insulation, blinded, dehydrated, or poisoned. <b>Benthic</b> <b>invertebrates</b> are swamped when the oil sinks, fish are poisoned, and the food chain is disrupted. In the short term, oil spills result in wildlife populations being decreased and unbalanced, leisure activities being affected, and the livelihoods of people dependent on the sea being devastated. The marine environment has self-cleansing properties and naturally occurring bacteria will act over time to remove oil from the sea. In the Gulf of Mexico, where oil-eating bacteria are already present, they take only a few days to consume spilt oil.|$|E
5|$|Often found {{lying on}} the bottom buried in sediment, the roughtail {{stingray}} is a generalist predator that feeds {{on a variety of}} <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrates</b> and bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous, with the embryos receiving nourishment initially from yolk, and later from histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. In the northwestern Atlantic, females bear an annual litter of 4–6 young in fall and early winter, after a gestation period of 9–11 months. By contrast, in the Mediterranean there is evidence that females bear two litters of 2–6 young per year after a gestation period of only four months. Rays in the northwestern Atlantic are also larger at birth and at sexual maturity than those from the Mediterranean. The venomous tail spine of the roughtail stingray is potentially dangerous to humans. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern overall and in the northwestern Atlantic, where it is not commercially utilized. However, in the Mediterranean and southwestern Atlantic it is subject to heavy fishing pressure and has been assessed as Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|Starfish are marine invertebrates. They {{typically}} have a central disc and five arms, though some species {{have a larger}} number of arms. The aboral or upper surface may be smooth, granular or spiny, and is covered with overlapping plates. Many species are brightly coloured in various shades of red or orange, while others are blue, grey or brown. Starfish have tube feet operated by a hydraulic system and a mouth at the centre of the oral or lower surface. They are opportunistic feeders and are mostly predators on <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrates.</b> Several species have specialized feeding behaviours including eversion of their stomachs and suspension feeding.
