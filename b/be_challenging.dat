5|$|At {{the end of}} January 2008, on {{the last}} day of the {{transfer}} window, Reid joined Sunderland in a three and a half-year deal worth Â£5m, making the step back up to the Premier League. Sunderland's Greg Halford went in the other direction in a six-month loan spell as part of the deal. Reid explained that he wanted Sunderland to <b>be</b> <b>challenging</b> for European places, and will not be happy fighting relegation season-after-season.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} and classification of AML can <b>be</b> <b>challenging,</b> {{and should be}} performed by a qualified hematopathologist or hematologist. In straightforward cases, the presence of certain morphologic features (such as Auer rods) or specific flow cytometry results can distinguish AML from other leukemias; however, {{in the absence of}} such features, diagnosis may be more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Cecil {{decided the}} game would start {{a day before}} the Parisian cafe {{explosion}} in the original game, filling in some of Nicole Collard's back-story. To this end, Cecil also drafted in the acclaimed comic book artist Dave Gibbons, with whom Revolution worked previously on their 1994 cult classic adventure Beneath a Steel Sky. In addition to working on the visual references for the game, Gibbons also produced a comic book to accompany the game's DS release. Gibbons stated {{that he decided to}} return to video game work on this game because he knew producing character shots with a range of expressions would <b>be</b> <b>challenging,</b> and he knew he would enjoy it, based upon past experience.|$|E
50|$|This is {{the second}} time Vitalstatistix <b>is</b> <b>challenged</b> by a {{contender}} to the leadership of the village, and the first time his leadership <b>is</b> <b>challenged</b> by the population of the village.

30|$|The {{security}} {{challenges in}} IoT systems {{are related to}} security issues arising in the different IoT layers. Physical damage, hardware failure, and power limitations <b>are</b> <b>challenges</b> faced in the physical layer. DoS attacks, sniffing, gateway attacks, and unauthorized access <b>are</b> <b>challenges</b> relevant to the network layer. Malicious code attacks, application vulnerabilities, and software bugs <b>are</b> <b>challenges</b> faced in the application layer [33].|$|R

5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{definitively}} diagnosed from tissue, i.e. it {{is proven}} by biopsy or examination of the tissue excised at surgery. It may be suspected in a patient with obstructive jaundice. Considering it as the working diagnosis may <b>be</b> <b>challenging</b> in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); such patients {{are at high risk}} of developing cholangiocarcinoma, but the symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from those of PSC. Furthermore, in patients with PSC, such diagnostic clues as a visible mass on imaging or biliary ductal dilatation may not be evident.|$|E
5|$|Crushing {{can also}} <b>be</b> <b>challenging.</b> In 2013, the Philippines {{resolved}} to crush their five-ton stockpile, {{in part due}} to environmental objections to a large open fire. They first attempted to use a road roller on the tusks and then on smaller, sawn-off pieces. When that did not work, the pieces were repeatedly smashed with a backhoe bucket. What was left was taken to a crematory. When the United States held a similar event a few months later, they opted to use a large rock crusher; a short time later, France employed a pulverizer to turn its illegal ivory into a powder onto which was then poured a composite material to ensure that none of the ivory could be used.|$|E
5|$|On February 5, 2010, Shimmer {{announced}} {{that after a}} two-year absence, Stock would be returning to the company in April for the tapings of Volumes 29 to 32. Stock returned on April 10 at the tapings of Volume 29, announcing that she would <b>be</b> <b>challenging</b> for the Shimmer Championship on Volume 30, taped later that same day. On Volume 30, MsChif defeated Stock to retain her championship. The following day on Volume 32, Stock defeated {{one half of the}} Shimmer Tag Team Champions, Nicole Matthews, in a singles match.|$|E

50|$|When the Bill of Rights is {{directly}} applied in disputes governed by legislation, conduct must <b>be</b> <b>challenged</b> before law. In other words, {{the implementation of}} the statute must <b>be</b> <b>challenged</b> before the provisions of the statute itself.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{books have}} also <b>been</b> <b>challenged</b> for attacking or disagreeing with {{religious}} truths. On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin has <b>been</b> <b>challenged</b> and suppressed since its publication {{due to its}} groundbreaking theories on Evolution. In 1925, the Butler Act was enacted in Tennessee, banning the teaching of evolutionary theories statewide. Other works, such as the Harry Potter series, have also <b>been</b> <b>challenged</b> thanks to themes that are perceived to promote witchcraft and the occult.|$|R
5|$|Published in 2005, {{producers}} Marc Platt and Adam Siegel optioned Sallis's novel after Siegel read {{a review}} from Publishers Weekly. Adapting the book proved to <b>be</b> <b>challenging</b> for Amini {{as it had}} a nonlinear narrative. Gosling was one of Platt's top casting choices, eventually signing on for the lead as he wanted to star in an action-oriented project. Gosling {{played a pivotal role}} in the film's production, which included hiring Refn as director, and Beth Mickle as production designer. On a production budget of about $15 million, filming commenced on September 25, 2010, shot on location in various parts of Los Angeles, and concluded on November 12.|$|E
5|$|The {{consequence}} of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can <b>be</b> <b>challenging</b> in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, or German. Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities {{that occur in the}} standard English spellings of commonly used words. Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English. Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.|$|E
5|$|The team {{aimed to}} {{replicate}} the playing experience and difficulty of the extant Syndicate. Starbreeze considered {{the difficulty of the}} first game {{to be part of the}} franchise's legacy and was worth preserving; they hoped the new game would <b>be</b> <b>challenging</b> enough for players without being frustrating. They introduced a rarely scripted artificial intelligence (AI) into the game. The AI reacts to players' actions and was programmed to relocate itself after being attacked. The new game has less gore than the older one; players still can kill innocent civilians but the team minimized these scenarios, which they thought were part of the game's environment rather than gameplay elements.|$|E

5|$|There are {{currently}} no therapeutic approaches targeting CASS4, {{and in the}} absence of a catalytic domain and no extracellular moieties, it may <b>be</b> <b>challenging</b> to generate such an agent. However, CASS4 may ultimately be relevant in clinical practice as a possible marker to assess prognosis and outcome in cases of NSCLC (and possibly other types of cancer). At present, its greatest clinical value is likely to be as a predictive variant for severity and onset of Alzheimer's disease and cystic fibrosis.|$|E
5|$|Toothache is {{the most}} common type of {{orofacial}} pain and, when severe, it is considered a dental emergency, since there may be a significant impact on sleep, eating, and other daily activities. It is one of the most common reasons for emergency dental appointments. Correct diagnosis can sometimes <b>be</b> <b>challenging.</b> The treatment of a toothache depends upon the exact cause, and may involve a filling, root canal treatment, extraction, drainage of pus, or other remedial action. The relief of toothache is considered one of the main responsibilities of dentists. In 2013, 223 million cases of tooth pain occurred as a result of dental caries in permanent teeth and 53 million cases occurred in baby teeth. Historically, the demand for treatment of toothache is thought to have led to the emergence of dental surgery as the first specialty of medicine.|$|E
25|$|It can <b>be</b> <b>challenging</b> to {{differentiate}} between low-risk, benign headaches and high-risk, dangerous headaches since symptoms are often similar. Headaches that are possibly dangerous require further lab tests and imaging to diagnose.|$|E

25|$|In late 1989 EastEnders {{acquired}} a new executive producer, Michael Ferguson, {{who took over}} from Mike Gibbon. Ferguson had previously been a producer on ITV's The Bill which seemed to <b>be</b> <b>challenging</b> EastEnders in providing a realistic vision of modern life in London.

25|$|Expanding {{the town}} area has â apart from {{financial}} restrictions â proven to <b>be</b> <b>challenging</b> {{due to its}} geographical location. In southern, eastern and western directions, Windhoek is surrounded by rocky, mountainous areas, which make land development costly. The southern side is not suitable for industrial development {{because of the presence}} of underground aquifers. This leaves the vast Brakwater area north of town the only feasible place for Windhoek's expansion.|$|E
25|$|Volition {{extended}} the game's over-the-top atmosphere and humor into the radio stations via commercials. For example, commercials that promoted Ultor Corporation products served {{to enhance the}} player's sense of the corporation's omnipresence in Stilwater. The radio commercials were recorded with voice actors in the same room, rather than apart, so as to maximize their group dynamism. Many of the in-game commercials went through several drafts and the developers found this writing process to <b>be</b> <b>challenging.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the latter}} part of 1989 EastEnders {{executive}} producer Michael Ferguson, had taken over from Mike Gibbon.
