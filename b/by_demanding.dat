5|$|During {{her stay}} in New York, President Woodrow Wilson ordered {{a number of}} ships of the Atlantic Fleet to Mexican waters in {{response}} to tension created when a detail of Mexican federal troops detained an American gunboat crew at Tampico. The problem was quickly resolved locally, but Rear Admiral Henry T. Mayo sought further redress <b>by</b> <b>demanding</b> an official disavowal of the act by the Huerta regime and a 21-gun salute to the American flag.|$|E
5|$|As the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army made {{preparations}} for its war against Vietnam, state-controlled media in Vietnam sent congratulatory {{messages to the}} Government of the Democratic Kampuchea on {{the second anniversary of}} its establishment, on 17 April 1977. On 30 April 1977, the second anniversary of the fall of Saigon, the Kampuchean reply {{came in the form of}} a military attack against the Vietnamese provinces of An Giang and Châu Đốc, killing hundreds of Vietnamese civilians. The Vietnam People's Army responded by moving its troops to areas attacked by Kampuchea and, on 7 June 1977, Vietnam proposed high-level talks to discuss outstanding issues. On 18 June 1977, the Kampuchean Government replied <b>by</b> <b>demanding</b> that Vietnam remove all of its military units from the disputed areas, and create a demilitarised zone between the opposing forces.|$|E
5|$|Life for Sarah {{during the}} reign of William and Mary was difficult. Although the new King and Queen had awarded Sarah’s husband the title Earl of Marlborough, Sarah and John enjoyed {{considerably}} less favour than they had {{during the reign}} of James II. The new Earl of Marlborough had supported the now exiled James; and by this time Sarah’s influence on Anne, and her cultivation of high members of the government to promote Anne’s interests, was widely known. Mary II responded to this <b>by</b> <b>demanding</b> that Anne dismiss Sarah. However, Anne refused. This created a rift between Mary and Anne that never healed.|$|E

5|$|McCarthy's {{judicial}} career attracted {{some controversy}} {{because of the}} speed with which he dispatched many of his cases as he worked to clear the heavily backlogged docket he had inherited. Wisconsin had strict divorce laws, but when McCarthy heard divorce cases, he expedited them whenever possible, and he made the needs of children involved in contested divorces a priority. When it came to other cases argued before him, McCarthy compensated for his lack of experience as a jurist <b>by</b> <b>demanding</b> and relying heavily upon precise briefs from the contesting attorneys. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed a low percentage of the cases he heard, but he was also censured in 1941 for having lost evidence in a price fixing case.|$|E
5|$|To reach a {{complete}} peace Thurisind had first {{to deal with}} Ildigis who had found hospitality at Thurisind's court. Audoin demanded yet again to have him turned in, and Justinian joined in the request. Thurisind, despite his reluctance to resume the war with both Audoin and Justinian, {{did not want to}} openly breach the rules of hospitality and thus tried to evade the request <b>by</b> <b>demanding</b> in his turn to have Ostrogotha given to him; in the end, to avoid both openly giving in {{and at the same time}} renewing the war, both kings murdered their respective guests but kept secret their involvement in the act.|$|E
5|$|By the afternoon, the {{majority}} of Soyuz members favoured an immediate vote. The Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Anatoly Lukyanov, had already departed for Novo Ogarevo {{to take part in}} constitutional negotiations and he promised to tell Gorbachev about the vote. In his place stood Ivan Laptev, a pro-Gorbachev reformer, who did not trust Lukyanov and tried to stall the vote <b>by</b> <b>demanding</b> a statement from the KGB, Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence. According to Laptev, the mood was such that if a vote had been taken Pavlov would have won. At the time, both the Soviet secret police and the military establishment in general wanted to strengthen the authority of the Soviet Government and so they too supported Pavlov's program. Soyuz, through a vote, was able to increase the powers of the Cabinet of Ministers, and gave the institution the right of legislative initiative.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{approval}} of the new Constitution, the 2009 general election was called. The opposition sought to delay the election <b>by</b> <b>demanding</b> a new biometric registry system, hoping that it would give them time to form a united front against MAS. Many MAS activists reacted violently against the demands, and attempting to prevent this. Morales went on a five-day hunger strike in April 2009 to push the opposition to rescind their demands. He also agreed to allow for the introduction of a new voter registry, but insisted that it was rushed through so as not to delay the election. Morales and the MAS won with a landslide majority, polling 64.2%, while voter participation had reached an all-time high of 90%. His primary opponent, Reyes Villa, gained 27% of the vote. The MAS won a two-thirds majority in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Morales notably increased his support in the east of the country, with MAS gaining a majority in Tarija.|$|E
5|$|Julius II, having secured his own {{control of}} the Papal armies by arresting and imprisoning Cesare, first in Rome and later in Madrid, quickly moved to re-establish Papal control over the Romagna <b>by</b> <b>demanding</b> that Venice return the cities she had seized. The Republic of Venice, {{although}} willing to acknowledge Papal sovereignty over these port cities along the Adriatic coast and willing to pay Julius II an annual tribute, refused to surrender the cities themselves. In response, Julius concluded an alliance with France and the Holy Roman Empire against Venice; the death of Isabella I of Castile and the resulting collapse of relations between the parties soon dissolved the alliance, but not before Venice had been induced to abandon several of the cities. Julius, although unsatisfied with his gains, did not himself possess sufficient forces to fight the Republic; {{for the next two}} years he instead occupied himself with the reconquest of Bologna and Perugia, which, located between Papal and Venetian territory, had in the meantime assumed a status of quasi-independence.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{took steps}} to remove a group of bishops he {{regarded}} {{as a threat to}} his rule. The royal administration under Henry I had been headed by Roger, the Bishop of Salisbury, supported by Roger's nephews, Alexander and Nigel, the Bishops of Lincoln and Ely respectively, and Roger's son, Roger le Poer, who was the Lord Chancellor. These bishops were powerful landowners as well as ecclesiastical rulers, and they had begun to build new castles and increase the size of their military forces, leading Stephen to suspect that they were about to defect to the Empress Matilda. Roger and his family were also enemies of Waleran, who disliked their control of the royal administration. In June 1139, Stephen held his court in Oxford, where a fight between Alan of Brittany and Roger's men broke out, an incident probably deliberately created by Stephen. Stephen responded <b>by</b> <b>demanding</b> that Roger and the other bishops surrender all of their castles in England. This threat was backed up by the arrest of the bishops, with the exception of Nigel who had taken refuge in Devizes Castle; the bishop only surrendered after Stephen besieged the castle and threatened to execute Roger le Poer. The remaining castles were then surrendered to the King.|$|E

5|$|With the {{annexation}} of the Kingdom of Kandy in 1815 the British brought the whole island of Ceylon {{under their control}} and in 1829 appointed the Colebrooke–Cameron Commission to assess {{the administration of the}} island. Among the recommendations of the commission were the end of the separate administration along ethnic/cultural lines for Low Country Sinhalese, Kandyan Sinhalese and Tamils and the introduction of communal representation whereby Ceylonese members of the Legislative Council were appointed along ethnic lines. The Donoughmore Commission of 1931 introduced universal suffrage and replaced communal representation with territorial representation, thereby introducing majority (Sinhalese) rule. Following the 1936 state council election an all-Sinhalese Board of Ministers was established, stoking fears amongst the island's minorities about Sinhalese domination. Ceylon's Tamils, led by G. G. Ponnambalam, responded <b>by</b> <b>demanding</b> balanced representation (half of seats in legislature for Sinhalese with the remaining half for the combined minorities). When the British appointed Soulbury Commission to look into constitutional reform in 1944, Ceylon's Tamils formed the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) to represent Tamil interests.|$|E

40|$|Is {{the onset}} of {{fertility}} decline caused by structural socioeconomic changes, as affirmed <b>by</b> <b>demand</b> theory, or <b>by</b> the transmission of new ideas, as argued by ideation theory?

Massive economic growth started around 1955, while big measurable ideational changes (the establishment of an aggressive official Family Planning Program and large improvements in {{the legal status of}} women) took place in 1967. The 1977 Iran Fertility Survey was carried out at just the right moment to separate these effects. We argue that the Iranian marital fertility decline is better described <b>by</b> <b>demand</b> theory than <b>by</b> ideation theory.
