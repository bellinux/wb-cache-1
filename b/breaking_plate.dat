The paperis focused on theoretic and experimental researches effectuated on any profiles with Coanda effect,which are followed with the patenting of three similar profiles. In the frame of theoretical researches the molecular attraction forces of adhesion and cohesion in thenumerical integration of viscous fluid flow around a <b>breaking</b> <b>plate</b> even to the angle of 45 o areintroduced, highlighting the advantageous Henri Coanda effect. The experimental researches are effectuated on a profile with Coanda effect, measuring with atwo-component strain gauge balance the lift and aerodynamic drag forces for different profile attackangle, highlighting the increasing of the attack angle from the usual value of 11 o to over the 27 o forthat profile when the flow separation takes place...|$|E

50|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of interest include the thickness and mechanical strength required of the substrate. In some formats, such as suspended stripline and finline, it is advantageous {{to make the}} substrate as thin as possible. Delicate semiconductor components mounted on a flexing substrate can become damaged. A hard, rigid material such as quartz might be chosen as the substrate to avoid this problem, rather than an easier to machine board. In other formats, such as homogeneous stripline, it can be much thicker. For printed antennae, that are conformal to the device shape, flexible, hence very thin, substrates are required. Thickness required for electrical performance depends on the permittivity of the material. Surface finish is an issue; some roughness {{may be required to}} ensure adhesion of the metallisation, but too much causes conductor losses. Thermal properties can be important. Thermal expansion changes the electrical {{properties of}} lines and can <b>break</b> <b>plated</b> through holes.|$|R

40|$|Orion and Commercial Crew Program (CCP) Partners {{have chosen}} to use {{frangible}} joints for certain separation events. The joints currently available are zero failure tolerant and {{will be used in}} mission safety applications. The goal is to further develop a NASA designed redundant frangible joint that will lower flight risk and increase reliability. FY 16 testing revealed a successful design in subscale straight test specimens that gained efficiency and supports Orion load requirements. Approach / Innovation A design constraint is that the redundant joint must fit within the current Orion architecture, without the need for additional vehicle modification. This limitation required a design that changed the orientation of the expanding tube assemblies (XTAs), by rotating them 90 deg from the standard joint configuration. The change is not trivial and affects the fracture mechanism and structural load paths. To address these changes, the design incorporates cantilevered arms on the <b>break</b> <b>plate.</b> The shock transmission and expansion of the XTA applies force to these arms and creates a prying motion to push the plate walls outward to the point of structural failure at the notched section. The 2014 test design revealed that parts could slip during functioning wasting valuable energy needed to separate the structure with only a single XTA functioning. Dual XTA functioning fully separated the assembly showing a discrepancy can be backed up with redundancy. Work on other fully redundant systems outside NASA is limited to a few patents that have not been subjected to functionality testing Design changes to prevent unwanted slippage (with ICA funding in 2015) showed success with a single XTA. The main goal for FY 2016 was to send the new Flat H RFJ to WSTF where single XTA test failures occurred back in 2014. The plan was to gain efficiency in this design by separating the Flat H RFJ with thicker ligaments with dimensions baselined in 2014. Other modifications included geometry changes to better disperse loads paths and to minimize air gaps. The design additionally added more structural strength to enhance the structural limits in static loads testing. The design also implemented a smoother load line through the assembly. Results / Knowledge Gained The new Flat H RFJ successfully fractured at WSTF with thicker ligaments and lower cord size. Where failure to separate occurred earlier, there is now excessive energy available for structural separation. The new challenge to provide some structural support to prevent secondary fracturing of the <b>break</b> <b>plate</b> remains to be completed. This future work is being funded by the JSC Engineering Directorate in 2017 to elevate the TRL on curved Flat H RFJs that configure with the Orion Service Panel Separation. Additional funding from JSC Engineering will provide new design testing to avoid secondary fracturing...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{theory of}} plate {{tectonics}} {{describes how the}} surface of the Earth is split into an organized jigsaw of seven large plates 1 of similar sizes and a population of smaller plates, whose areas follow a fractal distribution 2, 3. The reconstruction of global tectonics during the past 200 My 4 suggests that this layout is probably a long-term feature of our planet, but the forces governing it are unknown. Previous studies 3, 5, 6, primarily based on statistical properties of plate distributions, were unable to resolve how the size of plates is determined by lithosphere properties and/or underlying mantle convection. Here, we demonstrate that the plate layout of the Earth is produced by a dynamic feedback between mantle convection and the strength of the lithosphere. Using 3 D spherical models of mantle convection with plate-like behaviour that match the plate size-frequency distribution observed for Earth, we show that subduction geometry drives the tectonic fragmentation that generates plates. The spacing between slabs controls the layout of large plates, and the stresses caused by the bending of trenches, <b>break</b> <b>plates</b> into smaller fragments. Our results explain why the fast evolution in small back-arc plates 7, 8 reflects the dramatic changes in plate motions during times of major reorganizations. Our study opens the way to use convection simulations with plate-like behaviour to unravel how global tectonics and mantle convection are dynamically connected...|$|R
