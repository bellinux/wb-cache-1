40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify the effect of lifting height and mass lifted on the peak low <b>back</b> <b>load</b> in terms of net moments, compression forces and anterior-posterior shear forces. Ten participants had to lift a box using four handle heights. Low back loading was quantified using a dynamic 3 -D linked segment model and a detailed electromyographic driven model of the trunk musculature. The effects of lifting height and lifting mass were quantified using a regression technique (GEE) for correlated data. Results indicate that an increase in lifting height and a decrease in lifting mass were related to a decrease in low <b>back</b> <b>load.</b> It is argued that trunk flexion is a major contributor to low <b>back</b> <b>load.</b> For ergonomic interventions it can be advised to prioritise optimisation of the vertical location of the load to be lifted rather than decreasing the mass of the load for handle heights between 32 cm and 155 cm, and for load masses between 7. 5 and 15 kg.

40|$|Manual {{materials}} handling on a moving platform, like a ship, {{might be a}} risk factor for the development of low back pain due to the influence of accelerations on low <b>back</b> <b>loading.</b> In the current simulation study, 3 -D accelerations, measured on a frigate were applied to the kinematics of symmetrical and asymmetrical lifting movements and to a pulling task that had been performed under stable conditions. The aim was to find out to what extent low <b>back</b> <b>loading</b> is increased when the task execution is not adapted to the ship accelerations. Unfavorable timing, analyzed using the 99 th percentile of predicted low back moments, resulted in only a moderate (up to 15 %) increase of extending and total low back moments, and in a substantial increase of the twisting moment (up to 67 %) during asymmetrical lifting. Moments in the pulling task were low and were relatively unaffected by ship accelerations, but adaptation of the movement pattern to prevent falling would be needed more often than during lifting. It furthermore appeared that a substantial reduction of low <b>back</b> <b>loading</b> by favorable timing is not a realistic option. Designing tasks {{in such a way that}} they are located midship would reduce the 99 th percentile of predicted low back moments. During lifting, orienting the task in such a way that the feet are pointing sideward relative to the ship reduces the predicted peak twisting moment at the low back compared to pointing the feet forward or backward. Relevance to industry: Accelerations on a ship may influence safety and loading of workers during manual {{materials handling}}. This study investigates potential effects of moderate accelerations on low <b>back</b> <b>loading</b> during lifting and pulling tasks.

Purpose: To compare the prevalence of symptoms of low back pain (LBP) among former endurance athletes with different loading characteristics on the lumbar region: cross-country skiing (flexion loading), rowing (extension loading), and orienteering (no specific loading), as well as a nonathletic control group. Conclusion: Low back pain was not more common among former endurance athletes with specific <b>back</b> <b>loading</b> compared with non-athletes. The results indicate that years of prolonged and repetitive flexion or extension loading in endurance sports does not lead to more LBP. However, a large training volume in the past year and previous episodes with LBP are risk factors for LBP.

40|$|Summary The {{application}} of artificial loads to mammals and birds {{has been used}} to provide insight into the mechanics and energetic cost of terrestrial locomotion. However, only two species of bird have previously been used in loading experiments, the cursorial guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) and the locomotor-generalist barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis). Here, using respirometry and treadmill locomotion, we investigate the energetic cost of carrying trunk loads in a diving bird, the tufted duck (Aythya fuligula). Attachment of <b>back</b> <b>loads</b> equivalent to 10 % and 20 % of body mass increased the metabolic rate during locomotion (7. 94 % and 15. 92 %, respectively) while sternal loads of 5 % and 10 % had a greater proportional effect than the <b>back</b> <b>loads</b> (metabolic rate increased by 7. 19 % and 13. 99 %, respectively). No effect on locomotor kinematics was detected during any load carrying experiments. These results concur with previous reports of load carrying economy in birds, in that there is a less than proportional relationship between increasing load and metabolic rate (found previously in guinea fowl), while {{application of}} sternal loads causes an approximate doubling of metabolic rate compared to <b>back</b> <b>loads</b> (reported in an earlier study of barnacle geese). The increase in cost when carrying sternal loads may result from having to move this extra mass dorso-ventrally during respiration. Disparity in load carrying economy between species may arise from anatomical and physiological adaptations to different forms of locomotion, such as the varying uncinate process morphology and hindlimb tendon development in goose, guinea fowl and duck...|$|R

One-piece and two-piece type chairs have an important advantage in comparison with control samples, if only the front to <b>back</b> <b>load</b> is noted. The comparisons with custom chairs very clearly show the superior performance of the curved frames of one-piece type and two-piece type chairs. The high load at front to back was obtained with the curved frames, especially for one-piece type chairs. The front to back loads of first, two-piece type chairs, and custom chairs are equal to 1.72 E 3, 1.42 E 3, and 1.02 E 3  N, respectively.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} develop, compare and {{validate}} {{two versions of}} a video analysis method for assessment of low back moments during occupational lifting tasks since for epidemiological studies and ergonomic practice relatively cheap and easily applicable methods to assess low <b>back</b> <b>loads</b> are needed. Ten healthy subjects participated in a protocol comprising 12 lifting conditions. Low back moments were assessed using two variants of a video analysis method and a lab-based reference method. Repeated measures ANOVAs showed no overall differences in peak moments between the {{two versions of the}} video analysis method and the reference method. However, two conditions showed a minor overestimation of one of the video analysis method moments. Standard deviations were considerable suggesting that errors in the video analysis were random. Furthermore, there was a small underestimation of dynamic components and overestimation of the static components of the moments. Intraclass correlations coefficients for peak moments showed high correspondence (> 0. 85) of the video analyses with the reference method. It is concluded that, when a sufficient number of measurements can be taken, the video analysis method for assessment of low <b>back</b> <b>loads</b> during lifting tasks provides valid estimates of low back moments in ergonomic practice and epidemiological studies for lifts up to a moderate level of asymmetry...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to quantify the relative effect of the magnitude and direction of the exerted push force and of trunk inclination on the mechanical load at the low back using a regression analysis for correlated data. In addition, we explored the effects of handle height and type of pushing activity (standing or walking) on the magnitude and direction of exerted forces, trunk inclination, and low back loading when pushing a four-wheeled cart on a treadmill. An experimental setup was designed in which nine participants pushed a four-wheeled cart on a treadmill. Kinematics and reaction forces on the hand were measured to calculate the net moment at the L 5 -S 1 intervertebral disc. Results show that the magnitude and direction of the exerted push force and the trunk inclination significantly and independently affect low <b>back</b> <b>load.</b> It is concluded that for the ergonomic evaluation of pushing tasks, the inclination of the trunk should be considered, in addition to the magnitude and direction of exerted forces. Relevance to industry: Pushing carts is a common activity for a considerable part of the workforce and has been associated with musculoskeletal complaints.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyse the effect of posture on the {{relation}} between EMG amplitude and moment of the back muscles in different subjects, in order to gain a better insight into the possibilities of EMG as a means of measuring individual <b>back</b> <b>load.</b> Eight healthy subjects participated in the experiments. Isometric back extensions were performed in three postures: upright standing, standing with the spine flexed, and upright sitting. In each posture the lumbar moments of three maximal voluntary contractions were measured and then exertions of 10 to 90 % of maximal voluntary contraction (increments of 10) were performed. EMG signals from the back muscles were recorded with four pairs of surface electrodes located 3 cm and 6 cm lateral to the midline of the spine at the L 3 level. EMG signals were full-wave rectified and averaged over 2 s intervals of constant moment. The results show that posture has a considerable influence on the relationship between EMG and the lumbar moment. Besides this, large individual differences and an influence of electrode position on the relationship were found. Therefore it is concluded that whenever EMG is to be used as a means to measure individual <b>back</b> <b>load,</b> a calibration of the EMG amplitude to lumbar moment ratio is necessary for each subject, each electrode position, and each posture. Interpretation of EMG amplitudes has to be done on an individual basis and taking influences of posture and electrode location on the EMG-lumbar moment relationship into account...|$|E
