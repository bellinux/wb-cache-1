5|$|All three {{consoles}} provide titles {{from older}} consoles for download; the Xbox 360 through the Xbox Originals service, the PlayStation 3 through the PlayStation Store, and the Wii through the Virtual Console. When purchased, {{the game is}} saved to console's internal memory or, optionally on the Wii, to an inserted SD/SDHC card. Initially the Xbox 360 also provided Xbox Live support for <b>backwards</b> <b>compatible</b> games, but the service has since been discontinued for original Xbox games. No more games {{will be added to}} the list of <b>backwards</b> <b>compatible</b> games for the Xbox 360. In response to the lack of backward compatibility for most PS3s, many popular games have been released for download as PlayStation 2 Classics and other popular series have been updated with gameplay/graphics as high-definition remasters for PlayStation consoles and have been released on Blu-ray Disc or are available for download on the PlayStation Network.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{compelling}} features of the AIT format is that many generations are both <b>backwards</b> and forwards <b>compatible.</b> This allows multiple generations of tape drives to both read and write to multiple generations of tape media.|$|R
50|$|The {{most widely}} used office {{productivity}} packages currently rely on various proprietary and reverse engineered binary file formats such as those created by successive releases of Microsoft Word, PowerPoint and Excel. However, OOXML is a new format which is not <b>backwards</b> or forwards <b>compatible</b> {{with any of the}} old Microsoft Office formats.|$|R
5000|$|The {{open source}} BSD {{licensed}} VHDL code for the J2 core {{has been proven}} on Xilinx FPGAs and on ASICs manufactured on TSMC's 180 nm process, and is capable of booting µClinux. [...] J2 is <b>backwards</b> ISA <b>compatible</b> with SH-2, implemented as a 5-stage pipeline with separate Instruction and Data memory interfaces, and a machine generated Instruction Decoder supporting the densely packed and complex (relative to other RISC machines) ISA. Additional instructions are easy to add. J2 implements instructions for dynamic shift (using the SH-3 and later instruction patterns), extended atomic operations (used for threading primitives) and locking/interfaces for symmetric multiprocessor support. Plans to implement the SH-2A (as [...] "J2+") and SH-4 (as [...] "J4") instruction sets as the relevant patents expire in 2016-2017.|$|R
5|$|DAB+ is a {{major upgrade}} to DAB, widely used in other {{countries}} in Europe. It was first tested in the United Kingdom in 2013 before regular services were launched in 2016. DAB+ is not <b>backwards</b> <b>compatible</b> with DAB so older radios cannot receive DAB+ stations. There are no plans {{in the foreseeable future}} {{for the vast majority of}} BBC and commercial stations to transition from DAB to DAB+. Estimates given by multiplex operator Switch Digital suggests that a third of radio sets in 2016 were DAB+ compatible.|$|E
5|$|Each console has {{a variety}} of games. Most games {{released}} on the original PlayStation are <b>backwards</b> <b>compatible</b> and can be played directly on its successors, the PlayStation 2, PSX and PlayStation 3. Some of these games can also be played on the PlayStation Portable but they must be purchased and downloaded from a list of PS one Classics from the PlayStation Store. Games released on the PlayStation 2 can currently only be played on the original console as well as the PSX and the early models of the PlayStation 3 which are <b>backwards</b> <b>compatible.</b> The PlayStation 3 has two types of games, those released on Blu-ray Discs and downloadable games from the PlayStation Store. The PlayStation Portable consists of numerous games available on both its physical media, the Universal Media Disc and the Digital Download from the PlayStation Store. However, some games are only available on the UMD while others are only available on the PlayStation Store. The PlayStation Vita consists of games available on both its physical media, the PlayStation Vita card and digital download from the PlayStation Store.|$|E
5|$|Both episodes were {{released}} for PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows on 13 April 2010 in North America and on 16 April 2010 in Europe. Grand Theft Auto IV: The Complete Edition, including the original Grand Theft Auto IV and its two episodic expansions, was listed on online stores, before being confirmed by Rockstar. The compilation {{was released on}} PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Windows on 26 October 2010 in North America, and 29 October in Europe. The Xbox 360 versions of both episodes were made <b>backwards</b> <b>compatible</b> with the Xbox One on 9 February 2017.|$|E
40|$|International audienceHuman newborns {{discriminate}} languages {{from different}} rhythmic classes, fail to discriminate languages {{from the same}} rhythmic class, and fail to discriminate languages when the utterances are played backwards. Recent evidence showing that cotton-top tamarins discriminate Dutch from Japanese, but not when utterances are played <b>backwards,</b> is <b>compatible</b> with the hypothesis that rhythm discrimination {{is based on a}} general perceptual mechanism inherited from a primate ancestor. The present study further explores the rhythm hypothesis for language discrimination by testing languages from the same and different rhythmic class. We find that tamarins discriminate Polish from Japanese (different rhythmic classes), fail to discriminate English and Dutch (same rhythmic class), and fail to discriminate backwards utterances from different and same rhythmic classes. These results provide further evidence that language discrimination in tamarins is facilitated by rhythmic differences between languages, and suggest that, in humans, this mechanism is unlikely to have evolved specifically for language...|$|R
5000|$|RadioShack relaunched the ZipZaps Micro RC line {{under the}} XMODS banner on October 2008. Aside {{from the new}} labels that bear the XMODS Micro RC logo, the {{packaging}} {{is similar to the}} ZipZaps line. All parts, (motors, wheel covers, bodies, etc.) are <b>backwards</b> and forwards <b>compatible</b> between Zipzaps and XMODS Micro, {{with the exception of the}} 2009 models, which have one-piece wheels that do not allow the swapping of wheel covers. However, all other ZipZap and XMODS Micro parts will fit on the 2009 chassis. The cars use the traditional box-type controller, as opposed to the gun-type controller of the ZipZaps SE line.

5|$|Items such as Body Armor (which reduce damage taken), health packs (which heal players), and Damage Amplifiers are {{scattered}} across levels. Levels {{are set in}} a variety of environments, including spaceships, outposts, and buildings such as castles and monasteries. Many contain features such as elevators (lifts) and teleporters, and obstacles such as water and lava. The game is <b>backwards</b> <b>compatible</b> with the majority of Unreal multiplayer maps. The PC version includes a level editor in which players can create their own levels, and the PlayStation 2 version supports the use of a USB keyboard and mouse, enabling players to play in a similar manner to the PC version.|$|E
5|$|Early {{models of}} the Wii are fully <b>backwards</b> <b>compatible</b> with GameCube {{software}} {{and most of its}} accessories; the Wii Family Edition and the Wii Mini iterations lack GameCube support. Early versions of the PlayStation 3 and all {{models of the}} Xbox 360 only offer partial support and use software emulation for backwards compatibility. Current versions of the PS3 do not offer PlayStation 2 compatibility, though PS1 compatibility is retained. Some models of the first generation of the PS3 offered full backwards compatibility for PS2 games. The Xbox 360's compatibility is increased through game-specific patches automatically downloaded from Xbox Live or downloaded and burned to a CD or DVD from the Xbox website and the PS3's compatibility is expanded with firmware updates.|$|E
25|$|All {{versions}} of WMA released since version 9.0 - namely 9.1, 9.2 and 10 - have been <b>backwards</b> <b>compatible</b> {{with the original}} v9 decoder and are therefore not considered separate codecs. The sole exception to this is the WMA 10 Professional codec whose Low Bit Rate (LBR) mode is only <b>backwards</b> <b>compatible</b> with the older WMA Professional decoders at half sampling rate (similar to how HE-AAC is <b>backwards</b> <b>compatible</b> with AAC-LC). Full fidelity decoding of WMA 10 Professional LBR bitstreams requires a WMA version 10 or newer decoder.|$|E
500|$|PlayStation 4 Pro or PS4 Pro {{for short}} (originally {{announced}} under the codename Neo) was unveiled on September 7, 2016. Its model number is CUH-7000. It is {{an updated version}} of the PlayStation 4 with improved hardware, including an upgraded GPU with 4.2 teraflops of processing power, and higher CPU clock. It is designed primarily to enable selected games to be playable at 4K resolution, and improved quality for PlayStation VR. All games are <b>backwards</b> and forward <b>compatible</b> between PS4 and PS4 Pro, but games with optimizations will have improved graphics performance on PS4 Pro. Although capable of streaming 4K video from online sources, PS4 Pro does not support Ultra HD Blu-ray. [...] Additionally the PS4 Pro is the only PS4 model which can remote play at 1080p. The other models are limited to 720p.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{chapter is}} {{dedicated}} to discussing the engineering aspects involved in the integration of modeling languages, as {{an essential part of}} the globalization process. It covers the foundations of language integration, the definition of the relationships between the languages to be integrated, and the various dimensions of language and tool integration. Language variants, evolution, refactoring and retirement are also discussed, as key issues involved in the globalization of modeling languages. Today's software development is characterized by a large degree of improvisation: di↵erent languages and language-based tools are used to create di↵erent artifacts that act on the same (physical or logical) system. Such multiplicity is not a problem in itself, but rather the common situation of those languages and tools to be insuciently integrated. The languages and tools though involve interaction at the system level and these interactions are hard to understand without good integration. In fact, the actual interactions may disagree with the intended interactions. Any analysis or verification is going to be hard. Excessive testing may be needed and still fail to be conclusive. We just may hope for the engineers collaborating on the same system to limit themselves to a set of languages implemented with a single language workbench. Version changes of languages and tools would be semantics preserving (both <b>backwards</b> and forward <b>compatible)</b> and therefore not require any changes to the current artifacts...|$|R
40|$|Low {{power sensor}} {{networks}} {{have traditionally been}} regarded as not having the capabilities required to connect them to the internet. New research into the Internet of Things has challenged this concept and is opening up new possibilities for sensor network capabilities. Environmental sensor networks are {{just one of the}} areas which will greatly benefit from this connectivity improvement. However, there are many challenges to be solved in order to make full and efficient use of these advancements. One of the major challenges which has been identified is the lack of connectivity when sensors are in low power sleep states. Previous solutions for low power devices have relied on application layer gateways to proxy communications to the sensors, but this restricts the flexibility of the network as it is limited to the capabilities of the proxy. Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) offers a solution to this problem by allowing sensors to respond and handle communications at their convenience. This thesis presents and evaluates a novel method and implementation of Delay Tolerant Networking using IPv 6 extension headers. The proposed DTN extension header is found to have a significantly lower packet size overhead than other DTN protocols. In addition, the protocol and systems to support it are entirely <b>backwards</b> and forwards <b>compatible</b> with the existing internet infrastructure allowing for it to be incorporated into existing deployments. The developed protocol forms a new state of the art for DTN on constrained sensor networks using end to end IP connectivity. Using this, a new range of low power IoT devices can be developed, featuring long battery lives and reliable connectivity...|$|R

25|$|It was {{announced}} on November 9, 2015 that Black Ops would become <b>backwards</b> <b>compatible</b> with the Xbox One. It was originally {{meant to be}} available for backwards compatibility in December 2015, but the date was later changed to some time in 2016. Black Ops was originally the sixth-most requested Xbox 360 title to become <b>backwards</b> <b>compatible</b> with the Xbox One. On May 17, 2016, the game was made available through Xbox One's backward compatibility. Shortly after, {{it was reported that}} sales of the Xbox 360 version had increased by 13,000 percent.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{previous}} Nintendo home consoles, the Switch is region-free, allowing {{players to}} use cartridges or downloaded content from {{any part of}} the world, though Nintendo recommends using the appropriate regional eShop for digital purposes for obtaining the best post-purchase support if needed. Further, eShop purchases, while still tied to the Nintendo Account, are not tied to the specific Switch console, as was the case for previous Nintendo hardware. Once the user re-registers their account to a Switch, they have access to download all previous purchases; however, a user can only have their account registered on one console at a time, and downloaded software tied to an account cannot be used if that account is not registered to the device. The Switch does not support optical discs and is not <b>backwards</b> <b>compatible</b> with the 3DS and Wii U game media. The Switch is not <b>backwards</b> <b>compatible</b> with other digital titles from previous consoles. The console also did not launch with the Virtual Console, which provided digital versions of physically released games from past Nintendo consoles, but the company said this feature may be added later. Kimishima said that the Switch is powerful enough to emulate titles from previous Nintendo consoles, but currently does not support controllers or controller emulation for these titles.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Sony {{announced}} {{the successor to}} the PlayStation, the PlayStation 2, which is <b>backwards</b> <b>compatible</b> with the PlayStation's DualShock controller and games, and launched the console in 2000. The last PS one units were sold in winter 2004 before it was officially discontinued in March 2005, {{for a total of}} 102 million units shipped since its launch 10 years earlier. Games for the PlayStation continued to sell until Sony ceased production of PlayStation games on 23 March 2006 – over 11 years after it had been released, and less than a year before the debut of the PlayStation 3.|$|E
25|$|The third {{generation}} of the PlayStation, the PlayStation 3, was launched on 11 November 2006 in Japan, 17 November 2006 in North America, and 23 March 2007 in Europe. The backward compatibility of the PlayStation 3 differs by model. The newer PlayStation 3 models, like the Slim, are only <b>backwards</b> <b>compatible</b> with original PlayStation games; however, the older 60 GB model (the first PS3 model released) will play PlayStation and PlayStation 2 games through either having the Emotion Engine and/or Reality Synthesizer and emulating one or the other. While PlayStation 3 games are not region-locked, PlayStation and PlayStation 2 games are only playable on PlayStation 3 consoles from the same region.|$|E
