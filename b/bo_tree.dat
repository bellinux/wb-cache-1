It {{does not have a}} statute of the deity; instead it holds a Yantra, a spiritual drawing of the deity's power. Of all the shrines in the complex, it is the largest and the first that all pilgrims come to visit. Although it does not have a representation of the deity, kept in an adjoining room is a statue of Shiva also known amongst Sinhalese as Karanduva. Within it there is a clay arm chair known as Kalana Mandima that supposedly belonged to Kalyanagiri Swamy. It is covered by a leopard’s skin and on it has all the ceremonial instruments. To the left of the main shrine lies a smaller shrine dedicated to Hindu god Ganesha who is known as Ganapatidevio amongst Sinhalese. Tamils refer to him as the Manica Pillaiyar as well. It too is a small rectangular building without any decoration. To the left of Ganesha shrine stands the Vishnu Devale the shrine dedicated to Vishnu within which there is also a Buddha image.

25|$|Bonsai {{cultivation}} {{and care}} involves the long-term cultivation of small trees in containers, called bonsai in the Japanese tradition of this art form. Similar practices exist in other Japanese art forms {{and in other}} cultures, including saikei (Japanese), penjing (Chinese), and hòn non <b>bộ</b> (Vietnamese). <b>Trees</b> are difficult to cultivate in containers, which restrict root growth, nutrition uptake, and resources for transpiration (primarily soil moisture). In addition to the root constraints of containers, bonsai trunks, branches, and foliage are extensively shaped and manipulated to meet aesthetic goals. Specialized tools and techniques are used to protect the health and vigor of the subject tree. Over time, the artistic manipulation of small trees in containers {{has led to a}} number of cultivation and care approaches that successfully meet the practical and the artistic requirements of bonsai and similar traditions.|$|R

40|$|Increased {{expression}} of several acute phase cytokines, such as IL 1, IL 8 and TNF-α, have been {{positively correlated with}} the most severe clinical symptoms often associated with coliform or endotoxin-induced mastitis. Very little information is available on buffalo transcriptome. No information is available on mastitis related genes in buffaloes thus, the main aim {{of the present study}} was to analyze the buffalo transcriptome for extracting sequence of mastitis related genes (IL- 1 B, IL 6, IL 8 and IL- 12 B), the {{expression of}} these genes across various tissues using RNA-Seq, analyse the functional pathways and confer the phylogenetic relationship of these Interleukin genes with other species. IL 1 B revealed high expression in lungs while IL 8 in mammary gland and IL 12 B in kidney respectively. The phylogenetic analysis revealed a clear homology between buffalo and cattle ILs. The results were confirmed by constructing gene and species tree. In species <b>tree,</b> <b>Bos</b> taurus was nearest to Bubalus bubalis followed by Ovis aries thereby grouping the whole Bovidae family together. The gene tree constructed with the help of Maximum likelihood methods clearly clustered IL 1 B and IL 8 in one clade. This may be attributed to structural and functional relationship of IL 8 induced after exposure to a variety of inflammatory stimuli including bacteria, oxidative stress, LPS, TNF and IL 1 B.
