Heusghem won over 35 minutes on Alavoine, and more than 10 minutes on second-placed Lambot, which was enough to take over the lead.

25|$|The {{promulgation}} of law for {{the protection}} of a position held purely on religious grounds cannot therefore be justified. It is irrational, as preferring the subjective over the objective. But it is also divisive, capricious and arbitrary. We do not live in a society where all the people share uniform religious beliefs. The precepts of any one religion – any belief system – cannot, by force of their religious origins, sound any louder in the general law than the precepts of any other. If they did, those out in the cold would be less than citizens; and our constitution would <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to a theocracy, which is of necessity autocratic. The law of a theocracy is dictated without option to the people, not made by their judges and governments. The individual conscience is free to accept such dictated law; but the State, if its people are to be free, has the burdensome duty of thinking for itself.|$|E

25|$|West Indies (269 and 369 {{for five}} declared) drew with England (355 and 197 for four). One {{of the great}} {{partnerships}} of Test cricket took the match away from England after they appeared to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to a straightforward victory. Sobers and Holford came together with West Indies just nine runs ahead with five second innings wickets down. In 320 minutes, they put on an unbeaten 274, with Sobers making 163 and Holford, in just his second Test, 105. Earlier sound batting by Butcher, Nurse and Sobers in West Indies's first innings middle order enabled a respectable total despite Higgs' six wickets for 91. England's reply relied on 96 from Tom Graveney, 91 from Jim Parks and 60 from Geoffrey Boycott. Basil D'Oliveira, in his first Test, was unluckily run out when a shot from Parks deflected on to the stumps at the bowler's end and Hall pulled a stump out. After Sobers' second innings declaration, England lost four quick wickets, but Milburn, in his second Test also, hit an unbeaten 126 and he and Graveney saw out time.|$|E
25|$|Paris Saint-Germain faced Maccabi Tel Aviv for a {{place in}} the group stages of the Europa League after the {{play-off}} round draw at UEFA headquarters in Switzerland. PSG's French Cup triumph saw them stamp their ticket for a return to continental competition where they hosted the first leg at the Parc des Princes before heading to Israel for the return tie a week later. Paris Saint-Germain took the lead to Israel for the second leg of their play-off tie with Maccabi Tel Aviv. Péguy Luyindula and Guillaume Hoarau scored the PSG goals. Paris Saint-Germain lost at Maccabi Tel Aviv but still advanced to the group stage of the Europa League on aggregate. Paris Saint-Germain came up against former Champions League winners Borussia Dortmund and former UEFA Cup champions Sevilla in a testing Group J in which Ukrainian team Karpaty Lviv were the outsiders. Nenê pounced for the only goal of the game as PSG notched an upset win away to Sevilla. Paris Saint-Germain were in command of Group J after defeating Karpaty Lviv at the Parc des Princes. Paris Saint-Germain drew with Borussia Dortmund thanks to substitute Clément Chantôme's 87th-minute strike. Paris Saint-Germain were held to a goalless draw by Borussia Dortmund in an entertaining affair in the capital. Mathieu Bodmer, Nenê and Guillaume Hoarau did the damage for the capital club as they qualified for the last-32 after inflicting a second defeat on Sevilla to give a hint that PSG's glory days of Cup Winners' Cup and Intertoto triumphs could <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> back.|$|E

However, Chang broke back immediately {{and went on to}} claim the third set, 6–3. During the fourth set, Chang experienced a severe attack of leg cramps, and though he won the set to level the match, he considered retiring from the match while up 2–1 in the fifth set.

2500|$|Probably {{the most}} famous play to evoke the Miracle of the Meadowlands, {{although}} with a very different outcome, occurred almost three decades later in a [...] As in 1978, an Indianapolis turnover on downs had given Pittsburgh {{the ball on the}} Indianapolis 2-yard line and an apparent three-point victory over the heavily favored Colts in the game's final two minutes. However, the Steelers had to keep running the ball, as the Colts still had all their timeouts left. A field goal would have at least required the Colts to score a touchdown (plus kick the extra point) to win the game, while a touchdown would essentially clinch victory, so it was in the Steelers' interest to keep running. A pass would run the risk of being intercepted, or seeing the defense knock the ball out of the quarterback's hand. But on the very first play, running back Jerome Bettis, who had not fumbled all season, had the ball knocked loose by Indianapolis middle linebacker Gary Brackett. Defensive back Nick Harper recovered the ball and appeared to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to an Edwards-like touchdown, but Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger managed to tackle Harper near midfield.|$|E

England won the One Day Prudential Trophy 2–1, Snow taking 3–35 at Lord's. [...] Australia lost the First Test at Old Trafford by 89 runs thanks to Snow, who took 4/41 & 4/87. They fought back at Lord's where Bob Massie's outrageous swing bowling took 16–137. However, Snow took 5/57 to peg back the Australians to a 36 run lead in the first innings, but couldn't stop Australia's first win in The Ashes for 13 Tests. At Trent Bridge in the drawn Third Test Snow dismissed Ian Chappell, Greg Chappell, Doug Walters, Ross Edwards and Bob Massie with 5/92 in the first innings and Keith Stackpole, Greg Chappell and Walters with 3/94 in the second as England held out for a draw. Snow took only two wickets at Headingley as [...] "Deadly" [...] Derek Underwood spun England to an Ashes retaining victory with 10/82, {{but he was the}} second highest scorer in the England first innings, adding 104 with Ray Illingworth (57) before he was stumped for 48 and given a standing ovation by the Yorkshire crowd. With The Ashes safe England lost the Fifth Test at The Oval by 5 wickets, Snow taking only one wicket after a Lillee bouncer bruised his wrist in the first innings, leading to more accusations that he did not try in the Australian fourth innings run chase. Even so, he was easily the biggest England wicket-taker with 24 wickets (23.12). It was a sad ending for the England team, many feeling that this was the last series in which the veteran 1970–71 team would play together as some players neared retirement, while others were unpopular with the selectors. Snow was under no illusions [...] "as long as I was taking wickets I was safe. If I missed out then I would <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> out".|$|E
