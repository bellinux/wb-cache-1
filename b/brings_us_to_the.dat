5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E
25|$|Each hour of {{this day}} is the new {{suffering}} and the new effort of the expiatory suffering of the Savior. And the echo of this suffering is already heard in every word of our worship service – unique and incomparable both {{in the power of}} tenderness and feeling and in the depth of the boundless compassion for the suffering of the Savior. The Holy Church opens before the eyes of believers a full picture of the redeeming suffering of the Lord beginning with the bloody sweat in the Garden of Gethsemane up to the crucifixion on Golgotha. Taking us back through the past centuries in thought, the Holy Church <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> foot of the cross of Christ erected on Golgotha, and makes us present among the quivering spectators of all the torture of the Savior.|$|E

Rajasekhar S of Cinemalead also gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and called it [...] "classy and brilliant", stating [...] "Vikram K Kumar has packed the movie {{in such a way}} that the audience never get bored.

500|$|Ariana Bacle of Entertainment Weekly {{called the}} music [...] "very Chronicle", {{comparing}} the video to Max Landis' previous work. Rachel Paoletta of MTV News describes the music video as [...] "a decidedly darker and more badass video" [...] compared to her [...] "sexy, sultry, and sandy video for 'Love Me Harder'". She {{also stated that}} [...] "Ariana Grande's new video takes us {{to the end of}} the world, and <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge of our seats". In response to similarities between the Grande video and the music video accompanying Australian band SAFIA's single [...] "You Are the One", Grande and Landis were accused of intellectual property theft. The controversy centered on similarities in the shared apocalyptic themes and stylistic format (a single, tracking shot) as well as parallels in the beginning of both videos (where a female protagonist exits a vehicle despite the protests of the male driver) and final shot (a lover's embrace as the world comes to an end around them). Members of the band described the similarities as an instance of when [...] "big labels and/or big film firms steal ideas from small independent creatives who are trying really hard to make something different for a change". Despite acknowledging similarities between the two videos, Landis denied that his ideas are stolen from them and commented that both music videos had much in common with a third earlier music video by Perth group Injured Ninja.|$|E
2500|$|The founder’s {{inscription}} {{was written}} on the inner west wall, above {{the entrance to the}} church, covering the entire width of the lintel. The text was written in four rows on the white basis with black letters of unequal size and it says that several persons participated in the construction and painting process of church. The text begins with trinity invocation on Church Slavonic language: “Izvolenijem Otca I savršenijem Sina I sapospešenijem”, which was normal for the founding labels of the Serbian and Bulgarian people in the Middle Ages. At the start, before the first word was preceded a small painted cross saved partially (lat. Invocatio symbolica) which in the Middle Ages [...] usually began and ended the inscriptions of this kind. Strangeness of founders inscription in Staničenje is that a mention of the Bulgarian Emperor <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> name of Vidin master Balaur. Also, the label reveals the fact which was unprecedented in other already known sources. We discover here that Balaur was co-ruler, which is important proof of its real power within the Bulgarian elite.|$|E
