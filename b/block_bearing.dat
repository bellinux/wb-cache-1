This block is now displayed at the Fortifications Interpretation Centre in Valletta.|$|E
6000|$|We {{set out in}} {{high spirits}} on the next morning (6.15 a.m., March 17th), riding, still southwards, up the Surr: the stony, broken surface now showed that we were fast {{approaching}} its source. Beyond the Umm Khárgah gorge on the western bank, rose a tall head, the Ras el-Rukabíyyah; and beyond it was a ravine, in which palms and water {{are said to be}} found. The opposite side raised its monotonous curtain of green and red traps, whose several projections bore the names of Jebel el-Wu'ayrah--the hill behind our camping-ground--Jebel el-Maín, and Jebel Sháhitah. A little beyond the latter debouched the Darb el-Kufl ("Road of Caravans"), alias Darb el-Ashárif ("Road of the Sherifs"), a winding gap, the old line of the Egyptian pilgrims, by which the Sulaymáyyán Bedawin still wend their way to Suez. The second name, perhaps, conserves the tradition of long-past wars waged between the Descendants of the Apostle and the Beni Ukbah.[EN#26] The broad mouth was dotted with old graves, with quartz-capped memorial-cairns, and, here and there, with a <b>block</b> <b>bearing</b> some tribal mark. The Wady-sole grew a [...] "stinkhorn" [...] held to be poisonous, and called, from its fetor, [...] "Faswat el-Agúz" [...] (Cynophallus impudicus): one specimen was found on the tip of an ibex-horn, and the other had been impaled with a stick. After two hours and thirty minutes (= seven miles) we sighted the head of the Wady Surr proper, whose influents drain the southern Khurayatah or Hismá Pass. Here the amount of green surface, and the number of birds, especially the blue-rock and the insect-impaling [...] "butcher," [...] whose nests were in the thin forest of thorn-trees, argue that water is not far off. The Ras Wady Surr is a charming halting-place.|$|E

40|$|AbstractConstruction {{of low-income}} housing {{projects}} is a replicated process and {{is associated with}} uncertainties that arise from the unavailability of resources. Government agencies and/or contractors have to select a construction system that meets low-income housing projects constraints including project conditions, technical, financial and time constraints. This research presents a framework, using computer simulation, which aids government authorities and contractors in the planning of low-income housing projects. The proposed framework estimates the time and cost required {{for the construction of}} low-income housing using pre-cast hollow core with hollow <b>blocks</b> <b>bearing</b> walls. Five main components constitute the proposed framework: a network builder module, a construction alternative selection module, a simulation module, an optimization module and a reporting module. An optimization module utilizing a genetic algorithm enables the defining of different options and ranges of parameters associated with low-income housing projects that influence the duration and total cost of the pre-cast hollow core with hollow <b>blocks</b> <b>bearing</b> walls method. A computer prototype, named LIHouse_Sim, was developed in MS Visual Basic 6. 0 as proof of concept for the proposed framework. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the use of the developed framework and to illustrate its essential features...|$|R

At the tops of the embankments where the soil is thin, unformed sandstone blocks are visible. The tops of these blocks are at ground level. A number of blocks are also located at the south western corner of the site near where the smaller embankment crosses a gully.

50|$|Djehuti is attested on the Turin canon and the Karnak king list. All of Djehuti's {{contemporary}} attestions {{come from}} a 145 km long stretch of the Nile valley from Deir el-Ballas in the north to Edfu in the south. This roughly corresponds to the territory {{in the sphere of}} influence of the rulers of the 16th dynasty. Djehuti's nomen and prenomen are known from a single block discovered by Flinders Petrie in Deir el-Ballas. A painted <b>block</b> <b>bearing</b> Djehuti's cartouche and showing him wearing the red crown of Lower Egypt - far beyond his sphere of influence - was uncovered in Edfu and otherwise, Djehuti is only attested by objects from his wife's burial. Queen Mentuhotep's tomb was found intact in 1822 and her (now lost) coffin was inscribed with one of the earliest cases of the texts from the Book of the Dead.

5000|$|The {{original}} {{inner door}} with its knocker still remains. The plan has a central hall with rooms on either side; the western portion is comparatively modern. In {{the room to}} the right of the hall, the panelling is noteworthy, though some of it has evidently been brought from elsewhere. The cornice is supported by well-proportioned turned columns, with square pilasters below the mantelshelf. [...] Also seen is a freeze of the foliage and garlands suspended from the lions’ mouths. The house has 17th century panelling with Ionic pilasters which have decorations of vine stems, particularly on the west wall. The windows in the manor house are [...] "mullioned in the range of three to five". On the east wall, there is pilaster of [...] "stylized figure under cocked hat". The hall has panelling of simple design with fluted pilasters. The east side of the hall has the staircase (with rounded newels and widely spaced balustrades) concealed by an ordinary looking screen. On the first floor, in the bedroom, is an oak mantelpiece with a curious carved panel above, representing the offering up of Isaac. It is Flemish in character, and it is doubtful if it belongs to the rest of the chimney piece. The cellar of the house contains concrete <b>block</b> <b>bearing</b> a Rosy Cross, and such a cross was previously included in a stained glass window. This may suggest that Rosicrucians met at Arreton, probably within living memory.|$|E
