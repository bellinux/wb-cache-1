5|$|Inadequate {{and poorly}} {{maintained}} fire-fighting and rescue systems {{both on the}} vessel and on the jetty: Gulf and Total were held jointly to <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>this.</b> A combination of human failings and financial constraints was the immediate cause.|$|E
5|$|Incorrect {{unloading}} sequences and ballasting {{which resulted}} in the buoyancy of the hull becoming uneven and the hull therefore strained: Lack of crew training or knowing malpractice were possible explanations. Total was held largely to <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>this.</b> However, given that all the personnel involved in the unloading had died in the explosion, it was difficult to be certain as to what had happened.|$|E
5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> – I never think that, never...|$|E

25|$|The {{limited access}} to housing provokes strong local politics. It is often assumed that tourism is to <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>this,</b> {{attracting}} newcomers to the area {{who can afford to}} outbid locals for available housing. Many buildings are used for tourist accommodation which reduces the number available for local residents. Second homes are also thought to account for a significant proportion of the housing stock, leaving many buildings empty for much of the year.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, the Obote {{government}} launched Operation Bonanza, {{a military}} expedition that claimed {{tens of thousands}} of lives and displaced {{a significant portion of the}} population. The brunt of the <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> massacre was placed on the people of northern Uganda for supporting the action of the Prime Minister which increased the existing regional tensions in the country. It has been estimated that approximately 100,000 to 500,000 people died as a result of fighting between Obote's Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA) and the guerrillas.|$|E

25|$|Quicksilver plays {{a pivotal}} role in the limited series House of M, convincing his now mentally {{unstable}} sister Wanda to use her abilities to warp reality and create a world where mutants are in a majority and humans are the minority. Thanks to Wolverine retaining his memories, along with the mysterious Layla Miller, many of Earth's heroes regain their memories and battle Magneto, who also remembers and realizes that Pietro is to <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> mistake. Magneto kills Quicksilver (crushing his body with a robot Sentinel) in a rage at this perceived 'abuse' of his dream, although the character is resurrected and the normal reality restored when the Scarlet Witch witnesses this, telling Magneto he cares more for mutants than his own children. In retaliation the Scarlet Witch has also depowered 98% of the mutant population, which by accident includes Quicksilver.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, by mid-afternoon, {{the rear}} of the column—believing the day's march to be nearly at an end—was dawdling. This {{resulted}} in the army becoming separated, with some having already crossed the summit and others still approaching it. At this point the Turks, who had been following and feinting for many days, seized their opportunity and attacked those who had not yet crossed the summit. The French, both soldiers and pilgrims, taken by surprise, were trapped. Those who tried to escape were caught and killed. Many men, horses, and much of the baggage were cast into the canyon below. The chronicler William of Tyre, writing between 1170 and 1184 and thus perhaps too long after the event to be considered historically accurate, placed the <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> disaster firmly on the amount of baggage being carried, much of it reputedly belonging to Eleanor and her ladies, and the presence of non-combatants.|$|E
25|$|As {{they joined}} Emma at Merlin's tree, Arthur and his Knights {{are ready to}} stop Regina and Emma from {{releasing}} Merlin, calling them liars. As Regina unleashed her hand of fire to keep Arthur at bay, she tells Emma to use the spell, which unleashes light and dark magic, freeing Merlin. The now-human sorcerer then calls out Emma, and lashed out at Arthur, telling the King that he - and not Merlin's false prophecies - are to <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> mess, and added {{as long as the}} dagger and Excalibur are separated Merlin is untouchable. Arthur, however says this is far from over. Merlin later lifted Arthur’s spell off of David and Mary Margaret. Hook asks Merlin if he can he free Emma to remove darkness out of her. Merlin revealed he could lift the darkness from Emma, but there was just one thing he needs from Emma, and that is if Emma's heart was ready to release the darkness from hers.|$|E
50|$|One {{critique}} is that {{findings of}} association within candidate-gene studies {{have not been}} easily replicated in follow up studies.

25|$|While {{she was in}} Qazvin, her uncle, Mulla Muhammad Taqi Baraghani, was murdered, and the <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> {{placed on}} her by her husband, even though she denied any involvement. Baraghani had been an inveterate enemy of Shaykh Ahmad. During Táhirih's stay in Qazvin, Baraghani had {{embarked}} {{on a series of}} sermons in which he attacked the Báb and his followers. There is no hard evidence as to the identity of the murderer, nor any proof as to Táhirih's involvement or lack of it. With her arrest Táhirih’s powerful father convinced the authorities that rather than kill Táhirih, she would be imprisoned in her home. Táhirih’s father kept her under house-arrest in his cellar, appointing her maids to act as spies. Though interpreted as a cruel act in Root’s interviews with family members of Táhirih one claimed this was done out of genuine fear for her safety. Her father was convinced of his daughters’ innocence, but her husband was violently against her. He argued that Táhirih be put on trial for the murder of her uncle. Her father positively refused citing Táhirih would never leave her home. Nevertheless, authorities forcefully arrested Táhirih and one of her maids in the hope that she would testify against her.|$|E
500|$|Bird {{was quick}} to defend the virtuousness of students. [...] In November 1853, in a reply to {{a letter from a}} student in the Provincial Medical and Surgical Journal {{complaining}} of a lack of moral care from his superiors, Bird attacked the prevalent public view that students were [...] "guilty of every kind of open vice and moral depravity". [...] Bird laid much of the <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> public opinion on the caricatures of students in the writings of Charles Dickens. [...] He {{went on to say that}} the behaviour and character of students had greatly improved over the preceding ten years. [...] He attributed this improvement in part to the greatly increased study requirements imposed on students, but also in part to Christian influences acting on them. [...] He also commented that pious students had once been ridiculed, but were now respected.|$|E
500|$|Instead of {{accepting}} the Emperor's decision, Honório Hermeto offered his resignation, {{along with those}} of his colleagues. Astonished by his behavior, the Emperor would say years later when recalling the incident: [...] "Paraná não se curvava!" [...] (" [...] Paraná did not bow down!") PedroII asked the Liberals to form a new cabinet. For most of the next five years, Honório Hermeto and his Party of Order stood in opposition to the Liberals and the Courtier Faction. For the saquaremas, it meant enduring [...] "new elections, fixed results, partisan reprisals and policy shifts". Only a few saquaremas managed to get themselves elected to the Chamber during this period. All the <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> disaster fell upon Honório Hermeto. He lost much of his influence within the party, even though Vasconcelos alone in the Party of Order possessed the qualifications to challenge Honório Hermeto as the party's elder statesman.|$|E
50|$|As {{it turned}} out Georgia joined Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina and Louisiana in {{supporting}} the Arizona senator as a protest against the Civil Rights Act, although it did so by a smaller margin - 8.25 percentage points - than any other Deep South state Goldwater carried. Over-representation of urban areas in polling was <b>blamed</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> discrepancy.|$|R
50|$|NDP support fell {{even further}} in the 1999 election, leaving the party with just nine seats. However, this was largely due to {{tactical}} voting in which NDP supporters voted Liberal in hopes of removing Harris and the Tories from power. As a result, Hampton was not <b>blamed</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> severe defeat and stayed on as leader.|$|R
60|$|His manner towards Déroulède had {{undergone}} a change. He had become suave and unctuous, a kind of elephantine irony pervading his laborious attempts at conciliation. He and the Public Prosecutor would be severely <b>blamed</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> day's work, if the popular Deputy, relying upon {{the support of the}} people of Paris, chose to take his revenge.|$|R
500|$|Elizabeth {{was happy}} to play the part, but it is {{possible}} that in the last decade of her life she began to believe her own performance. She became fond and indulgent of the charming but petulant young Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, who was Leicester's stepson and took liberties with her for which she forgave him. She repeatedly appointed him to military posts despite his growing record of irresponsibility. After Essex's desertion of his command in Ireland in 1599, Elizabeth had him placed under house arrest and the following year deprived him of his monopolies. In February 1601, the earl tried to raise a rebellion in London. He intended to seize the queen but few rallied to his support, and he was beheaded on 25 February. Elizabeth knew that her own misjudgements were partly to <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> turn of events. An observer reported in 1602 that [...] "Her delight is to sit in the dark, and sometimes with shedding tears to bewail Essex".|$|E
500|$|In {{a change}} from {{previous}} series, Channel 4 {{announced that it would}} no longer donate any of its income from the premium-rate telephone lines, by which viewers vote for whom {{they would like to see}} evicted or win the programme, to charitable organisations. The broadcaster said that the current economic downturn is to <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> decision and that the change would bring Big Brother into line with other programmes of its kind, such as The X Factor and Strictly Come Dancing. The format of the live eviction interview programme was altered for this series. Unlike previous series in which McCall interviewed evicted housemates by herself, she was instead joined by two guest panellists to [...] "interrogate" [...] the evictee. Panellists included former housemates, journalists, psychologists, and fans of the programme. A new rule was added to the programme at the start of the series; [...] "fake romances" [...] were not permitted.|$|E
500|$|In {{a section}} {{apparently}} reprinted from earlier publications, the pamphlet discerns [...] "Reasons for the Growth of Sodomy" [...] {{in a number}} of aspects of British culture. It claims that, in past ages, British middle-class gentlemen had led moral, industrious lives, serving King, country, and family. This era, the pamphlet claims, was now past and lost; the constitution of the gentleman has deteriorated. Contemporary infants, it says, faced grim prospects, being pampered in nurseries by mothers who dominated their weak fathers. Such children, the pamphlet argued, could not help but to grow up effete and were [...] "scarcely worth raising". Some of the <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>this,</b> the pamphlet claims, lay with the increasing popularity of raising children at home, and having them educated by women, rather than sending them to school or to be apprenticed. Lacking the boisterous companionship of other boys they could not acquire manly traits; governed by women, they never learned to dominate women themselves, which, the pamphlet claimed, was requisite to please a wife.|$|E

500|$|Scully was {{a writer}} and co-executive {{producer}} on Everybody Loves Raymond for part of season seven and all of season eight, winning an Emmy for his work. Scully co-created (with wife Julie Thacker) The Pitts for Fox and Complete Savages for ABC, which was produced by Mel Gibson. The Pitts was a sitcom about a family suffering from bad luck. Thacker stated the show was designed [...] "as a companion piece for The Simpsons. It had a very cartoony feel to it. We always knew the initial audience for the show would be 12-year-olds to start, and then when families saw that the writing was very Simpsons - like, {{because many of the}} writers were from The Simpsons, [...] families would start to watch it together." [...] It was canceled after six episodes; Scully and Thacker laid the <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> on the show's timeslot, 9:30P.M., which was too late for the target audience. Complete Savages, which Thacker and Scully wrote with the [...] "Simpsons sensibility" [...] of layered jokes, was canceled in January 2005 due to low ratings and network anger at Scully and Thacker's decision to write to TV critics in what the Hartford Courant labelled [...] "unsanctioned promoting". A fan of NRBQ, Scully produced, with Thacker, a documentary about the band in 2003 entitled NRBQ: Rock 'n' Roll's Best Kept Secret; Scully employed the group as the [...] "unofficial house band" [...] of The Simpsons during his tenure as showrunner. Scully also created a pilot for Fox called Schimmel in 2000, starring Robert Schimmel, which was dropped after Schimmel was diagnosed with cancer.|$|E

5000|$|In British Guiana and Trinidad, white overseers and {{managers}} would {{take advantage of}} Indian coolie women and use them in sexual relationships, the Indian women were then <b>blamed</b> <b>for</b> these incidents and viewed as allegedly [...] "loose" [...] and promiscuous by colonial officials, and Indian women were subjected to {{a high rate of}} [...] "wife murders" [...] by Indian men, the Indian women were also <b>blamed</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> due to their [...] "inconstancy" [...] due to alleged low [...] "sexual morality".|$|R
40|$|In {{the latest}} set of EU stress tests, several German lenders {{performed}} poorly. As Markus Demary writes, {{some of this}} performance has been blamed on low interest rates squeezing the profitability of lenders.
