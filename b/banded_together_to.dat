5|$|The battle site at Kellogg's Grove {{was listed}} on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on June 23, 1978. The listing {{included}} a 1½ acre public park where a stone monument and memorial cemetery is located. The cemetery holds the interred remains of the militia who died during both battles at Kellogg's Grove. The men were initially buried in other spots around the grove but during the 1880s local farmers <b>banded</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> collect {{the remains of the}} Black Hawk War dead and inter them in one spot beneath a memorial.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{campaign}} {{begins in}} the spring of 2015, as a global alien invasion begins. Prior {{to the start of the}} game, a group of countries called the Council of Nations has <b>banded</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> create XCOM (short for Extraterrestrial Combat Unit), the most elite military and scientific organization in human history, tasked with defending them from the alien attack. The player assumes the role of the commander of XCOM, and proceeds to engage in a war against an extraterrestrial enemy with overwhelming technological superiority.|$|E
5|$|In 1543, several {{conservative}} clergymen in Kent <b>banded</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> {{attack and}} denounce two reformers, Richard Turner and John Bland, before the Privy Council. They prepared articles {{to present to}} the Council, but at the last moment, additional denunciations were added by Stephen Gardiner's nephew, Germain Gardiner. These new articles attacked Cranmer and listed his misdeeds back to 1541. This document and the actions that followed were the basis of the so-called Prebendaries' Plot. The articles were delivered to the Council in London and were probably read on 22 April 1543. The king most likely saw the articles against Cranmer that night. The archbishop, however, appeared unaware that an attack on his person was made. His commissioners in Lambeth dealt specifically with Turner's case where he was acquitted, much to the fury of the conservatives.|$|E

5|$|At {{the behest}} of Empress Catherine, Şahin allowed Russians to settle in the peninsula, further infuriating Crimeans. A group of these {{settlers}} {{had been sent to}} Yeni-Kale, which remained under Russian control following the installation of Şahin as Khan. Local residents <b>banded</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> prevent the Russian settlement, rebelling against Şahin. He sent the new conscript army he had created to quash the rebellion, only to see his forces defect to the rebels. Revolt spread across the peninsula, and rebel forces advanced on Şahin's palace in Bakhchisaray. Amidst this rebellion, exiled Crimeans in Constantinople pressed the Ottoman government to act. Bowing to pressure, the government sent a fleet to Crimea, ostensibly to preserve the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. Russia, however, was quicker to act. Russian forces arrived at Yeni-Kale in February 1778, crushing the revolt before the Ottoman fleet arrived. When the fleet arrived in March, it found that there were no rebels left to support. It fought a brief skirmish with the Russian navy off Akitar (modern Sevastopol), but was forced to flee. Şahin was reinstated as Khan. Minor skirmishes between the Ottoman and Russian navies continued until October 1778, when the Ottoman fleet returned defeated to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{approximately}} 90 {{percent of}} Burger King's franchises have <b>banded</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> form the Burger King National Franchise Association (BKNFA or NFA). The 900-member group {{is based in}} Atlanta, Georgia, and {{is designed to provide}} what the group calls Franchisee Relations Advocacy. It acts as a corporate negotiator that mediates with corporate-franchise disputes, as a government lobbying group to deal with issues that affect the fast-food industry as a whole, and it provides group health, property and casualty insurance. In 2001, the group announced a plan to purchase Burger King from then-parent Diageo after the company put forth a plan to float approximately 20 percent of BKC on the NYSE. The NFA believed that any money raised from the issue would not be put into helping bolster the then flagging BK, but would instead end up being used to help Diageo bolster its liquor brands. The deal collapsed when the NFA was unable to put together an acceptable financing package.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{significant}} events of Darius's early reign was the slaying of Intaphernes, {{one of the seven}} noblemen who had deposed the previous ruler and installed Darius as the new monarch. The seven had made an agreement that they could all visit the new king whenever they pleased, except when he was with his wife. One evening, Intaphernes went to the palace to meet Darius, but was stopped by two officers who stated that Darius had retired for the night. Becoming enraged and insulted, Intaphernes drew his sword and cut off the ears and noses of the two officers. While leaving the palace, he took the bridle from his horse, and tied the two officers together. The officers went to the king and showed him what Intaphernes had done to them. Darius began to fear for his own safety; he thought that all seven noblemen had <b>banded</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> rebel against him and that the attack against his officers was the first sign of revolt. He sent a messenger to each of the noblemen, asking them if they approved of Intaphernes's actions. They denied and disavowed any connection with Intaphernes's actions, stating that they stood by their decision to appoint Darius as King of Kings.|$|E
