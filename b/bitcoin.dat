5|$|Encrypting {{ransomware}} {{returned to}} prominence in late 2013 with {{the propagation of}} CryptoLocker—using the <b>Bitcoin</b> digital currency platform to collect ransom money. In December 2013, ZDNet estimated based on <b>Bitcoin</b> transaction information that between 15 October and 18 December, the operators of CryptoLocker had procured about US$27 million from infected users. The CryptoLocker technique was widely copied in the months following, including CryptoLocker 2.0 (though not {{to be related to}} CryptoLocker), CryptoDefense (which initially contained a major design flaw that stored the private key on the infected system in a user-retrievable location, due to its use of Windows' built-in encryption APIs), and the August 2014 discovery of a Trojan specifically targeting network-attached storage devices produced by Synology. In January 2015, it was reported that ransomware-styled attacks have occurred against individual websites via hacking, and through ransomware designed to target Linux-based web servers.|$|E

50|$|Ownership of <b>bitcoins</b> {{implies that}} a user can spend <b>bitcoins</b> {{associated}} with a specific address. To do so, a payer must digitally sign the transaction using the corresponding private key. Without knowledge of the private key, the transaction cannot be signed and <b>bitcoins</b> cannot be spent. The network verifies the signature using the public key.|$|R
50|$|The Winklevoss {{twins have}} {{invested}} into <b>bitcoins.</b> In 2013 The Washington Post {{claimed that they}} owned 1% of all the <b>bitcoins</b> in existence at the time.|$|R
5|$|Payment is {{virtually}} always the goal, {{and the victim}} is coerced into paying for the ransomware to be removed—which {{may or may not}} actually occur—either by supplying a program that can decrypt the files, or by sending an unlock code that undoes the payload's changes. A key element in making ransomware work for the attacker is a convenient payment system that is hard to trace. A range of such payment methods have been used, including wire transfers, premium-rate text messages, pre-paid voucher services such as Paysafecard, and the digital currency <b>Bitcoin.</b> A 2016 survey commissioned by Citrix claimed that larger businesses are holding <b>bitcoin</b> as contingency plans.|$|E
5|$|CryptoWall 3.0 used a payload {{written in}} JavaScript {{as part of}} an email attachment, which {{downloads}} executables disguised as JPG images. To further evade detection, the malware creates new instances of explorer.exe and svchost.exe to communicate with its servers. When encrypting files, the malware also deletes volume shadow copies, and installs spyware that steals passwords and <b>Bitcoin</b> wallets.|$|E
5|$|The idea of abusing {{anonymous}} cash {{systems to}} safely collect ransom from human kidnapping {{was introduced in}} 1992 by Sebastiaan von Solms and David Naccache. This money collection method is a key feature of ransomware. In the von Solms-Naccache scenario a newspaper publication was used (since <b>bitcoin</b> ledgers did not exist {{at the time the}} paper was written).|$|E

50|$|Theft also {{occurs at}} sites where <b>bitcoins</b> {{are used to}} {{purchase}} illicit goods. In late November 2013, an estimated $100 million in <b>bitcoins</b> were allegedly stolen from the online illicit goods marketplace Sheep Marketplace, which immediately closed. Users tracked the coins as they were processed and converted to cash, but no funds were recovered and no culprits identified. A different black market, Silk Road 2, stated that during a February 2014 hack, <b>bitcoins</b> valued at $2.7 million were taken from escrow accounts.|$|R
5|$|Encrypting {{ransomware}} reappeared in September 2013 with a Trojan {{known as}} CryptoLocker, which generated a 2048-bit RSA key pair and uploaded {{in turn to}} a command-and-control server, and used to encrypt files using a whitelist of specific file extensions. The malware threatened to delete the private key if a payment of <b>Bitcoin</b> or a pre-paid cash voucher was not made within 3 days of the infection. Due to the extremely large key size it uses, analysts and those affected by the Trojan considered CryptoLocker extremely difficult to repair. Even after the deadline passed, the private key could still be obtained using an online tool, but the price would increase to 10 BTC—which cost approximately US$2300 as of November 2013.|$|E

Cortana can forecast results in various other sports such as the NBA, the NFL, the Super Bowl, the ICC Cricket World Cup and various European football leagues. Cortana can solve mathematical equations, convert units of measurement, and determine the exchange rates between currencies including <b>Bitcoin.</b>|$|E
5|$|In May 2017, the WannaCry {{ransomware}} attack {{spread through}} the Internet, using an exploit vector named EternalBlue, which was leaked from the U.S. National Security Agency. The ransomware attack, unprecedented in scale, infected more than 230,000 computers in over 150 countries, using 20 different languages to demand money from users using <b>Bitcoin</b> cryptocurrency. WannaCrypt demanded US$300 per computer. The attack affected Telefónica and several other large companies in Spain, as well as parts of the British National Health Service (NHS), where at least 16 hospitals had to turn away patients or cancel scheduled operations, FedEx, Deutsche Bahn, Honda, Renault, {{as well as the}} Russian Interior Ministry and Russian telecom MegaFon. The attackers gave their victims a 7-day deadline from the day their computers got infected, after which the encrypted files would be deleted.|$|E

50|$|On 20 March 2014, Mt. Gox {{reported}} {{on its website}} that it found some <b>bitcoins</b> — worth around $116 million — in an old digital wallet used prior to June 2011. That brought {{the total number of}} <b>bitcoins</b> the firm lost down to 650,000, from 850,000.|$|R
5|$|Ransomware {{is a type}} of {{malicious}} software from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. While some simple ransomware may lock the system in a way which is not difficult for a knowledgeable person to reverse, more advanced malware uses a technique called cryptoviral extortion, in which it encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to decrypt them. In a properly implemented cryptoviral extortion attack, recovering the files without the decryption key is an intractable problem – and difficult to trace digital currencies such as Ukash and <b>Bitcoin</b> are used for the ransoms, making tracing and prosecuting the perpetrators difficult. Recent Ransomware attack in 2017 has caused a stir in the world as the attack caused many of the internet connected devices to not work and companies spent a large amount to recover from these attacks.|$|E
5|$|The Steam client {{includes}} a digital storefront called the Steam Store through which users can purchase computer games. Once {{the game is}} bought, a software license is permanently attached to the user's Steam account, allowing {{him or her to}} download the software on any compatible device. Game licenses can be given to other accounts under certain conditions. Content is delivered from an international network of servers using a proprietary file transfer protocol. Steam sells its products in US and Canadian dollars, euros, pounds sterling, Brazilian reais, Russian rubles, Indonesian rupiah and Indian rupees depending on the user's location. From December 2010, the client supports the Webmoney payment system, which is popular in many European, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries. Starting in April 2016, Steam began accepting payments in <b>Bitcoin,</b> valued based on the user's geolocation, with transactions handled by BitPay. The Steam storefront validates the user's region; the purchase of titles may be restricted to specific regions because of release dates, game classification, or agreements with publishers. Since 2010, the Steam Translation Server project offers Steam users to assist with the translation of the Steam client, storefront, and a selected library of Steam games for twenty-seven languages. Steam also allows users to purchase downloadable content for games, and for some specific game titles such as Team Fortress 2, the ability to purchase in-game inventory items. In February 2015, Steam began to open similar options for in-game item purchases for third-party games.|$|E
