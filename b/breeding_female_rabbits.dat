5000|$|The American Rabbit Breeders' Association (ARBA) {{recommends}} delaying <b>breeding</b> of <b>female</b> <b>rabbits</b> {{until they}} reach the senior weight range. For Flemish Giants, this is 14 pounds, and a typical rabbit will reach this weight when they are about 9 months to one year. A Flemish Giant {{can take up to}} 1.5 years to reach their maximum weight and a breeder should wait until the rabbit is slightly over a year old before <b>breeding.</b> <b>Females</b> and males can become sexually mature at 4 months and 8 days. Once the rabbits are 3 months old they should be keep in separate cages or put females with females and males with males. If fighting occurs then they must be separated. The breeding lifespan of a rabbit is variable. Some breeders prefer not to have any more litters after the age of three years [...] while others continue to produce quality litters for five to eight years. The gestation period is between 28-31 days. On average they give birth at 30-32 days. The Flemish Giant rabbit can produce large litters, usually between 5 and 12 in a litter.|$|R

The research used survey method with <b>female</b> <b>rabbit</b> breeders as analysis unit. Population of 356 <b>female</b> <b>rabbit</b> breeders in Soppeng was used and a sample of 78 <b>female</b> <b>rabbit</b> breeders were selected by region. The result of the research showed that average work time of <b>female</b> <b>rabbit</b> breeders was 3. 044 hours per day, which was spent cleaning cages and equipment, preparing feedstuffs and feeding on rabbits, assisting bunnies breastfeed to their mother and health care.

50|$|In cooperatively {{breeding}} meerkats (Suricata suricatta) {{the dominant}} <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> {{is the oldest}} and heaviest female who is highly aggressive toward subordinate <b>females</b> during the <b>breeding</b> season and temporarily evicts subordinate females from the group. Evicted subordinates suffer repeated attacks during the later stages of the <b>breeding</b> <b>female's</b> pregnancy and showed GC levels two times higher than normal. Approximately 3 days after their birth, subordinate females return to the group to help rear the <b>breeding</b> <b>female's</b> pups, at which time the dominant female is no longer aggressive toward them. By inducing the stress response in subordinates the <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> disrupts the ovulatory cycle and prevents mating of the subordinate females, or causes the pregnancies of subordinates to fail if they do occur. If her social group is small the <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> evicts all subordinate females, {{but if it is}} large she targets older females, pregnant females and non-kin.|$|R

50|$|Caribou have {{developed}} adaptions for optimal metabolic efficiency during warm months {{as well as}} for during cold months. The body composition of caribou varies highly with the seasons. Of particular interest is the body composition and diet of <b>breeding</b> and non-breeding <b>females</b> between seasons. <b>Breeding</b> <b>females</b> have more body mass than non-breeding females between the months of March and September with a difference of around 10 kg more than non-breeding females. From November to December, non-breeding females have more body mass than <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> as non-breeding females were able to focus their energies towards storage during colder months rather than lactation and reproduction. Body masses of both <b>breeding</b> and non-breeding <b>females</b> peaked in September. During the months of March through April, <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> have more fat mass than the nonbreeding females with a difference of almost 3 kg. After this however, nonbreeding females on average have a higher fat mass than the <b>breeding</b> <b>females.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Infanticide is a {{mechanism}} of reproductive success {{that occurs in}} many species. Alpha female dwarf mongooses and African wild dogs kill offpring other than their own, but alpha males do not use infanticide to enforce reproductive suppression. This may occur because the breeding alpha may have sired a rare subordinate's offspring. Subordinate females time their rare pregnancies such that they give birth several days after the alpha female {{to reduce the risk}} of infanticide.Pregnant suborordinate meerkats are known to kill the pups of the dominant <b>breeding</b> <b>female.</b> No dominant female pups have ever been observed killed after their 4th day of life. Evicted subordinate females are kept out for 3 days after the <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> gave birth.Eight infanticides involving the killing of a subordinate female's offspring by the <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> have been observed in wild common marmosets, as well as two instances of infanticide in which the subordinate female bred and then killed the <b>breeding</b> <b>female's</b> babies. [...] Infanticidal marmoset females are often in the last trimester of pregnancy, but postpartum females don't commit infanticide.|$|R
