500|$|Walker's {{marriage}} {{ended in}} divorce in 1934, after he had an affair. He remarried and had a son named John, but his second marriage also {{ended in divorce}}. Walker graduated from the Command and General Staff School in June 1935 and was posted to Hamilton Field, first as Intelligence and Operations Officer of the 7th Bombardment Group, and then as commander of the 9th Bombardment Squadron. [...] While landing a Martin B-12 bomber, he overshot the runway. The station commander, Brigadier General Henry Arnold reported that Walker, [...] "supposed to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> best pilots, apparently cuts out completely, uses up [...] and finally hits a concrete block and spoils a perfectly good airplane when he normally would have given her the gun and gone around again." [...] After fifteen years in the rank, jokes circulated about his being the most senior first lieutenant in the Air Corps, but he was finally promoted to captain on 1 August 1935. He was temporary major from 20 October 1935 to 16 June 1936, and again on 4 October 1938, before the rank finally became substantive on 1 July 1940. He had another accident in 1937, when he crashed a B-17 on take off from Denver Municipal Airport but this time his flying skills were credited with saving the entire crew of nine from injury.|$|E
500|$|Frazier {{opened his}} junior season, {{and his first}} year under coach Pat Chambers, on November 5, 2011 in an {{exhibition}} game against Slippery Rock. He led the team in scoring with 19 points. Frazier also posted 7 assists and 6 rebounds, helping Penn State win the game 64–47. He {{took part in the}} Nittany Lions' first regular season contest on November 12 against Hartford, with 12 points, 6 assists, and 5 steals in spite of being given 28 minutes on the court. When asked on his communication with Frazier, Chambers said, [...] "I'm telling him to make plays... he has to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> leading scorers. He's got to look to score." [...] In the following game, Frazier made his second career display with 20 or more points. He also matched his career-high total on assists, with 10. This was his second double-double with Penn State. Frazier also finished with 6 rebounds, 3 steals, and 1 block. Chambers said in a post-game interview, [...] "I'm very greedy. I'm an old point guard, so I want more out of Tim Frazier, if you can imagine... what more means is even more leadership, even better habits. We're always trying to create the best habits we can for the most difficult situation.". Frazier helped power the 62–46 victory over Radford, the team's second consecutive win in the regular season. It was also Penn State's first round game in the Hall of Fame Tip Off tournament. In his next game against LIU-Brooklyn, Frazier scored a career-high 26 points and matched his assists record for the second straight game, with 10. It was his second-straight double-double and the third in his stint with Penn State. Chambers commented after the game, [...] "Tim was terrific. He was a great leader tonight. He did everything you ask your point guard to do tonight." [...] He helped the program reach a 3–0 record {{for the third time in}} 12 seasons. Following up on a loss to Kentucky, Frazier recorded 27 points on November 20, 2011 against South Florida. The next game, Frazier recorded a career-high 11 assists en route to his 4th double-double in 2011. On January 11, 2012, Frazier scored a career-high 30 points against Nebraska, with his team losing the game, 70–58. He led the Big Ten with eight 20-point games through the course of the year. By the end of the season, Frazier averaged 18.8 points, 6.2 assists, 4.7 rebounds, 2.4 steals, and 0.2 blocks. It was his highest scoring average with Penn State. He was named the John Lawther Team MVP, Second Team NABC All-District, All-Big Ten First Team, Academic All-Big Ten, Basketball Times' All-District, and Big Ten All-Defensive Team.|$|E
2500|$|While Operation Compass {{continued}} {{successfully in}} 1941 {{and resulted in}} the complete defeat of the Italian Army in North Africa, Wilson, who was already highly regarded by his First World War regimental colleague and now Secretary of State for War, Anthony Eden, had also won the confidence of Churchill himself.

2500|$|Perret {{decided to}} give up working in the United States for good {{at the end of}} summer 1921. His passion for the renewal of French {{cinematography}} was evident in this statement: [...] "The artistic, economic, scientific and social ambitions of the film industry are so strong that its potential is limitless. It should <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> most important domestic industries. But to get French film back on top, a place it never should have lost, and to assure its global expansion, the domestic film industry has to have a global vision in its subject matter, artisanship and casting. Our great history and tradition can provide the inspiration for international films, a fact that is not unknown to our foreign competitors who have pulled their story lines for their latest films from French history as told by our most famous novelists and playwrights." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Bob McKeown on the edition of January 26, 2005, of The Fifth Estate, Coulter came under criticism for her statement, [...] "Canada used to <b>be...</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> most... most loyal friends, and vice versa. I mean, Canada sent troops to Vietnam. Was Vietnam less containable {{and more of a}} threat than Saddam Hussein?" [...] McKeown contradicted her with, [...] "No, actually Canada did not send troops to Vietnam." [...] On the edition of February 18, 2005 of Washington Journal, Coulter justified her statement by referring to the thousands of Canadians who served in the American armed forces during the Vietnam era, either because they volunteered or because they were living in the United States during the war years and got drafted. She said, [...] "The Canadian Government didn't send troops... but... they came and fought with the Americans. So I was wrong. It turns out there were 10,000 Americans who happened to be born in Canada." [...] (There were actually between 5,000 and 20,000 Canadians who fought in Vietnam itself, including approximately 80 who were killed.) John Cloud of Time, writing about the incident a few months later, said, [...] "Canada [...] noncombat troops to Indochina in the 1950s and again to Vietnam in 1972".|$|E
