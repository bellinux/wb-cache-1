50|$|The {{inherent}} {{disadvantage of}} the radar <b>beam</b> <b>riding</b> {{system is that}} the beam spreads as it travels outward from the broadcaster. As the missile flies towards the target, it therefore becomes increasingly inaccurate. This {{is not a problem}} at short ranges, but as many early surface-to-air missiles were designed to work at long ranges, this was a major issue. For example, earlier versions of the RIM-2 Terrier missile introduced in the 1950s were beam riders, but later variants employed semi-active radar homing to improve their effectiveness against high-performance and low-flying targets. In contrast to <b>beam</b> <b>riding,</b> semi-active <b>guidance</b> becomes more accurate as the missile approaches the target.|$|R
50|$|The Bendix RIM-8 Talos was a {{long-range}} naval surface-to-air missile, and {{was among the}} earliest surface-to-air missiles to equip United States Navy ships. The Talos used radar <b>beam</b> <b>riding</b> for <b>guidance</b> to the vicinity of its target, and semiactive radar homing (SARH) for terminal guidance. The array of four antenna which surround the nose are SARH receivers which functioned as a continuous wave interferometer. Initial thrust was provided by a solid rocket booster for launch and a Bendix ramjet for flight to the target with the warhead serving as the ramjet's compressor.|$|R

2500|$|GAPA used <b>beam</b> <b>riding</b> <b>guidance,</b> {{in which}} the missile {{attempts}} to keep itself centred {{in the middle of}} a radar signal that is pointed directly at the target. This system allows a single powerful radar to act as both the tracking and guidance system. However, beam riding also means that the missile has to fly directly at its target, and therefore cannot [...] "lead" [...] it to a calculated intercept point. This means of guidance is generally inefficient as it requires the missile to continue maneuvering throughout the approach as the radar is moved to continue tracking the target. This can be significant in the case of high-speed aircraft.|$|E

50|$|Sky Arrow 90 {{share the}} same layout of its {{predecessor}} Type 90-1 air-launched unguided rocket, but with some design modifications to accommodate the change needed for guidance control. Most of the design parameters remain the same, such as maximum speed is still Mach 2, diameter is still 90 mm, weight is still around 17 kg, length is still around 1.25 m, depending on different warheads installed. The most significant difference is that two pairs of additional control surfaces have been added in front, {{and the addition of}} guidance systems. The maximum range is increased from the original 7 km of the unguided Type 90-1 to 8 km of Sky Arrow 90. Without the significant increase in size and weight due to the additional guidance and flight control system, the increased range would mean the decrease in the size of warhead installed. However, in comparison to unguided Type 90-1 rockets, dozens of which would be needed to take out a target, taking out the same target would only require two to three Sky Arrow 90, so the combat effective has actually increased and the smaller warhead is thus not a problem. Although the developer has claimed a variety of guidance systems such as infra-red and millimeter wave radar guidance can be adopted, only semi-active laser (SAL), laser <b>beam</b> <b>riding</b> and satellite <b>guidance</b> versions have been mentioned by the developer at exhibitions to be ready for potential customers. It’s reported that SAL version of Sky Arrow 90 is the one entered Chinese service.|$|R

50|$|Brakemine was {{the result}} of two {{independently}} developed versions of the <b>beam</b> <b>riding</b> <b>guidance</b> system concept. In 1942, Captain Sedgfield of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) wrote a technical paper on the concept. In 1943, Leslie H. Bedford, director of research at A.C. Cossor, independently developed the same idea while on a long train ride.|$|E

50|$|The light tank variant is {{armed with}} a fully stabilised 105mm rifled gun. The 105mm rounds carried consist of armour {{piercing}} fin stabilised discarding sabot (APFSDS), high explosive (HE), and high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rounds, and Chinese 105mm laser <b>beam</b> <b>riding</b> <b>guidance</b> anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM). The 105mm missile offers the capability to engage shore targets whilst still swimming at sea, where conventional ammunition would perform poorly due to the motion of sea waves.|$|E
50|$|Contrast {{this with}} <b>beam</b> <b>riding</b> systems, like the RIM-8 Talos, {{in which the}} radar is pointed at the target and the missile keeps itself {{centered}} in the beam by listening to the signal {{at the rear of}} the missile body. In the SARH system the missile listens for the reflected signal at the nose, and is still responsible for providing some sort of “lead” guidance. The disadvantages of <b>beam</b> <b>riding</b> are twofold: One is that a radar signal is “fan shaped”, growing larger, and therefore less accurate, with distance. This means that the <b>beam</b> <b>riding</b> system is not accurate at long ranges, while SARH is largely independent of range and grows more accurate as it approaches the target, or the source of the reflected signal it listens for. Reduced accuracy means the missile must use a very large warhead to be effective (i.e.: nuclear). Another requirement is that a <b>beam</b> <b>riding</b> system must accurately track the target at high speeds, typically requiring one radar for tracking and another “tighter” beam for guidance.|$|R
5000|$|One {{disadvantage}} {{of this approach}} is that the radar signal is cone-shaped, so the missile becomes increasingly inaccurate as it flies away from the radar. The RSA solved this by using a second radio signal for <b>beam</b> <b>riding,</b> allowing the tracking radar to have a wider search angle without effecting the accuracy of the missile. Another {{disadvantage of}} any <b>beam</b> <b>riding</b> system {{is that it is not}} possible to [...] "lead" [...] the target, and it is thus suitable only for slow targets or very short distances.|$|R
50|$|In modern use, laser <b>beam</b> <b>riding</b> is {{generally}} limited to short-range missiles, both anti-air and anti-tank. Examples include ADATS, the Starstreak, the RBS 70, MSS-1.2 and 9M119 Svir.|$|R
50|$|For FAAD, {{they decided}} to use a <b>beam</b> <b>riding</b> <b>guidance</b> system. This {{had been used in}} early {{missiles}} like the RIM-2 Terrier, but had been abandoned in favor of semi-active systems for all of the reasons above. In particular, in the case of beam-riding the signal is shaped like a cone centered on the broadcaster, which means it becomes increasingly inaccurate as the missile flies towards the target. Some sort of secondary terminal guidance system was almost always needed with beam-riding weapons.|$|E
5000|$|Development of Oerlikon's RSD 58 {{started in}} 1947, {{and was a}} closely held secret until 1955. Early {{versions}} of the missile were available for purchase as early as 1952, but never entered operational service. The RSD 58 used <b>beam</b> <b>riding</b> <b>guidance,</b> which has limited performance against high-speed aircraft, as the missile is unable to [...] "lead" [...] the target to a collision point. Examples were purchased by several nations for testing and training purposes, but no operational sales were made.|$|E
50|$|<b>Beam</b> <b>riding</b> <b>guidance</b> {{became more}} popular {{again in the}} 1980s and 90s with the {{introduction}} of low-cost and highly portable laser designators. A laser beam can be made much narrower than a radar beam while not increasing the size of the broadcaster. Additionally, it is simple to encode additional information in the beam using digital means, which has a number of advantages. Missiles with small optical receivers on their tail can beam-ride on lasers with similar ease as earlier radar beam systems, but will be inherently more accurate.|$|E
50|$|The Fireflash was a <b>beam</b> <b>riding</b> missile - it was {{designed}} to fly down a radio beam emitted by the launch aircraft, which the pilot would keep aimed at the target.|$|R
50|$|The LMMs in {{the initial}} batch use laser <b>beam</b> <b>riding</b> with {{infrared}} terminal homing and a laser proximity sensor, although a semi-active laser version is under development for precision surface attack roles.|$|R
5000|$|Guidance was {{provided}} by a Brown-Boveri radar system and <b>beam</b> <b>riding</b> receivers on the missile. <b>Beam</b> <b>riding</b> systems are the simplest systems to implement, as the ground-based system can consist solely of a tracking radar. The target is first {{picked up on the}} radar system and [...] "locked on". The missile is launched directly into the path of the radar, allowing receivers {{at the back of the}} missile to hear the radar signal and keep itself centred in the beam. The missile then flies directly at the target as long as the radar remains locked on.|$|R
5000|$|Brakemine was {{an early}} surface-to-air missile (SAM) {{development}} project {{carried out in the}} United Kingdom during World War II. Brakemine used a <b>beam</b> <b>riding</b> <b>guidance</b> system developed at A.C. Cossor, while REME designed the testbed airframes. Trial launches were carried out between 1944 and 1945, and the effort wound down as the war ended. Although Brakemine would never be used in its original form, its use of the [...] "twist-and-steer" [...] guidance method would later be used on the much more capable Bristol Bloodhound. A single Brakemine survives in the REME Museum.|$|E

50|$|The Lark {{project was}} a high-priority, solid-fuel boosted, liquid-fueled rocket surface-to-air missile {{developed}} by the United States Navy to meet the kamikaze threat. After Lark configuration was established by the Bureau of Aeronautics in January 1945 Fairchild Aircraft was given a contract to produce 100 missiles in March 1945. Fairchild used radio command guidance with a semi-active radar homing AN/DPN-7. A backup contract for another 100 missiles was given to Convair in June 1945. Convair used <b>beam</b> <b>riding</b> <b>guidance</b> with AN/APN-23 active radar homing. Neither version was successful. Six of the Convair airframes were given to Raytheon to explore use of velocity-gated continuous wave doppler radar for guided missile target seekers, while most other United States investigators used range-gated pulse radar. One of these Raytheon guidance systems in a Convair airframe scored the first successful United States surface-to-air missile interception of a flying target in January 1950.|$|E
