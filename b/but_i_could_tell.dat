25|$|Heirens's lawyers {{pressured}} {{him to take}} Tuohy's plea bargain. That deal, {{which was}} the topic of that closed-door meeting with Tuohy, stated that Heirens would serve one life sentence if he confessed to the murders of Josephine Ross, Frances Brown, and Suzanne Degnan. With {{the help of his}} lawyers, he began drafting a confession using the Chicago Tribune article as a guide:As it turned out, the Tribune article was very helpful, as it provided me with a lot of details I didn't know. My attorneys rarely changed anything outright, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> by their faces if I had made a mistake. Or they would say, 'Now, Bill, is that really the way it happened?' Then I would change my story because, obviously, it went against what was known (in the Tribune).|$|E
60|$|But {{little time}} was wasted in {{narration}} of our adventure. Tars Tarkas and Carthoris exchanged the dignified and formal greetings common upon Barsoom, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> intuitively that the Thark loved my boy and that Carthoris reciprocated his affection.|$|E
6000|$|MURRAY. He only {{smiled and}} said: [...] "We'll {{see if you}} gain weight to-morrow." [...] As if that mattered now! Why, I'm way above normal as it is! But you know Stanton--always putting you off. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> {{by the way he}} said it he'd be willing to consider---- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no!" [...] {{the negro}} screamed. [...] "Me swear me {{do not know}} where him be. You may burn me to death if you will, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not very," [...] said Rollo. [...] "I {{suppose the}} things {{were made of}} gold; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell,</b> {{from the looks of}} them, whether they were made of gold or brass." ...|$|R
6000|$|Agatha smiled. [...] "On the whole, <b>I</b> think not; <b>but</b> nothing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> {{would be}} of much use to you. My father, {{although}} he had been there, {{could not find the}} spot again." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was just}} {{daylight}} as we {{stepped down from}} the Pullman at West Salem, but father was there! Seated in our [...] "canopy-top surrey" [...] and holding restless ramping Black Dolly to her place, he was too busy to glance at us, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> by the set of his head, that he was emotionally intense.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} such a poor opinion of the Almighty, or of Kitchener," [...] said Susan stubbornly. [...] "I see there is a Bernstoff man in the States who says {{that the war is}} over and Germany has won--and they tell me Whiskers-on-the-moon says the same thing and is quite pleased about it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> them both that it is chancy work {{counting}} chickens even the day before they are hatched, and bears have been known to live long after their skins were sold." ...|$|E

[...] "He can see the unapproachable, {{beautiful}} simplicity of perfection, and bad work hurts him. I don't know that it's a crime to throw away money, but it is to waste intelligence and effort that could accomplish a good deal properly directed. Why was man given the power to understand the structure of this material world? I may be a worn-out whisky wreck, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> them how to strike the copper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There was a sound," [...] I muttered, [...] "I fancied {{that it was}} a cry. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell.</b> The {{wind was}} blowing, and the sea and rain! No, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not tell." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Michael {{was a real}} {{talent and}} as far as {{football}} goes it was not a case of if he’d make it, <b>but</b> when. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> from my very early days at the club {{that he was going to}} be a very good player." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'To {{something}} drear, distressing [...] As the knell [...] Of all hopes worth possessing!' [...] --What befell Seemed {{linked with}} me, <b>but</b> how <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell.</b>|$|R
60|$|Ans. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> him, that {{whatsoever}} {{is imposed}} {{as a part}} of God's worship, is judged by a better rule than his, both as to its goodness and badness, neither can we account any thing indifferent that is a part thereof. Besides, whatsoever is reputed a part of God's worship, layeth hold on the conscience of the godly: although a ranting Latitudinarian may say, 'If the devil should preach, I would hear him, before I would suffer persecution.' As a brave fellow which I could name, in his zeal was pleased to declare.|$|E
6000|$|Elsie {{exploded}} at last. But he took no offence. He smiled inanely, {{as if he}} rather enjoyed it. 'Look heah, you know,' he said, {{with his}} crafty smile; 'that's one too much. I'm not taking any. You think yourselves very clevah for kidding me with paintahs who are really macaroni and cheese and claret; yet if I were {{to tell you the}} Lejah was run at Ascot, or the Cesarewitch at Doncastah, why, you'd be no wisah. When it comes to art, I don't have a look in; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you {{a thing or two about}} starting prices.' ...|$|E
6000|$|And in he come, and Bill after him. But {{before they}} got in I {{was up in the}} upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. Then they stood there, with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. I couldn't see them, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> where they was by the whisky they'd been having. I was glad I didn't drink whisky; but it wouldn't made much {{difference}} anyway, because {{most of the time they}} couldn't a treed me because I didn't breathe. I was too scared. And, besides, a body COULDN'T breathe and hear such talk. They talked low and earnest. Bill wanted to kill Turner. He says: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know what}} to do now that old Hardy is cut off from us. I tried to stir up Dr. Spencer to go and investigate, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> him why, and he has not the same {{interest}} in going questing about as he used to have. People never will do the one thing one wants particularly!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I knew that. I {{can tell}} you, and <b>I</b> told Patience. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> him." [...] She {{paused a moment}} {{thinking}} whether she could describe the whole scene; but she found {{that she could not}} do that. [...] "I shall tell him, perhaps, when he comes again; that is, if he does come." ...|$|R
60|$|Something {{struck me}} as unusual about the place, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> at first what it was. One of the bedroom windows was open, and the {{customary}} short blind, with its brass upper rail partly unfastened, drooped obliquely across the vacant space. It looked negligent and odd, for usually everything about the cottage was conspicuously trim.|$|R
60|$|I {{never had}} such an awful night. When Joe and Charley weren't {{throwing}} fits they were making believe, and in the darkness the shivers from the cold which I couldn't see seemed like fits, too. And I shivered so hard I thought I was getting fits myself. And little Albert, with nothing to eat, just drooled and drooled. I never seen him as bad as that before. Why, he twisted that left eye of his until it ought to have dropped out. I couldn't see it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> from the movements he made. And Joe just lay and cussed and cussed, and Charley cried and wished {{he was back in}} the Home.|$|E
6000|$|NAPOLEON (with coarse familiarity, {{treating}} {{her as if}} she were a vivandiere). Capital! Capital! (He puts his hands behind him on the table, and lifts himself on to it, sitting with his arms akimbo and his legs wide apart.) Come: I am a true Corsican in my love for stories. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> them better than you if I set my mind to it. Next time you are asked why a letter compromising a wife should not be sent to her husband, answer simply that the husband would not read it. Do you suppose, little innocent, that a man wants to be compelled by public opinion to make a scene, to fight a duel, to break up his household, to injure his career by a scandal, when he can avoid it all by taking care not to know? ...|$|E
6000|$|He said it lightly, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that he {{felt the}} {{disappointment}} bitterly, while even I, who had expected nothing, wheeled the pack-horse around with an angry growl. It was toward dusk when we neared the creek we had crossed in the morning, {{but it was no}} longer shrunken. Evidently the dam of débris had given way, for it roared in full flood now, and it was with anxiety that we quickened our pace. The hillsides loomed black out of chilly mist that wrapped the serried ranks of climbing pines in their smoky folds. It was not yet dark in the valley, but the light was dying fast, and a bitter breeze swept down a darkening gorge, bringing with it the moan of an unseen forest until presently this was lost in the voice of the frothing torrent before us. There was neither fuel nor shelter on that side, and we determined to attempt the crossing, for, as Harry said, [...] "Hunger alone is bad, but hunger and cold together are worth an effort to avoid." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> {{him that}} it was driving me out of the ship I had learned to love. And as I sat heavy-hearted at that parting, seeing all my plans destroyed, my modest future endangered--for this command was like a foot in the stirrup for a young man--he gave up {{completely}} for the first time his critical attitude.|$|R
60|$|When my {{eyes opened}} I knew I had been awakened by something, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> what. <b>I</b> listened. Cubby was {{as quiet as}} a mouse, and his very quiet and the alert way he held his ears gave me a vague alarm. He had heard something. I thought of the old hunter's return, yet this did not reassure me.|$|R
60|$|I {{had half}} {{a mind to}} ride {{with them to the}} meet, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> who would cut me, and I knew the mortification would be so keen to them that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> how they would behave, and I was afraid Eustace's pride in his scarlet coat might be as {{manifest}} to others as to us, and make me blush for him. So I kept Dora and myself at home.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Leander Crawford {{is always}} crying in church," [...] said Susan contemptuously. [...] "She cries over every {{affecting}} thing the minister says. But {{you do not}} often see her name on a subscription list, Mrs. Dr. dear. Tears come cheaper. She {{tried to talk to}} me one day about Aunt Martha being such a dirty housekeeper; and I wanted to say, 'Every one knows that YOU have been seen mixing up cakes in the kitchen wash-pan, Mrs. Leander Crawford!' But I did not say it, Mrs. Dr. dear, because I have too much respect for myself to condescend to argue with the likes of her. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> worse things than THAT of Mrs. Leander Crawford, if I was disposed to gossip. And as for Mrs. Alec Davis, if she had said that to me, Mrs. Dr. dear, do you know what I would have said? I would have said, 'I have no doubt you would like to spank Faith, Mrs. Davis, but you will never have the chance to spank a minister's daughter either in this world or in that which is to come.'" ...|$|E
60|$|Birds and {{all other}} flying creatures are now very {{abundant}} in all the islands; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you some curious and interesting facts, too, as to the mode of their arrival and the vicissitudes of their settlement. For example, during {{the age of the}} Forest Beds in Europe, a stray bullfinch was driven out to sea by a violent storm, and perched at last on a bush at Fayal. I wondered at first whether he would effect a settlement. But at that time no seeds or fruits fit for bullfinches to eat existed on the islands. Still, as it turned out, this particular bullfinch happened to have in his crop several undigested seeds of European plants exactly suited to the bullfinch taste; so when he died on the spot, these seeds, germinating abundantly, gave rise to a whole valleyful of appropriate plants for bullfinches to feed upon. Now, however, there was no bullfinch to eat them. For a long time, indeed, no other bullfinches arrived at my archipelago. Once, to be sure, a few hundred years later, a single cock bird did reach the island alone, much exhausted with his journey, and managed to pick up a living for himself off the seeds introduced by his unhappy predecessor. But as he had no mate, he died at last, as your lawyers would say, without issue.|$|E
60|$|My friend's {{plans were}} {{gradually}} revealing themselves. From this convenient retreat, the watchers were being watched and the trackers tracked. That angular shadow up yonder was the bait, {{and we were}} the hunters. In silence we stood together in the darkness and watched the hurrying figures who passed and repassed in front of us. Holmes was silent and motionless; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that he was keenly alert, and that his eyes were fixed intently upon the stream of passers-by. It was a bleak and boisterous night and the wind whistled shrilly down the long street. Many people were moving to and fro, most of them muffled in their coats and cravats. Once or twice {{it seemed to me}} that I had seen the same figure before, and I especially noticed two men who appeared to be sheltering themselves from the wind in the doorway of a house some distance up the street. I tried to draw my companion's attention to them; but he gave a little ejaculation of impatience, and continued to stare into the street. More than once he fidgeted with his feet and tapped rapidly with his fingers upon the wall. It was evident to me that he was becoming uneasy, and that his plans were not working out altogether as he had hoped. At last, as midnight approached and the street gradually cleared, he paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. I was about to make some remark to him, when I raised my eyes to the lighted window, and again experienced almost as great a surprise as before. I clutched Holmes's arm, and pointed upward.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Auld warld tales! <b>But</b> <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> {{where the}} {{treasure}} is that wily auld Logan quarrelled {{over with the}} wizard Laird of Merchistoun. Logan would not implement the contract--half profits. But my wits are wool gathering.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... that I had printed {{poems in}} the Atlantic Monthly and the Saturday Press, {{and was the}} {{potential}} author of things destined to eclipse all literature hitherto attempted. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> him; {{and there was no}} one else who thought to tell him. Perhaps it was as well so; I might have perished of his recognition, for my modesty was equal to my merit.|$|R
60|$|I was silent; Helen had calmed me; {{but in the}} tranquillity she {{imparted}} {{there was}} an alloy of inexpressible sadness. I felt the impression of woe as she spoke, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> whence it came; and when, having done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean she}} is the wife of one of them, of course," [...] she answered, a little sharply; and then she turned herself {{somewhat}} more toward me. [...] "And the whole set try to make out they're French, for they talk it nearly all the time. But they're not French, for I heard them talk a good deal better English than they can talk French; and every time a branch nearly hits her, that lady sings out in regular English. And, besides, I know that their French isn't French French, because I can understand {{a great deal of}} it, and if it was I couldn't do it. I can talk French a good deal better than I can understand it, anyway. The French people jumble everything up so that I can't make head or tail of it. Father says he don't wonder they have had so many revolutions, when they can't speak their own language more distinctly. He tried to learn it, but didn't keep it up long, and so I took lessons. For, when we go to France, one of us ought to know how to talk, or we shall be cheated dreadfully. Well, you see, over on the little deck, up there, is that gentleman with his wife and a young lady, and they're all travelling together, and these make-believe French people have been jabbering about them ever so long, thinking that nobody else on board understands French. But I listened to them. I couldn't make out all they said, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that they were saying all sorts of things about those other people, and trying to settle which lady the gentleman was married to, and they made a big mistake, too, for they said the small lady was the one." ...|$|E

[...] "Now please listen--an' beggin' your pardon--jest turn thet deaf Mormon ear aside, an' {{let me talk}} clear an' plain in the other. I {{went around}} to the saloons an' the stores an' the loafin' places yesterday. All your riders are in. There's talk of a {{vigilance}} band organized to hunt down rustlers. They call themselves 'The Riders.' Thet's the report--thet's the reason given for your riders leavin' you. Strange thet only a few riders of other ranchers joined the band! An' Tull's man, Jerry Card--he's the leader. I seen him en' his hoss. He 'ain't been to Glaze. I'm not easy to fool on the looks of a hoss thet's traveled the sage. Tull an' Jerry didn't ride to Glaze!... Well, I met Blake en' Dorn, both good friends of mine, usually, {{as far as their}} Mormon lights will let 'em go. But these fellers couldn't fool me, an' they didn't try very hard. I asked them, straight out like a man, why they left you like thet. I didn't forget to mention how you nursed Blake's poor old mother when she was sick, an' how good you was to Dorn's kids. They looked ashamed, Miss Withersteen. An' they jest froze up--thet dark set look thet makes them strange an' different to me. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> the difference between thet first natural twinge of conscience an' the later look of some secret thing. An' the difference I caught was thet they couldn't help themselves. They hadn't no say in the matter. They looked as if their bein' unfaithful to you was bein' faithful to a higher duty. An' there's the secret. Why it's as plain as--as sight of my gun here." ...|$|E
