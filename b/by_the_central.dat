5|$|As {{with the}} early days of Sicilian Baroque, the first {{buildings}} of the new neoclassical era were often copies or hybrids of the two styles.

However, when a few years later the upper floor was added, despite the use of Baroque broken pediments above the windows, the neoclassical French influence is very pronounced, highlighted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> curved bay. The Sicilian Baroque was gradually and slowly being superseded by French neoclassicism.|$|E
