40|$|The {{reason this}} paper was made was to {{identify}} the functions with the highest importance factor of webbing used in auto seatbelts.

Depending on the importance of each function was developed an objective hierarchy of them, pursuing the imposed decisions technic. Using the Analysis and engineering value it was possible to do the functional analysis of the properties of webbing. By setting the functions value it was possible to obtain a series of decisions, specifying that a function corresponds to a single operating property. Following this analysis it was observed that the main characteristic of webbings is that they have a very good resistance to tensile stresses, characteristic imposed by the manner of operation during use. An important factor that was taken into account in analyzing the webbings was the fabric structure.

40|$|Podosomes are dynamic actin-based {{structures}} found constitutively {{in cells}} of monocytic origin such as macrophages, dendritic cells and osteoclasts. They {{have been involved}} in osteoclast cell adhesion, motility and matrix degradation, and all these functions rely on the ability of podosomes to form supra-molecular structures called podosome belts or sealing zones on mineralized substrates. Podosomes contain two distinct domains, an actin-rich core enriched in actin polymerization regulators, surrounded by a ring of signaling and plaque molecules. The organization of podosome arrays into belts is linked to actin dynamics. Cofilin is an actin-severing protein that is known to regulate cytoskeleton architecture and cell migration. Cofilin is present in lamellipodia and invadopodia where it regulates actin polymerization. In this report, we show that cofilin is a novel component of the podosome belt, the mature osteoclast adhesion structure. Time-course analysis demonstrated that cofilin is activated during primary osteoclast differentiation, at the time of podosome <b>belt</b> <b>assembly.</b> Immunofluorescence studies reveal a localization of active cofilin in the podosome core structure, whereas phosphorylated, inactive cofilin is concentrated in the podosome cloud. Pharmacological studies unraveled the role of a specific cofilin phosphatase to achieve cofilin activation during osteoclast differentiation. We ruled out the implication of PP 1 /PP 2 A and PTEN in this process, and rather provided evidence for the involvement of SSH 1.

40|$|Neptune's {{dynamical}} history {{shaped the}} current orbits of Kuiper belt objects (KBOs), leaving {{clues to the}} planet's orbital evolution. In the "classical" region, a population of dynamically "hot" high-inclination KBOs overlies a flat "cold" population with distinct physical properties. Simulations of qualitatively different histories for Neptune -including smooth migration on a circular orbit or scattering by other planets to a high eccentricity - have not simultaneously produced both populations. We explore a general Kuiper <b>belt</b> <b>assembly</b> model that forms hot classical KBOs interior to Neptune and delivers them to the classical region, where the cold population forms in situ. First, we present evidence that the cold population is confined to eccentricities well below the limit dictated by long-term survival. Therefore Neptune must deliver hot KBOs into the long-term survival region without excessively exciting the eccentricities of the cold population. Imposing this constraint, we explore the parameter space of Neptune's eccentricity and eccentricity damping, migration, and apsidal precession. We rule out much of parameter space, except where Neptune is scattered to a moderately eccentric orbit (e > 0. 15) and subsequently migrates a distance Delta aN= 1 - 6 AU. Neptune's moderate eccentricity must either damp quickly or be accompanied by fast apsidal precession. We find that Neptune's high eccentricity alone does not generate a chaotic sea in the classical region. Chaos can result from Neptune's interactions with Uranus, exciting the cold KBOs and placing additional constraints. Finally, we discuss how to interpret our constraints {{in the context of}} the full, complex dynamical history of the solar system. Comment: Corrected typos and made wording changes.

40|$|Final, April 2011 ‐May 2012 In a {{previous}} study, a computational model of child occupants 6 to 10 years old (YO) was validated {{using data from}} a sled test series with the 6 YO and 10 YO Hybrid‐III ATDs. Simulations using this model were used to identify characteristics of a vehicle seat and belt geometry that would improve occupant protection for older children not using booster seats. The current report presents a series of sled tests {{to examine the effects}} for other occupants using vehicle seats optimized for 6 ‐ to 10 ‐year‐old children. Tests were conducted with a 12 MO CRABI seated in a Graco SnugRide rear‐facing infant restraint and a Hybrid III 50 th male ATD. Seat cushion length was set to 450 mm, 400 mm, and 350 mm. Lap belt conditions included one representing the mid‐range of FMVSS No. 210, “Seat <b>belt</b> <b>assembly</b> anchorages,” allowable seat belt anchorage conditions as well as one more forward but closer to the vehicle seat H‐point. Shoulder belt conditions included the standard FMVSS No. 213 shoulder belt anchorage as well as one positioned closer to the adult male shoulder. Vehicle seats from a 2008 Dodge Town and Country were used, and some tests included modifications to make the front support structure of the seat cushion stiffer. The tests with the midsize adult male ATD showed no negative consequences from design changes intended to improve protection for children. Kinematics were similar among all conditions tested. For the rear‐facing infant restraint, none of the tests exceeded the 70 ° rotation angle requirement of FMVSS No. 213, although shorter cushion length and more forward belt locations produced larger rotations. The three tests with the more forward lap belt geometry slightly exceeded the 3 ‐ms‐chest clip acceleration limit of 60 g, but a review of all chest acceleration curves suggests that the vehicle seat may produce higher chest accelerations than the FMVSS No. 213 test bench. In tests with the shortest seat cushion length, the infant seat showed acceptable kinematics even though less than 80 percent of the child restraint base was initially supported on the vehicle seat. These preliminary tests with rear vehicle seat configurations selected to optimize protection for older child occupants produced good restraint kinematics for infants in a rear‐facing only child restraint and for adult mid‐size males. Additional research to identify possible negative consequences for other types of child restraints should be conducted. If shorter cushion lengths are chosen as a safety countermeasure for older children, the current child restraint installation requirement to have at least 80 percent of the base contacting the vehicle seat will need to be addressed...|$|E

40|$|The U. S. nursery {{industry}} is highly complex, and affected on their demand side by {{the construction industry}} and on their factor supply side by the market for low-skill labor, {{which in turn is}} influenced by gyrating construction activity as well as southern-border immigration. We examine an industry seeking to adapt to a changing demand and labor environment. Our emphasis is on the manner in which nurseries cope with increasing retailer power, increasingly quality- and variety-conscious consumers, and expectations of rising wages. We argue that the gradual growth of such labor aids as potting <b>assembly</b> <b>belts</b> and pruning equipment should be viewed in terms of a tradeoff among labor quantity, labor quality, and capital instead of the more conventional tradeoff between labor and capital. Management invests in training in order to substitute labor quality for quantity, and in on- and off-site-produced equipment in order to substitute capital for either. Capital intensification shifts the distribution of nursery skills. However, the skill distribution's shape can change in a number of ways. In a unimodal shift capital supplants labor continuously more at the lower than the higher skill levels. In a bimodal shift capital supplants mid-level employees, so that the skill distribution bifurcates between a low-skill and a high-skill mode. We argue that the capital substitution now arising in the U. S. nursery sector will take a unimodal form similar to those observed earlier in such farm commodity production as wheat and sugar beets. Low-skilled and seasonal workers, therefore, will be supplanted by more skilled and longer-term ones. Yet, rising product variety and retailer service demands will simultaneously bring a greater return to nursery computing investments, eliminating parts of the larger nurseries’ mid-level workforce and creating a renewed demand for low-skill laborers. In addition, the nursery industry will become more differentiated with respect to labor-intensity.

40|$|The Barchi-Kol {{terrain is}} a classic {{locality}} of ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphism within the Kokchetav metamorphic belt. We provide a detailed and systematic characterization of four metasedimentary samples using dominant mineral assemblages, mineral inclusions in zircon and monazite, garnet zonation with respect to major and trace elements, and Zr-in-rutile and Ti-in-zircon temperatures. A typical diamond-bearing gneiss records peak conditions of 49 ± 4 kbar and 950 – 1000 °C. Near isothermal decompression of this rock resulted in the breakdown of phengite associated with a pervasive recrystallization of the rock. The same terrain also contains mica schists that experienced peak conditions close {{to those of the}} diamond-bearing rocks, but they were exhumed along a cooler path where phengite remained stable. In these rocks, major and trace element zoning in garnet has been completely equilibrated. A layered gneiss was metamorphosed at UHP conditions in the coesite field, but did not reach diamond-facies conditions (peak conditions: 30 kbar and 800 – 900 °C). In this sample, garnet records retrograde zonation in major elements and also retains prograde zoning in trace elements. A garnet-kyanite-micaschist that reached significantly lower pressures (24 ± 2 kbar, 710 ± 20 °C) contains garnet with major and trace element zoning. The diverse garnet zoning in samples that experienced different metamorphic conditions allows to establish that diffusional equilibration of rare earth element in garnet likely occurs at 900 – 950 °C. Different metamorphic conditions in the four investigated samples are also documented in zircon trace element zonation and mineral inclusions in zircon and monazite. U-Pb geochronology of metamorphic zircon and monazite domains demonstrates that prograde (528 – 521 Ma), peak (528 – 522 Ma), and peak to retrograde metamorphism (503 – 532 Ma) occurred over a relatively short time interval that is indistinguishable from metamorphism of other UHP rocks within the Kokchetav metamorphic <b>belt.</b> Therefore, the <b>assembly</b> of rocks with contrasting P-T trajectories must have occurred in a single subduction-exhumation cycle, providing a snapshot of the thermal structure of a subducted continental margin prior to collision. The rocks were initially buried along a low geothermal gradient. At 20 – 25 kbar they underwent near isobaric heating of 200 °C, which was followed by continued burial along a low geothermal gradient. Such a step-wise geotherm is in good agreement with predictions from subduction zone thermal models...|$|R
