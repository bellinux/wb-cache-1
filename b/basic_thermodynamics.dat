In <b>basic</b> <b>thermodynamics</b> problems, {{when using the}} canonical ensemble, the use of just one parameter [...] {{reflects the fact that}} there is only one expectation value that must be held constant: the free energy (due to conservation of energy). For chemistry problems involving chemical reactions, the grand canonical ensemble provides the appropriate foundation, and there are two Lagrange multipliers. One is to hold the energy constant, and another, the fugacity, is to hold the particle count constant (as chemical reactions involve the recombination of a fixed number of atoms).|$|E

40|$|Entropy bounds {{in black}} hole physics, {{based on a}} wide variety of {{different}} approaches, have had a long and distinguished history. Recently the current authors have turned attention to uncollapsed systems and obtained a robust entropy bound for uncollapsed static spherically symmetric configurations. In the current article we extend this bound to rotating systems. This extension is less simple than one might at first suppose. Purely classically, (using only classical general relativity and <b>basic</b> <b>thermodynamics),</b> it is possible to show that the entropy of uncollapsed matter inside a region enclosed by a surface of area A is bounded from above by S = max kappa(FIDOs) / (2 pi).
