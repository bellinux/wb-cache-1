40|$|<b>Bridges</b> <b>and</b> routers {{are used}} to {{interconnect}} Local Area Networks (LANs). The performance of these devices is important since they can become bottlenecks in large multi-segment networks. Performance metrics and test methodology for <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> routers were not standardized. Performance data reported by vendors is not applicable to the actual scenarios encountered in an operational network. However, vendor-provided data {{can be used to}} calibrate models of <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> routers that, along with other models, yield performance data for a network. Several tools are available for modeling <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> routers - Network II. 5 was used. The results of the analysis of some <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> routers are presented...|$|R

5|$|On July2, 1935, the Rip Van Winkle Bridge {{over the}} Hudson River between Catskill and Greenport was opened to traffic. It {{became part of}} a realigned NY23 after the Athens–Hudson ferry shut down in the late 1940s. NY23 {{utilized}} modern NY23B between the <b>bridge</b> <b>and</b> Hudson. Plans {{were made in the}} early 1950s to construct a southern bypass of the city of Hudson between the Rip Van Winkle <b>Bridge</b> <b>and</b> NY23 midway between Claverack and Hollowville. Construction on the portion of the highway between the <b>bridge</b> <b>and</b> US9 south of Hudson began in the mid-1950s and was completed in the late 1950s as a realignment of NY23. Ultimately, this was the only section that was built; as a result, NY23 overlapped with US9 and NY9H to reach its former alignment in Claverack.|$|E

50|$|The combat {{engineer}} {{unit was}} organized and trained to transport and maintain its stream-crossing equipage, to construct floating <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> rafts with this equipage, to guard <b>and</b> maintain completed <b>bridges,</b> to regulate traffic thereon, <b>and</b> to dismantle <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> rafts.

5|$|Some {{international}} airports require {{construction of}} additional infrastructure {{outside of the}} airport, such as at the Hong Kong International Airport, which included {{the construction of a}} high-speed railway and automobile expressway to connect the airport to the urban areas of Hong Kong. Construction of the expressway included the construction of two bridges (the Tsing Ma suspension <b>bridge</b> <b>and</b> Kap Shui Mun cable <b>bridge)</b> <b>and</b> the Ma Wan viaduct on Ma Wan island to connect the bridges. Each bridge carries rail and automobile traffic.|$|E

50|$|Towers {{can also}} be used to support <b>bridges,</b> <b>and</b> can reach heights that rival some of the tallest {{buildings}} above-water. Their use is most prevalent in suspension <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> cable-stayed <b>bridges.</b> The use of the pylon, a simple tower structure, has also helped to build railroad <b>bridges,</b> mass-transit systems, <b>and</b> harbors.|$|R

5|$|A wooden {{bridge was}} {{built over the}} Kennet at Newbury in 1726, {{replaced}} in stone between 1769 and 1772 by James Clarke, and {{now known as the}} Town Bridge or Water Bridge. As there is no tow path, a line to haul the barge had to be floated under the <b>bridge</b> <b>and</b> then re-attached to the horse where the tow path resumed.|$|E
5|$|A. L. Dolby & Company was {{contracted}} {{to complete the}} rail line between the <b>bridge</b> <b>and</b> Kingston. The track reached the Kingston Union Station in November 1872. By this time, trains were running regularly to and from Kingston.|$|E
5000|$|Although <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> tunnels are not streets, rails {{can still}} be {{embedded}} in the surface of <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> tunnels like the Inuyama Bridge (Japan) or the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel (US). This is also considered to be [...] "street running".|$|R
50|$|<b>Bridges</b> <b>and</b> {{overpasses}} can {{be especially}} dangerous. Black ice forms first on <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> overpasses because air can circulate both {{above and below the}} surface of the elevated roadway when the ambient temperature drops, causing the bridge pavement temperature to fall more rapidly.|$|R
