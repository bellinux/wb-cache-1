50|$|The term Nelson-based {{lends itself}} from the Nelson Paint Company and its first marker, the Nel-Spot 007. The basic valve design found in these early markers {{laid the groundwork for}} many other {{manufacturers}} to develop their own paintball guns. The Nelson design is in-line which means that the bolt, hammer, and valve follow the barrel and form a line as opposed to being stacked. It fires from a closed bolt position meaning that when it fires the bolt is secured into the breech end of the barrel with a paintball loaded. In comparison, the bolt in an open bolt marker is not secured until the marker fires, at which point the paintball is chambered, fired, and the bolt is then re-opened. Another characteristic of the Phantom that varies within the Nelson-based family of markers is that it features the original breech drop design as opposed to the <b>bore</b> drop <b>variation</b> of the design, meaning that the paintballs drop into breech, or rear of the barrel, rather than dropping into the bore of the barrel.|$|R

In this study, hydraulic experiments were carried out to clarify a tsunami wave load on a bridge deck, focusing on the effect of the type of breaker bores on the induced drag coefficient, and the variation of horizontal wave force effected by the changes of deck position from still water level against tsunami height. The averaged values CD of averaged drag coefficient were calculated as 1. 52 subjected to surging breaker bores, and as 1. 56 subjected to plunging breaker <b>bores.</b> The <b>variation</b> of horizontal wave force is more sensitive in the case that still water level is lower, and in the case that a bridge deck is subjected to plunging breaker bores.

Optimal Horizontal length is estimated through economic analysis i. e. Net present Value of the project (NPV). Well construction costs including incremental costs of drilling horizontal section, friction losses in horizontal section, Hydrocarbon prices and Drainage area affect NPV. This thesis work estimates NPV and Productivity Indices of horizontal well projects with the use of simulation results under operating conditions of draw drawdown limits and constant Bottom hole flowing pressures using Finite conductivity concept. Horizontal wells assuming frictionless wellbores are also discussed. The results of NPV and PI are used to estimate the optimal length of horizontal wellbore in this work. Relatively shorter well lengths were found to be more economical than the lengthier ones in every case. Well bore flow rates of 1600 stb/day in the case of well <b>bore</b> roughness <b>variation</b> didn t decrease productivity to high extent.

40|$|The coastal {{township}} of Whangamata's reticulated {{water supply}} {{is provided by}} a number of groundwater bores, extracting water from local fractured rhyolite and andesite aquifers. A need has arisen to create a greater understanding of the aquifers, because of an increased demand for water abstraction. Water demand in Whangamata increases dramatically during the summer vacation period. Occupant numbers increase from 4, 000 up to 50, 000 during peak times, resulting in increased water demand. Over the past five years an increase in groundwater abstraction has produced an evident downward trend in bore water levels. Electrical conductivity is also increasing in several aquifers, posing a realistic threat of sea water intrusion and questioning the sustainability of current abstraction volumes. Multiple linear regression and an artificial neural network model were investigated as simple empirical forecasting tools for well drawdowns to predict the effect of future increases in groundwater demand. This approach was adopted as opposed to a groundwater numerical model because of poor time resolution of available data and the complex, fractured nature of the aquifer. By using pumping volumes as variables, seasonal <b>bore</b> water level <b>variations</b> and long term trends were predicted. The models were evaluated with independent validation data sets. The actual ability of a model to predict bore water level seasonal variation and long term trends was assessed using a comparison with a moving average of the validation data set. Multiple linear regression proved superior to the neural network in almost every bore modelled. Although neural networks proved capable of modelling seasonal <b>bore</b> water level <b>variations</b> it was not to the same degree of accuracy as the regression approach. The regression approach yielded a modified index of agreement of 0. 6 - 0. 74 when comparing a moving average of observed data with the validation data sets.

However, improved mechanical properties of these materials limits us due to high cost of processing these materials. Spindle Load {{is one of the}} most important factors in machining operations of such materials and it is mainly affected by cutting conditions including the cutting speed, depth of cut, insert material and cooling environment along with length and diameter of the tool body. Machining manufacturing process are now moving towards automations. Therefore, Spindle Load monitoring is important to achieve an efficient manufacturing process.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of a hydraulic motor {{depends on the}} lubrication performance of the piston ring. If the film is too thin then wear occurs quickly, if it is too thick then oil is lost into the cylinder and efficiency is reduced. In this paper a technique for oil film measurement based on ultrasonic reflection is investigated. This {{has the potential to}} be used non-invasively on real components. An ultrasonic pulse will reflect from a thin film interposed between two solids. The proportion of the pulse that is reflected depends on the stiffness of the intermediate layer. If the acoustic properties of the film material are known, then the stiffness can readily be used to determine the film thickness. This principle has been employed for the piston ring lubrication case. A piston/cylinder test bench has been used to evaluate the ultrasonic method. A focusing piezo-electric transducer is mounted outside the cylinder and ultrasonic pulses reflected back from the inner <b>bore.</b> The <b>variation</b> of these pulses as the piston ring passes underneath is investigated and used to determine oil film thickness. Films in the range 0. 7 to 1. 3 Î¼m were measured; the thickness did not depend strongly on either ring speed or sealed pressure. Several practical aspects were investigated such as, attenuation in the cylinder material, response time, and transducer resolution. Whilst this study demonstrated that film thickness measurement is feasible, there are a number of practical considerations that require further work, principally the focusing and coupling of the ultrasonic transducer and the response time...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES My {{topic of}} {{research}} is a comparative study of ethnicity and (selected) health patterns among second generation Poles (and to a lesser extent, first generation Poles), looked at by means of two case studies, one in the UK {{and one in the}} USA. I examine the level of ethnicity (cultural) maintenance in a white - assumed assimilated - minority ethnic group in two specific geographic locations and therefore the context specific nature of ethnicity maintenance. I also examine whether it is possible {{to assess the impact of}} such maintenance on their personal health, well-being, and quality of life. METHODS My research design includes a (smaller, post WWII) selection of first generation UK and USA Polish respondents who act as point of reference, and allow me to define within this study, the parameters of the cultural 'nuances' in question. My design allows for the assessment of any evidence of ethnic self-identity and a common sub-cultural identity, as well as any differences between the two groups of respondents in relation to their respective degrees of co-operation, and accommodation problems, with host groups. The collection of data is operationalized via multiple methods, including questionnaires. I employ the use of qualitative, quantitative, and ethnographic elements, thus allowing for multidimensional analysis of selected issues. Comparisons are made with extant data from both the host (indigenous) communities. RESULTS/CONCLUSION Empirical results <b>bore</b> out <b>variations</b> in the degree of maintained ethnic lifestyles, across a range of social groups. Some of the differences can be explained by the different environments (UK and USA), as well as the diasporic nature of the first generation's immigration experiences. Qualitative and ethnographic evidence was found to be crucial in explaining the various affective ethnic nuances that quantitative methods are unable to reveal, such as the pervasive impact that the first generation's diasporic experiences, as well as the nature of the Polish exiled community, have had on the second generation, both in the UK and the USA, and their respective qualities of life. This study has indicated that maintaining one's ethnic roots can for these individuals be just as problematic, although in differing ways, as for members of non-white ethnic minorities...|$|R

Tool life {{is one of the most}} important factors in machining operations of such materials and it is mainly affected by cutting conditions including the cutting speed, depth of cut, insert material and cooling environment along with length and diameter of the tool body. In addition, the modern industry is moving towards automating the manufacturing processes. Therefore, tool life monitoring is important to achieve an efficient manufacturing process. In this study, a tool wear prediction model during the boring machining operation of gray cast iron is studied. It is based on the monitoring of tool performance in controlled machining tests with measurements of tool life, surface finish, <b>bore</b> size <b>variation,</b> cutting time and load on spindle in terms of % current under different combinations of cutting parameters (cutting speed, depth of cut, tool nose radius, length & diameter of tool, tool material and coolant pressure & concentration). The influence of cutting parameters on the tool life was studied experimentally by performing more than 120 cutting tests. A prediction model was then developed to predict tool wear. The basic steps used in generating the model adopted in the development of the prediction model are: collection of data; analysis, pre-processing and feature extraction of the data, design of the prediction model, training of the model and finally testing the model to validate the results and its ability to predict tool wear. The evolution of boring machining operation properties using different parameters is a complex phenomenon. There are many factors (like cutting speed, depth of cut, insert material and cooling environment along with length and diameter of the tool bodyaffecting the performance of cast iron boring machining operation resulting to poor tool life.

The process parameters grouped in π terms were suggested the effective guidelines to the manufacturer for improving tool life by changing any one or all from theavailable process parameters...|$|R
40|$|A {{traditional}} approach to increasing fatigue resistance of many assemblies involves {{the creation of}} regions of compressive residual stress. For example, riveting holes used in modern passenger aircraft are currently subjected to cold expansion using split mandrel tools. The method is relatively expensive and not entirely problem-free. In the present study we consider a method of creating residual stresses around drilled holes referred to as 'dimpling', that itself is a variation of a novel technique known as the StressWave™ process. An experimental procedure is described {{for the creation of}} localised regions of significant plastic deformation and residual stress by 'dimpling', allowing the production of cold-worked and residually-stressed specimens. The overall aims of this study were to determine thickness-average residual stesses by two different techniques, namely, one destructive technique (Sachs boring) and one non-destructive (high energy X-ray diffraction); and to compare the results. In Sachs <b>boring</b> experiments the <b>variation</b> of strain gauge readings with increasing diameter of the central hole was recorded. A classical elastic-ideally plastic axisymmetric model for plane stress conditions was used in the analysis. Energy dispersive synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments were performed for non-destructive assessment of residual elastic strains. The two different stress evaluation techniques used in this project led to consistent results. Good correlation was found between the stresses obtained from X-ray diffraction results and those deduced from Sachs boring experiments.

This Conference was a join activity with COST Action 924. Biological variance is omnipresent. In animals, in humans, in biology, in sociology, medicine, you name it. In fact, life would be utterly <b>boring</b> without biological <b>variation.</b> Also in agricultural and horticultural produce, the ubiquitous variation causes {{a lot of trouble}} in dealing with the product in the supply chain. Basically, the majority of troubles and problems in the food production and supply chain is {{in one way or another}} related to the presence of variation between entities like individuals, up to batches, pallet loads, orchards and harvests, and down to cells and organelles. Many modern measuring techniques make it possible to analyse product entities without destroying the samples. These gathered, so-called longitudinal data, offer many advantages for extracting information. By using these techniques, it becomes possible to follow individual units (batches, fruit etc.) in time, and estimate the kinetics of change in (any) properties on an individual level. Destructively obtained data (cross-sectional data) can only be analysed at the level of mean values, neglecting completely the information on variance contained in data. Explained parts of data analysis con increase from 60 - 70 % obtained on cross-sectional data to well over 90 % obtained on longitudinal data, with the quantification of the biological variance present. The analysis of longitudinal data, however, requires a special approach and the use of special analysing techniques. The benefits of longitudinal data and their analysis using mixed effect non linear regression for extracting information on maturity and biological variance within a batch, is highlighted based on a large number of examples, already published or in preparation, covering the colour and firmness of nectarines, water loss in plums, mandarins and melons, firmness in Near Isogenic Lines of melons, colour of apples in storage and during growth.
