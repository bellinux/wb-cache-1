This section was an extension of the earlier Victoria Bridge project.Three years later, the Ulverstone bypass was completed and opened to traffic in August 1980.The duplication of the highway from Wivenhoe, east of Burnie, to Chasm Creek was completed during the 1983-84 financial year, and was followed in May 1984 with the opening of 500 metres of ‘stage B' of the Burnie Highway System. This section duplicated the highway along North Terrace. In September 1986, all four lanes over the complete length of ‘stage B’ of the ‘Burnie Expressway’ (‘Burnie Highway System’) were brought into operation.Throughout 1986 and 1987, sections of the highway were progressively duplicated and opened to traffic between Don (Devonport) and the Forth River, with the last section completed in June 1987. This was followed by completion of duplication between Forth River and Ulverstone in late 1987.In 1988, at the eastern terminus of the Bass Highway, a new alignment was opened to connect directly to the then new Launceston Southern Outlet, which itself had opened to traffic in 1985.

An analytical model of a generalized four-stage suspension cyclone preheater system is presented.

As the bypass size (percentage) was varied, the heat content of the bypass gas was calculated for different constant calcination degrees.

Changing the calcination degree to 50 % and bypass percentage to 40 % resulted in gas heats of: 541. 4, 801. 0, 1033. 2 and 1191. 5 kJ, respectively for each cyclone.

A system of locating devices was placed on the barge to translate target coordinates back to a stationary reference frame for locating fish relative to the dam.

The tracking software integrates data from the two multibeam systems and accommodates both automatic and manual processing of the data. Visualization software provides a reconstruction of the fish tracks to study entrainment behavior. Fish swimming straight into a bypass or guidance opening, or instead milling about, can also be distinguished with a simple quantitative metric called the tortuosity index.

METHODS: Transmitral inflow patterns were studied by transoesophageal Doppler echocardiography in 43 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery without cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> after <b>opening</b> of the sternum (baseline) and during grafting of the left anterior descending artery. Peak early (E) and peak late (A) transmitral velocities and their ratio (E/A) were recorded. Myocardial ischaemia was defined by standard criteria using two-dimensional echocardiography and seven-lead electrocardiogram. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (64 +/- 8 yr, 9 women) fulfilled the predefined inclusion criteria for analysis. During distal revascularization, 16 patients showed myocardial ischaemia and 15 did not. The use of vasoactive drugs, haemodynamic findings and transmitral inflow patterns were similar in both groups at baseline and during grafting. In the ischaemic group, E was 67. 1 +/- 13. 9 cm s- 1 at baseline and 69. 5 +/- 23. 2 cm s- 1 during grafting, and the E/A ratios were 1. 3 +/- 0. 3 and 1. 4 +/- 0. 9, respectively. In the non-ischaemic group, E was 64. 0 +/- 17. 1 cm s- 1 at baseline and 60. 9 +/- 14. 8 cm s- 1 during grafting, and the E/A ratios were 1. 4 +/- 0. 7 and 1. 2 +/- 0. 3, respectively.

40|$|Abstract: Traditional {{downstream}} {{guidance and}} bypass facilities for anadromous fishes (surface bypasses, surface guidance structures, and behavioral barriers) have typically been ineffective for anguillid eels. Because eels typically spend {{the majority of}} their time near the bottom in forebay environments, deep bypass entrance structures with bottom entrances hold some promise for increased effectiveness as protection measures for this species. A new design of deep-entrance bypass system that uses airlift technology (the Conte Airlift Bypass) to induce flow in a bypass pipe was hydraulically and biologically tested in a simulated forebay environment under controlled laboratory conditions. Water velocities of 0. 9 to 1. 5 m/sec could be generated at the <b>bypass</b> entrance (<b>opening</b> with 0. 073 m 2 area), with corresponding flows of 0. 07 to 0. 11 m 3 /sec. Gas saturation and hydrostatic pressure within the bypass pipe did not vary appreciably from a control (no air) condition under tested airflows. Migratory silver-phase American eels (Anguilla rostrata) tested at night under dark conditions readily located, entered, and passed the bypass; initial avoidance rates (fish avoiding entrainment into the entrance) were lower at higher entrance velocities. Fish that entered the bypass pipe tended to enter headfirst, but those fish that then exited the pipe upstream (rejected the bypass) did so more frequently at lower entrance velocities. Eels appeared to swim against the flow while being transported downstream through the pipe; median transit times for each test velocity ranged from 5. 8 to 13. 7 sec, with transit time decreasing with increasing entrance velocity. There was no strong avoidance of the vertical section of the pipe which contained injected air. No mortality or injury of bypassed eels was observed, and individual eels repeatedly passed through the bypass at rates of up to 30 passes per hour, suggesting that individuals do not avoid repeated entrainment through the bypass...|$|R

The generation of a unidirectional airflow through the parabronchi in a bidirectionally ventilated organ could be explained by the existence of anatomical valves that open and close in phase with the breathing cycle. Indeed, succumbing to such appealing conceptual reasoning, certain early authors such as Brandes (1924), Bethe (1925) and Dotterweich (1930, 1933) regarded the airflow in a bird’s lung to be produced by alternating mechanical opening and closing of several valves...|$|R
