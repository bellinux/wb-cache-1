5|$|Bacteriophages are {{viruses that}} infect {{bacteria}} and archaea. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses officially recognises 28 genera of bacteriophages {{that belong to}} 11 families. They are important in marine ecology: as the infected bacteria burst, carbon compounds are released back into the environment, which stimulates fresh organic growth. Bacteriophages are useful in scientific research because they are harmless to humans and can be studied easily. These viruses can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> industries that produce food and drugs by fermentation and depend on healthy bacteria. Some bacterial infections are becoming difficult to control with antibiotics, {{so there is a}} growing interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat infections in humans.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) {{established}} ten {{camps in}} Moshannon State Forest, and ten in Elk State Forest. The {{young men of}} the CCC planted trees, blazed new trails, built roads and bridges, and fought fires, which continued to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b> <b>In</b> 1938 a fast-moving fire in the Elk State Forest, north of Quehanna, killed eight firefighters. The CCC also built structures and established or improved many of the state parks, including Parker Dam and S. B. Elliott State Parks on the western Quehanna plateau. The United States' entry into World War II ended the CCC, and all its camps were closed {{by the summer of}} 1942. The Quehanna Trail System passes near or through the sites of several former CCC camps.|$|E

5|$|Consisting of Ottoman, Arab and Circassian soldiers, the II Corps {{had three}} options: to {{pass to the}} east of Amman along the Darb el Haj direct to Damascus, {{although}} water would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> that desert region, to attack Chaytor's Force at Amman, or to move westwards, to try to get to the Jordan Valley. Patterson's Column was ordered to entrench Shunet Nimrin, Es Salt and Suweileh in case they moved westwards. On the Royal Fusiliers' right the 2nd Light Horse Brigade closely guarded the country to the south, in particular the Madaba to Naur to Ain Hummar road across the plateau, with a strong detachment occupying Ain es Sir. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade sent a detachment at about midday on 26 September to investigate a report of Ottoman and German soldiers with guns at Er Rumman, but none were found. They subsequently sent a second detachment east of Amman to watch the Darb el Haj. The 20th Indian Brigade of infantry arrived after dark on 26 September to take over garrison duties at Amman.|$|E

The building of a stronger and more understanding community could help to prevent social chaos arising between the two groups.
