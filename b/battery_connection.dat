40|$|Large {{stationary}} battery plants are reliect upon to deliver emergency power to mission critical equipment {{ranging from a}} few seconds to many hours. The discharge rate and specific load at which they are discharged ultimately determines the actual current demanded of them. Power engineers and system designers strive to make the best material and economic choices to satisfy the needs of the system. From tlle maintenance perspective, maintaining reliable connection integrity should be considered paramount in operating a reliable battery plant. This paper will explore the fundamentals of establishing, tracking and maintaining connection integrity for large {{stationary battery}} plants and discuss the resulting effects of neglecting to address the requirements established by the industry. Basic Premise Users of stationary batteries expect a high degree of reliability from their battery plants. A major factor concerning connection integrity focuses on the need for reliable, trouble free connections. Additionally, a minimum amount of voltage drop, hence low power dissipation is desirable during periods of battery discharge. Among several methods, two are popular that have been employed to determine <b>battery</b> <b>connection</b> integrity. Method one involves measuring the voltage drop across each bolted connection during a test discharge. Method two employs the use of an instrument known as a micro-ohmmeter. This paper will deal with the latter of the two measurement methods described and techniques used to track the data take...|$|E

40|$|Dear Sir or Madam: The {{purpose of}} this letter is for the Nebraska Public Power District (NPPD) to request an {{amendment}} to Facility Operating License DPR- 46 in accordance with 'the provisions of 10 CFR 50. 4 and 10 CFR 50. 90 to revise the Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) Technical Specifications (TS). The license amendment request proposes to revise two TS Surveillance Requirements (SRs) that have been determined to be nonconservative. The nonconservative SRs are SR 3. 8. 4. 2 and SR 3. 8. 4. 5 in TS Section 3. 8. 4, "DC Sources- Operating". The SRs verify that <b>battery</b> <b>connection</b> resistance is less than specified limits for the individual parts of the battery. However, the total resistance of the battery, as determined by summing the values of resistance for these individual parts, could exceed the value of total battery resistance reflected in the load and voltage study calculations. Site procedures have administrative limits of 50 micro-ohms (gQ) that have been sufficient to preclude battery resistance values exceeding design calculation limits. As an enhancement to the surveillance procedure, total battery resistance was added to address the TS non-conservatism. This continues to ensure the batteries are able to perform their safety function and that continued operation of CNS is conservative. Attachment 1 provides {{a description of the}} TS changes, the basis for the amendment, the no significant hazards consideration evaluation pursuant to 10 CFR 50. 91 (a) (1), and the environmental impact evaluation pursuant to 10 CFR 51. 22.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} Renewable Energy Integration Problem, and proposes a Genetic Algorithm embedded with a Monte Carlo simulation to solve large instances {{of the problem}} that are impractical to solve via full enumeration. The Renewable Energy Integration Problem is defined as finding the optimum set of components to supply the electric demand to a hybrid microgrid. The components considered are solar panels, wind turbines, diesel generators, electric <b>batteries,</b> <b>connections</b> to the power grid and converters, which can be inverters and/or rectifiers. The methodology developed is explained {{as well as the}} combinatorial formulation. In addition, 2 case studies of a single objective optimization version of the problem are presented, in order to minimize cost and to minimize global warming potential (GWP) followed by a multi-objective implementation of the offered methodology, by utilizing a non-sorting Genetic Algorithm embedded with a monte Carlo Simulation. The method is validated by solving a small instance of the problem with known solution via a full enumeration algorithm developed by NREL in their software HOMER. The dissertation concludes that the evolutionary algorithms embedded with Monte Carlo simulation namely modified Genetic Algorithms are an efficient form of solving the problem, by finding approximate solutions in the case of single objective optimization, and by approximating the true Pareto front in the case of multiple objective optimization of the Renewable Energy Integration Problem. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} mimic the tactile {{feedback}} exhibited by the human hand in an artificial limb is considered advantageous in the automatic control of new multifunctional prosthetic hands. The role of a slip sensor in this tactile feedback is to detect object slip and thus provide information to a controller, which automatically adjusts the grip force applied to a held object {{to prevent it from}} falling. This system reduces the cognitive load experienced by the user by not having to visually assess the stability of an object, as well as giving them the confidence not to apply unnecessarily excessive grip forces. A candidate for such a sensor is a thick-film piezoelectric sensor. The method of fabricating a thick-film piezoelectric slip sensor on a prototype fingertip is described. The construction of experimental apparatus to mimic slip has been designed and analysed to allow the coefficient of friction between the fingertip and the material in contact with the fingertip to be calculated. Finally, results show that for a coefficient of friction between the fingertip and grade P 100 sandpaper of approximately 0. 3, an object velocity of 0. 025 ± 0. 008 ms- 1 was reached before a slip signal from the piezoelectric sensor was able to be used to detect slip. It is anticipated that this limiting velocity will be lowered (improved) in the intended application where the sensor electronics will be powered from a <b>battery,</b> <b>connections</b> will be appropriately screened and if necessary a filter employed.

During their operation, solid intermetallic phases often {{form in the}} cathode and are known to limit {{the capacity of the}} cell.

Even though it is desirable that the system work properly each and every time it is called into use, some failures are bound to occur.

An extra hour spent at an installation site can save many maintenance trips and many frustrating hours of system troubleshooting. Typical faults likely to cause communication outrage are Pager phone systems Poor splices aggravated by corrosion. Strain relief not provided. Drip loop not provided. Incorrect branch connections.

Carrier phones Mounting transceiver near load resistors or other sources of heat. Tracks not electrically bonded. Cable abrasion due to poor mounting location. Disconnected battery.

Remember the adage, "Whatever can go wrong, will. " Preventive measures taken during installation will pay off in the long run. 6. 2 Pager Phone Installation The pager phones used in many underground coal mines are battery-operated, party-line telephones with provisions for loudspeaker paging.

5000|$|In many {{municipalities}} {{across the}} United States, {{policies have been}} adopted to fine home and business owners for multiple false alarm activations from their security system. If multiple false alarms from the same property persist, that property could even be added to a [...] "no response" [...] list, which bars police dispatch to the property except {{in the event of}} verified emergency. Approximately 1% of police alarm calls actually involve a crime. Nuisance alarms occur when an unintended event evokes an alarm status by an otherwise properly working alarm system. A false alarm also occurs when there is an alarm system malfunction that results in an alarm state. In all three circumstances, the source of the problem should be immediately found and fixed, so that responders will not lose confidence in the alarm reports. It is easier to know when there are false alarms, because the system is designed to react to that condition. Failure alarms are more troublesome because they usually require periodic testing to make sure the sensors are working and that the correct signals are getting through to the monitor. Some systems are designed to detect problems internally, such as low or dead <b>batteries,</b> loose <b>connections,</b> phone circuit trouble, etc. While earlier nuisance alarms could be set off by small disturbances, like insects or pets, newer model alarms have technology to measure the size/weight of the object causing the disturbance, and thus are able to decide how serious the threat is, which is especially useful in burglar alarms.|$|R
