5|$|Three days of {{cold weather}} and rain preceded the offensive. On 15 April Lieutenant Colonel Edmond Van der Meersch led {{an attack on}} the brook. One Belgian {{lieutenant}} went scouting alone in no man's land and was killed in an ambush. A Belgian sergeant caught three Italian officers at gunpoint but lowered his revolver when they claimed to be English, thinking the KAR might have dispatched a liaison party to the area. He was then shot by snipers concealed in the <b>bush.</b> <b>A</b> battle ensued in which four Congolese soldiers were lost. Three Italians and an estimated 40 Eritrean ascari were killed, with approximately 70 ascari wounded.|$|E
5|$|Cape sparrows {{primarily}} eat seeds, {{and also}} eat soft plant parts and insects. They typically breed in colonies, and when not breeding they gather in large nomadic flocks {{to move around}} in search of food. The nest can be constructed in a tree, a <b>bush,</b> <b>a</b> cavity, or a disused nest of another species. A typical clutch contains three or four eggs, and both parents are involved in breeding, from nest building to feeding young. The Cape sparrow is common in most of its range and coexists successfully in urban habitats with two of its relatives, the native southern grey-headed sparrow and the house sparrow, an introduced species. The Cape sparrow's population has not been recorded decreasing significantly, {{and it is not}} seriously threatened by human activities, so it is assessed as a species of least concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Devil Daggers was {{developed}} by Sorath, a Melbourne-based independent video game developer. The development group was formed by Matt <b>Bush,</b> <b>a</b> member of Dustforce creators Hitbox Team. The game's art direction and rendering engine were designed to reimagine the aesthetics and graphical style of video games from the 1990s. This was achieved by making use of unfiltered textures, jagged 3D models, and the deliberate implementation of polygon jitter and texture warping found in early 3D games. Jitter and warping were often considered technical flaws of PlayStation games; however, the recreation of these effects in Devil Daggers is to make enemies shudder and ripple during movement. Enemy designs are hellish, with some entities taking the form of insectoids with skeletal features. Audio is composed largely of distorted and abstract sounds with compressed, digitised screams used to produce unsettling noises for the creatures.|$|E

Previously known as Melaani Drive, the street links the Georgian capital's airport with the city center and was used by Bush's motorcade during his visit four months earlier. A street in Tirana, formerly known as Rruga Puntorët e Rilendjes, situated directly outside the Albanian Parliament, was renamed after <b>Bush</b> <b>a</b> few days before he made the first-ever visit by an American president to Albania in June 2007.

5|$|The Waikato Māori had {{withdrawn}} to fortified positions at Pikopiko and Paterangi by early 1864. While their positions were under siege, war parties would mount raids on {{small groups of}} British soldiers. On 11 February, soldiers of the 40th Regiment of Foot were bathing in the Mangapiko Stream near Paterangi and were ambushed by a raiding party. Heaphy, commanding some men of the 50th Regiment of Foot, came {{to the aid of}} the defenders and moved to cut off the Māori line of retreat. He then overcame the Māori reserve, before leading his men to the ambush site, to assist the British soldiers. Despite being outnumbered, the British repulsed the Māori and began to pursue them into the <b>bush.</b> <b>A</b> soldier was wounded and Heaphy and three others went to his aid but Heaphy and one of the others were wounded and a third was killed. Unable to extricate themselves, Heaphy and the remaining fit soldier provided cover to prevent the wounded men from being axed by the Māori. They were eventually relieved by reinforcements but the two wounded men that Heaphy and the soldier were trying to protect, died of their wounds. Despite injuries to his arm, hip and ribs, Heaphy remained in the field for much of the remainder of the day, until the ambushed party was relieved. Following the action at Paterangi, Heaphy was promoted to major; a month later, {{with the end of the}} war in the Waikato, he ceased active duty and returned to civilian life.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>bushing,</b> {{also known}} as <b>a</b> <b>bush,</b> is <b>an</b> {{independent}} plain bearing that is inserted into a housing to provide a bearing surface for rotary applications; {{this is the most}} common form of a plain bearing. Common designs include solid (sleeve and flanged), split, and clenched bushings. A sleeve, split, or clenched <b>bushing</b> is only <b>a</b> [...] "sleeve" [...] of material with an inner diameter (ID), outer diameter (OD), and length. The difference between the three types is that <b>a</b> solid sleeved <b>bushing</b> is solid all the way around, <b>a</b> split <b>bushing</b> has <b>a</b> cut along its length, and a clenched bearing is similar to <b>a</b> split <b>bushing</b> but with <b>a</b> [...] (or [...] ) across the cut. <b>A</b> flanged <b>bushing</b> is <b>a</b> sleeve <b>bushing</b> with <b>a</b> flange at one end extending radially outward from the OD. The flange is used to positively locate the bushing when it is installed or to provide a thrust bearing surface.|$|R

25|$|The {{presidency}} of George H. W. Bush began at noon EST on January 20, 1989, when George H. W.

He {{was the first}} sitting Vice President to be elected president since Martin Van Buren in 1836. Later, Bush, the 41st President, and his oldest son, George W. Bush, the country's 43rd (2001–2009), would become the second father and son pair to become President. (John Adams and John Quincy Adams were the first.)

Bush also attempted to lateral when he was tackled after a long run in the second quarter, but the lateral {{fell to the ground}} and was recovered by the Longhorns.
