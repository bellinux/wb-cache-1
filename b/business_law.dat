40|$|The {{evidence}} of {{developments in the}} harmonization of international <b>business</b> <b>laws</b> shows that Africa is lagging seriously behind. There are still some skeptical voices {{about the need for}} and the value of harmonization of international <b>business</b> <b>laws,</b> but such voices are now in a minority. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess the prospects for harmonizing international <b>business</b> <b>laws</b> in Africa. The main contention is that the debate today in Africa is not whether or not there should be harmonization of international <b>business</b> <b>laws,</b> but how this should be done. The paper reviews the imperatives for harmonization and the options that exist and then focuses on the present approach to harmonizing <b>business</b> <b>laws</b> in Africa under the auspices of the Organization for the Harmonization of <b>Business</b> <b>Laws</b> in Africa, better known under its French acronym, OHADA. Based on the critical review of the weaknesses and strengths of the OHADA regulatory framework, the paper suggests ways in which the agenda to develop a harmonized and modern set of <b>business</b> <b>laws</b> in Africa can be achieved.
