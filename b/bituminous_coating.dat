40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{dust explosion}} research conducted in an experimental mine {{and in a}} 20 -L laboratory chamber at the Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The primary purpose {{of this research is}} to improve safety in mining, but the data are also useful to other industries that manufacture, process, or use combustible dusts. Explosion characteristics such as the minimum explosible concentration and the rock dust inerting requirements were measured for various combustible dusts from the mining industries. These dusts included <b>bituminous</b> <b>coats,</b> gilsonite, oil shales, and sulfide ores. The full-scale tests were conducted in the Lake Lynn experimental mine of NIOSH. The mine tests were initiated by a methane-air explosion at the face (closed end) that both entrained and ignited the dust. The laboratory-scale tests were conducted in the 20 -L chamber using ignitors of various energies. One purpose of the laboratory and mine comparison is to determine the conditions under which the laboratory tests best simulate the full-scale tests. The results of this research showed relatively good agreement between the laboratory and the large-scale tests in determining explosion limits. Full-scale experiments in the experimental mine were also conducted to evaluate the explosion resistance characteristics of seals that are used to separate non-ventilated, inactive workings from active workings of a mine. Results of these explosion tests show significant increases in explosion overpressure due to added coal dust and indications of pressure piling...|$|R

5000|$|The {{cryogenic}} {{method was}} inadequate {{for the removal}} of the two final layers of <b>bituminous</b> <b>coating</b> that were {{below the surface of the}} seven layers of lead and vinyl based paints. A small yet powerful sandblasting tool that would sandblast and vacuum simultaneously was developed specifically {{for the removal of}} the stubborn coating. The tool devised by the Blast and Vac company of Bolivar, Ohio, was [...] "a standard blasting nozzle inside a vacuum cleaner head". A commercial grade bicarbonate of soda (baking soda), manufactured by Arm & Hammer was donated and applied as the cleaning agent that would be abrasive yet gentle on the copper sheathing. The baking soda leaked through the holes and crevices in the sheathing, and was affecting the coloration of the patina on the external side of the statue so the workers would rinse the outer surface of the statue, to prevent the baking soda from turning the green patina of the statue blue.|$|E

40|$|Two {{years ago}} when we {{completed}} the presentation of our first progress report on a survey of acid water and drainage installations, the Research Committee asked that the work be extended throughout the state. That has been done, and in addition a special test installation of p:i. pe in highly acid •rater has been an added feature of the project during the past 20 months. In total, approximately 16, 900 culverts on about 3, 520 miles of road were investigated, and over 350 field acidity measurements were made. With these studies and the information produced thus far by the test installation as a basis, J. H. Havens, Research Chemist, has pre-pared the attached report. Included •Ji th the data from our work is very valuable information about studies conducted in other states over the past 25 years (See page 37), and also some materi. al pertaining to cor-rosion in general as well as to corrosion in its relation to physio-graphic features of Kentucky. As a result of ail this evidence, some very definite conclu-sions have been dra•rn. These are enumerated, beginning on page 7 of the report. In essence, there is only one type of material (vitrified clay) now used in drainage pipe which is known to be absolutely resis-tant to acid corrosion. Other pipe at the test installation may be resistant enough to assure long life, but that can not be shown one way or another in an accelerated test. Corrugated metal pipe is wortltiess in the presence of acids, and concrete pipe is so severely affected by concentrated acids that it should be considered dependable for only 5 or 10 years under those conditions. The situation is uncertain with respect to <b>bituminous</b> <b>coated</b> metal pipe, but {{there is no doubt that}} the pipe i. s acid resis-tant as long as the coating remains intact...|$|R
40|$|As our nation’s {{highway system}} {{continues}} to age, asphalt maintenance and rehabilitation techniques {{have become increasingly}} important. The deterioration of pavement over time is inevitable. Preventive maintenance is a strategy to extend the serviceable life of a pavement by applying cost-effective treatments that slow the deterioration of pavement and extend its usable life. Thin maintenance surfaces (TMSs) are preventive maintenance techniques that can effectively prolong the life of pavement when applied at an opportune time. Common TMSs include bituminous fog seal, <b>bituminous</b> seal <b>coat,</b> slurry seal, cold in-place recycling (CIR), and micro-surfacing. This research project investigated ways to improve Iowa Statewide Urban Design and Specifications (SUDAS) and Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) documents regarding asphalt roadway maintenance and rehabilitation. Researchers led an effort to review and help ensure that the documents supporting proper selection, design, and construction for asphalt maintenance and rehabilitation techniques reflect the latest research findings on these processes: seal coating, slurry sealing, micro-surfacing, and fog sealing. Full results of this investigation are included in this report and its appendices. This report also presents {{a summary of the}} recommendations based on the study results...|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} several year Kossuth County has had a {{scheduled}} maintenance program of <b>bituminous</b> seal <b>coating.</b> This program {{has been used to}} maintain the 467 miles of asphaltic concrete surfaced roads in Kossuth County. Since most of the experience that Kossuth County had in seal coating was with cutback asphalt, it was decided to include the use of emulsified asphalt in Kossuth County's 1980 seal coat program. Federal Demonstration Project Funds were requested from the Federal Highway Administration to study the use of emulsified asphalt and funding was granted under Demonstration Project No. 55,:Asphalt Emulsions for Highway Construction. " Items studied were design and construction procedure cost of alternate material, energy consumption and environmental considerations. A construction contract was awarded to Everds Brothers, Inc. of Algona, Iowa, on July 1, 1980. There were four bidders on the 54. 5 miles of seal coating that was let. A map showing the location of the seal coating projects is shown in Appendix A, and a copy of the contract is shown in Appendix B. The contractor started the project on July 11, 1980 and completed the project on August 1, 1980. Construction inspection and follow-up inspections of the project were conducted by personnel of the Kossuth County Engineer's Office and testing of the materials, friction testing and road rater testing were conducted by the Material's Department of the Iowa Department of Transportation...|$|R

40|$|Although steel {{orthotropic}} deck {{is currently}} the most widely adopted solution for long-span bridges, the poor adhesion to the upper asphalt layers still represents a serious problem with a not clear solution. In recent decades many techniques, which involve the use of special <b>bituminous</b> bonding <b>coats,</b> reinforced asphalt membranes, net-reinforced steel deck surfaces or epoxy asphalt binders, have been applied, with varying results, to improve the level of adhesion of the asphalt pavement to the steel surface. In this experimental study two of such techniques were adopted in order to investigate the shear resistance of steel-asphalt pavement systems. The first technique uses epoxy asphalt both as a bonding coat and as a binder of the upper asphalt layer while the second technique concerns {{the use of a}} reinforced asphalt membrane that is applied on the steel deck before overlaying with conventional HMA. The ASTRA shear test device was used in order to evaluate the shear resistance of different types of HMA-steel interfaces and to investigate the effects of temperature and normal stress. The results have been compared with the shear properties of bitumen-coated interfaces, studied in a previous research. The results showed that epoxy asphalt guarantees high performance regardless of the test temperature. On the other hand, the shear resistance of the system with the asphalt membrane is lower than with the epoxy asphalt, although it is higher than the resistance of bitumen-coated interfaces at high temperatures...|$|R
40|$|A {{bituminous}} pavement is a multi-layered structure generally {{made up of}} surfacing, base and sub base courses on a sub grade. An interface {{is said to be}} a boundary between any two consecutive layers. So an adequate bond between the layers at the interfaces must be ensured so that multiple layers perform as a single composite structure. In case of non-bituminous layers or bituminous-non bituminous layers, adequate bond is established as such due to the mechanical interlocking between the aggregate surfaces. To increase the adhesion or bonding between two bituminous layers, <b>bituminous</b> tack <b>coats</b> are applied prior to overlay. This study is an attempt to evaluate the interface bond strength between two types of bituminous layer combinations in the laboratory. The cylindrical specimens have been tested for bond strength at four normal service temperatures, namely 250, 300, 350 and 400 C by applying different types of tack coat at varying application rates. Two types of layer combinations have been tried, namely (i) Bituminous Concrete (BC) layer on Dense Bituminous Macadam (DBM) samples and (ii) Semi Dense Bituminous Concrete (SDBC) layer on Bituminous Macadam (BM) samples. Similarly, different types of tack coat materials namely bitumen, Cationic Rapid Setting with low viscosity (CRS- 1) and Cationic Medium Setting with high viscosity (CMS- 2) emulsions have been used for the interface bond between the said bituminous layers. The samples thus prepared have then been tested on a specially fabricated attachment (named bond strength device) fixed to the loading frame of the Modified Marshall Testing Apparatus. It is observed that the interlayer bond strength depends on the test temperature and this decreases with increase in test temperature. It is also observed that the bond strength depends on the type of tack coat used and conditions of the type of combinations. The optimum amount of tack coat has been found to vary for tack coat type and layer combination type...|$|R
40|$|Proper surface {{preparation}} {{has been the}} key to obtain good performance by a surface coating. The major obstacle in preparing a corroded or rusted surface is the complete removal of the contaminants and the corrosion products. Sandblasting has been traditionally used to remove the corrosion products before painting. However, sandblasting can be expensive, may be prohibited by local health regulations and is not applicable in every situation. To get around these obstacles, Industry developed rust converters/rust transformers and rust compatible primers (high solids epoxies). The potential use of these products for military equipment led personnel of the Belvoir Research, Development and Engineering Center (BRDEC) to evaluate the commercially available rust transformers and rust compatible primers. Prior laboratory experience with commercially available rust converters, as well as field studies in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, revealed poor performance, several inherent limitations, and lack of reliability. It was obvious from our studies that the performance of rust converting products was more dependent on the amount and type of rust present, {{as well as the}} degree of permeability of the coating, than on the product's ability to form an organometallic complex with the rust. Based on these results, it was decided that the Military should develop their own rust converter formulation and specification. The compound described in the specification is for use on a rusted surface before the application of an organic <b>coating</b> (<b>bituminous</b> compounds, primer or topcoat). These coatings should end the need for sandblasting or the removing of the adherent corrosion products. They also will prepare the surface for the application of the organic coating. Several commercially available rust compatible primers (RCP) were also tested using corroded surfaces. All of the evaluated RCP failed our laboratory tests for primers...|$|R
