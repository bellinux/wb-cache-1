5|$|Among {{the many}} other {{statistics}} that are kept are those collectively known as situational statistics. For example, statistics can indicate which specific pitchers a certain <b>batter</b> performs best against. If a given situation statistically favors a certain <b>batter,</b> {{the manager of the}} fielding team {{may be more likely to}} change pitchers or have the pitcher intentionally walk the <b>batter</b> in order to face one who is less likely to succeed.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, {{a man in}} Portland, Oregon, invented an {{electric}} pancake machine that operated {{by the process of}} <b>batter</b> being dropped onto a revolving heated flattop grill from a storage cylinder atop the grill. The grill was heated using electricity. The amount of <b>batter</b> dropped was controlled by using controlled amounts of compressed air, which pushed <b>batter</b> out of the storage cylinder. As the <b>batter</b> revolved on the hot grill, the pancake was flipped halfway through the cooking process by a shelf atop the grill. After being flipped, the completed pancake was ejected from the machine upon contact with a gate.|$|E
5|$|Several basic {{offensive}} tactics {{come into}} play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base. The hit and run is sometimes employed with a skillful contact hitter: the runner takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating {{a gap in the}} infield for the <b>batter</b> to poke the ball through. The sacrifice bunt calls for the <b>batter</b> to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into scoring position even {{at the expense of the}} <b>batter</b> being thrown out at first—a <b>batter</b> who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice. (A <b>batter,</b> particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit.) A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a squeeze play. With a runner on third and fewer than two outs, a <b>batter</b> may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful <b>batter,</b> in this case, gets credit for a sacrifice fly. The manager will sometimes signal a <b>batter</b> who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch.|$|E

25|$|The <b>battered</b> person {{defense is}} a defense used {{in court that}} the person accused of an assault/murder was {{suffering}} from <b>battered</b> person syndrome at the material time.

5|$|The flyout: as {{described}} above, recorded against a <b>batter</b> who hits {{a ball in}} the air that is caught by a fielder, whether in fair territory or foul territory, before it lands, whether or not the <b>batter</b> has run.|$|E
5|$|A {{pitch that}} is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A <b>batter</b> against whom three strikes are {{recorded}} strikes out. A <b>batter</b> against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base. (A <b>batter</b> may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the <b>batter</b> does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee.|$|E

5|$|In {{some cases}} the {{official}} scorer is not given the discretion to decide between awarding a hit to the <b>batter</b> or ruling that he safely reached first base by fielder's choice. If a preceding runner is forced out or if an unforced preceding runner is put out while attempting {{to return to their}} original base, a hit is automatically not credited and the <b>batter</b> by rule is judged to have reached by a fielder's choice. In some situations this rule may appear unfair to the <b>batter.</b> For example, if the <b>batter</b> is a fast runner, the ball is slowly hit to the third baseman, and an unforced runner from second realizes (too late) that he can not safely advance, the batter-runner will lose the potential hit on a fielder's choice by the third baseman. This occurs regardless of whether the batter-runner would have reached first base with an ordinary effort to put him out.|$|E

40|$|Although widely {{misunderstood}} {{even among}} legal professionals, “battered woman syndrome ” {{is not a}} legal defense. It is one approach to explaining <b>battered</b> women’s experiences.

It was also the third time for a Tigers pitcher to come so close to a perfect game, as Milt Wilcox also missed getting the 27th {{straight}} <b>batter</b> out on April 15, 1983, and Tommy Bridges missed the 27th <b>batter</b> on August 5, 1932.|$|E
5|$|Various {{types of}} pancake {{machines}} exist, {{such as those}} that run pancake <b>batter</b> through a heated conveyor inside of a box unit, and those that automatically drop pancake <b>batter</b> onto a flattop grill. Some pancake machines, such as one developed by Crepe-Coer, cook both sides of a pancake simultaneously. Semi-automatic pancake machines also exist, which require some human interaction to function, such as the pouring of <b>batter.</b> Commercial pancake machines may be used in the foodservice industry, in cafeterias and by restaurants, and can serve to reduce the waste of stale pancake <b>batter.</b> Some hotels have pancake machines that guests are allowed to operate. They are also used in other environments in a self-service manner, such as in upscale airport lounges and hotels.|$|E
40|$|Current {{advocacy}} {{on behalf}} of <b>battered</b> women accused of criminal offenses focuses on the now familiar <b>battered</b> woman syndrome theory. Although the <b>battered</b> woman syndrome theory has enjoyed broad support when asserted by defendants claiming self-defense, the earnestness of the theory 2 ̆ 7 s judicial acceptance is questionable. First, in light of both empirical and analytical flaws in the <b>battered</b> woman syndrome theory, the overwhelming judicial acceptance of the theory is inconsistent with courts 2 ̆ 7 growing tendency to scrutinize scientific evidence. Second, courts {{have been reluctant to}} extend the <b>battered</b> woman syndrome theory to the defense of duress, where the theory would excuse <b>battered</b> women who commit crimes with their batterers against innocent parties. That the syndrome theory has been controversial in duress cases, and yet widely accepted in the self-defense context, despite its analytical and scientific flaws, suggests that the <b>battered</b> woman syndrome has been used in the self-defense context to help sympathetic actors. This paper recommends an alternative approach to understanding the conduct of <b>battered</b> women. The self-defense claims of justified <b>battered</b> women have failed not because <b>battered</b> women are qualitatively different than other actors, but because current self-defense rules are imperfect generally and do not encompass all necessary uses of defensive force. An alternative approach to these cases would treat <b>battered</b> women as rational actors and ask whether their use of defensive force was necessary. Unlike the prevailing approach to the <b>battered</b> woman cases, the recommended rational actor approach preserves the importance of objective standards when justifying defensive force. Moreover, an emphasis upon objective standards when applying criminal defenses reconciles the existing tension between the treatment of <b>battered</b> women in the duress and self-defense contexts. Viewed as rational actors and not psychologically impaired, <b>battered</b> women who defend themselves against their batterers have stronger normative claims that their conduct was necessary than <b>battered</b> women who appease their batterers by victimizing third parties...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{will focus}} on an {{important}} and controversial development in the law affecting <b>battered</b> women.
