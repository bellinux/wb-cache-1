40|$|Introduction. Reduced {{compound}} glutathione (GSH) in {{the lens}} has the function {{to protect the}} thiol group <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> proteins, and as a substrate of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione S-transferase (GST). Protein containing thiol groups is significant for the normal function <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> epithelium, i. e. enzymes Na-K-ATP-ase, thus influencing cell permeability. The relationship GSH/GSSG (oxidized glutathione) is normally high in the lens and other ocular tissue owing to the glutathioneredox cycle, which is localized in the lens epithelium and cortex surface. Objective. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate non-enzymic factors of the antioxidant protection of non-protein and protein tiol, as well as to determine glutathione-dependent enzyme activity in the corticonuclear <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>lenses</b> in patients with senile cataract. Methods. Biochemical studies <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> were carried on 101 patients with senile cataract. According to cataract maturity degree, the patients were classified into two groups: senile incipient cataract (N= 41) and mature senile cataract (N= 60). GSH concentration was determined by Ellman’s reagent. GPx activity was assayed with cumene hydroperoxide, and that of glutathione S-transferase by follow-up of glutathione conjugation and 1 -chloro- 2. 4 -dinitrobenzene rates. Results. A significantly higher GSH concentration was found in the corticonuclear <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>lenses</b> with initial as related to mature cataract (p< 0. 001). The activity of enzyme GPx and GST was considerably higher in the corticonuclear <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>lenses</b> with initial cataract (p< 0. 001). With cataract progression, the quantity of available GSH, necessary for GPx and GST functioning, declined, so that the activity of these enzymes was also significantly decreased in mature cataract. Conclusion. The determined lower GSH concentration and antioxidant enzyme activity in corticonuclear <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>lenses,</b> particularly in cataract with a nuclear component, indicate the weakened antioxidant response <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> tissue during the development of senile cataract...|$|R

40|$|Regulatory {{elements}} of the mouse γF-crystallin gene were used to derive transgenic mice expressing SV 40 large T antigen in terminally differentiating fiber cells <b>of</b> the ocular <b>lens.</b> The resulting γF-crystallin-T antigen mice developed either malignant or regressive lens tumors in a strain-dependent fashion. Developmental and RNA analyses revealed that in both 'tumor-progressing' and 'tumor-regressing' mouse strains expression <b>of</b> the transgene <b>blocked</b> morphological differentiation <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> fibers without appreciably affecting γ-crystallin gene expression, a marker <b>of</b> terminal <b>lens</b> fiber cell differentiation. Strain-dependent differences in tumorigenic outcome could be correlated with both subtle differences in transgene expression {{and the ability of}} tumor cells to escape from the normal confines <b>of</b> the <b>lens.</b> The results implicate the importance of cellular environment to malignant tumor development and provide insight into those features <b>of</b> normal <b>lens</b> ontogeny that may render the lens refractory to the development of spontaneous tumors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Any {{dielectric}} lens has a finite closed boundary and therefore is, in fact, an open dielectric resonator capable of supporting resonant modes whose Q-factor depends <b>of</b> the <b>lens</b> parameters (size, shape, and material). The hemielliptic lens, {{that is an}} essential building <b>block</b> <b>of</b> many mm-wave and THz antennas, is not an exception: it supports the so-called halfbowtie (HBT) resonances that can strongly affect performance of such antennas. In this paper we illustrate the interplay between the optical and modal features in the electromagnetic behaviour <b>of</b> hemielliptic <b>lenses</b> and highlight the drastic influence of the HBT resonances on radiation characteristics <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> antennas. We also discuss the difficulties associated with accurate description of the resonant phenomena in compact-size hemielliptic lenses with conventional techniques and provide recommendations on how to minimize the parasitic impact of HBT resonances on the antenna performance.

40|$|Posterior capsule opacifcation–PCO is {{the most}} common {{complication}} after cataract surgery. Proliferation and migration <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> epithelial cells that remain in the capsular bag following cataract surgery can lead to the development of PCO, which is the main cause of deterioration of visual function. PCO shows the classic features of fbrosis, including hyperproliferation, migration, deposition of matrix and its shrinkage and transdiﬀerentiation into myofbroblast. Astonishingly, the results of recent research show the importance <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> epithelium for lens regeneration following congenital cataract surgery. New minimally invasive cataract surgery removes only 1 – 1. 5 mm <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> epithelium more laterally, so the major part of the epithelium remains in the capsular bag. Conceptually, the new method diﬀers from the current practice, since it preserves the endogenous epithelial cells <b>of</b> the <b>lens</b> and achieves functional lens regeneration in rabbits and monkeys as well as in human infants with congenital cataracts. Pluripotency <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> epithelial cells and their stem cell nature are crucial for lens regeneration. Ex vivo cultures <b>of</b> the <b>lens</b> capsule explants can be used for testing the pharmacological agents for stimulating and inhibiting the growth <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> epithelial cells.

The incidence of the pigmented arc after 3, 6 and 12 months <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> wear was determined. Results: The incidence of corneal pigmented arc was 17 % (27 %), 49 % (49 %) and 90 % (93 %) after 3, 6 and 12 months lens wear respectively in {{the left and right}} eyes. For subjects with arcs observed in the left eye within the first 6 months <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> wear, the mean ± S. D. period <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> wear before initial detection of the arc was 14 ± 7. 4 weeks, and no correlation was found between this factor and the baseline spherical and cylindrical refractive errors (i. e. refractive sphere and cylinder, respectively), spherical equivalent refractive error (SERE), the target myopia reduction, the amount of refractive sphere (or SERE) reduction and changes in central and peripheral corneal curvatures after 6 months <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> wear. Baseline refractive sphere, baseline SERE, target, amount of myopia reduction, and change in central corneal curvature were significantly larger (p < 0. 05) in those subjects with pigmented arcs after about 6 months <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> wear. The intensity of the observed pigmented arcs after about 6 months <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> wear was significantly related to the time when it was first observed (p = 0. 003). Significant correlation was also found between the intensity of the arcs and the following parameters: baseline refractive sphere and SERE, target, change in central corneal curvature, and amount of myopia reduction (p < 0. 006). After about 12 months <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> wear, the intensity of observed arcs was significantly related to the baseline refractive sphere, SERE and the target (p < 0. 006).

Before the operation there has been determined relative echodensity <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> according to an original technique and assessed the lens colour and nuclear mass. Results. Brown colour <b>of</b> the <b>lens</b> nucleus is slightly increasing with years (r= 0. 4; р < 0. 05). Mean value <b>of</b> relative <b>lens</b> echodensity is 0. 59 ± 0. 01. An average mass <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> nucleus is 98. 3 ± 1. 0 mg, and its average density is 1312. 0 ± 12. 0 mg/m 2. Mature cataract is revealed to be not always hard (r= 0. 4; р < 0. 05), i. e. in this case the relation is inverse. When lens density increases, mechanical hardness of its nucleus grows up (r= 0. 4, р < 0. 05). At the same time mechanical density <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> nucleus increases with the increase of years (r= 0. 74, р < 0. 05).
