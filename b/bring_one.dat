5|$|Despite the {{previous}} season's heroics, Primus {{was not used}} regularly {{in the early part}} of Portsmouth's first Premier League season. Harry Redknapp had ditched his 3–5–2 formation in favour of the more conventional 4–4–2 and partnered new record signing Dejan Stefanović with Arjan de Zeeuw. During December, Portsmouth were in a terrible run of form and Redknapp decided to <b>bring</b> <b>one</b> of his most reliable players back into his plans for the derby match with Southampton. In spite of a 3–0 loss, Primus retained his starting place for the remainder of the season.|$|E
5|$|Ealdred (or Aldred; died 11 September 1069) was Abbot of Tavistock, Bishop of Worcester, and Archbishop of York in Anglo-Saxon England. He {{was related}} {{to a number of}} other ecclesiastics of the period. After {{becoming}} a monk at the monastery at Winchester, he was appointed Abbot of Tavistock Abbey in around 1027. In 1046 he was named to the Bishopric of Worcester. Ealdred, besides his episcopal duties, served Edward the Confessor, the King of England, as a diplomat and as a military leader. He worked to <b>bring</b> <b>one</b> of the king's relatives, Edward the Exile, back to England from Hungary to secure an heir for the childless king.|$|E

He joined the team, which competed in the NJCAA, as a co-captain under coach Dave Chevalier with hopes of returning to NCAA Division I in the future. Owumi brought CCRI to its first NJCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship appearance in four years by defeating Lackawanna College on March 13, 2005. However, the team did not <b>bring</b> <b>one</b> of its best defenders, and they were eventually beaten. Owumi earned second-team NJCAA All-American honors, becoming the sixth in school history to do so.|$|E

With Tandy driving for Porsche, KCMG employed Toyota's test and reserve driver Nicolas Lapierre {{to fill his}} position for the Spa-Francorchamps race and the 24 Hours of Le Mans. GP2 Series driver Mitch Evans made his first appearance in sports car racing alongside European Le Mans Series competitor Simon Dolan, and Nissan factory driver Harry Tincknell for Jota Sport. Despite a failed buyout of the team by Kairos, a data encryption company, Team SARD Morand confirmed {{their commitment to the}} World Endurance Championship and opted to <b>bring</b> <b>one</b> car which was driven by Oliver Webb, Pierre Ragues and Zoël Amberg. Johannes van Overbeek returned to co-drive for Extreme Speed Motorsports after missing the season's opening round because of a rib injury.|$|E
5|$|The {{themes of}} Reflections are {{connected}} to Coleridge's The Eolian Harp as the scene for both is the same. The land of Clevedon is praised and seen full of life, and it serves as contrast to escaping {{from the real world}} into fantasy and pondering about the abstract. Both poems also describe Coleridge's relationship with his wife and feelings of sexual desire. The imagination aspects of the poem represent an unwillingness to accept nature on its own and rejects the conclusion of The Eolian Harp. Although the land of Clevedon can <b>bring</b> <b>one</b> closer to God, one cannot just simply exist in such an area but must seek out truth.|$|E

Fearing Andy will choose Buzz, Woody {{attempts}} to trap Buzz behind a desk, but ends up accidentally knocking him out a window, and the other toys rebel against Woody by accusing him of knocking Buzz out of jealousy. Before they can exact revenge, Andy takes Woody instead and leaves for Pizza Planet. When the family stops for gas, Woody finds that Buzz has hitched {{a ride on the}} car as well, and fight, only to find the family has left without them. They manage to {{make their way to the}} restaurant by stowing away on a pizza delivery truck, where Buzz, still thinking he is a real space ranger, despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a crane game, where they are salvaged by Andy's mischievous neighbor, Sid Phillips.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Dawson {{had decided}} that the two French troops should take the lead into Ouistreham, {{followed}} by the six British troops. The French were unopposed apart from some mortar rounds and machine gun fire as they neared their objective. No. 8 French Troop occupied houses at the front and sides of the Casino strong point. An assault to capture the Casino was driven back. While {{this was going on}} the other French troop, No. 1, approached the Casino from the rear. Taking up firing positions they too started to engage the strong point but their fire had almost no effect. The French commander Capitaine de frégate Philippe Kieffer was just about to order an all out assault by both troops, when reports that British amphibious tanks were in Ouistreham reached him. Sending a guide to <b>bring</b> <b>one</b> forward, the tank arrived in front of the Casino and proceeded to destroy the German gun emplacements. Within 30 minutes of the tanks' arrival, all the strong point guns were silenced and No. 1Troop had assaulted and captured the objective. With its capture the French Commandos were now in control of the western suburbs of Ouistreham.|$|E
5|$|The {{themes of}} Reflections {{are similar to}} those of The Eolian Harp. They are set in the same location, and both {{describe}} Coleridge's relationship with his wife and sexual desire. The reflection on his life within the poem represent an unwillingness to accept his current idyllic life and a rejection of the conclusion drawn in The Eolian Harp. Although the land of Clevedon can <b>bring</b> <b>one</b> closer to God in Coleridge's view, he reflects on how one cannot simply exist in such an area but must actively seek out truth in order to fulfill God's will. The poem details how men feel a need to seek truth like a philosopher while also desiring to simply live in an idyllic natural state. The poem reconciles these desires by claiming that the pursuer of truth can still reflect back on his time when he was simply enjoying nature and God's presence.|$|E

5|$|The German {{artillery}} bombardment was heaviest in {{the sector}} {{held by the}} right company of the 47th Battalion and the 2nd Tyneside Pioneers {{on either side of}} the railway bridge northwest of Dernancourt. I/230 RIR had barely been able to reach its jumping off point in time, and fell behind its barrage. It advanced through the British barrage south of Dernancourt and quickly moved through the village, with part of the battalion reaching the railway embankment. About 09:30, the German shelling in the sector near the bridge lessened. The commander of the right section of the 12th Machine Gun Company, stationed near the bridge with the 2nd Tyneside Pioneers, climbed up the embankment and looking over the rails, saw a number of German bayonets sticking up on the other side. After a quick discussion with the ranking officer of the pioneers in that area, it was decided they would attack immediately. Charging across the railway line, they pushed the German force back far enough to <b>bring</b> <b>one</b> of the Vickers guns into action. The fire from this gun drove the Germans of I/230 RIR back as far as Dernancourt. Before this counter-attack was launched, Foord, feeling his position to be insecure, requested reinforcement. Two companies of Highland Light Infantry were sent forward from the 106th Brigade support line, arriving around the time of the counter-attack, although they suffered significant casualties as they moved down the exposed slope. II and III/230 RIR were unable to get through Dernancourt to reinforce I/230 RIR, due to a tremendous British bombardment that fell on the village as they approached. They sought shelter in the cellars of the village. Any troops that attempted to cross the open ground between the village and the railway were shot down.|$|E

25|$|Dezong {{began his}} reign by issuing {{a variety of}} edicts restricting {{wasteful}} government spending. Monetary contribution from local government officials or abroad were discouraged or limited. He also issued edicts that freed hundreds of palace girls {{in order to reduce}} palace expenses. These acts were all met with praise however they only lasted {{the first few years of}} his reign. A series of unfortunate events which included revolts by military governors forced Dezong to flee Chang'an in 784. During the months in exile, Dezong began to realize the importance of creating wealth and as a result, after Dezong's returned to Chang'an he began to reversed many of the original edicts he set forth. With the aid of eunuchs, Dezong started to amalgamate a large fortune either by extortion or bribery. These in turn led to a negative atmosphere where wealth rather than merit would ultimately <b>bring</b> <b>one</b> power.|$|E
25|$|Association {{football}} (soccer) team Melbourne Victory FC occasionally {{plays at}} Kardinia Park. After a seven-year gap between their first match, a 2007 A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup match against Newcastle Jets and their second, a 2014 AFC Champions League qualifying play-off against Thai side Muangthong United, the ground hosted its first ever A-League premiership match in 2015 when Victory played Perth Glory FC in Round 14 of the 2014-15 A-League season with an attendance of 21,289 {{as the first}} match of a three-year deal to <b>bring</b> <b>one</b> Victory fixture per season to Geelong. The second match drew 14,268 fans to an exciting six goal come-from-behind draw by the Victory against Central Coast Mariners in January 2016, while the third was held on 2 January 2017 with Newcastle Jets as the visiting team, when a crowd of 14,081 witnessed Besart Berisha overtake Archie Thompson's all-time A-League scoring record in a 4–2 win for the Victory.

25|$|In his {{capacity}} as Assistant Curator at the American Museum of Natural History, Franz Boas requested that Arctic explorer Robert E. Peary <b>bring</b> <b>one</b> Inuk from Greenland to New York. Peary obliged and brought six Inuit to New York in 1897 {{who lived in}} the basement of the American Museum of Natural History. Four of them died from tuberculosis within a year of arriving in New York, with the exception of one young boy, Minik Wallace. Boas staged a funeral for the father of the boy, and instead of resting the remains in peace, Boas had the remains dissected and placed in the museum. Later Minik Wallace realized that his father's bones were kept at the museum and requested their return. Boas then no longer worked at the museum, but the museum did not want to return the bones. Minik eventually was able to return to Greenland, but Boas did not help him or pay any attention to the plight of the Inuit whom he had brought to New York. Boas has been widely critiqued for his role in bringing Minik and the five other Inuit to New York, and his disinterest in them once they had served their purpose at the museum.|$|E
