On 15 December she detached {{to investigate a}} distress message from Nevada in position 56° 35' N x 49° 10' W to which position Comanche proceeded at full speed.

5000|$|In former Trim-Tab servo systems, {{the pivot}} {{movement}} of the servo blade around its vertical axis {{has been carried out}} by a trim tab Servo tab, which however costs some force due to the fact, that the trim tab is moved in the opposite direction to turn the servo blade.The same holds for a trim trim tab, which is mounted at a big distance behind the ship's rudder, connected to it at its upper and lower end. This construction is called [...] "The Saye's Rigg". Another version of wind vane self steering on sail boats is known as the vertical axis vane and usually, because of the inferior steering force output compared to Servo Pendulum devices it makes use of a trim tab hung off the rudder to control the course of the boat. The vane spins at right angles to the ground and can lock to the trim tab in any desired position, as the <b>boat</b> <b>falls</b> off the wind the vane will be turned by the wind and will take the trim tab with it which in turn causes the rudder to move in the opposite direction and thus corrects course. Generally self steering like this, with a trim tab can only be used on boats with transom (or aft hung double enders) rudders as the trim tab needs to be mounted directly to and aft of the rudder to produce the desired effect, and of course has to be controlled even as the rudder swings side to side. This is typically accomplished by use of a slotted bar in which the connection to the vane assembly can slide in as the rudder turns. These self steering systems are generally simpler and are thus easier to set and adjust course as they don't make use of lines controlling the rudder but control it more directly through solid linkages.A related device has been used on some windmills, the fantail, a small windmill mounted at right angles to the main sails which automatically turns the heavy cap and main sails into the wind, (invented in England in 1745). (When the wind is already directly into the main vanes, the fantail remains essentially motionless.) ...|$|E
40|$|Falls are a {{frequent}} cause of unintentional injuries. The {{development of a}} water sports fall detection algorithm usually requires a dataset collection of fall events {{that are difficult to}} replicate in a laboratory environment. To address that problem, this article proposes a simulated <b>boat</b> <b>falls</b> protocol {{that can be used to}} record a dataset of falls for various water sports. A dataset of 296 samples comprised in 129 falls and in 167 non-fall events was gathered using the protocol. The data collection was made with 3 different smartphones and with 1 external IMU. A fall detection algorithm was trained with the dataset with machine learning techniques and tested over the same dataset and real sailing data. The algorithm achieved 99. 9 % of accuracy, 99 % of specificity and 100 % of sensitivity when tested in the dataset and detected the only fall that occurred in one hour and a half of a real sailing activitiy...|$|E

5000|$|Ships are {{generally}} larger than boats, {{but there is}} no universally accepted distinction between the two. Ships generally can remain at sea {{for longer periods of time}} than boats. A legal definition of ship from Indian case law is a vessel that carries goods by sea. A common notion is that a ship can carry a boat, but not vice versa. A US Navy rule of thumb is that ships heel towards the outside of a sharp turn, whereas boats heel towards the inside because of the relative location of the center of mass versus the center of buoyancy. American and British 19th Century maritime law distinguished [...] "vessels" [...] from other craft; ships and <b>boats</b> <b>fall</b> in one legal category, whereas open boats and rafts are not considered vessels.|$|R
