30|$|The {{interviews}} with the planners at the SRA show how they tackled {{the question of who}} are representative road users and what they might want. By collecting and systematizing requests, they try to differentiate between general “needs” and the “subjective” wishes of an individual. To this end, the planners have explicit methods such as CSI and the customer case management system Kundskap, intended to ensure objectivity. Yet the planners find it difficult to use explicit methods to pin down <b>good</b> <b>representativity.</b> They look for the representative user but cannot find him or her.|$|R
40|$|Industrial {{furnaces}} {{constitute a}} complex, nonlinear, distributed-parameter thermal system. The usual way to model {{them is to}} write the equations describing the physical phenomena. The analytic model thus obtained is often too complex to be useful for control and optimization purposes. We propose to build a linear model by running the analytic model to obtain the simulated data, then apply the least square approximation to those data to obtain the linearizing coefficients. This statistical approach is simple to implement and yields linear models with <b>good</b> <b>representativity.</b> The annoying aspect {{is that some of}} the coefficients thus obtained may not lend themselves to a direct interpretation of the physical process. But with proper consideration, this is no obstacle to the use of the model...|$|R

The theoretical approach has permit to respect 7 criteria out of 9 recommended {{at the time of}} the choice and the installation of an automatic sampler. The experimental tests showed a satisfactory homogeneity of concentrations in the various sections of measurement, a <b>good</b> <b>representativity</b> of samplings when the pipes are clean a contamination of samples by clogging of samplings pipes because of erosion of biofilms, an influence of temperature and shelf life on the samples intended for the analysis of ammonium and dissolved parameters. The contamination will be eliminated by samplings wastewater then clean water before each measurement campaign and by setting out of the water of samplings pipes. All the analyses will be carried out immediately...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{following}} {{study is}} motivated {{by the need to}} capture the elasto-viscoplastic behavior of a “real” industrial power module lead-free solder joint. In this work, we carried out a numerical design of experiments in order to forecast the ability of an experimental bending system to identify the specimen material properties. As a proof of principle, the micro-mechanical elastic behavior of power module copper substrates was then characterized thanks to the development of an innovative in-situ micro-mechanical bending test under an optical profilometer. An inverse Finite-Element Method has been applied in order to identify the material properties of test specimens designed directly out of industrial assemblies and not from bulk solder for <b>good</b> <b>representativity.</b> The results show that identified copper Young's modulus values are lower than that of a bulk material. It will be defined as such in the next identificatio n step targeting the solder joint...|$|R
40|$|An intercomparison of {{radar and}} {{satellite}} rainfall estimates with a raingauge network was performed for the Curitiba Metropolitan Area of (CMA) {{in the summer}} of 2003 / 2004. This period was associated with convective and stratiform meteorological systems which presented <b>good</b> <b>representativity</b> of various real atmospheric states. An example of quantitative precipitation estimation is presented in this paper, for the purpose of flood events estimation with a hydrological model in the CMA. The results indicate that, although satellite precipitation estimation presents good results in low to medium precipitation cases, and radar estimates results indicated improvements when the field was obtained using an advection technique, the integration of radar, satellite and raingauges present better results and should be investigated more. The integration of radar and satellite precipitation will also improve the precipitation field for use in the hydrological and meteorological models mainly in flashflood events and in regions where a dense network of raingauges are not available.

To evaluate actual environmental situation, its necessary to update and to detail disponible natural resources maps, mainly soils. Then, the objective {{for this work}} was to study the correlations within soils, geomorphology, geology and native vegetation and to detail disponible soil map of DF and to elaborate an pilot soil map of an representative area of DF, with scale 1 : 25. 000. From literature studies and field studies, a model of geo-geomorphopedologic from the region was made, which allowed the generation of pilot soil classes map from DF, with scale 1 : 25. 000, through geoprocessamento activities, using ArcView 3. 2. The native vegetation was individualized in orbital images through the software ENVI 3. 5 and was correlated with the pilot soil map generated. The correlation soils x native vegetation showed a <b>good</b> <b>representativity</b> at the proposed scale, {{which can be used}} for several studies of environmental sustentability.

40|$|Tests to {{evaluate}} competition between plants, in general {{do not consider}} the soil spatial variability, nevertheless, the uniformity rarely is present {{and can not be}} assumed without verification. The aim of this work was to apply geostatistics to verify the spatial variability of the soil in an experimental field near Ribeirão Preto, SP, with sugarcane variety IACSP 93 - 3046. Ninety seven geo-referenced samples, placed at distances of 10 m, were collected for soil chemical analysis, soil resistance to penetration and biometric evaluation of the sugar cane plant included number of tillers, stalk diameter, stalk height, estimated productivity (TSSe) and root density. Geostatistics has been applied by means of semivariogram, data interpolation via kriging and iso-line maps creation. The results have shown soil spatial dependence for most of the evaluated attributes. The spots, within the area, with low resistance to penetration and low soil density have shown the largest number of tillers and the largest root development of sugar cane. For soil chemical attributes, there was spatial dependence showing higher concentration of nutrients in the central area. The sampling allowed a <b>good</b> <b>representativity</b> of the spatial dependence of soil and plants, making it possible to eliminate the randomness hypothesis for the placement of the plots in this area. 201...|$|R
