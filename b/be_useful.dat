5|$|A surface weather {{analysis}} {{is a type}} of weather map that depicts positions for high and low-pressure areas, as well as various types of synoptic scale systems such as frontal zones. Isotherms can be drawn on these maps, which are lines of equal temperature. Isotherms are drawn normally as solid lines at a preferred temperature interval. They show temperature gradients, which can <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> in finding fronts, which are on the warm side of large temperature gradients. By plotting the freezing line, isotherms can <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> in determination of precipitation type. Mesoscale boundaries such as tropical cyclones, outflow boundaries and squall lines also are analyzed on surface weather analyses.|$|E

5|$|Behavioral therapy may <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> {{for chronic}} pain. There are several types available, {{including}} operant conditioning, which uses reinforcement to reduce undesirable behaviors and increase desirable behaviors; cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps people identify and correct negative thinking and behavior; and respondent conditioning, which can modify an individual's physiological response to pain. Medical providers may develop an integrated program of behavioral therapies. The evidence is inconclusive {{as to whether}} mindfulness-based stress reduction reduces chronic back pain intensity or associated disability, although it suggests that it may <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> in improving the acceptance of existing pain.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin may <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> in {{skin and}} soft tissue infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); many strains of MRSA are still {{susceptible}} to clindamycin; however, in the United States spreading from the West Coast eastwards, MRSA {{is becoming increasingly}} resistant.|$|E
5|$|For {{older people}} with chronic pain, opioids {{may be used}} in those for whom NSAIDs present too great a risk, {{including}} those with diabetes, stomach or heart problems. They may also <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> for a select group of people with neuropathic pain.|$|E

40|$|Purpose and methods: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} reformation of pre-graduate medical education on the students of years 2005 - 2007, we analyzed a questionnaire targeting those students after graduation. Results: General education has a low degree of usefulness for the students. Basic medical education <b>was</b> <b>useful</b> as a preparation for clinical medicine. Clinical education <b>was</b> <b>useful</b> in terms of knowledge and skill, but {{not in terms of}} attitude. Both general education and clinical education <b>were</b> somewhat <b>useful</b> for the older graduates. Among the new educational methods, only OSCE <b>was</b> <b>useful.</b> Conclusion: Reformation of pre-graduate medical education <b>was</b> <b>useful</b> especially in regard to clinical skill education...|$|R

The rods <b>are</b> <b>useful</b> for lathe turning, among other things, and the tubes <b>are</b> <b>useful</b> for making rings in jewelry work. The tubes are available in various sizes, and also with a flat top, which <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> for signet rings.|$|R

5|$|A {{high blood}} {{prolactin}} level {{within the first}} 20 minutes following a seizure may <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> to help confirm an epileptic seizure as opposed to psychogenic non-epileptic seizure. Serum prolactin level is less useful for detecting focal seizures. If it is normal an epileptic seizure is still possible and a serum prolactin does not separate epileptic seizures from syncope.

Often, this determination can only be made at the time of surgery.|$|E
