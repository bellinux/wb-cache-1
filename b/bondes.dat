5000|$|In 1860, she {{appointed}} överhovmästarinna (Mistress of the Robes) to queen Louise {{in succession}} to countess Stefanie Hamilton, the highest rank for a female at the royal Swedish court. This position made her the head of all the female courtiers {{in the court of}} the queen with the rank of Excellency, outranking also the majority of males and given superior status with responsibility of all the ladies-in-waiting of the queens court. She accepted the position out of personal friendship with Louise and the condition that she would be allowed to delegate her tasks to one of the ladies-in-waiting when her private life demanded to, and she normally left the daily affairs to others. Bonde had a good relationship with queen Louise, who counted upon her to rectify those ladies-in-waiting which aroused the queen's jealousy by attracting attention from the king. On one occasion, the queen wrote to her: [...] "..thank you for reprimanding the ladies, it helped. Some are afraid of you, and that is very fortunate, I hope it will continue like that. I do not have to tell you of whom I am referring to". Mina Bonde upheld a strict discipline at court, was an expert on etiquette and could reprimand not only courtiers but also members of the royal house in matters of etiquette. Bonde left her position at court on her own request in 1869. When she requested to be relieved of her position, Fritz von Dardel commented in his chronicle: [...] "Their Majesties are not likely to mourn over her departure, as they have never approved of her out dated ideas in everything related to etiquette".Her departure was regretted by the conservative fraction at court and welcomed by the reformist fraction: three years after her departure, in 1872, women who were not members of the nobility (if married to a man with a court office or high military rank) were for the first time allowed to be presented at court, and after the accession of Oscar II to the throne in 1873, the royal court was reduced.

Negando essa territoriliza????o, mas sem perder o sentido de perten??a, esses jovens agregam-se em torno de s??mbolos de poder, masculinidade e viol??ncia, para semantizar seu grupo, e saem em circula????o pelos espa??os movimentados da capital onde possam fazer-se vis??veis.

A partir da defini????o dessa situa????o, os jovens se organizam em grandes grupos que levam, no nome ou nos cantos que entoam, a defesa simb??lica da comunidade em que vivem.

This dissertation is {{the result}} of a research on so-called <b>bondes</b> in Porto Alegre. The sociability style of these trams is analogous to Cariocas galleys locals, young people who get together to hang out and enjoy the leisure spaces. The configuration of these groups occurs at the junction of individuals, residents of the city???s outskirts, which suffer a process of segregation and stigmatization that tends to confine them in their places of residence. Denying this territorialisation, but without losing the sense belonging, they add up around symbols of power, masculinity and violence to semanticizing your group, and go into circulation by the capital???s crowded spaces where they can make themselves visible. The association of these young people not only gives the vicinal closeness sense and belonging to the outskirts, but also in response to a situation of conflict felt within the group by how are perceived negatively in their forays to the center. From the definition of the situation, young people are organized in large groups that lead, in name or corners to chant in symbolic defense of the community in which they live. They use the conflict and stigmatization suffered by the others residents of the city to establish a shared social experience, founding it their subjectivity.

From the 1530 s onwards, in fact, Till Eulenspiegel became the protagonist of a series of texts in Dutch, French, English, Polish, Yiddish and Latin. Eventually, at the end of the 16 th century, he arrived in Scandinavia, where a Danish and a Swedish version have come down to us. A Danish version of the Eulenspiegel, which is now lost, might have existed in 1571 when the translator of Georg Wickram's Vngi Karlis og Drengis Speiel mentions, in his preface, a not better specified "Ugelspegels Historie". Even though in the Catalogus librorum qvi reperiuntur in Bibliotheca Laurentii Alberti, civis ac bibliopolæ ciuitatis jmperialis Lubicensis of 1591 a text called Til Vlenspiegel is included as a "Danish book", the first preserved copy of a Danish Tiile Ugelspegel appeared about 100 years later (ca. 1690, Underlig og selsom Historie, om Tiile Ugelspegel, en <b>Bondes</b> Søn, barnfød udi det Land Brunzvig, Saare kortvilig at læse.
