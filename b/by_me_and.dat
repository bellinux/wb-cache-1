And, when it was announced that Mr. Andrew Halliday had dramatized Ainsworth's 'Miser's Daughter,' I went to see the performance; and when I saw represented on the stage scenes and characters which had emanated from me, I then publicly claimed to be the originator of that romance, and to have suggested the original idea and characters to Mr. Ainsworth.|$|E

500|$|She was {{the first}} child of Queen Victoria to die, with her mother outliving her by more than 20 years. Victoria noted the {{coincidence}} of the dates of Albert's and Alice's deaths as [...] "almost incredible and most mysterious". Writing in her journal {{on the day of}} Alice's death, Queen Victoria referred to the recent sufferings of the family: [...] "This terrible day come round again!" [...] Shocked by grief, she wrote to her daughter Princess Victoria: [...] "My precious child, who stood <b>by</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> upheld me seventeen years ago on the same day taken, and by such an awful and fearful disease...She had darling Papa's nature, and much of his self-sacrificing character and fearless and entire devotion to duty!" [...] The animosity that Victoria had towards Alice seemed no longer present. Princess Victoria expressed her grief to her mother in a 39-page letter, and deeply mourned Alice, the sister to whom she was closest. However, both {{she and her husband were}} forbidden from attending the funeral by the Emperor of Germany, who was worried about their safety.|$|E

He then handed the band a fragile 78rpm 10-inch acetate record. It was later lost until Lowe rediscovered it in 1981, and planned to put it up for auction at Sotheby's, but sold it to McCartney for an undisclosed amount. McCartney later had the two songs digitally re-mastered and pressed 50 copies, giving them to friends as a Christmas present, although the two songs were released on 21 November 1995, as part of The Beatles Anthology (Anthology 1). McCartney later said, [...] "The strangest thing for me, listening to it, is that it's like drowning, it's like your life flashing by in front of you.

500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{recalled}} that [...] "Balakirev had no difficulty in {{getting along with}} me. At his suggestion I most readily rewrote the symphonic movements composed <b>by</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> brought them to completion {{with the help of}} his advice and improvisations". Though Rimsky-Korsakov later found Balakirev's influence stifling, and broke free from it, this did not stop him in his memoirs from extolling the older composer's talents as a critic and improviser. Under Balakirev's mentoring, Rimsky-Korsakov turned to other compositions. He began a symphony in B minor, but felt it too closely followed Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and abandoned it. He completed an Overture on Three Russian Themes, based on Balakirev's folksong overtures, as well as a Fantasia on Serbian Themes that was performed at a concert given for the delegates of the Slavonic Congress in 1867. In his review of this concert, nationalist critic Vladimir Stasov coined the phrase Moguchaya kuchka for the Balakirev circle (Moguchaya kuchka is usually translated as [...] "The Mighty Handful" [...] or [...] "The Five"). Rimsky-Korsakov also composed the initial versions of Sadko and Antar, which cemented his reputation as a writer of orchestral works.|$|E
500|$|Whitman had intense {{friendships with}} many {{men and boys}} {{throughout}} his life. Some biographers have suggested {{that he may not}} have actually engaged in sexual relationships with males, while others cite letters, journal entries, and other sources that they claim as proof of the sexual nature of some of his relationships. English poet and critic John Addington Symonds spent 20 years in correspondence trying to pry the answer from him. In 1890 he wrote to Whitman, [...] "In your conception of Comradeship, do you contemplate the possible intrusion of those semi-sexual emotions and actions which no doubt do occur between men?" [...] In reply, Whitman denied that his work had any such implication, asserting [...] "hat the calamus part has even allow'd the possibility of such construction as mention'd is terrible—I am fain to hope the pages themselves are not to be even mention'd for such gratuitous and quite at this time entirely undream'd & unreck'd possibility of morbid inferences—wh' are disavow'd <b>by</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> seem damnable," [...] and insisting that he had fathered six illegitimate children.

2500|$|Around {{the time}} that Tiberius died, Agrippina had become pregnant. Domitius had {{acknowledged}} the paternity of the child. In {{the early morning hours}} in Antium of December 15, 37, Agrippina gave birth to a son. Agrippina and Domitius named their son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, after the Domitius' recently deceased father. This child would grow up to become the Emperor Nero. Nero was Agrippina's only natural child. Suetonius states that Domitius was congratulated by friends on the birth of his son, whereupon he replied [...] "I don't think anything produced <b>by</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> Agrippina could possibly be good for the state or the people".|$|E

Suppose, for example, that I have a mental image of a triangle.

Remember that Ramsay's health was breaking up in the last two years. He had lost his nerve in the House in the last year. I had to take all the important speeches. The moment he went, I prepared for a general election and got a bigger majority for rearmament. No power on earth could have got rearmament without a general election except by a big split. Simon was inefficient. I had to lead the House, keep the machine together with those Labour fellows.|$|E
2500|$|III. The Buddha and the Upaniṣads (pp. 26-35). [...] "Gautama the Buddha," [...] Radhakrishnan argues, [...] "has {{suffered}} {{as much as}} anyone from critics without a sense of history. He has been cried up, and cried down, with an equal lack of historical imagination." [...] He explains that [...] "To know what the Buddha actually taught or what his earliest followers thought he did, we must place ourselves in imagination in the India of the sixth century B.C.... Great minds make individual contributions of permanent value to the thought of their age; but they do not, and cannot, altogether transcend the age in which they live.... Even when they are propounding answers which are startlingly new, they use the inadequate ideas and concepts of tradition to express the deeper truths towards which they are feeling their way." [...] He quotes the Buddha as stating that [...] "'there are... four truths of the Brāhmins which have been realized <b>by</b> <b>me...</b> <b>and</b> made known" [...] stating that the Buddha's teaching [...] "is derived" [...] from the Upaniṣads.|$|E

He had seen this as a child, although Nimoy's father had told him not to look as they performed the blessing. This became the basis for the Vulcan salute. Solow later said that Nimoy was the key contributor to the character's depiction, saying that the [...] "Mr Spock character was 20% created by Gene Roddenberry, 20% created <b>by</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> 60% created by Leonard Nimoy". Nimoy recalled, [...] "As a Jew from Catholic Boston, I understood {{what it was like to}} feel alienated, apart from the mainstream... there were a number of values in Star Trek that I felt very comfortable with as a Jew". The character influenced Nimoy as well; years after the show he wrote that [...] "To this day, I sense Vulcan speech patterns, Vulcan social attitudes and even Vulcan patterns of logic and emotional suppression in my behavior." ...|$|E
