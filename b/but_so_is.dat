5|$|After Ueshiba left Hokkaidō in 1919, he met and {{was profoundly}} {{influenced}} by Onisaburo Deguchi, the {{spiritual leader of}} the Ōmoto-kyō religion (a neo-Shinto movement) in Ayabe. One of the primary features of Ōmoto-kyō is its emphasis on the attainment of utopia during one's life. This was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to {{those who seek to}} harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>is</b> the attacker.|$|E
5|$|Not only is {{the park}} historic, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>is</b> the mostly {{residential}} surrounding neighborhood. Many architectural works line the streets facing the park, designed {{by some of the}} most famous architects of the late 19th century, including Henry Hobson Richardson. At least two governors of New York lived in buildings facing Washington Park outside of their term in office. Due to the historical and architectural significance of the park and neighborhood both were included in 1972 as the Washington Park Historic District; and in 1998 the park was named one of the nation's 100 most important parks by the American Association of Architects. In 2008 Boston-based composer Peter Child wrote an orchestral piece inspired by the park, entitled Washington Park.|$|E

As for perennially put-upon Ben, what with a new arrival causing chaos in the surgery, being forced to take tango lessons and being officially {{declared}} dead, life is just one long major-league cirsis.|$|E

25|$|Heisenberg gave, as an illustration, the {{measurement}} of the position and momentum of an electron using a photon of light. In measuring the electron's position, the higher {{the frequency of the}} photon, the more accurate is {{the measurement}} of the position {{of the impact of the}} photon with the electron, but the greater is the disturbance of the electron. This is because from the impact with the photon, the electron absorbs a random amount of energy, rendering the measurement obtained of its momentum increasingly uncertain (momentum is velocity multiplied by mass), for one is necessarily measuring its post-impact disturbed momentum from the collision products and not its original momentum. With a photon of lower frequency, the disturbance (and hence uncertainty) in the momentum is less, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>is</b> the accuracy of {{the measurement of}} the position of the impact.|$|E
500|$|Tam {{considered}} McGowan's criticism to be {{over the}} top, and stated of James Smith's criticism, [...] "The salient point here is one about courage. We easily recognise physical courage such as saving orphans from burning buildings, or ordinary people putting {{their lives in the}} line of fire. It is far harder to recognise mental courage." [...] She added: [...] "Without a doubt, the police officer who died in the September 11 attacks was courageous. <b>But</b> <b>so</b> <b>is</b> Jenner.

Do I think games such as these could have dire psychological consequences, particularly for young people? As always, I remain agnostic on the matter. Who knows, really? The debate will never be resolved. The American military obviously thinks there's something there: The troubling new TV ad campaign for the U.S. reserves lures potential young soldiers with tales of adventure accompanied by blatant, video-game-styled animation. And, curiously, no one has complained about or tried to ban , in which stealth and killing figure even more heavily than in Manhunt.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) {{received}} {{rave reviews}} from most music critics. In {{an article for}} The Source, The Ghetto Communicator wrote [...] "This record is harsh, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>is</b> {{the world that we}} live in. For B-boys n'girls who come from the core of the hard, this is the hip-hop album you've been waiting for". Rolling Stones review was decidedly ambivalent, praising the album's sound, but noting that [...] "Wu-Tang... are more ciphers than masterful creations. In refusing to commodify themselves, they leave blank the ultimate canvas—the self." [...] Entertainment Weekly was more enthusiastic, giving the album an A, and writing that [...] "With its rumble jumble of drumbeats, peppered with occasional piano plunking, Enter has a raw, pass-the-mike flavor we haven't heard since rap was pop's best-kept secret." [...] Touré declared of the album, that [...] "This is hip-hop you won't find creeping up the Billboard charts but you will hear booming out of Jeep stereos in all the right neighborhoods." [...] However, Enter the Wu-Tang had surprising chart success, despite its raw, underground sound. It peaked at number 41 on the Billboard 200 chart and reached number eight on Billboards Top R/Hip Hop Albums chart. The album continued to sell steadily and was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on May 15, 1995.|$|E
500|$|Musically, {{the songs}} on Sucker Punch are {{highlighted}} with orchestrations and a rock edge. De Vries said that during the songs' production [...] "there was {{a substantial amount of}} reinvention, in several different directions", helped by Snyder giving the composers free reins. Bates added that there was an attempt to [...] "expand the scope of the songs in a way they were never heard before", with [...] "crazy electronic" [...] and [...] "alternative guitar work" [...] - [...] "it's a bit over the top, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>is</b> everything on screen." [...] The versions of the songs tried to match the action on-screen: Bates detailed that [...] "White Rabbit" [...] "starts out very ethereal, getting [...] into the mindset of the dance, and once the girls have their assignment, once they delve in with machineguns and other weapons, the song starts to bloom into this epic, rich, full orchestral choral fanfare." [...] This correspondence lead to the tracks getting longer and alternating between the songs themselves and [...] "a score that is reminiscent of songs sometimes", which Bates described as [...] "playing in the consciousness of the characters [...]" [...] For instance, [...] "White Rabbit" [...] features a choir of 150 voices playing the vocal melody of the first verse of the song, and tracks such as [...] "Search & Destroy" [...] have [...] "moments where Zach really wanted to blow it up into [...] huge orchestra".|$|E
500|$|Justice Scalia {{also criticized}} the majority's {{conclusion}} that the tip provided reasonable suspicion that Lorenzo and Jose Prado Navarette were driving while drunk, because [...] "the truck might have swerved to avoid an animal, a pothole, or a jaywalking pedestrian .... Or, indeed, he might have intentionally forced the tipster off the road because of some personal animus, or hostility to her 'Make Love, Not War' bumper sticker." [...] Furthermore, Justice Scalia argued that one discrete instance of irregular driving does not give rise to the reasonable suspicion of an ongoing threat of an intoxicated driver on the road. Justice Scalia also argued that the anonymous tip's claims of reckless driving were ultimately discredited {{by the fact that}} officers followed Lorenzo and Jose for five minutes, but observed nothing suspicious. He wrote, [...] "I take it as a fundamental premise of our intoxicated-driving laws that a driver soused enough to swerve once can be expected to swerve again — and soon. If he does not, and if the only evidence of his first episode of irregular driving is a mere inference from an uncorroborated, vague, and nameless tip, then the Fourth Amendment requires that he be left alone." [...] In his concluding remarks, Justice Scalia wrote [...] "runken driving is a serious matter, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>is</b> the loss of our freedom to come and go as we please without police interference .... After today’s opinion all of us on the road, and not just drug dealers, are at risk of having our freedom of movement curtailed on suspicion of drunkenness, based upon a phone tip, true or false, of a single instance of careless driving." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{recent decades}} Sydney has also {{undergone}} a major social liberalisation, with huge entertainment and gambling industries. Though {{there has been}} a decline in the dominance of Christianity through increased secularisation and the growing presence of an increasingly diverse migrant population, Sydney's two outspoken Archbishops, George Pell (Catholic) and Peter Jensen (Anglican) remain vocal in national debates and the hosting of Catholic World Youth Day 2008, led by Pope Benedict XVI, drew huge crowds of worshipers to the city. An evangelical Christian [...] "bible belt" [...] has developed in the north-western suburbs. Buddhist and Muslim communities in particular are growing, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>is</b> irreligiosity. While a grant from the State government permitted the final completion of the spires of St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney in 2000 (the foundation stone was laid in 1868), construction of the present structure of the large Auburn Gallipoli Mosque began in 1986 and at Wollongong, south of Sydney, Nan Tien Temple opened in 1995 as one of the southern hemisphere's largest Buddhist temples. Sydney has gained a reputation for secularism and hedonism, with the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras becoming a world-famous event.

2500|$|As {{early as}} 1982 when the Compact Disc was being introduced, Blyth {{researched}} {{the possibilities of}} creating a digital mixing console. He told Billboard magazine that Soundcraft would not be [...] "leaping into digital {{in the way that}} Neve has done. I think they have gone too far, too quickly.... We are looking at the digital control of analog functions as the first step in that direction." [...] Picking up the pace in the 2000s, Blyth, together with Product Manager Andy Brown, created the Soundcraft Vi6, a digital mixer intended for sound reinforcement applications, released mid-2006. Its interface was a development of Vistonics, a broadcast and studio mixing concept from Harman-owned Studer combined with a digital effects package from Lexicon. Regarding digital audio equipment, Blyth is of the opinion that [...] "companies that take great care over their analog stages, use the best internal digital format and write the best DSP code end up with the best sounding product." [...] He said that he has [...] "strong views on the whole subject of digital consoles, which could fill an article with mostly purple prose", but he notes that [...] "best-in-class analog product these days is truly excellent, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>is</b> digital."

The French-speaking Montbéliardians were considered good candidates to emigrate since they were known to be [...] "very frugal, as well as strong independent laborers" [...] (Withrow, 2002). [...] As for the Germans (and likely the Swiss), Judge Debrisay quotes a number of stereotypes and impressions that developed and existed of the first German immigrants up to 1895, at least 140 years after their arrival. [...] "They are a big, square-shouldered, deep-chested race. [...] They do not talk much, but look as though they thought—easy going, and good tempered... they are hearty eaters, but they are not fussy and finikin over their food... so long as the dish is wholesome, and there is sufficient of it, they are satisfied... in the sensuous arts of painting and sculpture, the Germans are poor. [...] In the ennobling arts of literature and music they are great, and this fact provides a key to their character. [...] They are simple, earnest, homely, genuine people.
