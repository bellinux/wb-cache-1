500|$|The Norwegian Bratvaag Expedition, {{studying}} the glaciers and seas of the Svalbard archipelago from the Norwegian sealing vessel Bratvaag of Ålesund, found {{the remains of}} the Andrée expedition on August 5, 1930. [...] Kvitøya was usually inaccessible to the sealing or whaling ships of the time, as it is typically surrounded by a wide belt of thick polar ice and often hidden by thick ice fogs. However, summer in 1930 had been particularly warm, and the surrounding sea was practically free of ice. As Kvitøya was known to be a prime hunting ground for walrus and the fogs over the island on that day were comparatively thin, some of the crew of the Bratvaag took this rare opportunity to land on what they called the [...] "inaccessible island". Two of the sealers in search of water, Olav Salen and Karl Tusvick, discovered Andrée's boat near a small stream, frozen under a mound of snow and full of equipment, including a <b>boathook</b> engraved with the words [...] "Andrée's Polar Expedition, 1896". Presented with this hook, the Bratvaags captain, Peder Eliassen, assigned the crew to search the site together with the expedition members. Among other finds, they uncovered a journal and two skeletons, identified as Andrée's and Strindberg's remains by monograms found on their clothing.|$|E
60|$|She did not strike; {{the surf}} was level with her quarter, and Jake, {{thrusting}} {{down a long}} <b>boathook,</b> found no bottom. In another minute or two the water suddenly got smooth, and he threw down the <b>boathook.</b>|$|E
60|$|With a heavy <b>boathook</b> in {{his hand}} Randy Fairwell now ran ashore, {{followed}} by Ruff.|$|E
50|$|Suetonius {{records the}} rumours of lurid tales of sexual perversity and cruelty of Tiberius during the later {{part of his}} reign while he was living at Capri, Tiberius would execute people by having them thrown from a cliff into the sea while he watched. These people were {{tortured}} before being executed and if they survived the fall, men waiting below in boats would break their bones with oars and <b>boathooks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sighting Greenland on June 20, the {{expedition}} made harbor at the Crown Prince Islands (Whale Fish) in Disco Bay. From a British mail ship, {{they learned that}} British relief efforts were heading for the same region. Advance and Rescue left the islands on June 29, encountering the ice field on July 1 while proceeding towards Upernavik. By July 7, the pack ice was dense enough to compel the Advance to tow the Rescue to prevent the vessels from becoming separated. The crews were periodically sent onto the ice to 'bore' a passage by hand, using crowbars, ice anchors and <b>boathooks.</b> For 21 days the ships were held nearly fast, only heaved slowly forward by efforts of the crew.|$|R
5000|$|Wu Ta-k'uei was {{reputed to}} be a fierce fighter, and known as always ready to accept a {{challenge}} match. He {{is reported to have}} never been defeated, and to have been famous for badly injuring and taunting his opponents in those matches. An attested story circulated about Wu Ta-k'uei was about a fight that started in a Hong Kong dockside bar between an unarmed Wu Ta-k'uei and [...] "over 30" [...] stevedores armed with clubs and <b>boathooks.</b> The dockworkers eventually fled to a local police station for protection from the enraged Wu. Interviews with dockworkers and the police records of this fight led to sensational newspaper headlines in Kowloon and Hong Kong.|$|R
60|$|Straight {{from across}} the lake came the naptha launch {{belonging}} to Harry Parker's uncle. In the bow stood Harry, <b>boathook</b> in hand.|$|E
60|$|Never suspecting that he {{had been}} regaled with a string of falsehoods, the farmer let go with his <b>boathook,</b> and yacht and flatboat speedily drifted apart.|$|E
60|$|For {{half an hour}} they laboriously poled {{her with}} a long oar and the <b>boathook</b> between the banks of mire. Sometimes she touched and stuck until the rising water floated her off, and {{sometimes}} she scraped along the bottom, but still made progress. They were breathless and soaked with perspiration, while the foul scum that ran off the oar stained their damp clothes. Then Jake's <b>boathook</b> sank {{a foot or two}} deeper and finding the depth as good after a few vigorous pushes, they started the engine.|$|E
60|$|Until about midday the Pool of London was an {{astonishing}} scene. Steamboats and shipping {{of all sorts}} lay there, tempted by the enormous sums of money offered by fugitives, and {{it is said that}} many who swam out to these vessels were thrust off with <b>boathooks</b> and drowned. About one o'clock in the afternoon the thinning remnant of a cloud of the black vapour appeared between the arches of Blackfriars Bridge. At that the Pool became a scene of mad confusion, fighting, and collision, and for some time a multitude of boats and barges jammed in the northern arch of the Tower Bridge, and the sailors and lightermen had to fight savagely against the people who swarmed upon them from the riverfront. People were actually clambering down the piers of the bridge from above.|$|R
60|$|Harry {{threw the}} <b>boathook</b> and it caught {{fast in the}} steam launch's stern. Then the naptha launch was moved back, and away she went, {{carrying}} the steam launch with her.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, I'll do what I can for you," [...] {{said the}} man, and running up beside the yacht, {{which had become}} caught in a sudden calm, he made fast with a <b>boathook.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "We've {{struck a}} boy!" [...] shouted {{a man on}} the lighter, and then rushed forward with a <b>boathook.</b> As soon as he caught sight of Dick he fished the youth from the water and hurried ashore with him.|$|E
60|$|The boat swung round a little, edging {{in toward}} the beach, and Whitney saw by the ripples {{that they were in}} shallow water. Andrew let the {{staysail}} run down, but when he stood ready with the <b>boathook,</b> Elsie smiled.|$|E
6000|$|By {{this time}} the two yachts were almost side by side and running along at {{a high rate of}} speed. [...] Harris got out his <b>boathook</b> to catch fast to the Flyaway, when a cry from Tom made him pause.|$|E
60|$|One day Davy {{sat on a}} rock {{beside the}} sea, leaning on his father's <b>boathook,</b> and gazing with longing eyes out upon the clear calm ocean, on which several ships and boats were {{floating}} idly, for {{there was not a}} breath of wind to fill their sails.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pull her away, quick, Bill!" [...] cried Mumps in a {{low voice}} to the old sailor, who at once sprang forward and shoved the two yachts apart with a long <b>boathook.</b> Then the rudder of the Falcon was put hard a port, and she swung, away for a {{distance}} of half a dozen yards.|$|E
60|$|They sat in {{the cockpit}} to wait, and the noise the current made as it swirled round her died away. She was not quite afloat, however, and Whitney was picking up the <b>boathook</b> when a flicker of light shone through the fog. He raised his hand in warning to Andrew, and both saw the faint gleam go out.|$|E
60|$|Preparatory to quitting their sledge, {{the men had}} loaded {{themselves}} with eight pounds of pemmican and two of biscuit, besides the artificial horizon, sextant, and compass, a rifle, and a <b>boathook.</b> They had not been an hour gone when, as above stated, four of the dogs overtook them. An hour afterwards they came upon a polar bear with her cub.|$|E
60|$|To his wife's amazement, he {{actually}} {{walked away from}} the insensible man, and with a <b>boathook</b> reached for his hat, which was floating by. Mrs. Gibbs, still gazing in blank astonishment, caught a seraphic smile on the face of her brother as Miss Harris continued her ministrations, and in a pardonable fit of temper the overwrought woman gave him a box on the ear, which brought him round at once.|$|E
6000|$|... "The next {{sea that}} struck the lifeboat," [...] {{continues}} the coxswain, [...] "landed her within {{six feet of}} the foundation-stone of Tynemouth Dock, with a quickness seldom witnessed. The crew plied the remaining two oars to leeward against the rudder and <b>boathook.</b> We never saw anything till coming near the three Shields lifeboats. We asked them for oars to proceed back to the Friendship, but they had none to spare." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Mr. George. [...] "You {{may play}} about {{wherever}} you are sure it is safe. Don't go {{near the edge of}} the pier, unless there is somebody at hand to pull you out of the water with a <b>boathook,</b> if you fall in. Amuse yourself as long as you can; and when you are tired of taking care of yourself, come to me, and I will tell you what to do." ...|$|E
60|$|They went on, keeping, {{so far as}} {{they could}} judge, midway between reef and beach, but after a time the lead showed {{shoaling}} water and Jake used the <b>boathook</b> instead. Then the sky cleared and a half-moon came out, and they saw haze and the loom of trees outshore of them. Slowing the engine, they moved on cautiously while the water gradually got shallower, until glistening banks of mud began to break the surface. Then they stopped the engine, but found the launch still moved forward.|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph, I'll {{investigate}} this," [...] muttered the captain, {{and went}} off for a <b>boathook.</b> When he returned he caught the hook into the loop of the wire and tried to bring {{the end of the}} strand to the deck. He was unable to do it alone and had to get the boys to aid him. Then all three ran the wire around a brace and gradually hauled it aboard. At the end was an iron chain, fastened into several loops, and also the anchor to one of the rowboats.|$|E
60|$|Tight-wrapped in {{his cloak}} against the icy whips {{of the black}} winter's night, a portly gentleman, well {{advanced}} in years, picked his way carefully down the wet, slippery steps of the jetty {{by the light of}} a lanthorn, whose rays gleamed lividly on crushed brown seaweed and trailing green sea slime. Leaning heavily upon the arm which a sailor held out to his assistance, he stepped into the waiting boat that rose and fell on the heaving black waters. A <b>boathook</b> scraped against the stones, and the frail craft was pushed off.|$|E
60|$|She struck it, with a {{crash that}} flung {{two or three of}} the Spaniards staggering, and it {{crumpled}} up before her. Mangrove boughs came streaming down on her grinding forecastle, torn limbs clutched at rail and stanchion, and were smashed by them. Mire was whirled aloft by the thudding screw, and Austin, gripping his telegraph, laughed a harsh laugh as he saw that she was going through. How thick that belt of trees was, or what water flowed among their roots, he did not know, but he remembered that he had found no bottom among them in other places with a <b>boathook,</b> now and then.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I {{have noticed}} (excuse me) that you shut {{yourself}} {{up a good}} deal, and that you seem to like my garden aloft here. If you would like {{a little more of}} it, I could throw out a few lines and stays between my windows and yours, which the runners would take to directly. And I have some boxes, both of mignonette and wall-flower, that I could shove on along the gutter (with a <b>boathook</b> I have by me) to your windows, and draw back again when they wanted watering or gardening, and shove on again when they were ship-shape; so that they would cause you no trouble. I couldn’t take this liberty without asking your permission, so I venture to ask it. Tartar, corresponding set, next door.’ ...|$|E
60|$|To {{drive the}} boat ahead was {{exhausting}} labour in the burning sun, and {{by and by}} Kit relieved a man whose efforts got slack. His clothes had dried stiff, his hair was full of sand, and the salt had crystallised on his burned skin. At length they stopped abreast of the steamer's gangway and somebody threw a rope. Mossamedes rolled, lifting a long belt of rusty side out of the foam. Sometimes she was high above the boat, and sometimes she sank until the water splashed about the open iron doors. A man, seizing a <b>boathook,</b> stood ready to fend-off the launch; the others got canvas bands under the camels. Then a long derrick swung out and a band was hooked to a wire rope.|$|E
60|$|He hooked {{one knee}} around the brace, gripped {{it between his}} ankles and slackened the grip of his hands. The topsails slid away from him, the spray rushed up below, his feet struck the rail, and the next moment he was down in utter {{blackness}} and conscious of a shock of icy cold water. He rose gasping and swung around, buffeted in the vessel's eddying wake. There was no shouting on board her, and, with a choking cry, he struck out for the black shape of the tug, now only a short distance away. Somebody heard and flung down a line. He clutched at it and, by good fortune, grasped it. Head downward he was drawn on board by {{the aid of a}} long <b>boathook,</b> and hauled, dripping, before the skipper.|$|E
60|$|Love? {{said the}} night-watchman, {{as he watched}} in an {{abstracted}} fashion the efforts of a skipper to reach a brother skipper on a passing barge with a <b>boathook.</b> Don't {{talk to me about}} love, because I've suffered enough through it. There ought to be teetotalers for love the same as wot there is for drink, and they ought to wear a piece o' ribbon to show it, the same as the teetotalers do; but not an attractive piece o' ribbon, mind you. I've seen as much mischief caused by love as by drink, and the funny thing is, one often leads to the other. Love, arter it is over, often leads to drink, and drink often leads to love and to a man committing himself for life afore it is over.|$|E
60|$|Then {{they tried}} to set some kind of sail by aid of a <b>boathook,</b> but while they were doing this, the boat, which had drifted side on to the great waves raised by the gale upon {{the face of the}} broad river, overturned. I saw some of the men {{clinging}} to the boat and one or two scrambling on to her keel, but what chanced to them and the others I do not know, who had rushed to the steering gear to set the ship upon her course again, lest her fate should be that of the boat, or we should go ashore and be captured by those who galloped on the bank, or be drowned. This was the last I ever saw or heard of the crew of the Blanche.|$|E
60|$|The gin {{was found}} in the dead captain's cabin; it was brought on deck, and all hands had a dram, and {{attacked}} their further task. The night was come, the moon would not be up for hours; a lamp was set on the main hatch to light Amalu as he washed down decks; and the galley lantern was taken to guide the others in their graveyard business. Holdorsen, Hemstead, Trent, and Goddedaal were first disposed of, the last still breathing as he went over the side; Wallen followed; and then Wicks, steadied by the gin, went aloft with the <b>boathook</b> and succeeded in dislodging Hardy. The Chinaman was their last task; he seemed to be light-headed, talked aloud in his unknown language as they brought him up, and it was only with the splash of his sinking body that the gibberish ceased. Brown, by common consent, was left alone. Flesh and blood could go no further.|$|E
6000|$|At {{that moment}} he moved the <b>boathook,</b> and the crab ran away in such a desperate hurry that Davy opened his eyes wide and said, [...] "Humph! maybe ye're not a happy beast after all!" [...] While he sat thus, a stout {{fisherman}} came up and {{asked him what he}} was thinking about. On being told, he said, [...] "Will you come with me, boy, to the building-yard, and I'll show you a ship on the `stocks.' I'm goin' as one of her crew when she's ready for sea, and perhaps by that time your father will let you go too." [...] You may be sure that Davy did not refuse such a good offer; so the man and the boy went hand in hand to the yard where ships were built. Davy had never been there before, and great was his surprise when he saw a huge thing standing on dry land, with great pieces of wood of all shapes sticking round it, like the skeleton of a whale; but greater still was his surprise when the fisherman said, [...] "There, lad, that's the ship." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{figures in}} this boat {{were those of}} a strong man with ragged grizzled hair and a sun-browned face, and a dark girl of {{nineteen}} or twenty, sufficiently like him to be recognizable as his daughter. The girl rowed, pulling a pair of sculls very easily; the man, with the rudder-lines slack in his hands, and his hands loose in his waistband, kept an eager look out. He had no net, hook, or line, {{and he could not}} be a fisherman; his boat had no cushion for a sitter, no paint, no inscription, no appliance beyond a rusty <b>boathook</b> and a coil of rope, and he could not be a waterman; his boat was too crazy and too small to take in cargo for delivery, and he could not be a lighterman or river-carrier; there was no clue to what he looked for, but he looked for something, with a most intent and searching gaze. The tide, which had turned an hour before, was running down, and his eyes watched every little race and eddy in its broad sweep, as the boat made slight head-way against it, or drove stern foremost before it, according as he directed his daughter by a movement of his head. She watched his face as earnestly as he watched the river. But, in the intensity of her look there was a touch of dread or horror.|$|E
6000|$|... ''Scuse ME, Lawyer Lightwood, it's {{a part of}} the truth, and as such I do mind it, and I must mind it and I will mind it. [...] "Rogue Riderhood," [...] he says, [...] "words passed betwixt us on {{the river}} tonight." [...] Which they had; ask his daughter! [...] "I {{threatened}} you," [...] he says, [...] "to chop you over the fingers with my boat's stretcher, or take a aim at your brains with my <b>boathook.</b> I did so on accounts of your looking too hard at what I had in tow, as if you was suspicious, and on accounts of your holding on to the gunwale of my boat." [...] I says to him, [...] "Gaffer, I know it." [...] He says to me, [...] "Rogue Riderhood, you are a man in a dozen"--I think he said in a score, but of that I am not positive, so take the lowest figure, for precious be the obligations of a Alfred David. [...] "And," [...] he says, [...] "when your fellow-men is up, be it their lives or be it their watches, sharp is ever the word with you. Had you suspicions?" [...] I says, [...] "Gaffer, I had; and what's more, I have." [...] He falls a shaking, and he says, [...] "Of what?" [...] I says, [...] "Of foul play." [...] He falls a shaking worse, and he says, [...] "There WAS foul play then. I done it for his money. Don't betray me!" [...] Those were the words as ever he used.' ...|$|E
60|$|The tides {{were now}} {{in that state}} which sailors term the dead of the neap, {{and it was not}} {{expected}} that any part of the rock would be seen above water to-day; at any rate, it was obvious, from the experience of yesterday, that no work could be done upon it, and therefore the artificers were not required to land. The wind was at west, with light breezes, and fine clear weather; and as it was an object with the writer to know the actual state of the Bell Rock at neap-tides, he got one of the boats manned, and, being accompanied by the landing-master, went to it at a quarter-past twelve. The parts of the rock that appeared above water being very trifling, were covered by every wave, so that no landing was made. Upon trying the depth of water with a <b>boathook,</b> particularly on the sites of the lighthouse and beacon, on the former, at low water, the depth was found to be three feet, and on the central parts of the latter it was ascertained to be two feet eight inches. Having made these remarks, the boat returned to the ship at two p.m., and the weather being good, the artificers were found amusing themselves with fishing. The Smeaton came from Arbroath this afternoon, and made fast to her moorings, having brought letters and newspapers, with parcels of clean linen, etc., for the workmen, who were also made happy by the arrival of three of their comrades from the workyard ashore. From these men they not only received all the news of the workyard, but seemed themselves to enjoy great pleasure in communicating whatever they considered to be interesting with regard to the rock. Some also got letters from their friends at a distance, the postage of which for the men afloat was always free, so that they corresponded the more readily.|$|E
