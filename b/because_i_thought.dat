25|$|Lee enjoyed basic medical studies after {{entering}} the medical department. He finished his first research paper in his freshman year, {{which was published}} in the Taiwanese Medical Magazine (台灣醫學雜誌). After graduating in 1940, Lee decided to quit clinical medicine and keep on studying. He became the assistant of Tsungming Tu, who was researching on basic medical studies and, at the time, the only Taiwanese professors in the medical department. He once said, To gain honor for Taiwan, dignity for the Taiwanese, I chose to follow Professor Tu instead of several other Japanese professors. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> Professor Tu was our people, and we should help him.|$|E
25|$|A lot {{of people}} just assume I took some Beatles and, you know, threw some Jay-Z on top of it or mixed it up or looped it around, but it's really a deconstruction. It's not an easy thing to do. I was obsessed with the whole project, that's all I was trying to do, see if I could do this. Once I got into it, I didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing it. I stuck to those two <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music. You can do different things, it doesn't have to be just what some people call stealing. It can be a lot more than that.|$|E
500|$|Warren voted as a Republican {{for many}} years, saying, [...] "I was a Republican <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that {{those were the}} people who best {{supported}} markets". According to Warren, she began to vote Democratic in 1995 because she no longer believed that to be true, but she states that she has voted for both parties because she believed that neither party should dominate.|$|E

6000|$|... "And I’m sure it’s {{very kind}} of you," [...] {{continued}} the girl, [...] "and if I’ve hurt your feelings by refusing you, it is only <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> perhaps <b>I</b> was {{not good enough for}} you." ...|$|R
500|$|On {{taking the}} role of Jigsaw, Bell said - [...] "I did Saw <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was a {{fascinating}} location for a film to be made. These guys locked in a room, to me, was fresh. I did not anticipate the ending when I read the script, so I was quite caught by surprise {{and it was clear}} to me that if the filmmakers shot the scene well, the audience would be caught by surprise as well. The film was worth doing for that moment alone." ...|$|E
500|$|Nutter said of {{the episode}} [...] "I really worked hard {{to make it a}} special show, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was special. It was Gillian's {{post-traumatic}} stress episode, because she had not really had the opportunity to vent her feelings about the whole Duane Barry situation. This was an opportunity to sit back and let all that happen." [...] Carter particularly liked the scene where a clearly disturbed Scully hugs Mulder, claiming it was a [...] "tender moment" [...] between two characters that had not shown that much affection for each other.|$|E
500|$|With word of {{the episode}} out, {{backlash}} began. The studio received at least one bomb threat and Driscoll received a telephone call informing him {{he was going to}} Hell. DeGeneres was followed by car to the studio on at least one occasion by a [...] "suspicious man". Some within the entertainment industry assumed that the coming out was simply a ratings stunt, to which DeGeneres responded, [...] "I did it selfishly for myself and <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was a great thing for the show, which desperately needed a point of view." ...|$|E
5000|$|When Filchock {{was asked}} about his plans, he replied [...] "I haven't made any future plans simply <b>because</b> <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> of being out of football. I still want to play football. I guess I always will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense," [...] said Key hurriedly. [...] "We really saw nothing--it {{was all a}} fancy; and Uncle Dick {{was joking}} me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> said <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> saw a woman's face," [...] he added with a forced laugh.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind, Sir Julien," [...] she answered. [...] "I have waited <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> {{that there was}} a chance that he might come, and to sup alone is a drear thing. If {{monsieur}} really--Ah! Behold! After all, it is he! It is he who comes. What happiness!" ...|$|R
500|$|At one point, Chabon {{submitted}} a 672-page draft to his agent and editor, who disliked the work. Chabon had problems dropping the novel, though. [...] "It was really scary," [...] he said later. [...] "I'd already {{signed a contract}} and been paid all this money. And then I'd gotten a divorce and half the money was already with my ex-wife. My instincts were telling me, This book is fucked. Just drop it. But I didn't, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> What if I {{have to give the}} money back?" [...] "I used to go down to my office and fantasize about all the books I could write instead." ...|$|E
500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole, {{who plays}} junior FBI agent Astrid Farnsworth, {{described}} the episode in a May 2009 interview, [...] "It's about spontaneously combusting. This is the episode I get {{to get out}} of the lab. I remember thinking I can't wait to see what the set's going to look like and how they will make it look when the spontaneous combusting takes place. And we get there and it's just smoke on the walls, like a kitchen fire. I thought that was so funny <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> there were going to be body parts everywhere, like a small explosion. But it's a really good episode, which leads you into the coolest parts of the finale episode." ...|$|E
500|$|Rice {{initially}} {{expressed an}} adamant stance against fan fiction {{based on her}} works, and particularly in opposition to such fiction based on The Vampire Chronicles, releasing a statement on April 7, 2000, that disallowed all such efforts, citing copyright issues. She subsequently requested that FanFiction.Net remove stories featuring her characters. In 2012, Metro reported that Rice developed a milder stance on the issue. [...] "I got upset about 20 years ago <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it would block me," [...] she said. [...] "However, it's been very easy to avoid reading any, so live and let live. If I were a young writer, I'd want to own my own ideas. But maybe fan fiction is a transitional phase: whatever gets you there, gets you there." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hewson reflected. [...] "I don't {{see how it}} can. I {{was trying}} to come to you, when I got your note, to say that St. John had been to see me, and offered to release me from my offer, <b>because,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> you had made him a better one. He's amusingly rapacious, St. John is." ...|$|R
30|$|I {{would say}} that if I have {{different}} approaches and perspectives, then I am more resilient in the first step <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have probably <b>thought</b> of more critical things (Expert J).|$|R
6000|$|... "The dentist!" [...] he repeated. [...] "Six {{hours in}} the spiritual abyss, and all <b>because</b> <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> of the dentist! Such a simple, such a {{beautiful}} and peaceful thought! Friends, we have passed a night in hell; but now the sun is risen, the birds are singing, and the radiant form of the dentist consoles the world." ...|$|R
500|$|Of the end result, Spotnitz said [...] "I {{was very}} pleased with the way it was executed, and I {{think it was a good}} mystery. He later wrote that he [...] "liked [...] more as time has gone on." [...] Director Rob Bowman {{admitted}} to being tired and not inspired by the time this episode—the second to last of the season—was produced. This lack of interest later resulted in the episode taking extra time to finish. Bowman later recalled that the most difficult aspect of the episode was filming the climactic human sacrifice scene, if only because of the ceremonial mask featured. He explained, [...] "the mask scared the hell out of me only <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> 'Boy, if I don't shoot this right, it's going to be silly." ...|$|E
500|$|Shira is {{frequently}} shown playing the accordion, which Hadas Yaron {{did not know}} how to play. She described it as a [...] "very difficult instrument" [...] and stated, [...] "There was so much noise in [...] It was like rrrrrrnnnnngh , I was faking the melody and it was ugly, very weird stuff. I had to really switch this button [...] like don't listen to it and feel what you’'re feeling. It took a while because at the beginning, I was very aware of playing this horrible melody, if you could call it a melody, and I knew I had to feel something. It took a few takes <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> 'oh, how could [...] listen to that? The cinematographer!' It took a while to ignore that and just be in the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Cocktails" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Lieberstein, who plays Human Resources {{representative}} Toby Flenderson on the series. Lost series creator J. J. Abrams was hired on as episode director, his first such credit for the series. Abrams disliked the American series when it first premiered, due to his love for the original British series. The director explained, [...] "I resented it before I saw it, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> 'well, {{how are you going}} to do what Ricky and Steve did. In fact, the first season I didn't get into it at all. In the second season, they really found their voice. And that's despite having to make 22 episodes, which is twice the length of what the BBC show did. And I thought that the show became brilliant. I was really impressed by how it worked." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a 2004 interview, Oakes said: [...] "My {{personal}} {{politics are}} pretty much in the middle, I would think. I've voted both ways at various times. I don't know if perceptions about my politics influence whether people will be interviewed. Paul Keating used to boycott the program every now and again; not <b>because</b> he <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was a Liberal but <b>because</b> he <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't toe the line. Paul believed in rewards and punishment." ...|$|R
6000|$|Clive. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> always <b>thought</b> that fairy somehow must be {{the most}} {{beautiful}} creature in all the world--that is [...] "why and because." [...] Do not make me Mayfair curtsies. You know whether you are good-looking or not: and how long <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> you so. <b>I</b> remember when <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> {{would like to be}} Ethel's knight, and that if there was anything she would have me do, I would try and achieve it in order to please her. I remember when I was so ignorant I did not know there was any difference in rank between us.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, Harriet! I {{know better}} than that. It is quite impossible. Besides, I am sure of this--that the hands that wedded me are the same hands that caress me," [...] she added, with another {{blushing}} effort, [...] "strong but delicate hands, rather hard inside, as with the bridle. <b>I</b> noticed it <b>because</b> once <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> his hands soft with doing nothing and being shut up." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Love the Way You Lie" [...] and [...] "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)" [...] {{were based}} on a demo written and {{recorded}} in late 2009 by Grey. Grey told PopEater [...] "I wrote the demo initially for myself <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> ‘Oh, I have this big song, and now I {{have a little bit of}} a launching pad to put out my own stuff." [...] Grey continued to discuss how the song was ultimately included on Loud, saying [...] "As soon as Rihanna and her team heard my demo, they were like, ‘Oh we want it for Rihanna’s album,’ so I had to make the decision if I was going to let them have it or not. But I did and so it was on Rihanna’s album, too." [...] The demo track by Grey is on her extended play The Buried Sessions of Skylar Grey, which was released on January 17, 2012.|$|E
500|$|Gittings {{began to}} {{hitchhike}} on weekends to New York City, {{dressed as a}} man, to visit gay bars since she knew of none in Philadelphia, and knew of no other places to go to get [...] "plugged into the gay community." [...] In a 1975 interview, she recalled, [...] "I wore drag <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that {{was a way to}} show I was gay. It's changed now, but in the early 50s there were basically two types of women in the gay bars: the so-called butch ones in short hair and plain masculine attire and the so-called femme ones in dresses and high heels and makeup. I knew high heels and makeup weren't my personal style, so I thought...I must be the other kind!" [...] However, Gittings found very little in common with the women she met in the bars, and after witnessing a gay male acquaintance get beaten up after leaving a bar, began to focus her energies on collecting books.|$|E
500|$|McDiarmid was {{surprised}} when Lucas approached him 16 years after Return of the Jedi to reprise the role of Palpatine. In an interview, he stated, [...] "When we were doing Return of the Jedi there was a rumor that George Lucas had nine films in his head, and he'd clearly just completed three of them." [...] McDiarmid added, [...] "Someone said that, 'Oh, I think what he might do next is go back in time, and show how Vader came to be.' It {{never occurred to me}} in a million years that I would be involved in that, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> 'oh well, then he'll get a much younger actor [...]' That would be obvious." [...] However, [...] "I was the right age, ironically, for the first prequel when it was made. ... So I was in the very strange and rather wonderful paradox of playing myself when young at my own age, having played myself previously when 100-and-I-don't-know-what." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And she wouldn't {{have them}} <b>because</b> she <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> sent them! As sure as I'm {{standing}} here, I never did it," [...] said the clerk, solemnly.|$|R
5000|$|... "I'm a Reading boy and I don't think I {{was given}} a fair chance. Maybe things would have been {{different}} if Pards hadn't left, it's hard to say. Steve Coppellis the new manager and he has got his own ideas but I'm obviously not part of that. It's upsetting for me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> really <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> could do a lot for Reading. Tyson found himself surplus to requirement at the Madejski Stadium in the 2003-04 season after manager Alan Pardew left the club in October.|$|R
5000|$|After a fifth-place finish, Larson {{said that}} he [...] "didn’t need that last caution. It {{probably}} cost me or Brad (Keselowski) a win, but it did make it somewhat exciting at the end. Disappointed that we didn’t get the win <b>because</b> <b>I</b> really <b>thought</b> we were about two to three laps away from passing Brad for the lead. We will just go back next season and try and fight for some more wins." ...|$|R
500|$|Nhu's agents soon {{reported}} Có's {{activities to}} the palace. When the Ngô brothers confronted Đính with what occurred in Mỹ Tho, Đính feigned astonishment at his deputy's behaviour. He began crying and said [...] "This is my fault, {{because you have}} suspected me. I have not really gone {{to work for the}} last 15 days but have stayed at home because I was sad. But I am not against you. I was sad <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I was discredited with you. So Nguyễn Hữu Có profited from my absence to make trouble." [...] Đính claimed to know nothing of Có's activities and vowed to have his deputy killed. Nhu opposed this and stated that he wanted keep Có alive to catch the plotters, and tried to use Đính to this end. Nhu ordered Đính and Tung, both of whom took their orders directly from the palace instead of the ARVN command, to plan a fake coup against the government. One objective was to trick dissidents into joining the false uprising so that they could be identified and eliminated. Another aim of the public relations stunt was to give a false impression of the strength of the regime.|$|E
500|$|Warner Bros. {{purchased}} the film rights, intending Harold Becker to direct and Robert Shapiro to produce. Tom Stoppard {{wrote the first}} draft of the screenplay, on which Ballard briefly collaborated. Becker dropped out, and David Lean came to direct with Spielberg as producer. Lean explained, [...] "I worked on it for about a year and in the end I gave it up <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was too similar to a diary. It was well-written and interesting, but I gave it to Steve." [...] Spielberg felt [...] "from the moment I read J. G. Ballard's novel I secretly wanted to direct myself." [...] Spielberg found the project to be very personal. As a child, his favorite film was Lean's The Bridge on the River Kwai, which similarly takes place in a Japanese prisoner of war camp. Spielberg's fascination with World War II and the aircraft of that era was stimulated by his father's stories of his experience as a radio operator on North American B-25 Mitchell bombers in the China-Burma Theater. Spielberg hired Menno Meyjes to do an uncredited rewrite before Stoppard was brought back to write the shooting script.|$|E
500|$|As well {{as using}} {{existing}} music, {{such as the}} themes for the Daleks, Cybermen, and Rose, Murray Gold specially composed {{a piece of music}} for Rose's farewell entitled [...] "Doomsday", which featured vocal work from Melanie Pappenheim. Instead of using the swelling violins that Davies {{and the rest of the}} production team had expected, Gold took a minimalist approach. When pitching the track to the production team, Gold described the track as representing Rose's unbridled energy and determination as she searches for the Doctor. He later said, [...] "I wanted to get that kind of throbbing, sort of hurt sound of quite emotional rock, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that's what Rose would do if she was hurting and ran up to her bedroom and locked herself in her room and had a good old cry, really." [...] The piece uses the same vocal work from [...] "Rose", when Rose first enters the TARDIS, thus creating a bookend effect. It is a favourite among fans and of executive producer Julie Gardner, and is one of the reasons, along with Pappenheim's overall contribution and the [...] "Song for Ten" [...] from [...] "The Christmas Invasion", that the [...] was released several months later.|$|E
60|$|I saw him to-day, {{seated at}} the desk, writing. It gave me quite a shock, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> he was quite dispelled. Nevertheless, on looking steadily, I {{found that he was}} not there--the old {{familiar}} trick of the brain. I have dwelt too long on what has happened. I am becoming morbid, and my old indigestion is hinting and muttering. I shall take exercise. Each day I shall walk for two hours.|$|R
5000|$|.....the thing I {{became aware}} of {{was that there was}} no human face for that period. So this is where the {{accidental}} historian came into play. <b>Because</b> when <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of John and Sunday, Danila and Joy already gone, then the rest of us of course would follow in rotation. There’s no escaping that simple brute reality of existence, and so I developed this tremendous urge...to try and get what I could done in painting what I knew of them all.|$|R
5000|$|Jim Verraros was {{the first}} openly gay {{contestant}} on the show. He was told by FOX to remove all gay comments from his online journal. Verraros later explained, [...] "It wasn't <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was gay. It was <b>because</b> they <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was trying to gain more votes and have that little extra edge." ...|$|R
