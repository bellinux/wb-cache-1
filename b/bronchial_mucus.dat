40|$|ABSTRACT: Cough and {{expectoration}} of mucus are {{the best-known}} symptoms {{in patients with}} pulmonary disease. The most applied intervention for these symptoms {{is the use of}} chest physiotherapy to increase <b>bronchial</b> <b>mucus</b> transport and reduce retention of mucus in the airways. Chest physiotherapy interventions can be evaluated using different outcome variables, such as <b>bronchial</b> <b>mucus</b> transport measurement, measurement of the amount of expectorated mucus, pulmonary function, medication use, frequency of exacerbation and quality of life. Measurement of the transport rate of mucus in the airways using a radioactive tracer appears to be an appropriate outcome variable for short-term studies. Evaluation of chest physiotherapy only with pulmonary function tests appears to be inadequate in short-term studies. The popularity of using pulmonary function tests is probably based more on the availability of the instruments than on a theoretical basis related to the question of chest physiotherapy improving mucus transport. Quality of life and progression of the disease are not often used as outcome variables, but it may be worthwhile to use these in the future...|$|E

40|$|Asthma is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} {{disease of the}} airways. Anti-inflammatory drug therapy, primarily using corticosteroids, is now considered the first-line treatment {{in the management of}} all grades of asthma severity. Although corticosteroids are believed to be the most potent anti-inflammatory agents available, they do not suppress all inflammatory mediators involved in the asthmatic response. Leukotrienes, which are lipid mediators generated from the metabolism of arachidonic acid, {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of asthma. They produce bronchospasm, increase <b>bronchial</b> hyperresponsiveness, <b>mucus</b> production, and mucosal edema, and enhance airway smooth muscle cell proliferation and eosinophil recruitment into the airways, and their synthesis or release is unaffected by corticosteroid administration. The use of leukotriene synthesis inhibitors or leukotriene receptor antagonists as anti-inflammatory therapies in asthma has therefore been investigated.

Coughing in tetraplegic patients {{is thought to be}} insufficient because of severely impaired expiratory muscle function. More recently, however, {{it has been reported that}} many tetraplegic patients may have dynamic airway compression and thus a more or less effective cough. Methods. Mucus clearance was measured using a radioactive aerosol tracer technique during 45 minutes on 2 days: once without intervention, and once with voluntary coughing in the period 15 to 30 minutes (once every 30 seconds). Measurements were done in a randomized order. For each day, individual slopes for the decrease in radioactivity were calculated, reflecting mucus transport in the peripheral, central, and the whole lung region. Results. Significant differences in slopes were found between the control day and the cough day in the peripheral lung region for the interval 0 to 30 minutes and in the whole lung region for the interval 0 to 30 minutes and 0 to 45 minutes. The improvement of mucus clearance due to coughing, however, was relatively small in these patients, only 3 % after 45 minutes: from 4 % whole lung clearance during quiet breathing to 7 % whole lung clearance during coughing.

Objectives: We assessed the potential efficacy of inhaled anti-IL- 13 monoclonal antibody Fab' fragment on allergen-induced airway inflammation, hyperresponsiveness and remodeling in an experimental model of allergic asthma. Anti-IL- 13 Fab' was administered to mice as a liquid aerosol generated by inExpose® inhalation system in a tower allowing a nose-only exposure. Methods: BALB/c mice were treated by PBS, anti-IL- 13 Fab' or A 33 Fab' fragment and subjected to ovalbumin (OVA) exposure for 1 and 5 weeks (short term (ST) and long term (LT) protocols). Measurements and Main Results: Our data demonstrate a significant anti-asthma effect following nebulization of anti-IL- 13 Fab' in a model of asthma driven by allergen exposure as compared to saline and non-immune Fab fragments. In short and long terms protocols, administration of the anti-IL- 13 Fab' by inhalation significantly decreased bronchial responsiveness to methacholine, BALF eosinophilia, inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissue, and many features of airway remodeling. Levels of pro-inflammatory mediators and matrix metalloprotease levels were significantly lower in lung parenchyma of mice treated with anti-IL- 13 Fab'. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that an inhaled anti-IL- 13 Fab' significantly reduces airway inflammation, hyperresponsiveness and remodeling.

30|$|Asthma is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} airway disease arising from a complex {{interaction between the}} immune system and resident cells of the lung to induce the cardinal features of <b>bronchial</b> hyper-responsiveness, increased <b>mucus</b> production, narrowing of the airways and airway remodelling. A detailed review of the pathophysiology of asthma has been covered extensively elsewhere and is outside the scope of our article [1, 7, 8]. The most important clinical consequences of this inflammatory process are the exacerbations of disease causing airway narrowing and debilitating bouts of shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness and cough. Most asthma treatments aim to control these symptoms and reduce the frequency of exacerbations and current recommendations advocate the use of anti-inflammatory treatments, in particular inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and bronchodilators such as short and long acting β 2 -adrenergic agonists (LABA; 5). However, there is concern around the inappropriate use of asthma medications, in particular the overuse of inhaled corticosteroids in children, which can effect bone growth, and the inappropriate use of long acting bronchodilator therapy in isolation which has been associated with increased morbidity [9]. As well as the risk of these possible adverse effects not all patients respond to these treatments and non-adherence to treatment is common due to issues such as complex treatment regimens, poor inhalation technique and delayed results [10] thus there is an unmet medical need for complementary therapies for asthma.|$|R
