30|$|Age was {{significant}} (p <  0.01) and positively influenced a farmer using his/her <b>bare</b> <b>hands</b> to stir chemicals during pesticide application. This {{could be due}} to the fact that older farmers are reluctant to adopt best farming practices. However, farming experience, negatively influenced (p <  0.01) a farmer stirring pesticides with <b>bare</b> <b>hands.</b> This might be due to farmers acquiring knowledge on the health implications of stirring chemicals with the <b>bare</b> <b>hands</b> from experience. Also, farmer based organisations might have educated farmers on best safety issues during pesticides application.

40|$|Windsurfers {{currently}} do {{not wear}} neoprene gloves when sailing in cold temperatures, as discomfort rapidly develops in the forearms when doing so. Lack of good protection against low temperatures means the hands get painfully cold and numb, limiting sailing time and pleasure. ElectroMyoGraphy (EMG) measurements were done on four forearm muscles of 10 healthy, experienced male windsurfers performing a windsurfing-like task, to find differences in muscle activation between the <b>bare</b> <b>hand,</b> two glove types, and a newly developed experimental prototype. Significantly less EMG activity {{was associated with}} the prototype condition for three out of four muscles, compared to the <b>bare</b> <b>hand</b> and glove conditions. No significant differences in muscle activation were found between the <b>bare</b> <b>hand</b> and the two glove conditions. Results of a questionnaire revealed that subjects found both glove conditions significantly more tiring than the <b>bare</b> <b>hand</b> and prototype conditions. The EMG measurement results indicate that the experimental prototype allows sailors to transfer forces between arm and boom with less effort than in <b>bare</b> <b>hand</b> or gloved conditions, but a probable cause of the forearm discomfort when wearing gloves was not found.

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{influence}} of waterproof covering on finger skin temperature (FST) and hand pain during immersion test for diagnosing hand-arm vibration syndrome complying with the proposal of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO/ CD 14835 - 1, 2001) for measurement procedure. Six healthy male subjects took part in the immersion tests and immersed their both hands into water at 12 °C for 5 min, repeatedly with two types of waterproof covering (polyethylene and natural rubber gloves) or without <b>hand</b> covering (<b>bare</b> <b>hands)</b> during immersion. The FST data from middle fingers and subjective pain scores for hand pain were analyzed. Statistically significant differences in FST among three conditions were observed showing the highest FST with natural rubber gloves, followed by the FST with polyethylene gloves and the lowest with <b>bare</b> <b>hands.</b> Significant differences in pain score among three conditions were observed during immersion showing the lowest pain score with natural rubber gloves, followed by the pain score with polyethylene gloves and the highest with <b>bare</b> <b>hands.</b> Immersion test with polyethylene gloves instead of <b>bare</b> <b>hands</b> during immersion seems to be suitable for reducing subject suffering...|$|R
