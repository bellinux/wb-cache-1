Methanol-wetted zinc borates produced either from <b>borax</b> <b>decahydrate</b> and zinc nitrate hexahydrate (2 ZnO · 3 B 2 O 3 · 7 H 2 O) or from zinc oxide and boric acid (2 ZnO · 3 B 2 O 3 · 3 H 2 O) were dried by both conventional and supercritical carbon dioxide drying methods. Zinc borate samples dried by both techniques were characterized using analytical titration, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that while zinc borate obtained from zinc oxide and boric acid {{did not have any}} chemical interaction with CO 2, carbonates were formed on the surface of zinc borate obtained from <b>borax</b> <b>decahydrate</b> and zinc nitrate hexahydrate. The main factor for the carbonate formation during supercritical CO 2 drying is anticipated as the structural differences of zinc borate species. CO 2 is a nonpolar solvent, and it does not usually react with polar substances unless water is present in the medium. While 2 ZnO · 3 B 2 O 3 · 3 H 2 O had three bound OH groups, 2 ZnO · 3 B 2 O 3 · 7 H 2 O had five bound OH groups and one mole of water of crystallization. It is proposed that the water of crystallization reacts with CO 2 forming carbonic acid. Then, carbonic acid, which is stronger than boric acid, substitutes borate ions from their zinc salts.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Boron and boron {{compounds}} {{have been}} long used for pressure treatment, dip-diffusion, and remedial treatments of wood {{because of their}} proven efficacy against fungi and insects. These materials are especially attractive because their high water solubility promotes deeper penetration into wood. Other useful properties of boron include its neutral pH, non-corrosiveness, lack of color or odor, and little or no effect on wood strength. Boron also has low-mammalian toxicity and minimal environmental effects. However, high water solubility limits outdoor applications because the boron will leach from the wood when it is exposed to rain or is in direct soil contact. Boron is widely used as a component in external remedial pastes, primarily as disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (DOT). This boron compound has higher water solubility and only remains in wood 3 to 7 years after application. Using differing degrees of water solubilities in the paste system might result in longer-term protection.

40|$|Lubricating oil {{additives}} based on boron compounds are promising materials for lubrication {{due to their}} tribological advantages such as antiwear efficiency, good film strength, and high temperature resistance. This article deals with the preparation of zinc borate particles that are well dispersed and colloidally stabilized in mineral oil. This method starts with preparing two inverse emulsions (water-in-oil) with sorbitan monostearate (Span 60) as a surfactant, light neutral oil as a continuous phase, and the aqueous solutions of <b>borax</b> <b>decahydrate</b> (Na 2 B 4 O 7 · 10 H 2 O) and zinc nitrate (Zn(NO 3) 2 · 6 H 2 O) as the dispersed phases. The produced particles were zinc borate crystals having both rod-like and spherical morphologies, and the diameters of spherical particles were changing between 20 and 30 nm. FTIR spectra of the obtained particles showed the characteristic peaks of trihedral borate (B(3) -O) and tetrahedral borate (B(4) -O) {{groups as well as}} the specific peaks of the sorbitan monostearate. TG showed 30. 42 % and 22. 08 % mass loss at 600 °C for the samples prepared by inverse emulsion and precipitation techniques, respectively. The endothermic peak at 50 °C is observed due to the melting of sorbitan monostearate and the heat of melting is evaluated as - 3. 50 J/g. Tribological studies revealed that sorbitan monostearate not only outperformed as a dispersing agent of inorganic particles, but also it proved to be an anti-wear agent. Zinc borate produced by precipitation decreased the wear scar diameter from 1. 402 to 0. 639 mm and the friction coefficient from 0. 099 to 0. 064. The inverse emulsion was effective in decreasing wear scar diameter and the friction coefficient by lowering them to 0. 596 and 0. 089 mm, respectively.

40|$|Many steroid hormones can be {{considered}} as potential biomarkers and their determination in body fluids can create opportunities for the rapid diagnosis of many diseases and disorders of the human body. Most existing methods for the determination of steroids are usually time- and labor-consuming and quite costly. Therefore, the aim of analytical laboratories is to develop a new, relatively low-cost and rapid implementation methodology for their determination in biological samples. Due {{to the fact that there}} is little literature data on concentrations of steroid hormones in urine samples, we have made attempts at the electrophoretic determination of these compounds. For this purpose, an extraction procedure for the optimized separation and simultaneous determination of seven steroid hormones in urine samples has been investigated. The isolation of analytes from biological samples was performed by liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) with dichloromethane and compared to solid phase extraction (SPE) with C 18 and hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) columns. To separate all the analytes a micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MECK) technique was employed. For full separation of all the analytes a running buffer (pH 9. 2), composed of 10 mM sodium tetraborate <b>decahydrate</b> (<b>borax),</b> 50 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 10 % methanol was selected. The methodology developed in this work for the determination of steroid hormones meets all the requirements of analytical methods. The applicability of the method has been confirmed for the analysis of urine samples collected from volunteers—both men and women (students, amateur bodybuilders, using and not applying steroid doping). The data obtained during this work can be successfully used for further research on the determination of steroid hormones in urine samples...|$|R
40|$|Since {{many years}} {{regional}} and national crystal growing competitions are successfully organized for pupils {{in countries such as}} Australia, Belgium, Canada, England, France and Singapore, and for sure in many schools on a more local basis. For most competitions pupils have to grow single crystals in the class room during a limited period of time (e. g. four weeks) of a limited amount of starting material provided by the organizers. Submitted single crystals are then judged by a jury based on the weight {{and the quality of the}} crystal. Typical compounds used as starting materials for such competitions are alum (aluminium potassium sulphate dodecahydrate), copper (II) sulphate pentahydrate, <b>borax</b> (sodium tetraborate <b>decahydrate),</b> ammonium iron (II) sulphate hexahydrate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate and ammonium magnesium sulphate hexahydrate. To celebrate the International Year of Crystallography a small IUCr working group of coordinators of current crystal growing competitions took the initiative to stimulate as many countries as possible to organize a regional or national crystal growing competition. To facilitate this, the IUCr offers all possible support for newcomers in the form of a time line, protocols and suggestions for judging and prize awarding. This information is available on the IYCr website www. iycr 2014. org/participate/crystal-growing-competition, together with a brand new animated video 'How to grow a single crystal - with Johanna' illustrating the protocol. With the celebrations of the International Year of Crystallography in mind the lead partners IUCr and UNESCO organize also a world-wide crystal growing competition. The aim of this competition is that participants grow their own crystals (whether involved in a regional/national competition or not) and convey their experience through a short video or essay. A panel of judges will evaluate the entries using criteria such as creativity, esthetic value, description of working plan and experimental work, clarity of explanations and scientific background. For countries were no crystallographers can take the lead to initiate a competition in 2014 the network of UNESCO schools will be used, an initiative which will start in September 2014. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Borate {{deposits}} {{are often}} important constituents of economic non - marine evaporates. They produce under arid climatic conditions in playa lakes (Floyd et al., 1998). In the south – western {{parts of the}} Kerman province, such as the Khatoonabad area (east {{of the city of}} Shahr –e –Babak) and Robat – Marvast basin (west of Shahr – e – Babak), there are several borate deposits. They can be seen mainly in Sanandaj – Sirjan depressions and they occur as borate bearing nodules beneath a thin layer of soil. In general, boron considerably reduces the thermal expansion of glass, provides good resistance to vibration, high temperatures and thermal shock, and improves its toughness, strength, chemical resistance and durability. It also greatly reduces the viscosity of the glass melt. These features, and others, allow it to form superior glass for many industrial and specialty applications (Garrett, 1998). In the past, the ancient residents used them as co-melting matters. Ulexite which is frequently found in the Khatoonabad playa (at 30 km South East of Shahr Babak) have Jewel properties (Ghaedi et al., 2014). Materials and methods After reviewing and Library Studies, geological field studies on the borate deposits were carried out from Shahr – e – Babak Playa. In order to take better samples, several pits were excavated with a depth of 30 cm to 1 meter so that borate minerals became apparent. X-ray diffraction analysis (IMIDRO, Karaj), and ICP AES (ALS CHEMEX, Canada) methods were carried out on representative samples taken from the studied area. Discussion Field observations show that in the studied areas, borate bearing basins are fed by rivers which have originated from Sanandaj – Sirjan metamorphic rocks, Nain – Baft colored mélanges and igneous rocks of Urumieh – Dokhtar magmatic belt. Borate minerals also occur in fibrous aggregates and massive forms. Mineralogy XRD results show that the studied borate minerals mainly belong to the hydrated borates and contain ulexite, borax, gowerite, sassolite and inyoite. Geochemichal data indicate that the boron is the dominant constituent in the studied playa. Borate minerals are divided into two groups of hydrated and non-hydrated borate category (Palache et al., 1952.; Garrett, 1998). Both hydrated and non-hydrated borate minerals have been formed in the Shahr-e-Babak playa. Hydrated borate in the study areas: Hydrated borates are those borates in which water molecules are involved (Garrett, 1998). In the studied area, the hydrated borate minerals include: Borax, Ulexite, Inyoite, Gowerite. Non-hydrated borate in the study areas: In the Shahr-e-Babak playa, Sassolite non-hydrated borate minerals are abundant. According to the XRD analyses performed on samples from the study areas, the hydrated borate minerals are more important minerals. The main economic valuable minerals include: 1 - Ulexite (NaCaB 5 O 9. 8 H 2 O) : Crystal Data: Triclinic. Point Group: 1 (Ghose et al., 1978). In the Shar – e - Babak playa, ulexite occurs as deposits with massive, cauliflower-like nodules and fibrous textures. 2 - Borax (Na 2 B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 • 8 H 2 O) : Crystal Data: Monoclinic. Point Group: 2 /m. Crystals are commonly short to long prismatic [001] (Levy and Lisensky, 1978). In the studied borate samples, it can be found in association with the other borate minerals, and often occurs in the form of salt marsh. 3 - Gowerite (CaB 6 O 8 (OH) 4 • 3 H 2 O) : Crystal Data: Monoclinic. Point Group: 2 /m (Erd et al., 1959). In the Khatoonabad samples, it was found as prismatic and spherical crystals along with ulexite. 4 - Inyoite (CaB 3 O 3 (OH) 5 • 4 H 2 O) : Crystal Data: Monoclinic. Point Group: 2 /m (Christ, 1953). This mineral has been detected in the studied area by XRD. Sassolite (H 3 BO 3) : Crystal Data: Triclinic. Point Group: 1 and as scaly pseudohexagonal crystals (Allen and Kramer, 1957). This mineral is found frequently in the Marvast Playa. Geochemistry Geochemical data indicate that in the studied playa, boron is very abundant. Good correlation between the elements, such as B and Ca confirms the formation of Calcium bearing borate mineral in the studied areas. Origin Field observations show that in the studied areas, borate bearing basins are fed by rivers which have originated from the Sanandaj – Sirjan metamorphic rocks, Nain – Baft colored mélanges and igneous rocks of the Urumieh – Dokhtar magmatic belt. Result The XRD results show that the studied borate minerals mainly are hydrated ones and contain ulexite, borax, gowerite, sassolite and inyoite. Geochemichal data confirm the frequency of boron in the playa. Good correlation between the elements such as B and Ca verifies the formation of Calcium bearing borate mineral in the studied areas.
