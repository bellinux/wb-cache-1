5|$|Hōshō was {{slightly}} damaged {{by a single}} <b>bomb</b> <b>or</b> aerial rocket hit when the Allies attacked Kure again in July 1945. Information is scarce {{on the extent of}} the ship's involvement in the action, but it appears the carrier's participation was minimal, as it embarked no aircraft at the time. Hōshō was repaired within 15 days, but the termination of hostilities in September 1945 found the carrier still docked at Kure.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was capable of}} performing dive bombing, and could be fitted with a single <b>bomb</b> <b>or</b> depth charge on a hardpoint under each wing for the mission, or for anti-submarine warfare. Gun armament consisted of two M2 Browning machine guns, one mounted in a fixed position firing forwards through the propeller using synchronizer gear, while the other was in a flexible position in the observer's cockpit for rear defense.|$|E
5|$|The {{fuselage}} bomb bay used four bomb racks, {{in later}} versions eight modular standard bomb racks designed to carry one SC 250kg (550lb) <b>bomb</b> <b>or</b> four SC 50kg (110lb) bombs each in nose up orientation. These modular standard bomb racks were a common feature {{on the first}} generation of Luftwaffe bombers, but it turned out that they limited the ordnance selection to bombs of only two sizes. These racks were abandoned in later designs.|$|E

5|$|Security {{measures}} included Turkish war {{ships and}} Turkish commandos in rubber boats patrolling the Bosporus, AWACS surveillance planes and F-16 warplanes circling {{above the city}} in order to monitor a no-fly zone over the city, and the assignment of 23,000 to 24,000 police officers, supported by police helicopters and armoured vehicles. The Bosphorus Strait was also closed to oil tankers, the underground rail system was suspended and whole city districts were sealed off. Nevertheless, a small <b>bomb</b> <b>or</b> explosive devise blew up on an empty Turkish Airlines plane on June 29 as workers were cleaning it at the main Istanbul airport. Three of the workers were slightly injured.|$|E
5|$|The F-20 did, however, {{have several}} {{problems}} inherent to its small size. The low-mounted wing meant {{that there was}} limited ground clearance, and {{the position of the}} landing gear meant loads had to be positioned towards the outer ends of the wings. This limited hard point weights to 1,000lb (454kg). A single hard point under the fuselage could carry more, a single Mk 84 2,000 lbs <b>bomb</b> <b>or</b> up to five Mk 82 500 lbs bombs. Additionally, although the wing profiling improved lift at higher angles of attack (AoA) while maneuvering, it did not improve cruise lift performance at normal AoA. This did not present a problem in the fighter role, but did severely reduce its payload/range figures compared to similar aircraft like the F-16.|$|E
5|$|The game's ending changes {{depending}} on whether the player has a radio beacon to call for extraction, and when the nuclear device is set to explode. Forgetting to set the <b>bomb,</b> <b>or</b> setting it to explode at any time past the awakening of the dreaming god, results in Earth's destruction. The device's detonation before the player reaches a minimum safe distance results in a pyrrhic victory. The most favorable endings are achieved by leaving the pyramid with a beacon for evacuation at least twenty game minutes before the device is set to go off; if the game ends with enough time for the player to escape on foot, the player survives without a beacon.|$|E
25|$|In early news accounts, pure fission {{weapons were}} called atomic <b>bombs</b> <b>or</b> A-bombs, a misnomer since the energy comes {{only from the}} nucleus of the atom. Weapons {{involving}} fusion were called hydrogen <b>bombs</b> <b>or</b> H-bombs, also a misnomer since their energy comes mostly from fission. Practitioners favored the terms nuclear and thermonuclear, respectively.|$|R

5|$|ZAPU members {{attempted}} to <b>bomb</b> <b>or</b> burn down {{the houses of}} blacks who joined or supported white-led political parties, {{as well as the}} churches they attended. Rival nationalists also used violence against each other as they jostled for prominence. In an attempt to restore confidence in the government and end the political intimidation, Smith cracked down hard on the militant nationalists, arresting political agitators in the townships for criminal offences and jailing ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo in Gonakudzingwa Restriction Camp, a remote detention unit in the country's south-east. The British government, worried that Southern Rhodesia might issue a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) rather than continue with negotiations, placed troops in Aden on alert.|$|E
5|$|Several major {{weaknesses}} in Akagis design were not rectified. Akagis aviation fuel tanks were incorporated {{directly into the}} structure of the carrier, meaning that shocks to the ship, such as those caused by <b>bomb</b> <b>or</b> shell hits, would be transmitted directly to the tanks, resulting in cracks or leaks. Also, the fully enclosed structure of the new hangar decks made firefighting difficult, at least in part because fuel vapors could accumulate in the hangars. Adding to the danger was the requirement of the Japanese carrier doctrine that aircraft be serviced, fueled, and armed whenever possible on the hangar decks rather than on the flight deck. Furthermore, the carrier's hangar and flight decks carried little armor protection, and there was no redundancy in the ship's fire-extinguishing systems. These weaknesses would later be crucial factors in the loss of the ship.|$|E
5|$|XXI Bomber Command {{arrived on}} Saipan on October 12, 1944, {{and from the}} start Hansell was beset {{by a host of}} serious command problems, the worst of which were {{continued}} teething problems with the B-29, tardy delivery of aircraft, aircrews untrained in high altitude formation flying, primitive airfield conditions, lack of an air service command for logistical support, no repair depots, a total absence of target intelligence, stubborn internal resistance to daylight operations by his sole combat wing, subordinates in the XXI Bomber Command who lobbied for his removal, and Hansell’s inferiority in rank in dealing with other AAF commanders in the theater. Furthermore, Hansell was soon prohibited from flying combat missions with his command, possibly because of limited knowledge of the atomic <b>bomb</b> <b>or</b> the perception that he knew the existence of Ultra.|$|E

25|$|Further {{examination}} of the airplane structure, seats, and other interior components found no damage typically associated with a high-energy explosion of a <b>bomb</b> <b>or</b> missile warhead ("severe pitting, cratering, petalling, or hot gas washing"). This included the pieces on which trace amounts of explosives were found. Of the 5 percent of the fuselage that was not recovered, none of the missing areas were large enough to have covered all the damage {{that would have been}} caused by the detonation of a <b>bomb</b> <b>or</b> missile. None of the victims' remains showed any evidence of injuries that could have been caused by high-energy explosives.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{its main}} mission, the G.1 could be {{configured}} for ground attack and light bombing missions (it could carry a bomb load of one 400kg/882lb <b>bomb</b> <b>or</b> combinations of two 200kg/441lb or 10 26kg/57lb bombs).|$|E

25|$|The F-111 {{featured}} {{an internal}} weapons bay that could carry bombs, a removable 20mm M61 cannon, or auxiliary fuel tanks. For bombs, the bay could hold two 750lb (340kg) M117 conventional bombs, one nuclear <b>bomb</b> <b>or</b> practice bombs. The F-111B for the US Navy was to carry two AIM-54 Phoenix long-range air-to-air missiles in the bay. The cannon {{had a large}} 2,084-round ammunition tank, and its muzzle was covered by a fairing; however, it was rarely fitted on F-111s.|$|E

25|$|With {{the advent}} of {{precision}} guided munitions that can be directed onto a specific target, it may be reasonable to use air attack against isolated command posts or other high-value facilities away from civilian areas. The combination of highly accurate, small weapons such as the Small Diameter <b>Bomb,</b> <b>or</b> even bombs without explosive filler, may be a wise way to attack specific, well-identified and difficult to reach targets. The skills necessary for identifying the target and guiding weapons to it, however, may not be something HN personnel have the experience to do.|$|E
25|$|Fackenheim's {{affirmation}} of his Jewish heritage, although embraced by many other Holocaust survivors, {{was by no}} means universal. Physicist Lise Meitner had been born and brought up Jewish. She rejected newspaper attempts to characterize her as a Jew following the bombing of Hiroshima when the press learned that she had been the first scientist to recognize nuclear fission. Decades before Hitler rose to power she had become a Lutheran. Although the Nazis stole her savings and ruined her career she refused to work on the <b>bomb</b> <b>or</b> let Hitler define her identity.|$|E
