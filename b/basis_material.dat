The imaging system is the XVI CBCT system on Elekta Synergy linac. Projection data were acquired with {{the high and low}} energy X-ray, respectively, to set up a <b>basis</b> <b>material</b> decomposition model. Virtual phantom simulation and phantoms experiments were carried out for quantitative evaluation of the method. Phantoms were also scanned twice with the high and low energy X-ray, respectively. The data were decomposed into projections of the two <b>basis</b> <b>material</b> coefficients according to the model set up earlier. The two sets of decomposed projections were used to reconstruct CBCT images of the <b>basis</b> <b>material</b> coefficients. Then, the images of electron densities were calculated with these CBCT images. Results. The difference between the calculated and theoretical values was within 2 % and the correlation coefficient of them was about 1. 0. The dual energy imaging method obtained more accurate electron density values and reduced the beam hardening artifacts obviously. Conclusion. A novel dual energy CBCT imaging method to calculate the electron densities was developed. It can acquire more accurate values and provide a platform potentially for dose calculation...|$|E

40|$|Dual energy CT (DECT) enhances tissue {{characterization}} {{because it}} can produce images of <b>basis</b> <b>materials</b> such as soft-tissue and bone. DECT is of great interest in applications to medical imaging, security inspection and nondestructive testing. Theoretically, two materials with different linear attenuation coefficients can be accurately reconstructed using DECT technique. However, the ability to reconstruct three or more <b>basis</b> <b>materials</b> is clinically and industrially important. Under the assumption that there are at most three materials in each pixel, {{there are a few}} methods that estimate multiple material images from DECT measurements by enforcing sum-to-one and a box constraint ([0 1]) derived from both the volume and mass conservation assumption. The recently proposed image-domain multi-material decomposition (MMD) method introduces edge-preserving regularization for each material image which neglects the relations among material images, and enforced the assumption that there are at most three materials in each pixel using a time-consuming loop over all possible material-triplet in each iteration of optimizing its cost function. We propose a new image-domain MMD method for DECT that considers the prior information that different material images have common edges and encourages sparsity of material composition in each pixel using regularization...|$|R
40|$|The dual or multi-energy x-ray {{technique}} facilitates {{to generate}} tissue-selective images, by exploiting tissue-specific energy dependence of x-ray attenuation. An abnormal breast {{is considered to}} be a mixture of adipose, glandular, and abnormal tissues, but three tissues cannot be selectively decomposed because the total attenuation of a tissue is represented by only two attenuation basis functions at diagnostic energy range. This paper presents a novel method to selectively represent abnormal breast tissue, using polyenergetic multi-energy x-ray. We show that an abnormal tissue can be revealed from the total thickness map, which is virtually constructed by assuming a healthy and compressed breast. Specifically, regression analysis is first performed using the multi-energy images of the prepared calibration phantom that consists of two <b>basis</b> <b>materials.</b> Total thickness map is then constructed by linearly combining thickness maps of <b>basis</b> <b>materials,</b> where the optimal weights for combination are determined so that the uniformity of total breast thickness is maximized.

40|$|Purpose. Dual-energy CT imaging {{tends to}} suffer from much lower {{signal-to-noise}} ratio than single-energy CT. In this paper, we propose an improved anticorrelated noise reduction (ACNR) method without causing cross-contamination artifacts. Methods. The proposed algorithm diffuses both <b>basis</b> <b>material</b> density images (e. g., water and iodine) {{at the same time}} using a novel correlated diffusion algorithm. The algorithm has been compared to the original ACNR algorithm in a contrast-enhanced, IRB-approved patient study. Material density accuracy and noise reduction are quantitatively evaluated by the percent density error and the percent noise reduction. Results. Both algorithms have significantly reduced the noises of <b>basis</b> <b>material</b> density images in all cases. The average percent noise reduction is 69. 3 % and 66. 5 % with the ACNR algorithm and the proposed algorithm, respectively. However, the ACNR algorithm alters the original material density by an average of 13 % (or 2. 18 [*]mg/cc) with a maximum of 58. 7 % (or 8. 97 [*]mg/cc) in this study. This is evident in the water density images as massive cross-contaminations are seen in all five clinical cases. On the contrary, the proposed algorithm only changes the mean density by 2. 4 % (or 0. 69 [*]mg/cc) with a maximum of 7. 6 % (or 1. 31 [*]mg/cc). The cross-contamination artifacts are significantly minimized or absent with the proposed algorithm. Conclusion. The proposed algorithm can significantly reduce image noise present in <b>basis</b> <b>material</b> density images from dual-energy CT imaging, with minimized cross-contaminations compared to the ACNR algorithm...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The flat {{compression}} {{properties of}} corrugated sandwich structure {{are an important}} factor to evaluate their cushioning properties. At present, more research has been made on the mechanical properties in the cross direction (CD) and machine direction (MD), but less {{has been made in}} the flat compression direction. Selecting corrugated paperboards as samples, we analyzed the flat compression properties of the corrugated sandwich structure and explored the critical stress which is a key element for evaluating the cushioning properties based on theory and experiment. It is convenient to evaluate the cushioning properties and optimize the corrugated sandwich structure. Simplifying the corrugated structure into the struts, and referring to the bending theory of the standard beam theory, we explored the evaluating equation of the critical stress for corrugated sandwich structure by the bending moment and Euler formulas. The critical stress is in direct proportion to the elastic modulus and the thickness of the <b>basis</b> <b>material.</b> It is also closely related to the length of the corrugated cell-wall and the pasted width between the corrugated cell-wall and the linerboard. Changing the above parameters, we can change the compression resistance of the corrugated sandwich structure. The theoretical value of the critical stress of the corrugated sandwich structure is higher than the experimental value, since the mechanical properties are lost when the <b>basis</b> <b>material</b> is manufactured into corrugated sandwiches and corrugated boards. Therefore, the lost coefficient is introduced into the theoretic equation which can not only help optimize and design the corrugated sandwich structure, but also find application in optimized design of cushioning pads of corrugated sandwich structure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract X-ray {{computed}} tomography (CT) {{is a medical}} imaging modality that allows reconstruction of the internal stucture {{of the human body}} from a large number of x-ray attenuation measurements. In recent years, the development of spectral CT, in which the energy dependence of the x-ray attenuation coe-cient is utilized, has attracted considerable interest. This thesis is concerned with a spectral CT system based on a photon-counting silicon strip detector which is being developed in our group. A computer model for photon counting spectral CT was developed and used for simulating the proposed CT system as well as a laboratory CT setup designed for testing purposes. The simulations were used to compare the performance of two reconstruction methods for spectral CT, image-based energy weighting and <b>basis</b> <b>material</b> decomposition. The study shows that the two methods perform equally well when the number of x-ray photons in each measurement is high, while <b>basis</b> <b>material</b> decomposition performs signcantly worse than energy weighting for data with few photons in each measurement. Also included in the thesis is a simulation study of the detrimental eects of electronic noise and thresold variations on image quality. It is shown that a proposed electronic noise reduction of 20 % in the readout channels gives an improvement in mean   SDNR 2 over many channels of only 1. 8 %. In addition, a scheme for countering electronic noise contamination of the lowest energy bins due to threshold variations is discussed.

As a result, the method presented here is related to soft clustering tasks with a strategy for avoiding local minima.
