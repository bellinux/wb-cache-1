In particular the request referred that <b>black-mouth</b> <b>catshark</b> (Galeus melastomus) be excluded from the list and low fin gulper shark (Centrophorus lusitanicus) be included in the list. The rationale behind the former case responds to consider the species as only demersal and not illustrative of deep-sea habitats. The latter regards to landings in ICES area IX, where the landings of other morphologically very similar species such as gulper shark (Centrophorus squamosus) may have been underreported due to misidentification among both species. Concerning deep-sea sharks, the main commercial species are considered depleted and no directed fishing should take place. The Council agreed to fix TAC equal to zero since 2012, and, therefore, the content of the list of species of deep-sea sharks is deemed to be essential. ...|$|E
