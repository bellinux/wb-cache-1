The oxidative stability of RTE turkey rolls was improved by the dietary CLA treatment. Irradiation increased the production of acetaldehyde, 3 -methyl-buta-nal, 2 -methyl-butanal, and total volatiles in turkey rolls but had little effect on other aldehydes.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the use of sodium levulinate to prevent outgrowth of Listeria monocytogenes in refrigerated ready-to-eat (RTE) meat products. Turkey <b>breast</b> <b>roll</b> and bologna were formulated to contain 1 %, 2 %, or 3 % (w/w) sodium levulinate, 2 % sodium lactate, a 2 % combination of sodium lactate and sodium diacetate (1. 875 % sodium lactate and 0. 125 % sodium diacetate), or no antimicrobial (control). Samples of the RTE products were sliced, inoculated with 10 2 to 10 3 CFU/cm 2 of a 5 -strain cocktail of L. monocytogenes, vacuum packaged, and stored at refrigeration temperature for 0 to 12 wk. Counts reached 10 8 CFU/cm 2 on control turkey roll product after 8 wk, and over 10 7 CFU/cm 2 on control bologna after 12 wk. Addition of 2 % or more sodium levulinate to turkey roll and 1 % or more sodium levulinate to bologna completely prevented growth of L. monocytogenes during 12 wk of refrigerated storage. A consumer taste panel with pathogen-free samples found no differences in the overall liking among the preparations of turkey roll or among preparations of bologna. These results show that sodium levulinate {{is at least as}} effective at inhibiting outgrowth of L. monocytogenes in RTE meat products as the current industry standards of lactate or lactate and diacetate, and levulinate addition does not alter the overal lliking of the RTE meat products...|$|E
40|$|The D 10 -values of L. monocytogenes in <b>breast</b> <b>rolls</b> and hams were 0. 52 and 0. 47 kGy, respectively.

Sliced turkey <b>breast</b> <b>rolls</b> were artificially inoculated with ~ 10 6 CFU/cm 2 five-strain- L. monocytogenes cocktails, then vacuum-packaged and irradiated at 0, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0 or 2. 5 kGy. D 10 values for <b>breast</b> <b>rolls</b> with various additive treatments ranged from 0. 56 to 0. 58 kGy. Adding PB (0. 1 %) or SL (2 %) in turkey rolls failed to prevent L. monocytogenes from growing during refrigerated storage.

Irradiating turkey rolls, which were added with PB+SL or SL+SDA, at 1. 0 kGy was effective in suppressing the growth of L. monocytogenes for about six weeks when stored at 4 °C.

In conclusion, a combination of physical and chemical antimicrobial intervention offers better inhibitory effect on the growth of L. monocytogenes in RTE turkey breast than that of single intervention.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigated the}} effect of irradiation and antimicrobials on the quality and survival of L. monocytogenes, a significant safety concern, in RTE turkey meat products. Results showed that dietary vitamin E was effective in {{reducing the number of}} L. monocytogenes carried by live turkeys, a source of L. monocytogenes contamination in RTE products. Irradiation was very effective in eliminating L. monocytogenes in both turkey <b>breast</b> <b>rolls</b> and hams. However, irradiation also caused quality changes. A dose of 2. 0 kGy irradiation produced significant off-odor, mainly sulfur-related odor/flavor, in vacuum-packaged RTE turkey ham and rolls. Thus, only low dose irradiation is recommended. However, low-dose irradiation allowed some L. monocytogenes to survive during irradiation. Antimicrobial agents were formulated into RTE turkey rolls and hams as an additional hurdle to suppress the growth of L. monocytogenes that survived low-dose irradiation. Antimicrobials, including 0. 1 % potassium benzoate (PB), 2 % sodium lactate (SL), and 0. 1 % sodium diacetate (SDA) were used singly or in combinations to assess their effectiveness in inhibiting the growth of L. monocytogenes in RTE meat products following low-dose irradiation. Results showed that for RTE turkey meats formulated with 0. 1 % PB + 2 % SL or 2 % SL + 0. 1 % SDA, 1. 0 kGy irradiation was effective in suppressing the growth of L. monocytogenes for about six weeks at 4 °C, and 2. 0 kGy irradiation was listeriostatic during a 42 -day refrigerated storage period. For RTE turkey meat formulated with three antimicrobials in combination, 0. 1 % PB + 2 % SL + 0. 1 % SDA, 1. 0 kGy irradiation was listeriostatic. Including 2 % SL in formulation, however, slightly affected the texture and color values of turkey <b>breast</b> <b>rolls,</b> and the addition of PB in RTE turkey meats produced a high amount of benzene after irradiation. Considering their antilistenal activity and their effects on quality, including 2 % SL plus 0. 1 % SDA in formulation in combination with 1. 0 - or 2. 0 kGy-irradiation was a promising technology {{to ensure the safety of}} RTE turkey ham and <b>breast</b> <b>rolls</b> from L. monocytogenes...|$|R

25|$|Greek pottery also {{provides}} {{an insight into}} the daily life of prostitutes. Their representation can generally be grouped into four categories: banquet scenes, sexual activities, toilet scenes and scenes depicting maltreatment. In the toilet scenes the prostitute frequently has a less than perfect body; sagging <b>breasts,</b> <b>rolls</b> of flesh, etc. There is a kylix showing a prostitute urinating into a chamber pot. In the representation of sexual acts, {{the presence of a}} prostitute is often indicated by a purse, which underscores the financial nature of the relationship. The position most frequently shown is the leapfrog—or sodomy; these two positions being difficult to visually distinguish. The woman is frequently folded in two with her hands flat on the ground. Sodomy was considered degrading for an adult and it seems that the leapfrog position (as opposed to the missionary position) was considered less gratifying for the woman. Finally, a number of vases represent scenes of abuse, where the prostitute is threatened with a stick or sandal, and forced to perform acts considered by the Greeks to be degrading: fellatio, sodomy or sex with two partners.|$|R

In {{a similar fashion}} to which obesity traumatizes the dermis, the increased load on the abdominal fascia compromis-es its mechanical strength and integrity.

This report investigates the use of SERI to provide support and to enhance fascial integrity in a patient undergoing circumferential body lift.

She had fullness in the anterior axilla, lat-eral <b>breast</b> <b>rolls,</b> significant excess skin and fullness in the abdomen and trunk circumferentially, and ab-dominal wall laxity. During examination, stretch marks and stria were noted. After reviewing several surgical options with her, a plan was developed to perform a circumferential body lift with suction-assisted and ultrasound-assisted lipectomy. It was, therefore, thought that the use of SERI might provide additional support and integrity to the abdominal wall plication and help to maintain the patient’s postoperative contours. This option was discussed with the patient, and she provided oral and written informed consent.

40|$|Background. The {{radioguided}} localization of occult <b>breast</b> lesions (<b>ROLL)</b> technique often utilizes iodinated {{radiographic contrast}} {{to assure that}} the local injection of (99 m) Tc-MAA corresponds to the location of the lesion under investigation. However, for this application, this contrast has several shortcomings. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the safety, effectiveness and technical feasibility of the use of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as radiological contrast and tissue marker in ROLL. Materials and methods. The safety assessment was performed by the acute toxicity study in Wistar rats (n = 50). The radiological analysis of breast tissue (n = 32) from patients undergoing reductive mammoplasty was used to verify the effectiveness of PDMS as contrast media. The technical feasibility was evaluated through the scintigraphic and histologic analysis. Results. We found no toxic effects of PDMS for this use during the observational period. It has been demonstrated in human breast tissue that the average diameter of the tissue marked by PDMS was lower than when marked by the contrast medium (p < 0. 001). PDMS did not interfere with the scintigraphic uptake (p = 0. 528) and there was no injury in histological processing of samples. Conclusions.
