So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E
25|$|However, in cities, {{where the}} {{population}} {{tends to be}} much higher, informal interactions between ethnic groups might {{not be sufficient to}} prevent violence. This is <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> many more links to connect everyone and therefore it is much more difficult to form and strengthen inter-ethnic ties. In cities, formal inter-ethnic associations like trade unions, business associations and professional organizations are more effective in encouraging inter-ethnic interactions that could prevent ethnic violence in the future. These organizations force ethnic groups to come together based on shared economic interests that overcomes any pre-existing ethnic differences. For example, inter-ethnic business organizations serve to connect the business interests of different ethnic groups which would increase their desire to maintain ethnic harmony. Any ethnic tension or outbreak of violence will go against their economic interests and therefore, over time, the salience of ethnic identity diminishes.|$|E

After filming was finished, Dassin showed the film to Auric once with music and once without. Afterward, Auric agreed the scene should be unscored.|$|E

Etymologies, often very far-fetched, form the subject of just one of the encyclopedia's twenty books (Book X), but perceived linguistic similarities permeate the work. An idea of the quality of Isidore's etymological knowledge is given by Peter Jones: [...] "Now we know most of his derivations are total nonsense (eg, he derives baculus, 'walking-stick', from Bacchus, god of drink, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> one to walk straight after sinking a few)".|$|E

In mid-November 2013 Pugh stated his belief that Bournemouth had made a [...] "decent start" [...] to the season; by this point he had scored 4 goals from 16 appearances. He believed his playing intelligence improved by playing against more attack-minded full backs in the Championship, saying that [...] "They are still quick to react and {{you have got to}} use your brain {{a little bit more than}} in League One. It's developed me as a player <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to learn how to perform in different situations against different players". Pugh made 45 appearances and scored 5 goals in 2013–14 as Bournemouth finished in 10th place in the Championship, which at the time was the highest league ranking in the club's history.|$|E

500|$|Digital Spy's Lewis Corner {{gave the}} song a four (out of five)-star rating, and wrote that its {{production}} {{was of a}} [...] "summer anthem level". Corner said the track felt [...] "slightly lighter" [...] than Azalea's previous releases, adding: [...] "... but if it means she crosses over into superstardom territory, it's a job well done". While Robert Copsey of the same website believed that it [...] "felt like a somewhat needless moment of pop frivolity". Complex reviewers were also divided; Brian Josephs considered the track a [...] " [...] club banger", but David Drake criticized Azalea's [...] "nimble rapping and forced accent". According to Drake, [...] " [...] {{is the kind of}} thing that might work in the UK, where a digitally-animated frog once had a No. 1 hit with a cover of the theme to Beverly Hills Cop, but this will probably be a long shot at getting stateside club play". John Robinson of The Guardian felt it was [...] "second-division" [...] and [...] "sheeeeeit". Karen Lawler of Blues & Soul opined that it recalled [...] "a lost track" [...] from Miley Cyrus' 2013 album, Bangerz, and dismissed its [...] "nod" [...] to 2 Unlimited as [...] "cringe worthy". While Clash called [...] "Bounce" [...] an inferior version of [...] "No Limit" [...] and [...] "criminal in every way", and opined that it lacked tune; [...] "No Auto-Tune, though, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> a tune to Auto".|$|E

6000|$|Of general precepts {{he never}} tired; one series of them {{followed}} another. To us {{many of them}} may seem commonplace; but we should reflect that the election of representatives was an amazing novelty in France, and Condorcet knew men well enough {{to be aware of}} the hazards of political inexperience. Beware of choosing a clever knave, he said, because he will follow his own interest and not yours; but at the same time beware of choosing a man for no better reason than that he is honest, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> ability quite as much as you need probity. Do not choose a man who has ever taken sides against the liberty of any portion of mankind; nor one whose principles were never known until he found out that he wanted your votes. Be careful not to mistake heat of head for heat of soul; because what you want is not heat but force, not violence but steadfastness. Be careful, too, to separate a man's actions from the accidents of his life; for one may be the enemy or the victim of a tyrant without being the friend of liberty. Do not be carried away by a candidate's solicitations; but at the same time, make allowance for the existing effervescence of spirits. Prefer those who have decided opinions to those who are always inventing plans of conciliation; those who are zealous for the rights of man to those who only profess pity for the misfortunes of the people; those who speak of justice and reason, to those who speak of political interests and of the prosperity of commerce. Distrust those who appeal to sentiment in matters that can be decided by reason; prefer light to eloquence; and pass over those who declare themselves ready to die for liberty, in favour of those who know in what liberty consists.[22] ...|$|E

I can awe you with my silence; but my silence is only my just humility, and your gain. [...] How dare I pretend to tell you secrets which He who made me knows alone? I am but inanimate matter; why ask of me things which belong to living spirit? In God I live and move, and have my being; I know not how, any more than you know.
