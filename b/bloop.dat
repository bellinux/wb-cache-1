5|$|The Yankees {{scored the}} first {{run of the}} game in the third inning on a Babe Ruth solo home run into the right field bleachers. In the {{following}} half inning, the Cardinals came back to take a 3–1 lead over the Yankees. Jim Bottomley lined a one-out single into left field to start the Cardinals' fourth inning rally. Les Bell just barely made it to first base after shortstop Mark Koenig accidentally kicked the ball while trying to field it. With runners at first and second base, Chick Hafey hit a <b>bloop</b> single into left field, which loaded up the bases for catcher Bob O'Farrell. This time, left fielder Bob Meusel made an error by dropping O'Farrell's fly ball, so Bottomley scored to tie the game, and the bases remained loaded. Tommy Thevenow followed with a two-run single to right fielder Ruth. Hoyt struck out the next batter, and Wattie Holm hit into a force play at second base. All three runs in the inning were charged as unearned on Hoyt, due to the two Yankee errors.|$|E
25|$|Highlights of Hubbs playing {{defense at}} shortstop were {{captured}} on film. The video includes a play where Hubbs {{ran from the}} shortstop position {{to back up the}} second baseman and caught a <b>bloop</b> fly into short right field.|$|E
25|$|September 19, 1945: The Tigers {{were shut}} out by Bob Feller, 2–0. Jimmy Outlaw had the only hit off Feller, a <b>bloop</b> {{single in the}} 5th inning. The Senators did not play, and the Tigers' lead is 1 game.|$|E

5000|$|The band itself {{describes}} its {{style as}} [...] "The Who without the deafness. Matchbox Twenty without the cross over-cheddar. Counting Crows without the Bar band factor. Wilco with hope. Radiohead without the computerized sorrow and bleeps and <b>bloops.</b> The Police without the 80s. Maroon 5 without Stevie Wonder." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jeff Benjamin of Billboard {{praised the}} title track, [...] "Everybody", stating, [...] "Shinee crams in loads of dubstep {{alongside}} bleeps, <b>bloops,</b> build-ups and breakdowns. The electronic overload is topped off with sweet boy band harmonies, {{resulting in an}} easy-to-digest electro-pop track". The choreography of the song however was the highlight for the columnist stating it's [...] "the most impressive point of Shinee's comeback".|$|R
25|$|On September 1, {{his first}} day back off the DL, Sweeney pinch-hit {{in the bottom of}} the 9th and hit a <b>bloop</b> base hit that broke up Minnesota Twins {{starting}} pitcher Scott Baker's no-hitter. Baker had gone eight perfect innings before he walked Royals catcher John Buck at the beginning of the ninth. With two outs to go, Royals manager Buddy Bell pinch-hit Sweeney for Tony Peña Jr. and Sweeney ended the no-hitter.|$|E
25|$|Boston took {{an early}} 2–0 lead against the NL West leading Giants but {{surrendered}} three {{runs in the}} fourth and fifth inning. In the seventh inning, the Red Sox tied the game and it went into extra innings. With the bases loaded and one out, two runs scored on a Xander Bogaerts <b>bloop</b> single {{in the top of the}} tenth which was the difference in the game. In game two, David Price pitched a complete game, allowing two runs on three hits. The only run for the Red Sox came off the bat of Chris Young with a solo shot in the fourth. Boston lost or split four series in a row for the first time since July/August 2014, when they dropped five consecutive series against the Blue Jays twice, Rays, Yankees and Cardinals.|$|E
25|$|The Red Sox {{went to the}} World Series to {{face the}} St. Louis Cardinals. In the opener at Fenway Park, Red Sox pitcher José Santiago {{hit a home run}} off legendary Bob Gibson. But they lost 2–1. In the {{following}} game Jim Lonborg pitched a no-hitter until the 8th inning when Julián Javier hit a leadoff double. Carl Yastrzemski hit two home runs in a 5–0 victory. The Series then shifted to St. Louis. In the third game Cardinal Nelson Briles pitched a 5–2 victory, Reggie Smith homered for the Sox. In game 4 Gibson shut out Boston 6–0 in a complete game victory. Down 3 games to 1 the Red Sox had Jim Lonborg to start game five. He pitched a 3-hitter and catcher Elston Howard hit a <b>bloop</b> single that gave them the win. In game six at Fenway Park, Manager Dick Williams started rookie pitcher Gary Waslewski to start it in an 8–4 victory. In the 4th inning Carl Yastrzemski, Reggie Smith and Rico Petrocelli hit home runs. Rico also homered in the 2nd inning. In game 7 Gibson won against Lonborg 7–2 to end the season.|$|E
50|$|In the seventh, Jim Rice led off and <b>blooped</b> {{a double}} to right, but {{was thrown out}} by Dave Parker {{as he tried to}} stretch the hit into a triple. Lee Mazzilli, batting for Gary Matthews tied the score at 6-6 in the NL half of the eighth with an opposite-field solo homer off Jim Kern for the first-ever pinch-hit home run in MLB All-Star game history.|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, the {{narrative}} that <b>Bloop's</b> sound was animal in origin {{due to its}} variability fails {{to take into consideration}} the fact that these variations are also commonly seen in ice calving, variations which result from a sound source's own motion. As oceanographer Dr. Yunbo Xie explains, the alteration of waveforms from a detected sound [...] "can also be caused by so-called angular frequency dependent radiation patterns associated with antisymmetric mode motion of the ice cover." ...|$|R
50|$|Giants {{starting}} pitcher Russ Ortiz stifled the Mets early, {{and had a}} no-hitter entering the sixth inning. He was staked to a 2-0 lead thanks to RBI singles from Bobby Estalella and Marvin Benard. In the sixth, the Mets broke through. Rookie Timo Pérez, forced into action due to a Game 1 injury to starting right fielder Derek Bell, <b>blooped</b> a single over third base to score Mike Bordick and put the Mets on the scoreboard.|$|R
25|$|Game 5 {{began with}} the unconventional, soulful singing of the {{national}} anthem by José Feliciano, drawing boos from some Detroit fans. When the game got underway, the Cardinals immediately scored three runs {{in the first inning}} off Mickey Lolich. In the fifth inning, Lou Brock doubled, and the Cardinals had a chance to break the game open, but Brock tried to score from second base on a single to left field. Brock was out in a collision with Bill Freehan at home plate, as Willie Horton's throw hit Bill Freehan's glove on the fly, and Brock elected not to slide. Brock later remarked that he never slid because no one had ever tried to throw him out at home. In the 7th inning, the Cardinals led, 3–2. Mickey Lolich led off for the Tigers in the 7th inning with a <b>bloop</b> single, and the Tigers loaded the bases for Al Kaline to slap a single into right field, driving in two runs. Cash drove in another run, and the Tigers led, 5–3, which proved to be the final score. Mickey Lolich pitched his second complete game victory.|$|E
25|$|In the 2003 American League Division Series, the Red Sox rallied from a 0–2 series deficit {{against the}} Oakland Athletics {{to win the}} best-of-five series. In extra innings of game three at Fenway pinch hitter Trot Nixion belted a homer into the center field bleachers to give the Sox victory. Derek Lowe, who had become a starter after several years as a relief pitcher, {{returned}} to his former role to save Game 5, a 4–3 victory, by striking out the A's Terrence Long with the tying run on third base. The team then faced the New York Yankees in the 2003 American League Championship Series. In the deciding seventh game Boston took a 4–0 lead on home runs by Nixon and Kevin Millar. But two Giambi homers made it 4–2. Boston led 5–2 thanks to a shot by David Ortiz in the eighth inning, but Pedro Martínez, who was still pitching into the 8th inning, allowed three runs to tie the game, including a two-run <b>bloop</b> double by Jorge Posada. The Red Sox could not score off Mariano Rivera {{over the last three}} innings and eventually lost the game 6–5 when Yankee third baseman Aaron Boone hit a solo home run off Red Sox pitcher Tim Wakefield.|$|E
25|$|As Price {{pitched in}} the fourth game, the start in game 5 went to Marcus Stroman, who opposed Cole Hamels {{for the second time}} in the ALDS. Texas got out to a 1–0 lead quickly, scoring in the first inning. In the third inning, Shin-Soo Choo hit a solo home run, giving Texas a two-run lead. The Jays responded in the bottom of the third, with Jose Bautista {{doubling}} in Ben Revere. In the sixth inning, Edwin Encarnacion hit a home run to tie the game at 2–2. In the seventh inning, controversy arose when Russell Martin attempted to throw the ball back to pitcher Aaron Sanchez. The ball hit the bat of Shin-Soo Choo, and went toward third base. Rougned Odor, who was at third base, scored the go-ahead run on the play, though initially home plate umpire Dale Scott rules the ball dead. After a lengthy delay, which included Toronto fans throwing beer cans and plastic bottles onto the field, the call was upheld, and Texas took a 3–2 lead. Shortly afterward, Toronto manager John Gibbons informed the umpires that the team would play the rest of the game under protest. In the bottom half of the seventh inning, the Texas defence would commit three errors, which loaded the bases with no outs. After Ben Revere grounded out, Josh Donaldson tied the game with a <b>bloop</b> single to right field. With runners on first and third and two outs in the inning, Jose Bautista hit a go-ahead three-run home run to take a commanding 6–3 lead. Bautista flipped his bat after he scored the home run, which later became viral on social media. Roberto Osuna came on to close the game with a five-out save, becoming the second-youngest pitcher in MLB history to record a postseason save by sealing the 6–3 victory.|$|E
50|$|In {{the bottom}} of the tenth, Jerry Grote led off by <b>blooping</b> a double to left. Al Weis was {{intentionally}} walked, and Mets manager Gil Hodges sent J. C. Martin up to hit for Seaver. Martin laid down a sacrifice bunt, but Orioles reliever Pete Richert hit Martin in the wrist with his throw to first, and the ball went down the right field line. Rod Gaspar, running for Grote, came around to score the winning run.|$|R
5000|$|On 30 June 2009, Koromah {{released}} East London Is Back, a [...] "stunningly spartan Atari teenage riot of electro <b>bloops</b> and beeps". The song {{received much}} attention {{and was given}} support by national radio stations BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra. This {{paved the way for}} a mixtape, The Maxtape, released on 29 March 2010. It was a commercial success, selling out in the first few days. Shortly afterwards, Koromah performed at T In The Park 2010.|$|R
50|$|With {{first base}} now open and two runners in scoring position, Herzog then chose to walk Royals pinch-hitter Hal McRae {{to set up}} a {{potential}} double-play. With the bases loaded and one out, pinch-hitter Dane Iorg <b>blooped</b> a single to right field. Pinch runner Onix Concepción scored the tying run and Sundberg approached the plate with the winning run. Andy Van Slyke's throw was on the money, but Porter was unable to tag Sundberg before he slid home safely with the game-winning run.|$|R
500|$|<b>BLOOP</b> {{stands for}} [...] "Blooper of the Year", {{one of the}} This Year in Baseball Awards, which are voted on by the fans and {{sponsored}} by State Farm Insurance. Jason Michaels was the winner in 2004 for bobbling a home run over the center field wall at Citizens Bank Park.|$|E
500|$|Koufax {{made his}} major league debut on June 24, [...] against the Milwaukee Braves, with the Dodgers {{trailing}} 7–1 {{in the fifth}} inning. Johnny Logan, the first batter Koufax faced, hit a <b>bloop</b> single. Eddie Mathews bunted, and Koufax threw the ball into center field. Koufax walked Hank Aaron on four pitches to load the bases, then struck out Bobby Thomson on a full count.|$|E
500|$|Taylor Douthit led off Game 1 with {{a double}} to left, {{advanced}} to third on Southworth's slow grounder to second baseman Tony Lazzeri, stayed there on Hornsby's comebacker right to Pennock but came home on [...] "Sunny Jim" [...] Bottomley's <b>bloop</b> single for the first run of the Series. In the bottom half, Sherdel walked Earle Combs, Babe Ruth and Bob Meusel, to load the bases. Gehrig scored Combs with a fielder's choice grounder for his first World Series run batted in (RBI), reaching first ahead of the relay. The Cardinals and Yankees were tied 1–1 after the first inning.|$|E
50|$|Lauren from Stoney Roads said “It {{opens with}} a vocals-only melody that oozes with a rich, {{emotional}} senstivity. The atmosphere builds as the synth and airy vocal layers stagger their way in - but the bluesy ballad stops right there. The beats drops. The funk begins. And funky, it is. The groovy melody is seriously lush, with crooner Ben Woolner showing off an impressive falsetto and a sensual, husky voice. Synth bleeps and <b>bloops</b> fill the soundscape, creating a sort of futuristic pop-r&b tone.|$|R
25|$|Giants {{starting}} pitcher Russ Ortiz stifled the Mets early, {{and had a}} no-hitter entering the sixth inning. He was staked to a 2–0 lead thanks to two leadoff singles in the fourth off of Rick Reed, followed RBI singles from Bobby Estalella and Marvin Benard. In the sixth, the Mets broke through. After a walk and single, rookie Timo Pérez, forced into action due to a Game 1 injury to starting right fielder Derek Bell, <b>blooped</b> a single over third base to score Mike Bordick and put the Mets on the scoreboard.|$|R
50|$|The AL {{then came}} to bat {{in the eighth}} and mounted one last threat. Brian Downing led off with a single off Bruce Sutter and was sacrificed to second. Sutter walked Reggie Jackson {{intentionally}} and then struck out Bobby Grich. Graig Nettles then <b>blooped</b> a single to right, and Downing attempted to score, but once again the arm of Dave Parker claimed another victim. Parker fired a perfect strike to Carter, who blocked Downing from ever reaching the plate. This play, along with his earlier play on Rice, earned Parker the game's MVP award.|$|R
500|$|Miller {{made the}} Cardinals' Opening Day {{starting}} rotation for the 2013 season, following a spring training competition with Joe Kelly {{for the final}} spot in the rotation. He threw his first career shutout in a 3–0 win against the Colorado Rockies on May 10, 2013. After allowing a <b>bloop</b> single to Eric Young, Jr. to begin the match, Miller pitched {{the equivalent of a}} perfect game by retiring the next 27 batters in a row. He threw 113 pitches, 84 for strikes. He walked none, striking out a career-high 13, which tied the Cardinals' rookie record, also held by Dick Hughes and Scipio Spinks. [...] It was the closest a Cardinals' rookie came to throwing a no-hitter since Bud Smith performed the feat in 2001. His Game Score of 98 was the highest ever for a nine inning game thrown by a Cardinals pitcher. [...] Miller's season performance vaunted him as an early Rookie of the Year award favorite. He won the Pitching Performance of the Month award for May because of his one-hit game on May 10. He had a 2–1 win-loss record, walking only six and striking out 32 for the month, while leading the NL with a 1.82 ERA.|$|E
500|$|With Rivera's {{contract}} set {{to expire}} after 2001, the Yankees signed {{him to a}} four-year, $39.99million deal prior to the season, marking the first long-term contract of his career. In 2001, he was selected for the All-Star team for a third consecutive year. His final numbers included a 2.34ERA, a closer career-high innings pitched, and an MLB-leading 50saves in 57opportunities—his second time leading the league. His saves total that year surpassed Dave Righetti's 46 saves in 1986 for the most by a Yankee pitcher in a single season, and made him just the sixth MLB pitcher to reach 50saves in a single season. Rivera's performance earned him his second AL Rolaids Relief Man Award. Despite having what sportswriters deemed an [...] "aura of invincibility" [...] in the postseason, Rivera failed to close out the decisive Game 7 of the 2001 World Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks. In {{one of his most}} infamous moments, he blew a save {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning, in part due to his own throwing error, and he lost the Series later in the inning by allowing Luis Gonzalez's <b>bloop</b> single with the bases loaded to score the winning run. It was the first and only loss of Rivera's postseason career, and it snapped his record streak of 23consecutive postseason saves converted.|$|E
500|$|On July 31, 1942, Day set a Negro {{league record}} for strikeouts {{in a single}} game, {{striking}} out 18 batters from the Baltimore Elite Giants in a one-hit shoutout. The only hit manufactured against Day that outing was a <b>bloop</b> single to left field off the bat of [...] "Pee Wee" [...] Butts. In the 1942 East-West All-Star Game, with runners threatening in the seventh inning, Day entered in relief to strike out seven batters, the most recorded by a pitcher in an East-West All-Star appearance. Although the Newark Eagles failed to secure the Negro National League pennant that season, Day still participated in the Negro League World Series thanks to an odd transaction. After dropping the first three games, the Homestead Grays acquired Day on loan from the Eagles. He bested his rival Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Monarchs in a 4–1 Game Four victory. In response to the upset, the Pittsburgh Courier, {{one of the most}} respected newspapers covering the Negro leagues, ranked Day ahead of Paige as the best pitcher in the league in 1942 and 1943. For his performance, Day was rewarded with $100 and a train ride back to Baltimore. The outcome of the game was thrown out on appeal by the Monarchs, however, for the Grays' use of unauthorized players. Without Day, the replay of the game was won by the Monarchs, sealing the series sweep.|$|E
25|$|In {{a classic}} Game 2, the score {{remained}} tied at 2 {{heading to the}} 11th inning. In the top half, Chone Figgins broke out of his postseason slump by <b>blooping</b> an RBI single to left field to score Gary Matthews, Jr. to give the Angels a 3-2 lead. However, in the bottom half, Alex Rodriguez lined a home run into the short right-field porch off Angels closer Brian Fuentes {{to tie the game}} at 3. In the bottom of the 13th, Maicer Izturis threw away a potential double play ball from Melky Cabrera to score Jerry Hairston, Jr. with the winning run, giving the Yankees a 2-0 series lead.|$|R
25|$|On September 2, 2001, {{he retired}} the first 26 Boston Red Sox he faced; he then ran pinch-hitter Carl Everett (batting for Joe Oliver) to a 1-and-2 count before Everett <b>blooped</b> a single to left-center. Mussina then retired leadoff man Trot Nixon on a grounder, {{striking}} out 13 batters in a one-hit 1–0 shutout. The losing pitcher was David Cone—the pitcher {{of the last}} perfect game at the time, on July 18, 1999. Although Mussina did not achieve perfection, James Buckley, Jr. considered it special enough to include an appendix chapter about it in his 2002 book Perfect: The Inside Story of Baseball's Sixteen Perfect Games.|$|R
5000|$|... "Work from Home" [...] {{was ranked}} at number 14 on the 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time list, {{published}} by Billboard. S.J.H. dismissed {{the fact that}} the word [...] "work" [...] was mentioned [...] "95 times" [...] and added that the [...] "repetition is part of its charm". J.H. finishes their statement saying that the group secured their biggest hit to date with [...] "melodies that counter the <b>blooping</b> synths, punctuating a relatively sparse beat" [...] and commended the equal delivery of each member, specifically Cabello, whose vocals contradict the [...] "song’s straightforward verses with acrobatic runs that bring it all home." ...|$|R
2500|$|Sportswriters {{extended}} on the idea. Shulman {{wrote in}} 1930 of hearing them talk about short pop flies as [...] "Chinese line drives". Texas leaguers, or high <b>bloop</b> singles that fell between the infielders and outfielders, hit in Pacific Coast League games were likewise called [...] "Japanese line drives".|$|E
2500|$|Buck made {{controversial}} {{statements about}} singer Bobby Vinton prior to Game 4 of the 1990 National League Championship Series. After Vinton muffed {{the lyrics of}} [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] in his home town of Pittsburgh, Buck lightly referenced Vinton's Polish heritage. Buck soon got death threats from Pittsburgh Pirate fans, who even {{went as far as}} leaving a footprint on Buck's hotel pillow. The next day, CBS Sports executive producer Ted Shaker spotted Buck in the hotel lobby and told Buck that he was in trouble. The final baseball play that Jack Buck narrated for CBS television was Gene Larkin's game winning <b>bloop</b> single in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series.|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} a {{primitive}} recursive programming language is one that contains basic arithmetic operators (e.g. + and −, or ADD and SUBTRACT), conditionals and comparison (IF-THEN, EQUALS, LESS-THAN), and bounded loops, such as the basic for loop, {{where there is a}} known or calculable upper bound to all loops (FOR i FROM 1 to n, with neither i nor n modifiable by the loop body). No control structures of greater generality, such as while loops or IF-THEN plus GOTO, are admitted in a primitive recursive language. Douglas Hofstadter's <b>BlooP</b> in Gödel, Escher, Bach is one such. [...] Adding unbounded loops (WHILE, GOTO) makes the language partially recursive, or Turing-complete; Floop is such, as are almost all real-world computer languages.|$|E
