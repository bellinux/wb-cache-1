If {{this was the case}} during the period, the cashel of Aileach would have <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> sight to behold for the local population and the fact that a ringfort of its magnitude was even built shows the importance of its occupants. Its relative proximity to Derry shows a conscious attempt to remain connected to that ecclesiastical site.|$|E

25|$|Their {{first game}} {{was at the}} MCG on New Year’s Day 1862, against a Victorian XVIII. The Englishmen also wore {{coloured}} sashes around their waists to identify each player and were presented with hats to shade them from the sun. Some estimates put {{the crowd at the}} MCG that day at 25,000. It must have <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> picture with a new 6000 seat grandstand, coloured marquees ringing the ground and a carnival outside. Stephenson said that the ground was better than any in England. The Victorians however, were no match for the English at cricket and the visitors won by an innings and 96 runs.|$|E
500|$|The {{audience}} {{reception of}} Jonas Quinn was sparked with controversy over Michael Shanks' {{departure from the}} show. When rumors began late in 2001 that Showtime would also not be renewing StargateSG-1 after its fifth season, panicking fans rallied to save the show and Daniel's character, starting massive write-in campaigns and setting up websites such as the [...] "Save Daniel Jackson" [...] site. The SciFi Channel eventually ordered a sixth season of the show, but the character of Jonas continued to be distrusted by loyal fans, who were concerned that Daniel's death might cause the SG-1 team to lose its moral compass. Robert C. Cooper summarized that [...] "there's <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> bit of ire directed by fans towards Daniel's replacement" [...] after the airing of [...] "Meridian", but he hoped that the character would grow on fans eventually. Producer Joseph Mallozzi claimed {{at the beginning of}} season 6 to still get the [...] "odd incoherent rambling death threat passed along to me from the [...] site".|$|E

As we were very close in, I shouted to them to come on board and deliver up their arms, or we would blow them all to pieces. It seemed rather odd for a regiment on shore to be surrendering to a ship! They hauled down their colors, and the Colonel and command came on board and gave themselves up as prisoners of war. The regiment was called the Chalmette Regiment, and has <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> famous one. The officers were released on parole and allowed to retain their sidearms, all except one Captain, who I discovered was from New Hampshire." ...|$|E
2500|$|United States {{federal law}} {{enforcement}} officials have expressed concern about AAS use by police officers. [...] "It's a big problem, and {{from the number of}} cases, it's something we shouldn't ignore. It's not that we set out to target cops, but when we're {{in the middle of an}} active investigation into steroids, there have <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> few cases that have led back to police officers," [...] says Lawrence Payne, a spokesman for the United States Drug Enforcement Administration. The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin stated that “Anabolic steroid abuse by police officers is a serious problem that merits greater awareness by departments across the country". It is also believed that police officers across the United Kingdom [...] "are using criminals to buy steroids" [...] which he claims to be a top risk factor for police corruption.|$|E
2500|$|In Game 7 at Busch Memorial Stadium, Lolich, also {{pitching}} on two days' rest, faced Gibson. Both men pitched brilliantly, putting zeros up on {{the scoreboard}} {{for much of the}} game. In the bottom of the sixth inning, the Cardinals looked primed to take the lead as Lou Brock singled to lead off the inning, only to be promptly picked off first base by Lolich. One out later, Curt Flood followed with another single, and was also picked off first by Lolich. In the top of the seventh, an exhausted Gibson finally cracked, giving up two-out singles to Norm Cash and Willie Horton. Jim Northrup then struck the decisive blow, lashing a triple to center field over the head of Flood, who appeared to misjudge how hard the ball was hit. That scored both Cash and Horton; Northrup himself was then brought home by a Bill Freehan double. Detroit added an insurance run in the ninth. A solo home run by Mike Shannon was all the Cardinals could muster against Lolich as the Tigers took the game, 4–1, and the Series, 4–3. For his three victories that propelled the Tigers to the World championship, Lolich was named the World Series Most Valuable Player. Through 2015, Lolich is the last pitcher to have three complete-game victories in a single World Series. Also, at the time, Detroit was only the third team ever to come back from being down 3 games to 1 and win a World Series title. [...] The others were the 1925 Pittsburgh Pirates (defeated Washington Senators) and the 1958 New York Yankees (defeated Milwaukee Braves).
