5|$|Investigators {{found that}} as the jet was {{beginning}} its takeoff rotation, engine number one separated from the left wing, flipping {{over the top of}} the wing and landing on the runway. As the engine separated from the aircraft, it severed hydraulic lines that locked the wing's leading edge slats in place and damaged a three-foot section of the left wing's leading edge. Aerodynamic forces acting on the wing resulted in an uncommanded retraction of the outboard slats. As the jet began to climb, the damaged left wing, with no engine, produced far less lift (stalled) than the right wing, with its slats still deployed and its engine running at full takeoff speed. The disrupted and unbalanced aerodynamics of the aircraft caused it to roll abruptly to the left until it was partially inverted, reaching a <b>bank</b> <b>angle</b> of 112 degrees, before crashing in an open field by a trailer park near the end of the runway. The engine separation was attributed to damage to the pylon structure holding the engine to the wing, caused by improper maintenance procedures used at American Airlines.|$|E
5|$|TWR {{purchased}} {{the rights to}} the V64V engine from Austin Rover in 1989 and developed a completely new turbocharged engine, codenamed JV6, under the auspices of Allan Scott, with proportions roughly similar to the V64V, and suitable for Sportcar racing. As the V64V was originally naturally aspirated, TWR needed to redesign all parts of the engine to accommodate forced induction. A few of the changes included increasing the displacement to 3.5 litres, strengthening the internals, and adding two Garrett TO3 turbochargers. The JV6 engine would first be used in the JaguarSport XJR-10 and XJR-11 racing cars; its compact dimensions and low weight made it an ideal candidate for the XJ220. The engine had a 90° <b>bank</b> <b>angle,</b> four valves per cylinder and belt-driven double overhead camshafts. It shares a number of design features with the Cosworth DFV Formula One engine.|$|E

25|$|For an aircraft, {{they can}} be {{obtained}} with three rotations around its principal axes if done in the proper order.

We established a new method to evaluate the femoral curvature in three-dimensional (3 D) space and reveal its influencing factors in Chinese population. Methods. 3 D models of 426 femurs and the medullary canal were constructed using Mimics software. We standardized the positions of all femurs using 3 ds Max software. After measuring the anatomical parameters, including the radius of femoral curvature (RFC) and <b>banking</b> <b>angle,</b> of the femurs using the established femur-specific coordinate system, we analyzed and determined {{the relationships between the}} anatomical parameters of the femur and the general characteristics of the population.

25|$|When {{an engine}} on a multi-engine {{aircraft}} fails, the thrust distribution on the aircraft becomes asymmetrical, {{resulting in a}} yawing moment {{in the direction of}} the failed engine. A sideslip develops, causing the total drag of the aircraft to increase considerably, resulting in a drop in the aircraft's rate of climb. The rudder, and to a certain extent the ailerons via the use of <b>bank</b> <b>angle,</b> are the only aerodynamic controls available to the pilot to counteract the asymmetrical thrust yawing moment.|$|E
25|$|The final report, {{published}} by Indonesian investigator NTSC, {{concluded that the}} crash was caused due to pilot error. The evidence indicates that during the final segment of the flight, both crew member were looking outside the aircraft to sight the runway. During this period the flight path of the aircraft varied between 376 and 585 feet and the <b>bank</b> <b>angle</b> increased from 11 to 38 degree to the left. The rate of descent then increased significantly up to about 3000 feet per minute and finally the aircraft impacted into the sea.|$|E
25|$|Heavier {{aircraft}} are more stable and {{more resistant to}} yawing moments, and therefore have lower VMCAs. The longitudinal centre of gravity affects the VMCA as well: the further from the tail it is, the lower the minimum control speed, because the rudder {{will be able to}} provide a larger yawing moment, and so it is easier to counteract the imbalance in thrust. The lateral centre of gravity also has an effect: the nearer the inoperative engine it is, the larger the moment of the working engine, and so the more force the rudder has to apply. This means that if the lateral centre of gravity shifts towards the inoperative engine, the aircraft's VMCA will increase. The thrust of most engines depends on altitude and temperature; increasing altitude and higher temperatures decrease thrust. This means that if the air temperature is higher and the aircraft has a higher altitude, the force of the operative engine will be lower, the rudder will have to provide less counteractive force, and so the VMCA will be lower. The <b>bank</b> <b>angle</b> also influences the minimum control speed. A small <b>bank</b> <b>angle</b> away from the inoperative engine is required for smallest possible sideslip and therefore lower VMCA. Finally, if the P-factor of the working engine increases, then its yawing moment increases, and the aircraft's VMCA increases as a result.|$|E

500|$|In {{preparation}} for the 1994 Fairchild air show, Holland was again selected as the command pilot for the B-52 demonstration flight. On 15 June 1994, Holland briefed the new wing commander, Colonel William Brooks, on the proposed flight plan. The demonstration profile—as briefed by Holland—included numerous violations of regulations, including steep <b>bank</b> <b>angles,</b> low-altitude passes, and steep pitch attitudes. Brooks ordered Holland not to exceed 45° <b>bank</b> <b>angles</b> or 25° pitch attitude during the demonstration. During the first practice session, on 17 June, Holland repeatedly violated these orders. Brooks witnessed this, but took no action. Pellerin flew with Holland on that flight and reported to Brooks that, [...] "the profile looks good to him; looks very safe, well within parameters." [...] The next practice flight on 24 June ended with the crash.|$|R
25|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} accident was the loss of spatial orientation by the crew and chiefly by the Captain who was piloting the aircraft during the landing phase. The plane banked left, overturned and went into a rapid descent. The loss of spatial orientation occurred in the night, while flying in the clouds, with autopilot and autothrottle switched off. Poor CRM and insufficient training for using the Western type of attitude indicators contributed to the accident. The pilots had previously flown Tupolev Tu-134 and Antonov An-24 with {{a different type of}} attitude indicator (where the <b>bank</b> <b>angle</b> is shown by the movements of an aircraft symbol, and the indicator's background does not turn left or right).|$|E
25|$|The {{vertical}} tail or vertical stabilizer of a multi-engine aircraft plays {{a crucial role}} in maintaining directional control while an engine fails or is inoperative. The larger the tail, the more capable it will be of providing the required force to counteract the asymmetrical thrust yawing moment. This means that the smaller the tail is, the higher the VMCA will be. However, a larger tail is more costly and harder to accommodate, and comes with other aerodynamic issues such as increased prevalence of slipstreams. Engineers designing the {{vertical tail}} must make a decision based on, amongst other factors, their budget, the weight of the aircraft, and the maximum <b>bank</b> <b>angle</b> of 5° (away from the inoperative engine), as stated by FAR.|$|E

25|$|Reading {{the control}} yoke {{data from the}} FDR {{revealed}} that the pilots made a crucial error by pulling back on the control yoke throughout the dive with the stick-shaker audible on the CVR from {{the onset of the}} dive. This raised the aircraft's angle of attack, removed all aileron authority, prevented recovery from the roll induced by the rudder, and caused an aerodynamic stall. Because the aircraft had entered a slip, pulling back on the yoke only aggravated the <b>bank</b> <b>angle</b> further. Boeing's test pilots reenacted the fatal dive in both a simulator, as well as a test 737-300 by flying the same parameters on the accident FDR, and found that recovery from a fully deflected rudder at level flight, while at 190 knot crossover speed, was accomplished by turning the wheel to the opposite direction of the roll, and not pulling back on the yoke to regain aileron authority. The NTSB remarked that no airline had ever trained a pilot on the proper recovery technique for the situation experienced by the pilots and that the pilots had just 10 seconds from the onset of the roll to troubleshoot before recovery of the aircraft was impossible. The FDR revealed that after the aircraft stalled, it along with the crew and passengers were subjected up to a 4g load throughout the dive until impact with the ground in an 80 degree nose-down attitude traveling at approximately 300mph under significant sideslip.|$|E
25|$|A third update was {{published}} on 10 March 2016. This Special Bulletin covered the organisation of the airshow at Shoreham, and airshows in the United Kingdom in general, with {{particular attention to}} risk management. Comparison was made with how airshows are organised in Australia, Canada and the United States. British civil and military rules were examined separately. It was reported that at the 2014 Shoreham Airshow, G-BXFI had overflown Lancing with a <b>bank</b> <b>angle</b> in excess of 90°. The pilot had not been instructed to stop his display. The AAIB did not name the pilot of G-BXFI who flew the 2014 display. It was also reported that the Flying Display Director at both displays did not have prior knowledge of the display intended to be flown. The issue of low flying during air displays was investigated. A previous accident involving glider BGA 4665 at an air race in Leicestershire in August 2005 had resulted in a recommendation to the CAA to change a rule. This had not been done and new rules subsequently introduced {{had the effect of}} leaving that rule unchanged, despite the CAA agreeing with the recommendation to change it. It was noted that the police had no powers to prevent people from watching an airshow from outside the boundaries of the venue where it was taking place. In the case of Shoreham, neither Sussex Constabulary nor the organisers had asked for such powers. Signs had been put out stating that viewing was prohibited and that offenders may be prosecuted. Another issue considered was how often CAA Flight Standards Officers attended airshows: only 1.4% of airshows in 2014 and 7.1% of airshows in 2015 had been attended. Fourteen recommendations were made. In January 2017, the CAA stated that it accepted all the recommendations made by the AAIB.|$|E
500|$|The NTSB's final {{hearing on}} May 1, 2007 {{determined}} that [...] "the pilots’ inadequate planning, judgment, and airmanship {{in the performance}} of a 180-degree turn maneuver inside of a limited turning space" [...] caused the crash.

500|$|An earlier {{incident}} occurred in 1991 when a B-52 piloted by Holland performed a circle above a softball {{game in which}} Holland's daughter was participating.

This phenomenon is a stall that occurs at a higher airspeed than the design stall speed – which always refers to {{straight and level flight}} – because the aircraft is turning. Due to the bank of 60° or more, the stall speed for the aircraft at that moment was [...] Thus, flying 2 knots slower, the aircraft stalled, without having sufficient altitude to recover before striking the ground.|$|E

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{situation}} awareness of an aircrew during poor visibility, different approaches emerged during {{the past couple of}} years. Enhanced vision systems (EVS – based upon sensor images) are one of those. They improve situation awareness of the crew, {{but at the same time}} introduce certain operational deficits. EVS present sensor data which might be difficult to interpret especially if the sensor used is a radar sensor. In particular an unresolved problem of fast scanning forward looking radar systems in the millimeter waveband is the inability to measure the elevation of a target. In order to circumvent this problem effort was made to reconstruct the missing elevation from a series of images. This could be described as a „Stereo radar“-attempt and is similar to the reconstruction using photography (angle-angle images) from different viewpoints to rebuilt the depth information.
