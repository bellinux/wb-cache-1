40|$|International audienceAdequate {{interpretation}} of biomonitoring results of occupational exposures to chemicals requires comparison values {{also referred to}} as <b>biological</b> interpretation <b>values.</b> Among these values are those derived in France by Anses, which are based on a structured approach led collectively by independent and multidisciplinary groups of scientific experts. Two types of occupational <b>biological</b> <b>values</b> are recommended by Anses: <b>biological</b> limit <b>values</b> and <b>biological</b> reference <b>values.</b> These values are derived from the data available in the scientific literature. The article first shows that the derivation by Anses of the <b>biological</b> <b>values</b> to be used for biomonitoring of occupational exposures is linked {{to the nature of the}} chemical examined. Depending upon whether the substance is a threshold or non-threshold toxicant, such as genotoxic carcinogens, the approach will be different.

60|$|Thus, Mr. Santayana is, perhaps, {{the most}} {{valuable}} of all the Browning critics. He {{has gone out of}} his way to endeavour to realise what it is that repels him in Browning, and he has discovered the fault which none of Browning's opponents have discovered. And in this he has discovered the merit which none of Browning's admirers have discovered. Whether the quality be a good or a bad quality, Mr. Santayana is perfectly right. The whole of Browning's poetry does rest upon primitive feeling; and the only comment to be added is that so does the whole of every one else's poetry. Poetry deals entirely with those great eternal and mainly forgotten wishes which are the ultimate despots of existence. Poetry presents things as they are to our emotions, not as they are to any theory, however plausible, or any argument, however conclusive. If love is in truth a glorious vision, poetry will say that it is a glorious vision, and no philosophers will persuade poetry to say that it is the exaggeration of the instinct of sex. If bereavement is a bitter and continually aching thing, poetry will say that it is so, and no philosophers will persuade poetry to say that it is an evolutionary stage of great <b>biological</b> <b>value.</b> And here comes in the whole value and object of poetry, that it is perpetually challenging all systems with the test of a terrible sincerity. The practical value of poetry is that it is realistic upon a point upon which nothing else can be realistic, the point of the actual desires of man. Ethics is the science of actions, but poetry is the science of motives. Some actions are ugly, and therefore some parts of ethics are ugly. But all motives are beautiful, or present themselves for the moment as beautiful, and therefore all poetry is beautiful. If poetry deals with the basest matter, with the shedding of blood for gold, it ought to suggest the gold as well as the blood. Only poetry can realise motives, because motives are all pictures of happiness. And the supreme and most practical value of poetry is this, that in poetry, as in music, a note is struck which expresses beyond the power of rational statement a condition of mind, and all actions arise from a condition of mind. Prose can only use a large and clumsy notation; it can only say that a man is miserable, or that a man is happy; it is forced to ignore that there are a million diverse kinds of misery and a million diverse kinds of happiness. Poetry alone, with the first throb of its metre, can tell us whether the depression is the kind of depression that drives a man to suicide, or the kind of depression that drives him to the Tivoli. Poetry can tell us whether the happiness is the happiness that sends a man to a restaurant, or the much richer and fuller happiness that sends him to church.|$|E

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} is to clarify {{relations}} between the value perspective of economics and other value perspectives and its significance for the interpreta-tion of normative statements and of anomalies found in stated preference (SP) surveys. The thesis contains two papers. The main objective of the first paper is to analyse and clarify the conceptual relations between different value-related terms. It is concluded that economic values has a clear meaning whereas other terms, often used to describe, and to motivate the preservation of, pastoral landscapes, have unclear normative implications. The economic concept of values is, in a sense, complete. Once the perspective is adopted it embraces, conceptually, all values of the pastoral landscape. With a specific interpretation of e. g. <b>biological</b> <b>values</b> these are conceptually included in the economic values. Other interpretations of <b>biological</b> <b>values</b> imply, on the other hand, perspectives of values that make economic values redundant.
