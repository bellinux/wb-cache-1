5|$|As of 2008, {{there has}} been little {{response}} to Pozdniakov's approach. However, Sproat (2007) <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> results from the frequency distributions are nothing more than an effect of Zipf's Law, and furthermore that neither rongorongo nor the old texts were representative of the Rapanui language, so that a comparison between them is unlikely to be enlightening.|$|E
5|$|Bhrigu– Bhrigu is {{a renowned}} sage of India, who is {{extremely}} powerful and malevolent. He <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Somras is never Evil, and hence mobilizes {{the war against}} Shiva. Held in high-esteem and fear by everyone, Bhrigu realizes the error of his ways after Sati is killed.|$|E
5|$|Campaign funding – The ACLU <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{current system}} is badly flawed, and {{supports}} a {{system based on}} public funding. The ACLU supports full transparency to identify donors. However, the ACLU opposes attempts to control political spending. The ACLU supported the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United v. FEC, which allowed corporations and unions more political speech rights.|$|E
50|$|Some people <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> town of Khambhat {{may be the}} Camanes of Ptolemy. James Tod <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{name comes}} from the Sanskrit Khambavati or 'City of the Pillar'.|$|R
50|$|Based upon several aggadic passages, Christiani argued <b>that</b> Pharisaic sages <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Messiah {{had lived}} during the Talmudic period, {{and that they}} must {{therefore}} have <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Messiah was Jesus.|$|R
50|$|Meltzer <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{only true}} type of anarchism was communistic. He opposed the individualist anarchism of {{people such as}} Benjamin Tucker, <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> private police <b>that</b> individualists support would {{constitute}} a government.|$|R
5|$|Clancy Brown as Hart Sterling, the firm's {{managing}} partner; Sterling {{inherited the}} title through his family. Sterling <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{law is a}} calling {{that can be used}} to enhance society and the world; he also believes the firm should do good, including pro bono work.|$|E
5|$|Cobb has {{consistently}} opposed the splitting {{of education and}} knowledge into discrete and insulated disciplines and departments. He <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> current university model encourages excessive abstraction because each specialized area of study defines its own frame of reference and then tends to ignore the others, discouraging interdisciplinary dialogue and inhibiting a broad understanding of the world.|$|E
5|$|He {{has pledged}} never {{to raise taxes}} and states he has never voted to approve a budget deficit. Paul <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> country could abolish the {{individual}} income tax by scaling back federal spending to its fiscal year 2000 levels; financing government operations would be primarily by excise taxes and non-protectionist tariffs. He endorses eliminating most federal government agencies, terming them unnecessary bureaucracies.|$|E
5000|$|Mormons since <b>the</b> 1840s have <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> God is changeable. They <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Father (like the Son) {{was twice}} [...] "born"—once as a spirit, {{and again as}} a mortal man. After he lived a mortal life, Mormons <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Father died, was resurrected, and {{achieved}} his godhood along {{with at least one}} wife whom Mormons refer to as the Heavenly Mother. Some <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Heavenly Father and Mother gave birth to the spirits of humanity through a sexual union. Modern Mormons <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Jesus, <b>the</b> Son, was the first born of these spirits.|$|R
50|$|Police did {{not ever}} <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> killings were random and always <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> family was {{specifically}} targeted, with Maria Martinez most likely being the primary target {{as she was}} shot rather than stabbed.|$|R
50|$|Consider {{a simple}} {{coordination}} game (the payoff matrix {{is to the}} right). The row player can play a if she can reasonably <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> column player could play A, since a is a best response to A. She can reasonably <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> column player can play A if it is reasonable for the column player to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> row player could play a. He can <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> she will play a if it is reasonable for him to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> she could play a, etc.|$|R
5|$|In Hindu philosophy, yoga is {{the name}} of one of the six {{orthodox}} (which accept the testimony of Vedas) philosophical schools. Karel Werner, author of Yoga And Indian Philosophy, <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> process of systematization of yoga which began in the middle and Yoga Upanishads culminated with the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.|$|E
5|$|In early Asomtavruli, {{the letters}} are of equal height. Georgian {{historian}} and philologist Pavle Ingorokva <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> direction of Asomtavruli, {{like that of}} Greek, was initially boustrophedon, though {{the direction of the}} earliest surviving texts is from left to the right.|$|E
5|$|Lukashenko <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{president}} should be a conservative person and avoid using modern electronic gadgets such as an iPad or iPhone. He used to play bayan and football, but abandoned both during his presidency. He is a keen skier and ice hockey forward, who played exhibition games alongside international hockey stars. His two elder sons also play hockey, sometimes alongside their father.|$|E
50|$|Since Fana Church {{was rather}} big {{compared}} to other rural churches, some <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> church was a county church in its early years. It is <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hospital next to the church was shut down around 1300.|$|R
2500|$|The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> prophecy was {{fulfilled}} in {{the person}} of Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad, the second Caliph while the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> prophecies related to the [...] "promised son" [...] are allegorical in nature.|$|R
50|$|Formalists <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{relevant}} {{principles of}} law {{of a given}} area can be discerned by surveying the case law of <b>that</b> area. Langdell <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only resources needed to create a science of law was a law library.|$|R
5|$|Modern {{proponents of}} social trinitarianism often {{claim to have}} been {{influenced}} by the Cappadocians' dynamic picture of the Trinity. However, it would be fundamentally incorrect to identify Gregory as a social Trinitarian, as his theology emphasises the unity of God's will, and he clearly <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> identities of the Trinity are the three persons, not the relations between them.|$|E
5|$|The Safety Board <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{flight crew}} of Flight 405 {{should have taken}} more {{positive}} steps to assure a contamination-free wing, such as entering the cabin {{to look at the}} wing from a closer range. Although the Safety Board acknowledges that the detection of minimal amounts of contamination, sufficient to cause aerodynamic performance problems, is difficult and may not be possible without a tactile inspection, an observation from the cabin would have improved the chance of seeing some contamination and might have prompted the flight crew to return to the gate. The Safety Board <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> flight crew’s failure to take such precautions and the decision to attempt takeoff while unsure of wing cleanliness led to this accident and is a cause of it.|$|E
5|$|Although {{reviews in}} the birding and ornithological press {{have often been}} favourable, there have been criticisms. Peter Kennerley, author and Asian bird expert, {{considered}} {{that some of the}} illustrations are small and garish or technically inaccurate. He also <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> over-reliance on sometimes very old museum specimens and dismissal of the wealth of observational data filed by amateur travelling birders is a mistake, and states that many of the taxonomic decisions appear to be random choices, unsupported by published research.|$|E
50|$|Members of the Church of God International <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> church {{built by}} the Father through Jesus Christ is {{relevant}} to salvation. They also <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> church has a vital influence in a person's thinking, character, priorities and beliefs.|$|R
50|$|Proponents of this <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{sheer size}} of the Chinese {{bureaucracy}} (and hence, the sheer amount of resources that it consumes) {{is due to the}} extraordinary number of counties and townships—and they <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> number can be reduced.|$|R
50|$|Thor {{uses his}} powers to cleanse the dead from the Morlock tunnels with fire, which causes {{problems}} for the X-Men, who briefly <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> firestorm was caused by <b>the</b> Marauders and <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> New Mutants died in said fire.|$|R
5|$|Apatodon mirus, {{based on}} a scrap of {{vertebra}} Marsh first {{thought to be a}} mammalian jaw, has been listed as a synonym of Allosaurus fragilis. However, it was considered indeterminate beyond Dinosauria by Dan Chure, and Mickey Mortimer <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> synonymy of Apatodon with Allosaurus was due to correspondence to Ralph Molnar by John McIntosh, whereby the latter reportedly found a paper saying that Othniel Charles Marsh admitted that the Apatodon holotype was actually an allosaurid dorsal vertebra.|$|E
5|$|At {{the scene}} of the shooting, Scully reasons that at the short range from which Goodensnake was shot, it would have been {{impossible}} to mistake him for an animal. However, Mulder finds tracks leading to the area that appear to change from human to something more animal in nature. Scully dismisses this, but finds a large section of shed human skin nearby. She <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Parkers knowingly killed Goodensnake, but knows that they could not have skinned him since no signs of such injury were found on the body.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise {{arrives at}} the Valakian homeworld, where they are met by Esaak, the Valakian {{director}} of a clinic, and Larr, a Menk orderly. T'Pol, Phlox, Archer, and Ensign Sato make {{a tour of the}} medical facility. Sato discovers that there is a second lesser-evolved yet unaffected race, the Menk, who live alongside the Valakians. Phlox makes the startling discovery that the Valakians are slowly dying out, not from an easily curable medical condition, but because of a genetic disease which is experiencing an accelerated rate of mutation. He also <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> answer to a cure may lie in the Menk.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{libretto}} of La Juive has {{a goal of}} reconsidering {{the status}} of Jews in French society. Others <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> clichéd portrayal of the Jew Eléazar as secretive, vengeful and materialistic does not bear out this interpretation.|$|R

50|$|The {{fusiform}} {{face area}} (FFA) {{is a part}} of the brain located in the fusiform gyrus with a debated purpose. Some researchers <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> FFA is evolutionary purposed for face perception. Others <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> FFA discriminates between any familiar stimuli.|$|R
5|$|From {{his base}} in Tel Aviv, Holocaust {{survivor}} Emmanuel Lieber directs {{a group of}} Jewish Nazi hunters in search of Adolf Hitler. Lieber <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> former Führer is still alive, and following rumours and hearsay, he tracks Hitler's movements through South America. After months of wading through swamps in the Amazon jungle, the search party finds the 90-year-old alive in a clearing. Lieber flies to San Cristóbal where he awaits the group's return with their captive. But getting the old man out of the jungle alive is more difficult than getting in, and their progress is further hampered by heavy thunderstorms.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, after The Bell Jar was published, Plath {{began working}} on another {{literary}} work titled Double Exposure. It was never published and disappeared around 1970. Theories {{about what happened to}} the unfinished manuscript are repeatedly brought up in the book Sylvia Plath's Fiction: A Critical Study by Luke Ferretter. Ferretter also claims that the rare books department at Smith College in Massachusetts has a secret copy of the work under seal. Ferretter <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> draft of Double Exposure may have been destroyed, stolen, or even lost. He presumes in his book that the draft may lie unfound in a university archive.|$|E
5|$|In 1974 the {{commission}} was reopened and issued a supplementary report, which remained classified for 25 years until published by the magazine India Today. The report said that 26,000 people were killed, rapes numbered in the hundreds, and that the Mukti Bahini rebels engaged in widespread rape and other human rights abuses. Sumit Ganguly, a political scientist, <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Pakistani establishment has yet {{to come to terms}} with the atrocities carried out, saying that, in a visit to Bangladesh in 2002, Pervez Musharraf expressed regret for the atrocities rather than accepting responsibility.|$|E
25|$|In {{certain areas}} of India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, it is {{traditionally}} <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> jackal's horn can grant wishes and reappear to its owner at its own accord when lost.

50|$|Bush Administration {{opponents of}} <b>the</b> Agreed Framework <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> North Korean {{government}} {{never intended to}} give up a nuclear weapons program.
