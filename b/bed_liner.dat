Returning to the mysterious apartment, he sat by his guest and began to entertain him so well by his witty and genial converse that the poor <b>Bed</b> <b>Liner</b> almost forgot the cold streets from which he had been so recently and so singularly rescued. A servant brought some tender cold fowl and tea biscuits and a glass of miraculous wine; and Thomas felt the glamour of Arabia envelop him. Thus half an hour sped quickly; and then the honk of the returned motor car at the door suddenly drew the Grand Duke to his feet, with another soft petition for a brief absence.|$|E

5000|$|Polyurea was {{originally}} developed to protect tabletop edges {{which led to}} the development of two-component polyurethane and polyurea spray elastomers took place in the 1990s by Mark S Barton and Mark Schlichter [...] Its fast reactivity and relative moisture insensitivity made it useful for coatings on large surface area projects, such as secondary containment, manhole and tunnel coatings, tank <b>liners,</b> and truck <b>bed</b> <b>liners.</b> Excellent adhesion to concrete and steel is obtained with the proper primer and surface treatment. They can also be used for spray molding and armor. [...] Some polyureas reach strengths of 6000psi (40MPa) tensile and over 500% elongation making it a tough coating. The quick cure time allows many coats to be built up quickly.|$|R

5000|$|The largest use of SAPs {{is found}} in {{personal}} disposable hygiene products, such as baby diapers, adult protective underwear and sanitary napkins. [...] SAP was discontinued from use in tampons due to 1980s concern over a link with toxic shock syndrome. [...] SAP is also used for blocking water penetration in underground power or communications cable, horticultural water retention agents, control of spill and waste aqueous fluid, and artificial snow for motion picture and stage production. The first commercial use was in 1978 for use in feminine napkins in Japan and disposable <b>bed</b> <b>liners</b> for nursing home patients in the USA. Early applications in the US market were with small regional diaper manufacturers as well as Kimberly Clark, with advancements made quickly with the process breakthrough of proper product placement at the optimal depth in the media.|$|R
40|$|Rotational molding is {{a unique}} process for {{producing}} hollow plastic parts. Rotational molding offers advantages of low cost tooling and can produce very large parts with complicated shapes. Products made by rotational molding include water tanks with capacities up to 20, 000 gallons, truck <b>bed</b> <b>liners,</b> playground equipment, air ducts, Nylon fuel tanks, pipes, toys, stretchers, kayaks, pallets, and many others. Thermotropic liquid crystalline polymers are an important class of engineering resins employed {{in a wide variety}} of applications. Thermotropic liquid crystalline polymers resins are composed of semi-rigid, nearly linear polymeric chains resulting in an ordered mesomorphic phase between the crystalline solid and the isotropic liquid. Ordering of the rigid rod-like polymers in the melt phase yields microfibrous, self-reinforcing polymer structures with outstanding mechanical and thermal properties. Rotational molding of liquid crystalline polymer resins results in high strength and high temperature hollow structures useful in a variety of applications. Various fillers and reinforcements can potentially be added to improve properties of the hollow structures. This paper focuses on the process and properties of rotationally molded liquid crystalline polymers...|$|R

5000|$|... ==New {{developments}} in Removable, Eco-friendly and customizable coatings== A recent trend in paint protection is DIY and professional applications that are roller on, brush on, and spray on high-build films, {{that provide a}} rugged protective finish and are removable. One such product is PaintArmorDIY and PaintArmorPRO by ColorXlabs. This is a water-borne, ecological protective coating. Some advancements are 1) Removability 2) Infinite thickness adjustment and 3) Color matching to OEM Colors. A rugged, textured finish is the result, with capabilities to match any factory color. In the off-road industry, popularity of rugged <b>bed</b> <b>liner</b> coatings on body panels has been taking off. PaintArmorDIY is similar to textured surfaces like Line-X or Rhino Liner without as much roughness and easier to care for surface that remains removable.|$|E
25|$|In the United States {{federal law}} does not dictate any {{container}} requirements for cremation. Certain states, however, may require an opaque or non-transparent container of all cremations. This can be a simple corrugated-cardboard box or a wooden casket (coffin). Most casket manufacturers provide lines of caskets that are specially built for cremation. Another option is a cardboard box that fits inside a wooden shell, {{which is designed to}} look like a traditional casket. After the funeral service, the box is removed from the shell before cremation, permitting the shell to be re-used. Funeral homes may also offer rental caskets, which are traditional caskets used only during the services, after which the bodies are transferred to other containers for cremation. Rental caskets are sometimes designed with removable <b>beds</b> and <b>liners,</b> which are replaced after each use.|$|R
50|$|A flower {{car is a}} type {{of vehicle}} used in the funeral industry, used to carry flowers for the burial service, or {{sometimes}} to carry the coffin under a bed of flowers. Built on the same commercial chassis as a hearse, the flower car has half-height rear bodywork on the rear similar to a pickup truck bed. The <b>bed</b> contains a <b>liner</b> to hold the flowers, normally built of stainless steel to resist rust. Some flower cars have a raised, flat tonneau cover across the bed at the top, upon which the flowers sit; the center portion sometimes is designed to raise and lower, hydraulically or by hand. If the flower car is designed to carry a casket, it will be stored under the tonneau cover in the space beneath, behind the opening rear gate.|$|R

50|$|Most plants use {{photosynthesis}} and evapotranspiration (ET). EcocyclET is a closed-loop {{operation that}} employs lined beds of sand, crushed stone and gravels and specified plantings. Effluent from septic tanks, greywater, composting toilets leachate or urine from separating toilets, is recirculated through the bed. There, naturally occurring micro-organisms convert the chemical constituents of the wastewater into nutrients for plants growth. The impervious <b>bed</b> <b>liner</b> ensures that no effluent {{can enter the}} subsurface environment or nearby receiving waters. All the wastewater will be ultimately transpirated as un-transpirated effluent is drained back into a recycle tank, stored and pumped back to the bed when the conditions for evapotranspiration are optimal.The system can also by used as a greywater reuse planter to be installed where soils are too poor {{to be considered for}} a soil absorption system.|$|E

40|$|In recent {{incidents}} {{reported to}} the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), fires spontaneously ignited when workers or others attempted to fill portable gasoline containers (gas cans) in the backs of pickup trucks equipped with plastic bed liners or in cars with carpeted surfaces. Serious skin burns and other injuries resulted. Similar incidents {{in the last few}} years have resulted in warning bulletins from several private and government organizations. These fires result from the buildup of static electricity. The insulating effect of the <b>bed</b> <b>liner</b> or carpet prevents the static charge generated by gasoline flowing into the container or other sources from grounding. The discharge of this buildup to the grounded gasoline dispenser nozzle may cause a spark and ignite the gasoline. Both ungrounded metal (most hazardous) and plastic gas containers have been involved in these incidents. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 "August 1998. "Caption title.

40|$|The Diavik Diamond Mine {{is located}} in a region of {{continuous}} permafrost on East Island in Lac de Gras, Northwest Territories. Following diamond extraction from the kimberlite ore, the remaining “Processed Kimberlite ” material is permanently stored in the Processed Kimberlite Containment (PKC) Facility consisting of lined perimeter dams which are raised in stages throughout the mine life. The design and construction of the first three phases of the East and West Dams included an HDPE liner installed on sand bedding. Following experience gained on the site using bituminous geomembrane liner for construction of collection ponds, the design and construction of the fourth and fifth phases of the PKC facility dams were changed to use a bituminous geomembrane liner. The bituminous geomembrane liner allowed for a greater range of bedding material options and easier installation over a greater range of sub-zero temperatures than the HDPE liner. This paper will present the general dam design and discuss the range of materials used for <b>liner</b> <b>bedding</b> and cover in the dam construction. The condition of the bituminous geomembrane liner exposed and cut out of a collection pond dam which was no longer required on the site will be presented.

40|$|Fortunately {{death from}} asthma is infrequent. Of the 86, 000 – 87, 000 people who {{die each year}} in Michigan, {{approximately}} 150 are caused by asthma. Despite their relatively infrequent occurrences, deaths from asthma are tragedies made more poignant because they are preventable. We recently became aware of a work-related asthma death: A man in his mid-forties {{was reported to have}} had asthma for 10 years developed an acute asthmatic attack at work. Normally he had help but on the morning he died he had sent his helper to do something else while he installed a spray-on <b>bed</b> <b>liner</b> in a van. His helper returned 20 minutes later to find the work completed, the equipment turned off and the individual gasping for breath on his knees outside the building. The helper immediately took the individual to an urgent care clinic. The individual collapsed {{at the door of the}} urgent care clinic. A nurse at the clinic began CPR. An ambulance arrived nine minutes later. Despite attempted resuscitation and transport to a nearby hospital, he was pronounced dead 46 minutes later. Wheezing was noted on auscultation during bagging. On autopsy, on microscopic examination, he was found to have mucus and eosinophils in his airways and numerous eosinophils in his mucosa. The basement membrane was thickened with hyperplasia of the mucus glands. There were aggregate...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} is to provide considerations for modifications to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) air sampling method for MDI: OSHA Method 47. These modifications can help improve {{the ability of the}} method to sample and derivatize MDI. The information provided in this document is not a directive or an industry standard. The information is intended as guidance. Users should independently determine what constitutes an appropriate practice relative to their own needs and circumstances. 1. SUMMARY OF THE METHOD 1. 1 Analyte: 4, 4 ’-Methylene diphenylisocyanate (MDI, Methylene di-p-phenyl diisocyanate); CAS [101 - 68 - 8]. (NOTE: this method may also be applied to the determination of 2, 4 ’-MDI if appropriate reference material is obtained for preparing spiking solutions and calibration standards. Chromatographic conditions would have to be adjusted based upon the calibration standards.) 1. 2 Matrix: Air 1. 3 Limitations: This method should not be used in applications where an MDI-containing mixture is aerosolized by heat and pressure and forced through a spray nozzle (e. g. spray polyurethane foam and spray-on truck <b>bed</b> <b>liner</b> applications). (Ref 7. 1) 1. 4 Procedure: Adsorption on 13 -mm glass fiber filters coated with 1 -(2 -pyridyl) piperazine (1, 2 -PP) and diethyl phthalate (DEP) at a flow rate of 1 L/min for 0. 25 to 4 -hour time intervals; desorption into acetonitrile/DMSO and analysis using reverse-phase liquid chromatography with UV or fluorescence detection (HPLC/UV or FLD). 1. 5 Basis and Validation: This method is an adaptation of OSHA Method 47 (Ref 7. 2); the validation conducted for that method applies to this method. Several of these adaptations were made to improve the ability of the method to sample and derivatize MDI in both vapor and aerosol form; validation of the sampler for MDI aerosol/vapor mixtures has also been investigated (Ref. 7. 3, 7. 4). The areas of the method in which changes were made from OSHA 47 are: americanchemistry. com...|$|E
