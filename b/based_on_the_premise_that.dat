5|$|A {{feature-length film}} that {{indirectly}} parodies Star Trek is Galaxy Quest. This film is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> <b>that</b> aliens monitoring the broadcast of an Earth-based TV series called Galaxy Quest, modeled heavily on Star Trek, {{believe that what}} they are seeing is real. Many Star Trek actors have been quoted saying that Galaxy Quest was a brilliant parody.|$|E
5|$|A {{central part}} of Macdonald's case {{concerned}} the redistribution of wealth from richer provinces to poorer ones. His argument was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> <b>that</b> richer provinces benefited from national economic policies such as high tariffs while poorer provinces were penalized by them. Macdonald suggested that compensatory subsidies to poorer, less-populated provinces be based on need, not population, {{so that they could}} pay for government services available {{in other parts of the}} country without having to impose higher-than-average levels of taxation.|$|E

5|$|Research {{has found}} a {{tentative}} benefit in using minocycline to treat schizophrenia. Nidotherapy or efforts to change the environment of people with schizophrenia to improve their ability to function, is also being studied; however, {{there is not enough}} evidence yet to make conclusions about its effectiveness. Negative symptoms have proven a challenge to treat, as they are generally not made better by medication. Various agents have been explored for possible benefits in this area. There have been trials on drugs with anti-inflammatory activity, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> <b>that</b> inflammation might {{play a role in the}} pathology of schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} time in the United States {{includes}} DST during both world wars, but no standardization of peacetime DST until 1966. In May 1965, for two weeks, St. Paul, Minnesota and Minneapolis, Minnesota were on different times, when the capital city decided to join most of the nation by starting Daylight Saving Time while Minneapolis opted to follow the later date set by state law. In the mid-1980s, Clorox (parent of Kingsford Charcoal) and 7-Eleven provided the primary funding for the Daylight Saving Time Coalition behind the 1987 extension to U.S. DST, and both Idaho senators voted for it <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> <b>that</b> during DST fast-food restaurants sell more French fries, which are made from Idaho potatoes.|$|E
5|$|Like the Battles of Marathon and Thermopylae, Salamis {{has gained}} {{something}} of a 'legendary' status (unlike, for instance, the more decisive Battle of Plataea), {{perhaps because of the}} desperate circumstances and the unlikely odds. A significant number of historians have stated that Salamis {{is one of the most}} significant battles in human history (though the same is often stated of Marathon). In a more extreme form of this argument, some historians argue that if the Greeks had lost at Salamis, the ensuing conquest of Greece by the Persians would have effectively stifled the growth of Western Civilization as we know it. This view is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> <b>that</b> much of modern Western society, such as philosophy, science, personal freedom and democracy are rooted in the legacy of Ancient Greece. Thus, this school of thought argues that, given the domination of much of modern history by Western Civilization, Persian domination of Greece might have changed the whole trajectory of human history. It is also worth mentioning that the celebrated blossoming of hugely influential Athenian culture occurred only after the Persian wars were won.|$|E

25|$|In {{statutory}} rape, overt {{force or}} threat {{need not be}} present.

In terms of individual income tax South Africans pay the 31st highest average income tax rate in the world.|$|E
25|$|Davitt founded Labour World in 1890; the {{newspaper}} {{was an early}} promoter of the British Labour Party. His support for socialism in his latter years was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> <b>that</b> Ireland could only achieve independence {{with the support of}} the British working class. This, along with his call for land nationalisation, often made him much misunderstood in Ireland. But he remained an inspiration for many others, such as for D. D. Sheehan's Irish Land and Labour Association (ILLA), and years later Mahatma Gandhi attributed the origin of his own mass movement of peaceful resistance in India to Davitt and the Land League.|$|E
25|$|Psychiatric {{psychotherapy}} {{blurred the}} distinction between psychiatry and psychology, and this trend continued {{with the rise of}} community mental health facilities and behavioral therapy, a thoroughly non-psychodynamic model which used behaviorist learning theory to change the actions of patients. A key aspect of behavior therapy is empirical evaluation of the treatment's effectiveness. In the 1970s, cognitive-behavior therapy arose, using similar methods and now including the cognitive constructs which had gained popularity in theoretical psychology. A key practice in behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy is exposing patients to things they fear, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> <b>that</b> their responses (fear, panic, anxiety) can be deconditioned.|$|E
