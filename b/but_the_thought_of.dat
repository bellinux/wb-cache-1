5|$|Matt {{returns to}} Genoa City with a reconstructed face, rapes Sharon once more, and is {{eventually}} captured. When Sharon ends up pregnant, {{it is unknown}} who the father is: Nick or Matt. An argument with Nick causes Sharon {{to give birth to}} a stillborn daughter, which is revealed to be Nick's following her death. Nick and Sharon's marriage weakens further when they both cheat on each other once more, Nick with Grace and Sharon with the Newman stableman Diego Guittierez (Greg Vaughan). Nick tries to forgive her, but when he witnesses Sharon and Victor kissing, things become harder to mend than ever. Sharon later runs away from town, depressed. When she returns, Nick accepts her and they reunite. However, a man named Cameron Kirsten (Linden Ashby) who physically abused her (after having an affair with her) followed Sharon to Genoa City, wanting to bed her again. Eventually, Cameron's schemes are foiled and Sharon and Nick return to their normal life at last. In 2005, a fourteen-year-old rebellious Cassie is killed in a car accident. Nick closes off his emotions and cheats on Sharon with his Newman Enterprises work friend Phyllis Summers. Phyllis ends up pregnant, with Jack or Nick as possible fathers. The original DNA test to determine the child's paternity returns inconclusive, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> losing another child leads Nick into lying, and claiming that he is Summer's father. Nick and Sharon divorce after an eleven-year marriage and he marries Phyllis instead. Their daughter, Summer Newman, is born. Sharon also moves on with her life, marrying Jack, which makes Nick feel uncomfortable. In 2007, Nick's flight on the Newman jet crashes and a body is never recovered; he is presumed dead, devastating his family and Sharon.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, a {{pregnancy}} was {{written into the}} character’s narrative. Natalie was shown to be distressed {{by the prospect of}} being a mother and planned to have an abortion. Speed commented [...] "Natalie desperately wants a baby <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> becoming a mother makes her unhappy. Her family background is so awful she doesn't want to make the same mistake her mother made, but feels the odds are stacked against her and Barry." [...] Viewers saw a “devastated Barry” react badly to the news in a special extended four-hander episode (written by Christopher Reason and directed by Clive Arnold) – the episode had a maternal theme with the action flitting between Barry and Natalie’s saga and scenes between Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) and his dying mother, which included revelations of child abuse and incest. An EastEnders spokesman said: [...] "We are very proud of the programme. The storylines involving Steve and his mother and Barry and Natalie are the stuff of intense drama. All four actors give incredible performances." ...|$|E

60|$|V. In general, this {{motion is}} <b>the</b> {{universal}} <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universal mind. This thought creates. All created things are <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> God.|$|R
60|$|There {{could be}} no {{adequate}} reply to this, so for a time all sat in moody silence. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> some were busy.|$|R

60|$|Beatrice smiled, {{but said}} nothing. She {{respected}} her father, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> his helping {{such a man}} as Harding was amusing.|$|E
5000|$|<b>But</b> Pontos, <b>the</b> great sea, was {{father of}} truthful Nereus who tells no lies, eldest of his sons. They {{call him the}} Old Gentleman because he is trustworthy, and gentle, and never forgetful of what is right, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> his mind are mild and righteous.|$|R
60|$|For a {{few minutes}} the process of {{mastication}} completely engrossed <b>the</b> trio, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fur-trader were busy, for he was disappointed to find that one whom he respected so much as Jonas Bellew should thus coolly state that he was aiding the interlopers.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{look out}} the window and I think that the garden looks nice and the grass looks cool, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>{{thoughts}}</b> <b>of</b> Eamonn Andrews come into my mind.

60|$|Sidi Hassan {{felt that}} there was an {{intended}} sarcasm in the last remark, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the dollars induced him to waive further discussion.|$|E
60|$|The {{party to}} which Theodore Roosevelt belonged {{was in the}} minority, so that the young assemblyman found {{he would have to}} {{struggle}} hard if he expected to be heard at all. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> such a struggle only put him on his mettle, and he plunged in with a vigor that astonished his opponents and caused great delight to his friends.|$|R
5000|$|... "All Haitians {{have been}} placed on a equal level field.

60|$|By and by {{that last}} enlightening moment came, and Madeline Hammond faced not only the love in her heart, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the man she loved.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{losing their}} baggage nerved {{them to do}} their best, and over the ground they flew in good shape, {{gradually}} closing the gap {{between them and the}} man they were after.|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} no {{bitterness}} in his voice. He had long known his mother's ambition for the younger boy, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it no longer rankled. Nothing mattered any more. Not even that.|$|E
6000|$|Ah! to get away--away from oneself! <b>But</b> at <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> her baby, {{her heart}} fell again. [...] "Is your leg quite hopeless?" [...] she said.|$|R

60|$|His whole being revolted, {{not alone}} against the {{injustice}} which {{had sent him}} into life imprisonment, <b>but</b> at <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long years of awful monotony which lay ahead of him.|$|R
60|$|I {{resolved}} to remain, {{even if it}} were at the peril of my life. I was not an over-brave boy, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> my father languishing in prison because of these men's misdeeds, nerved me to stay.|$|E
60|$|I {{was about}} to thank him and turn back, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Yoletta, to whom each heavy day now seemed a year, oppressed by heart, and I {{continued}} standing motionless, with downcast eyes, wishing, yet fearing, to speak.|$|E
6000|$|The terrible {{feeling that}} death was so near almost unnerved me, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Waboose {{caused me to}} utter a roar of mingled rage and despair as I doubled my fist and {{launched}} it full against the monster's nose! ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>the</b> mere <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> such {{separation}} fevered {{his spirit}} much, {{and in the}} evening he said, with the stillness of suspense: [...] "Have you seen Mr. Farfrae to-day, Elizabeth?" ...|$|R
60|$|The wild passion {{which he}} had felt for her changed to an agonizing horror, not only of her deed, <b>but</b> at <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> seeing her surrounded, rough-handled by the guard, shamed and treated as a mad and drunken wanton.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>the</b> more he <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it, <b>the</b> more {{sorry he}} felt that he had met George Purvis.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't," [...] replied Frank. [...] "I'd have it off my mind at once." [...] <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> facing Mr. Mann {{was not a}} {{pleasant}} one, and the boy hesitated. While deliberating upon what to do the office boy appeared.|$|E
6000|$|Lieutenant Smith-Oldwick shuddered. [...] "God!" [...] he exclaimed, [...] "I hope I don't {{have to face}} that.
