25|$|The {{original}} <b>base</b> <b>fabric</b> {{on which}} the images are embroidered is a woven purple gauze, {{which may have been}} imported; the later replica sections are stitched onto purple twill or plain white silk. The embroidery threads of the original are z-twisted (right laid) and are sewn exclusively in backstitch while the replica uses looser s-twisted yarn and a variety of different stitches. The looser twist of the yarn {{may be one of the}} reasons that the replica sections are less well-preserved.|$|E
25|$|More {{expensive}} saris had elaborate geometric, floral, or figurative ornaments or brocades {{created on}} the loom, {{as part of}} the fabric. Sometimes warp and weft threads were tie-dyed and then woven, creating ikat patterns. Sometimes threads of different colours were woven into the <b>base</b> <b>fabric</b> in patterns; an ornamented border, an elaborate pallu, and often, small repeated accents in the cloth itself. These accents are called buttis or bhuttis (spellings vary). For fancy saris, these patterns could be woven with gold or silver thread, which is called zari work.|$|E

50|$|You {{would make}} a very light weight nuno fabric by laying one layer of loose fiber onto an open weave <b>fabric</b> <b>base,</b> thus being {{suitable}} for a summer dress. A much heavier nuno fabric results from laying 3-4 layers of loose fibers onto an open weave <b>base</b> making <b>fabric</b> suitable for a winter coat. A pair of boots could be made using even more layers of fibers.|$|R
50|$|During {{the next}} 20 years, SVM <b>based</b> <b>fabric</b> {{was the main}} {{material}} for flexible anti-fragmentation and bullet-proof vests and helmets for Russian military and other governmental and private security organisations. Hundreds of thousands of vests and helmets were supplied {{and some of them}} are in use today. The next generation of Russian aramid fibre was created and put into large production scale in 1989 for composite applications under the tradename of ARMOS. The main features of this fibre were long lifetime under the load (more than 15 years), high modulus (110-160 GPa) and produced without any sizing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{composition of}} the disintegrating [...] "bath" [...] was not very friendly {{to the environment and}} has all but ceased to exist in developed countries. However, the practice is still being used to create laces in third world countries. Since the original development of chemical lace, other methods have been developed beyond the chemical washing method described above. These include the use of <b>base</b> <b>fabrics</b> that are water-soluble or that disintegrate under heat. These methods are generally too expensive or impractical for large-scale production. These are typically used by smaller embroidery facilities specializing in targeted markets, home-based businesses, or hobbyists.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the advent}} of the laser bridge, fabrics were first die-cut and then appliqués were sewed or {{embroidered}} on the <b>base</b> <b>fabric.</b> Usually used was an 8 mm thick steel die with heights ranging from 50 to 100 mm depending on how many pieces were to be cut at once. This process proved to present numerous difficulties.|$|E

These craftsmen and their families were treated generously by the Owari and settled in the Arimatsu und Narumi neighbourhoods. Only the <b>base</b> <b>fabric</b> is dyed, leaving parts that were knotted as white spots. This highly specialised process requires 6-12 months to complete.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} question {{addressed in this}} study is "what outerwear fabric types are preferred by consumer segments in each of the major climatic zones in Australia?" objectives are to: 1. examine consumer preference for fabric in each of the five major climatic zones in Australia, using fabric attribute levels as the choice criteria, in order to provide information to Stormboy on fabric attributes most preferred by consumers, and the market segments in each zone, <b>based</b> on these <b>fabric</b> attribute preferences; and 2. determine any significant differences in fabric preference between the climatic zones so as to indicate to Stormboy whether climate should be taken into consideration in the marketing of wool <b>based</b> <b>fabric.</b> This information on preference for fabric type, will enable Stormboy design wool <b>based</b> <b>fabrics</b> that match the fabric attribute requirement of consumers. The information on market segments will not only provide the fabric attribute requirements but also the possible size of the market. This study will develop a method to monitor consumer trends in fabric preference so that Stormboy can make informed decisions about their design and choice of wool <b>based</b> <b>fabric.</b> This study provides the required consumer information to Stormboy. It illustrates a method of research which can be used in decisions making by producers of products or services where there is heterogeneity in buyers' preferences, for:the development of new products or services;the renewal of a product or service;the positioning of a product or service; andthe ongoing monitoring of consumer preferences and retail compatibility with consumer preferences. As Green and Kreiger (1985) conclude, once preference and segments have been identified companies can react to (or possibly produce to) preference heterogeneity by modifications of their current product/service attributes (including price), distribution, and ++advertising/promotion. Companies are motivated to do so if the net payoff from modifying their offerings exceeds what the payoff would be without such modification. Companies may modify its product/marketing mix to include product line addition/deletion decisions as well as the repositioning of current offerings. The study begins by reviewing relevant literature on the function of clothing and fabric type, the position of wool in the apparel market, the effect of climate on choice, the key concepts of consumer behaviour and segmentation as a means of positioning products. The design of the research is summarised in Chapter 3, and the findings from a survey of consumers in five Australian centres are presented in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 discusses the implications of these findings and recommendations made to StormBoy. Conclusions relating to the study design, limitations and future research are addressed in Chapter 6...|$|R
