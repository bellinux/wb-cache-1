However, testing from the end of 1935 onward revealed serious stability problems. The second prototype was given a raised tailplane without dihedral, braced with struts, but this did not cure the issues, and the third prototype had a completely reworked tail, with a <b>boom</b> <b>structure</b> of larger cross-section that carried a tall single tailfin and a large rudder.

40|$|In this paper, the {{superior}} mid-frequency vibration isolation of a geometrically optimized lightweight structure is demonstrated. The initial structure under test {{here was a}} 4. 5 m long satellite boom consisting of 10 identical bays with equilateral triangular cross-sections. An unusual geometric variant of this, with inherent isolation characteristics, has been designed {{by the use of}} genetic algorithm (GA) methods. In order to obtain the best design, the joints in the boom were allowed to move around by 20 % of the length of each bay (i. e., ± 9 cm in all three translational directions). This work is based on results from a Fortran code (which was derived from receptance analysis) that are fully validated against detailed finite element (FE) models of the structure. The experimental forced response of the regular <b>boom</b> <b>structure</b> has been measured and compared with predicted curves. Finally, having obtained the geometrically optimized <b>boom</b> <b>structure,</b> its experimental response is compared with the theoretical results predicted by the receptance method.

50|$|Boom {{experienced}} {{her first}} job as both an editor and designer during her {{time at the}} Dutch Government Publishing and Printing Office. It was here that she was noticed by Ootje Oxenaar, a designer of Dutch banknotes, who invited her to design two catalogues for special edition postage stamps between years 1987-1988. To him, she was the ‘designer of the crazy ads’. The annual Dutch postage stamp books was considered a prestigious opportunity with previous designers had including Wim Crouwel, Karl Maartens and Gert Dumbar. Boom's experimental style was evident in this particular publication, through the rich layers of information and imagery. <b>Boom</b> <b>structured</b> the book in a Japanese style binding and had text crossing multiple pages with printed folds and translucent paper. Though well received by Oxenaar, this project drew a lot of public outcry for being overtly experimental in comparison to previous editions. Boom received much hate mail, particularly from stamp collectors. However, this controversy brought her name into the public stage and established her name as a designer.|$|R
40|$|The {{practical}} use of high-fidelity multidisciplinary optimization techniques in lowboom supersonic business jet designs {{has been limited}} {{because of the high}} computational cost associated with CFD-based evaluations of both the performance and the loudness of the ground boom of the aircraft. This is particularly true of designs that involve the sonic boom loudness as either a cost function or a constraint because gradient-free optimization techniques may become necessary, leading to even larger numbers of function evaluations. If, in addition, the objective of the design method is to account for the performance of the aircraft throughout its mission (T/O and landing, climb, acceleration, etc.) while including important multi-disciplinary trade-offs between the relevant disciplines (performance, <b>boom,</b> <b>structures,</b> stability and control, propulsion, etc.) the situation only worsens. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose a hierarchical multi-fidelity design approach where high-fidelity models are only used where and when they are needed to correct the shortcomings of the low-fidelity models. Our design approach consists of two basic components: a multi-disciplinary aircraft synthesis tool (PASS) that uses highly-tuned low-fidelity models of all of the relevant disciplines an...|$|R

40|$|Agricultural {{sprayers}} {{are used}} to apply chemical treatments (pesticides and fertilizer) to crops. A sprayer distributes the chemical by employing many nozzles spaced evenly along a <b>boom</b> <b>structure</b> oriented perpendicular to the direction of travel to cover large areas with each machine pass. To maximize spray efficacy, the nozzles must be held a specific distance from the target to be sprayed. With diversification of crop types grown in Western Canada, foliar application of chemical treatments at multiple points during the plants’ life cycles are now required. This multi-growth-stage application process requires a machine with a large range of vertical adjustment; thus permitting the nozzles to be maintained the correct distance from the target (crop) as it grows. Suspended boom sprayers provide the range of adjustment required. The suspended <b>boom</b> <b>structure</b> consists of three controlled sections which are positioned via use of hydraulic actuators. To reduce the effect of terrain inputs through the carrying frame on the boom’s orientation, most suspended boom sprayers incorporate a passive suspension system to limit coupling between the carrying frame and boom. By doing this however, a negative effect is created. During typical operation, the operator will use the actuator to reorient one section thereby maintaining the desired distance from the boom to the target; the opposing section will deviate from its desired position due to coupling of the boom sections through the passive suspension system. The quantification of this problem {{was the basis for}} this research. A computer simulation model of the <b>boom</b> <b>structure,</b> passive suspension system, hydraulic actuator, and on/off type directional valve was created. Comparisons to experimental data showed the model was applicable for predicting trends in boom performance related to manipulation of actuator velocity profiles. Standardized changes in the actuated section’s orientation were used to establish the existing performance baseline and quantify the problem. Alternative commercially available directional valves (proportional and pulse width modulated) were then simulated and used in conjunction with the boom model to determine if boom performance improvements may be realized by defining the actuator’s acceleration rate during orientation changes. The proportional valve was able to limit the acceleration and deceleration of the actuated section to reduce the coupling effect and improve the non-actuated section’s performance. However, the performance of the actuated section degraded more significantly in all trials regardless of input profile. The performance degradation resulted as slower acceleration and deceleration of the actuator required an increased amount of time for the desired orientation of the actuated section to be reached. It was also concluded that performance of the dynamic orientation of the <b>boom</b> <b>structure</b> was equivalent for orientation changes driven wither by pulse width modulation of an on/off valve or a true proportional valve. The boom structure’s large inertia and low natural frequency acted as a suitable filter for the flow and pressure pulsations introduced by pulse width modulation...|$|E

40|$|Deflection {{compensation}} of flexible <b>boom</b> <b>structures</b> in robot positioning is usually done using tables containing {{the magnitude of}} the deflection with inverse kinematics solutions of a rigid structure. The number of table values increases greatly if the working area of the boom is large and the required positioning accuracy is high. The inverse kinematics problems are very nonlinear, and if the structure is redundant, in some cases it cannot be solved in a closed form. If the structural flexibility of the manipulator arms is taken into account, the problem is almost impossible to solve using analytical methods. Neural networks offer a possibility to approximate any linear or nonlinear function. This study presents four different methods of using neural networks in the static deflection compensation and inverse kinematics solution of a flexible hydraulically driven manipulator. The training information required for training neural networks is obtained by employing a simulation model that includes elasticity characteristics. The functionality of the presented methods is tested based on the simulated and measured results of positioning accuracy. The simulated positioning accuracy is tested in 25 separate coordinate points. For each point, the positioning is tested with five different mass loads. The mean positioning error of a manipulator decreased from 31. 9 mm to 4. 1 mm in the test points. This accuracy enables the use of flexible manipulators in the positioning of larger objects.
