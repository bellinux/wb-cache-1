5|$|<b>Breeds</b> {{are often}} {{categorized}} by {{the type of}} their wool. Fine wool <b>breeds</b> are those that have wool of great crimp and density, which are preferred for textiles. Most of these were derived from Merino sheep, and the breed continues to dominate the world sheep industry. Downs <b>breeds</b> have wool between the extremes, and are typically fast-growing meat and ram <b>breeds</b> with dark faces. Some major medium wool <b>breeds,</b> such as the Corriedale, are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled <b>breeds</b> and were created for high-production commercial flocks. Long wool <b>breeds</b> are the largest of sheep, with long wool and a slow rate of growth. Long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types. For example: the American Columbia breed was developed by crossing Lincoln rams (a long wool breed) with fine-wooled Rambouillet ewes.|$|E
5|$|Croatia has 38,226 known taxa, 2.8% {{of which}} are endemic; the actual number (including undiscovered species) is {{estimated}} to be between 50,000 and 100,000. The estimate is supported by nearly 400 new taxa of invertebrates discovered in Croatia in 2000–2005 alone. There are more than a thousand endemic species, especially in the Velebit and Biokovo mountains, Adriatic islands and karst rivers. Legislation protects 1,131 species. Indigenous cultivars of plants and <b>breeds</b> of domesticated animals are also numerous; they include five <b>breeds</b> of horses, five <b>breeds</b> of cattle, eight <b>breeds</b> of sheep, two <b>breeds</b> of pigs and a poultry breed. Even the indigenous <b>breeds</b> include nine endangered or critically endangered ones.|$|E
5|$|Heritage turkey <b>breeds</b> {{have been}} a focus for the {{organization}} since 1997, when a survey showed only 1,335 breeding stock birds of all <b>breeds.</b> A {{study conducted by the}} Conservancy and Virginia Tech concluded that heritage turkey <b>breeds</b> had stronger immune systems than those <b>breeds</b> typically used by industrial growers, and as such were more likely to survive disease epidemics. This study and other programs increased awareness of heritage turkey <b>breeds</b> and by 2003 the breeding population stood at 4,275 turkeys of all <b>breeds.</b> By 2007 this had grown to more than 10,000 birds and 17 <b>breeds</b> were no longer considered to be almost extinct. As of 2010, the number is estimated to be close to 15,000.|$|E
50|$|<b>Breed</b> clubs {{define the}} <b>breed</b> {{with which the}} club is {{associated}} in a document called a <b>breed</b> standard, although there may be multiple <b>breed</b> clubs for the same <b>breed,</b> each defining the <b>breed</b> in a somewhat different manner. <b>Breed</b> clubs are not scientific organisations, nor are <b>breed</b> standards meant to be scientific descriptions of a <b>breed.</b> Any fancier or group of fanciers may start a <b>breed</b> club and write definitions to suit themselves.|$|R
50|$|A <b>breed</b> {{standard}} (also called bench standard or the standard) {{in the dog}} fancy is a set {{of guidelines}} covering specific externally observable qualities such as appearance, movement, and temperament for that dog <b>breed.</b> <b>Breed</b> standards are not scientific documents, but are written for each <b>breed</b> by clubs of hobbyists called <b>breed</b> clubs for their own specific requirements. Details and definitions within <b>breed</b> standards for a specific dog <b>breed</b> may vary from <b>breed</b> club to <b>breed</b> club and from country to country. Dog <b>breed</b> standards are similar in form and function to <b>breed</b> standards for other domesticated animals.|$|R
50|$|<b>Breed</b> {{standards}} are devised by <b>breed</b> associations or <b>breed</b> clubs, not by individuals, and are written {{to reflect the}} use or purpose of the species and <b>breed</b> of the animal. <b>Breed</b> standards help define the ideal animal of a <b>breed</b> and provide goals for breeders in improving stock. In essence a <b>breed</b> standard is a blueprint for an animal fit for the function it was bred - i.e. herding, tracking etc. <b>Breed</b> {{standards are}} not scientific documents, and may vary from association to association, and from country to country, even for the same species and <b>breed.</b> There is no one format for <b>breed</b> standards across all species, and <b>breed</b> standards do change and are updated over time.|$|R
5|$|The Conservation Priority List (CPL) is the Conservancy's list of <b>breeds</b> {{for which}} {{conservation}} is a priority. Published annually, {{the list is}} used {{as the foundation for}} all conservation work done by the organization. Each year, it gathers population data on all <b>breeds</b> of livestock, including registration data and, for poultry, census numbers gathered from members, hatcheries and breeders. This data is then used to divide <b>breeds</b> into five categories: critical, threatened, watch, recovering and study. <b>Breeds</b> are placed in the first three categories based on annual registrations with breed registries in the United States and estimated global populations. Recovering <b>breeds</b> are those that have exceeded the numbers needed for the watch category but that the organization still wishes to monitor. <b>Breeds</b> in the study category lack genetic or historical documentation but are still considered to be of genetic interest. Population numbers may be lacking on these <b>breeds,</b> or proof that they are a true breed, instead of a type or non-true-breeding cross.|$|E
5|$|The USMARC study {{indicated}} that Limousins were significantly the slowest of all <b>breeds</b> to achieve market end points of two measures of marbling score (70 to 160 days longer than the British <b>breeds,</b> and 65 to 70 days longer than the other continental European <b>breeds)</b> while feed conversion efficiency based on live weight gain was marginally poorer (12% less than the British <b>breeds</b> and comparable with the other continental European <b>breeds).</b> When feed conversion efficiency is adjusted to weight of saleable meat divided by feed consumed, Limousin feed conversion efficiency then exceeds both British and continental European <b>breeds</b> by 10–25%. The USMARC study also indicated that Limousins were very significantly the slowest of all <b>breeds</b> to achieve market specifications of three measures of rib eye fat (300 to 400 days longer than the British <b>breeds,</b> and 170 to 220 days longer than the other continental European <b>breeds)</b> while feed conversion efficiency based on live weight gain was poorer (25–30% less than the British <b>breeds</b> and 12–16% less than the other continental European <b>breeds).</b> When corrected to saleable meat divided by feed consumed, feed conversion efficiency was similar or marginally better for Limousins. At these end points, Limousins finished at markedly heavier live weights (up to 490kg heavier than the British <b>breeds,</b> and 190kg heavier than the other continental European <b>breeds).</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{invasive}} algae {{are regularly}} monitored and removed {{to protect the}} benthic habitat. Indigenous sorts of cultivated plants and <b>breeds</b> of domesticated animals are also numerous. Those include five <b>breeds</b> of horses, five <b>breeds</b> of cattle, eight <b>breeds</b> of sheep, two <b>breeds</b> of pigs and a poultry breed. Even the indigenous <b>breeds</b> include nine endangered or critically endangered ones.|$|E
50|$|In general, <b>breed</b> {{clubs and}} {{associations}} create a written {{definition of the}} <b>breed</b> (called a <b>breed</b> standard) for the <b>breed</b> with which the organization is associated. <b>Breed</b> clubs also maintain important records, and provide members with information. Many <b>breed</b> associations also have a social component, organising various activities such as shows. In addition, they may regulate breeding or raise funds for research related to the <b>breed.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{conformation}} show, {{also referred}} to as a <b>breed</b> show, is a kind of dog show in which a judge familiar with a specific dog <b>breed</b> evaluates individual purebred dogs for how well the dogs conform to the established <b>breed</b> type for their <b>breed,</b> as described in a <b>breed's</b> individual <b>breed</b> standard.|$|R
50|$|A <b>breed</b> {{that is not}} {{recognised}} by a {{kennel club}} means {{that it has not}} been sufficiently vetted according to that particular kennel club's rules. It {{does not mean that the}} <b>breed</b> is not a <b>breed.</b> A kennel club usually requires a <b>breed</b> to have a large enough <b>breed</b> club to warrant the training of judges for the <b>breed,</b> as well as a specific amount of documentation, to accept a <b>breed.</b>|$|R
5|$|A last {{group of}} sheep <b>breeds</b> {{is that of}} fur or hair sheep, which do not grow wool at all. Hair sheep {{are similar to the}} early domesticated sheep kept before woolly <b>breeds</b> were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts. Some modern <b>breeds</b> of hair sheep, such as the Dorper, result from crosses between wool and hair <b>breeds.</b> For meat and hide producers, hair sheep are cheaper to keep, as they do not need shearing. Hair sheep are also more {{resistant}} to parasites and hot weather.|$|E
5|$|A minor {{class of}} sheep are the dairy <b>breeds.</b> Dual-purpose <b>breeds</b> that may {{primarily}} be meat or wool sheep {{are often used}} secondarily as milking animals, {{but there are a}} few <b>breeds</b> that are predominantly used for milking. These sheep produce a higher quantity of milk and have slightly longer lactation curves. In the quality of their milk, the fat and protein content percentages of dairy sheep vary from non-dairy <b>breeds,</b> but lactose content does not.|$|E
5|$|As of 2011, {{there are}} 33 horse <b>breeds</b> on the equine CPL, {{comprising}} seventeen {{in the critical}} category, seven in the threatened, five in the watch, three in the recovering and one in study. There are also three <b>breeds</b> of asses, one {{in each of the}} critical, threatened and recovering categories. On the CPL for all other livestock species there are 10 pig breeds: seven in the critical category, one threatened, one watched, and one in the study. The 19 cattle <b>breeds</b> listed include eight in the critical category, two in the threatened, three in the watch, five recovering and one in the study. The list contains 23 sheep breeds: five in the critical category, six in the threatened, three in the watch, eight in the recovering and one in the study. Of seven goat <b>breeds</b> listed, two are in the critical category, two in the watch, two recovering and one in the study. Finally, there are 11 rabbit <b>breeds</b> listed on the CPL: three in the critical category, three threatened, and five in the watch.|$|E
50|$|<b>Breed</b> clubs provide {{information}} to the public about their <b>breed.</b> Club members agree to a code of ethics overseen by the club and a list of breeders is usually available to help people find a reputable breeder. <b>Breed</b> clubs also sponsor dog shows for their <b>breed,</b> hunting trials for their <b>breed,</b> and other events related to their particular <b>breed.</b>|$|R
25|$|A <b>breed</b> {{that is not}} {{recognised}} by a {{kennel club}} means {{that it has not}} been sufficiently vetted according to that particular kennel club's rules. It {{does not mean that the}} <b>breed</b> is not a <b>breed.</b> Major kennel clubs usually require a <b>breed</b> to have a specific amount of documentation, as well as a large enough <b>breed</b> club to warrant the training of judges for the <b>breed,</b> for the <b>breed</b> to be accepted.|$|R

5|$|B. g. pallidiceps (Reichenow, 1908): <b>breeds</b> {{in northwestern}} North America.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{influence}} of the later Habsburg families, who ruled in both Spain and other nations of Europe, the Andalusian was crossbred with horses of Central Europe and the Low Countries and thus was closely related to many <b>breeds</b> that developed, including the Neapolitan horse, Groningen, Lipizzaner and Kladruber. Spanish horses have been used extensively in classical dressage in Germany since the 16th century. They thus influenced many German <b>breeds,</b> including the Hanoverian, Holstein, East Friesian and Oldenburg. Dutch <b>breeds</b> such as the Friesian and Gelderland also contain significant Spanish blood, as do Danish <b>breeds</b> such as the Fredericksborg and Knabstrupper.|$|E
5|$|Coarse or {{carpet wool}} sheep are {{those with a}} medium to long length wool of {{characteristic}} coarseness. <b>Breeds</b> traditionally used for carpet wool show great variability, but the chief requirement is a wool that will not break down under heavy use (as would that of the finer <b>breeds).</b> As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders {{of this type of}} sheep are attempting to use a few of these traditional <b>breeds</b> for alternative purposes. Others have always been primarily meat-class sheep.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Breed</b> type {{encompasses}} appearance, character, condition, bone structure, temperament, and movement; [...] "breed type is {{all these}} things." [...] <b>Breed</b> type {{also includes a}} character specific to each <b>breed,</b> a combination of behaviour, temperament and carriage that demonstrate an essence of the <b>breed.</b> [...] "He exuded <b>breed</b> type," [...] writes Anne Marie Rasmussen of a particular King Charles Spaniel. An Akbash Dog [...] "with correct <b>breed</b> type is confident, protective, intelligent, brave, affectionate yet reserved, and always loyal." [...] The exact definition of <b>breed</b> type for any given <b>breed</b> can be very subjective and elusive.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>breed</b> {{standard}} for each <b>breed</b> of dog is distinct, giving a detailed [...] "word picture" [...] of the appearance and behaviour of an idealized dog of that <b>breed.</b> Included in the <b>breed</b> standard description are externally observable aspects of appearance and behaviour {{that are considered}} by the <b>breed</b> club {{to be the most}} important for the <b>breed,</b> and externally observable details of appearance or temperament that are considered by the <b>breed</b> club to be unacceptable (called faults). In addition most <b>breed</b> standards include an historical section, describing the place of origin and the original work done by the <b>breed</b> or its ancestor types.|$|R
5000|$|Dog <b>breed</b> clubs {{exist to}} [...] "support the {{preservation}} and protection" [...] of the club's <b>breed.</b> Each club defines for itself what exactly the club {{will do for}} the <b>breed,</b> depending {{on the use of}} the particular <b>breed</b> that is advocated by the <b>breed</b> club.|$|R
5|$|DNA {{studies have}} {{identified}} close genetic relationships between Limousin cattle and other south-west European <b>breeds.</b> One study reported a possible common origin or recent gene flow between the Limousin and Charolais cattle <b>breeds.</b> whereas other studies {{indicated that a}} closer genetic relationship exists between Limousin, Gasconne, Aubrac, Bazadais, Salers, and Blonde d'Aquitaine cattle.|$|E
5|$|Domesticated {{guinea pigs}} occur in many <b>breeds,</b> {{which have been}} {{developed}} since their introduction to Europe and North America. These varieties vary in hair and color composition. The most common varieties found in pet stores are the English shorthair (also known as the American), which have a short, smooth coat, and the Abyssinian, whose coat is ruffled with cowlicks, or rosettes. Also popular among breeders are the Peruvian and the Sheltie (or Silkie), both straight longhair <b>breeds,</b> and the Texel, a curly longhair. Grooming of guinea pigs is primarily accomplished using combs or brushes. Shorthair <b>breeds</b> are typically brushed weekly, while longhair <b>breeds</b> may require daily grooming.|$|E
5|$|Fox Terriers are two {{different}} <b>breeds</b> of the terrier dog type: the Smooth Fox Terrier and the Wire Fox Terrier. Both of these <b>breeds</b> originated in the 19th century {{from a handful of}} dogs who are descended from earlier varieties of British terriers, and are related to other modern white terrier <b>breeds.</b> In addition, a number of <b>breeds</b> have diverged from these two main types of fox terrier and have been recognised separately, including the Jack Russell Terrier, Miniature Fox Terrier and Rat Terrier. The Wire and Smooth Fox Terriers share similar characteristics, the main differences being in the coat and markings. They have been successful in conformation shows, more prominently in America than their homeland.|$|E
50|$|The Chilean horse or Chilean Corralero is a horse <b>breed</b> from South America. It is {{the oldest}} {{registered}} native American <b>breed,</b> the oldest registered <b>breed</b> of Iberian origin, the oldest registered horse <b>breed</b> in South America and the oldest registered stock horse <b>breed</b> in the Western Hemisphere.|$|R
50|$|<b>Breed</b> {{standards}} are written by individual <b>breed</b> clubs, and, if the <b>breed</b> club {{is a member}} of a national kennel club, the standard will go through a process of being approved by the national kennel club so that the members of the <b>breed</b> club can take part in the dog activities sponsored by the national kennel club. The national kennel club only directs the form of the <b>breed</b> standard, the <b>breed</b> standard itself is written by the <b>breed</b> club or clubs.|$|R
5000|$|In general, when a {{newly created}} [...] "rare" [...] <b>breed</b> or newly rediscovered {{landrace}} or natural <b>breed</b> becomes popular enough, groups of breeders will join {{together in a}} club or association, and write a <b>breed</b> standard for their <b>breed.</b> In the standard the club members will define the <b>breed's</b> eternally observable appearance, often in great detail. The standard may also include the <b>breed's</b> observable temperament, and some history of the <b>breed.</b> If members of the <b>breed</b> wish to join a national kennel club, they will write the standard using the national kennel club's format, and will go through an application process (see the Affiliation or independence? section below.) The <b>breed</b> club will obtain or compile the stud book for their <b>breed,</b> which details the descent of all known members of the <b>breed.</b> In addition, members will usually create {{a code of ethics}} that will specify details of breeding requirements for member-breeders (although {{there is no way to}} make such an ethical code binding on non-members.) ...|$|R
5|$|In 1955 the Howitt {{report on}} the {{development}} of pig production in the United Kingdom was published. Its main conclusions were that UK pig farms were poorly placed to compete with European producers, that the diversity of local <b>breeds</b> in the UK was an obstacle to progress, and that British pig farmers should focus on three <b>breeds</b> only: the Welsh, the British Landrace, and the Large White. The report initiated a period of decline in all other British pig <b>breeds,</b> including the Large Black. By the time the Rare <b>Breeds</b> Survival Trust was founded 1973, numbers of all traditional pig <b>breeds</b> were dangerously low, and many of them were extinct. The Large Black was placed on the Trust's endangered list.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 the Conservancy {{partnered with}} Slow Food USA and other {{organizations}} to conduct a blind taste test of nine <b>breeds</b> of turkeys– eight heritage <b>breeds</b> and one standard industrially grown breed. When the final scores were read, first place went to the Midget White Turkey, second to the Bourbon Red and last place to the Butterball– the single non-heritage breed. This was the largest taste test among turkey <b>breeds</b> to date, {{and several of the}} heritage <b>breeds</b> were later added to the Slow Food USA Ark of Taste.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a {{study which}} used {{endogenous}} retrovirus markers {{to investigate the}} history of sheep domestication found the Jacob to be more closely linked to sheep from Africa and South-west Asia than to other British <b>breeds,</b> though all domestic <b>breeds</b> {{can be traced back}} to an origin the Fertile Crescent.|$|E
50|$|Membership in a <b>breed</b> club {{is usually}} done through an application, {{in which the}} {{prospective}} member explains his or her interest in the <b>breed,</b> and supplies recommendations from other members. Most individuals join <b>breed</b> clubs in order {{to participate in the}} club-sponsored activities. Hobby breeders join <b>breed</b> clubs for access to records and information about the <b>breed,</b> and sign the <b>breed</b> club's code of ethics in order to provide puppy buyers with some assurance {{of the quality of the}} puppies from members of the club. However, the <b>breed</b> club has no control over the practices of individuals who are not members of the <b>breed</b> club.|$|R
50|$|The Deutsche Bracke (German Bracke, {{also called}} the German Hound, Fédération Cynologique Internationale <b>breed</b> number 299) is another <b>breed</b> of Bracke, the first one {{registered}} as a separate <b>breed,</b> in 1900. The Alpenländische Dachsbracke (Alpine Dachsbracke, <b>breed</b> number 254) is from Tyrol, in Austria. The Drever, <b>breed</b> number 130, is {{also called the}} Swedish Dachsbracke.|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, it was {{expensive}} {{and difficult to}} locate and import Siberians. Therefore, inbreeding became common. Because the <b>breed</b> is relatively new to registration and <b>breed</b> books are open, breeders are able to add foundation stock to the <b>breed.</b> This reduces the level of relatedness within the <b>breed,</b> and increases vigor in the <b>breed.</b>|$|R
