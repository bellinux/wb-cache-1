5|$|The crab-plover {{is related}} to the waders, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only member of its family. It resembles a plover but has very long grey legs and a strong black bill similar to that of a tern. It has {{black-and-white}} plumage, a long neck, partially webbed feet and a bill designed for eating crabs.|$|E
5|$|The reverence due to {{writings}} {{that have}} long subsisted arises therefore not from any credulous confidence in the superior wisdom of past ages, or gloomy persuasion of the degeneracy of mankind, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> consequence of acknowledged and indubitable positions, that what has been longest known has been most considered, and what is most considered is best understood.|$|E
5|$|A History of British Birds, Bewick's great {{achievement}} and with which {{his name is}} inseparably associated, was published in two volumes: History and Description of Land Birds in 1797 and History and Description of Water Birds in 1804, with a supplement in 1821. The Birds is specifically British, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> forerunner of all modern field guides. Bewick was helped by his intimate knowledge of the habits of animals acquired during his frequent excursions into the country. He also recounts information passed to him by acquaintances and local gentry, and that obtained in natural history works of his time, including those by Thomas Pennant and Gilbert White, {{as well as the}} translation of Buffon's Histoire naturelle.|$|E

5|$|Each {{heavy chain}} has two regions, the {{constant}} {{region and the}} variable region. The constant region is identical in all antibodies of the same isotype, but differs in antibodies of different isotypes. Heavy chains γ, α and δ have a constant region composed of three tandem (in a line) Ig domains, and a hinge region for added flexibility; heavy chains μ and ε have a constant region composed of four immunoglobulin domains. The variable region of the heavy chain differs in antibodies produced by different B cells, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> same for all antibodies produced by a single B cell or B cell clone. The variable region of each heavy chain is approximately 110 amino acids long and is composed of a single Ig domain.|$|E
5|$|Megatron sends Starscream, and {{his twin}} {{brothers}} Thundercracker and Skywarp to reactivate an Energon bridge which will feed the station with raw Energon, allowing the manufacturing of more Dark Energon. Once they succeed, Megatron then develops {{a plan to}} infect the core of Cybertron with Dark Energon, feeling that he can {{gain control of the}} planet once it is infected. He launches a full-scale assault on the Autobot capital city of Iacon, looking for an item called the Omega Key, which he will use to enter Cybertron's core and infect it. The Decepticons learn that Zeta Prime has placed the key under his personal guard. Megatron's forces enter the chambers of Zeta Prime and defeat him in battle. Zeta Prime tells Megatron that the Omega Key is not actually what unlocks access to the core, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> means to activate the true key, a colossal Transformer known as Omega Supreme. After hearing this, Megatron presumably kills Zeta Prime.|$|E
5|$|The Intercontinental Championship {{has been}} called the second most {{important}} championship in the company, after the WWE Championship. It has been active in WWE for the second longest period, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> third oldest active title, behind the WWE Championship (1963) and the United States Championship (1975), the latter of which was acquired from World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 2001. In 2002, the WWF was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), and the championship was renamed as the WWE Intercontinental Championship. As a result of the 2017 WWE Superstar Shake-up, it is exclusively contested on the Raw brand.|$|E

25|$|The {{calving rate}} is largely {{controlled}} by {{the depth of the}} water and the glacier velocity at the calving front.
