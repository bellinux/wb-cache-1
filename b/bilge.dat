5|$|The {{original}} {{design of the}} Indiana class included <b>bilge</b> keels, but with keels they would not fit {{in any of the}} American drydocks at the time, so they were omitted during construction. This meant a reduction in stability and caused a serious problem for Indiana, when both main turrets broke loose from their clamps in heavy seas a year after being commissioned. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced, they swung from side to side with the motion of the ship, until they were secured with heavy ropes. When the ship encountered more bad weather four months later, she promptly steamed back to port for fear the clamps would break again. This convinced the navy that <b>bilge</b> keels were necessary and they were subsequently installed on all three ships.|$|E
5|$|After {{the ship}} arrived in Invergordon, Baden was {{carefully}} examined by Royal Navy technicians. Naval engineers inspected the hull, including the screws, <b>bilge</b> keels, and rudders, {{to determine the}} water resistance of the hull form. The ship {{was found to have}} been approximately as efficient as the British s. The ship's armor system was extensively investigated; the British team concluded that the ship had not been modified to incorporate the lessons from the Battle of Jutland of 31 May– 1 June 1916.|$|E
5|$|Captain Salmond rushed on {{deck and}} ordered the anchor to be dropped, the quarter-boats to be lowered, and a turn astern to be given by the engines. However, as the ship backed off the rock, the sea rushed into the large hole made by the {{collision}} and the ship struck again, buckling the plates of the forward <b>bilge</b> and ripping open the bulkheads. Shortly, the forward compartments and the engine rooms were flooded, and over 100 soldiers were drowned in their berths.|$|E
40|$|Hydrostatic bulging forming {{combined}} with axial compression {{is a new}} method for producing vessels or containers proposed recently by Woo et al. In this process a deep cup is first formed from a circular sheet metal blank by drawing and ironing, and then bulged under internal hydraulic pressure and axial compression. This paper investigates the following problems;　 1) Why the axial compression is effective on <b>bilging.</b> 　 2) What loading path is the most effective. 　 3) What the <b>bilging</b> limit depends on if it exists. 　Freely <b>bilging</b> formings without outer die were carried out up to the <b>bilging</b> limit (buckling or rupture). The experiments on aluminum sheets showed that the maximum <b>bilging</b> strain was 64 % (greater than the result by Woo) and that the <b>bilging</b> limit was not caused by rupture but by depression at the shoulder of a vessel...|$|R

5|$|Tang dynasty (618–907) {{emperors}} gave princesses {{in marriage}} to {{rulers of the}} Uyghur Khaganate to consolidate the special trade and military relationship that developed after the Khaganate supported the Chinese during the An Lushan Rebellion. At least three Tang imperial princesses {{are known to have}} married khagans between 758 and 821. These unions temporarily stopped in 788, which is believed in part to be because stability within the Chinese empire meant that they were politically unnecessary; however, threats from Tibet in the west, and a renewed need for Uyghur support, precipitated the marriage of Princess Taihe to <b>Bilge</b> Khagan.|$|E
5|$|The {{four-bladed}} propeller {{was replaced}} by a slightly smaller three-bladed model, and the <b>bilge</b> keels, previously added to reduce the tendency to roll, were replaced by a heavy external oak keel for the same purpose. The five-masted schooner sail-plan {{was replaced by}} four masts, two of which were square-rigged. With the refit complete, Great Britain went back into service on the New York run. After only one further round trip she was sold again, to Antony Gibbs & Sons, which planned to place her into England-Australia service.|$|E
5|$|The {{water was}} pumped {{out through the}} joint efforts of a local fire company and the shipyard, and Prince of Wales was later dry docked for {{permanent}} repairs. This damage and {{the problem with the}} delivery of her main guns and turrets delayed her completion. As the war progressed there was an urgent need for capital ships, and so her completion was advanced by postponing compartment air tests, ventilation tests and a thorough testing of her <b>bilge,</b> ballast and fuel-oil systems.|$|E

40|$|Scantling {{and rolling}} {{tolerances}} have gradually improved. The durability of anticorrosive property of coatings {{is the critical}} factor in safeguarding the capital investment locked up {{in the structure of}} the vessel. Understanding of reduction in corrosion rate due to protective coatings and the breakdown point of the coatings is a vital part of safe vessel operation. In this paper, surface morphology of paint scheme used in <b>bilges</b> water, is measured by using both optical and AFM (Atomic Force Microscope) to prevent corrosion. Both the strategies are utilized to study natural practices of diverse coatings in addition to the impact of their film development and shades. The results demonstrate that undercoat epoxy utilized within <b>bilges</b> water has great resistance towards corrosion in <b>bilges</b> water immersion test. Surface attributes of distinctive layers are noticeably unique in relation to one another in surface morphology. Mild steel coated with epoxy under coat shows better surface characteristics whereas film of primer epoxy coat has many pits as observed by percentage surface imaging of the current <b>bilges</b> paint scheme...|$|R
5|$|As designed, {{the ships}} did not handle {{particularly}} well, even in calm seas, and their motion was quite stiff. The ships experienced severe rolling, {{due to the}} weight of the wing turrets. The heavy wing turrets caused the ships to have a large metacentric height, which should have made them very stable gun platforms, but their roll period proved to coincide with that of the average North Sea swell. <b>Bilge</b> keels were later added, which helped to improve the rolling problem. Despite the tendency to roll, the Nassau-class ships were maneuverable and had a small turning radius. They suffered minor speed loss in heavy seas, but up to 70percent at hard rudder. The roll keels that had been fitted to improve handling caused a portion of the speed loss at hard rudder.|$|E
5|$|Barges {{were also}} used to {{transport}} ice, particularly along the Hudson River, doubling on occasion as storage units as well. These barges could carry between 400 and 800 tons (400,000 to 800,000kg) of ice and, like ice carrying ships, windmills were typically installed to power the barge's <b>bilge</b> pumps. Barges were believed to help preserve ice from melting, as the ice was stored beneath the deck and insulated by the river. Charlie Morse introduced larger, seagoing ice barges in the 1890s in order to supply New York; these were pulled by schooners and could each carry up to 3,000 tons (three million kg) of ice.|$|E
5|$|During early August 1940, {{while she}} was still being {{outfitted}} and was in a semi-complete state, Prince of Wales was attacked by German aircraft. One bomb fell between the ship and a wet basin wall, narrowly missing a 100-ton dockside crane, and exploded underwater below the <b>bilge</b> keel. The explosion took place about six feet from the ship's port side {{in the vicinity of the}} after group of 5.25-inch guns. Buckling of the shell plating took place over a distance of 20 to , rivets were sprung and considerable flooding took place in the port outboard compartments in the area of damage, causing a ten-degree port list. The flooding was severe, due to the fact that final compartment air tests had not yet been made and the ship did not have her pumping system in operation.|$|E

5|$|Frahm {{anti-roll}} {{tanks were}} fitted during construction, but these {{proved to be}} ineffective; the tanks only reduced rolling by 33%. <b>Bilge</b> keels were later added to improve stability, and the space previously used for the anti-roll tanks was instead used as extra fuel storage. The ship was able to carry an additional 180 t(200 short tons) of coal in the anti-roll tanks. Von der Tanns hull consisted of 15 watertight compartments, and a double bottom extended for 75% of the ship's length. The ship was known to have good maneuvering characteristics, with a speed loss of 60% and a heel of 8degrees at full rudder.|$|E
5|$|Yeşilçam is the sobriquet that {{refers to}} the Turkish film art and industry. The first movie {{exhibited}} in the Ottoman Empire was the Lumiere Brothers' 1895 film, L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat, which was shown in Istanbul in 1896. The first Turkish-made film was a documentary entitled Ayastefanos'taki Rus Abidesinin Yıkılışı (Demolition of the Russian Monument at San Stefano), directed by Fuat Uzkınay and completed in 1914. The first narrative film, Sedat Simavi's The Spy, was released in 1917. Turkey's first sound film was shown in 1931. Turkish directors like Ferzan Özpetek, Nuri <b>Bilge</b> Ceylan and Yılmaz Güney won numerous international awards such as Palme d'Or and Golden Bear.|$|E
5|$|About 12,500 {{species of}} insects are native to Florida, {{most of which}} {{naturally}} flew into the region from the Caribbean or Southeastern United States. An additional 1,000 {{have been identified as}} exotic. Insects create about $1 billion of damage to structures and agriculture in Florida each year. The tide of arriving insects is nearly impossible to control with the volume of goods and shipments coming into South Florida. Imported citrus is a major avenue for damaging insects. Twenty-one species have been imported and released to act as biological control agents: to impede the growth of invasive plants or counter the effects of other insects. Others, such as the Madagascan hissing cockroach (Gromphadorhina portentosa) and European cricket (Acheta domesticus) are sold as pets or fishing bait, and are then released into backyards. Similarly, aquatic invertebrates such as mussels, clams, snails, and melania find their ways into local waters from the bottoms of ships or in <b>bilge</b> holds. The aquarium trade also supplies enthusiasts with exotic species which are dumped or escape into waterways.|$|E

5|$|Indiana was {{commissioned}} on 20 November 1895 {{under the command}} of Captain Robley D. Evans. After further trials, the ship joined the North Atlantic Squadron {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Francis M. Bunce, which conducted training exercises along the East Coast of the United States. In late 1896, both main turrets broke loose from their clamps in heavy seas. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced, they swung from side to side with the motion of the ship, until they were secured with heavy ropes. Heavier clamps were installed, but in February 1896, while conducting fleet maneuvers with the North Atlantic squadron, the Indiana encountered more bad weather and started rolling heavily. Her new captain, Henry Clay Taylor, promptly ordered her back to port for fear the clamps would break again. This convinced the navy that <b>bilge</b> keels—omitted during construction because, with them, the ship could not fit in most American dry docks—were necessary to reduce the rolling, and they were subsequently installed on all three ships of the Indiana-class.|$|E
5|$|Kentuckian resumed cargo {{service with}} American-Hawaiian after her return from World War I service. Though {{the company had}} {{abandoned}} its original Hawaiian sugar routes by this time, Kentuckian continued inter-coastal service through the Panama Canal with a few incidents that interrupted what was a mostly uneventful twenty years. In September 1928, a day after sailing from San Francisco, Kentuckian was rammed by the General Petroleum tanker Los Alamos near Point Sur, California, in a thick fog. Kentuckian had a leak in her number two cargo hold and damage to her port <b>bilge</b> keel and returned to San Francisco for repairs. In early April 1933, a fire broke out in Kentuckians number two cargo hold, {{which resulted in the}} delay of the ship at Panama from 8 to 14 April. Kentuckian made her way to Los Angeles over the next ten days, where surveyors examined the ship and her general cargo.|$|E
5|$|On October 16, {{with the}} ship's coal stores running low, Captain Budington {{decided to run}} the Polaris aground near Etah. Having lost much of their bedding, clothing, and food when it was haphazardly jettisoned from the ship on October 12, the {{remaining}} 14 men were in poor condition to face another winter. They built a hut from lumber salvaged from the ship, and on October 24, extinguished the ship's boilers to conserve coal. The <b>bilge</b> pumps stopped for good, and the ship heeled over on her side, half out of water. Fortunately, the Etah Inuit helped the men survive the winter. After wintering ashore, the crew built two boats from salvaged wood from the ship, and on June 3 the crew sailed south. They were spotted and rescued in July by the whaler Ravenscraig, and returned home via Scotland.|$|E

50|$|On 14 September 1953, Yakutat {{performed}} emergency repairs by {{constructing a}} concrete bulkhead aboard and pumping the <b>bilges</b> of the Spanish merchant ship Marte, {{which had a}} large hole at the waterline, about 750 nmi km southeast of Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland, Canada.|$|R
5|$|Ships {{carrying}} ice {{needed to}} be particularly strong {{and there was a}} premium placed on recruiting good crews, able to move the cargo quickly to its location before it melted. By the end of the 19th century, the preferred choice was a wooden-hulled vessel, to avoid rust corrosion from the melting ice, while windmill pumps were installed to remove the excess water from the hull using <b>bilge</b> pumps. Ice cargoes tended to cause damage to ships in the longer term, as the constant melting of the ice and the resulting water and steam encouraged dry rot. Shipment sizes varied; depending on the ports and route. The typical late 19th century U.S. vessel was a schooner, carrying around 600 tons (500,000kg) of ice; a large shipment from Norway to England might include up to 900 tons (800,000kg).|$|E
5|$|The hull {{had four}} levels {{separated}} by three decks. The terminology for {{these in the}} 16th century was still not standardised so the terms used here are those that were applied by the Mary Rose Trust. The hold lay furthest down in the ship, right above the bottom planking below the waterline. This is where the kitchen, or galley, was situated and the food was cooked. Directly aft of the galley was the mast step, a rebate in the centre-most timber of the keelson, right above the keel, which supported the main mast, and next to it the main <b>bilge</b> pump. To increase {{the stability of the}} ship, the hold was where the ballast was placed and much of the supplies were kept. Right above the hold was the orlop, the lowest deck. Like the hold it was partitioned and was also used as a storage area for everything from food to spare sails.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{transferred}} to the Ministry of War Transport, which renamed her Empire Simba and assigned Andrew Weir & Co. of London to manage her. After spending six weeks at Methil, where she had an advanced ship degaussing system installed among other repairs, Empire Simba proceeded to Oban via Lyness in mid November. She set out for North America in Convoy OB-253 on 2 December. Four days out, heavy weather dispersed the convoy, and Empire Simba proceeded independently. The ship continued to take a beating from heavy seas which opened the number one cargo hold to the ocean. Because the water was coming in faster than the <b>bilge</b> pumps in the hold number one could pump, the crew cut through the bulkheads into cargo hold number two to double the pumping capacity and were able to keep the ship under control long enough to arrive in Bermuda on 26 December. After temporary repairs were made there, Empire Simba sailed on 6 January 1942 first to Halifax and then to Baltimore for more permanent repairs.|$|E
