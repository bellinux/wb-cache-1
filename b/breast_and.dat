50|$|Estrogens have a {{significant}} impact on a female's body shape. They are produced in both men and women, but their levels are significantly higher in women, especially in those of reproductive age. Besides other functions, estrogens promote the development of female secondary sexual characteristics, such as <b>breasts</b> <b>and</b> hips. As a result of estrogens, during puberty, girls develop <b>breasts</b> <b>and</b> their hips widen. Working against estrogen, the presence of testosterone in a pubescent female inhibits <b>breast</b> development <b>and</b> promotes muscle development.|$|R

HSP90, alongside other conserved chaperones and co-chaperones that interact to safeguard proteostasis, is repressed in aging human brains. This repression was found to be further exacerbated in the brains of patients with age-onset neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Huntington's disease.|$|E

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study addressed the research question, {{what are the}} perspectives and experiences related to <b>breast</b> cancer <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> cancer screening of African American women residing in rural eastern North Carolina? A literature review indicated little research related to the perceptions and experiences of rural African American women about <b>breast</b> cancer <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> cancer screening. In a previously conducted unpublished larger study (Burke, Barrett, & Cherry, 2009), the perspectives of women from rural North Carolina about <b>breast</b> cancer <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> cancer screening were collected by means of focus group interviews. The researcher {{in the present study}} conducted a qualitative analysis of data from a sub-set of focus group interviews that involved African American women. A qualitative approach in this study afforded an opportunity to gain insight into African American women's experiences <b>and</b> views regarding <b>breast</b> cancer <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> cancer screening. The researcher analyzed transcripts from three focus group interviews that involved 17 African American women residing in rural eastern North Carolina. Five themes that emerged from the data were: knowledge <b>and</b> beliefs about <b>breast</b> cancer, influences on breast cancer screening behaviors, personal experience with screening, emotional reactions to discussing <b>breast</b> cancer <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> cancer screening, <b>and</b> promoting <b>breast</b> cancer screening. Key findings related to these emergent themes included a self-perceived low level of knowledge about breast cancer, cultural views about various causes of breast cancer, perspectives about mammograms, perceived barriers to breast cancer screening, the influence of faith on <b>breast</b> cancer <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> cancer screening, personal experiences with breast cancer screening, fear as a commonly shared reaction to <b>breast</b> cancer <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> cancer screening, <b>and</b> best practices for promoting <b>breast</b> cancer awareness <b>and</b> education. The researcher identified a need for future research on the topic of minority health in rural populations, specifically around <b>breast</b> cancer screenings <b>and</b> preventive health. An analysis of a sub-set of qualitative data provided by African American women and a comparison of findings with the research literature led the researcher to recommend that tailored health education be provided African American women on the topic of <b>breast</b> cancer <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> cancer screening.

A recent study has demonstrated that endometrial tissue is characterized by higher levels of cadmium in current and former smoking females.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} is much larger, paler and longer-tailed than the {{sympatric}} song thrush. In the western Himalayas {{it could be}} confused with both the plain-backed and the long-tailed thrushes. These {{are similar to the}} mistle thrush, but the plain–backed thrush lacks obvious wing bars, is more rufous above than its relative, and is barred rather than spotted below. The long-tailed thrush has olive-toned upperparts, bars on its <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> two wing bars. Juvenile mistle thrushes are superficially similar to White's thrush, but that species has golden-yellow plumage, scalloped underparts and a distinctive underwing pattern.|$|E
40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the most common {{malignancy}} in women and early detection is important for its successful treatment. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the sensitivity and specificity of three methods for early detection of breast cancer: breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), digital mammography, <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> tomosynthesis in comparison to histopathology, as well as to investigate the intraindividual variability between these modalities.   We included 57 breast lesions, each detected by three diagnostic modalities: digital mammography, <b>breast</b> MRI, <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> tomosynthesis, <b>and</b> subsequently confirmed by histopathology. <b>Breast</b> Imaging-Reporting <b>and</b> Data System (BI-RADS) was used for characterizing the lesions. One experienced radiologist interpreted all three diagnostic modalities. Twenty-nine of the breast lesions were malignant while 28 were benign. The sensitivity for digital mammography, <b>breast</b> MRI, <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> tomosynthesis, was 72. 4 %, 93. 1 %, and 100 %, respectively; while the specificity was 46. 4 %, 60. 7 %, and 75 %, respectively. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis showed an overall diagnostic advantage of breast tomosynthesis over both <b>breast</b> MRI <b>and</b> digital mammography. The difference in performance between <b>breast</b> tomosynthesis <b>and</b> digital mammography was significant (p < 0. 001), while the difference between <b>breast</b> tomosynthesis <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> MRI was not significant (p = 0. 20).  </p...|$|R

5|$|The {{scaly-breasted munia}} or spotted munia (Lonchura punctulata), {{known in the}} pet trade as nutmeg mannikin or spice finch, is a sparrow-sized estrildid finch native to {{tropical}} Asia. A species of the genus Lonchura, it was formally described and named by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Its name {{is based on the}} distinct scale-like feather markings on the <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> belly. The adult is brown above and has a dark conical bill. The species has 11 subspecies across their range and differ slightly in size and colour.|$|E
5|$|The sexes are similar, but {{the female}} {{tends to be}} duller than the male, with a brown tint to the head, brown upperparts and less bright underparts.
