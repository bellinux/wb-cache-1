50|$|Interest in paleolimnology {{eventually}} {{shifted from}} esoteric questions of lake ontogeny to applied investigations of human impact. Torgny Wiederholm and Bill Warwick, for example, used chironomid fossils {{to assess the}} impacts of increased nutrient loading (anthropogenic eutrophication) on lake communities.

40|$|Lake Miseno is {{a coastal}} {{volcanic}} {{lake in the}} Campi Flegrei. It has only one outlet, the flow of which is limited. When the sea waters penetrate in the lake, they oxygenate only the surface zone. The lake is greatly altered {{by the lack of}} oxygen and it is polluted by effluent sewage of neighbouring built-up areas. The bottom of the lake is completely covered by a muddy layer. The present investigation has been performed to characterize the structure of animal populations living in Lake Miseno in order to highlight the capacity of surviving in such an ecosystem. Sampling has been made in six stations. Superficial benthonic <b>fauna</b> from mixed <b>bottom</b> and benthonic <b>fauna</b> from essentially muddy substratum have been drawn.

40|$|Limnological {{conditions}} were studied in two Newfoundland ponds having areas of 16 and 21 acres, and mean depths of 4. 7 and 5. 6 feet. The water was slightly acid in each {{and there was}} no dissolved oxygen deficiency; both are eutrophic and lie in an area of sedimentary rock. Rooted aquatic vegetation was not a major feature. The ponds are continuously stocked with rainbow trout and it is the most abundant of the three species of fish present. Numerically dominant bottom organisms were amphipods, dipteran larvae, sphaeriid clams, and amnicolid snails, while gravimetric analysis indicated the dominance of anisopteran nymphs. Seasonal variations in the <b>bottom</b> <b>faunae</b> were also studied. One pond has been fertilized experimentally and it revealed a standing crop of benthic organisms (46. 0 kilograms per hectare) which tripled that of the control pond. Rainbow trout in one pond were feeding on a variety of bottom organisms while those in the other fed more intensely on a less varied diet of zooplankton. Seasonal differences in food consumption were studied along with the utilization of benthic organisms by the fish. Food preference was briefly discussed. Angler catch in one pond was shown to have a tendency to vary inversely with the amount of food available in the environment and that present in the stomachs of the rainbow trout...|$|R
5000|$|During {{times of}} high sea-level (transgressive phases = slight <b>bottom</b> currents) Sowerbyceras <b>faunas</b> {{decreased}} in numbers, and were smaller, {{with a lower}} thickness ratio Wb/D (whorl breadth/Diameter) and a more evolute conch. During times of low sea-level (regressive phases = higher bottom currents) there {{is an increase in}} frequency of Sowerbyceras, which were larger, with a greater t.r.

50|$|Samples of <b>bottom</b> <b>fauna</b> {{near the}} palace in 1994 {{documented}} {{an abundance of}} species of Oligochaeta, including a new species, Fridirica ulrikae. Rake samples in 1998 documented {{more than a hundred}} species, a biodiversity explained by the oxygen feed produced by increased water flow that year, most of whom were insensitive to pollution. Two species considered Near Threatened were also documented (the caddisfhly Trichoeochiton fagessi and the freshwater gastropod Aplexa hypnorum).|$|E
50|$|Shore {{habitats}} {{are under}} particular pressure from human activities. Particular threats are {{the building of}} tourist facilities directly at the shore, destroying of reed belts to gain agricultural land and intense pollution close {{to the mouth of}} tributaries. Although the effects of these human impacts have not been evaluated in detail they are of great concern, as the shallow water sites are particularly rich in endemic <b>bottom</b> <b>fauna</b> and form important spawning grounds for several endemic fish species. Moreover, reed belts have great importance for water birds.|$|E
50|$|No {{inventory}} of aquatic plants has been made, but greater dodder {{has been documented}} around the Lunda Industrial Area. No rare species of <b>bottom</b> <b>fauna</b> were found during an inventory in 1999, the stream being quantitatively dominated by a few species. Noteworthy is the gastropod Valvata piscinalis found near the residential area Bällsta. The stream is, nonetheless, important for various birds, including black-headed gull, common gull, lesser black-backed gull, herring gull, and Slavonian grebe reported at Hjulsta Water Park. As stretches of the watercourse remain ice-free during winters, it attracts ducks and teal, which have both been spending winters here.|$|E

40|$|Summary: Rilska River {{is one of}} {{the left}} tributaries of Struma River and it is a {{substantial}} source of drinking water for the capital city of Sofia. In spite of that the hydrobiological data are quite poor, especially these concerning <b>bottom</b> invertebrate <b>fauna.</b> This study presents the results from research on the macrozoobenthos species composition carried out in 2007 - 2008 at six sites along the river. During the study period totally 192 benthic taxa were found. The relatively high taxa richness and the presence of species sensitive to pollution at all investigated sites are indicative of stable low-saprobic conditions in the river. It was determined that the species composition along the river continuum differed significantly in the upper and lower part of the river and a tendency of increasing species richness downstream the river was observed...|$|R
50|$|<b>Bottom</b> <b>fauna</b> {{includes}} some 53 species, typically endurable to nutrient-rich aquatic environments offering stagnant waters and {{low levels of}} oxygen - most commonly various species of Oligochaeta and Pisidium. An inventory in late 1999 / early 2000 also documented larvae of Chironomidae flies and Asellus aquaticus crustaceans; A few species of beetles and caddisflies, including species more typical for moist environments such as wetlands and marshes. Also species sensitive to acidification, such as Gammarus pulex and Baera pullata, were recorded. Near the mouth of the stream various species of mayflies common to exposed lake shores and running waters were documented.|$|E
50|$|Samples of <b>bottom</b> <b>fauna</b> {{taken in}} 1998 {{documented}} {{the presence of}} nationally rare species of gastropods such as Hippeutis complanatus and bivalve swan mussel; and during the preceding decades two species of limnetic gastropods were documented. Larvae of white-legged damselfly and blue-tailed damselfly were recorded in summer 2000. Signal crayfish and trout have been introduced in the stream, of which the former succeeded in establishing while roach {{is believed to be}} unfavourable to the latter. The white water rapids make a section of the stream ice-free during the winter time which attracts white-throated dippers and common kingfishers. In 1996, traces of beaver were reported.|$|E
50|$|Lead is {{also highly}} toxic to {{freshwater}} organisms and to humans {{if the water}} is used as drinking water. As with Silver, Lead pollution is not {{visible to the naked}} eye. The River Rheidol in west Wales had a major series of lead mines in its headwaters {{until the end of the}} 19th century and its mine discharges and waste tips remain to this day. In 1919 - 1921 only 14 species of invertebrates were found in the lower Rheidol when Lead concentrations were between 0.2ppm and 0.5ppm. By 1932 the lead concentration had reduced to 0.02ppm to 0.1ppm because of the abandonment of mining and, at those concentrations, the <b>bottom</b> <b>fauna</b> had stabilized to 103 species including three leeches.|$|E
40|$|A n {{interesting}} brachiopod fauna from Namurian (Marsdenian?) deposits — provisionally {{named the}} Meré beds herein — is described. The fauna contains seven new species: Drahanorhynchus cantabricus, Anopliopsis? parva, Caen-anoplia martinezi, Tornquistia scutiformis, Aseptella asturica, Kitakamithyris merensis, and Plicotorynifer lamellosus; and one new genus: Aseptella {{with the type}} species A. asturica. The material of a new productellid and a new ambocoeliid was too poor to give them formal names. The special character of this fauna — only a much older fauna from the Chappel Limestone of Texas (U. S. A.) being closely comparable — indicates special environmental conditions: presumably a soft, muddy <b>bottom.</b> The brachiopod <b>fauna</b> indicates a Namurian, probably Namurian B-C, age.

50|$|The fossils {{occur in}} a section of {{mudstone}} 50 m thick in the Yuanshan Member of the Qiongzhusi Formation. The Yuanshan Member is extensive, covering multiple 10000 km2 of eastern Yunnan Province, where there are many scattered outcrops yielding fossils. Studies of the strata are consistent with a tropical environment with sea level changes and tectonic activity. The region {{is believed to have}} been a shallow sea with a muddy <b>bottom.</b> The preserved <b>fauna</b> is primarily benthic and was likely buried by periodic turbidity currents, since most fossils do not show evidence of post-mortem transport. Like the younger Burgess Shale fossils, the paleo-environment enabled preservation of non-mineralized, soft body parts. Fossils are found in thin layers less than an inch thick. The soft parts are preserved as aluminosilicate films, often with high oxidized iron content and often exhibiting exquisite details.|$|R

5000|$|According to {{the results}} of research, {{performed}} by experts of Perm State University, the pollution of Mulyanka exercises strong negative influence on the condition of zoobenthos. Middle and lower parts of river are the most polluted ones. The biggest source of pollution is Lukoil Permneft Ltd, whose waste reaches Mulyanka by the Pyzh River. The oil products content of Mulyanka water at the place of the Pyzh's confluence exceeds the Maximum Permissible Concentration 49.4 times. Close to the mouth of Mulyanka ammonium content exceeds the MPC 1.3 times, 2.5 times for nitrites and 2 times for the oil products.

5000|$|While Lake Ohrid {{is special}} as such, {{by far the}} most {{spectacular}} quality is its impressive endemism. Similar to Lake Baikal or Lake Tanganyika, Lake Ohrid harbors endemic species covering the whole food-chain, from phytoplankton and sessile algae (20 species; e.g., Cyclotella fottii), over plant species (2 species; e.g., Chara ohridana), zooplankton (5 species; e.g., Cyclops ochridanus), cyprinid fish (8 species; e.g., Pachychilon pictus), to predatory fish (two trout species; the Ohrid trout complex Salmo letnica, and [...] "Belvica" [...] Salmo ohridanus) and finally its diverse endemic <b>bottom</b> <b>fauna</b> (176 species; e.g. Ochridagammarus solidus), with particularly large endemism among crustaceans, molluscs, sponges and planarians. There were recorded 68 species of freshwater snails from the Lake Ohrid basin. 73.5% (50 species) of the total freshwater gastropod fauna appear to be endemic to the Lake Ohrid basin. Whereas the endemic species list cited above is based on morphological and ecological characteristics, some recent applications of molecular genetic techniques underline the difference of the fauna from common European taxa, as well as the old age of the lake.|$|E
5000|$|Lake Ohrid (Macedonian: Охридско Езеро, Ohridsko Ezero) {{straddles}} the mountainous {{border between the}} southwestern Republic of Macedonia and eastern Albania. Lake Ohrid is the deepest lake of the Balkans, with a maximum depth of 288 m (940 ft) and a mean depth of 155 m (508 ft). It covers an area of 358 km2, containing an estimated 55.4 km³ of water. It is 30.4 km long by 14.8 km wide at its maximum extent with a shoreline length of 87.53 km, shared between the Republic of Macedonia (56.02 km) and Albania (31.51 km). The lake drains an area of around 2600 km² and is fed primarily by underground springs {{on the eastern shore}} (about 50% of total inflow), with roughly 25% shares from rivers and direct precipitation. Over 20% of the lake's water comes from nearby Lake Prespa, about 10 km to the southeast and at 150 m higher altitude than Lake Ohrid. While Lake Ohrid is special as such, by far the most spectacular quality is its impressive endemism. Similar to Lake Baikal or Lake Tanganyika, Lake Ohrid harbors endemic species covering the whole food-chain, from phytoplankton and sestile algae (20 species; e.g., Cyclotella fottii), over plant species (2 species; e.g., Chara ohridana), zooplankton (5 species; e.g., Cyclops ochridanus), cyprinid fish (8 species; e.g., Pachychilon pictus), to predatory fish (2 trout species; Ohrid trout Salmo letnica and [...] "Belvica" [...] Acantholingua ohridana) and finally its diverse endemic <b>bottom</b> <b>fauna</b> (176 species; e.g. Ochridagammarus solidus), with particularly large endemism among crustaceans, molluscs, sponges and planarians.|$|E
40|$|The Antarctic plunderfishes (Artedidraconidae) are {{a poorly}} known {{component}} of the <b>bottom</b> fish <b>fauna</b> inhabiting the continental shelf of the High Antarctic Zone. Biological data on these fishes are still rather scarce and generally based on only a few specimens. To increase the knowledge of this group, we investigated the reproductive biology and population age structure of Artedidraco skottsbergi and Dolloidraco longedorsalis, the most abundant plunderfishes collected during the 2013 / 2014 expedition of the RV Polarstern in the Weddell Sea. Based on macroscopic and histological analyses, we found that both species exhibited prolonged gametogenesis and produced few eggs. Estimates of absolute and relative fecundity were lower in A. skottsbergi than in D. longedorsalis, ranging from 69 ± 7 oocytes per female and 11. 4 ± 4. 3 oocytes/g, and from 209 ± 73 oocytes per female and 13. 5 ± 3. 7 oocytes/g, respectively. Female size at first spawning {{was estimated to be}} 9. 5 and 11 cm in A. skottsbergi and D. longedorsalis, respectively. Age and growth were assessed through otolith readings, and estimates of age ranged between 6 - 14 years in A. skottsbergi and 3 - 14 years in D. longerdorsalis. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters were only estimated for D. longedorsalis (L = 12. 5 cm, k = 0. 27, t 0 = - 0. 06). The results of this study provide insights into some of the biological aspects of these species and shed new light on their life strategies, which show similarities to those of other notothenioids...|$|R
40|$|Variability in {{tropical}} estuarine sandy <b>bottom</b> fish <b>faunas</b> was investigated along a 200 km {{section of the}} northeast coast of tropical Australia at 3 nested spatial scales: among bays, among adjacent estuaries within bays, and among replicates within estuaries. Sampling was confined to a single habitat type, shallow sandy habitats, and a single class of estuaries, those with extensive areas of shallow sand in their lower reaches. This approach was employed to minimise the biases inherent in sampling estuaries containing varying proportions of the disparate habitat types that occur {{in tropical}} estuaries. The results showed: (1) the compositions of samples from all 9 estuaries in November 1999 were quite distinct from those in July 1999, July 2000 and July 2001; (2) there were no clear differences among estuaries during November 1999, but strong differences among estuaries every July, which were greater than differences among years; and (3) there was a greater difference at the scale of estuaries than at the larger spatial scale of ‘bays’, such that the differences among estuaries within bays were consistently greater than differences among bays. This pattern was consistent between seasons and among years in the same season. The clear estuary-to-estuary variability suggests that fauna of adjacent estuaries {{are likely to be}} no more similar than the faunas of estuaries hundreds of kilometres apart. This implies that no single estuary can be assumed to be a control site that {{can be used as a}} baseline against which to judge change in a different ‘impacted’ estuary. ...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{sediment}} {{samples taken}} with a multiple corer from the Polar Front region along two profiles in the eastern South Atlantic sector between 35 ° and 57 °S have been investigated for their benthic foraminiferal content. Live fauna was differentiated from the death assemblage. Based on the dead assemblages, potential fossil assemblages (dead fauna reduced by non-resistant agglutinants) were calculated for comparison with upper Neogene core material. The distribution of the potential fossil assemblages defined by Q-mode principal component analysis mirrors the Recent hydrographic, {{as well as the}} trophic situation in the eastern South Atlantic (ocean circulation and productivity). Two Southern Component <b>Bottom</b> Water <b>Faunas</b> reflect the northward flow of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) and Lower Circum-Polar Deep Water (LCDW) : an assemblage dominated by the arenaceous Multifidella nodulosa below the Calcite Compensation Depth (CCD), and a Nuttallides umbonifer dominated assemblage above the CCD. In the region of highest bio-silicious primary productivity, south of the Polar Front and north of the winter sea-ice limit, these faunas are overprinted by a Southern High-productivity Fauna, dominated by infaunal species such as Pullenia bulloides, Melonis pompilioides and M. zaandamae. North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) meets the Circum-Polar Deep Water (CDW) at intermediate depth, as reflected in the distribution of the Northern Component Deep Water Fauna, dominated by Epistominella exigua. The high-productivity assemblage overprinting this fauna, the Northern High-productivity Fauna, is dominated by the shallow endobenthic Bulimina aculeata.

40|$|The {{study area}} is a marina named Veleiros da Ilha, a {{nautical}} facility of medium size, located in the South Bay of Santa Catarina Island. The main objective of the research was to test some physical and chemical parameters with potential use {{for the analysis of}} projects related to the location and implementation of marinas. Therefore, oxygen, copper, <b>bottom</b> sediment and <b>fauna</b> were collected and analyzed. Climatic data such as temperature and wind speed were obtained in parallel to the field work. The potential sediments revealed that there is little difference between external and internal circulation of the marina. The same occurs regarding the dissolved oxygen that indicates little influence of the marina’s structure on the internal circulation. The concentration of dissolved oxygen tends to be higher with lower temperature and higher wind intensity. The high levels of coliforms might be associated with sewage located in the surrounding area, as the marina has its own sewage treatment system. With regard to copper, the results suggest that this element’s concentration is below the limits defined by current legislation. The entrance of the marina is not in the best position, but the effects are minimized by its project, which allows good water circulation in the area...|$|R
