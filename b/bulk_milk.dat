25|$|When {{refrigeration}} {{first arrived}} (the 19th century) the equipment was initially used to cool cans of milk, which were filled by hand milking. These cans were placed into a cooled water bath {{to remove heat}} and keep them cool until {{they were able to}} be transported to a collection facility. As more automated methods were developed for harvesting milk, hand milking was replaced and, as a result, the milk can was replaced by a <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> cooler. 'Ice banks' were the first type of <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> cooler. This was a double wall vessel with evaporator coils and water located between the walls at the bottom and sides of the tank. A small refrigeration compressor was used to remove heat from the evaporator coils. Ice eventually builds up around the coils, until it reaches a thickness of about three inches surrounding each pipe, and the cooling system shuts off. When the milking operation starts, only the milk agitator and the water circulation pump, which flows water across the ice and the steel walls of the tank, are needed to reduce the incoming milk to a temperature below 5 degrees.|$|E
25|$|This {{cooling method}} {{worked well for}} smaller dairies, however was fairly inefficient {{and was unable to}} meet the {{increasingly}} higher cooling demand of larger milking parlors. In the mid-1950s direct expansion refrigeration was first applied directly to the <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> cooler. This type of cooling utilizes an evaporator built directly into the inner wall of the storage tank to remove heat from the milk. Direct expansion is able to cool milk at a much faster rate than early ice bank type coolers and is still the primary method for bulk tank cooling today on small to medium-sized operations.|$|E

25|$|Another device {{which has}} contributed {{significantly}} to milk quality is the plate heat exchanger (PHE). This device utilizes a number of specially designed stainless steel plates with small spaces between them. Milk is passed between every other set of plates with water being passed between {{the balance of the}} plates to remove heat from the milk. This method of cooling can remove large amounts of heat from the milk in a very short time, thus drastically slowing bacteria growth and thereby improving milk quality. Ground water is the most common source of cooling medium for this device. Dairy cows consume approximately 3 gallons of water for every gallon of milk production and prefer to drink slightly warm water as opposed to cold ground water. For this reason, PHE's can result in drastically improved milk quality, reduced operating costs for the dairymen by reducing the refrigeration load on his <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> cooler, and increased milk production by supplying the cows with a source of fresh warm water.|$|E
2500|$|Plate heat {{exchangers}} have also evolved {{as a result}} of the increase of dairy farm herd sizes in the United States. As a dairyman increases the size of his herd, he must also increase the capacity of his milking parlor in order to harvest the additional milk.

Today's larger farms produce milk at a rate which direct expansion refrigeration systems on <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> coolers cannot cool in a timely manner. PHE's are typically utilized in this instance to rapidly cool the milk to the desired temperature (or close to it) before it reaches the <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> tank. Typically, ground water is still utilized to provide some initial cooling to bring the milk to between [...] A second (and sometimes third) section of the PHE is added to remove the remaining heat with a mixture of chilled pure water and propylene glycol.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{present study}} aimed to {{identify}} the climate condition parameters {{that are associated with}} the occurrence of antimicrobial and macrocyclic lactone residues in <b>bulk</b> tank <b>milk</b> using a multivariate principal components analysis (PCA). A total of 132 raw milk samples were collected at dairy farms in Minas Gerais State in Brazil and analyzed for 35 analytes, comprising macrocyclic lactones and antibacterials, using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry in tandem mode spectrometry. Of the 132 samples, 34 (25. 76 %) <b>bulk</b> tank <b>milk</b> samples were positive for at least one analyte. PCA showed that antimicrobial residues in <b>bulk</b> tank <b>milk</b> occurred less frequently on days with a higher average temperature, maximum temperature and temperature-humidity index. In contrast, relative humidity was inversely associated with antimicrobial residues in raw milk. The PCA showed that daily milk production was also related to macrocyclic lactone residues, while rainfall showed an inverse association. Thus, some climate conditions, such as average temperature, maximum temperature and temperature-humidity index, can predict the moments with lower risk of occurrence of antimicrobial residues in <b>bulk</b> tank <b>milk,</b> in contrast to relative humidity. Furthermore, the risk of macrocyclic lactone residues in <b>bulk</b> tank <b>milk</b> was higher in months with less rainfall...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is a {{recently}} emerged virus of ruminants in Europe. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) {{are commonly used}} to detect SBV-specific antibodies in <b>bulk</b> tank <b>milk</b> samples to monitor herd exposure to infection. However, it has previously been shown that a <b>bulk</b> tank <b>milk</b> sample can test positive even though the majority of cows within the herd are seronegative for SBV antibodies.

Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the agreement between antibody levels measured in milk and serum. RESULTS: Corresponding milk and serum samples from 88 cows in two dairy herds in the UK were tested for presence of immunoglobulin G antibodies to SBV using a commercially-available indirect ELISA.

40|$|Q fever is a {{zoonotic}} disease, {{caused by}} the obligate intracellular bacterium Coxiella burnetii. Between 2007 and 2010, Q fever {{has been a major}} public health concern in the Netherlands, with almost 3500 human cases reported and dairy goats considered to be the most probable source. At the end of 2009, the Dutch government decided to cull all pregnant dairy sheep and dairy goats based on <b>bulk</b> tank <b>milk</b> C. burnetii positive farms, aiming to preventing shedding and to reducing environmental contamination. On <b>bulk</b> tank <b>milk</b> C. burnetii PCR positive farms, a life-time breeding ban was implemented for all remaining non-pregnant small ruminants. This study describes test results on a <b>bulk</b> tank <b>milk</b> C. burnetii PCR positive dairy goat farm on which all goats had been vaccinated against Q fever with an inactivated phase one vaccine since 2008. All pregnant dairy goats of this farm were culled in 2010, after which <b>bulk</b> tank <b>milk</b> was negative in the C. burnetii PCR. One year later, however, this farm became <b>bulk</b> tank <b>milk</b> C. burnetii PCR positive again. From all lactating animals on the farm (n = 350), individual milk samples were collected and tested using a commercial real-time PCR assay. Individual milk samples from five dairy goats appeared to be C. burnetii PCR positive. These positive goats had been born on the farm between 2002 and 2006. At postmortem examination, out of 33 mostly tissue samples per animal, only milk and mammary tissue samples were C. burnetii PCR positive.

For the assessment of risk factors, a case-control study was conducted from January 2006 to May 2007.
