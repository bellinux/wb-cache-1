40|$|The predatory mite, Galendromus flumenis (Chant) (Acari: Phytoseiidae), is {{the most}} {{abundant}} predator and the only phytoseiid species on date bunches infested with <b>Banks</b> <b>grass</b> <b>mite,</b> Oligonychus pratensis (Banks) (Acari: Tetranychidae). Biological studies were conducted on this predatory mite {{in order to develop}} and optimize biological control strategies against the <b>Banks</b> <b>grass</b> <b>mite.</b> In the first chapter, studies showed that G. flumenis feeds on all immature stages of <b>Banks</b> <b>grass</b> <b>mite,</b> but it prefers eggs over the other stages. Functional response studies indicated that the predator displays a type II response on all immature stages of the prey. The mutual interference study in Chapter 2 revealed that total predation increased with increasing G. flumenis density in two arena sizes. However, there was not a proportional increase in per capita predation due to mutual interference. The interference effect was high in small arenas due to higher encounter rates between predators. Also, higher predator density and smaller arena size caused significantly higher dispersal rate of predators. In Chapter 3 data show that G. flumenis develops under a wide range of temperatures from 18 °C to 42 °C, but survival rates were highest between 26 °C and 38 °C. The optimal temperature for development (Topt) was calculated to be 37. 6 °C. Further work on the population growth and reproduction of G. flumenis (Chapter 4) showed that predators cannot oviposit at 38 °C (Topt). At 34 °C, the next temperature with the shortest developmental time for the predator, G. flumenis showed medium reproductive capacity (1. 6 eggs/ day and 19. 9 eggs/ ovipositional period), which is inferior to its prey. The net reproductive rate of prey can reach three times the maximum potential of G. flumenis, contributing to an intrinsic rate of natural increase of the prey that is more than double that of the predator. In the final chapter, treatment with the miticide hexythiazox had little or no effect on immature development and reproduction of emerging adult predators. Hexythiazox did not have any adverse effect on the fecundity of treated females, hatch rate of eggs, progeny development, or sex ratio...|$|E
40|$|This NebGuide {{describes}} the two common spider mites found in Nebraska corn and soybeans, their natural enemies and management. Two species of spider mites, the <b>Banks</b> <b>grass</b> <b>mite</b> and twospotted spider mite, commonly feed on Nebraska corn. Banks grass mites (BGM) feed {{almost exclusively on}} grasses, including corn and sorghum. Twospotted spider mites (TSM) not only feed on many species of grasses, but also on soybeans, fruit trees {{and a variety of}} vegetables and ornamental plants. Although these two species are somewhat similar in appearance, they differ in several biological characteristics and in their susceptibility to pesticides. Banks grass mites usually appear earlier in the season, feed mostly on the lower leaves of the corn plant, and in Nebraska are moderately susceptible to many of the commonly used miticides. On the other hand, TSM tend to appear in mid to late season, increase rapidly, feed over the entire plant, and often are not consistently controlled by available pesticides...|$|E

40|$|Drought {{conditions}} are {{prevalent in the}} Intermountain West and are predicted to persist, while neonicotinoids {{are one of the}} most widely used insecticides as seed treatment in corn. Spider mites, a very common pest, are thought to proliferate with elevated temperature and prolonged dry conditions and with applications of neonicotinoids. On one hand drought is thought to increase the plant nutrient availability and make it more susceptible to herbivory; on the other hand neonicotinoids appear to modify plant physiological pathways leading to enhanced spider mite reproductive rate. What it is not clear is how these two factors interact and what the outcomes are for spider mites. In the summer of 2013 and 2014 we conducted a field study to examine the effect of drought stress (+,-) and neonicotinoid corn seed treatments (+,-) on the resident population of <b>Banks</b> <b>grass</b> <b>mites</b> on field corn plants receiving 100 %, 50 % (moderate water stress) and 25 % (heavy water stress) of the total water lost by evapotranspiration. Mites were recorded weekly throughout the season. Our results show that drought stress increases the abundance of mites and, interestingly, the effect of drought is exacerbated by the use of neonicotinoid insecticides only when combined with heavy water stress. Growers can expect higher mite outbreaks under dry conditions, therefore irrigation and insecticide use should be managed more cautiously...|$|R

40|$|Within plant {{dispersal}} of <b>Banks</b> <b>grass</b> <b>mite</b> (BGM), Oligonychus pratensis (Banks), and twospotted spider mite (TSM), Tetranychus urticae Koch, was evaluated through field experiments. Mites were introduced onto host plants at three {{levels in the}} canopy: flag leaf, ear leaf and third lowest leaf. Mites introduced onto the flag leaf survived poorly {{and moved to the}} lower parts of the plants. Both BGM and TSM did the best on the middle and lower leaves. TSM was more likely to disperse both upwards and downwards from the infested leaf than BGM. ^ Dispersal behavior of the predatory mite (NEO), Neoseiulus fallacis (Garman), was evaluated by simulating walking patterns for various prey and temperature combinations. The results were that NEO exhibited a random walk type of search more frequently at moderate to high prey densities (search for prey within a prey patch) and a very non-random, directional search more frequently at low prey densities (search for new prey patches). The non-random search allows the mite to closely follow leaf edges and quickly travel substantial distances in search of new prey patches. ^ A simulation model of the mite predator/prey system consisting of BGM and NEO was developed and validated. This model included the effects of temperature, humidity and predation and was coupled to a detailed plant canopy model. Results demonstrated the importance of using leaf surface conditions instead of weather station conditions to simulate the mite system on corn in Nebraska. Also, humidity was determined to be critically important (in addition to temperature) in NEO/BGM population dynamics. The temperature and humidity at the leaf surface of moderately drought stressed corn (compared to well watered corn) resulted in higher populations of BGM. Simulation studies also showed that colonization of a corn field by less than 1 adult female BGM/plant in June can result in crop destruction by August. ...|$|E

Developmental rates were shown to be highly temperature dependent and maximum development was predicted to be near 37 C. ^ A wet-dry, forced air humidity system was designed to provide high, medium, and low vapor pressure deficits (VPD) at 25, 33, 36, and 39 C. Humidity was shown to have little effect on development. However, at 39 C and low VPD, egg hatch was severely reduced. ^ Temperature had a greater influence on longevity than did humidity. BGM lived longer at cooler temperatures. At high temperatures, longevity tended to be reduced at lower VPD. ^ The intrinsic {{rate of natural increase}} (r(,m)) was dependent on temperature and humidity. At 25 C, r(,m) was similar for the 3 VPDs. However, at 33, 36, and 39 C, low VPD conditions caused a reduction in survival rates and fecundity, resulting in lower r(,m). The highest r(,m) occurred at 36 C and high VPD. ^ Field studies indicated that BGM numbers increased most rapidly over a narrow range of plant stress. Severe stress resulted in low numbers, probably due to reduced nutritional quality of the host. Non-stressed plants also had low BGM numbers. On moderately stressed plants, mite populations tended to be directly related to the amount of stress. Corn canopy and leaf temperatures were higher on stressed plants and canopy temperatures were significantly correlated with BGM numbers. ^ These data suggest that high canopy temperatures and low humidities may promote fast developmental rates, high survival rates and increased fecundity of BGM, resulting in a high r(,m). Therefore, BGM densities appear to be closely linked to microenvironmental conditions. ...|$|E

Each trial included two amounts of irrigation and winter wheat and three amounts of herbicide to control weeds. Upon completion of the agronomy trials, the plots were split into two subplots and one was tilled. Pitfall traps were installed to capture ground dwelling arthropods: (Coleoptera: Carabidae), wolf spiders (Araneae: Lycosidae) and crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). Four carabid genera were more common under no-till conditions. One was more common in tilled plots. Five carabid genera were more common in plots with a history of high weed densities.

Insecticide applications were timed for control of first and second generation European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), larvae. Densities of twospotted spider mites, Tetranychus urticae (Koch), significantly increased only in those plots receiving an application of permethrin for control of second generation European corn borer larvae. <b>Banks</b> <b>grass</b> <b>mite,</b> Oligonychus pratensis (Banks), densities did not significantly increase compared to control plots following any of the insecticide treatments. Mite predator numbers were generally low throughout the study and no significant changes in densities were observed between pre-treatment and post-treatment sampling. Field temperatures were sub-optimal for spider mite reproduction throughout the study period. These suboptimal temperatures might have altered {{some or all of}} the causative factors of spider mite increases. ^ Laboratory studies were conducted to determine if dispersal and reproductive behavior of spider mites are affected when exposed to direct and residual sub-lethal concentrations of methyl parathion and permethrin. Results indicated increased dispersal of both species of spider mites at all concentrations. Mites showed greater dispersal when exposed to insecticides directly compared with residual exposure. There were significant differences in mite ovipositional rates between lower and higher insecticide doses. Reduced oviposition was observed at higher concentrations of both insecticides. ^ Our studies show that neither destruction of mite predators nor pesticide-induced reproductive stimulation are important factors causing mite increases. However, insecticide-induced dispersal of spider mites might play a role in the spider mite outbreaks. Future research should focus on the effect of the insecticides on the fungal pathogens (Neozygites sp.) which can be an important mortality factor for spider mites under field conditions. ...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundLittle {{is known}} about {{longitudinal}} patterns {{of the development of}} IgE to distinct allergen components. ObjectiveWe sought to investigate the evolution of IgE responses to allergenic components of timothy <b>grass</b> and dust <b>mite</b> during childhood. MethodsIn a population-based birth cohort (n = 1184) we measured IgE responses to 15 components from timothy <b>grass</b> and dust <b>mite</b> in children with available samples at 3 time points (ages 5, 8, and 11 years; n = 235). We designed a nested, 2 -stage latent class analysis to identify cross-sectional sensitization patterns at each follow-up and their longitudinal trajectories. We then ascertained the association of longitudinal trajectories with asthma, rhinitis, eczema, and lung function in children with component data for at least 2 time points (n = 534). ResultsLongitudinal latent class analysis revealed 3 grass sensitization trajectories: (1) no/low sensitization; (2) early onset; and (3) late onset. The early-onset trajectory was associated with asthma and diminished lung function, and the late-onset trajectory was associated with rhinitis. Four longitudinal trajectories emerged for mite: (1) no/low sensitization; (2) group 1 allergens; (3) group 2 allergens; and (3) complete mite sensitization. Children in the complete mite sensitization trajectory had the highest odds ratios (ORs) for asthma (OR, 7. 15; 95 % CI, 3. 80 - 13. 44) and were the only group significantly associated with comorbid asthma, rhinitis, and eczema (OR, 5. 91; 95 % CI, 2. 01 - 17. 37). Among children with wheezing, those in the complete mite sensitization trajectory (but not other longitudinal mite trajectories) had significantly higher risk of severe exacerbations (OR, 3. 39; 95 % CI, 1. 62 - 6. 67).
