5|$|During {{and after}} World War II, the Yehudi lights project {{developed}} counter-illumination camouflage using lamps {{to increase the}} <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft to match the <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky. This was abandoned with improvements in radar, which seemed to render visible light camouflage redundant. However, aircraft continue to be painted in camouflage schemes; recent experiments have again explored active camouflage systems which allow colors, patterns and brightness to be changed to match the background, and some air forces have painted their fighters in digital camouflage patterns. Stealth technology, as in the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, aims to minimize an aircraft's radar cross-section and infrared signature, effectively providing multi-spectral camouflage {{at the price of}} reduced flying performance. Stealth may extend to avoiding or preventing vapor contrails.|$|E

5|$|After its {{perihelion}} passage, {{the comet}} moved into dark skies, {{and although it}} faded as it receded from the Sun it remained {{one of the most}} prominent objects in the sky. On 30 September, observers, including Finlay and E. E.

5|$|Although {{observations}} using {{adaptive optics}} in late 1997 and early 1998 showed a double {{peak in the}} <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nucleus, controversy still exists over whether such observations can only be explained by a binary nucleus.

40|$|International audienceThe {{interaction}} <b>of</b> Io with <b>the</b> Jovian magnetosphere {{creates the}} best known and brightest satellite-controlled aurorae in our solar system. These aurorae are generated by <b>the</b> precipitation <b>of</b> electrons, which are accelerated by the Alfvén waves carrying the current between the satellite and the planet. A recent study computed the energy deposited on top of Jupiter's ionosphere due to the electron precipitation and retrieved <b>the</b> correct mean <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> Io-related aurorae. <b>The</b> model developed in this study {{takes into account the}} acceleration mechanism and the Alfvén wave propagation effects. We use the same method to investigate <b>the</b> <b>brightness</b> variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Io footprint as a function of longitude. These observations are discussed in a companion paper. We identify several effects that act together to modulate the footprint brightness such as Alfvén wave reflections, magnetic mirroring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electrons, the local interaction at Io and kinetic effects close to Jupiter. We identify the effects contributing the most to <b>the</b> modulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightnesses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three brightest components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Io footprints: the main and reflected Alfvén wing spots and the transhemispheric electron spot.

5|$|In {{many animals}} {{of the deep}} sea, {{including}} several squid species, bacterial bioluminescence is used for camouflage by counterillumination, in which the animal matches the overhead environmental light as seen from below. In these animals, photoreceptors control the illumination to match the <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> background. These light organs are usually separate from the tissue containing the bioluminescent bacteria. However, in one species, Euprymna scolopes, the bacteria are an integral component of the animal's light organ.|$|E
5|$|In the {{diffused}} lighting camouflage project, the Royal Canadian Navy experimented with variable counter-illumination camouflage to match horizon light levels and minimize ships' silhouettes during prolonged arctic twilight.

5|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} from the Sun breaks water molecules apart, {{reducing the amount of}} water available to form noctilucent clouds.

5|$|At present, {{the orbits}} of the Haumean moons appear almost exactly edge-on from Earth, with Namaka having {{periodically}} occulted Haumea from 2009 to 2011. Observation of such transits would provide precise information on {{the size and shape}} of Haumea and its moons, as happened in the late 1980s with Pluto and Charon. The tiny change in <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system during these occultations required at least a medium-aperture professional telescope for detection. Hiʻiaka last occulted Haumea in 1999, a few years before its discovery, and will not do so again for some 130 years. However, in a situation unique among regular satellites, the great torquing of Namaka's orbit by Hiʻiaka preserved the viewing angle of Namaka–Haumea transits for several more years.|$|E
5|$|Counter-illumination through {{bioluminescence}} on {{the underside}} (ventral region) {{of the body is}} found in many species that live in the open ocean down to about 1000 metres. The generated light increases an animal's brightness when seen from below to match the <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ocean surface; it is an effective form of active camouflage. It is notably used by some species of squid, such as the midwater squid, Abralia veranyi. These have light-producing organs (photophores) scattered all over their undersides, creating a sparkling glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below. Counter-illumination camouflage is the likely function of the bioluminescence of many marine organisms, though light is also produced to attract or to detect prey and for signalling.|$|E

5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} can be {{dangerous}} if proper precautions are not taken. Since GMAW employs an electric arc, welders wear protective clothing, including heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets, to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. In addition, the <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electric arc {{is a source of}} the condition known as arc eye, an inflammation of the cornea caused by ultraviolet light and, in prolonged exposure, possible burning of the retina in the eye. Conventional welding helmets contain dark face plates to prevent this exposure. Newer helmet designs feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darken upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. Transparent welding curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightness}} of a star, {{as seen from}} Earth, is measured with a standardized, logarithmic scale. This apparent magnitude is a numerical value that decreases in value with increasing <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star. The faintest stars visible to the unaided eye are sixth magnitude, while the brightest, Sirius, is of magnitude −1.46. To standardize the magnitude scale, astronomers chose Vega to represent magnitude zero at all wavelengths. Thus, for many years, Vega {{was used as a}} baseline for the calibration of absolute photometric brightness scales. However, this is no longer the case, as the apparent magnitude zero point is now commonly defined in terms of a particular numerically specified flux. This approach is more convenient for astronomers, since Vega is not always available for calibration.|$|E
