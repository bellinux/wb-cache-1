The group had been on track to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> 1896 record of 54days by 10days.|$|E

If the principes could not <b>break</b> <b>the</b> enemy they would retire behind the triarii, who would then engage the enemy.|$|E

In this paper, we show that (1) <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> scheme is equivalent to <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> Diffie-Hellman key exchange scheme over Zn, and (2) impersonation is easier than <b>breaking.</b> <b>The</b> second result is obtained by proving that <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> RSA publickey cryptosystem reduces to <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> Diffie-Hellman scheme over Zn {{with respect to the}} polynomial-time many-one reducibility. ...|$|R

And it was decided to charge at the junction between the Muslim right center and its right wing held by Qanatir's Slavs, to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> two apart and to fight them separately.|$|E
5|$|The tail club of Ankylosaurus {{seems to}} have been an active {{defensive}} weapon, capable of producing enough of an impact to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> bones of an assailant. The tendons of the tail were partially ossified and were not very elastic, allowing great force to be transmitted to the club when it was used as a weapon. Coombs suggested in 1979 that several hindlimb muscles would have controlled the swinging of the tail, and that violent thrusts of the club {{would have been able to}} <b>break</b> <b>the</b> metatarsal bones of large theropods.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{project-based}} {{thesis that}} studies <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> fourth wall from an existentialist approach through the short film Nina Nak Kahwin?. Although {{there have been}} adequate of studies on <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> fourth wall from a spectatorship standpoint, {{there is a lack}} of appreciation in how <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> fourth wall in a film can exude aesthetic and philosophical values. Therefore in this dissertation, I conduct a qualitative study on in-depth analysis based on existential concepts illuminated by renowned philosophers Søren Kierkegaard and Jean Paul Sartre of the human condition of being and anxiety and incorporating in the analysis of Tom Brown’s examples of <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> fourth wall agency, intimacy and honesty performed by the main character Nina. Therefore, in this study, I extract existential qualities through the direction and narration style of <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> fourth wall in this film...|$|R

5|$|At 09:24 on {{the morning}} of 1 June, Howe sent his ships into action using the {{original}} tactic of turning each ship in his line northwest simultaneously, so that they would bear down individually on Villaret's fleet and each <b>break</b> <b>the</b> enemy line separately. His intention was to cut the French line in 25 places, raking the enemy vessels at both bow and stern and dividing their fire so they could be defeated piecemeal. Ultimately though this ambitious plan failed, due to ill-discipline among Howe's subordinates and the damage his fleet had sustained over the previous week. While six of Howe's ships did <b>break</b> <b>the</b> French line as ordered, and several others came close, many of his captains failed to follow orders and instead engaged the enemy from a distance in desultory gun duels which had little effect.|$|E
5|$|Chambers transitioned {{into the}} senior ranks soon after, taking the 100m silver medal behind his British {{teammate}} Darren Campbell at the 1998 European Championships. He achieved a new personal best in September at the 1998 IAAF World Cup with {{a run of}} 10.03s for third place and won a relay gold medal. At the 1998 Commonwealth Games he was a 100m semi finalist and set a games record {{as part of the}} 4×100m relay team. His ability attracted the attention of former sprinter and Commonwealth Games gold medallist Mike McFarlane, who became his coach. He came first in the 100m in the 1999 European Cup, then at a meet in Nuremberg he became only the second European sprinter (after Linford Christie) to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> ten second barrier with a time of 9.99s. Fellow British sprinter Jason Gardener scored a time of 9.98s in Lausanne soon after, becoming the third Briton to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> barrier. In spite of this, Chambers remained some distance behind his North American counterparts.|$|E

40|$|This study {{estimates}} <b>the</b> <b>break</b> {{point in}} <b>the</b> residual variance {{and in the}} propagation mechanism of the real exchange rates at {{about the time of}} the Asian crisis that occurred in 1997, and provides some explanations for <b>the</b> <b>breaks.</b> <b>The</b> <b>breaks</b> in <b>the</b> residual variance increased the volatility of the real exchange rates, which given the overall effects of common adverse shocks to the countries seems to be reinforced by the sudden withdrawal of Japanese commercial banks' lending to the region. And <b>the</b> subsequent <b>breaks</b> in <b>the</b> propagation mechanism reduced the volatility, which reflects the change in the government policy stance to result in smoothing the pace of appreciation. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> in <b>the</b> nominal exchange rates rather than in the price ratios are mainly responsible for <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> in <b>the</b> real exchange rates...|$|R
