40|$|Grounded on a {{political}} ecology approach, this study sheds light on <b>oil</b> <b>bunkering</b> activity that is done by local militants in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Such <b>oil</b> <b>bunkering</b> {{is used as a}} euphemism for oil theft in Nigeria. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the perception of <b>oil</b> <b>bunkering</b> that is done by groups (militants) of the local communities of the Niger Delta. By collecting and comparing the narratives of the three actors linked to so-called illegal <b>oil</b> <b>bunkering.</b> The three actors are the locals of the Niger Delta, the Nigerian government and the multinational oil companies (MNOCs). Such <b>Oil</b> <b>bunkering</b> that is done by the local militants of the Niger Delta has dominated the local politics since the 1990 s. Through narrative analysis I have identified three different stories from the three different actors. The government and the Multinational oil companies (MNOCs) operating in the Niger Delta perceives, such <b>oil</b> <b>bunkering</b> is seen as illegal activity that affects the nation’s economy, as well as causing environmental degradation in the Niger Delta. However, oil have contributed enormously to the national economy since the inception of oil exploration in the Niger Delta. To many people, such as the government agencies and its allies, these growth have brought income opportunities and growth to the local communities of the Niger Delta. In contrast to the inhabitants of the Niger Delta such economic growth is yet to translate to economic development, and an appreciable increase in the standard of living. Despite being the goose that lays the golden egg. This is coupled with certain fundamental issues such as continuous neglect by state, political marginalization and the failure of state interventionist efforts at ameliorating the suffering of the inhabitants of the region. The consequence of this is reinforcing the option of resistance and violence, as against peaceful engagement with the state. This is manifested in the increasing violence and lawlessness epitomized by the incidence of kidnapping of oil workers, seizure of MNOCs oil facilities, destruction of oil installations, as well as <b>oil</b> <b>bunkering</b> which is the focus of this study. By using narrative analysis, I found that the local communities sees <b>oil</b> <b>bunkering</b> {{as an integral part of}} their protest against the state and the multinational companies operating in the Niger Delta. This is an approach within political ecology, and narrative analysis offers a way of obtaining a rich understanding of the main ways that locals of the Niger Delta experience and perceives <b>oil</b> <b>bunkering.</b> As well as the state and MNOCs approach towards the locals, by means of their presentations of relevant narratives. By doing this I also aim at contributing trend of political ecology to the Niger Delta region. The local communities of the Niger Delta have been 11 embroiled in resistance against the federal government and the multinational oil companies (MNOCs). Multilayered issues such as lack of control, participation, revenue allocation, resources control and more, institute the main grievances against the oil companies and the government. Cognizant of these issues, the state and MNOCs have not applied a more holistic approach, for this reason the local communities in the Niger Delta lost confidence in both the state and MNOCs. Hence these led to the issues the Niger Delta is facing today. Such <b>Oil</b> <b>bunkering</b> activities done by the local militants of the Niger Delta is a classic example of the perceived struggle and resistance of the Niger Delta militants over control of the natural resources in their region. The local’s militants are indigenes of the Niger Delta, they represent the resistance group and they are the main figure in <b>oil</b> <b>bunkering.</b> This study carried a more in-depth analysis of the local communities’ narratives on <b>oil</b> <b>bunkering</b> than other stakeholder’s narratives. However, this study also presented extensive position of other actors narratives linked to <b>oil</b> <b>bunkering</b> in the Niger Delta. My reason for doing this is that, as a researcher for this study I find the local communities of the Niger Delta to constitute the most challenging task to understand. The locals are more challenging to understand, because my main interest is to understand the local’s community’s perceptions. Therefore deeper focus on these, whilst to understand the context of other narratives are pertinent to identify the narrative landscape to compare and contrast. This study further argues that <b>oil</b> <b>bunkering</b> activities in the Niger Delta emerged due to grievances by the people of the Niger Delta, which is attributed to the failure of the state and the multinational oil companies (MNOCs) to comply with the demands of the local community of the Niger Delta. This thesis further shows that, the current <b>oil</b> <b>bunkering</b> activities in Niger Delta have become a mixture of genuine grievance and greed as well as opportunism. M-D...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{a larger}} study on the {{bioremediation}} of oil spills in tropical mangrove habitats, we conducted a series of flask experiments to test for the presence of hydrocarbon degrading microdashorganisms in representative wetland habitats. Also tested was the biodegradation of selected oils (Gippsland Crude, Arabian Light Crude and Bunker C), that are transported along the Australian coast. We also tested for potential inhibition of biodegradation by natural organics in the mangrove pore waters and evaluated the ability of an oxygen release compound (ORC) to stimulate biodegradative processes. Evaporation was a significant factor in removing the light alkane and aromatic hydrocarbons from air and nitrogen sparged flasks. Evaporation removed sim 27 % of the Gippsland, sim 37 %of the Arabian, and sim 10 % of the <b>Bunker</b> <b>oils.</b> Oxygen was necessary to support biodegradation as expected. The microdashorganisms were capable of biodegrading the nondashvolatile saturate fraction of each oil. Degradation removed another 14 of the Gippsland, 30 of the Arabian, and 22 of the <b>Bunker</b> C <b>oils.</b> Normalisation of the individual aromatic hydrocarbon classes to internal triterpane biomarkers indicated some degradation of aromatics in the Arabian Light and <b>Bunker</b> C <b>oils.</b> Although alkane degradation rates were comparable in the three oils, the Gippsland oil had a higher wax content and after 14 days incubation, still contained as much as 25 of the alkanes present in the original oil. Thus, degradation of its aromatic fraction may have been delayed. Based on these results we estimate that Arabian Light Crude oil would have a shorter residence time than the other oils in mangrove sediment. It has a higher content of light hydrocarbons, which are readily removed by both physical and microbial processes. The Bunker C would be expected to have the longest residence time in mangrove sediment, because it contains a larger percentage of higher molecular weight, unresolved components. Comparison of the efficiency of inoculates from three tropical intertidal habitats (Avicennia and Rhizophora mangroves, plus salt marsh sediments) indicated the presence of hydrocarbon degrading microdashorganisms in all three habitats. There was no known history of oil contamination in the soil source area. There was no inhibition of degradation due to addition of mangrove pore waters. The ORC did not facilitate degradation in closed laboratory experiments. These results were used to formulate a bioremediation strategy to treat oiled sediments in mangrove forests in Queensland Australia, which was based on forced aeration and nutrient addition.
