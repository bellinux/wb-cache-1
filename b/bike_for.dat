25|$|Sometimes {{known as}} bike library systems, these {{bicycles}} may be lent free of charge, for a refundable deposit, {{or for a}} small fee. A bicycle is checked out to one person who will typically keep the <b>bike</b> <b>for</b> several months, and is encouraged or obliged to lock it between uses. A disadvantage of this system is a lower usage frequency, around three uses per day on average as compared to 10 to 15 uses per day typically experienced with other bike-sharing schemes.|$|E

The Royal Enfield Bullet {{was chosen as the}} most suitable <b>bike</b> <b>for</b> the job. The Indian government ordered 800 350cc model Bullets. In 1955, the Redditch company partnered with Madras Motors in India to form 'Enfield India' to assemble, under licence, the 350cc Royal Enfield Bullet motorcycle in Madras (now called Chennai). The tooling was sold to Enfield India so that they could manufacture components. By 1962, all components were made in India. The Indian Enfield uses the 1960 engine (with metric bearing sizes), Royal Enfield still makes an essentially similar bike in the 350cc and 500cc models, along with several different models for different market segments.|$|E

At this event Hoy won both the Sprint and Keirin competitions, defeating likes of Jason Kenny, Jamie Staff, Ross Edgar, Matthew Crampton and Teun Mulder along the way. Hoy competed in the World Cup Classics series' final event in Copenhagen, Denmark in February, helping his team to a gold medal in the team sprint event. However, he crashed out during the men's Keirin final and was forced to miss the final day of competition, including the men's sprint. Although at first, his injury seemed minor, he returned to Manchester where, following a scan, he was diagnosed with a serious de-gloving injury which finished his season and kept him off his <b>bike</b> <b>for</b> almost 3 months. He was unable to compete as planned at the Revolution 24 event in Manchester the following weekend, he did however make an appearance at the event. He has had to pull out of the World Championships in Poland at the end of March, where he would have attempted to defend 2 World titles, because of the hip injury.|$|E

As a {{child growing up}} in the rural {{agriculture}} area just off highway 132 near the West side vineyards of E & J Gallo Winery of Modesto, Roberts was originally interested in horseback riding. He rode his first motorcycle at the age of 12 when a friend dared him to ride a mini bike. Roberts accepted the challenge and the experience thrilled him. He built his own motorcycle by attaching his father's lawn mower engine to a bicycle frame. Roberts began his career in dirt track racing after attending a local race in Modesto and deciding that he wanted to compete himself. His father purchased a Tohatsu <b>bike</b> <b>for</b> him, but once it proved itself uncompetitive as a race bike, he moved up to a more powerful Hodaka motorcycle.|$|E

2500|$|Suzuki joined Sega in 1983 as a programmer. In {{his first}} year, {{he created a}} 2D boxing game called Champion Boxing for Sega's first home game console, the SG-1000. According to Suzuki, the {{executive}} staff at Sega found the game so impressive that they released it in arcades as-is by simply installing an SG-1000 into an arcade cabinet. He was promoted to project leader while still {{in his first year}} at the company. Then, Suzuki began working on another arcade game which would prove to be the big stepping-off point of his career. [...] "To develop this game," [...] Suzuki told G4TV, [...] "I rode on motorcycles a lot. [...] When we came up with the prototype (for the arcades), I would ride on that prototype <b>bike</b> <b>for</b> hours and hours every day." [...] His efforts culminated into the game Hang-On, released in 1985. Hang-On was a success as it broke new ground in arcade technology. It did not feature any traditional controls, as the movement of the on-screen avatar was dictated by the movements the player made with their body on the motorcycle cabinet. This began the [...] "Taikan" [...] trend, the use of motion-controlled hydraulic arcade cabinets in many arcade games of the late 1980s, two decades before motion controls became popular on video game consoles. Running on the Sega Space Harrier hardware, it was also the first of Sega's [...] "Super Scaler" [...] arcade system boards that allowed three-dimensional sprite/texture-scaling at high frame rates. The three-dimensional sprite/tile scaling was handled in a similar manner to textures in later texture-mapped polygonal 3D games of the 1990s. Suzuki stated that his [...] "designs were always 3D from the beginning. All the calculations in the system were 3D, even from Hang-On. I calculated the position, scale, and zoom rate in 3D and converted it backwards to 2D. So I was always thinking in 3D." ...|$|E
