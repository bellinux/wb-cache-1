40|$|The unique wetting {{properties}} of superhydrophobic (SH) surfaces have attracted a considerable interest in recent years. Their ability to repel liquids produces some remarkable {{characteristics such as}} spherical droplet formations with enhanced mobility, self cleaning properties, anti-sticking abilities and reduced drag on liquid flows. These wetting phenomena are directly attributed to the Cassie-Baxter wetting condition, where a SH surface supports a fluid on top of its microstructured features and traps a gas layer within the vacant regions. While the interactions of liquid droplets on SH surfaces have been well explored, in contrast, {{little attention has been}} given to the characteristics of SH surfaces when completely immersed in a fluid. In micro-scaled environments, SH surfaces can have a considerable influence on the fluidic interactions. This thesis aims to explore some of the flow and interfacial phenomena which are created by SH surfaces located in fluid filled microchannels. The drag reducing {{properties of}} SH surfaces with arrays of circular micropillar structures were investigated by measuring the pressure drop reduction across a parallel plate channel with one SH wall surface. The results from six individual SH surfaces with di erent solid surface fractions showed very little drag reduction for laminar flows (Re< 70). It was proposed that both the curvature of the liquid-gas interfaces and the development of intermediate wetting states were responsible for the reduced slip lengths. A further study confirmed that curved liquid-gas interfaces could even increase the surface friction <b>by</b> <b>protruding</b> <b>into</b> the channel flow area under vacuum conditions. The experimental slip length results from this study were overestimated by the slip scaling theory but compared well with results reported from similar studies in literature. Therefore, it was concluded the theoretical predictions may only be suitable for low pressure flow conditions. In order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the interfacial characteristics of SH surfaces in fluid filled microchannels, the surfaces were analysed using confocal microscopy. Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) provided a means of visualising the solid and fluid interactions in 3 D. The experimental results contradicted the surface stability theory and observed the presence of a partial wetting state on each surface, where the threephase contact line was situated below the micropillar tips. For the first time, experiments performed on various SH surfaces revealed the magnitude of the partial wetting may be related to the initial channel filling flow rate. From these observations it was hypothesised the partial wetting states were caused by contact line pinning along the hierarchical roughness on the pillar edges. The final section of this study focused on the reversible wetting and dewetting of SH surfaces. Controlled transitions between Wenzel (wetted) and Cassie-Baxter (dewetted) conditions would o er a means of dynamically tuning the influence of a SH surface and broaden their applicability in pressurised microfluidic systems. The ability to reversibly wet and dewet circular micropillar structures on a SH surface was demonstrated using an innovative application of dissolved gas control and surface heating. Lateral dewetting of the SH structures was achieved through the dissolution of dissolved gases from the working fluid. The process was limited by solid-liquid interface separation (bubble formations) on surface defects and contaminants. A novel method for increasing the liquid adhesion at the pillar tips was also implemented...|$|E

An axillo-iliac bypass was per-formed. Postoperatively, the patient developed ileus and acute renal failure, presumably caused by a steal phenomenon to the lower extremities.

Although thymomas are well-known causes of SVCS, cases of SVCS caused <b>by</b> malignant thymomas <b>protruding</b> <b>into</b> adjacent vessels draining the SVC with thrombosis have been very rarely reported worldwide. We experienced a 39 -year-old female patient with SVCS that developed after the direct invasion of the left brachiocephalic vein (LBCV) and SVC by an anterior mediastinal mass with a high maximum standardized uptake value on the chest computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography-CT. Based on these results, she underwent en bloc resection of the tumor, including removal of the involved vessels, and was eventually diagnosed as having a type B 2 thymoma permeating into the LBCV and SVC. We present this case as a very rare form of SVCS caused by an invasive thymoma...|$|R
50|$|A closed fieldline {{does not}} {{constitute}} a coronal loop; however, closed flux must be filled with plasma {{before it can be}} called a coronal loop. With this in mind, it becomes clear that coronal loops are a rarity on the solar surface, as the majority of closed-flux structures are empty. This means the mechanism that heats the corona and injects chromospheric plasma into the closed magnetic flux is highly localised. The mechanism behind plasma filling, dynamic flows and coronal heating remains a mystery. The mechanism(s) must be stable enough to continue to feed the corona with chromospheric plasma and powerful enough to accelerate and therefore heat the plasma from 6000 K to well over 1 MK over the short distance from the chromosphere and transition region to the corona. This is the very reason coronal loops are targeted for intense study. They are anchored to the photosphere, are fed <b>by</b> chromospheric plasma, <b>protrude</b> <b>into</b> the transition region and exist at coronal temperatures after undergoing intensive heating.|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{membranes}} {{of cardiac}} muscle cells were studied in 134 patients with cardiac hypertrophy of various causes. Abnormalities observed consisted of: a) increased foldings and convolutions; b) nuclear pseudoinclusions formed <b>by</b> cytoplasmic organelles <b>protruding</b> <b>into</b> saccular invaginations {{of the nuclear}} membranes, and c) intranuclear tubules. The increased foldings and convolutions of the nuclear membranes and the nuclear pseudoinclusions appear to result from synthesis of nuclear membranes in excess of that needed to accommodate the increase in nuclear volume which occurs in hypertrophy. Intranuclear tubules were found in 6 patients and consisted of tubular invaginations, 400 to 650 A in diameter, of the inner nuclear membranes into the nucleoplasm. Some of these tubules were straight and cylindrical, and were associated with a peripheral layer of marginated chromatin; others were not associated with chromatin, appeared coiled and followed irregular courses. Intranuclear tubules in cardiac muscle cells probably represent an extreme cellular response to the stimulus of hypertrophy...|$|R
40|$|Several subtypes of {{voltage-gated}} Na+ (NaV) {{channels are}} important targets for pain management. m-Conotoxins isolated from venoms of cone snails are potent and specific blockers of different NaV channel isoforms. The inhibitory effect of m-conotoxins on NaV channels has been examined extensively, but {{the mechanism of}} toxin specificity has not been understood in detail. Here the known structure of m-conotoxin PIIIA and {{a model of the}} skeletal muscle channel NaV 1. 4 are used to elucidate elements that contribute to the structural basis of m-conotoxin binding and specificity. The model of NaV 1. 4 is constructed based on the crystal structure of the bacterial NaV channel, NaVAb. Six different binding modes, in which the side chain of each of the basic residues carried <b>by</b> the toxin <b>protrudes</b> <b>into</b> the selectivity filter of NaV 1. 4, are examined in atomic detail using molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvent. The dissociation constants (Kd) computed for two selected binding modes in which Lys 9 or Arg 14 from the toxin <b>protrudes</b> <b>into</b> the filter of the channel are within 2 fold; both values in close proximity to those determined from dose response data for the block of NaV currents. To explore the mechanism of PIIIA specificity, a double mutant of NaV 1. 4 mimicking NaV channels resistant to m-conotoxins and tetrodotoxin is constructed and the binding of PIIIA to this mutant channel examined. The double mutation causes the affinity of PIIIA to reduce by two orders of magnitude...|$|R
40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} adenosine diphosphate/adenosine triphosphate (ADP/ATP) carrier {{has been}} recently crystallized in complex with its specific inhibitor carboxyatractyloside (CATR). In the crystal structure, the six-transmembrane helix bundle {{that defines the}} nucleotide translocation pathway is closed on the matrix side due to sharp kinks in the odd-numbered helices. The closed conformation is further sealed <b>by</b> the loops <b>protruding</b> <b>into</b> the matrix that interact through an intricate network of charge-pairs. To gain insight into its structural dynamics we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies of the ADP/ATP carrier with and without its cocrystallized inhibitor. The two trajectories sampled a conformational space around two different configurations characterized by distinct salt-bridge networks with a significant shift from inter- to intrarepeat bonding on the matrix side {{in the absence of}} CATR. Analysis of the geometrical parameters defining the transmembrane helices showed that even-numbered helices can undergo a face rotation, whereas odd-numbered helices can undergo a change in the wobble angle with a conserved proline acting as molecular hinge. Our results provide new information on the dynamical properties of the ADP/ATP carrier {{and for the first time}} yield a detailed picture of a stable carrier conformation in absence of the inhibitor...|$|R

40|$|In the homotrimeric OmpF porin from Escherichia coli, each {{channel is}} {{constricted}} <b>by</b> a loop <b>protruding</b> <b>into</b> the beta-barrel of the monomer {{about halfway through}} the membrane. The water-filled channels exist in open or closed states, depending on the transmembrane potential. For the transition between these conformations, two fundamentally different mechanisms may be envisaged: a bulk movement of the constriction loop L 3 or a redistribution of charges in the channel lumen. To distinguish between these hypotheses, nine mutant proteins were constructed {{on the basis of}} the high-resolution x-ray structure of the wild-type protein. Functional changes were monitored by measuring single-channel conductance and critical voltage of channel closing. Structural alterations were determined by x-ray analysis to resolutions between 3. 1 and 2. 1 A. Tethering the tip of L 3 to the barrel wall by a disulfide bridge (E 117 C/A 333 C), mobilizing L 3 by perturbing its interaction with the barrel wall (D 312 N, S 272 A, E 296 L), or deleting residues at the tip of the loop (Delta 116 - 120) did not alter appreciably the sensitivity of the channels to an external potential. A physical occlusion, due to a gross movement of L 3, which would cause the channels to assume a closed conformation, can therefore be excluded...|$|R

40|$|Background: The mere {{lifting of}} the maxillary sinus {{membrane}} <b>by</b> implants <b>protruding</b> <b>into</b> the sinus cavity allows {{the establishment of a}} void space for blood clot and new bone formation. Purpose: To evaluate bone formation by using a spherical, hollow, and perforated hydroxyapatite space-maintaining device (HSMD) in a two-stage sinus lift procedure where residual alveolar bone height was </= 2 mm. Material and Methods: Spherical, hollow, and perforated HSMDs with a diameter of 12 mm were manufactured for this pilot study. Three patients with a residual bone height of 1 - 2 mm, as verified clinically and radiographically, and in need of a sinus augmentation procedure prior to implant installation were selected for the study. The HSMD and bone formation was evaluated by cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT) 6 months after augmentation procedure. Implants were installed 6 to 9 months after augmentation. The implant sites were prepared by a trephine drill to obtain a specimen of HSMD and bone for histological evaluation. After implant installation, the condition of the sinus membrane adjacent to the HSMD was evaluated endoscopically. After an additional 8 weeks, fixed partial prostheses were fabricated. Results: Bone formation verified by CBCT was found around and inside the device in all three patients after 6 months. Despite the fact that residual bone before augmentation was </= 2 mm, 12 -mm-long implants with diameter of 4. 8 mm could be inserted with preservation of an intact and healthy sinus membrane verified endoscopically. Bone formation inside HSMDs was noted histologically in two out of three HSMDs. Implants were stable and without any marginal bone loss after 1 year of prosthetic loading. Conclusion: A spherical, hollow, and perforated HSMD used in sinus lift procedures can produce a void space for blood clot and new bone formation and subsequent implant installation...|$|R
