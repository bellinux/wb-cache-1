5000|$|A network {{analysis}} of weblogs connected to campaigning in the German federal election 2005 was, e.g., conducted by Steffen Albrecht, Maren Lübcke and Rasco Hartig-Perschke. 317 campaign weblogs by politicians and non-political actors were examined along three dimensions of analysis: activity, interactivity, and connectedness. The sample was selected using search engines, existing pertinent lists and the snowball approach. Some of the aspects that were analyzed are {{the quantity of}} postings by the <b>blog</b> <b>author,</b> the quantity of feedback received from readers and “the connectedness of weblogs by means of blogroll links”. [...] The {{network analysis}} revealed the network structure of the blogosphere, showing that the interconnection of blogs was not that prevalent during the 2005 election campaign. Out of the 317 examined campaign weblogs the “majority of the blogs (187, 59%) had no blogroll links to other campaign blogs”. Furthermore, party-oriented weblogs primarily link to weblogs of the same party.|$|E
40|$|Gender-based {{research}} on the language use in blogs {{has its roots in}} the long-standing notion that men and women speak and write differently. This paper reports an empirical study on the use of English in a blog context involving Malaysian <b>blog</b> <b>authors.</b> Specifically, the study aimed to identify gender-specific English use among Malaysian <b>blog</b> <b>authors</b> and determine the differences in the language use. Using an ensemble text analysis approach, Malaysian female <b>blog</b> <b>authors</b> are more inclined towards using more verbs, adverbs and pronouns than their male counterpart, with a significant difference, while the males are inclined towards using more adjectives, nouns, determiners and prepositions/subordinating conjunctions than the females, with a significant difference. There are also differences between females and males in terms of the function words, neologisms/blog words as well as use of tag questions and adverbs initiating sentences. However, there are minimal differences between the females and males in terms of length of sentences and that the use of intensifiers, hedges, empty adjectives and emotions, thus concluding that they are not necessarily gender-specific differences. The findings can serve as useful language markers that can benefit the applied linguistics and particularly gender-based and forensic linguistic research...|$|R

50|$|On January 13, 2016, a {{critical}} review of the book by librarian Edith Campbell was posted on the Facebook page of the Washington, DC-based nonprofit Teaching for Change, along with {{a photo of the}} book’s back cover. On this same day, Leslie MacFadyen of the National #Ferguson Response Network entered the conversation and developed the hashtag #slaverywithasmile. This took the discussion beyond the children’s literature world to parents, educators, and activists. It also caught the attention of major media outlets, including the Atlanta Black Star, The Root, and Fusion. Thousands signed a protest petition at Change.org. Food historian Michael W. Twitty critiqued historical elements of the book in The Guardian while author Steve Sheinkin discussed the book in an Actually podcast. Debbie Reese of American Indians in Children’s Literature—who had played a major role drawing public attention to the Mexican American studies ban in Tucson—documented the evolution of events on her <b>blog.</b> <b>Author</b> Daniel José Older tweeted about the book. Older's tweets, the petition, and a summary of the campaign were published on Common Dreams. The books controversy evolved into discussions about how to present enslavement in children’s books and censorship.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} article, we {{address the problem}} of {{automatic}} gender classification of web blog authors. More specifically, we employ eight widely used machine learning algorithms, in order to study the effectiveness of feature selection on improving the accuracy of gender classification. The feature ranking is performed over a set of statistical, part-of-speech tagging and language model features. In the experiments, we employed classification models based on decision trees, support vector machines and lazy-learning algorithms. The experimental evaluation performed on <b>blog</b> <b>author</b> gender classification data demonstrated the importance of language model features for this task and that feature selection significantly improves the accuracy of gender classification, regardless of the type of the machine learning algorithm used...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{automatically}} classifying {{the gender of}} a <b>blog</b> <b>author</b> has important applications in many commercial domains. Existing systems mainly use features such as words, word classes, and POS (part-ofspeech) n-grams, for classification learning. In this paper, we propose two new techniques to improve the current result. The first technique introduces {{a new class of}} features which are variable length POS sequence patterns mined from the training data using a sequence pattern mining algorithm. The second technique is a new feature selection method which is based on an ensemble of several feature selection criteria and approaches. Empirical evaluation using a real-life blog data set shows that these two techniques improve the classification accuracy of the current state-ofthe-art methods significantly. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} descriptive study {{was to develop a}} greater clarity of how HIV infected individuals live and work within the sphere of HIV infection as represented through unsolicited, personal narratives posted on blogs. Existing, single author, personal blogs were identified via a search engine. Blogs were defined as the <b>blog</b> <b>author</b> 2 ̆ 7 s postings and all responses, whether written by the <b>blog</b> <b>author</b> or a reader respondent. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed to respect indicators of bloggers 2 ̆ 7 intentions for privacy, e. g., blogs which required a password were excluded. A total of 14 blogs met inclusion criteria. Actions to promote validity focused on the areas of credibility, authenticity, criticality, and integrity. Throughout the blogs, online social connectedness formed the context for expression of the four themes identified to describe the experiences of the bloggers and their readers living with HIV infection. Suffering was the human experience of stigma related to living with HIV infection. This was primarily manifested in either self-imposed isolation or isolation resulting from rejection by others. Relationships addressed both the online and offline/in-person interactions experienced by the blog authors and their readers. These stories were predominantly about receiving support from persons via online interactions. Daily living with HIV dialogue addressed the common experiences shared by various bloggers and their readers such as longing for normalcy. A call to action addressed a self-embraced sense of mission or purpose which was a contributing impetus to blog. Blog readers affirmed these missions in their responses. While these themes have been documented in prior qualitative research on living with HIV infection, the opportunities for online social connectedness altered the expression of these themes. Further research using unsolicited narrative blogs is warranted...|$|E
40|$|We report new {{results on}} the {{relatively}} novel task of automatic classification of <b>blog</b> <b>author</b> personality. Promisingly high classification accuracies have recently been reported for four important personality traits (Extraversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness). But the blog corpus used in that work required careful preparation, and was consequently quite small (with {{less than a hundred}} authors; and less than half a million words). Here, we provide an initial report on the classification accuracies that can be achieved when classifiers conditioned on the small corpus are applied to a larger, automatically-acquired blog corpus, using lowergranularity personality data and substantially less manual preparation (with over a thousand bloggers, and approximately five million words). Predictably, {{results on the}} larger corpus are not as impressive as those on the smaller; nevertheless, they point the way forward for further work...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Current blog {{search engines}} use rankings, such as BIImpact or B 2 Rank, {{focusing}} on the link structure and other meta criteria externally extracted for blogs. A good, but due to the unavailability, not often used criteria is the visitor engagement. This metric can leverage {{the quality of a}} ranking extremely. For this reason, we propose to gather visitor information from blog authors by providing a new blog plugin. This plugin on the one hand tracks the visitor information {{and on the other hand}} provides important analysis information for the <b>blog</b> <b>author.</b> Finally, this leads into a win-win situation for both, the blog search engine and the blogger. The benefit of this plugin is to provide analytics based on the blog where the plugin is installed as well as analytics based on the whole community of bloggers. With this information a blogger is able to gain significant knowledge advantage. I...|$|E

40|$|The {{blogosphere}} {{has grown}} to be a mainstream forum of social interaction {{as well as a}} commercially attractive source of information and influence. Tools are needed to better understand how communities that adhere to individual blogs are constituted in order to facilitate new personal, socially-focused browsing paradigms, and understand how blog content is consumed, which is of interest to <b>blog</b> <b>authors,</b> big media, and search. We present a novel approach to blog subcommunity characterization by modeling individual blog readers using mixtures of an extension to the LDA family that jointly models phrases and time, Ngram Topic over Time (NTOT), and cluster with a number of similarity measures using Affinity Propagation. We experiment with two datasets: a small set of <b>blogs</b> whose <b>authors</b> provide feedback, and a set of popular, highly commented blogs, which provide indicators of algorithm scalability and interpretability without prior knowledge of a given blog. The results offer useful insight to the <b>blog</b> <b>authors</b> about their commenting community, and are observed to offer an integrated perspective on the topics of discussion and members engaged in those discussions for unfamiliar blogs. Our approach also holds promise as a component of solutions to related problems, such as online entity resolution and role discovery. <br /...|$|R
