5000|$|IRC is a {{historically}} favored means of C&C {{because of its}} communication protocol. A <b>bot</b> <b>herder</b> creates an IRC channel for infected clients to join. Messages sent to the channel are broadcast to all channel members. The <b>bot</b> <b>herder</b> may set the channel's topic to command the botnet. E.g. the message [...] from the <b>bot</b> <b>herder</b> alerts all infected clients belonging to #channel to begin a DDoS attack on the website www.victim.com. An example response [...] by a bot client alerts the <b>bot</b> <b>herder</b> that it has begun the attack.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of IRC botnets, {{infected}} clients connect to an infected IRC server and join a channel pre-designated for C&C by the <b>bot</b> <b>herder.</b> The <b>bot</b> <b>herder</b> sends commands to the channel via the IRC server. Each client retrieves the commands and executes them. Clients send messages back to the IRC channel {{with the results of}} their actions.|$|E
50|$|The first botnets on the {{internet}} used a client-server model to accomplish their tasks. Typically, these botnets operate through Internet Relay Chat networks, domains, or websites. Infected clients access a predetermined location and await incoming commands from the server. The <b>bot</b> <b>herder</b> sends commands to the server, which relays them to the clients. Clients execute the commands and report their results back to the <b>bot</b> <b>herder.</b>|$|E
50|$|One {{of the new}} <b>bot</b> <b>herders</b> {{includes}} the controller of Conficker.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to efforts {{to detect and}} decapitate IRC botnets, <b>bot</b> <b>herders</b> have begun deploying malware on peer-to-peer networks. These bots may use digital signatures so that only someone {{with access to the}} private key can control the botnet. See e.g. Gameover ZeuS and ZeroAccess botnet.|$|R
50|$|The {{operation}} {{was created to}} disrupt and disassemble <b>bot</b> <b>herders.</b> In June 2007, the FBI had identified about 1 million computers that were compromised, leading {{to the arrest of}} the persons responsible for creating the malware. In the process, owners of infected computers were notified, many of whom were unaware of the exploitation.|$|R
50|$|A <b>bot</b> <b>herder</b> usually uses a {{pseudonym}} to keep themselves anonymous, and may use proxy servers, shell accounts and bouncers to conceal their IP address thus maintaining anonymity.|$|E
50|$|Bot herders are hackers who use {{automated}} {{techniques to}} scan specific network ranges and find vulnerable systems, such as machines without current security patches, {{on which to}} install their bot program. The infected machine then {{has become one of}} many zombies in a botnet and responds to commands given by the <b>bot</b> <b>herder,</b> usually via an Internet Relay Chat channel.|$|E
5000|$|Spyware is {{software}} which sends {{information to}} its creators about a user's activities - typically passwords, {{credit card numbers}} and other {{information that can be}} sold on the black market. Compromised machines that are located within a corporate network can be worth more to the <b>bot</b> <b>herder,</b> as they can often gain access to confidential corporate information. Several targeted attacks on large corporations aimed to steal sensitive information, such as the Aurora botnet.|$|E
50|$|Operation: Bot Roast is an {{operation}} by the FBI {{to track down}} <b>bot</b> <b>herders,</b> crackers, or virus coders who install malicious software on computers through the Internet without the owners’ knowledge, which turns the computer into a zombie computer that then sends out spam to other computers from the compromised computer, making a botnet or network of bot infected computers. The operation was launched because the vast scale of botnet resources {{poses a threat to}} national security.|$|R
5000|$|Experts {{interviewed by}} IT {{security}} resource SearchSecurity.com [...] "say it's very unlikely {{this was a}} case of one government launching a coordinated cyberattack against another": Johannes Ullrich, chief research officer of the Bethesda said [...] "Attributing a distributed denial-of-service attack like this to a government is hard." [...] "It may as well be a group of <b>bot</b> <b>herders</b> showing 'patriotism,' kind of like what we had with Web defacements during the US-China spy-plane crisis 2001." [...] Hillar Aarelaid, manager of Estonia's Computer Emergency Response Team [...] "expressed skepticism that the attacks were from the Russian government, noting that Estonians were also divided on whether it was right to remove the statue".|$|R
40|$|Botnet ia a {{collection}} on network of bots. i. e {{the collection of}} zombie computers which are controlled by a single person or group known as <b>bot</b> master or <b>herder.</b> This paper focuses on botnet detection framework and proposed a generic framework for botnet detection. The proposed framework {{is based on the}} approach of passively monitoring network traffic. This paer also show the flow chart of Generic Framework...|$|R
50|$|Botnet {{architecture}} {{has evolved}} over time {{in an effort to}} evade detection and disruption. Traditionally, bot programs are constructed as clients which communicate via existing servers. This allows the <b>bot</b> <b>herder</b> (the person controlling the botnet) to perform all control from a remote location, which obfuscates their traffic. Many recent botnets now rely on existing peer-to-peer networks to communicate. These P2P bot programs perform the same actions as the client-server model, but they do not require a central server to communicate.|$|E
5000|$|In 2013, Bitdefender Labs {{caught and}} blocked the worm, which {{is capable of}} spying on users' {{browsing}} activities, meanwhile stealing their personal online/offline information and/or credentials, commonly known as cybercrime. The infection was originally flagged by the online backup service MediaFire, who detected that the worm was being distributed camouflaged as an image file. Despite the misleading extension, MediaFire successfully identified the malicious image as an [...]exe-file. The malicious Shikara Code poses as a [...]jpeg image but is indeed an executable file. As an IRC bot, the malware is simply integrated by the attackers from a control and command server. Besides stealing usernames and passwords, the <b>bot</b> <b>herder</b> may also order additional malware downloads.|$|E
50|$|One {{problem with}} using IRC {{is that each}} bot client must know the IRC server, port, and channel to be of any use to the botnet. Anti-malware {{organizations}} can detect and shut down these servers and channels, effectively halting the botnet attack. If this happens, clients are still infected, but they typically lie dormant since they {{have no way of}} receiving instructions. To mitigate this problem, a botnet can consist of several servers or channels. If one of the servers or channels becomes disabled, the botnet simply switches to another. It is still possible to detect and disrupt additional botnet servers or channels by sniffing IRC traffic. A botnet adversary can even potentially gain knowledge of the control scheme and imitate the <b>bot</b> <b>herder</b> by issuing commands correctly.|$|E
50|$|An {{internet}} bot is {{a program}} that infects a computer and enables remote control of that computer. A security vulnerability in the computer system is exploited by the hacker in order to install and run the malware; {{in this case a}} worm. The program installs itself and is set up to run as a background process or daemon which remains undetectable to the computer user. The infected computer {{is often referred to as}} a zombie computer and was what Ancheta depended on as the building block of his botnet army. Ancheta engaged these computers to function in unison in a network formation; this is referred to as a botnet and the controller is called the <b>bot</b> <b>herder.</b> Ancheta's primary purpose of engaging large numbers of computers was to amplify the attack and reduce the time taken to execute it. Their greatest value is they provide a relatively high level of anonymity.|$|E
40|$|Today’s Internet {{is widely}} {{spreading}} {{in every part}} of the world. As the number of internet users increasing, the number of people with bad desires increasing. Botnet is such a group of infected nodes on worldwide network. Bot master spread viruses and utilizes the network resources of the nodes, which have been contaminated or infected by <b>Bot</b> <b>herder.</b> Effect of this is to slow down the internet speed and illegal utilization of personal documents of bots. As the size of Botnet becomes large, {{it will be difficult to}} trace out the <b>Bot</b> <b>herder.</b> This research will hand out a preface to the Botnets, its major type Zeus Botnet and its sound effects on the network security. We also propose some ways to detect as well as remove the effect of Zeus Botnet to personal computers...|$|E
40|$|Honeypots are network {{surveillance}} architectures designed to resemble easy-to-compromise computer systems. They are deployed to trap hackers {{in order to}} help security professionals capture, control, and analyze malicious Internet attacks and other activities of hackers. A botnet is an army of compromised computers controlled by a <b>bot</b> <b>herder</b> and used for illicit financial gain. Botnets have become quite popular in recent Internet attacks. Since honeypots have been deployed in many defense systems, attackers constructing and maintaining botnets are forced to find ways to avoid honeypot traps. In fact, some researchers have even suggested equipping normal machines by misleading evidence so that they appear as honeypots in order to scare away rational attackers. In this paper, we address some aspects related to the problem of honeypot detection by botmasters. In particular, we show that current honeypot architectures and operation limitations may allow attackers to systematically collect, combine, and analyze evidence about {{the true nature of the}} machines they compromise. In particular, we show how a systematic technique for evidence combining such as Dempster-Shafer theory can allow botmasters to determine the true nature of compromised machines with a relatively high certainty. The obtained results demonstrate inherent limitations of current honeypot designs. We also aim to draw the attention of security professionals to work on enhancing the discussed features of honeypots in order to prevent them from being abused by botmasters...|$|E
40|$|A botnet {{is a large}} {{network of}} bots that are {{under the control of}} a <b>bot</b> <b>herder.</b> Botnets have become a {{significant}} threat to network communications and applications. Botnets' execution relies on Command and Control (C 2) communication channels traffic, which occur prior to the attack activity itself. Therefore, the detection of C 2 communication channels traffic enables the detection of the members of a botnet before any target is attacked. We study the periodic behavior of C 2 traffic that is caused by the pre-programmed behavior of bots to check for and download updates every T seconds. We use this periodic behavior of the C 2 traffic to detect bots. This involves evaluating the periodogram of traffic in the monitored network. Then applying Walker's large sample test to the maximum ordinate of the periodogram to determine if it is due to a high periodic component in the traffic or not, and, if it is, then it is bot traffic. We apply the test to a TinyP 2 P botnet generated by SLINGbot and show a strong periodic behavior in the bots traffic. We study the effect of the period's length and duty cycle of the C 2 traffic on the test performance and find that it increases with the increase of the duty cycle and/or the decrease of the period length. We analyze the test's performance in the presence of injected random noise traffic and develop a lower and an upper bounds for the test performance. ...|$|E
