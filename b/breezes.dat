5|$|The {{magnitude}} of winds offshore are {{nearly double the}} wind speed observed onshore. This is attributed to the differences in friction between land masses and offshore waters. Sometimes, there are even directional differences, particularly if local sea <b>breezes</b> change the wind on shore during daylight hours.|$|E
5|$|Eastbourne’s {{reputation}} for health, enhanced by bracing air and sea <b>breezes</b> {{contributed to the}} establishment of many independent schools in the 19th century and in 1871, the year which saw the arrival of Queenwood Ladies College, the town was just beginning a period of growth and prosperity. By 1896, Gowland’s Eastbourne Directory listed 76private schools for boys and girls. However, economic difficulties during the inter-war years saw a gradual {{decline in the number of}} independent schools.|$|E
5|$|In meteorology, {{winds are}} often {{referred}} to according to their strength, and the direction from which the wind is blowing. Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts. Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed squalls. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as , gale, storm, and hurricane. Wind occurs {{on a range of}} scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local <b>breezes</b> generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet (Coriolis effect). Within the tropics, thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations. In coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley <b>breezes</b> can dominate local winds.|$|E

50|$|Starting life as {{the medium}} wave {{frequencies}} of Essex Radio, the frequencies split in July 1989, when <b>Breeze</b> AM was born. It later changed name to simply <b>Breeze,</b> then The <b>Breeze.</b> In 1999, the GWR Group bought Essex Radio and <b>Breeze</b> became Classic Gold <b>Breeze</b> despite petitioning by locals. The word <b>Breeze</b> was later dropped as it {{became part of the}} Classic Gold Digital network.|$|R

5|$|The high-mass air well design {{attempts}} to cool a large mass of masonry with cool nighttime air entering the structure due to <b>breezes</b> or natural convection. In the day, {{the warmth of}} the sun results in increased atmospheric humidity. When moist daytime air enters the air well, it condenses on the presumably cool masonry. None of the high-mass collectors performed well, Knapen's aerial well being a particularly conspicuous example.|$|E
5|$|These {{can occur}} in sea <b>breezes</b> or in desert regions. In a sea-breeze front, cold air from the sea meets the warmer air from the land and creates a {{boundary}} between two masses of air like a shallow cold front. Glider pilots can gain altitude by flying along the intersection {{as if it were}} a ridge of land. Convergence may occur over considerable distances and so may permit virtually straight flight while climbing.|$|E

40|$|Typically virtual environments {{are created}} with visual and {{auditory}} stimuli. Less often, haptic stimulation is included as well, {{usually in the}} form of force-feedback and tactile manipulators. Another possible source of haptic stimulation is moving air. In order to generate a <b>breeze</b> in a virtual environment, we created a <b>breeze</b> cannon from readily-available components. We compared four conditions: no <b>breeze,</b> self-generated <b>breeze,</b> object-generated <b>breeze</b> and nature-generated <b>breeze.</b> Participants reported feeling more immersed in the virtual environment when the <b>breeze</b> was caused by their own movement. Anecdotal results also suggest that moving air may help decrease simulator sickness. 1...|$|R

5|$|Bertha's broad {{circulation}} produced high waves {{which were}} reported along the southeastern {{coast of the}} United States, in North Carolina, the storm produced waves of 25–50ft (7.6-15.2m). The waves caused minor beach erosion along the North Carolina coastline including the Outer Banks. In Florida, rip currents from Bertha caused two drowning fatalities. 200other swimmers were rescued from the rough seas. The vortex of Bertha forced warm air and blocked sea <b>breezes</b> from South Florida. As a result, record high temperatures were reported in West Palm Beach, Miami, Hollywood, and Miami Beach; temperatures also tied records in Fort Lauderdale. The extreme heat also shattered numerous sliding glass doors and exhausted several air conditioners.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, San Sebastian Church has {{encountered}} threats to its structural integrity. The steel structure has been beset by rust and corrosion due to sea <b>breezes</b> from nearby Manila Bay. State funding was accorded {{to the church}} through the National Historical Institute which undertook restoration in 1982. The Recollect community has likewise expended funds for the church's maintenance and restoration. In 1998, it {{was placed on the}} biennial watchlist of the 100 Most Endangered Sites by the World Monuments Fund, though it was not retained in the subsequent watchlists.|$|E
5|$|Short {{expressed}} {{his interest in}} residing in Beaumont, and was wealthy enough to buy a large allotment of land off the current landowner, Davenport. Between 1849 and 1851, he had Beaumont House designed and built on a large allotment {{at the end of}} Glynburn Road, a major road which serviced the suburb of Beaumont, and linked to more major roads running west into the city of Adelaide along the Adelaide Plains. The Beaumont House estate was given the name 'Claremont' by Short. The location, {{in the foothills of the}} Mount Lofty Ranges, was chosen to catch the cool <b>breezes</b> coming from the sea across the Adelaide Plains.|$|E

5|$|Although earlier {{theories}} {{postulated that}} large lakes formed from glacial meltwater, increased precipitation or decreased evaporation (or both) are today considered necessary for lake formation; a complete glacial melting {{would have had}} to occur in less than about a century to produce the required volume. The water volume would be insufficient to explain Lake Tauca's high water levels; however, some smaller lakes in the southern Altiplano probably expanded from glacial meltwater alone. The lake may have contributed to increased precipitation by influencing land <b>breezes.</b> According to strontium isotope data, there may have been little water exchange between Tauca's Uyuni and Coipasa basins. During the Coipasa lake cycle, the Coipasa-Uyuni and Poopó basins had a limited connection. Minor water-level fluctuations occurred during the lake's existence.|$|E
5|$|Further {{recognition}} {{came with}} the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer <b>Breezes,</b> at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung {{at the same time}} included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme... The details of the picture disclose untiring care.|$|E
5|$|The Temeraire {{became the}} subject of a number of poems and songs commemorating her life and fate. An early work by James Duff written between 1813 and 1819 {{referenced}} her role as a prison ship, and was set to music in 1857 under the title The Brave Old Temeraire. More generally, an anonymous poem entitled The Wooden Walls of Old England appeared in Fraser's Magazine shortly after Temeraires arrival at Rotherhithe, and lamented the fate of the great sailing warships. Turner's painting created an enduring interest in the story of the Temeraire and several poems appeared in the decades following her breaking up. Gerald Massey wrote The Fighting Temeraire Tugged to Her Last Berth, Herman Melville produced The Temeraire, and Henry Newbolt wrote The Fighting Temeraire, with its closing lines Now the sunset's <b>breezes</b> shiver,And she's fading down the river,But in England's song forever,She's the Fighting Temeraire.|$|E

5|$|The region's {{precipitation}} pattern is bimodal, meaning agriculture is sustained through snowfall during winter and autumn and rainfall during spring and summer. The climate is semi-arid. Water for farming and consumption {{was provided by}} summer rains, winter snowfall, and seeps and springs in and near the Mesa Verde villages. At , the middle mesa areas were typically ten degrees Fahrenheit (5.5°C) cooler than the mesa top, which reduced {{the amount of water}} needed for farming. The cliff dwellings were built to take advantage of solar energy. The angle of the sun in winter warmed the masonry of the cliff dwellings, warm <b>breezes</b> blew from the valley, and the air was ten to twenty degrees warmer in the canyon alcoves than {{on the top of the}} mesa. In the summer, with the sun high overhead, much of the village was protected from direct sunlight in the high cliff dwellings.|$|E
5|$|Toivonen's crash {{remains a}} mystery because it had no close witnesses. Although it was caught on tape by a spectator further down the stage, {{it proved to be}} {{impossible}} to determine the cause of the crash from the footage. No race marshalls were close to the scene to notice the black smoke and no-one at the race finish knew about the crash. Toivonen's team only started to fear something might have happened after he failed to arrive from the stage on schedule. The next rally crew through the stage then mentioned they had seen some black smoke. By the time the emergency vehicles arrived on the crash scene, they could only put down the flames, which had been fanned by <b>breezes.</b> Lancia engineers and technicians could not determine the cause of the crash because the remains of the car were so charred.|$|E
25|$|On calm summer afternoons {{with little}} {{prevailing}} wind, sea <b>breezes</b> from both coasts may collide in the middle, creating especially severe storms {{down the center}} of the state. These thunderstorms can drift towards either the west or east coast depending on the relative strengths of the sea <b>breezes,</b> and sometimes survive to move out over the water at night, creating spectacular cloud-to-cloud lightning shows for hours after sunset. Due to its large size Lake Okeechobee may also contribute to this activity by creating its own lake breeze which collides with the east and west coast sea <b>breezes.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to these winds, there is daily pattern of land <b>breezes</b> in the morning, followed by the onset of south-westerly sea <b>breezes</b> in the afternoon.

25|$|While the Hunter Valley {{is usually}} grouped {{in with the}} rest of Australia as having a Mediterranean climate, the climate is {{actually}} sub-tropical with distinctive maritime influences from the Pacific Ocean. With its northerly latitude and close oceanic influences, the Hunter Valley is one of Australia's hottest and wettest wine regions. Flanked by mountains to the west and north the Hunter Valley acts as a funnel, pulling cool ocean <b>breezes</b> into the area. This effect is similar to the cooling that Napa Valley receives from San Pablo Bay in California. Without these cooling <b>breezes,</b> quality wine grape production would be nearly impossible. However, with those cooling <b>breezes</b> also comes heavy rainfall and periodic cyclonic storms in the summer and autumn months.|$|E
