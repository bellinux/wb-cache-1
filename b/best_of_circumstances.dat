Organisms are only rarely preserved as fossils in the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances,</b> and {{only a fraction of}} such fossils have been discovered. Paleontologist Donald Prothero noted that this is illustrated {{by the fact that the}} number of species known through the fossil record was less than 5% of the number of known living species, suggesting that the number of species known through fossils must be far less than 1% of all the species that have ever lived.|$|E

Because of the specialized and rare circumstances required for a biological structure to fossilize, only a small percentage of life-forms can be expected to be represented in discoveries, and each discovery represents only a snapshot of the process of evolution. The transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, which will never demonstrate an exact half-way point.|$|E

Because collectors often doubt the reliability of written information, some believe certain physical aspects of the leaf can point to its cultivation. For example, drinkers cite the evidence of a truly wild old tree in a menthol effect ("camphor" [...] in tea specialist terminology) supposedly caused by the Camphor laurel trees that grow amongst wild tea trees in Yunnan's tea forests. As well, the presence of thick veins and sawtooth-edged on the leaves along with camphor flavor elements and taken as signifiers of wild tea.|$|E

60|$|This sally {{produced}} a hearty laugh, which rarely fails to establish momentary good fellowship. The Vaudois, {{who had the}} thirsty propensities of mountaineers, ordered wine, and, as their guardians looked upon their confinement more {{as a measure of}} temporary policy than of serious moment, the command was obeyed. In a short time, this little group of worldlings were making the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances,</b> by calling in the aid of physical stimulants to cheer their solitude.

60|$|It was {{not easy}} to recover this shock and make the visit unrestrained, even though Fanny had not been, under the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances,</b> the least trifle in the way. In such further {{communication}} as passed among them before the sisters took their departure, Little Dorrit fancied it was revealed to her that Mr Gowan treated his wife, even in his very fondness, too much like a beautiful child. He seemed so unsuspicious of the depths of feeling which she knew must lie below that surface, that she doubted if there could be any such depths in himself. She wondered whether his want of earnestness might be the natural result of his want of such qualities, and whether it was with people as with ships, that, in too shallow and rocky waters, their anchors had no hold, and they drifted anywhere.|$|E
60|$|The Briton {{had come}} out of the Cove of Cork, only a few days before, and was bound on service, with orders to run off to the westward, a few hundred miles, and to cruise three months in a {{latitude}} that might cover the homeward-bound running ships, from the American provinces, of which there were many in that early period of the war. This was not agreeable news to us, who had hoped to be landed somewhere immediately, and who had thought, at first, on seeing the ship carrying a press of sail to the westward that she might be going to Halifax. There was no remedy, however, and we were fain to make the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances.</b> Captain Rowley promised to put us on board the first vessel that offered, and that was as much as we had a right, to ask of him.|$|E

40|$|Migration, {{ethnicity}} and cultural pattern are reviewed. The research questions how accurately the prehistoric archaeologist can interpret migration and ethnicity {{by means of}} a review of the modern migration of a group of Russian sectarians to Baja California, Mexico. Excavations undertaken in seven households at different levels of assimilation with their Mexican and Indian neighbors suggests that material culture does reflect ethnicity under these <b>best</b> <b>of</b> all archaeological <b>circumstances.</b> A methodology for the determination of prehistoric migrations is suggested.

60|$|But it {{was clearly}} her duty to make the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> her present <b>circumstances,</b> and she went down-stairs with a smiling face and with {{pleasant}} words on her tongue. When she entered the breakfast-room Captain Aylmer was there; but Martha was there also, and her pleasant words were received indifferently {{in the presence of}} the servant. When the old woman was gone, Captain Aylmer assumed a grave face, and began a serious little speech which he had prepared. But he broke down in the utterance of it, and was saying things very different from what he had intended before he had completed it.|$|R
60|$|But he did {{not notice}} what she said. His eyes were {{following}} a figure {{which seemed to be}} escaping up through the birches behind the snow castle and ploughing its way through the drifts; in front of the structure they had been levelled to make an easier battle-field. He knew that it was Miss Shirley, and he inferred that she had been in the castle directing the farm--hands building it, and now, being caught by the premature arrival of the contesting forces, had fled before them and left her subordinates to finish the work. He felt, with a throe of helpless sympathy, that she was undertaking too much. It was hazardous enough to attempt the practice of her novel profession under the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances,</b> but to keep herself in abeyance so far as not to be known at all in it, and, at the same time, to give way to her interest in it to the extent of coming out, with her infirmly established health, into that wintry weather, and superintending the preparations for the first folly she had planned, was a risk altogether too great for her.|$|E
60|$|The {{singular}} felicity, {{with which}} Ishmael had contrived {{to shift the}} responsibility of all that had passed, from his own shoulders to those of his prisoners, backed as it was by circumstances that hardly admitted of a very philosophical examination of any mooted point in ethics, was sufficiently embarrassing to the several individuals, who were so unexpectedly required to answer for a conduct which, in their simplicity, they had deemed so meritorious. The life of Obed had been so purely theoretic, that his amazement was not the least embarrassing at a state of things which might not have proved so very remarkable had he been a little more practised {{in the ways of}} the world. The worthy naturalist was not the first by many, who found himself, at the precise moment when he was expecting praise, suddenly arraigned, to answer for the very conduct on which he rested all his claims to commendation. Though not a little scandalised, at the unexpected turn of the transaction, he was fain to make the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances,</b> and to bring forth such matter in justification, as first presented itself to his disordered faculties.|$|E
60|$|It {{would be}} a poor service to spread culture, if this be its result, among the {{comparatively}} innocent and cheerful ranks of men. When our little poets have {{to be sent to}} look at the ploughman and learn wisdom, we must be careful how we tamper with our ploughmen. Where a man in not the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances</b> preserves composure of mind, and relishes ale and tobacco, and his wife and children, in the intervals of dull and unremunerative labour; where a man in this predicament can afford a lesson by the way to what are called his intellectual superiors, there is plainly something to be lost, as well as something to be gained, by teaching him to think differently. It is better to leave him as he is than to teach him whining. It is better that he should go without the cheerful lights of culture, if cheerless doubt and paralysing sentimentalism are to be the consequence. Let us, by all means, fight against that hide-bound stolidity of sensation and sluggishness of mind which blurs and decolorises for poor natures the wonderful pageant of consciousness; let us teach people, as much as we can, to enjoy, and they will learn for themselves to sympathise; but let us see to it, above all, that we give these lessons in a brave, vivacious note, and build the man up in courage while we demolish its substitute, indifference.|$|E

"You are severe on both parties," [...] Mr. Porson {{said with}} a slight smile; [...] "but I can hardly blame you, my boy, for feeling {{somewhat}} bitter at first; but I hope that, for your own sake and your mother's, you will try and conquer this feeling and will make the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> the <b>circumstances.</b> It is worse than useless to kick against the pricks. Any show of hostility on your part will only cause unhappiness, perhaps between your mother' and him--almost certainly between you and her. In this world, my boy, we have all our trials. Some are very heavy ones. This is yours. Happily, so far as you are concerned, you need only look forward to its lasting eighteen months or so.

60|$|Deigning no reply, Bickley {{walked away}} to fetch some fine fish {{which had been}} washed up by the tidal wave and were still {{flapping}} about in a little pool of salt water. Then we took counsel {{as to how to}} make the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> our <b>circumstances,</b> and as a result set to work to tidy up the saloon and cabins, which was not difficult as what remained of the ship lay on an even keel. Also we got out some necessary stores, including paraffin for the swinging lamps with which the ship was fitted in case of accident to the electric light, candles, and the guns we had brought with us so that they might be handy in the event of attack. This done, by the aid of the tools that were in the storerooms, Bickley, who was an excellent carpenter, repaired the saloon door, all that was necessary to keep us private, as the bulkhead still remained.|$|R
50|$|Wang {{a native}} Kaifeng, was {{captured}} by the Kitans in 1003 {{at the battle of}} Wang-Tu. The Kitan emperor awarded Wang with official rank in the Kitan bureaucracy. Wang made the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> his <b>circumstances</b> and spoke with the Kitans of the advantage of resolving their conflict with the Sung peacefully. The dowager empress Ch'eng-t'ien, who was in actual control of the Kitan state at the time, had grown tired of war, and she listened to Wang's proposals. With the Liao empress dowager’s approval, Wang submitted a memorial to the Sung emperor through the Sung prefect of Mochou, stating that the Liao court wished to restore friendly relations. So, Wang facilitated the first talks of peace between the two empires. He had inside information for both of the empires so he knew exactly what each of them wanted in return for peace so he proposed exactly that to both sides. In the end it was Wang who persuaded the empress to give up on her land claims which ultimately lead to the treaty of Shan-Yuan.|$|R
