40|$|We analyze {{collusion}} in an infinitely repeated {{version of}} a standard auction with a continuum of types. Because {{of the lack of}} efficiency results in this setting the literature has focused on determining and comparing benchmarks on how well bidders can collude. Aoyagi (2003) has shown that the bidders can improve upon static <b>bid</b> <b>rotation,</b> making use of a dynamic <b>bid</b> <b>rotation</b> scheme, but this scheme does not allow to determine how much bidders can improve upon <b>bid</b> <b>rotation.</b> In this paper we design a very simple dynamic mechanism that improves upon static <b>bid</b> <b>rotation</b> and in the limit recovers one third of the gap between static <b>bid</b> <b>rotation</b> and efficiency, independently of the underlying distribution of values.

40|$|We study {{infinitely}} repeated first-price auctions {{in which}} a bidder only learns {{whether or not he}} won the object. While repetition of the stage-game equilibrium is the unique Nash equilibrium in public strategies, with patient bidders there are simple Nash equilibria in private strategies that improve on <b>bid</b> <b>rotation.</b> Sequential rationality is appropriately captured by essentially perfect Bayesian equilibrium (EPBE), which ignores behavior after irrelevant histories.

40|$|We study {{collusion}} in repeated first-price auctions {{under the}} condition of minimal information release by the auctioneer. In each auction a bidder only learns {{whether or not he}} won the object. Bidders do not observe other bidders’ bids, who participates or who wins in case they are not the winner. We show that for large enough discount factors collusion can nevertheless be supported in the infinitely repeated game. While there is a unique Nash equilibrium in public strategies, in which bidders bid competitively in every period, there are simple Nash equilibria in private strategies that support <b>bid</b> <b>rotation.</b> Equilibria that either improve on <b>bid</b> <b>rotation</b> or satisfy the requirement of Bayesian perfection, but not both, are only slightly more complex. Our main result is the construction of perfect Bayesian equilibria that improve on <b>bid</b> <b>rotation.</b> These equilibria require complicated inferences off the equilibrium path. A deviator may not know who has observed his deviation and consequently may have an incentive to use strategic experimentation to learn about the bidding behavior of his rivals...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{investigate}} whether there is bid collusion within the Swedish generic drugs market. Two types of collusion are considered: <b>bid</b> <b>rotation</b> and parallel bidding. <b>Bid</b> <b>rotation</b> means that companies take turns in winning the auction. Parallel bidding, on the other hand, means that two (or more) companies charge the same price every month and hence win together, sharing the market. The data used has been obtained from Tandvårds- och Läkemedelsförmånsverket (TLV) and contains monthly bids on over 1900 drugs for the years 2010 - 2015. The thesis presents a new method of identifying bid collusion, based on {{the investigation of the}} series of winners over time. The strategy is to test if a sequence of winners is random. The test identifies 231 products with suspicious bidding patterns (<b>bid</b> <b>rotation</b> or parallel bidding), which constitutes around 25 % of all products for which there is data for at least 30 months. The average price of products marked as suspicious is on average 5 times higher than a comparable product with many bidders. The isolated impact of collusion according to the difference-in-difference methodology is 47 % price increase and the estimated cost to the society is 148 million SEK at the minimum.

40|$|This paper studies bidder {{collusion}} with {{communication in}} repeated auctions when no side transfer is possible. It presents a simple dynamic <b>bid</b> <b>rotation</b> scheme which coordinates bids based on communication history and enables intertemporal transfer of bidders' payoffs. The paper derives a sufficient condition {{for such a}} dynamic scheme to be an equilibrium and characterizes the equilibrium payoffs in a general environment with affiliated signals and private or interdependentvalues. With IPV, it is shown that this dynamic scheme yields a strictly higher payoff to the bidders than any static collusion scheme which coordinates bids based only on the current reported signals...|$|E

40|$|We study bidder {{collusion}} {{and test}} the power of payoff dominance as an equilibrium selection principle in experimental multi-object ascending auctions. In these institutions low-price collusive equilibria exist along with competitive payoff-inferior equilibria. Achieving payoff-superior collusive outcomes requires complex strategies that, depending on the environment, may involve signalling, market splitting, and <b>bid</b> <b>rotation.</b> We provide the first systematic evidence of successful bidder collusion in such complex environments without communication. The results demonstrate that in repeated settings bidders are often able to coordinate on payoff-superior outcomes, with the choice of collusive strategies varying systematically with the environment.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the question of}} tacit collusion in repeated auctions with independent private values and with limited public monitoring. McAfee and McMillan show that the extent of collusion is tied to availability of transfers. Monetary transfers allow cartels to extract full surplus. A folk theorem proved by Fudenberg at al. shows that transfers of future payoffs are almost as good if players are patient and communicate before auctions. We ask how the scope of collusion is affected if players dispense with explicit communication. Collusion better than <b>bid</b> <b>rotation</b> is still feasible, but full surplus cannot be extracted. This constraint becomes less severe with more players and large cartels can become asymptotically efficient even with very limited monitoring. (This paper is a revise...|$|E
40|$|This paper studies bidder {{collusion}} in repeated auctions {{with general}} affiliated signals and correlated/private values. First, {{it shows that}} the maximal (efficient) collusion is possible with side transfer between bidders and derives the optimal transfer rule. Next, it shows that a certain degree of collusion can be sustained even without side transfer when bids are dynamically rotated. The collusive payoff from such a dynamic <b>bid</b> <b>rotation</b> scheme is compared to that from a static scheme based only on current signals.

Introduction The importance of understanding bidder collusion in auctions is well recognized in the light of strong evidence for such behavior in various auction markets.

40|$|We study tacit {{collusion}} in repeated auctions in which bidders can only observe past winners and not their bids. We adopt a stringent interpretation of {{tacit collusion}} as collusion without communication about strategies that we model as a symmetry restriction on repeated game strategies: Strategies cannot discriminate among initially nameless bidders {{until they have}} become named through winning an auction. We obtain three classes of results: (1) Completely refraining from using names, i. e. strengthening the symmetry constraint, rules out collusion altogether, and even if naming is permitted, as per our definition of tacit collusion, the lack of communication limits collusive strategies and payoffs among impatient bidders. (2) If communication is allowed, there are sustained improvements over <b>bid</b> <b>rotation</b> and competitive bidding among patient bidders. (3) These gains extend to tacit collusion among patient bidders. However, whether tacit or not, collusion need not be efficient...|$|E
40|$|Deficiency: ring manager {{must be able}} to act as budget breaker. Extension to an “expected {{externality}} mechanism ” in {{the spirit}} of D’Aspremont and Gérard-Varet (1979) that is always budget balancing and extracts the full surplus: Mailath and Zemsky (1991); see also McAfee and McMillan (1992). Deficiency: these mechanisms require communication and side payments which may involve a high risk of detection. 1 Moreover, side payment may attract parasite bidders who participate in the auction only in order to earn a piece of cake of collusion. 2 Collusion in one-shot auctions without side payments If no side payments are employed, auction rings cannot benefit unless it abandons efficiency of the allocation (see McAfee and McMillan (1992)). <b>Bid</b> <b>rotation</b> is a profitable mechanism without side payments. Indeed, ring profits are maximized if each ring member wins with equal probability (provided hazard rate monotonicity holds).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} bidding in auctions {{for state}} highway construction contracts on Long Island {{in the early}} 1980 s, {{in order to determine}} whether bid rigging occurred. Detection of collusion is possible because of limited participation in the collusive scheme. The paper looks at differences in behavior between ring members and non-members. In these auctions, collusio did not {{take the form of a}} <b>bid</b> <b>rotation</b> scheme, in which only one ring member submits a bid. Instead, several ring members bid on most jobs. The apparent role of ring meetings prior to the auction was to designate a serious bidder, and its bid, and the other firms then frequently submitted phony higher bids. The bidding data indicate that the bids of non-cartel firms, as well as their rank distribution, were related to cost measures, such as how much backlog a firm was carrying. In contrast, the rank distribution of higher cartel bids was unrelated to similar cost measures, and differed from the distribution of the low cartel bid. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method to detect bid-rigging by {{applying}} mutually reinforcing screens to a road construction procurement data set from Switzerland in which no prior information about collusion was available. The screening method is particularly suited {{to deal with the}} problem of partial collusion, i. e. collusion which does not involve all firms and/or all contracts in a specific data set, implying that many of the classical markers discussed in the corresponding literature will fail to identify bid-rigging. In addition to presenting a new screen for collusion, it is shown how benchmarks and the combination of different screens may be used to identify subsets of suspicious contracts and firms in a data set. The discussed screening method succeeds in isolating a group of “suspicious” firms exhibiting the characteristics of a local bid-rigging cartel operating with cover bids and a – more or less pronounced – <b>bid</b> <b>rotation</b> scheme. Based on these findings the Swiss Competition Commission (ComCo) decided to open an investigation...|$|E
40|$|We {{experimentally}} study tacit bidder collusion in open ascending auctions for two heterogeneous {{objects in}} environments {{with or without}} complementarities. While low-price collusive equilibria {{have been shown to}} exist under such institutions in theory, they require sophisticated tacit coordination among bidders that may be difficult to achieve in practice. We provide the first systematic evidence of successful bidder collu-sion in such complex environments. Stable collusion is often observed in markets with or without complementarities, as long as the number of bidders is small. We further find that bidder choice of collusive strategies is sensitive to the presence of comple-mentarities. While bidders make extensive use of signaling in no complementarity environments, in the presence of complementarities, they often adopt higher-payoff <b>bid</b> <b>rotation</b> strategies that are supported only by repeated play. Retaliatory bidding is widely used to punish non-collusive behavior of others. ∗Financial support by the Australian Research Council and the Krumrine Endowment is gratefully acknowledged.

40|$|Cooperation among {{players is}} often a good deed to pursue. The famous "Prisoner’s Dilemma" in game theory {{has long been an}} example of showing how {{non-cooperation}} results because of conflict of interest among agents. My thesis investigates how factors like imperfect public monitoring, emergence of an external threat influences the cooperative behaviors among players in dynamic environments. Chapter 1 investigates bidder collusion in repeated procurement auctions without communication or side payments, focusing on the case of bidders having identical costs under imperfect public monitoring where only winners, not bids, are publicly observed. It presents a simple <b>bid</b> <b>rotation</b> scheme, in which bidders take turns entering bids equal to the auction’s reserve price. This behavior is supported by the threat of a bidding war, i. e. if an auction is won by the wrong bidder, all bidders will enter bids equal to their common production cost in all future auctions. <b>Bid</b> <b>rotation</b> maximizes the bidders’ joint profits and is a perfect public equilibrium if and only if the discount factor is {{greater than or equal to}} a critical value, call it delta. This paper presents two main results. First, except for a measure zero set of discount factors, joint profit maximization cannot be achieved for discount factors below delta by any profile of bidding strategies. Second, in the case of two bidders, there is no profile of bidding strategies that achieves joint profit maximization for discount factors less than or equal to delta. Chapter 2 investigates a situation where firms selling different products refer mis- allocated customers to one another. Under monitoring over each other’s sales in every period, we analyze firm referrals in an infinitely repeated game with by looking at a class of “k + 1 punishment schemes”, in which players “forgive” the first k bad signals, and “punish” each other forever after the k + 1 ’s bad signal. We characterize the unique optimal k in this class of schemes. Chapter 3 is an empirical paper that models the impacts of telemarketing calls for selling bank long-term deposits. We use a dataset from a Portuguese retail bank from 2008 to 2013. This dataset contains features related to the calls and customers. We model a binary response of the outcome of the telemarketing call (yes or no) using those features. In second part of the paper, we propose methods to model price elasticity of demand (PED), which measures sensitivity of the long-term deposits resulting from changing interest rates. In estimating the PEDs, propensity-score-matching is used to adjust for potential group differentiation. Chapter 4 studies alliance behavior under external threat. When an alliance faces danger of appropriation from an external enemy, it is optimum for its members to jointly invest in their defense. For members to behave collusively in the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE), each of them has to be allocated with some minimum share of that resource. Under proportion-to-share rule of cost contribution and profit earning, this paper looks at how that minimum share requirement changes after the emergence of the external threat. We find that two factors, alliance size and cost factor contribute to the stability of the alliance in opposite directions. Further, force from more costly investment outweighs the force from increasing alliance size, which makes the alliance easier to maintain...|$|E
