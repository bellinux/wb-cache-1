40|$|Background: Motivation {{for this}} study was found in concern {{expressed}} by civil aviation organisations that specialists <b>in</b> the <b>air</b> navigation services provider sector require appropriate and beneficial organisational leadership to encourage, enable and manage transformation within this highly structured setting. Also, academic research puts emphasis on a need for investigations of the roles, expectations and requirements of followers in the leadership–followership relationship. Followers’ experiences and expectations of leadership <b>behaviours</b> <b>in</b> an <b>air</b> navigation service provider (ANSP) organisation were investigated and served as orientation and setting applicable to this study. Aim: The aim of the research was to identify and understand how follower experiences and expectations of leadership <b>behaviours</b> <b>in</b> a safety-critical commercial environment can affect leadership training and growth. The above-mentioned motivated this investigation of leadership traits and behaviours within an explicit context and from a follower’s viewpoint. Setting: The setting for the study was twenty two Air Traffic and Navigation Services Company sites where followers’ experiences and expectations of leadership <b>behaviours</b> <b>in</b> an <b>air</b> navigation service provider (ANSP) organisation were investigated and served as orientation and setting applicable to this study. Methods: An ethnographic case study research style was adopted and followed because it allowed for an all-inclusive, holistic narrative report and interpretation. The samples for the quantitative and qualitative components of this study were parallel and methods employed addressed different aspects of the phenomenon, which allowed for a mixed methods research design. A one-way causality in the research design was observed because traits of followers that might influence leaders’ behaviours were excluded. Data were collected by means of a Leader Trait and Behaviour Questionnaire completed by participants, individual interviews and focus group consultations. Results: Research findings dispensed a deeper appreciation of followers’ epistemological and ontological views, within a specified context, which were supported by a common need to achieve organisational safety objectives. A practical managerial benefit was found in the insights presented by followers of leadership, which can possibly benefit leadership development and training needs, along with training and advancement of followers. Conclusions: Research findings potentially add to enhancing understanding of leadership development theory, synonymous with a safety-critical commercial setting.

The present paper {{focuses on the}} oxidation <b>behaviour</b> <b>in</b> dry <b>air</b> at temperature of 700 ºC with respect to oxidation kinetics. Solution treatment was applied to Fe- 33 Ni- 19 Cr alloy by means of different solution annealing temperature to alter the average grain size of the specimens.

Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed in this study to analyse the oxidation behaviour of solution-annealed samples. Smaller grain size improves the protective oxidation behaviour by enhancing spallation resistance and reducing oxidation rate.

40|$|The {{oxidation}} <b>behaviour</b> <b>in</b> <b>air</b> of 12 mu m diameter continuous alloy 601 fibres {{has been}} studied using thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) for kinetics identification and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for determination {{of the nature of}} the oxide layers. The TGA allows two stages in the formation of the oxide layer to be distinguished: the first stage corresponds to the growth of a continuous layer of NiO above a discontinuous sub-layer of Cr 2 O 3 whereas the second stage is attributed to the parabolic growth of the Cr 2 O 3 sub-layer, from the time it becomes continuous. A third stage can be observed for high oxidation temperatures. The TEM observations of oxide layers formed after 30 min at 650, 750 and 900 degrees C confirm these results. One common characteristic of these 3 oxidation conditions is the appearance of large cavities under the oxide layer.

To obtain data with minimum perturbation to the characteristics of the blades, a Fibre Bragg Grating-based sensor network system was designed and implemented, for the first time. The individual vibration frequencies at each measurement point and thus the broader vibration patterns seen for each of the blades were obtained, with excitation both <b>in</b> <b>air</b> and <b>in</b> water and the results are compared favourably with those obtained from Finite Element (FE) analysis.

The pioneering graphite burning experiments of Don Schweitzer are successfully reevaluated. Ignition conditions are examined, and it is underlined that burning depends not only on graphite properties {{but also on the}} heat balance in the whole graphite arrangement. In graphite-moderated reactors, ignition occurs at about 650 °C for small air flow rates: this means that normal operation temperatures in HTRs always allow for ignition.

The exposures up to 6000 hours showed that the Ag additions promote formation of long-term protective alumina surface scales on gamma -TiAl alloys. Extensive analyses of the oxidation products using optical metallography, SEM/EDX, XRD, EPMA and SIMS revealed that Ag stabilises the Z-phase (Ti 5 Al 3 O 2) in the sub-scale depletion layer thereby preventing formation of alpha(2) -Ti 3 Al as well as Ti-rich nitrides, which {{are responsible for the}} destruction of alumina surface scales in common gamma-TiAl alloys.

The 2 - 3 mm thick deposit was grown in two stages. The {{first half of the}} deposit was mechanically worked during the process and then, deposition went on without this flailing period. The microstructure of the deposit can be divided into two parts. each one involving half of the total thickness. The oxidation resistance is strongly affected by the microstructure of the deposit, flailed or unflailed. Unflailed part of the deposit presents open boundaries with a high density of defects. Internal oxidation can proceed through this kind of boundaries. This is the reason of anomalous behaviour during the initial stages of oxidation, with maximum mass gain at 350 °C.

40|$|The {{utilization}} {{of energy in}} office building is mostly for create comfort and health for employee to work. However, it always consume energy excessively which is caused from the {{utilization of}} air-conditioning. The high demand of energy adopted from air-conditioning is to dilute indoor air particle. This article is about a parametric study of inlet air supply position for identifying the effectiveness of airflow behaviour of a room to dilute indoor air particle. It was carried out using COMSOL Multiphysics software of modelling and simulation approach. In simulation stage, the first process was to simulate the airflow behavior and the second was to assess its behaviour to dilute indoor air particle. Results from the simulation indicated that effectiveness of airflow <b>behaviour</b> <b>in</b> diluting indoor <b>air</b> particle are affected by inlet air supply position, outlet position and barrier condition in the room. Thus, these indicate that to improve IAQ of a room it needs to properly understand the airflow behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The {{perovskite}} oxide Pr 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 Cr 0. 9 Ni 0. 1 O 3 -delta was synthesised by a corribustion method. Pr 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 Cr 0. 9 Ni 0. 1 O 3 -delta {{obtained at}} 1400 degrees C {{has been shown}} to have an orthorhombic structure with space group Pnma (62), a= 5. 4388 (1) angstrom, b= 7. 6969 (1) angstrom, c= 5. 4584 (1) angstrom, V= 228. 50 (1) angstrom(3) according to X-ray diffraction. The material is redox stable and maintains its structure in a reducing atmosphere. After reducing in 5 % H- 2 at 900 degrees C for 190 h, Pr 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 Cr 0. 9 Ni 0. 1 O 3 -delta Still exhibits an orthorhombic structure. A lattice volume expansion of 0. 61 % was observed during the reduction, which may be attributed to reduction of Pr, Cr and Ni ions accompanying loss of lattice oxygen. TGA analysis and EDS indicate Pr 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 Cr 0. 9 Ni 0. 1 O 3 -delta shows enhanced resistance to nickel reduction. The conductivities of this material <b>in</b> <b>air</b> and 5 % H- 2 were 27. 4 and 1. 37 S/cm respectively at 900 degrees C. Pr 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 Cr 0. 9 Ni 0. 1 O 3 -delta exhibits semiconductor <b>behaviour</b> <b>in</b> both <b>air</b> and 5 % H- 2. The anode polarisation resistance of Pr 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 Cr 0. 9 Ni 0. 1 O 3 -delta reached 0. 98 Omega cm(2) at 900 degrees C in wet H- 2 but still not good enough as a good SOFC anode although it could be further improved by optimisation of microstructure.

40|$|Encouraging {{positive}} public {{behaviour change}} has been touted as a pathway for mitigating the climate impacts of air travel. There is, however, growing evidence that two gaps, one between attitudes and behaviour, and the other between practices of “home” and “away”, pose significant barriers to changing discretionary air travel behaviour. This article uses both modern sociological theory on tourism as liminoid space, and postmodern theory that views identities as contextual, to provide {{a deeper understanding of}} why these gaps occur in the context of tourism spaces. Based on 50 in-depth consumer interviews in Australia, Norway and the United Kingdom, our findings confirm that tourism spaces are often subject to lower levels of environmental concern than daily domestic contexts. The majority of participants reduced, suppressed or abandoned their climate concern when in tourism spaces, and rationalised their resulting behavioural contradictions. Only a minority held {{there was no difference between}} the environmental sustainability of their practices in domestic situations versus those on holiday. These findings suggest that scope for voluntary positive <b>behaviour</b> change <b>in</b> the <b>air</b> travel context is limited and will not come without stronger intervention, which is a key finding for policy makers seeking reductions <b>in</b> <b>air</b> travel’s climate impacts.
