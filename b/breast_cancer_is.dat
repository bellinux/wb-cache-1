5|$|<b>Breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> the secondest common {{cancer in}} the world and the commonest amongst women, as well as being amongst the ten commonest chronic {{diseases}} of women, and a substantial contributor to loss of quality of life (Gronowski and Schindler, Table IV). Globally, it accounts for 25% of all cancers. In 2016, <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> the commonest cancer diagnosed amongst women in both developed and developing countries, accounting for nearly 30% of all cases, and worldwide accounts for one and a half million cases and over half a million deaths, being the fifth commonest cause of cancer death overall and the second in developed regions. Geographic variation in incidence is the opposite of that of cervical cancer, being highest in Northern America and lowest in Eastern and Middle Africa, but mortality rates are relatively constant, resulting in a wide variance in case mortality, ranging from 25% in developed regions to 37% in developing regions, and with 62% of deaths occurring in developing countries.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Russos' studies found similar risk rates between virgin and {{pregnancy}} interrupted rats, their research would be used to support the contention that abortion created a greater risk of breast cancer for the next twenty years.

5|$|There {{have been}} a few {{instances}} of general population poisoning as the result of long-term exposure to cadmium in contaminated food and water, and research into an estrogen mimicry that may induce <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> ongoing. In the decades leading up to World War II, mining operations contaminated the JinzÅ« River in Japan with cadmium and traces of other toxic metals. As a consequence, cadmium accumulated in the rice crops along the riverbanks downstream of the mines. Some members of the local agricultural communities consumed the contaminated rice and developed itai-itai disease and renal abnormalities, including proteinuria and glucosuria.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fifteen {{patients}} with bilateral <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>were</b> clinically analyzed {{on the basis}} of a result of surgical treatment, in whom eight patients had bilateral synchronous <b>breast</b> <b>cancer,</b> four <b>were</b> non-synchronous and the remaining three <b>were</b> metastatic <b>breast</b> <b>cancer,</b> respectively. The prognosis of {{patients with}} bilateral <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>was</b> not pessimistic, indicating that it depended on the disease stages of each cancer. On the other hand, it was emphasized that the prognosis of patients with bilateral metastatic <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>was</b> extremely poor. Surgeons should be aware of high risk of contralateral <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> in careful follow-up following mastectomy for <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> It <b>is</b> generally accepted that patients with <b>cancer</b> of one <b>breast</b> have a higher than average risk of developing cancer of the opposite breast. It is not so rare that bilateral breast tumors are seen in an identical patient on account of the effectiveness of high resolution mammography and sonography in early detection. It is known that a <b>cancer</b> of one <b>breast</b> means the most frequent precancerous lesion of the opposite <b>breast.</b> Bilateral <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> may occur in any of the following ways...|$|R
40|$|In 2004, <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> account-ed {{for more}} than 90, 000 {{hospital}} stays among women, represent-ing {{a significant decrease in}} the rate of hospitalization for this disease since 1997. Hospital costs for the treatment of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> totaled $ 605 million in 2004. Compared with the average non-obstetrical hospital stay, admissions for <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>were</b> significantly shorter, though more costly per inpatient day, and more likely to occur among older women. Forty-five percent of the women hospitalized for <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>were</b> between the ages of 45 and 64, while women ages 65 to 84 accounted for 36 percent of stays for <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> Nearly 85 percent of all hospital stays for <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>were</b> billed to private insurance and Medicare, reflecting the most common sources of payment for women ages 45 to 84.

25|$|The use of {{mammography}} in universal {{screening for}} <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> controversial {{as it may}} not reduce all-cause mortality and for causing harms through unnecessary treatments and medical procedures.

In the United States screening mammography women at normal risk for <b>breast</b> <b>cancer,</b> <b>is</b> only recommended every two years in {{women between the ages}} of 50 and 74. Several tools are available to help target breast cancer screening to older women with longer life expectancies. Similar imaging studies can be performed with magnetic resonance imaging but evidence is lacking.|$|E
40|$|Introduction - This study re - {{examined}} the epidemiology of bilateral <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> {{with regard to}} the age at diagnosis and histology of the first <b>breast</b> <b>cancer,</b> and {{examined the}} effect of bilateral <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> on <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> survival. Methods - A cohort of US women with <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>was</b> identified using <b>cancer</b> registry data for the period 1973 to 2000 obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. In this cohort, incidence cases of bilateral <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>were</b> identified and rates calculated per 1, 000 person - years and the effect on survival of a diagnosis of a bilateral <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>was</b> determined using time - dependent proportional hazard regression. Results - The overall incidence of bilateral <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>was</b> 5. 5 per 1, 000 person - years and, apart from an elevation in incidence in the first year, was constant over time. In age - cohorts of young women, age - specific rates of bilateral <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>were</b> found to decline as these women aged, approaching the incidence observed in older age cohorts. In older age - cohorts, age - specific rates were comparatively constant until age 75 - 79 years, after which age - specific rates began to decline regardless of age at first diagnosis. Differences in the crude incidence of bilateral <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> in sub - cohorts of women with lobular carcinoma (6. 56 per 1, 000 person - years) and infiltrating ductal carcinoma (5. 31 per 1, 000 person - years) were largely explained by differential incidence in the first year following diagnosis of the first <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> Diagnosis of bilateral <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> increased the risk of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> mortality, independent of the interval {{between the first and second}} <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> Stage of both the first and second <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> <b>was</b> found to be the most important determinant of risk. Conclusions - This study found that the pattern of age - specific incidence of bilateral <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>was</b> consistent with effects already well established in the literature describing the incidence of first primary <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> - pre - menopausal effects in young women and underascertainment in older women. Estimates of the incidence of bilateral <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>were</b> subject to bias caused by an elevation in the incidence in the first year following diagnosis of the first <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> This <b>was</b> most likely an effect of increased surveillance. This explained to a large extent, associations between the histology of the first <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> and the incidence of bilateral <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> observed in earlier studies. This study challenged the currently accepted view that bilateral <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>was</b> a sign of increased susceptibility to <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> Instead it <b>is</b> argued that the constant annual incidence of bilateral <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> suggests a final, discrete stage in a multistage carcinogenesis process. It is further argued that the observed incidence of bilateral <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> allows us to estimate the incidence of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> in the population among women reaching this final stage within their lifetime. It is conservatively estimated that by age 75 to 79 years only half the women in the population have reached this final stage. This implies that in half the population of women, <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> either never initiates or progresses so slowly that the final stage of carcinogenesis is not reached within their lifetime.

25|$|A {{contemporary}} woman's life-time {{probability of}} developing <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> approximately one in seven; {{yet there is}} no causal evidence that fat grafting to the breast might be more conducive to breast cancer than are other breast procedures; because incidences of fat tissue necrosis and calcification occur in every such procedure: breast biopsy, implantation, radiation therapy, breast reduction, breast reconstruction, and liposuction of the breast. Nonetheless, detecting <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> primary, and calcification incidence is secondary; thus, the patient is counselled to learn self-palpation of the breast and to undergo periodic mammographic examinations. Although the mammogram is the superior diagnostic technique for distinguishing among cancerous and benign lesions to the breast, any questionable lesion can be visualized ultrasonically and magnetically (MRI); biopsy follows any clinically suspicious lesion or indeterminate abnormality appeared in a radiograph.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Northeastern Iran {{is known}} as a high risk area of upper {{gastrointestinal}} cancers. Recent reports have suggested a declining trend for these cancers as well as an increase in the incidence of other malignancies including <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> Our present aim was to describe the epidemiological pattern of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> in this region during 2004 - 2009. Methods: All new cancer cases from public and private diagnostic and therapeutic centers of Golestan province were registered. A structured questionnaire was prepared and used based on the oncology was considered for coding. Age standardized incidence rates (ASR) of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>were</b> calculated. Results: A total of 11, 038 new <b>cancer</b> cases <b>were</b> registered during 2004 - 2009, of which, 1, 101 (10) <b>were</b> females with <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> The median age of the <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> patients <b>was</b> 46 years.

The ASR of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>was</b> significantly lower in females from Turkmen ethnicity and those from rural areas (P value < 0. 01). Conclusion: Our study showed high rate of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> in Golestan province of Iran. We found an unusual peak of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> in young women. So, the age of starting screening programs may need to be revised in this area. The rate of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>was</b> significantly lower in women from Turkmen ethnicity.
