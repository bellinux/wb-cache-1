40|$|With an {{approach}} of the velocity of flight of a ship to the velocity of sound, there occurs a considerable increase of the drag. The reason for this must {{be found in the}} boundary layer separation caused by formation of shock waves. It will be endeavored to reduce the drag increase <b>by</b> <b>suction</b> of the boundary layer. Experimental results showed that drag increase may be considerably reduced by this method. It was, also, observed that, <b>by</b> <b>suction,</b> the position of shock waves can be altered to a considerable extent...|$|R

5000|$|In {{advanced}} airway management {{foreign objects}} are either removed <b>by</b> <b>suction</b> or with e.g. a Magill forceps under {{inspection of the}} airway with a laryngoscope or bronchoscope. If removal is not possible surgical methods should be considered.|$|R
25|$|Nasogastric {{aspiration}} {{involves the}} placement of a tube via the nose down into the stomach, the stomach contents are then removed <b>by</b> <b>suction.</b> This procedure is mainly used for liquid ingestions where activated charcoal is ineffective, e.g. ethylene glycol poisoning.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bodfish said nothing; it is {{doubtful}} whether he even heard these remarks; but he drew a huge notebook from his pocket, and after vainly trying to point his pencil <b>by</b> <b>suction,</b> took a knife {{from the table and}} hastily sharpened it.|$|R
30|$|Data were {{obtained}} retrospectively after {{review of the}} automated and computerized anesthesia records and medical charts. The primary outcome was the volume of blood loss during the procedures. This was defined by the volume of blood loss determined <b>by</b> <b>suctioning</b> and gauze absorption during surgery.|$|R
50|$|Petechiae on {{the soft}} palate are mainly {{associated}} with streptococcal pharyngitis, and as such it is an uncommon but highly specific finding. 10 to 30 percent of palatal petechiae cases {{are estimated to be}} caused <b>by</b> <b>suction,</b> which can be habitual or secondary to fellatio.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} in the Langley full-scale tunnel of a 47. 5 degree sweptback wing-fuselage combination equipped for boundary-layer control <b>by</b> <b>suction.</b> The wing aspect ratio was 3. 5, the taper ratio was 0. 5 and the airfoil sections normal to the quarter-chord line were NACA 61 (sub 1) -A 112. Tests included the plain wing and the wing with various combinations of extensible leading-edge and split flaps. The investigation was made to determine the effect of boundary-layer control <b>by</b> <b>suction</b> on the aerodynamic characteristics in yaw and on the effectiveness of a split-flap-type aileron for a range of angle of attack and suction-flow coefficient at a Reynolds number of 4. 2 x 10 (exp 6) corresponding to a Mach number of approximately 0. 07...|$|R
50|$|Cleanup of spent agent can be difficult, as {{it forms}} a residue when discharged. If the spent agent is dry it can be removed <b>by</b> <b>suction,</b> but when {{combined}} with water, hydrocarbons and other liquids, {{it forms a}} thick crusty scum that can be challenging to remove.|$|R
50|$|Catheter embolectomy is {{also used}} for {{aspiration}} embolectomy, where the thrombus is removed <b>by</b> <b>suction</b> rather than pushing with a balloon. It is a rapid and effective way of removing thrombi in thromboembolic occlusions of the limb arteries below the inguinal ligament, as in leg infarction.|$|R
50|$|Filterless {{cyclonic}} separation systems only require emptying {{the dirt}} collection container before the <b>suction</b> drops <b>off</b> as an almost-full condition is reached. Many cyclonic vacuum systems now feature translucent dirt collection canisters, allowing quick inspection without removing the canister.|$|R
40|$|A new {{radioimmunoassay}} {{technique is}} described in which a sampling manifold and polycarbonate filter membranes are used. Antigen-antibody reactions {{take place on the}} membranes. The manifold permits the simultaneous running of 30 samples and a rapid wash technique in which the washing solution is introduced into the manifold wells and <b>suctioned</b> <b>off</b> from below. The polycarbonate membrane offers a distinct advantage over the cellulose acetate in that nonspecific protein adsorption is substantially reduced. Antigens employed are whole bacteria or soluble antigen coupled to Sepharose beads and are layered over the membrane surface. A radiolabeled antibody is used to measure the primary antigen-antibody interaction. The sensitivity of the procedure is equal to that of fluorescent antibody tests...|$|R

50|$|Following damage by rain to the nest, S. cyanea will seal a leak {{of water}} with their mouth-pieces. Individuals begin <b>by</b> <b>suctioning</b> {{the water from the}} wall of the nest and then finish by {{expelling}} the water to the exterior of the colony. The hole is then repaired using wood pulp.|$|R
40|$|This {{literature}} review indicates that menstrual regulation during the fifth to seventh week of pregnancy {{is not always}} as free from risk as has sometimes been claimed. In particular, it has a higher failure rate, in terms of continued pregnancy, than has abortion <b>by</b> <b>suction</b> in later stages of pregnancy...|$|R
50|$|Definitive {{diagnosis}} is made <b>by</b> <b>suction</b> biopsy of the distally narrowed segment. A histologic {{examination of the}} tissue would show a lack of ganglionic nerve cells. Diagnostic techniques involve anorectal manometry, barium enema, and rectal biopsy.The suction rectal biopsy is considered the current international gold standard in the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease.|$|R
5000|$|A round {{manhole cover}} {{can be easily}} locked in place with a quarter turn (as is done in {{countries}} like France), which makes them hard to open without a special tool. Lockable covers {{do not have to}} be made as heavy, because traffic passing over them cannot lift them up <b>by</b> <b>suction.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{glass slide}} is wetted with acetone, {{and a fresh}} layer of acetate is placed upon it. The acetone allows the acetate to 'suck' itself onto the slide, {{maintaining}} a good contact <b>by</b> <b>suction.</b> This will later be dissolved, allowing sections of the resin-mounted peel to be cut for transmission electron microscopy.|$|R
6000|$|Ask {{a plumber}} who is {{repairing}} your pump, how {{the water is}} raised in it, and he replies--"By suction." [...] Recalling the ability which he has to suck up water into his mouth through a tube, he is certain that he understands the pump's action. To inquire what he means <b>by</b> <b>suction,</b> seems to him absurd. He says {{you know as well}} as he does, what he means; and he cannot see that there is any need for asking how it happens that the water rises in the tube when he strains his mouth in a particular way. To the question why the pump, acting <b>by</b> <b>suction,</b> will not make the water rise above 32 feet, and practically not so much, he can give no answer; but this does not shake his confidence in his explanation.|$|R
30|$|Our banding {{ligation}} method can {{be employed}} for both bleeding sessile or pedunculated gastric polyps. Sessile polyps are often difficult to be captured by traditional electrocautery polypectomy. Although endoscopic mucosal resection with cap-fitted panendoscopy may capture the lesions <b>by</b> <b>suction,</b> bleeding is a possible serious complication following the procedure (Inoue et al. 1993), especially in patients with bleeding tendency. In this situation, banding ligation of the lesions is possibly a good choice because {{it is easy to}} aspirate the polyps <b>by</b> <b>suction,</b> and the avoidance of resection procedure might decrease the risk of bleeding. In this reported case, 3  ml of distilled water was injected into the base of the bleeding polyp to lift the lesion off the muscle layer. Additionally, submucosal injection before banding ligation could compress the vessels in the submucosal layer and was possibly beneficial for preventing bleeding.|$|R
50|$|Axolotls {{have barely}} visible vestigial teeth, {{which would have}} {{developed}} during metamorphosis. The primary method of feeding is <b>by</b> <b>suction,</b> during which their rakers interlock to close the gill slits. External gills are used for respiration, although buccal pumping (gulping air from the surface) may {{also be used to}} provide oxygen to their lungs.|$|R
50|$|Adhesion is an {{alternative}} to claws, which works best on smooth surfaces. Wet adhesion is common in tree frogs and arboreal salamanders, and functions either <b>by</b> <b>suction</b> or <b>by</b> capillary adhesion. Dry adhesion is best typified by the specialized toes of geckos, which use van der Waals forces to adhere to many substrates, even glass.|$|R

50|$|However, {{the lack}} of wear on anomalocaridid {{mouthparts}} suggests they did not come into regular contact with mineralised trilobite shells, and computer modelling of anomalocaridid mouthparts suggests they were possibly better suited to feeding on smaller, soft-bodied organisms <b>by</b> <b>suction,</b> since they would have experienced structural failure if they were used against the armour of trilobites.|$|R
