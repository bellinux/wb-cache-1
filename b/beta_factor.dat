This study applied a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design and a consecutive sampling method of data collection. Immunohistochemical analysis of transforming growth <b>factor</b> <b>beta</b> 1 level was measured on the day 0 (pretest) and the day 4 (posttest). In this study, the modern dressing application improves transforming growth <b>factor</b> <b>beta</b> 1 level.

As estimated by its mRNA expression in fresh tissue samples, transforming growth <b>factor</b> <b>beta</b> {{was produced in}} normal and in diseased thyroid glands. Transforming growth <b>factor</b> <b>beta</b> mRNA was mainly produced by thyroid follicular cells and in lesser quantities by thyroid infiltrating mononuclear cells. The concentrations of transforming growth <b>factor</b> <b>beta</b> mRNA were lower in iodine-deficient nontoxic goiter than in Graves' disease and normal thyroid tissue. Transforming growth <b>factor</b> <b>beta</b> protein secretion by cultured thyroid follicular cells was also low in nontoxic goiter, but could be increased by addition of sodium iodide (10 microM) to the culture medium. Recombinant transforming growth <b>factor</b> <b>beta</b> did not affect basal tritiated thymidine incorporation in cultured thyroid follicular cells, but inhibited, at a concentration of 10 ng/ml, the growth stimulatory influence of insulin-like growth factor I, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor alpha, TSH, and partly that of normal human serum on cultured thyroid follicular cells. This inhibition was greater in Graves' disease than in nontoxic goiter. These results suggest that transforming growth <b>factor</b> <b>beta</b> may act as an autocrine growth inhibitor on thyroid follicular cells.

50|$|During rifting, as {{the crust}} is thinned, the Earth's surface {{subsides}} and the Moho becomes correspondingly raised. At the same time, the mantle lithosphere becomes thinned, causing {{a rise of}} the top of the asthenosphere. Once rifting ceases, the mantle beneath the rift cools and this is accompanied by a broad area of post-rift subsidence. The amount of subsidence {{is directly related to the}} amount of thinning during the rifting phase calculated as the <b>beta</b> <b>factor</b> (initial crustal thickness divided by final crustal thickness), but is also affected by the degree to which the rift basin is filled at each stage, due to the greater density of sediments in contrast to water. The simple 'McKenzie model' of rifting, which considers the rifting stage to be instantaneous, provides a good first order estimate of the amount of crustal thinning from observations of the amount of post-rift subsidence. This has generally been replaced by the 'flexural cantilever model', which takes into account the geometry of the rift faults and the flexural isostasy of the upper part of the crust.|$|E

From the investigation, four core aspects of the definition for the common cause failure are extracted, and improved classifications for root causes and coupling factors of the common cause failure are suggested.

From the investigation of the framework, the relationship among definition of the common cause failure, causes of the common cause failure, common cause failure parametric model, parameter estimation and system model is provided.
