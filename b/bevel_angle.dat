40|$|Abstract — Many medical {{procedures}} involve {{the use of}} needles, but targeting accuracy can be limited due to obstacles in the needle’s path, shifts in target position caused by tissue deformation, and undesired bending of the needle after insertion. In order to address these limitations, we have developed robotic systems that actively steer a needle in soft tissue. A bevel (asymmetric) tip causes the needle to bend during insertion, and steering is enhanced when the needle is very flexible. An experimental needle steering robot was designed that includes force/torque sensing, horizontal needle insertion, stereo image data acquisition, and controlled actuation of needle rotation and translation. Experiments were performed with a phantom tissue {{to determine the effects}} of insertion velocity and <b>bevel</b> tip <b>angle</b> on the needle path, as well as the forces acting on the needle during insertion. Results indicate that needle steering inside tissue does not depend on insertion velocity, but does depend on <b>bevel</b> tip <b>angle.</b> In addition, the forces acting on the needle are directly related to the insertion velocity.

5000|$|Double bevel or {{compound}} bevel — A back bevel, {{similar to}} a sabre or flat grind, is put on the blade behind the edge bevel (the bevel which is the foremost cutting surface). This back bevel keeps the section of blade behind the edge thinner which improves cutting ability. Being less acute at the edge than a single bevel, sharpness is sacrificed for resilience: such a grind is much less prone to chipping or rolling than a single bevel blade. This profile is commonly found in Japanese swords, such as the familiar katana. The shape of the bevel is much more efficient in reducing drag than the sabre grind typically found on Western sword blades. In practice, double bevels are common {{in a variety of}} edge <b>angles</b> and back <b>bevel</b> <b>angles,</b> and Western kitchen knives generally have a double bevel, with an edge angle of 14-16° (included angle of 28-32°) and a maximum of 40° as specified by International standard ISO 8442.1 (knives for the preparation of food).|$|R

The four (4) input parameters (plate thickness, cutting speed, arc ampere, and torch standoff distance) of the ANN was selected following the results (relative importance) of the Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) performed based on seven (7) factors (plate thickness, cutting speed, arc ampere, arc voltage, air pressure, pierce height, and torch standoff distance) in a previous study. A multi-parameter optimization was carried out using the robust design. An L 18 (21 × 37) Taguchi orthogonal array experiment was conducted and the right <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> was measured, aiming at the investigation of the influence of plasma-arc cut process parameters on right side <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> of St 37 mild steel cut surface.

However, the {{limited amount of}} high-Re experimental data has hampered the development and validation of scaling laws and modelling techni-ques applicable to such flows. This paper presents measurements of the turbulent flow near {{the trailing edge of}} a two-dimensional lifting surface at chord-based Reynolds numbers, ReC, typical of heavy-lift aircraft wings and full-scale ship propellers. The experiments were conducted in the William B. Morgan Large Cavitation Channel at flow speeds from 0. 50 to 18. 3 m s− 1 with a cambered hydrofoil having a 3. 05 m span and a 2. 13 m chord that generated 60 metric tons of lift at the highest flow speed, ReC ≈ 50 × 106. Flow-field measurements concentrated on the foil’s near wake and include results from trailing edges having terminating <b>bevel</b> <b>angles</b> of 44 ◦ and 56 ◦. Although generic turbulent boundary layer and wake characteristics were found at any fixed ReC in the trailing-edge region, the variable strength of near-wake vortex shedding caused the flow-field fluctuations to be Reynolds-number and trailing-edge-geometry dependent. In the current experiments, vortex-shedding strength peaked at ReC = 4 × 106 with the 56 ◦ bevel-angle trailing edge. A dimensionless scaling for this phenomenon constructed from the free-stream speed, the wake thickness, and an average suction-side shear-layer vorticity at the trailing edge collapses the vortex-shedding strength measurements for 1. 4 × 106 ReC 50 × 106 from both trailing edges and from prior measurements on two-dimensional struts at ReC ∼ 2 × 106 with asymmetrical trailing edges. 1...|$|R

Apical seal improvement can be obtained by root end filling and decreasing the root end resection angle (<b>bevel</b> <b>angle).</b> The aim of this study was to investigate the role of <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> on apical microleakage following the use of amalgam and MTA as root end filling materials. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 128 extracted human teeth were instrumented and obturated by lateral condensation technique. The teeth were divided into two groups and the apical root resection was performed by high speed fissure bur (one group perpendicular to the long axis of the teeth and the other 45 &# 61616; to the long axis. The 3 mm root end cavity was prepared by ultrasonic device. Each group was divided into two subgroups: One filled with amalgam and the other with MTA. Teeth were incubated for 72 h, covered by two layers of nail polish (except for apical 3 mm) and submerged in methylene blue for 48 h. Teeth were washed under tap water and mesiodistally dissected by low speed disc. Dye penetration was evaluated by stereomicroscope. Data were analysed by two way ANOVA and Tukey tests with p< 0. 05 as the limit of significance. Results: The results showed that retrofill material type had a significant effect on microleakage and MTA was superior to amalgam in this respect. <b>Bevel</b> <b>angle</b> failed to show any significant effect on apical microleakage. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, it seems that the use of MTA instead of amalgam in clinical practice can improve the success rate of endodontic surgery whereas the <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> can be determined based on the status of each individual case; However, increasing the <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> seems to increase microleakage due to exposure of more dentinal tubules...|$|E

40|$|Flush {{repairs to}} {{military}} aircraft {{are expected to}} become more prevalent as more thick skin composites are used, particularly {{on the surface of}} the fuselage, wings and other external surfaces. The use of these repairs, whilst difficult to manufacture provide an aerodynamic, “stealthy” finish that is also more structurally efficient than overlap repairs. This research was undertaken to improve the design methodology of scarf repairs with reduced material removal and to investigate the damage tolerance of scarf repair to low velocity impact damage. Scarf repairs involve shallow <b>bevel</b> <b>angles</b> to ensure the shear stress in the adhesive does not exceed allowable strength. This is important when repairing structures that need to withstand hot and humid conditions, when the adhesive properties degrade. Therefore, considerable amounts of parent material must be machined away prior to repair. The tips of the repair patch and the parent laminate are very sharp, thus a scarf repair is susceptible to accidental damage. The original contributions include: •	Developed analytic means of predicting the stresses within optimised scarf joints with dissimilar materials. New equations were developed and solved using numerical algorithms. •	Verified using finite element modelling that a scarfed insert with dissimilar modulus subjected to uniaxial loading attracted the same amount of load as an insert without a scarf. As such, the simple analytic formula used to predict load attraction/diversion through a plate with an insert may be used to predict the load attraction/diversion into a scarf repair that contains a dissimilar adherend patch. •	Developed a more efficient flush joint with a doubler insert placed near the mid line of the parent structure material. This joint configuration has a lower load eccentricity than external doubler joint. •	Investigated the damage tolerance of scarf joints, with and without the external doubler. The results showed that scarf joints without external doublers exhibited a considerable strength reduction following low velocity impact. Based on the observations, the major damage mechanics in the scarf joint region following impact have been identified. These results demonstrated that it is important to incorporate damage tolerance in the design of scarf repairs...|$|R

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of microwave and millimetre-wave systems, the performance requirements for passive band-pass filters and diplexers, as essential parts in these systems, are steadily increasing. Both rectangular waveguide and substrate-integrated waveguide technologies help to satisfy various high-performance requirements. Rectangular waveguides offer {{the advantages of}} low loss and high power handling capabilities, while substrate-integrated waveguides have the advantages of low cost and easy integration into planar circuit technology. Besides, the miniaturisation of electronic devices is of great importance, especially for microwave or millimetre-wave systems whose volume is limited by system considerations. Hence, the two main aims of this thesis are firstly to develop efficient methods which can improve the design reliability and reduce the design cycle of such passive devices, and secondly to present novel structures of band-pass filters and diplexers whose dimensions are reduced. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, a method based on the mode-matching technique is developed to rigorously and efficiently analyse the negative influence introduced by micromachining errors on the performance of band-pass H-plane iris filter. This analysis includes the effect on the centre frequency and 3 dB bandwidth caused by the round angles between waveguide walls and H-plane irises, or by the <b>bevel</b> <b>angles</b> on the H-plane irises. To remove these undesired influences, three approaches are proposed and verified with simulations performed with the finite-element method. In the next part, efficient approximation approaches are investigated in the framework of the mode-matching method to analyse the characteristics of cylindrical posts placed in the cross-section of a rectangular waveguide or substrate-integrated waveguide. Compared with the H-plane irises in rectangular waveguides, cylindrical posts are more promising for realising band-pass rectangular waveguide filters, because the geometries are easier to manufacture and less prone to machining errors. Thus, a general design procedure for band-pass post filters in rectangular waveguides and substrate-integrated waveguides is developed and verified with finite-element simulations and measurements on prototypes. The tolerance analysis for the band-pass filters is also explored quickly and accurately with the developed method, while the influence of realistic material losses on the insertion loss of various structures, is also quantitatively analysed with a full-wave simulation solver. Next, the characteristics of a shielded microstrip line for single-mode operation is investigated rigorously based on the mode-matching method. The research focuses on the influence of the metal enclosure dimensions on the fundamental mode, and the relationships between the cutoff frequency of the 2 nd-order mode and the geometrical variables of the cross-section of the shielded transmission line. A similar method is then applied to an E-type folded substrate-integrated waveguide. The analysis demonstrates that the propagation characteristics for the first twenty modes in the E-type folded substrate-integrated waveguide and its corresponding equivalent rectangular waveguide are almost identical if the width of the middle metal vane in the E-type folded substrate-integrated waveguide is chosen reasonably. Exploiting this similarity property, a novel concept of band-pass post filter in E-type folded substrate-integrated waveguide technology is developed to reduce the band-pass filter dimension further, together with an efficient specific design procedure. The validity of the approach is verified via finite-element simulations and measurements on a fabricated prototype. Finally, to reduce the sizes of common diplexers, four types of novel three-port junctions are proposed, including two improved Y-junctions in substrate-integrated waveguide technology, a double-layer junction in substrate-integrated waveguide technology, a Y-junction in T-type folded substrate-integrated waveguide technology, and a junction with stairs in T-type and E-type folded substrate-integrated waveguide technology. Exploiting the flexibility of the in-house developed mode-matching code or a commercial finite-element simulation solver, the characteristics for all presented junctions are shown to satisfy the constraints for optimum performance of diplexers when adjusting the relevant variables in the corresponding structures. Three types of these junctions are then utilised in realising diplexers whose performance is verified over the required operation bands with either numerical simulations or measurements on fabricated prototypes. In summary, this thesis has introduced novel concepts and realisations of compact band-pass filters and diplexers in unfolded or folded substrate-integrated waveguide technology, as well as related structures. One of the crucial aspects emphasised throughout the research is the need for efficient and accurate modelling methods specifically tailored to support such developments. This has been demonstrated throughout the thesis with the combined use of powerful numerical methods and equivalent models based on symmetries or unfolded geometries. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis {{has been carried out}} in the following two areas of Optical metrology: 1. Measurement and correction of prism angles 2. Measurement of refractive indices using a spectrograph. The prism angles are conventionally tested by mechanical <b>bevel</b> protractors, autocol-limators (<b>angle</b> dekkors), simple interference techniques and interferometers. All these methods have their own limitations either in accuracy or in terms of cost. Mechanical methods are usually employed to measure the angles of prisms. Interference techniques and interferometers are also used but they need optically polished components. For both mechanical and simple interference methods of testing, it is essential to fabricate more than a single component in number. The process of building interferometers or purchasing interferometers, angle dekkors and standard angle gauges is not cost effective for many research laboratories, and medium scale industries. To overcome these difficulties simple and inexpensive methods without sacrificing the accuracy in the bargain are suggested for the measurement of prism angles, based on the principles of reflection of light. The refractive indices of prism materials for invisible and weaker spectral lines are usually determined from spectrograms using dispersion formulae and numerical interpolation techniques. In these methods, the accuracy of the results depends on the accuracy of determining the constants of the dispersion formulae. A simple experimental technique, using a spectrograph, is devised for the measurement of refractive indices of solids and liquids both for visible and invisible spectral lines (wavelengths). The thesis has been divided into six chapters. The first chapter starts with the general introduction.

The influence of 45 ° <b>bevel</b> <b>angle,</b> stacking sequence and failure modes were analyzed, to examine the brittle failure mechanisms related to crash energy absorption during compression of the flat plate specimens. Results indicate that energy absorption is highly influenced by the trigger <b>bevel</b> <b>angle,</b> load rate and stacking sequence. The peak load decreased {{with an increase in}} load rate and the failure modes varied with the stacking sequence...|$|E
