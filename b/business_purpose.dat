500|$|The {{source of}} Hsu's income once he {{returned}} to the United States is unclear. While he claims to be involved in several businesses in the fashion industry, visits to those addresses [...] "found no trace of Mr. Hsu." [...] At several business addresses provided on Hsu's campaign donation forms, none of the listed businesses could be located. A New Jersey fashion designer that Hsu had listed as a co-investor, said he had never heard of Hsu. Lawrence Barcella, Hsu's Washington, D.C. attorney, claims that Hsu's post-1996-return Silicon Valley investments account for some of his ability to make his political contributions. However, detailed financial records for Components Ltd, a Hsu-controlled entity with no obvious <b>business</b> <b>purpose,</b> reveal payments of $100,000 to nine political donors whose contributions were later bundled by Hsu.|$|E

NBC responded by creating an initial run of 4,000bobblehead dolls, which sold out almost immediately.

2500|$|Common law {{tests were}} often {{important}} for determining who was, {{not just an}} employee, but the relevant employers who had [...] "vicarious liability". Potentially there can be multiple, joint-employers could who share responsibility, although responsibility in tort law can exist regardless of an employment relationship. In Ruiz v Shell Oil Co, the Fifth Circuit held that it was relevant which employer had more control, whose work was being performed, whether there were agreements in place, who provided tools, {{had a right to}} discharge the employee, or had the obligation to pay. In Local 217, Hotel & Restaurant Employees Union v MHM Inc the question arose under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 whether a subsidiary or parent corporation was responsible to notify employees that the hotel would close. The Second Circuit held the subsidiary was the employer, although the trial court had found the parent responsible while noting the subsidiary would be the employer under the NLRA. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 USC §203(r), any [...] "enterprise" [...] that is under common control will count as the employing entity. Other statutes do not explicitly adopt this approach, although the NLRB has found an enterprise to be an employer if it has [...] "substantially identical management, <b>business</b> <b>purpose,</b> operation, equipment, customers and supervision." [...] In South Prairie Construction Co v Local No 627, the Supreme Court found that the DC Circuit had legitimately identified two corporations as a single employer given that they had a [...] "very substantial qualitative degree of centralized control of labor", but that further determination of the relevant bargaining unit should have been remitted to the NLRB. When employees are hired through an agency, {{it is likely that the}} end-employer will be considered responsible for statutory rights in most cases, although the agency may be regarded as a joint employer.|$|E
6000|$|The cool weather of {{the morning}} {{following}} Mr. Dumphy's momentous interview with Colonel Starbottle, contributed somewhat to restore the former gentleman's tranquillity, which had been considerably disturbed. He had, moreover, a vague recollection of having invited Colonel Starbottle to visit him socially, and a nervous dread of meeting this man, whose audacity was equal to his own, {{in the company of}} others. Braced, however, by the tonic of the clear exhilarating air, and sustained by the presence of his clerks and the respectful homage of his business associates, he despatched a note to Arthur Poinsett requesting an interview. Punctually at the hour named that gentleman presented himself, and was languidly surprised when Mr. Dumphy called his clerk and gave positive orders that their interview was not to be disturbed and to refuse admittance to all other visitors. And then Mr. Dumphy, in a peremptory, practical statement which his business habits and temperament had brought to a perfection that Arthur could not help admiring, presented the details of his interview with Colonel Starbottle.

Many courts have ruled favorably for the corporations while others have ruled against. This requirement is correlated with the non-device requirement by stating the stronger the <b>business</b> <b>purpose</b> of the corporation is, the less evidence of device in the purpose of the transaction.
