5|$|The British {{government}} requested for the United States to send {{vessels to}} assist those {{affected by the}} storm. A number of residents of Belize City were left without food and water supplies. The USS Swan (AM-34), stationed at nearby Trujillo, Honduras, was dispatched to send aid to <b>British</b> <b>Honduras.</b> United States President Herbert Hoover ordered the United States Navy and American Red Cross to cooperate in relief efforts. Both agencies and organizations ordered a United States Marine Corps plane from Managua, Nicaragua, to send $2,500worth of medical supplies to affected areas of <b>British</b> <b>Honduras.</b> Throughout the city, relief kitchens were set up. The Government of <b>British</b> <b>Honduras</b> eventually began burning areas with debris and bodies, to prevent spread of disease. Monrad Metzgen, a lieutenant of the <b>British</b> <b>Honduras</b> Defense Force, became responsible for the rescue of persons trapped, feeding those without shelter, and the burial of the deceased. For his efforts, Metzgen received an Order of the British Empire award from King George V of the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Authorities of Belize City {{considered}} {{abandoning the}} community and moving it to higher ground. Additionally, there was a proposal to relocate the capital further south or inland to the pine ridge, with either resulting in a higher elevation of the capital. However, the process of moving the capital did not begin until 1961, after Belize City was devastated by Hurricane Hattie. Belmopan became {{the capital city of}} <b>British</b> <b>Honduras</b> in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Making {{landfall}} {{near the}} border between Mexico and <b>British</b> <b>Honduras,</b> the latter colony's Corozal and Orange Walk districts, containing a population of 15,500at the time, experienced severe devastation from Janet. Strong hurricane winds knocked down and damaged numerous trees across <b>British</b> <b>Honduras,</b> particularly in the Freshwater Creek Forest Preserve. There, an estimated 30%of all trees had been damaged, especially mahogany and sapodilla trees. Hurricane Janet also caused extensive damage to crops, with an estimated $2.631million in damages. Fruit trees, maize, and sugar cane crops suffered the most damage. Sugar cane was {{expected to have a}} 20%decrease in yield due to the damage sustained after the storm. Pineapple crops and livestock experienced less significant losses. To a lesser extent, the hurricane also affected the Belize District and several of British Honduras' offshore cayes. Similar to Corozal and Orange Walk Districts, corn, trees, and coconut experienced the most severe damage of any crop.|$|E
50|$|Thomas Gann {{retired as}} <b>British</b> <b>Honduras's</b> medical officer in 1923 {{when he wrote}} several books about his travels and explorations. He sold {{a large number of}} objects he had {{collected}} in the Mayan region to the British Museum in 1924.|$|R
50|$|The {{intensification}} of denominational rivalry, the benign {{neglect of the}} colonial state, and the growing influence of United States Jesuit missionaries in education characterized the second phase which lasted from 1893 to 1934. In 1934 the director of education in Jamaica made a thorough investigation of <b>British</b> <b>Honduras's</b> education system. Various reforms were proposed to increase spending on the school system and improve the standard of education. Implementation {{of many of these}} reforms began in the late 1930s.|$|R

5|$|Relief and {{reconstruction}} measures were enacted in the <b>British</b> <b>Honduras</b> beginning on September30. A large-scale reconstruction program was {{initiated by the}} government to help rebuild 48villages. The government also {{declared a state of emergency}} for Corozal, Orange Walk, and Belize administrative districts, including a ban on liquor sales. Temporary communication lines were rebuilt, which initially only allowed official communications with affected areas. Due to the severity of the damage in Corozal, an airstrip was built to help deliver relief to the city more efficiently. Food depots in Corozal, Louisville, and Orange Walk Town were tasked with distributing food. The potential for widespread disease following the devastation wrought by Janet forced a widespread vaccination initiative against typhoid fever in affected areas. The Jamaican government sent £20,000 (US$55,000) to the colony in relief funds, while the British government sent £40,000 (US$110,000) to affected areas in the <b>British</b> <b>Honduras</b> and other affected islands in the Caribbean. The United States sent the cargo ship USS Antares, which supplied the colony with various relief materials. In Corozal Town, a $3.5million grant was given to land surveyor H.C. Fairweather to plan and reconstruct the township.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlers}} {{were discovered}} in early May 1823 by the Mexican Eagle, a schooner from <b>British</b> <b>Honduras</b> carrying the Chief Magistrate of Belize, Marshal Bennet, to the Mosquito king's court. Seven men and three children had died, and many more were sick. Bennet informed them that Poyais did not exist {{and that he had}} never heard of this Cazique they spoke of. He advised them to return with him to <b>British</b> <b>Honduras,</b> as they would surely die if they stayed where they were. The majority preferred to wait for Hall to come back, hopefully with news of passage back to Britain. About half a week later Hall returned with the Mosquito king, who announced that MacGregor's land grant was revoked forthwith. He had never granted MacGregor the title of Cazique, he said, nor given him the right to sell land or raise loans against it; the emigrants were in fact in George Frederic Augustus's territory illegally and would have to leave unless they pledged allegiance to him. All the settlers left except for about 40 who were too weakened by disease to make the journey.|$|E
5|$|By Hattie's {{one year}} anniversary, {{private and public}} workers {{repaired}} and rebuilt buildings affected by the storm. New hotels were constructed, and many stores were reopened. Prime Minister George Cadle Price successfully appealed for assistance from the British government, which ultimately provided £20millionin loans. In {{the days after the}} storm, the government announced plans to relocate the capital of <b>British</b> <b>Honduras</b> farther inland on higher ground. Work on the new capital, Belmopan, was completed in 1970. On the 44th anniversary of the hurricane in 2005, the government of Belize unveiled a monument in Belize City to recognize the victims of the hurricane.|$|E
5000|$|The African Progress Union (APU) {{was founded}} in London in 1918 as [...] "an Association of Africans from various parts of Africa, the West Indies, <b>British</b> Guiana, <b>Honduras</b> and America, {{representing}} advanced African ideas in liberal education". The first president was John Archer. He was succeeded in 1921 by John Alcindor. Others involved as founders included John Eldred Taylor and Dusé Mohamed Ali.|$|R
50|$|The {{greatest}} {{achievements of}} the agitation of the 1930s were the labour reforms passed between 1941 and 1943. Trade unions were legalised in 1941, but the laws did not require employers to recognise these unions. Furthermore, the penal clauses of the old Masters and Servants Act rendered the new rights ineffectual. Employers among the unofficial members at the Legislative Council defeated a bill to repeal these penal clauses in August 1941, but the Employers and Workers Bill, passed on 27 April 1943, finally removed breach-of-labour-contract from the criminal code and enabled <b>British</b> <b>Honduras's</b> infant trade unions to pursue the struggle for improving labour conditions. The General Workers' Union (GWU), registered in 1943, quickly expanded into a nationwide organisation and provided crucial support for the nationalist movement that took off {{with the formation of}} the People's United Party (PUP) in 1950. The 1930s were therefore the crucible of modern Belizean politics. It was a decade during which the old phenomena of exploitative labour conditions and authoritarian colonial and industrial relations began to give way to new labour and political processes and institutions.|$|R

5|$|On August 25, Tropical Storm Chloe made {{landfall}} on <b>British</b> <b>Honduras</b> (present day Belize) as {{a tropical}} depression. After dissipating, {{the remnants of}} the storm crossed into the Pacific Ocean, where they contributed to an area of shower activity that persisted over the Gulf of Tehuantepec. On August 28, the tropical activity organized around a circulation which quickly developed into a tropical depression the same day. The depression was upgraded to a tropical storm on August 29 based on satellite presentation that depicted significant cirrus outflow and a commashaped cloud mass spanning 2° of latitude in diameter and was subsequently named Lily.|$|E
5|$|One month later, the House of Lords {{passed the}} Slavery Abolition Act, which {{abolished}} slavery {{in most of}} the British Empire from August 1834. They voted plantation owners £20million in compensation, giving full emancipation to children younger than six, and instituting a system of apprenticeship requiring other enslaved peoples to work for their former masters for four to six years in the British West Indies, South Africa, Mauritius, <b>British</b> <b>Honduras</b> and Canada. Nearly 800,000 African slaves were freed, the vast majority in the Caribbean.|$|E

5|$|When Laura's {{path was}} uncertain, forecasters advised {{fishermen}} {{to remain at}} port along the Yucatan Peninsula and southern Florida. Gale warnings were also issued for the Florida Keys, due to the uncertainty. No significant damage or casualties were reported in Central America, although heavy rainfall was reported across the region. On Glover's Reef {{off the coast of}} <b>British</b> <b>Honduras</b> (now Belize), the storm stranded a group of about 20scientists affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution; the group was affected by the strong winds and rains, and required rescue. The storm damaged several buildings along the mainland.|$|E
5|$|Hattie {{maintained}} {{much of its}} intensity as {{it continued}} toward the coast of <b>British</b> <b>Honduras.</b> After moving through several small islands offshore, the hurricane made landfall a short distance south of Belize City on October 31, with an eyewall of about 25 miles (40 km) in diameter. Based on a post-season analysis, {{it was determined that}} Hattie had weakened to winds of 140 mph (225 km/h) before moving ashore. The hurricane deteriorated rapidly over land, dissipating on November 1 as it moved into the mountains of Guatemala. During its dissipation, Tropical Storm Simone was developing off the Pacific coast of Guatemala. There was speculation that Hattie contributed to the development of Simone, and later Tropical Storm Inga after the remnants of Simone merged with nearby disturbed weather.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Francelia brought {{significant}} flooding to Central America, especially Belize and Guatemala. The sixth named {{storm and}} fourth hurricane of the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season, Francelia developed from a tropical wave {{in the southeastern}} Caribbean Sea on August29. It moved west-northwestward and strengthened into a tropical storm on the following day. On September1, Francelia reached hurricane status, shortly before re-curving west-southwest. While approaching Central America, the storm intensified and peaked as a 115mph (185km/h) Category3 hurricane on September2. Francelia weakened slightly before making landfall near Punta Gorda, Belize (then <b>British</b> <b>Honduras)</b> late on September3. The storm quickly weakened inland and dissipated by the following day.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Hattie first posed {{a threat}} to the Yucatán Peninsula and <b>British</b> <b>Honduras</b> on October30 when it turned toward the area. Officials at the Miami Weather Bureau warned of the {{potential}} for high tides, strong winds, and torrential rainfall. The warnings allowed for extensive evacuations in high-risk areas. Most people in the capital, Belize City, were evacuated or moved to shelters, and a school was operated as a refuge. A hospital in the city was evacuated, and over 75% of the population of Stann Creek fled to safer locations. After Hattie made landfall, officials in Mexico ordered the closure of ports along the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Hattie moved ashore in <b>British</b> <b>Honduras</b> with a storm tide {{of up to}} 14feet (4.3m) near Belize City, a city of 31,000people {{located at}} sea-level; its only {{defenses}} against the storm tide were a small seawall and a strip of swamp lands. The capital experienced high waves and a 10ft (3m) storm tide along its waterfront that reached the third story of some buildings. A trained observer estimated winds of over 150mph (240km/h), and winds in the territory were unofficially estimated as strong as 200mph (325km/h). When Hattie affected the area, most buildings in Belize City were wooden, and most of this type were destroyed. Offshore, the hurricane heavily damaged 80% of the Belize Barrier Reef, although the reef recovered after the storm.|$|E
5|$|Late on July 14, Abby had re-intensified into a hurricane. A {{few hours}} later, Abby {{passed over the}} island of Roatán at about midnight (EDT) on July 15. It made a third and final {{landfall}} on July 15 when it moved inland over <b>British</b> <b>Honduras</b> (presently known as Belize) as a minimal hurricane. Abby quickly weakened and was downgraded to a tropical storm {{only a few hours}} later over land. While Abby approached the border of Guatemala and Mexico, it had weakened further to a tropical depression. Abby dissipated while situated over the Mexican state of Tabasco on July 16. The remnants crossed over Mexico into the Pacific Ocean and regenerated into Hurricane Celeste on July 20. Hurricane Celeste lasted for two days in the Pacific before it dissipated on July 22.|$|E
50|$|For a {{brief period}} in the 1850s, Britain {{declared}} the Bay Islands its colony. Within a decade, the Crown ceded the territory formally back to <b>Honduras.</b> <b>British</b> colonists were sent to compete for control.

50|$|The Government of Honduras {{was heavily}} embroiled with {{troubles}} on the mainland, {{and had little}} interest in her newly won possessions some 10 to 50 mi off her northern shore. Honduras took no action at all until April 12, 1861, when her Minister of Foreign Affairs sent a brief note to a Mr. Hall, then <b>British</b> Consul to <b>Honduras.</b> This note informed Hall that Honduras was not yet prepared to take possession of the Bay Islands, and requested that England remain patient.|$|R
5|$|The most {{significant}} tropical cyclone of the season, {{known as the}} Matagorda hurricane, developed on August23. After striking the Yucatán Peninsula, the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico and intensified into a Category3 hurricane on Saffir–Simpson scale, becoming the only major hurricane of the season. The hurricane devastated southern Texas, with damage as far inland as San Antonio. Eight fatalities and about $26.5million in damage were reported. Several of the proceeding tropical systems left little impact on land, though {{the remnants of the}} ninth tropical storm contributed to severe flooding in Virginia. In November, a hurricane caused extensive impact in several coastal communities of Belize (then known as <b>British</b> <b>Honduras).</b> The hurricane left nine deaths and about $4million in damage.|$|E
5|$|About 200British {{soldiers}} {{arrived from}} Jamaica to quell looting and maintain order. At least 20people {{were arrested in}} the day after Hattie struck. The British government sent flights of aid to the territory containing food, clothing, and medical supplies. The House of Commons quickly passed a bill to provide £10,000in aid. The Save the Children fund sent £1,000to <b>British</b> <b>Honduras,</b> and the Mexican government sent three flights with food and medicine to the territory. Two American destroyers arrived in the country by November2, reporting the need for assistance. The USS Antietam remained at port for weeks after the storm with six medical officers and six Marine helicopters. Four other ships sailed to the territory to provide 458,000lb (208,000kg) of food. The United States government allocated about $300,000in assistance through the International Development Association. The Canadian government provided C$75,000worth of aid, including food, blankets, and medical supplies.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Abby was {{the only}} {{tropical}} cyclone in the Caribbean Sea during the 1960 Atlantic hurricane season. The second tropical cyclone and first named storm of the season, Abby developed on July 10 from a tropical wave {{in the vicinity of}} the Lesser Antilles. Abby rapidly intensified into a hurricane after being a tropical storm for less than six hours. It briefly peaked as a category 2 hurricane before weakening back. Abby rapidly weakened to a minimal tropical storm a few days thereafter. The storm re-strengthened into a hurricane as it began to parallel the coast of Honduras. Hurricane Abby made landfall in <b>British</b> <b>Honduras</b> (present-day Belize) on July 15. Abby dissipated over Mexico later the next day. The remnants of Abby ultimately became Hurricane Celeste in the Pacific Ocean. Despite passing through or near several countries, Hurricane Abby had a relatively light impact on land, resulting in just $640,500 (1960 USD, $ USD) in damage and six fatalities.|$|E
50|$|HMS Merlin {{was one of}} the two {{original}} Merlin-class sloops {{that served}} the Royal Navy during the French Revolutionary Wars. She was launched in 1796 and was broken up in 1803. Her greatest accomplishment was her role as the leading vessel in a motley flotilla of local vessels that defeated a Spanish attack on the <b>British</b> colonists in <b>Honduras</b> at the Battle of St. Georges Caye. She later captured a number of small merchant vessels in the West Indies before returning to Britain, where she was broken up.|$|R
25|$|During Lindo's {{presidency}} (1847–52), the <b>British</b> began pressuring <b>Honduras</b> for {{the payment}} of debts and other claims. In 1849 a British naval force briefly occupied the port of Trujillo, destroying property and extorting 1,200 pesos from the local government. The following year, Lindo's own vice president revolted and was prevented from seizing power only through the military intervention of El Salvador and Nicaragua. All this turmoil may help to explain why Lindo refused an additional presidential term and instead turned over power in 1852 to the opposition liberals, headed by Trinidad Cabañas (1852–55). Three years later, the conservative government of Guatemala invaded Honduras and ousted Cabañas, installing in his place the conservative leader, Jose Santos Guardiola.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} for the Spanish rulers of Honduras, was {{the activity of the}} <b>British</b> in northern <b>Honduras,</b> a region over which they had only tenuous control. These activities began in the sixteenth century and continued until the nineteenth century. In the early years, European pirates frequently attacked the villages on the Honduran Caribbean. The Providence Island Company, which occupied Providence Island not far from the coast, raided it occasionally and probably also had some settlements on the shore, possible around Cape Gracias a Dios. Around 1638, the king of the Miskito visited England and made an alliance with the English crown. [...] In 1643 an English expedition destroyed the city of Trujillo, Honduras's main port.|$|R
