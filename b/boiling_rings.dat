40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of meal accompaniments on the acceptability and sensory attribute liking for a mayonnaise enriched with walnut oil, in the presence and absence of a health claim. Through focus group interviews we chose the foods to accompany the mayonnaise and the terminology to provide the health claim to subjects during the subsequent consumer test. During {{the first phase of}} the consumer test, the subjects responded to some questions about their food habits and evaluated three samples of mayonnaise with different contents of walnut oil without any information. During the second phase, the subjects were divided into two homogeneous groups and evaluated the samples associated to three different foods. The informed group tasted the samples accompanied by the health claim, the control group without any information. When the meal accompaniments were hamburger or French fries, acceptability of mayonnaise increased, whereas <b>boiled</b> squid <b>rings</b> had a negative effect on acceptability. The health claim did not affect the average consumer respons...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to study the kinetic reaction models for catalytic hydrogenation of aromatic content for Basrah crude oil (BCO) and vacuum gas oil (VGO) derived from Kirkuk crude oil which has the <b>boiling</b> point <b>rang</b> of (611 - 833) K.             This work is performed using a hydrodesulphurization (HDS) pilot plant unit located in AL-Basil Company. A commercial (HDS) catalyst cobalt-molybdenum (Co-Mo) supported in alumina (γ-Al 2 O 3) is used in this work. The feed is supplied by North Refinery Company in Baiji. The reaction temperatures range is (600 - 675) K over liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) range of (0. 7 - 2) hr - 1 and hydrogen pressure is 3 MPa with H 2 /oil ratio of 300 of Basrah Crude oil (BCO), while the corresponding conditions for vacuum gas oil (VGO) are (583 - 643) K, (1. 5 - 3. 75) hr - 1, 3. 5 MPa and 250  respectively.             The results showed that the reaction kinetics is of second order for both types of feed. Activation energies are found to be 30. 396, 38. 479 kJ/mole for Basrah Crude Oil (BCO) and Vacuum Gas Oil (VGO) respectively. </p...|$|R
40|$|An {{associative}} ring is {{just realized}} or built using reals or complex; finite or infinite by defining two binary operations on it. But {{on the contrary}} when we want to define or study or even introduce a non-associative ring we need two separate algebraic structures say a commutative ring with 1 (or a field) together with a loop or a groupoid or a vector space or a linear algebra. The two non-associative well-known algebras viz. Lie algebras and Jordan algebras are mainly built using a vector space over a field satisfying special identities called the Jacobi identity and Jordan identity respectively. Study of these algebras started as early as 1940 s. Hence the study of non-associative algebras or even non-associative <b>rings</b> <b>boils</b> down {{to the study of}} properties of vector spaces or linear algebras over fields...|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{toppings}} include marinerede sild, {{which are}} pickled herrings (plain, krydret - spiced, or karry - curried), slightly sweeter than Dutch or German herrings; thinly sliced cheese in many varieties; sliced cucumber, tomato and boiled eggs; leverpostej, which is pork liver-paste; dozens {{of types of}} cured or processed meat in thin slices, or smoked fish such as salmon; mackerel in tomato sauce; pickled cucumber; <b>boiled</b> egg, and <b>rings</b> of red onion. Mayonnaise mixed with peas, sliced boiled asparagus and diced carrot, called italiensk salat (lit. Italian salad, so named because the colours match the Italian flag), remoulade or other thick sauces often top the layered open sandwich, which is usually eaten with utensils. It is custom to pass the dish of sliced breads around the table, and then to pass around each dish of toppings, and people help themselves.|$|R
60|$|Now when I had {{mastered}} {{the language of}} this water and {{had come to know}} every trifling feature that bordered the great river as familiarly as I knew the letters of the alphabet, I had made a valuable acquisition. But I had lost something, too. I had lost something which could never be restored to me while I lived. All the grace, the beauty, the poetry had gone out of the majestic river! I still keep in mind a certain wonderful sunset which I witnessed when steamboating was new to me. A broad expanse of the river was turned to blood; in the middle distance the red hue brightened into gold, through which a solitary log came floating, black and conspicuous; in one place a long, slanting mark lay sparkling upon the water; in another the surface was broken by <b>boiling,</b> tumbling <b>rings,</b> that were as many-tinted as an opal; where the ruddy flush was faintest, was a smooth spot that was covered with graceful circles and radiating lines, ever so delicately traced; the shore on our left was densely wooded, and the somber shadow that fell from this forest was broken in one place by a long, ruffled trail that shone like silver; and high above the forest wall a clean-stemmed dead tree waved a single leafy bough that glowed like a flame in the unobstructed splendor that was flowing from the sun. There were graceful curves, reflected images, woody heights, soft distances; and over the whole scene, far and near, the dissolving lights drifted steadily, enriching it, every passing moment, with new marvels of coloring.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Principal Ideal Problem (resp. Short Principal Ideal Problem), shorten as PIP (resp. SPIP), {{consists}} {{in finding a}} generator (resp. short generator) of a principal ideal in the ring of integers of a number field. Several lattice-based cryptosystems rely on the presumed hardness of these two problems. In practice, {{most of them do}} not use an arbitrary number field but a power-of-two cyclotomic field. The Smart and Vercauteren fully homomorphic encryption scheme and the multilinear map of Garg, Gentry, and Halevi epitomize this common restriction. Recently, Cramer, Ducas, Peikert, and Regev showed that solving the SPIP in such cyclotomic <b>rings</b> <b>boiled</b> down to solving the PIP. In this paper, we present a heuristic algorithm that solves the PIP in prime-power cyclotomic fields in subexponential time L(1 / 2), where ∆ K denotes the discriminant of the number field. This is achieved by descending to its totally real subfield. The implementation of our algorithm allows to recover in practice the secret key of the Smart and Vercauteren scheme, for the smallest proposed parameters (in dimension 256) ...|$|R
