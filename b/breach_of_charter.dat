25|$|The {{inclusion}} of a charter of rights in the Constitution Act was a much-debated issue. Trudeau spoke on television in October 1980, and announced his intention to constitutionalize {{a bill of rights}} that would include fundamental freedoms, democratic guarantees, freedom of movement, legal rights, equality and language rights. He did not want a notwithstanding clause. While his proposal gained popular support, provincial leaders opposed the potential limits on their powers. The federal Progressive Conservative opposition feared liberal bias among judges, should courts be called upon to enforce rights. Additionally, the British Parliament cited their right to uphold Canada's old form of government. At a suggestion of the Conservatives, Trudeau's government thus agreed to a committee of Senators and MPs to further examine the bill of rights as well as the patriation plan. During this time, 90 hours were spent on the bill of rights alone, all filmed for television, while civil rights experts and advocacy groups put forward their perceptions on the Charter's flaws and omissions and how to remedy them. As Canada had a parliamentary system of government, and as judges were perceived not to have enforced rights well in the past, it was questioned whether the courts should be named as the enforcers of the Charter, as Trudeau wanted. Conservatives argued that elected politicians should be trusted instead. It was eventually decided that the responsibility should go to the courts. At the urging of civil libertarians, judges could even now exclude evidence in trials if acquired in <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>Charter</b> rights in certain circumstances, something the Charter was not originally going to provide for. As the process continued, more features were added to the Charter, including equality rights for people with disabilities, more sex equality guarantees and recognition of Canada's multiculturalism. The limitations clause was also reworded to focus less on the importance of parliamentary government and more on justifiability of limits in free societies; the latter logic was more in line with rights developments around the world after World War II.|$|E
60|$|Remarkable indeed was the {{behaviour}} of {{the young}} priest. At his entrance on board the ship, he fell on {{his face in the}} most humble prostration to the Almighty. I thought, indeed, he had fallen into a swoon, and so ran to help him up; but he modestly told me, he was returning his thanks to the Almighty, desiring me to leave him a few moments, and that, next to his Creator, he would return me thanks also. And indeed he did so about three minutes after, with great seriousness, and affection, while the tears stood in his eyes, which convinced me of the gratitude of his soul. Nor did he less show his piety and wisdom in applying himself to his country people, and labouring to compose them, by the most powerful reasons, arguments, and persuasions. And when, indeed, these people had taken their night's repose, in such lodgings as our ship would allow, we found nothing but the best of manners, and the most civil acknowledgements, for which the French are eminently remarkable. The next day the Captain and one of the priests desired to speak with me and my nephew the commander. They told us, that they had saved some money and valuable things out of the ruined vessel, which was at our service; only that they desired to be set on shore some where in our way. At the first my nephew was for accepting the money; but I (who knew how hard my case would have been, had the Portuguese Captain served me so) persuaded him to the contrary; and therefore told them, that as we had done nothing but what we were obliged to do, by nature and humanity, and what we ourselves might expect from others in such calamity; so we took them up to save them, not to plunder them, or leave them naked upon the land, to perish for want of subsistance, and therefore would not accept their money: but as to landing them, that was a great difficulty; for being bound to the East Indies, it was impossible wilfully to change our voyage upon their particular account, nor could my nephew (who was under charter party to pursue it by was of Brazil) answer it to the freighters. All that we could do, was to put ourselves in the way of meeting some ships homeward bound from the West Indies, that, if possible, they might get a passage to France or England. Indeed, they were very thankful for our first kindness; but were under great concern, especially the passengers, at their being carried to the East Indies. They begged therefore, I would keep on the banks of Newfoundland, where, probably, they might meet with some ship, or sloop to carry them to Canada, whence they came. As this was but a reasonable request, I was inclined to grant it, since it was no <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>charter</b> party, and that the laws of God and nature obliged us to do what good we could to our fellow-creatures; and besides the danger we ourselves should be in for want of provisions: so we consented to carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and weather would permit; if not, that we should carry them to Martinico in the West Indies. But, as it happened, in a week's time we made the banks of Newfoundland, where the French people hired a bark to carry them to France. But the young priest being desirous to go to the East Indies, I readily agreed to it, because I liked his conversation, and two or three of the French sailors also entered themselves on board our ship.|$|E

40|$|Three recent {{judgments}} of the Supreme Court of Canada signal {{a departure from}} the broad and generous manner in which the Court has previously interpreted and applied section 24 (1) of the Charter. In each of R. v. Bjelland, Canada (Prime Minister) v. Khadr and R. v. Nasogaluak, the Supreme Court agreed with the trial judge’s finding of a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>Charter</b> rights but overturned the trial judge’s choice of remedy under section 24 (1) in order to grant a more limited remedy in its place. In doing so, the Court shifted the analytical focus away from the promotion of remedial efficacy and toward the minimization of the burdens imposed by the remedy on government. This article reviews each of these judgments and examines {{the extent to which they}} are consistent with previous section 24 (1) jurisprudence and the purpose of the Charter’s broadest remedial provision...|$|E
40|$|The issue {{addressed}} in this paper is whether we have effective remedies for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>Charter</b> protected rights and freedoms, as well as clear jurisdictional guidelines for granting such remedies. The relationship between the judiciary and the other branches of government provides the context for exploring the jurisprudence on remedies and jurisdiction. The cases that establish the foundational principles regarding the interpretation of section 24 (1) and section 52 (1), {{and the relationship between}} these provisions, are examined. The guidelines for granting section 52 (1) remedies and for identifying the decision makers that have jurisdiction to do so are explored, as are the guidelines and jurisdiction for granting remedies under section 24 (1). The the sis of this paper is that while there have been substantial developments in this area, we do not yet have a cohesive set of principles that will ensure that a person whose Charter rights have been infringed will be granted a just and appropriate remedy in an expeditious manner. There are gaps in the law, particularly for statutory courts and administrative tribunals that have the duty to abide by and apply the Constitution, but not the authority to grant a remedy that will do justice to a claimant. The courts cannot provide a complete solution since the legislatures have exclusive authority to assign the jurisdiction of the courts and tribunals. However, the courts can point out the problem and urge the legislatures to take up the issue in a manner that respects the division of powers among the branches of government...|$|E

Under the supremacy clause of section 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982, an administrative tribunal that has the power (express or implied) to decide questions of law can also decide on the constitutionality of laws, including even the constitutionality of provisions of its own enabling statute. Under the remedial clause of section 24 of the Constitution Act, 1982, an administrative tribunal that is deemed to be a “court of competent jurisdiction” (and most tribunals are) can award a declaration, injunction, costs, or other appropriate and just remedy, for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Charter</b> <b>of</b> Rights.

50|$|The Scottish Court's {{workload}} {{was small}} until the mid-eighteenth century, with judges hearing {{no more than}} four matters in each sitting. After the 1750s the volume of cases rose until by 1790 it was necessary to maintain a daily log of decisions. The growth in caseload was related to increasing disputes regarding <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>charter,</b> including ship's masters seeking compensation for unpaid freight and merchants suing for damage to goods or unexpected port fees. Cases reflected Scotland's principal marine industries including the transshipment of sugar and tobacco and the export of dried fish, coal and grains. A smaller number of cases related to smuggling, principally brandy, and to salvage rights for ships wrecked on Scottish shores. The Court ceased operation in 1832 and its functions were subsumed into the Court of Session, Scotland's supreme court for civil disputes.|$|R

On June 9, 2014, Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin stated the constitutional question in this case as follows: [...] "Does s. 24(1) <b>of</b> the Canadian <b>Charter</b> <b>of</b> Rights and Freedoms authorize a {{court of competent jurisdiction}} to award damages against the Crown for prosecutorial misconduct absent proof of malice?" ...|$|R
