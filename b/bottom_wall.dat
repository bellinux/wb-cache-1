500|$|Within Adventure, the Easter egg {{is located}} inside the black castle catacombs (on {{difficulty}} level 2 or 3), {{embedded in the}} south wall of a sealed chamber (accessible only with the bridge), where there is an invisible 1-pixel object {{referred to as the}} Gray Dot. The player must bounce the avatar along the <b>bottom</b> <b>wall</b> to pick up the dot. The dot is not actually invisible, but is simply the same color as the wall and is easily seen when placed in a catacombs passage or over a normal wall. The dot is not attracted to the magnet, unlike most other objects in Adventure. Bringing this dot to the east end of the corridor below the Yellow Castle while other differently colored objects are present causes the wall object to similarly become effectively invisible, allowing the player to pass into a room displaying the words [...] "Created by Warren Robinett".|$|E
500|$|On {{the right}} side, the first chapel was {{dedicated}} to the Virgin Mary. On its vault were paintings of four Doctors of the Church (Ambrose, Jerome, Augustine and Gregory the Great), and its walls were adorned with frescoes by Cristoforo Ambrogini (or Ambrogi). Several frescoes, depicting events in the Life of the Virgin attributed to a late-mannerist Emilian artist, are {{on display at the}} Museo di Roma. The second chapel {{was dedicated to}} San Biagio, and housed a panel painting of the saint. This, the last chapel added to the church, was the original side door on the Borgo Vecchio. The third chapel was dedicated to the Nativity of Jesus. It was called [...] "of the circumcision" [...] because of a painting by Giovanni Battista Ricci (nicknamed [...] "ilNovara" [...] after his birthplace) of the Circumcision of Jesus. It was also known as the [...] "chapel of the stone", since the stone over which Jesus had reportedly been presented at the temple in Jerusalem was kept here; after the church's demolition, the stone and that of the sacrifice of Isaac were moved to the nearby church of Santi Michele e Magno. Above its altar was an oil painting by a student of Ricci of the presentation of Jesus.

40|$|AbstractThe {{receptivity}} of plane Poiseuille flow {{to local}} single-period micro-vibration disturbances with different phases {{at the top}} and <b>bottom</b> <b>walls</b> was investigated through direct numerical simulation of three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Results show that the disturbance presents a symmetrical distribution in the spanwise direction when the micro-vibration on the wall ends, and the initial disturbance velocities and spatial distribution of the disturbance structure are different {{at the top and}} <b>bottom</b> <b>walls.</b> The disturbance's velocity, amplitude, and high- and low-speed streaks increase with time, and the amplitude of streamwise disturbance velocity is larger than those of spanwise and vertical disturbance velocities. However, no significant Tollmien-Schlichting wave was found in the flow field. The number of disturbance vortex cores gradually increases with the disturbance area. High-speed disturbance fluid concentrates near the wall and its normal velocity largely points to the wall, while low-speed disturbance fluid largely deviates from the wall. Furthermore, the streamwise velocity profiles near the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>walls</b> both become plump because of the existence of the disturbances, and the streamwise velocity profiles show a trend of evolving into turbulent velocity profiles. The shear stress near the wall increases significantly. The local micro-vibration disturbance on the wall in plane Poiseuille flow can induce the development of a structure similar to turbulent spots...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- As one of {{the most}} {{promising}} propulsive systems in the future, the scramjet engine has drawn the attention of many researchers. The two-dimensional coupled implicit NS equations, the standard k-ε turbulence model and the finite-rate/eddy-dissipation reaction model have been applied to numerically simulate the flow field of the hydrogen fueled scramjet combustor with a planer strut flame holder under two different working conditions, namely, cold flow and engine ignition. The obtained results show that the numerical method used in this paper is suitable to simulate the flow field of the scramjet combustor. The static pressure distribution along the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>walls</b> for the case under the condition of engine ignition is much higher than that for the case under the condition of cold flow. There are three clear pressure rises on the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>walls</b> of the scramjet combustor. The eddy generated in the strut acts as a flame holder in the combustor, and it can prolong the residence time of the mixture in the supersonic flow.

For a jet-to-mainstream mass flow ratio (MR) of 2. 0, design parameters were systematically varied for jet-to-mainstream momentum-flux ratios (J) between 16 and 64 and orifice spacing-to-duct height ratios (S/H) between 0. 125 and 1. 5. Comparisons were made between geometries optimized for S/H at a specified J. Inline configurations had a unique spacing for best mixing at a specified J. In contrast, staggered configurations had two 'good mixing' spacings for each J, one corresponding to optimum inline spacing and the other corresponding to optimum nonimpinging jet spacing. Increasing J resulted in better mixing characteristics if each configuration was optimized with respect to orifice spacing. Mixing performance was shown to be similar to results from previous dilution jet mixing investigations (MR less than 0. 5) ...|$|R
