5|$|Columbus also traded {{former first}} round draft pick Nikita Filatov to the Ottawa Senators for a third-round {{pick in the}} 2011 Draft. Filatov had {{failed to live up}} to {{expectations}} in Columbus, playing in only 44 games over three seasons scoring six goals. Prior to the start of the season, the Blue Jackets were questioned for not signing a veteran <b>back-up</b> to starting goaltender Steve Mason, as the former Calder Memorial Trophy winner had struggled in consecutive seasons. The Blue Jackets signed Mark Dekanich as the <b>back-up</b> who had only 50 minutes of NHL experience prior to the start of the season. Columbus did sign a veteran Curtis Sanford to be their third string goaltender and to start for their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Springfield Falcons. Sanford had not played in the NHL since 2009. During training camp, Dekanich suffered a high ankle sprain that was expected to keep him out of the line-up for a month. Additionally, Sanford suffered a groin injury, leaving Allen York as the <b>back-up.</b> York had only played four professional games, all in the AHL, entering the season.|$|E

The scene is intercut with sequences of Aguilera dancing in a crop top, which she later removes to reveal a bra, and a microskirt. Redman then proceeds down a hallway, passing people such as mud wrestlers, a contortionist, and furries. The video proceeds to a scene of Aguilera and <b>back-up</b> dancers splashing and dancing while being sprayed with water in a room containing several urinals, as a possible reference to urolagnia. It features several sexual fetishes, from mud wrestling to muscle worshipping.|$|E

50|$|Over the years, traffic <b>back-ups</b> at the Atlantic Boulevard flyover ramp escalated, {{as it was}} {{the only}} direct route to the base. These <b>back-ups</b> often took hours to clear, and with the rapid growth in the area, {{combined}} with the need for another hurricane evacuation route, a new road was a necessity. The base needed a more-direct route from the corridor since it was easy for new people to the area to get lost on previous directions from exits on I-295, such as SR 10 (Atlantic Boulevard) and Monument Road.|$|R
5|$|Communication plans {{should be}} made {{beforehand}} to inform of mitigation actions being undertaken.

Protective equipment such as eye protection and dust masks should be deployed for clean-up teams in advance of ash fall events.|$|E
5|$|Coordination {{of rescue}} efforts August 29 and August 30 were made {{difficult}} by {{disruption of the}} communications infrastructure. Many telephones, including most cell phones, and Internet access were inoperable because of line breaks, destruction of base stations, or power failures, even though some base stations had their own <b>back-up</b> generators. In a number of cases, reporters were asked to brief public officials on the conditions in areas where information was not reaching them any other way.|$|E
