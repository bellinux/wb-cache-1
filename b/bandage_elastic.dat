40|$|International audienceCompression {{bandages}} {{are commonly}} used {{in the treatment of}} some venous or lymphatic pathologies. The success of the treatment relies on the applied pressure, which depends on several parameters related to the bandage but also to patients’ morphology.

However, these two parameters are the only one taken into account in Laplace’s Law, actual reference method to explain interface pressure distribution...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCompression {{therapy has}} precise {{technical}} characteristics but in vivo pressures exerted by bandages are still poorly understood. ObjectiveTo perform in vivo pressure measurements of different compression bandages bearing different technical characteristics with different application methods. MethodInterface pressure was measured {{on the lower}} limb of 20 healthy women at 3 different points (B 1, C and F) using 6 compression techniques (stockings, non-elastic <b>bandage,</b> <b>elastic</b> bandages with 2 technical characteristics and 3 application methods), and in 3 positions. ResultsAll elastic compression bandages respected the principle of graduated pressure {{along the length of}} the limb (P< 0. 0001), but not the non-elastic bandage. The pressures increase significantly (P< 0. 0001) between the supine position and the sitting or standing position, especially with the non-elastic compression bandage. There is a marked variation in pressures between subjects for some bandages (non-elastic and elastic applied using the figure-of-eight technique). The pressure increases significantly with the number of bandage overlaps (P< 0. 01). ConclusionElastic and non-elastic bandages behave differently from one another, and non-elastic bandages not appearing to comply with medical recommendations concerning graduated pressure. There is a high level of variability between subjects for some compression bandages (non-elastic and figure-of-eight methods) ...|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the risk}} of latex allergies among users, the {{original}} composition of <b>elastic</b> <b>bandages</b> has changed. While some bandages are still manufactured with latex, many woven and knitted <b>elastic</b> <b>bandages</b> provide adequate compression without the use of natural rubber or latex. The modern <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> is constructed from cotton, polyester and latex-free elastic yarns. By varying the ratio of cotton, polyester, and the elastic yarns within a bandage, manufacturers are able to offer various grades of compression and durability in their wraps.

Some <b>elastic</b> <b>bandages</b> even use Velcro closures to secure and stabilize the wrap in place.|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} methods of <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> application in nursing practice. The theoretical part {{deals with the}} anatomy or venous and lymphatic system. It also focuses on examinations of venous and lymphatic system in which <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> application {{is an integral part}} of the procedure. The thesis refers to roles of a nurse in <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> application and to roles of bandage in nursing practice. Three objectives were set for the thesis. The first objective was to identify methods used by nurses in <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> application. The second objective was to find out what information about <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> application is available to the nurses. The third objective was to propose input documents for development of a manual for practical application of <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage.</b> All the objectives set for the thesis have been met. The thesis establishes four hypotheses. The hypothesis No. 1 ``Nurses prefer ear-shaped turns in application of elastic bandage`` has been confirmed. The hypothesis No. 2 ``Nurses are able to explain the difference between short-stretch and long-stretch bandages`` has not been confirmed. The hypothesis No. 3 ``Nurses understand the potential complications from incorrect application of elastic bandage`` has been confirmed. The survey used a questionnaire containing 26 questions. The questionnaire contained closed, half-closed and open questions. The data were collected in March 2009 in the hospital in České Budějovice. 110 questionnaires were distributed in total and 98 questionnaires were returned. 5 questionnaires were eliminated due to incompleteness. The total number of evaluated questionnaires was 93, which means the success rate 89. 1 %.

5000|$|An <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> is a [...] "stretchable bandage used {{to create}} {{localized}} pressure". <b>Elastic</b> <b>bandages</b> are commonly used to treat muscle sprains and strains by reducing {{the flow of blood}} to a particular area by the application of even stable pressure which can restrict swelling at the place of injury. <b>Elastic</b> <b>bandages</b> are also used to treat bone fractures.

Methods: Interventional research was using consecutive  sampling. Subjects were randomized into two groups: RRD and <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage.</b> Twenty-three subjects were analyzed. Stump  edema volume was measured by the amount of water spilled out from volume glass. <b>Elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> was reapplied every 4 hours  and RRD was refitted every 7 days during evaluation time. Stump edema volume was evaluated every 7 days during the 8 week observation. Results: There was a significant decrease of stump volume in RRD group during the first and second week (p = 0. 03, p = 0. 01) and the edema decreasing time was also significant (p = 0. 03).   The average decrease of edema volume in RRD was 63. 85 % of second week and in the <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> group was 34. 35 %. There were a tendency of pain reduction time in RRD group (4. 83 ± 1. 95 weeks) compared to <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> group (5. 18 ± 2. 31 weeks).

40|$|Our aim {{with this}} {{systematic}} review {{was to assess}} the effectiveness of various functional treatments for acute ruptures of the lateral ankle ligament in adults. We performed an electronic database search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, COCHRANE CONTROLLED TRIAL REGISTER and CURRENT CONTENTS. We evaluated randomized clinical trials describing skeletally mature subjects with an acute rupture of the lateral ankle ligament and compared functional treatments for inclusion in this study. 9 trials met our inclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of these trials and extracted relevant data on treatment outcome. Where appropriate, results of comparable studies were pooled. Individual and pooled statistics are reported as relative risks (RR) for dichotomous outcome and (weighted) mean differences ((W) MD) for continuous outcome measures with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). Heterogeneity between the trials was tested using a standard chi-square test. Persistent swelling at short-term follow-up was less with lace-up ankle support than with semi-rigid ankle support (RR 4. 2 95 % CI 1. 3 - 14), an <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> (RR 5. 5; 95 % CI 1. 7 - 18) and tape (RR 4. 1; 95 % CI 1. 2 - 14).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Acute lateral ankle {{ligament}} ruptures {{are common}} problems in present health care. Early mobilisation and functional treatment are advocated as a preferable treatment strategy. However, functional treatment comprises {{a broad spectrum}} of treatment strategies and as of yet no optimal strategy has been identified. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review is to assess different functional treatment strategies for acute lateral ankle ligament ruptures in adults. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group specialised register (December 2001), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2001), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2000), EMBASE (1980 to May 2000), CURRENT CONTENTS (1993 to 1999), BIOSIS (to 1999), reference lists of articles, and contacted organisations and researchers in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised clinical trials describing skeletally mature individuals with an acute lateral ankle ligament rupture and comparing different functional treatment strategies were evaluated for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of included trials and extracted relevant data on treatment outcome. Where appropriate, results of comparable studies were pooled. Individual and pooled statistics are reported as relative risks (RR) for dichotomous outcome and (weighted) mean differences (WMD) for continuous outcome measures with 95 per cent confidence intervals (95 %CI). Heterogeneity between trials was tested using a standard chi-squared test. MAIN RESULTS: Nine trials involving 892 participants were included. Lace-up ankle support had significantly better results for persistent swelling at short-term follow up when compared with semi-rigid ankle support (RR 4. 19, 95 % CI 1. 26 to 13. 98); <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> (RR 5. 48; 95 % CI 1. 69 to 17. 76); and to tape (RR 4. 07, 95 % CI 1. 21 to 13. 68). Use of a semi-rigid ankle support resulted in a significantly shorter time to return to work when compared with an <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> (WMD (days) 4. 24; 95 % CI 2. 42 to 6. 06); one trial found the use of a semi-rigid ankle support saw a significantly quicker return to sport compared with <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> (RR 9. 60; 95 % CI 6. 34 to 12. 86) and another trial found fewer patients reported instability at short-term follow-up when treated with a semi-rigid support than with an <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> (RR 8. 00; 95 % CI 1. 03 to 62. 07). Tape treatment resulted in significantly more complications, the majority being skin irritations, when compared with treatment with an <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> (RR 0. 11; 95 % CI 0. 01 to 0. 86). No other results showed statistically significant differences. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: The use of an <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> has fewer complications than taping but appears to be associated with a slower return to work and sport, and more reported instability than a semi-rigid ankle support. Lace-up ankle support appears to be effective in reducing swelling in the short-term compared with semi-rigid ankle support, <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> and tape. However, definitive conclusions are hampered by the variety of treatments used, and the inconsistency of reported follow-up times.

40|$|A {{total of}} 105 {{patients}} with fracture {{of the neck}} of the ring ~or little metacarpal bone were randomized to receive three different types of treatment: dorso-uluar plaster-of-Paris from the proximal interphalangeal joint to elbow; functional brace around the wrist; or <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage.</b> Twenty patients (19 %) had to be excluded for different reasons leaving 85 patients in the study. The remaining patients were examined after 4 weeks and 3 months. There was no difference in patient satisfaction between the three different types of treatment. The functional brace was in our opinion superior to the two other types of treatment: the patients had as little pain as the patients treated with plaster-of-Paris and less pain than patients treated with <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage.</b> Patients treated with a functional brace mobilized as fast as patients treated with <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> and faster than patients treated with plaster-of-Paris.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of hemorrhage {{in association with}} many forms of inflammation has suggested a study {{of changes in the}} vascular walls that favor the escape of red blood corpuscles. Inflammation of the cutis has been produced by a variety of means and the ability of the vessels to withstand mechanical injury produced by suction applied to the skin surface has been determined. Capillary bleeding can be produced by altering the relation between extraand intracapillary pressure. When venous flow is obstructed by application of an <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> to the arm intracapillary pressure is increased and petechiae occur. Rumpel (1) and Leede (2) discovered this phenomenon in patients with scarlet fever. Goetblin (3), Bayer (4), Bexelius (5), Walterhoefer (6) and others have developed methods of measuring capillary fragility based on this phenomenon. Goethlin, Shultzer (7) and others found a marked increase in capillary fragility in patients suffering from scurvy and a somewhat increased tendency to capillary bleeding in patients who had a history of vitamin C deficiency in their diet, as in patients fed on a diet of milk, cream and cereals used in the treatment of peptic ulcer. Walterhoefer found that the fall upon the forearm of a weight of 130 gin. from a height of 35 cm. increased the number of petechiae which occur when an <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> is applied to the arm. Bayer obtained an increased number of petechiae when he applied linen saturated with hot water for 5 minutes before application of the <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage.</b> He described increased capillary fragility in skin areas of slight erythema produced by ultraviolet light.

A retrospective file search was carried out in three different hospitals, analysing the time to first prosthesis, the incidence of local and general complications and the functional outcome after discharge from hospital. Each of the hospitals used a different method of postoperative care: <b>elastic</b> <b>bandaging,</b> immediate postoperative application of the plaster cast or delayed application of the plaster cast within one week post amputation. In comparison to the <b>elastic</b> <b>bandaging</b> method (N =  52), the use of a rigid dressing in the early fitting method (immediate and delayed, N =  97) resulted in a statistically significant shorter period from amputation to the delivery of a first regular prosthesis (110 days vs 50 days) and a decreased risk of knee flexion contracture. Although, differences in local complications were not observed, the risk of pressure sores in other places than the stump was increased in early fitting. Instead of further reducing the time to first prosthesis by immediate fitting, the use of delayed fitting resulted in a statistically significant shorter period from amputation to the delivery of a first regular prosthesis (56 vs 40 days). However, delayed fitting was associated with an increased risk for reamputation. In conclusion, this study indicates that early fitting by use of a rigid dressing after trans-tibial amputation is the treatment of choice.
