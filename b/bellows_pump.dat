40|$|Many medical {{techniques}} are {{not readily available}} in the third world, in the military, for disaster relief, and in domestic environments. This can {{be due to a}} lack of electricity, high cost, and other economical constraints. For these reasons, a successful, chronic wound treatment, known as negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), has not been readily used, although many patients would benefit. Aiming to expand this therapy, the viability of inexpensive, purely mechanical simplified negative pressure wound therapy (sNPWT) systems is explored in this thesis. Air leaks into the NPWT system are identified as the limiting factor for the possibility of sNPWT. An air leak detection system, along with proper dressing techniques, is defined. Once sNPWT is proven to be viable, it is developed further, based on customer needs in the targeted markets and sNPWT functional parameters. Three vacuum pump embodiments are prototyped and analyzed for possible implementation: bellows pumps, bladder pumps, and rolling diaphragm pumps. The <b>bellows</b> <b>pump</b> is chosen for the final design, and is analyzed in preparation for manufacture.

40|$|Abstract Background A self-contained, self-controlled, {{pneumatic}} power harvesting ankle-foot orthosis (PhAFO) to manage foot-drop {{was developed and}} tested. Foot-drop {{is due to a}} disruption of the motor control pathway and may occur in numerous pathologies such as stroke, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and cerebral palsy. The objectives for the prototype PhAFO are to provide toe clearance during swing, permit free ankle motion during stance, and harvest the needed power with an underfoot <b>bellow</b> <b>pump</b> pressurized during the stance phase of walking. Methods The PhAFO was constructed from a two-part (tibia and foot) carbon composite structure with an articulating ankle joint. Ankle motion control was accomplished through a cam-follower locking mechanism actuated via a pneumatic circuit connected to the <b>bellow</b> <b>pump</b> and embedded in the foam sole. Biomechanical performance of the prototype orthosis was assessed during multiple trials of treadmill walking of an able-bodied control subject (n = 1). Motion capture and pressure measurements were used to investigate the effect of the PhAFO on lower limb joint behavior and the capacity of the <b>bellow</b> <b>pump</b> to repeatedly generate the required pneumatic pressure for toe clearance. Results Toe clearance during swing was successfully achieved during all trials; average clearance 44 ± 5 mm. Free ankle motion was observed during stance and plantarflexion was blocked during swing. In addition, the bellow component repeatedly generated an average of 169 kPa per step of pressure during ten minutes of walking. Conclusion This study demonstrated that fluid power could be harvested with a pneumatic circuit built into an AFO, and used to operate an actuated cam-lock mechanism that controls ankle-foot motion at specific periods of the gait cycle. </p...|$|R

40|$|A resin-made-bellows pump is used {{practically}} as {{a chemical}} pump application. Its discharge pressure is low as 0. 1 MPa in general; therefore, its applicable fields are limited. In {{order to make}} the pressure higher, we developed a metal <b>bellows</b> <b>pump</b> driven by an electromagnetic reciprocating actuator for various industrial applications with the pressure of over 10 MPa and non-leakage performance.

However, the high-speed motion of the actuator by the armature position-and velocity-sensorless control makes issue that the armature collides hard with the stator and generates the noise and vibration.

40|$|We have {{conducted}} {{a series of}} experiments of superfluid helium, He II, cavitating flows. For the purpose of comparison, normal fluid, He I, flows were also examined. In the experiments liquid helium flows driven by a <b>bellows</b> <b>pump</b> were investigated by flow visualization method and PIV, and through the measurements of the temperature depression and the pressure loss. The most noticeable features characterizing superfluid cavitating flows arise from superthermal conduction, the specific heat anomaly and quantized vortices. Due to the superthermal conduction phenomena, latent heat can be supplied to cavitation bubbles from bulk liquid almost without limit, and consequently the development of cavitation is considerably rapid and in large-scale in He II. The specific heat becomes extremely large across the lambda phase transition line from He I to He II, which is known as the specific heat anomaly. In the present study, the experimental results obtained so far were examined with respect to the thermodynamic effect in He II cavitating flows referring to the Brennen thermodynamic parameter ?. It is seen that in most aspects the thermodynamic effect is negligible in cavitating flows of He II owing to the superthermal conduction. This means He II hardly behaves as a cryogenic fluid in cavitation phenomena. It is, on the other hand, found that the temperature depression is not negligible and there is apparent temperature dependence in its variation. Consequently, He II may, in some aspects, be expected to behave as a cryogenic fluid in cavitation because of extremely large void fraction...|$|E

We present a comprehensive study {{of the effects of}} electronegative impurity on gaseous and liquid argon scintillation light, an analysis of the efficacy of various purification chemicals, as well as the Liverpool LAr setup, which utilises a novel re-circulation purification system. Of the impurities tested-Air, O 2, H 2 O, N 2 and CO 2 in the range of between 0. 01 ppm to 1000 ppm- H 2 O was found to have the most profound effect on gaseous argon scintillation light, and N 2 was found to have the least. Additionally, a correlation between the slow component decay time and the total energy deposited with 0. 01 ppm- 100 ppm O 2 contamination levels in liquid argon has been established.

40|$|In {{the polar}} region, {{during the process}} of snow-firn-ice transition, the air in the snow is {{isolated}} from the atmosphere and enclosed in the ice as bubbles. The trapped air is expected to contain trace gases which represent the atmospheric concentrations at the time of ice formation. In order to study the change of the chemical state of the atmosphere and the climate in the past, we have initiated the analysis of trace gases in Antarctic deep ice core samples. An ice core sample was cut into several pieces after the removal of surface layer (1 cm) in the cold room at - 20 ℃ in NIPR. About 100 g of ice was placed in a greaseless glass flask which was sealed with a Viton O-ring and equipped with a glass-Teflon valve. The flask was first evacuated with the ice kept at dry ice temperature, then the valve was closed and the ice was thawed. After shaking the flask, the thawed water was refrozen quickly at liquid nitrogen temperature, leaving the dissolved air and trace gases (at equilibria at 0 ℃) trapped in the ice. The released air was dried by passing through a cold trap at - 100 ℃ and transferred into a preevacuated stainless steel sample loop or small flask by using an all-stainless steel <b>bellows</b> <b>pump.</b> The extracted gas was analyzed with a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector for methane and a mass spectrometer for other gases.

5000|$|Unlike {{the cooling}} fluid, oil cannot {{be allowed to}} boil. This {{presented}} a particular problem with DB 601-series engines, because oil is sprayed against {{the bottom of the}} pistons, resulting in a considerable amount of heat being transferred to the oil as opposed to the coolant. The He 100's oil cooling system was conceptually similar to the water cooling system in that vapor was generated using the heat of the oil and condensed back to liquid by surface cooling through the skins of the airframe. A heat exchanger was used to cool the oil by boiling ethyl alcohol. The oil itself was simply piped to and from this exchanger, which was apparently located in the aft fuselage. The alcohol vapor was piped into the fixed portions of the horizontal and vertical stabilizers and into a double-skinned portion of the upper-aft fuselage behind the cockpit. This fuselage [...] "turtle deck" [...] panel was the only double-skinned portion of the aircraft's cooling system. The use of a double-skinned panel was possible here because the inside of panel was accessible in the event of repair. Condensed alcohol was collected by a series of <b>bellows</b> <b>pumps</b> and returned to a single header tank that fed the heat exchanger. Some sources speculate that a small air intake located at the bottom front of the engine cowl was used for an auxiliary oil cooler. No such cooler was fitted, nor was there room for one at that point. This small inlet served simply to admit cool air into what was a very hot portion of the engine bay. Immediately above this vent were the two steam separators, and immediately behind it were the hot coolant pipes coming from the separators.|$|R

In the 4th century BC steel weapons like the Falcata were produced in the Iberian Peninsula, while Noric steel was used by the Roman military.

Much later, the American inventor William Kelly (1811–1888) brought four Chinese metallurgists to Eddyville, Kentucky in 1845, whose expertise in steelmaking influenced his ideas about air injection to reduce carbon content of iron; his invention anticipated the Bessemer process of English inventor Henry Bessemer (1813–1898).|$|R

500|$|Advances in {{military}} technology aided the Song dynasty in its defense against hostile {{neighbors to the}} north. The flamethrower found its origins in Byzantine-era Greece, employing Greek fire (a chemically complex, highly flammable petrol fluid) in a device with a siphon hose by the 7th century. The earliest reference to Greek Fire in China was made in 917, written by Wu Renchen in his Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms. In 919, the siphon projector-pump was used to spread the 'fierce fire oil' {{that could not be}} doused with water, as recorded by Lin Yu in his Wuyue Beishi, hence the first credible Chinese reference to the flamethrower employing the chemical solution of Greek fire (see also Pen Huo Qi). Lin Yu mentioned also that the 'fierce fire oil' derived ultimately from one of China's maritime contacts in the 'southern seas', Arabia (Dashiguo). In the Battle of Langshan Jiang in 919, the naval fleet of the Wenmu King from Wuyue defeated a Huainan army from the Wu state; Wenmu's success was facilitated by the use of 'fire oil' ('huo you') to burn their fleet, signifying the first Chinese use of gunpowder in a battle. The Chinese applied the use of double-piston <b>bellows</b> to <b>pump</b> petrol out of a single cylinder (with an upstroke and downstroke), lit at the end by a slow-burning gunpowder match to fire a continuous stream of flame.
