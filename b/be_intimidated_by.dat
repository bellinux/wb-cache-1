5|$|When Refn {{read the}} first {{screenplay}} for Drive, he was more intrigued by {{the concept of a}} man having a split personality, being a stuntman by day and a getaway driver at night, than the story itself. Believing that the director might <b>be</b> <b>intimidated</b> <b>by</b> the script as it was unlike anything he had done before, Gosling had concerns about Refn's desire to participate. Refn took on the project without hesitation.|$|E

After some initial successes, the unexpected surrender of the strategically important town of Grave was a serious blow to English morale. Leicester's fury turned on the town's governor, Baron Hemart, whom he had executed despite all pleadings.

During this month, the band was into the final weeks of production and had put the finishing touches on the tracks.|$|E
500|$|The anime {{adaptation}} of Gin Tama has received positive and mixed responses. The humor was noted {{to be improved}} after the series' introduction although some jokes were hard to understand because {{some of them are}} references to Japanese culture and other series. The notes on the DVD releases were criticized for lacking explanation of cultural jokes. Additionally, the humor's quality was found to be inconsistent within the first episodes due to the depth some bring, to the point that some viewers may abandon the series. The quality from the series was found to improve as the series continues as people would not <b>be</b> <b>intimidated</b> <b>by</b> its large number of episodes. The characters' action were praised due to their knowledge that their tendencies to [...] "break the fourth wall", while the female characters were found appealing based on their unusual qualities. The series has been noted for its ability to shift between comedy and drama without a loss of quality.|$|E
500|$|News of {{the armed}} {{uprising}} at Gonzales reached Santa Anna on October 23. [...] Aside from the ruling elite {{and members of the}} army, few in Mexico knew or cared about the revolt. [...] Those with knowledge of the events blamed the Anglos for their unwillingness to conform to the laws and culture of their new country. [...] Anglo immigrants had forced a war on Mexico, and Mexican honor insisted that the usurpers be defeated. [...] Santa Anna transferred his presidential duties to Miguel Barragán in order to personally lead troops {{to put an end to}} the Texian revolt. Santa Anna and his soldiers believed that the Texians would be quickly cowed. The Mexican Secretary of War, José María Tornel, wrote: [...] "The superiority of the Mexican soldier over the mountaineers of Kentucky and the hunters of Missouri is well known. Veterans seasoned by 20years of wars can't <b>be</b> <b>intimidated</b> <b>by</b> the presence of an army ignorant of the art of war, incapable of discipline, and renowned for insubordination." ...|$|E

500|$|Donkey Kong Jr. Math has {{received}} criticism for its qualities {{as an educational}} game. Elizabeth Sweedyk, associate computer science professor at Harvey Mudd College, called Donkey Kong Jr. Math a realistic educational video game, criticizing such games as [...] "not fun." [...] 1UP.coms Kevin Gifford called it a game that children {{would never want to}} play. Fellow 1UP.com writer Jeremy Parish commented that the game shouldn't be judged on being an educational game, citing quality educational titles as The Oregon Trail and Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?. However, he noted that it should be judged for being a boring game. Ars Technica's Frank Caron compared it to other educational games, calling it [...] "no Brain Age" [...] and preferring to play Math Blaster instead. Educational video game developer Traci Lawson wondered whether the word game Bookworm would have been as well received by players when they were children; she felt that they would <b>be</b> <b>intimidated</b> <b>by</b> it, comparing this to how she felt when she played Donkey Kong Jr. Math. In contrast to the negative reception, Allgame's Skyler Miller called it a creative use of Donkey Kong Jr.s graphics and gameplay.|$|E
500|$|After {{buying the}} rights to the film, Katzenberg quickly put it in active {{development}} in November 1995. Steven Spielberg had thought about making a traditionally animated film adaption of the book before, when he bought {{the rights to}} the book in 1991 before the founding of DreamWorks, where Bill Murray would play Shrek and Steve Martin would play Donkey. In the beginning of production, co-director Andrew Adamson refused to <b>be</b> <b>intimidated</b> <b>by</b> Katzenberg and had an argument with him how much should the film appeal to adults. Katzenberg wanted both audiences, but he deemed some of Adamson's ideas, such as adding sexual jokes and Guns N' Roses music to the soundtrack, to be too outrageous. Adamson and Kelly Asbury joined in 1997 to co-direct the film. However, Asbury left a year later for work on the 2002 film , and was replaced with story artist Vicky Jenson. Both Adamson and Jenson decided to work on the film in half, so the crew could at least know who to go to with specific detail questions about the film's sequences; [...] "We both ended up doing a lot of everything," [...] Adamson said. [...] "We're both kinda control freaks, and we both wanted to do everything." ...|$|E

2500|$|All {{of this is}} complicated, but is a {{consequence}} of the exceptionally wide-ranging nature of the rules, and the need to identify exactly what will happen under usually-obscure circumstances. To aid in this, a fair amount of the rules are actually dedicated to cross-referencing other rules sections. [...] As it is, the designers made an effort to ensure that there isn't any 'unaddressed interactions' between different rules, if there is a possible interaction, it is covered.
