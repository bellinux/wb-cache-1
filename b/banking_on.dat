5|$|Euskaltel-Euskadi has {{in their}} history been reticent to ride the Giro d'Italia, favoring the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España instead. After first {{indicating}} a reluctant willingness to participate as per the requirements of holding a ProTeam license, the team later stated that they intended to seek overall victory in the race with Antón. Antón was named {{as the leader of}} the squad, which included Nieve, Oroz, Isasi, Aramendía, Azanza, Cazaux, Sesma and Minguez to ride in support. Antón tempered the expectations somewhat, saying that a stage win would be nice, as would General Classification success should it come, but that he was only <b>banking</b> <b>on</b> riding for the overall at the Vuelta a España.|$|E

25|$|The land {{over which}} {{railways}} pass may have many owners—private, rail operator, or governmental—and, {{depending on the}} terms under which it was originally acquired, the type of operating rights may also vary.

The owner could reuse them for any purpose, or modify the ground conditions, potentially prejudicing the line's future reuse if required.

25|$|Texas Motor Speedway was {{originally}} designed with a dual-banking layout. The steep 24° <b>banking</b> <b>on</b> top would accommodate NASCAR races. A secondary 8° banking below {{was designed for}} the faster open-wheel machines. While the track was under construction, CART had expressed interest in holding a race at the facility. But after closer examination of the unusual dual-banking system, decided it was not feasible. The secondary banking design was ultimately deemed a failure, and in 1998, the turns were reconfigured. The dual banking was removed {{in favor of a}} larger apron, and after unrelated difficulties during the NASCAR events, the turn transitions were corrected.|$|E

25|$|Under {{leadership}} of José María Valiente and with consent of Don Javier, the collegial Carlist executive commenced cautious {{collaboration with the}} regime. It is not entirely clear how this major change of policy was related to appearance of prince Hugues. According to one theory, the young entourage decided to introduce him <b>banking</b> <b>on</b> a new strategy and posing to present an offer to Franco. According to another, with new long-term perspectives related to his son opening, Don Javier changed course hoping that the regime might one day crown the young prince. One more reading {{has it that the}} changing political course and the introduction of Hugues coincided as results of two independent processes. One way or another, starting 1957 Don Javier was gradually permitting his son to assume more and more roles within Carlism.|$|E
25|$|The short, sharp {{hills in}} the Flemish Ardennes are a {{defining}} {{feature of the}} Ronde and the places where spectators gather in vast numbers to see the race. In recent editions 17 to 19 of these hills are included in the route, although the number is subject to change as some climbs are cut and others included almost every year. Each climb has its own characteristics that present different challenges to the riders. The Kwaremont, is 2.2km but relatively shallow. The Paterberg is short and, at 20 percent, brutally steep. The Koppenberg in Melden is the steepest hill of the race at 22 percent with a bad, very uneven cobbled surface. Its road is also extremely narrow and the high <b>banking</b> <b>on</b> either side turns it into a natural arena. Other famous climbs include the Eikenberg, Molenberg and Taaienberg.|$|E

25|$|After {{the end of}} the 1912–13 season {{a record}} profit was {{announced}} by the club. The money was invested in a replacement for the Olive Grove stand {{on the south side of}} the stadium. The <b>banking</b> <b>on</b> the Spion Kop was also increased in size. The new south stand was completed in time for the first round of the FA Cup on 1 October 1913 against Notts County. It cost £18,000 and included 5,600 seats plus terracing at the front. New offices, dressing rooms, refreshment rooms and a billiard room were also part of the new stand. The second round tie went to a replay on 4 February 1914, which was held in front of a record home crowd of 43,000. However the match was remembered for the collapse of the new retaining wall at the Penistone Road end. It caused 70 injuries and caused the match to be suspended while the casualties were taken to the infirmary.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand's batting effort started quietly, with Irfan Pathan {{using the}} hint of swing to bowl a maiden to captain Fleming first up. But {{inaccurate}} line and length {{in the next five}} overs allowed New Zealand to plunder 62, Fleming hitting five fours from the 5th over, and the run rate raced along. By the end of 15 power play overs, New Zealand had made 112 for no loss, Fleming having made a 51-ball half-century while Astle was on 45. Ganguly turned to his spinners, <b>banking</b> <b>on</b> Virender Sehwag to give him a few tight overs, and he complied. The first over conceded four runs, and in his second he held a return catch as Fleming went for 61. Four balls later, Hamish Marshall was out for 3, and India were in with a small shout. However, well-timed innings from Scott Styris, who made 37, and Craig McMillan with 13, and the occasional awful over – JP Yadav's only contribution to the match was a 14-run over – left New Zealand with 72 in 12.3 overs with six wickets in hand. With Lou Vincent and Nathan Astle in good hitting form – they took 17 off a Harbhajan over as Astle brought up his 100 with his first six of the match – this was no problem, and Vincent won New Zealand the game by hitting Agarkar for four with 11 balls to spare.|$|E

500|$|Though Microsoft used {{forms of}} viral {{marketing}} for promotion (including the alternate reality game or ARG), {{the main focus}} of the company's efforts was traditional media outlets.

The focus on traditional media would help expand the fan base beyond established gamers and convince the public that the game was a cultural milestone.

500|$|From the {{beginning}} the state's banking institutions were {{closely tied to}} the state government's fiscal affairs, made even more challenging due to the state's [...] "extremely limited economic and population base", the economic depression of the late teens and early twenties, a lack of experience in <b>banking</b> <b>on</b> the part of state politicians and citizens, and other factors. [...] "Indiana banking rested on shaky foundation even in the prosperous years preceding the Panic of 1819." [...] To remedy the problem, Jennings signed legislation in 1817 to create the First State Bank of Indiana by converting the Bank of Vincennes, established under a territorial charter in 1814, into the new bank's main headquarters and established three new branches at Corydon, Brookville, and Vevay. The First State Bank soon became a depository of federal funds and was involved in land speculation. The Farmers and Mechanics Bank of Madison, established in 1814, chose to remain separate from the state bank under a territorial charter that was valid until 1835.|$|E
