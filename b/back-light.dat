40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis investigates the characterization of laser produced plasmas and develops applications in opacity experiments using plasma emission as a <b>back-lighting</b> source. A diagnostic is developed to analyse bremsstrahlung emission from hot electrons produced in the laser plasma interaction. Combining a compensating filter technique with an x-ray diode array allows for the hot electron temperature to be deduced with good accuracy (± 0. 5 keV). A layered target comprising 0. 8 um Al and 1. 0 um Fe is used to investigate the opacity of iron plasma. A laser of modest irradiance (~ 10 ^ 15 W cm^- 2) is fired onto the aluminium surface, producing Al K-alpha emission (1. 5 keV) {{which is used to}} measure the opacity of the conductively heated iron layer. The aluminium plasma is characterized using source broadened spectroscopy and continuum emission analysis. The experimental transmission data is in good agreement with 2 D modelling using opacities from the Ionised Materials Package. A line focus <b>back-lighter,</b> produced using a high power laser system, is characterized through imaging the time and spectrally integrated emission profile of the plasma using a crossed-slit camera. The emission profile is used to infer a spatially dependant electron temperature profile. Finally, a Ti K-alpha <b>back-lighter</b> is used to investigate the temporal evolution of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in a laser produced plasma. A target, seeded with an initial perturbation between layers of copper and plastic exhibited Rayleigh-Taylor growth within the first 100 ps of the interaction with a growth rate of 10 ± 2 ns^- 1.

The game.com touchscreen also had a fairly low sensor resolution along with no <b>back-light,</b> so it lacked precision and made it hard to see the on-screen controls.

40|$|A first {{demonstration}} {{has recently}} been made of radiography of implosions using a nonthermal K{alpha} radiation source generated with a high intensity picosecond laser pulse [1]. Absolute source brightness is important in assessing the potential of this diagnostic and we present here measurements and Monte-Carlo simulations of {{the brightness of the}} Ti K{alpha} <b>back-lighter</b> source. The experiment was conducted at the Vulcan laser within the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in the UK. A set of radiographs were taken in which a <b>back-lighting</b> source was produced using a 1 ps CPA beam. The beam delivered an average of 49 J, within an 800 {micro}m by 400 {micro}m elliptical spot, onto a 25 {micro}m thick Ti foil (Figure 1). The first of two instruments used to characterize the K{alpha} source was a spherical Bragg crystal imager (Quartz 20 {bar 2 } 3, 2 d of 0. 2749 nm, radius of curvature 38 cm, aperture 1. 6 cm) used to spatially resolve the emission of the K{alpha} <b>back-lighter</b> [2]. The crystal focused the 4. 5 keV K{alpha} photons with 10 mm spatial resolution and 7. 9 x magnification onto a cooled, 16 -bit, 1 '' x 1 '', 1024 x 1024 pixel CCD chip. The instrument observation angle was normal to the rear axis of the foil. The 2 nd instrument was a single hit CCD spectrometer which was used to measure the absolute K{alpha} yield from the Ti target. The spectrometer consisted of a back-thinned CCD with 2048 x 2048 13. 5 {micro}m square pixels and a filter (100 or 150 {micro}m Ti) that placed the chip in the single hit photon regime. The angle of observation was 41 {sup o} from the rear surface normal of the Ti foil...|$|R

30|$|First, {{methods for}} <b>back-light</b> {{compensation}} detection and operation, {{that are based}} on the (difference of) measured signals in various areas of the image, have intrinsic problems if the object of interest is miss-positioned, or if it leaves the area of interest. The consequence is the severe underexposure of the important foreground object. To detect the change of object position, areas of interest are often set several times larger than the size of the object. However, the average intensity level of the whole metering window can be so high {{and the size of the}} object of interest can be very small, that insufficient <b>back-light</b> compensation occurs and the object details still remain invisible. Second, the changed object position can also give problems to the video-level controller, due to a considerable change of the measured signal because of the large differences in weights of the metering zones. These problems can be solved by dynamic weighting schemes.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study using}} Large Eddy Simulation Coherent Structure Model (LES-CSM), {{of the flow}} around a simplified Ahmed body, {{has been done in}} this work of thesis. The models used are two salient geometries from the experimental investigation performed in [1], and consist, in particular, in two notch-back body geometries. Six simulation are carried out in total, changing Reynolds number and <b>back-light</b> angle of the model’s rear part. The Reynolds numbers used, based on the height of the models and the free stream velocity, are Re = 10000, Re = 30000 and Re = 50000. The <b>back-light</b> angles of the slanted surface with respect to the horizontal roof surface, that characterizes the vehicle, are taken as B = 31. 8 ◦ and B = 42 ◦ respectively. The experimental results in [1] have shown that, depending on the parameter B, asymmetric and symmetric averaged flow over the <b>back-light</b> and in the wake for a symmetric geometry can be observed. The aims of the present work of master thesis are principally two. The first aim is to investigate and confirm the influence of the parameter B on the presence of the asymmetry of the averaged flow, and confirm the features described in the experimental results. The second important aspect is to investigate and observe the influence of the second variable, the Reynolds number, in the developing of the asymmetric flow itself.
