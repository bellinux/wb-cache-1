A parametric study is performed of the effect on <b>base</b> <b>pressure</b> of changes in slit size and cavity depth. The <b>base</b> <b>pressure</b> increases initially with increasing cavity depth, but saturates at a depth which depends on the slit size. The <b>base</b> <b>pressure</b> increases monotonically up to 5 % with increasing slit size for the geometries tested. An upper limit of <b>base</b> <b>pressure</b> recovery of 20 % is extrapolated from the data.

As a second-order effect, for highly asymmetric pressure distributions, the slit produces a <b>base</b> <b>pressure</b> increase not associated with the <b>base</b> <b>pressure</b> asymmetry.

The corrosion resistance was found to increase with increasingly high <b>base</b> <b>pressure</b> (i. e. lower quality vacuum).

From the results is posited that improved corrosion resistance is due to the presence of oxygen (O) being incorporated into the films during deposition resulting an O-containing (i. e. Al-O) alloy.

40|$|Thermal {{annealing}} 4 H-SiC(0001) substrates {{to produce}} epitaxial graphene on Si-terminated SiC was performed using five different procedures, i. e. {{direct and indirect}} current heating at different <b>based</b> <b>pressures</b> and a temperature of about 1300. The aim is to {{study the effects of}} graphene growth under different conditions and also to produce large homogeneous graphene. To investigate the prepared samples, two surface analytical techniques, i. e. low energy electron microscopy (LEEM) and photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) have been used. LEEM was first used to observe the surface morphologies of the prepared samples. In combination with LEEM instrument, low energy electron diffraction (LEED) was used to verify the existence of graphene on SiC substrate. The number of graphene layer was determined by collecting electron reflectivity at different electron energies. The number of dips observed in the electron reflectivity curve corresponds to the number of graphene layer. The experimental results obtained from LEEM and LEED have demonstrated that a film consisting of fairly large domains of 1 and 2 monolayer (ML) graphene was obtained by direct current heating of SiC under high vacuum (HV) condition with the <b>based</b> <b>pressure</b> of 10 - 6 Torr. A domain size in the range of up to about 5 to 10 μm have been observed. Meanwhile another graphene film prepared by the same method and the same temperature but under ultra high vacuum (UHV) condition with the <b>based</b> <b>pressure</b> of 10 - 10 Torr has much smaller domain size of 1 ML graphene compared to that grown under HV condition. We therefore suggested that the <b>based</b> <b>pressure</b> during the graphene growth has a strong influence on the morphology of graphene. This is because the Si evaporation rate is suppressed when heated in a high pressure environment, which normally leads to the improvement of the surface quality. The suppression of the Si evaporation rate has also been verified by a result obtained from the other sample directly heated under much higher <b>based</b> <b>pressure,</b> i. e. in an argon (Ar) environment of 1 atm. In addition to LEEM and LEED, the existence of graphene on SiC substrate has also been verified by the PES measurement. The C 1 s spectrum of graphene sample grown on SiC(0001) substrate showed three components, i. e. bulk SiC, graphene (G) and the buffer layer (B) located at 283. 7 eV, 284. 5 eV and 285. 1 eV, respectively. The intensity ratios of the three components in the C 1 s spectrum were also used to estimate the number of graphene layer.

40|$|The {{sacroiliac}} joints are {{a source}} of low back pain (1) and sacroiliac joint disorders are a common occurrence in clinical practice (2). Sacroiliac dysfunction is considered to be {{the most common cause of}} sacroiliac joint pain and subsequent lower back pain (3). However, the anatomical location of these joints and the lack of a satisfactory criterion standard (the “gold standard”) make the diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction difficult (4). Nevertheless, many different sacroiliac joint tests have been described to detect the sacroiliac dysfunction however none have been validated against any independent criterion standard (5). Furthermore, numerous invalidated tests attempt to diagnose the type of sacroiliac joint dysfunction although they also lack that satisfactory criterion standard (4, 5). The Sacral <b>Base</b> <b>Pressure</b> Test has been shown in a previous study to have good validity as an indicator of sacroiliac dysfunction (6). This study aimed to reconfirm the validity of the Sacral <b>Base</b> <b>Pressure</b> Test in diagnosing sacroiliac joint dysfunction. It also determined the predictive powers of the test in determining which type of sacroiliac joint dysfunction was present. Sixty-two participants underwent a double-blind experimental study where the results from the Sacral <b>Base</b> <b>Pressure</b> Test were compared against a cluster of previously validated tests of sacroiliac joint dysfunction. The cluster of tests gave the diagnosis against which the Sacral <b>Base</b> <b>Pressure</b> Test’s validity and predictive powers were determined. The cluster of tests included Standing Flexion Test, the Iliac Springing Test, Spine Test and Supine Long-Sitting Test. The former two tests only determined the presence of the sacroiliac joint dysfunction, whilst the latter tests also determined the type of dysfunction present. The results occurring in the Sacral <b>Base</b> <b>Pressure</b> Test, namely the external rotation of the feet, were measured using a digital inclinometer. There was no statistically significant difference in the results of the Sacral <b>Base</b> <b>Pressure</b> Test between the types of sacroiliac joint dysfunction. Only when the Sacral <b>Base</b> <b>Pressure</b> Test was performed on the right of the patient and when it analysed right-sided dysfunction types, was there a slight statistically significant difference (P = 0. 0529) evident in the results. In terms of the results of validity, the Sacral <b>Base</b> <b>Pressure</b> Test was useful in identifying positive values of sacroiliac joint dysfunction but was not useful in identifying the negative values. The Sacral <b>Base</b> <b>Pressure</b> Test did not accurately diagnose patients with positive test results, however it was fairly helpful in correctly diagnosing patients with negative test results. The Sacral <b>Base</b> <b>Pressure</b> Test had only a “slight” agreement with the diagnosis according to the Landis and Koch Guidelines for Kappa interpretation. At this stage of research into the Sacral <b>Base</b> <b>Pressure</b> Test, the results are varied.
