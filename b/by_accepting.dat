5|$|Walter, bishop-elect, {{travelled}} to {{the papal}} court at Avignon, and was provided (appointed) as bishop by Pope Innocent on 18 June 1361. The papal letter of provision expressed displeasure that the chapter (by electing) and Walter (<b>by</b> <b>accepting</b> the election) were ignoring a previous papal reservation of the bishopric. Pope Innocent quashed the election, but nevertheless agreed to appoint (provide) Walter to the bishopric.|$|E

5|$|An {{analogy is}} also made between Gawain's {{trial and the}} Biblical test that Adam {{encounters}} in the Garden of Eden. Adam succumbs to Eve just as Gawain surrenders to Bertilak's wife <b>by</b> <b>accepting</b> the girdle. Although Gawain sins by putting his faith in the girdle and not confessing when he is caught, the Green Knight pardons him, thereby allowing {{him to become a}} better Christian by learning from his mistakes. Through the various games played and hardships endured, Gawain finds his place within the Christian world.|$|E
5|$|As the {{disaster}} in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role {{in what they}} saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown; it was also argued that the federal response was limited {{as a result of the}} Iraq War and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods. Bush responded to mounting criticism <b>by</b> <b>accepting</b> full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker {{continued}} practising law. In 1951, {{he gained}} national attention <b>by</b> <b>accepting</b> the Atherton case, {{in which a}} young telegraph operator {{had been accused of}} negligently causing a train crash by omitting crucial information from a message. Twenty-one people were killed, mostly Canadian troops bound for Korea. Diefenbaker paid $1,500 and sat a token bar examination to join the Law Society of British Columbia to take the case, and gained an acquittal, prejudicing the jury against the Crown prosecutor and pointing out a previous case in which interference had caused information to be lost in transmission.|$|E

5|$|His health declining, Baltimore's {{persistence}} {{over the}} charter finally {{paid off in}} 1632. The king first granted him a location south of Jamestown, but Baltimore asked the king to reconsider in response to opposition from other investors interested in settling the new land of Carolina into a sugar plantation. Baltimore eventually compromised <b>by</b> <b>accepting</b> redrawn boundaries {{to the north of}} the Potomac River, on either side of the Chesapeake Bay. The charter was about to pass when the fifty-two-year-old Baltimore died in his lodgings at Lincoln's Inn Fields, on 15 April 1632. Five weeks later, on 20 June 1632, the charter for Maryland passed the seals.|$|E
5|$|In Smith's view, the {{opportunity}} to achieve exaltation extended to all humanity; those who died with no opportunity to accept saving ordinances could achieve exaltation <b>by</b> <b>accepting</b> them in the afterlife through ordinances performed on their behalf. Smith said that children who died in their innocence would be guaranteed to rise at the resurrection and receive exaltation. Apart from those who committed the eternal sin, Smith taught that even the wicked and disbelieving would achieve a degree of glory in the afterlife.|$|E

5|$|On 22 July, {{a council}} {{was held in}} the Church of the Holy Sepulchre to {{establish}} a king for the newly created Kingdom of Jerusalem. Raymond of Toulouse at first refused to become king, perhaps attempting to show his piety, but probably hoping that the other nobles would insist upon his election anyway. Godfrey, who had become the more popular of the two after Raymond's actions at the siege of Antioch, did no damage to his own piety <b>by</b> <b>accepting</b> a position as secular leader. Raymond was incensed at this development and took his army out into the countryside.|$|E

5|$|In January 2013, Jean-Claude Van Damme {{was rumored}} to be co-starring {{alongside}} Jaa; in reality, he was never available due to scheduling issues, and as a result, Lundgren was cast as an alternative. The film entered production in April 2013, but {{came to an abrupt}} halt after three months of filming. Sahamongkol Film International filed a $49–50 million lawsuit against Jaa, Universal Pictures, and United International Pictures, claiming Jaa was in breach of his contract <b>by</b> <b>accepting</b> a role in Fast and Furious 7.

5|$|Over {{the next}} two years Richardson {{appeared}} in six plays in London ranging from Peter Pan (as Mr Darling and Captain Hook) to Cornelius, an allegorical play written for and dedicated to him by JBPriestley. Cornelius ran for two months; this was less than expected, and left Richardson with a gap in engagements {{in the second half of}} 1935. He filled it <b>by</b> <b>accepting</b> an invitation from Katharine Cornell and Guthrie McClintic to play Mercutio in their production of Romeo and Juliet on a US tour and on Broadway. Romeo was played by Maurice Evans and Juliet by Cornell. Richardson's performance greatly impressed American critics, and Cornell invited him to return to New York to co-star with her in Macbeth and Antony and Cleopatra, though nothing came of this.|$|E
5|$|Also {{during his}} senior year, James was the {{centerpiece}} of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, he skirted state amateur bylaws <b>by</b> <b>accepting</b> a Hummer H2 from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing LeBron's future earning power as a professional athlete. This prompted {{an investigation by the}} Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the gift from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source. Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in him being stripped of his high school sports eligibility. James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season. In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.|$|E
5|$|During the Abbasid Revolution, however, he {{was forced}} to submit to the Abbasid armies under Abu Muslim. As one of Abu Muslim's vassals, he {{supported}} the latter in his quarrel with the Caliph al-Mansur (r. 754–775). After the Caliph had Abu Muslim murdered in 755, Khurshid supported the anti-Abbasid rebellion of Sunbadh, who entrusted part of Abu Muslim's treasure to Khurshid's keeping. When Sunbadh's revolt was defeated, Sunbadh fled to Tabaristan, but was killed there by one of Khurshid's cousins, ostensibly because he had failed to show the man proper respect. It is possible, however, that the murder was instigated by Khurshid, in the hope of acquiring the remainder of Abu Muslim's treasure. Al-Mansur sent his son and heir, al-Mahdi (r. 775–785), to recover the treasure of Abu Muslim. Khurshid denied having it, and al-Mansur tried to unseat Khurshid by crowning one of his cousins as ispahbadh. This did not have the desired effect of challenging the loyalty of Khurshid's subjects, but Khurshid was eventually forced to accommodate the Abbasids <b>by</b> <b>accepting</b> an increase in the annual tribute, which brought it to the level paid to the Sassanids.|$|E
