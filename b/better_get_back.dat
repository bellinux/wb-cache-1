25|$|Calley: You <b>better</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> in that chopper {{and mind}} your own business.|$|E
2500|$|Around {{the time}} he was {{developing}} the lyrics to [...] "Get Back", McCartney satirised the [...] "Rivers of Blood speech" [...] by former British Cabinet minister Enoch Powell in a brief jam that has become known as the [...] "Commonwealth Song". The lyrics included a line [...] "You'd <b>better</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to your Commonwealth homes". The group improvised various temporary lyrics for [...] "Get Back" [...] leading to what has become known in Beatles' folklore as the [...] "No Pakistanis" [...] version. This version is more racially charged, and addresses attitudes toward immigrants in the United States and the United Kingdom: [...] "...don't need no Puerto Ricans living in the USA"; and [...] "don't dig no Pakistanis taking all the people's jobs".|$|E
2500|$|The {{reduction}} in weight {{and change in}} center of gravity caused by {{the removal of the}} pilot, coupled with the blast force of his seat rocketing out of the plane pushing the nose of the aircraft down, which had been trimmed by Faust for takeoff and idle throttle, caused the aircraft to recover from the spin. One of the other pilots on the mission was reported to have radioed Faust during his descent by parachute that [...] "you'd <b>better</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> in it!". From his parachute, Faust watched incredulously as the now-pilotless aircraft descended and skidded to a halt in a farmer's field near Big Sandy, Montana. Faust drifted into the nearby mountains. He was later rescued by local residents using snowmobiles.|$|E

6000|$|... "I hadn't {{any idea}} it was so late," [...] exclaimed Dick. [...] "We'd <b>better</b> be <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> to the hotel, or we won't get our money's worth out of that room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; we are off on {{a hunting}} trip," [...] {{answered}} Giant. [...] "And, by the way, we had <b>better</b> be <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> to the boat," [...] he added to his chums.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{this is my}} bunk-house; anyhow, I'm in charge. Guess you'd <b>better</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to the bosses' shacks, {{where you}} belong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “A breeze!” he exclaimed. “Perhaps we’d <b>better</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> {{while we}} can. There won’t be much water up the channel at lowest ebb.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps we had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> {{and pitch}} some {{water on the}} roof," [...] he suggested. [...] "I {{was too busy to}} think of that before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Rum business,' said Tony, as he rejoined Welch on terra firma. 'Wonder if they'll {{catch the}} chap. We'd <b>better</b> be <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> to the House now. It struck the quarter years ago.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{certainly}} is very handy," [...] said Peter politely. [...] "I {{think we are}} going to have more rain, and I'd <b>better</b> be <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> to the dear Old Briarpatch. Very much obliged to you, Mr. Toad. I think you are very wonderful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We had <b>better</b> be <b>getting</b> <b>back,</b> Lena, {{since we}} can't stay {{all night in}} the woods--or {{anywhere}} else, for that matter. We are the slaves of this infernal surprise which has been sprung on us by--shall I say fate?--your fate, or mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only this: It {{strikes me}} that you need looking after. We can't stay here indefinitely. Hadn't you <b>better</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to Vancouver before your English friends ruin you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{want to get}} {{mixed up}} in any fight!" [...] exclaimed Ward Porton. [...] "Maybe we had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to the United States side of the river." ...|$|E
6000|$|Carroll {{spread out}} his hands. [...] "Only this--I {{think you need}} looking after. We can't stay here indefinitely. Hadn't you <b>better</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to Vancouver before your English friends ruin you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anyway, I {{want the}} calico," [...] said he. [...] "Please {{put it aside}} for me, and I'll come in to-morrow and settle for it. And now {{it seems to me}} that if we want any supper we had <b>better</b> be <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> to the inn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{that the}} snow has stopped falling, I suppose we had <b>better</b> try to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to Crumville," [...] said Laura to her brother.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't {{know about}} that," [...] {{and the girl}} tossed her head. [...] "They {{have a right to}} act in the movies if they want to. They've got to earn their living some way, I suppose. Don't you think we had <b>better</b> be <b>getting</b> <b>back,</b> Dave?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was almost}} certain we'd catch it," [...] said Dave. He {{unscrewed}} the pump from the wheel. [...] "Roger, we had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to that hotel {{just as fast}} as we can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess we'd <b>better</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to the settee," [...] Carrots said, {{looking at}} the officer an instant, {{as if to make}} out whether the latter was really in earnest in this last movement.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] said Mr. Tucker. [...] "As {{a matter}} of fact, I had taken {{a room at the}} George Hotel for a week, but I suppose I had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> home again." ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{question}} {{always brought}} the shadow {{back to my}} face. [...] "Not very well,--but we hope she'll be <b>better</b> when she <b>gets</b> <b>back</b> here among her own folks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have <b>better</b> {{reasons for}} <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> {{than the rest}} of us; though I've no {{particular}} wish to loiter up here. Break the trail, Blake; due south by compass!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish--" [...] said Ethel, disappointed, but cheering up {{the next}} minute. [...] "I do believe it is having nothing to do. You will be <b>better</b> when you <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to school on Monday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now we'd <b>better</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to our {{rooms and}} get into bed as soon as possible," [...] said Jack. [...] "They may report us, {{and some of the}} professors may come around to investigate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is true, Tom," [...] {{answered}} his wife, [...] "but don't {{you think we}} had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to the hotel and go to bed? I heard Dick say something about {{a long day of}} it to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can make}} out four, {{and there are more}} behind," [...] said the trooper. [...] "It's a sure thing. Snow's deep, and, as we figured, they'll stick to the trail. Guess you'd <b>better</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> and tell the Sergeant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{will think}} it over, my dear. Now, I {{think you had}} <b>better</b> be <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> to the hotel; the sun has gone in and the clouds are half-way down the mountains. I {{think that we are}} going to have another snowstorm, so you and Ada had better hurry. You have had {{experience}} of the suddenness with which storms come on here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is no telling. I {{think we}} had <b>better</b> be <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> to the house,--father doesn't seem to be {{anywhere}} about. There is a tree branch. You can tie the game to that, and we can both pull it down the creek {{to the river and}} then over to the burn. It won't be worth while bringing a pony out to do it." ...|$|R
50|$|Only a {{few days}} after {{beginning}} their pursuit of the dream of dropping out of society, David and Linda are living in a trailer park, almost broke, working dead end jobs and accountable to brats. They decide that it is <b>better</b> to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to their old lifestyle as soon as possible. They point the Winnebago toward New York, where David begs for his old job back.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not that way! Keep {{your hand}} firm and your arm stiff," [...] she said, and putting her foot on his hand, sprang to the saddle. Then {{she turned and}} smiled. [...] "You have pluck, but you had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> on board and change your clothes." ...|$|E
6000|$|Land of our Birth, we {{pledge to}} thee, [...] 143 'Less {{you want your}} toes trod off you'd <b>better</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> [...] at once', [...] 138 'Let us now praise famous men', [...] 116 Life's all getting and giving, [...] 215 Look, you have cast out Love! What Gods are these, [...] 30 ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Less {{you want}} your toes trod off you'd <b>better</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> at once, For the {{bullocks}} are walking two by two, The byles are walking two by two, And the elephants bring the guns. Ho! Yuss! Great--big--long--black--forty-pounder guns: Jiggery-jolty to and fro, Each {{as big as a}} launch in tow-- Blind--dumb--broad-breeched--beggars o' battering-guns.|$|E
6000|$|Benson {{gave him}} a {{sympathetic}} nod. [...] "One can understand that; you have <b>better</b> reasons for <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> {{than the rest of}} us, though I've no particular wish to loiter up here. Break the trail, Blake; due south by compass!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As to that I can't say. I believe, though, it is <b>better</b> that I <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to Tarhe's camp {{before we}} have any trouble with the Indians. I am anxious to get there before Girty or some of his agents." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hech, sirs! {{guide us}} a'! {{to burn the}} engines? that's a great waste--Had ye na <b>better</b> try to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> part o' your hundred pounds wi' the sale o' the materials?" [...] he continued, with a tone of {{affected}} condolence.|$|R
