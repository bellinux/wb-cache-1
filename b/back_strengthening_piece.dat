The health condition of batik craftsman is one off factor in the sustainability of batik in Indonesian because the capital of craftsman working productivity. Workloads such as position and wrong posture at works can lead to complaints of the musculoskeletal system. One of them is low back pain (LBP). LBP can reduce the functional abilities of the craftsmen. LBP is a very common problem in people working age. Structured exercise an option for the treatment of low back pain. Exercise to reduce pain and improve functional activities. The most important component in LBP is strength training exercises and one spinal stability with <b>back</b> <b>strengthening</b> exercises and core stability exercise. The purpose of this study to determine that core stability training exercise is better than a <b>back</b> <b>strengthening</b> exercise in increasing the functional activity of the batik craftsmen with low back pain in Pekalongan. The research designs is experiment true by the one group pre-test and post-test group design, conducted in January to August 2014. Samples were taken by purposive sampling with inclusion and exclusion criteria. In this study consist of 28 people with batik craftsmen low back pain who have worked a minimum of 5 - 20 years. Subjects were divided into two groups: group 1 (were given training <b>back</b> <b>strengthening</b> exercises) and group 2 (were given training core stability exercise). Measurement instruments to assess the functional activity used the Pain Disability Index (PDI). The result of statistical test with paired t-test found that the reduction in PDI scores of group 1 with p value = 0. 001 and data reduction PDI score group 2 p value = 0. 001.

Objective: To investigate whether specific asymmetrical sports therapy exercises rather than symmetrical <b>back</b> <b>strengthening</b> can increase EMG amplitudes of paraspinal muscles in the concavity {{of the curve}}. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Laboratory. Participants: 16 patients with idiopathic scoliosis. Interventions: Patients performed 4 back-strengthening exercises (front press, lat pull-down, roman chair, bent-over barbell row) during 1 test session. Each exercise was performed in a symmetrical and asymmetrical variant and repeated 3 times. Main Outcome Measure: EMG amplitudes of the paraspinal muscles were recorded in the thoracic and lumbar apexes of the scoliotic curve during each exercise. Ratios of convex- to concave-side EMG activity were calculated. Results: Statistical analysis revealed that the asymmetrical variants of front press at the lumbar level (P =. 002) and roman chair and bent-over barbell row at the thoracic level (P <. 0001,. 001 respectively) were superior in increasing EMG amplitudes in the concavity of the scoliotic curve. Conclusions: Specific asymmetrical exercises increase EMG amplitudes of paraspinal muscles in the concavity.
