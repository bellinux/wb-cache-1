5000|$|Birmingham {{was located}} on land owned by Thomas A. Grubbs in 1849, laid out and platted in 1853 and {{incorporated}} in 1860. Early residents included L. <b>S.</b> <b>Locker,</b> Thomas Love and Thomas C. Grubbs. [...] Birmingham enjoyed prosperity {{shortly after the}} end of the Civil War when a stave mill and timber business employed over 200 people. [...] Birmingham was named after Birmingham, England in hope that the city would establish its European namesake's iron industry; the area had its own nascent iron industry, some remains of which can be viewed today in the Land Between the Lakes. [...] Collins' History of Kentucky states that in 1874 Birmingham had a population of 322; by contrast, the county seat of Benton, Kentucky then had a population of only 158. [...] By 1894 Birmingham had five churches, two schools, two hotels, four dry goods and general stores, three grocers, two millinery shops, two wagon and blacksmith shops and a drug store. [...] By 1929 Birmingham still had around 600 residents.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} in {{peripheral nervous system}} returns to the cell body of neurons in central nervous system in a retrograde manner which leads to brain and spinal degeneration. It is probable that Achillea biebersteinii might prevent the injury progress. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of alcholic extract of Achillea biebersteinii leaves on spinal α motoneurons degenarion after sciatic nerve compression in rats. Methods: 30 male wistar rats were divided randomly into groups of control, compression, compression with treatment of 50, 75, 100 mg/kg doses. Sciatic nerve was exposed to compression for 60 <b>s</b> using <b>locker</b> pincers. Extract injection was done intraperitoneally {{in the first and}} second weeks after compression. Then 28 days after compression under perfusion method, the lumber spinal cord was sampled. After cutting and coloring, the density of motoneurons was measured using dissector methods. Results: The study results demonstrated a meaningful difference between compression and control groups in regard with neuronal density (P= 0. 000). Neuronal density showed also a significant meaningful increase (P< 0. 01) in alcoholic extract treatment groups of 50, 75, 100 mg/kg compared to the compression group. Conclusion: The study findings revealed that Alcohlic extracts of Achillea biebersteinii leaves, containing growth and regeneration factors, has neuroprotective effect on spinal cord alpha motoneurons after injury. The extract with 75 mg/kg dose was reported as the most effective one. ...|$|R

For {{thousands}} of years, this truth remained unalterable; but now, the rapid development of underwater technology is prying open the once impenetrable realm of Davy Jones 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>locker.</b> This technology gives us access to the seas darkest secrets, and opens new windows to our past. Indeed, what once only lingered at the edge of dreams is now a reality. The sea has stubbornly begun to yield its treasures to those brave enough to search. In recent years, enterprising adventurers have reclaimed pirates 2 ̆ 7 gold, discovered the riches of past empires, 2 ̆ 7 and peered into the ironic serenity of disaster. Bringing these artifacts to the light of the modem world has given a new voice to the bones of forgotten people, and has raised their stories from the dead. Unfortunately, wherever there are bones, there are sure to be scavengers. Gold fever, which has infected some unscrupulous treasure hunters and commercial salvors, as well as chronic under funding of archaeologists, threatens to destroy what remains of America 2 ̆ 7 s unfound maritime heritage. To save what remains, we must immediately improve and clarify the purpose and structure of our underwater historic resource laws, and create a workable management plan for the recovery and management of these resources. In order to preserve the knowledge that our historic shipwrecks could provide, Americans must begin to appreciate the value that these wrecks have as historic resources, and must demand that they be efficiently utilized in the best interests of all our citizens and future generations. This appreciation must be converted into laws which acknowledge and are based upon three principles: 1) that wreck sites are often also grave sites and should be treated with dignity and respect; 2) that the most important aspect of a historic wreck site is its potential to contribute to our knowledge of human history; and 3) that the public is entitled to the knowledge obtained from such wreck sites. Adherence to these principles would create laws which would mandate thorough and efficient excavation of sites, as well as full analysis and publication of the excavator 2 ̆ 7 s findings. To best utilize America 2 ̆ 7 s historic shipwreck resources, a management scheme should be established that will encourage private salvors to work with archaeologists and the government under the direction of admiralty courts. This management scheme, termed 2 ̆ 2 cooperative archaeology, 2 ̆ 2 could be established by fine-tuning the Abandoned Shipwreck Act (ASA) and admiralty law, as well as further establishing a code of ethics that all commercial salvors and archaeologists would be mandated to apply when excavating historic shipwrecks. This Comment will evaluate the debate for and against traditional salvage, full cultural resource preservation, and 2 ̆ 2 cooperative archaeology 2 ̆ 2 as means toward the efficient utilization of historic shipwreck resources. It will also examine the current state of historical preservation law, with special emphasis on the ASA, and analyze what changes must be made to transform the current legal environment into one that will provide for improved resource recovery and management through the encouragement of cooperation between the government, salvors, and archaeologists...|$|R
30|$|HCV protein {{translation}} is {{mediated by the}} highly conserved IRES structure and 80 S ribosome assembly on the IRES is a process including multiple steps that are mediated by specific IRES structural domains. The SLII domain is of great interest because it is indispensable for the conformational change of the 40 S subunit induced by IRES binding (Spahn et al., 2001; Filbin and Kieft, 2011; Boehringer et al., 2005). Interaction of the SLII domain with ribosomal protein 5 (RPS 5) is required for 80 S ribosome assembly (Bhat et al., 2015), and {{has been reported to}} promote eIF 2 -GDP release. Further, deletion of this domain blocks 80 S assembly after 48 <b>S</b> complex formation (<b>Locker</b> et al., 2007). RBM 24 blocks the formation of the 80 S ribosome complex after 40 / 48 S complex formation, similar to what occurs following SLII domain deletion. It is likely that the binding of RBM 24 to the 5 ′-UTR does not influence the interaction of the IRES with 40 S ribosome but it does interfere with the 80 S ribosome assembly.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{two-dimensional}} {{gel electrophoresis}} has identified the gene products A 14 L (p 16) and A 13 L (p 8) as abundant membrane proteins of the first infectious form of vaccinia virus, the intracellular mature virus (IMV; O. N. Jensen, T. Houthaeve, A. Shevchenko, S. Cudmore, T. Ashford, M. Mann, G. Griffiths, J. Krijnse Locker, J. Virol. 70 : 7485 - 7497, 1996). In this study, these two proteins were characterized in detail. In infected cells, both proteins localize {{not only to the}} viral membranes but also to tubular-cisternal membranes of the intermediate compartment, defined by the use of antibodies to either rab 1 A or p 21, which colocalize with rab 1 A (J. Krijnse <b>Locker,</b> <b>S.</b> Schleich, D. Rodriguez, B. Goud, E. J. Snijder, and G. Griffiths, J. Biol. Chem. 271 : 14950 - 14958, 1996). Both proteins appear to reach this destination via cotranslational insertion into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, as shown by in vitro translation and translocation experiments. Whereas p 16 probably spans the membrane twice, p 8 is inserted into the membrane by means of its single NH 2 -terminal hydrophobic domain, adopting a topology which leaves the C terminus exposed to the cytoplasm. Combined immunocytochemical and biochemical data show that p 16 {{is a member of the}} inner of the two IMV membrane layers, whereas p 8 localizes to both the inner and the outer membrane. These findings are discussed with respect to our model of IMV membrane assembly...|$|R

I submitted my statement {{in response to the}} University Steering Committee on NCAA Certification 2 ̆ 7 s request for feedback on a draft report and suggested that the 2 ̆ 2 joke 2 ̆ 2 behind the pink d 6 cor traded in sexist and homophobic values. As such, I concluded that it belonged in the comprehensive analysis of gender equity that the committee was preparing. I immediately received hundreds of hateful e-mails and was the subject of thousands of invidious online postings. The content of these messages intrigued the national media, whose reporting fueled the controversy for several months. The controversy serves as a barometer of cultural values at the intersection of feminism and football that are both disappointing and useful to scholars and advocates of Title IX. The reaction to my statement from both within and beyond the 2 ̆ 2 Hawkeye Nation 2 ̆ 2 proves how deeply hegemonic patriarchal ideology is entrenched in football culture. Compromises involving football are often necessary to resolve gender disparities in college athletics, so this evidence suggests that cultural values must change before the guarantees of Title IX can ever be fully realized...|$|R
40|$|The {{more limited}} {{interaction}} {{of children with}} the environment outside their schools because {{of the changes in}} parenting and the excessive use of gadgets, is the background of the thought to present an educational-recreational facility as an option to activities in Surabaya. “Interior Design of Multiple Intelligence Based Child and Teen Activity Center in Surabaya” accommodates children and teenagers aged 10 - 15 years old to interact, develop, and learn in a safe and cozy outside-school-environment. The method used in this design process is design thinking in 6 steps, which are (1) Empathize and Define, (2) Research, (3) Ideate, (4) Prototype, (5) Test, and (6) Implement. The design concept was made with reference to the basic idea of ‘Multiple Intelligence 2 ̆ 7 (a theory of human intelligences by Howard Gardner, 1983), which is applied to the zoning and grouping of the facility. The design involves children 2 ̆ 7 s and teen 2 ̆ 7 s experience to run activities according to their interest and talent; which the Multiple Intelligence Theory categorized into Logic-Mathematical, Linguistic, Musical-Rhythmic, Naturalistic, Kinesthetic, Visual-Spatial, Interpersonal and Intrapersonal. To complete the facility, there are various supporting facilities such as the lobby, parent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> lounge, back-office, <b>locker</b> room, mini amphitheater and a canteen. The benefits that can be felt by children and teens in Surabaya in the presence of this activity center is the availability of facilities for the development of interests and talents in a positive, aesthetic, and integrated way...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{demonstrates that}} if done with care, combat art has potential to effect healthy change for audiences, artists, {{and in some}} cases the troops themselves. To do so it engages with American artists in four different media—poetry, painting, film, and dance—who use journalistic methods to represent the visceral experience of fighting on the ground in Iraq. I examine how these artists exploit and expand generic and formal conventions in order to represent life in combat zones and to help reintegrate troops back into the civilian community when they return home. I contend, also, that scholars of the humanities and hard sciences have much to learn from each other about the stakes and potential next steps for the arts of embodied perception. ^ I begin with a chapter on methodology, arguing that biology and cognitive psychology can offer useful vocabulary and important insights to help us investigate why the artists I discuss in my dissertation go to such lengths to experience war personally or offer audiences the chance to personally meet those who have been there. I use a phenomenological approach, supported by recent scientific research on human cognition, to enact such a dialogue among not only Jacques Derrida, Jean Baudrillard, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, but also psychologists James J. Gibson and Ulric Neisser, as well as neuroscientists Merlin Donald, Eric Kandel, and Antonio Damasio. The discoveries of psychologists and neuroscientists present solid, multidisciplinary ground for exploring art that seeks to represent these memories. ^ Chapter 2 explores the poetry of Brian Turner, an Iraq war veteran, focusing on his 2005 collection Here, Bullet. As much poetry from past wars has done, Turner 2 ̆ 7 s work seeks to approximate the visceral experience of combat in a clever blend of rhythm, metaphor, and other devices. I cite the multidisciplinary work of linguists such as George Lakoff, Mark Johnson, and Mark Turner to argue that Turner 2 ̆ 7 s attention to embodied metaphor can afford readers important insights to sensations, changing recollections, and latent problems that come from experiencing combat intensely and over a long duration. This textual practice, common in combat poetry, presents readers with a problematic first-person model that is difficult (if it is possible) to evoke in traditional textual news forms. ^ In chapter 3, I examine the work of Steve Mumford, a New York painter, who embedded himself with American troops after the fall of Baghdad on ad-hoc press credentials from an online art magazine. Looking at his work presents an opportunity for scholars and policy makers to debate whether on-scene paintings provide a view of the war that warrants a painter 2 ̆ 7 s repeated journeys into harm 2 ̆ 7 s way. I consider what his work can show, if anything, about the assumptions that correspondents, editors, and viewers make in composing, producing, and consuming images of the daily struggles on the ground in Iraq, and I ask whether the insights we gain from looking at his paintings are significantly different from ones we might derive from photojournalism. ^ Chapter 4 engages with films about Iraq that live in a hybrid space between fiction and nonfiction, focusing on three examples: Brian De Palma 2 ̆ 7 s Redacted, Katherine Bigelow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> The Hurt <b>Locker,</b> and David Simon and Ed Burns 2 ̆ 7 s Generation Kill. These films employ visual, aural, and rhetorical devices commonly used in documentaries and newscasts, yet they are shot outside of Iraq and feature professional actors. These films exploit the blurriness between fact and fiction not just for rhetorical advantage, but to more effectively pull a skeptical and visually savvy audience into their stories, inviting us to see combat on a character level. I argue that far from attempting to open questions about the nature of perception and memory of combat, each of these presentations advocates its own singular narrative of Iraq combat, but studying them as a group can prompt viewers to ask important questions about the supposed reality of events depicted in independent documentaries and the various kinds of moving-picture news. ^ The fifth chapter, on dance, considers the work of a choreographer attempting not only to represent the war 2 ̆ 7 s action but also to welcome veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) safely back into the civilian world. Victoria Marks hosts workshops between veterans with PTSD, antiwar activists, and artists, bringing them into her dance studio and introducing them to a range of verbal and movement-based creative exercises. The resulting vignettes are stitched together into an evening length performance, including call-and-response conversations between the performers and the audience. I combine neurological scholarship on memory with the clinical trauma theory of Judith Herman, Bessel van der Kolk, and others to illustrate that while this dance project should not be considered therapy, it can provide a powerful set of cathartic, communal experiences for veterans and citizens who otherwise would not interact meaningfully. ...|$|R
