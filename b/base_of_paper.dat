40|$|The {{structure}} of hadrons consisting of three static color sources in fundamental (baryons) or adjoint (three-gluon glueballs) representations is studied. The static potentials of glueballs {{as well as}} gluon field distributions in glueballs and baryons are calculated {{in the framework of}} field correlator method. 1. The study of the gluon field structure in hadrons is important for the deep understanding of the strong interaction physics. Interesting results on the baryon flux structure were obtained recently in the maximally abelian gauge on the lattice [1]. We demonstrate below how to perform calculations in gauge invariant way using the field correlator method relyed directly on QCD. The static potential in baryon was considered in detail in [2] at this conference, and we will extensively refer to this talk in what follows. We start with the calculations of static potentials in three-gluon glueballs. This part of the talk presents the results from [3]. In the rest of the talk the gluon field distributions in hadrons are discussed on the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> [4], [5], [6]. In contrast to baryons, the gauge-invariant extended wave function of glueballs may have both Y-type and triangular structure.
