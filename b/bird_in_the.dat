5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} (Spinus tristis) {{is a small}} North American <b>bird</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> finch family.

5|$|The Choiseul pigeon (Microgoura meeki) is an {{extinct species}} of <b>bird</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pigeon and dove family, Columbidae.

The last confirmed sighting was in 1904. Other common names were Solomons crested pigeon, Solomon Islands crowned-pigeon and Kuvojo.|$|E

5|$|The brolga (Antigone rubicunda), {{formerly}} known as the native companion, is a <b>bird</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crane family. It has also been given the name Australian crane, a term coined in 1865 by well-known ornithological artist John Gould in his Birds of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses live {{much longer}} than other birds; they delay {{breeding}} for longer and invest more effort into fewer young. Most species survive upwards of 50 years, the oldest recorded being a Laysan albatross named Wisdom that was ringed in 1956 as a mature adult and hatched another chick in February 2017, making her at least 66 years old. She is the oldest confirmed wild bird {{as well as the}} oldest banded <b>bird</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world.|$|E
50|$|Subsequent {{oscillations}} {{in climate}} {{are thought to}} have resulted in a degree of hybridisation between the groups with a subsequent split leading to the presence of brown-bellied <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western Kimberly and residual genes of brown-bellied <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western portion of the central-eastern white-bellied group.|$|R

5|$|Like other {{nuthatch}}es, the white-breasted nuthatch forages for insects on {{trunks and}} branches {{and is able}} to move head-first down trees. Seeds form a substantial part of its winter diet, as do acorns and hickory nuts that were stored by the <b>bird</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fall. The nest is in a hole in a tree, and the breeding pair may smear insects around the entrance as a deterrent to squirrels. Adults and young may be killed by hawks, owls, and snakes, and forest clearance may lead to local habitat loss, but this is a common species with no major conservation concerns over most of its range.|$|E
5|$|Of eggs laid, 65–93% hatch successfully, and 75–92% of {{the chicks}} {{go on to}} fledge. The {{productivity}} (young fledged per nest) varies with location, level of predation and quality of habitat, but the national figure for the UK was 2.5. The adult annual survival rate is 43% (males 46%, females 29%), and 36% of juveniles live through their first year. The typical life expectancy is two years, but the record is 13years and 10months for a <b>bird</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Czech Republic.|$|E
5|$|One species, {{the cattle}} egret, was {{historically}} an African <b>bird.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 20th century this bird colonized North America {{and is now}} found throughout the lower 48 states of the United States. The cattle egret is the only Old World bird to establish itself in North America in historical times without being introduced by humans. As such, it is not marked as introduced on this list. Neither is the glossy ibis, which probably had a similar history.|$|E

5|$|The African crake (Crex egregia) is a <b>bird</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rail {{family that}} breeds {{in most of}} sub-Saharan Africa away from the arid south and southwest. It is {{seasonally}} common in most of its range other than the rainforests and areas that have low annual rainfall. This crake is a partial migrant, {{moving away from the}} equator as soon as the rains provide sufficient grass cover to allow it to breed elsewhere. There have been a few records of vagrant birds reaching Atlantic islands. This species nests {{in a wide variety of}} grassland types, and agricultural land with tall crops may also be used.|$|E
5|$|The Alpine chough , or yellow-billed chough, (Pyrrhocorax graculus) is a <b>bird</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crow family, one of {{only two}} species in the genus Pyrrhocorax. Its two {{subspecies}} breed in high mountains from Spain eastwards through southern Europe and North Africa to Central Asia and Nepal, and it may nest at a higher altitude than any other bird. The eggs have adaptations to the thin atmosphere that improve oxygen take-up and reduce water loss.|$|E
5|$|The Inaccessible Island rail (Atlantisia rogersi) {{is a small}} bird of {{the rail}} family, Rallidae. It is the only species in the genus Atlantisia. Endemic to Inaccessible Island in the Tristan Archipelago in the {{isolated}} south Atlantic, it is notable for being the smallest extant flightless <b>bird</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world. The species was described by physician Percy Lowe in 1923 but had first come {{to the attention of}} scientists 50 years earlier. The Inaccessible Island rail's closest relatives are uncertain but may be crakes in the genus Laterallus.|$|E

5|$|The black honeyeater (Sugomel nigrum) is {{a species}} of <b>bird</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> honeyeater family Meliphagidae, and the sole species in the genus Sugomel. The black honeyeater {{exhibits}} sexual dimorphism, with the male being black and white while the female is a speckled grey-brown; immature birds look like the female. The species is endemic to Australia, and ranges widely across the arid areas of the continent, through open woodland and shrubland, particularly {{in areas where the}} emu bush and related species occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{garden warbler}} {{was given the}} {{binomial}} name Motacilla borin by the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert in 1783. The current genus name is from Modern Latin silvia, a woodland nymph, related to silva, a wood. The specific borin is derived from a local name for the <b>bird</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Genoa area of Italy; it derives from the Latin bos, ox, because the warbler was believed to accompany oxen.|$|E

5|$|The {{white-naped xenopsaris}} (Xenopsaris albinucha), {{also known as}} the reed becard and white-naped becard, is a species of suboscine <b>bird</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family Tityridae, {{the only member of the}} genus Xenopsaris. It is found in South America, in humid {{subtropical}} and tropical savanna climates in most of the countries east of the Andes: Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina. Living in open woodland and other open forest habitats, it is mostly sedentary, though some populations may be migratory. The species, which is closely related to becards and tityras, was thought to be either a tyrant-flycatcher or cotinga, before it was placed in Tityridae.|$|E
5|$|The woodland's {{position}} on the transition zone between the wheatbelt and the jarrah forest determines amphibian populations, with several species existing at the eastern or western limits of their range. Herpetofauna includes the western marsh frog (or golden flecked burrowing frog, Heleioporus barycragus) which is generally restricted to the western Darling Range. There are at least 98 species of <b>bird</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woodland, including the almost flightless malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata).|$|E
5|$|Among Auerbach's accomplishments {{during his}} 20-year {{professional}} coaching career were eleven Eastern Division titles (including nine {{in a row}} from 1957–65), 11 appearances in the finals (including ten in a row from 1957–66), and nine NBA championships. With a total of 16 NBA championship rings in a span of 29 years (1957–86) as the Celtics coach, general manager, and team president, Auerbach is the most successful team official in NBA history. He is credited with creating several generations of championship Boston Celtics teams, including the first Celtics dynasty with Bill Russell, which won an NBA record eight titles in a row (1959–66). As Celtics general manager, he created championship-winning teams around Hall-of-Famers Dave Cowens in the 1970s and Larry <b>Bird</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s.|$|E
