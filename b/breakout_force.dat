40|$|The paper {{presents}} a {{finite element analysis}} of the force required to lift objects embedded in cohesive seafloor sediments. The behavior of the soil is described by a broadly applicable time-dependent constitutive model for cohesive soils. The validity of the numerical solution is evaluated by comparing the calculated <b>breakout</b> <b>force</b> with predictions obtained from some available empirical and analytical equations. In addition, the failure mechanism developed during the breakout of an embedded object is examined, and influence of soil characteristics, shear strength in particular, on {{the magnitude of the}} <b>breakout</b> <b>force</b> is investigated. The presented analyses demonstrate that the finite element solution for the <b>breakout</b> <b>force</b> is satisfactory and in a qualitative agreement with estimates from other methods. Therefore, the finite element method can provide a useful tool for studying the breakout phenomenon, and has a potentially broad realm of application that allows one to evaluate the effect of various factors on the magnitude of the <b>breakout</b> <b>force</b> required to free an embedded object. 1...|$|E

40|$|Background The force-feel system {{characteristics}} of the cyclic inceptors of most helicopters are set based on the {{characteristics of}} the mechanical components in the control system (mass, springs, friction dampers, etc.). For these helicopters, the force-feel characteristics typically remain constant over the entire flight envelope, with perhaps a trim release to minimize control forces while maneuvering. With the advent of fly-by-wire control systems and active inceptors in helicopters, the force-feel characteristics are now determined by the closed-loop response of the active inceptor itself as defined by the inertia, force/displacement gradient, damping, <b>breakout</b> <b>force</b> and detent shape configuration parameters in the inceptor control laws. These systems give the flexibility to dynamically prescribe different feel characteristics for different control modes or flight conditions, and the ability to provide tactile cueing to the pilot through the actively controlled side-stick or center-stick cyclic inceptor. For rotorcraft, a few studies have been conducted to assess the effects of cyclic force-feel characteristics on handling qualities in flight. An early study provided valuable insight into the static force-deflection characteristics (force gradient) and the number of axes controlled by the side-stic...|$|E
40|$|A {{handling}} qualities analysis has been performed on two unique side stick controllers in a fixed-base F- 18 flight simulator. Each stick, {{which uses a}} larger range of motion than is common for similar controllers, has a moving elbow cup that accommodates movement of the entire arm for control. The sticks are compared to the standard center stick in several typical fighter aircraft tasks. Several trends are visible in the time histories, pilot ratings, and pilot comments. The aggressive pilots preferred the center stick, because the side sticks are underdamped, causing overshoots and oscillations when large motions are executed. The less aggressive pilots preferred the side sticks, because of the smooth motion and low <b>breakout</b> <b>forces.</b> The aggressive pilots collectively gave the worst ratings, probably because of increased sensitivity of the simulator (compared to the actual F- 18 aircraft), which can cause pilot-induced oscillations when aggressive inputs are made. Overall, the elbow cup is not a positive feature, because using the entire arm for control inhibits precision. Pilots had difficulty measuring their performance, particularly during the offset landing task, and tended to overestimate...|$|R

40|$|During 1989 a new six-degree-of-freedom (6 -DOF) active hand {{controller}} {{concept was}} designed and constructed based {{on the concept of}} a virtual pivot. This concept, labeled VPHC, was first demonstrated in a 1985 study and a patent was issued in 1990. Operator control input occurs via a force/torque sensor rigidly mounted to the handgrip. Sensed force/torque signals are used by microprocessors to generate motor drive control for each of six independently controlled motors mounted on the three-legged mechanism. The control microprocessor uses input biasing and rate-feedback motor controllers to generate the sensed feel of virtual springs and deadbands found in more conventional designs. An important advantage of this design is that the location of the virtual pivots, reflective forces and torques, <b>breakout</b> <b>force</b> levels, sensed spring rates, and operating modes, can be changed simply by changing the software.

40|$|A {{proof-of-concept}} hand controller {{for controlling}} lateral and longitudinal cyclic pitch, collective pitch and tail rotor thrust was developed. The {{purpose of the}} work was to address problems of operator fatigue, poor proprioceptive feedback and cross-coupling of axes associated with many four-axis controller designs. The present design {{is an attempt to}} reduce cross-coupling to a level that can be controlled with <b>breakout</b> <b>force,</b> rather than to eliminate it entirely. The cascaded design placed lateral and longitudinal cyclic in their normal configuration. Tail rotor thrust was placed atop the cyclic controller. A left/right twisting motion with the wrist made the control input. The axis of rotation was canted outboard (clockwise) to minimize cross-coupling with the cyclic pitch axis. The collective control was a twist grip, like a motorcycle throttle. Measurement of the amount of cross-coupling involved in pure, single-axis inputs showed cross coupling under 10 percent of full deflection for all axes. This small amount of cross-coupling could be further reduced with better damping and force gradient control. Fatigue was not found to be a problem, and proprioceptive feedback was adequate for all flight tasks executed...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{worldwide}} interest in the exploration, production and utilization programs for offshore oil, natural gas and other minerals. As a part of these efforts considerable interest has been directed {{in the last decade}} towards marine geotechnology. Adhesive resistance of ocean sediments is one of the important properties of marine soils which finds an application in ship salvage, refloating of exploratory platforms and relocation of marine installations such as pipelines, oil rigs, well-head manifolds, well linings and ice-soil interaction studies. [...] There is considerable research work reported in the literature about the adhesion and skin friction between terrestrial soils and construction materials. However, ocean floor soils differ from most terrestrial soils in their properties. Surficial ocean sediments are generally cohesive and highly underconsolidated, having very low shear strength with high liquidity index. Such soils have negligible angle of shear resistance. In the studies of interaction of such soils with embedded objects, only adhesion is of primary importance. Very little information is available at present about the adhesive resistance of these underconsolidated sediments. A closely related property is the base suction at the interface of the object base and soil, which is important in the breakout problem. [...] An attempt has been made in this investigation to study the adhesion and base suction during pull out tests in an artificially sedimented soil having properties comparable to those of ocean sediments. Laboratory tests were carried out to determine (a) the adhesion between the soil and objects of different surface roughness, (b) the suction at the base of prismatic objects of different base configurations during pull out, and (c) the total <b>breakout</b> <b>force</b> for fully embedded objects. [...] Only one type of soil was used in all the tests and the sample was prepared by mixing a pre-weighed dry soil in a known volume of water. [...] The adhesive resistance was found to depend on the surface roughness of the embedded objects {{as well as on the}} soil cohesion. Surface unevenness and physio-chemical action were two additional factors influencing adhesion, as observed in the tests on plexiglas and glass plate respectively. [...] Base suction for prismatic objects was found to be a function of the depth to breadth ration (D/B) of the object. It is higher for higher D/B values. Base configurations do not appear to have any significant influence on the base suction values. [...] A fairly good correlation was found between the <b>breakout</b> <b>force</b> determined from the experiments and that estimated analytically.

40|$|In {{aerospace}} positioning actuators, gear efficiencies of 85 % {{as well as}} <b>breakout</b> <b>forces</b> as high as 50 % of {{the stall}} load of the actuator are observed at very low temperature conditions. Due to the low efficiency and high loading, stiction in these actuators is common {{which can lead to}} limit cycles or problems with controlling the actuators. To be able to correctly predict and assess these effects using simulations, a complete actuator, including motor, inverter, load and controller is needed. This article presents an object based, numerically efficient gear contact in a planar environment with user-defined friction- and stiffness laws. The emphasis of the modeling is not a fully detailed contact model, but the description of a gear contact model which can be used for system simulations like complete aircraft electro-mechanical actuators including control surfaces. The presented model is suitable for complex gearing configurations (e. g. compound planetary gears). This is enabled by breaking down the transmission into the basic gear contacts. By adding masses and constraints from an existing component library, a complete transmission can be modeled. The generated model can be used for standalone simulations or can be used in multi-domain simulations like actuator modeling, in order to analyze the complete actuator model including parts such as drives, controllers and mechanical systems. The presented models have been validated using a gear test rig for a single stage spur gear...|$|R

40|$|The {{notion of}} {{airplane}} stability and control being {{a balancing act}} between stability and control has been around as long as aeronautics. The Wright brothers’ first successful flights were born of the debate, and were successful {{at least in part}} because they spent considerable time teaching themselves how to control their otherwise unstable airplane. This thesis covers four aspects of handling for large transport aircraft: large size and the accompanying low frequency dynamics, the way in which lifting surfaces and control system elements are modelled in flight dynamics analyses, the cockpit feel characteristics and details of how pilots interact with them, and the dynamic instability associated with Pilot Induced Oscillations. The dynamics associated with large transport aircraft are reviewed from the perspective of pilot-in-the-loop handling qualities, including the effects of relaxing static stability in pursuit of performance. Areas in which current design requirements are incomplete are highlighted. Issues with modelling of dynamic elements which are between the pilot’s fingers and the airplane response are illuminated and recommendations are made. Cockpit feel characteristics are examined in detail, in particular, the nonlinear elements of friction and <b>breakout</b> <b>forces.</b> Three piloted simulation experiments are described and the results reviewed. Each was very different in nature, and all were designed to evaluate linear and nonlinear elements of the cockpit feel characteristics from the pilot’s point of view. These included understanding the pilot’s ability to precisely control the manipulator itself, the pilot’s ability to command the flight path, and neuro-muscular modelling to gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} range of characteristics pilots can adapt to and why. Based on the data collected and analyzed, conclusions are drawn and recommendations are made. Finally, a novel and unique PIO prediction criterion is developed, which is based on control-theoretic constructs.

The inceptor characteristics are typically based on a second order spring mass damper system with damping, force gradient, <b>breakout</b> <b>force,</b> and natural frequency parameters. Changing these parameters can have a great effect on pilot control of the vehicle. A quasi transfer of training experiment was performed employing a high fidelity and a low fidelity control inceptor. A disturbance compensatory task was employed which involved a simple horizon line disturbed in roll by a sum of sinusoids presented in an out-the-window display.

40|$|The {{excavator}} working {{device is}} a typical mechanical system of electromechanical liquid that is complex. Traditional optimization design methods are difficult to get global optimized results of excavator backhoe device through the serial mode of “mechanism-load-structure”. Thus, the theory of parallel collaborative optimization (CO) is applied. To establish a sophisticated CO model of the backhoe device, a certain excavator is investigated as a sample multidisciplinary CO (MDCO) design. To generate the CO model, an improved optimization algorithm called the particle swarm-genetic algorithm （PS-GA）is proposed. To verify the MDCO design of the excavator backhoe device, a parameterized virtual prototype (VP) of the backhoe device is established in ADAMS. This VP is optimized by applying the MDCO design results to the parameterized VP. The VP of the backhoe device is also optimized by a single discipline when the optimization results from a single discipline are inputted into the parameterized VP. Both optimized VPs are simulated under similar conditions, and results show that in the MDCO design, the arm crowd force of the backhoe device is 8. 1 % stronger than that in the design optimized by a single discipline under constant power and oil pressure conditions. Similarly, <b>breakout</b> <b>force</b> increased by approximately 8. 3 %.

40|$|Liquid Avonex® (Interferon beta- 1 a) {{manufactured}} by Biogen, Inc. is indicated {{for the treatment}} of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) to slow the accumulation of physical disability and decrease the frequency of clinical exacerbations. The recommended dosage of A vonex® {{for the treatment of}} relapsing forms of MS is 30 μg injected intramuscularly once a week. Several complications have been reported following intramuscular (IM) injections, of which pain at the injection site is the most common. Though factors such as site of injection, injection volume, concentration and nature of the drug may affect the reception of pain, one factor which has not apparently been given any attention in the published literature is the ease of injectability of the syringe, which is the amount of force required to expel the drug from the syringe. This factor can be expected to have a substantial effect on the discomfort experienced by patients and on the completeness of the injection (i. e. the percentage of dose delivered). An evaluation of the published literature by the author of this thesis has failed to reveal any publications dealing with the role of injectability as a measure for easing the pain on injection. There is a need for some objective, quantitative method for measuring the ease of injectability such as may be provided by use of the Instron Series 5500. The {{purpose of this study was}} to perform compressive studies on the intramuscular injection, Liquid Avonex® staked and luer-slip pre-filled syringes using the Instron Series 5500. The Instrument generates an expulsion force profile from which the force required for the initial movement of the plunger into the syringe (<b>breakout</b> <b>force)</b> was calculated. An ideal syringe with good ease of injectability will have minimum <b>breakout</b> <b>force</b> and a smooth expulsion profile. Thus by studying the various factors affecting the expulsion force profile, the ease of injectability of syringes was quantified. The various factors studied were age and viscosity of silicone oil, storage temperature, addition of surfactant and the speed of expulsion. The viscosity of the silicone oil and the method of siliconization were found to be critical factors defining the expulsion force profile. The 1000 cSt silicone oil was found to give better ease of injectability than the 12, 500 cSt silicone oil. Increase of storage temperature, addition of surfactant and increase of expulsion speed did not have any substantial effect on the expulsion force profile of the syringe. Pain on IM injection is also related to the mechanical properties of the needle insertion, which include the maximum force required to penetrate the muscle and the penetration profile of the needle into the muscle. Needle penetration studies were conducted to examine the injection profiles of staked and non-staked needle sharps using a model intramuscular injection pad. The results showed that nonstaked needles need lesser penetration force and show linear penetration profile in comparison with staked needles and hence cause less pain on injection. In conclusion, the results reported in this study clearly indicate that compressive studies using the Instron Series 5500 are an effective and convenient way to quantify the ease of injectability of syringes...|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} a fixed-base {{simulator}} study {{of the effects of}} variable longitudinal control-system dynamics on pilot opinion are presented and compared with flight-test data. The control-system variables considered in this investigation included stick force per g, time constant, and dead-band, or stabilizer <b>breakout</b> <b>force.</b> In general, the fairly good correlation between flight and simulator results for two pilots demonstrates the validity of fixed-base simulator studies which are designed to complement and supplement flight studies and serve as a guide in control-system preliminary design. However, in the investigation of certain problem areas (e. g., sensitive control-system configurations associated with pilot- induced oscillations in flight), fixed-base simulator results did not predict the occurrence of an instability, although the pilots noted the system was extremely sensitive and unsatisfactory. If it is desired to predict pilot-induced-oscillation tendencies, tests in moving-base simulators may be required. It was found possible to represent the human pilot by a linear pilot analog for the tracking task assumed in the present study. The criterion used to adjust the pilot analog was the root-mean-square tracking error of one of the human pilots on the fixed-base simulator. Matching the tracking error of the pilot analog to that of the human pilot gave an approximation to the variation of human-pilot behavior over a range of control-system dynamics. Results of the pilot-analog study indicated that both for optimized control-system dynamics (for poor airplane dynamics) and for a region of good airplane dynamics, the pilot response characteristics are approximately the same...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this master thesis {{is related to the}} passive suction under mud mats. Mud mats are used in the {{offshore}} industry to prevent structures from sinking in the soil after installation. If for some reason a structure has to be lifted, on the one side due to an installation error, on the other side due to removal the force needed to lift the structure sometimes exceeds the total submerged weight. This report contains a Literature survey conducted regarding the above subjects. This report also shows the design of a test setup and procedure for lifting a plate from a sand bed. In the end the report follows the modelling of an analytical model which is validated using the test data The focus of this report lies with finding out what basic parameters dominate this force and what the influence of these parameters are during lifting is sand. Experiments will be conducted to test these parameters. In the end these parameters will be used to develop a simple analytical model to predict the order of the <b>breakout</b> <b>force.</b> The model will then be validated with the experiments. The main research question is: How are the <b>breakout</b> <b>force</b> and breakout time influenced by the permeability of the sand and the lifting force? Can an analytical model, that uses these parameters, predicts the lifting force within a certain margin? Literature states that no breakout forces are to be expected due to the large permeability of sand but from cutting theories it is known that under pressures exist around the blade tip, especially for the smaller grain sizes. A test setup was built to study the lifting process and measure the pressure under the plate and his displacement for a given load. The tests were performed in two different sands (Silverbond and Geba Weiss) for a range of different loads with two different plates: A 2 -Dimensional setup and a 3 -Dimensional setup. An analytical model was created to predict the lifting force for a given permeability and upward velocity of the plate. In the end the model was validated with the test data. The test data showed that for the 2 -Dimensional case the pressure profile was of a rectangular shape. A factor 10 in breakout time between the sands can be observed. The 2 -Dimensional model gives a good estimation of the lifting load in Silverbond sand when using velocities {{from the beginning of the}} lifting process. For the Geba sand, after adjusting the length of the flow paths, the model also gives a good fit. The experiments with the 3 -Dimensional plate showed that the pressure profile under the plate is of a rectangular shape with steep slopes towards the edge of the plate. Nothing can be concluded about a relation between the breakout time and the permeability for the same load between the two different sands due to an inertia dominated process. The 3 -Dimensional model predict the lifting force accurately for the Silverbond sand using the velocities from the beginning of the lifting process. For the Geba sand the permeability had to be scaled to give a good fit. This is because of model assumptions and using flow paths. Adjusting the tune factor did not give satisfactory results.

That is, the effects of static pedal force at maximum pedal travel, <b>breakout</b> <b>force,</b> and maximum pedal travel on handling qualities were studied. An artificial maneuver with a severe lateral wind shear and requiring runway tracking {{at an altitude of}} 50 feet in a crosswind was used to fully exercise the rudder pedals. Twelve active airline pilots voluntarily participated in the study and flew approximately 500 maneuvers. The pilots rated the maneuver performance with various rudder pedal feel characteristics using the Cooper- Harper rating scale. The test matrix had 15 unique combinations of the 3 static pedal feel characteristics. A 10 -term, second-order equation for the Cooper-Harper pilot rating {{as a function of the}} 3 independent pedal feel parameters was fit to the data. The test matrix utilized a Central Composite Design that is very efficient for fitting an equation of this form. The equation was used to produce contour plots of constant pilot ratings as a function of two of the parameters with the third parameter held constant. These contour plots showed regions of good handling qualities as well as regions of degraded handling qualities. In addition, a numerical equation solver was used to predict the optimum parameter values (those with the lowest pilot rating). Quantitative pilot performance data were also analyzed. This analysis found that the peak values of the cross power spectra of the pedal force and heading angle could be used to quantify the tendency toward directional pilot induced oscillations (PIO). Larger peak values of the cross power spectra were correlated with larger (degraded) Cooper-Harper pilot ratings.

40|$|The control {{inceptor}} used in {{a simulated}} vehicle {{is an important part}} in maintaining the fidelity of a simulation. The force feedback provided by the control inceptor gives the operator important cues to maintain adequate performance. The dynamics of a control inceptor are typically based on a second order spring mass damper system with damping, force gradient, <b>breakout</b> <b>force,</b> and natural frequency parameters. Changing these parameters can have a great effect on pilot or driver control of the vehicle. The neuromuscular system has a very important role in manipulating the control inceptor within a vehicle. Many studies by McRuer, Aponso, and Hess have dealt with modeling the neuromuscular system and quantifying the effects of a high fidelity control loader as compared to a low fidelity control loader. Humans are adaptive in nature and their control behavior changes based on different control loader dynamics. Humans will change their control behavior to maintain tracking bandwidth and minimize tracking error. This paper reports on a quasi-transfer of training experiment which was performed at the NASA Langley Research Center. The quasi transfer of training study used a high fidelity control loader and a low fidelity control loader. Subjects trained in both simulations and then were transferred to the high fidelity control loader simulation. The parameters for the high fidelity control loader were determined from the literature. The low fidelity control loader parameters were found through testing of a simple computer joystick. A disturbance compensatory task is employed. The compensatory task involves implementing a simple horizon out the window display. A disturbance consisting of a sum of sines is used. The task consists of the subject compensating for the disturbance on the roll angle of the aircraft. The vehicle dynamics are represented as 1 /s and 1 /s 2. The subject will try to maintain level flight throughout the experiment. The subjects consist of non-pilots to remove any effects of pilot experience. First, this paper discusses the implementation of the disturbance compensation task. Second, the high and low fidelity parameters used within the experiment are presented. Finally, an explanation of results from the experiments is presented...|$|E
40|$|The force-feel system {{characteristics}} of the cyclic inceptors of most helicopters are set based on the {{characteristics of}} the mechanical components in the control system (mass, springs, friction dampers, etc.). For these helicopters, the force-feel characteristics typically remain constant over the entire flight envelope, with perhaps a trim release to minimize control forces while maneuvering. With the advent of fly-by-wire control systems and active inceptors in helicopters, the force-feel characteristics are now determined by the closed-loop response of the active inceptor itself as defined by the inertia, force/displacement gradient, damping, <b>breakout</b> <b>force</b> and detent shape configuration parameters in the inceptor control laws. These systems give the flexibility to dynamically prescribe different feel characteristics for different control modes or flight conditions, and the ability to provide tactile cueing to the pilot through the actively controlled side-stick or center-stick cyclic inceptor. For rotorcraft, a few studies have been conducted to assess the effects of cyclic force-feel characteristics on handling qualities in flight. An early study provided valuable insight into the static force-deflection characteristics (force gradient) and the number of axes controlled by the side-stick controller for the U. S. Army's Advanced Digital/Optical Control System (ADOCS) demonstrator aircraft [1]. The {{first of a series of}} studies providing insight on the inceptor dynamic force-feel characteristics was conducted on the NASA/Army CH- 47 B variable-stability helicopter [2]. This work led to a proposed requirement that set boundaries based on the cyclic natural frequency and inertia, with the stipulation of a lower damping ratio limit of 0. 3 [3]. A second study was conducted by the Canadian Institute for Aerospace Research using their variable-stability Bell 205 A helicopter [4]. This research suggested boundaries for stick dynamics based on natural frequency and damping ratio. While these two studies produced boundaries for acceptable/unacceptable stick dynamics for rotorcraft, they were not able to provide guidance on how variations of the stick dynamics in the acceptable region impact handling qualities. More recently, a ground based simulation study [5] suggested little benefit was to be obtained from variations of the damping ratio for a side-stick controller exhibiting high natural frequencies (greater than 17 rad/s) and damping ratios (greater than 2. 0). A flight test campaign was conducted concurrently on the RASCAL JUH- 60 A in-flight simulator and the ACT/FHS EC- 135 in flight simulator [6]. Upon detailed analysis of the pilot evaluations the study identified a clear preference for a high damping ratio and natural frequency of the center stick inceptors. Side stick controllers were found to be less sensitive to the damping. While these studies have compiled a substantial amount of data, in the form of qualitative and quantitative pilot opinion, a fundamental analysis of the effect of the inceptor force-feel system on flight control is found to be lacking. The study of Ref. [6] specifically concluded that a systematic analysis was necessary, since discrepancies with the assigned handling qualities showed that proposed analytical design metrics, or criteria, were not suitable. The overall goal of the present study is to develop a clearer fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with the inceptor dynamics that govern the handling qualities using a manageable analytical methodology...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Brownian bridge movement model (BBMM) models target movement between two known points as a Brownian bridge. This thesis extended the BBMM {{to account for}} multiple starting and ending points and to account for intelligence inputs midway through the target movement. The BBMM is applied to a military scenario where U. S. forces are conducting surveillance to monitor the <b>breakout</b> of Chinese <b>forces</b> in the South China Sea. Probability heat maps, depicting {{the probability of a}} target location at discrete times, are generated through simulations in MATLAB. Using the heat maps, this thesis developed an algorithm to automate the placement of sensors to detect the target. This thesis focused on the use of a network of unmanned sensors as the means for target detection. The relationship between the sensors' attributes and the probability of detection is explored through a meta-experiment. The experiment utilizes a three-stage algorithm that generates heat maps, deploys sensors and randomizes intelligence inputs, and measures the probability of detection. A trade-off analysis was conducted and showed that to achieve a higher probability of detection, it is more effective to have sensors cover a wider area at fewer discrete points in time than to have a greater number of discrete looks using sensors covering smaller areas.

When full-scale war broke out between China and Japan in 1937, Sun led his 88th Division in the Battle of Shanghai. He personally gave the order to regimental commander Xie Jinyuan {{to hold onto the}} Sihang Warehouse {{at the conclusion of the}} three-month battle.During the Battle of Nanking in December 1937, he and his troops were surrounded by nearly a quarter million Japanese troops. Sun's superior, Tang Shengzhi, fled the city without giving his commanders any clear instructions on a possible <b>breakout.</b> Sun was <b>forced</b> to abandon his post during the ensuing chaos and escape from Nanking. Chiang Kai-shek reluctantly suspended him for two month and Sun did not receive another command until 1939. In 1944, the Imperial Japanese Army under Hata Shunroku launched Operation Ichigo, the largest military offensive against the nationalist government since the Battle of Wuhan, most of China's best troops were in Yunnan and Burma, and over half million Japanese soldiers attacked major railroad links and large cities, and the vanguard of the Japanese Eleventh Army were only 150 miles from Chungking itself. Chiang Kai-shek dispatched nine hundred men of Sun's 29th corps to the south of Chungking and they drove away the two regiments of the Japanese 3rd Infantry Division despite complete numerical and technological inferiority. Sun was promoted to General and commander of the 16th army. Chiang personally bestowed the Order of Blue Sky and White Sun upon him.|$|R
