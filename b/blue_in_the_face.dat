5|$|In 1990, Madonna starred as Breathless Mahoney in Dick Tracy, {{directed}} by Warren Beatty {{and based on}} Chester Gould's comic strip. She received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Actress. Beatty later appeared in her 1991 documentary, , which showed {{behind the scenes of}} her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour. It was the highest-grossing documentary of all time at that point. She also received positive reviews for her role in A League of Their Own (1992), which was centered on a women's baseball team during World War II. In 1993, Madonna starred in the erotic thriller Body of Evidence, which performed poorly at the box office. Her subsequent films saw Madonna take on smaller roles, including a singing telegram girl in <b>Blue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Face</b> (1995), a witch in Four Rooms (1995), and a phone sex company owner in Spike Lee's Girl 6 (1996). Madonna starred as Eva Perón in the 1996 film adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Evita. Her performance was acclaimed by critics and won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.|$|E

The {{newspaper}} Svenska Dagbladet reported the woman went into convulsions and turned <b>blue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> Doctors reported she was comatose and suffering from hyponatremia and severe hypokalemia; the woman died {{one and a}} half days after the onset of symptoms. An autopsy showed severe brain swelling. Mephedrone was scheduled to be classified as a [...] "dangerous substance" [...] in Sweden even before the woman's death at Karolinska University Hospital on 14 December, but the death brought more media attention to the drug. The possession of mephedrone became classified as a criminal offence in Sweden on 15 December 2008.|$|E

[...] Behar said promotion [...] "will be on the superstar scale" [...] and [...] " [...] didn't put this marketing campaign behind it because there was a tragedy. We put this marketing campaign behind it because we believed {{that this was going to}} be a huge album because of the music. This is a record that we're going to work over the next 10 months." [...] EMI Records and EMI Latin put aside [...] ($784,000 2015 USD) to complete Dreaming of You. [...] "Oh No (I'll Never Fall in Love Again)", a song intended to be recorded for Dreaming of You, was released on the SelenaQRadio (a free radio operated by Quintanilla, Jr.) in September 2015. Quintanilla, Jr. decided to release the demo version of the song after fans began requesting for it to be heard.|$|E

2500|$|William B. Bankhead {{was devastated}} by his wife's death, which sent {{him into a}} bout of {{depression}} and alcoholism. Consequently, Tallulah and her sister Eugenia were mostly reared by their paternal grandmother, Tallulah James Brockman Bankhead, at the family estate called [...] "Sunset" [...] in Jasper, Alabama. As a child, Bankhead was described as [...] "extremely homely" [...] and overweight, while her sister was slim and prettier. As a result, she did everything in her efforts to gain attention, and constantly sought her father's approval. After watching a performance at a circus, she taught herself how to cartwheel, and frequently cartwheeled about the house, sang, and recited literature that she had memorized. She was prone to throwing tantrums, rolling around the floor, and holding her breath until she was visibly <b>blue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> Her grandmother often threw {{a bucket of water}} on her to halt these outbursts.|$|E
6000|$|All {{sorts of}} diversions were going on. Monkeys, organs, girls on stilts, a conjurer, and {{a troop of}} negro minstrels, were all at work to amuse the visitors. I thought the varied color and bustling {{enjoyment}} of the crowd, with the bright blue sea beyond, and the glorious sunshine overhead, quite delightful--I declare I felt as if two eyes were not half enough to see with! A nice old lady, sitting near, entered into conversation with me; hospitably offering me biscuits and sherry out of her own bag. Oscar, to my disappointment, looked quite disgusted with all of us. He thought my nice old lady vulgar; and he called the company on the beach [...] "a herd of snobs." [...] While he was still muttering under his breath about the [...] "mixture of low people," [...] he suddenly cast a side-look at some person or thing--I could not at the moment tell which--and, rising, placed himself so as to intercept my view of the promenade on the sands immediately before me. I happened to have noticed, at the same moment, a lady approaching us in a dress of a peculiar color; and I pulled Oscar on one side, {{to look at her}} as she passed in front of me. [...] "Why do you get in my way?" [...] I asked. Before he could answer the question the lady passed, with two lovely children, and with a tall man at her side. My eyes, looking first at the lady and the children, found their way next to the gentleman--and saw repeated <b>in</b> his <b>face,</b> <b>the</b> same black-blue complexion which had startled me <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of Oscar's brother, when I first opened my eyes at the rectory! For the moment I felt startled again--more, as I believe, by the unexpected repetition of <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of a stranger, than by the ugliness of the complexion itself. At any rate, I was composed enough to admire the lady's dress, and the beauty of the children, before they had passed beyond my range of view. Oscar spoke to me, while I was looking at them, in a tone of reproach for which, as I thought, there was no occasion and no excuse.|$|R

2500|$|The British writer Peter Fleming visited Manchukuo in 1935, {{and while}} riding a train through the {{countryside}} of Manchukuo, a group of Japanese colonists mistook his Swiss girlfriend Kini for a Russian refugee, and began to beat her up. It was only after Fleming was able {{to prove to the}} Japanese that his girlfriend was Swiss, not Russian, that the Japanese stopped and apologized, saying that they would never had beaten her up if they had known she was Swiss, saying that they sincerely believed she was a Russian when they assaulted her. Fleming observed that in Manchukuo: [...] "you can beat White Russians up till you are <b>blue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> because they are people without status in the world, citizens of nowhere". Fleming further noted that the Japanese in Manchukuo had a strong dislike of all white people, and because the Russians in Manchukuo were stateless without an embassy to issue protests if they were victimized, the Japanese liked to victimize them. Until World War II, the Japanese tended to leave alone those travelling to Manchukuo with a passport as they did not like to deal with protests from embassies in Tokyo about the mistreatment of their citizens. The Kwantung Army operated a secret biological-chemical warfare unit based in Pinfang, Unit 731, that performed gruesome experiments on people involving much visceration of the subjects to see the effects of chemicals and germs on the human body. In the late 1930s, the doctors of Unit 731 demanded more white subjects to experiment upon in order to test the efficiency the strains of anthrax and plague that they were developing leading to a great many of the Russians living in Manchukuo becoming the unwilling human guinea pigs of Unit 731. The Russian Fascist Party, which worked with the Japanese was used to kidnap various [...] "unreliable" [...] Russians living in Manchukuo for Unit 731 to experiment upon.|$|E

60|$|MY DEAR BAXTER, - By {{the date}} you may perhaps {{understand}} the purport of my letter without any words wasted about the matter. I cannot walk with you to-morrow, {{and you must}} not expect me. I came yesterday afternoon to Bridge of Allan, and have been very happy ever since, as every place is sanctified by the eighth sense, Memory. I walked up here this morning (three miles, TU-DIEU! a good stretch for me), and passed one of my favourite places in the world, and one that I very much affect in spirit when the body is tied down and brought immovably to anchor on a sickbed. It is a meadow and bank on a corner on the river, and is connected in my mind inseparably with Virgil's ECLOGUES. HIC CORULIS MISTOS INTER CONSEDIMUS ULMOS, or something very like that, the passage begins (only I know my short-winded Latinity must have come to grief over even this much of quotation); and here, to a wish, is just such a cavern as Menalcas might shelter himself withal from the bright noon, and, with his lips curled backward, pipe himself <b>blue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> while MESSIEURS LES ARCADIENS would roll out those cloying hexameters that sing themselves in one's mouth to such a curious lifting chant.|$|E

She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess. Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann's pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all {{because she had a}} lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn't like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn't eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap's lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery's summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses. He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.|$|E
