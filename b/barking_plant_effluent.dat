40|$|Conservation {{of water}} in {{bleached}} kraft pulp mills by recycling the bleach <b>plant</b> <b>effluent</b> directly without treatment will cause accumulation of inorganic ''non-process elements'' (NPEs) and serious operational problems. In this work, an electrodialysis process is being developed for recycling the acidic bleach <b>plant</b> <b>effluent</b> of bleached kraft pulp mills. In this process, electrodialysis functions as a selective kidney to remove inorganic NPEs from bleach <b>plant</b> <b>effluents,</b> {{before they reach the}} recovery cycle. Acidic bleach <b>plant</b> <b>effluents</b> from several mills using bleaching sequences based on chlorine dioxide were characterized. The total dissolved solids were mostly inorganic NPEs. Sodium was the predominant cation and chloride was present at significant levels in all these effluents. In laboratory electrodialysis experiments, selective removal of chloride and potentially harmful cations, such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium, were removed efficiently. Rejection of organic compounds was up to 98 %. Electrodialysis was shown to be resistant to membrane fouling and scaling, in a 100 -hour laboratory experiment. Based on a model mill with 1, 000 ton/day pulp production, the economic analysis suggests that the energy cost of electrodialysis is less than $ 200 /day, and the capital cost of the stack is about $ 500, 000...|$|R

40|$|As {{part of an}} {{experimental}} project on the treatment of bleach <b>plant</b> <b>effluents</b> the results of biodegradability and toxicity assessment of effluents from a bench-scale horizontal anaerobic immobilized bioreactor (HAIB) are discussed in this paper. The biodegradability of the bleach <b>plant</b> <b>effluents</b> from a Kraft pulp mill treated in the HAIB was evaluated using the modified Zahn-Wellens test. The inoculum came from a pulp mill wastewater treatment plant and the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) {{was used as the}} indicator of organic matter removal. The acute and chronic toxicity removal during the anaerobic treatment was estimated using Daphnia similis and Ceriodaphnia silvestrii respectively. Moreover, the evaluation of chromosome aberrations (CA), micronucleus frequencies (MN) and mitotic index (IM) in Allium cepa cells were used as genotoxicity indicators. The results indicate that the effluents from the anaerobic reactor are amenable to aerobic polishing. Acute and chronic toxicity were reduced by 90 and 81 %, respectively. The largest CA and MN incidence in the meristematic cells of A. cepa were observed after exposure to the raw bleach <b>plant</b> <b>effluent.</b> The HAIB was able to reduce the acute and chronic toxicity as well as chromosome aberrations and the occurrence of micronucleus.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to reuse of sewage {{treatment}} <b>plants</b> <b>effluent</b> and domestic wastewater as a sustainable water supply to landscape irrigation using drip irrigation. Generally, reuse of freshwater consumption is devoted to agricultural activities that caused critical water demand. Wastewater reuse can provide an alternative solution to these problems by supplying the water and nutrients needed for landscape irrigation. Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium are the major, nutrients for plant growth, thus, the sewage treatment <b>plants</b> <b>effluent</b> and domestic wastewater are sustainable to be used as an alternative water supply for landscape irrigation as all of these nutrients can also be found in these two alternatives. However, the safe use of wastewater for irrigation purpose should be determined. Therefore, a test was done in environmental laboratory in order to test the water quality of sewage treatment <b>plant</b> <b>effluent,</b> domestic wastewater and tap water. Besides, this study also was done to determine the effectiveness of using these types of wastewater in contributing in the plant growth. In an effort to test it effectiveness, the wastewater was irrigated to three gardens which were planted with the same types of plant in the same quantity where garden A was irrigated with tap water, garden B irrigated with domestic wastewater while garden C was irrigated with sewage treatment <b>plant</b> <b>effluent.</b> The <b>plants</b> used in this study are 'Corrilair Yellow', 'Ixora', 'Licuala Grandis', Loropetalum' and 'Spider Lily' which are measured based on their overall height, canopy opening, leaves size and leaves height. The drip irrigation was used to irrigate the water supply to each garden as it is the most effective way to reduce water consumption and the pollutants that will be produced. Sewage treatment plants, domestic wastewater and tap water are safe to be used for landscape irrigation based on the results shown by the growths of the plant.

40|$|In {{a limited}} screen of monokaryons and dikaryons of various strains of Trametes versicolor, the monokaryons {{generally}} bleached hardwood and softwood kraft pulps more extensively than dikaryons, {{although there was}} great variation among both groups. A monokaryotic strain (52 J) derived from a Paprican dikaryon (52 P) by regenerating mycelium-derived protoplasts had better pulp bleaching ability than its dikaryotic parent. Unusually low extracellular laccase and manganese peroxidase activity levels were associated with reduced pulp bleaching. Mutants of strain 52 J were isolated with various manganese peroxidase and laccase activities.
