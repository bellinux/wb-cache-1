500|$|Sadie's Story {{was created}} by Fourth Wall Studios in {{partnership}} with Staten and artist Ashley Wood. Fourth Wall Studios was formed by former members of 42 Entertainment, who produced the highly successful I Love Bees alternate reality game to promote Halo 2. Recalled Staten, [...] "we realized that in Halo we do {{a pretty good job}} of describing the clash of these military industrial complexes, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> the soldiers' story," [...] and Halo 3: ODST offered a chance to take a look at the unexplored civilian story.|$|E
500|$|Author of the 1985 book Fresh: Hip Hop Don't Stop, writer Nelson George further {{elaborated}} on {{the appeal}} of Radio to listeners at the time, describing LL Cool J as a [...] "minimalist homeboy who knows his beats", and stating [...] "You can call it rap, hip hop or street, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> a way of hearing music—and partying hard—that expresses the experiences and attitudes of a great many inner city kids. L.L. Cool J {{is one of the}} best young talkologists around, because he speaks directly to and about his generation over large beats that recall Run-D.M.C., Trouble Funk, James Brown, and funky little bits of AC/DC and Yes ... This teenage music is built around beats, but not just any old beats. It is all about a beat with style, with personality, and L.L. Cool J has plenty of both." ...|$|E
500|$|This was {{the last}} episode filmed by Carter to feature Scully in the FBI autopsy scene at 20th Century Fox. The {{different}} numbers seen in this scene was used to [...] "conceit, this idea that numerology {{is an important part}} of our life and plays a part, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> just used here to illustrate the idea of patterns, patterns of behavior, of the ways in which numbers rule both the universe and our lives and our ability to solve things, to solve our mysteries of life, to solve these cases, which will lead them, as we'll see as the act comes to a close here, they are both [...] believers of the numerological episode." [...] The tagline for this episode is [...] "Dio Ti Ama", meaning [...] "God loves you" [...] in Italian, replacing the usual phrase [...] "The Truth is Out There." [...] The normal line [...] "Executive Producer: Chris Carter" [...] is also rendered in Italian, reading, [...] "Produttore Esecutivo: Chris Carter".|$|E
5000|$|Charnley's biographer, James Kirkwood, said: [...] "It may <b>be</b> a cliché, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> true of Dave {{that you}} never heard anybody say a bad word about him." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{reconstruction}} was an improvement, {{seen from}} most angles. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> an insufficient action, {{partly due to}} the very low terraces behind the goals but mainly due to the complete lack of roofs and other weather shields at the three terraced sides. And from now on was the maximum capacity reduced to around 11.000.|$|R
60|$|Evelyn {{seemed to}} {{intimate}} that perhaps ten {{was the right}} figure, <b>but</b> that <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> not a high one.|$|R
500|$|In the UK, BBC DJ John Peel called [...] "Ding Dong" [...] "repetitive and dull" [...] {{and accused}} Harrison of complacency, while the NMEs Bob Woffinden derided Dark Horse as [...] "Just stuff and nonsense", adding: [...] "You keep looking for saving graces, for words of enthusiasm {{to pass on}} – 'Ding Dong', you begin to think, for all its inane lyrics, has some spirit, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> very slight." [...] Harrison's {{standing}} there was not helped {{by the presence of}} [...] "I Don't Care Anymore" [...] on the B-side, due to its casual delivery and the literal message in the song title. In a more favourable review, for Melody Maker, Chris Irwin wrote of the single: [...] "We’ve come to expect something with more substance than this glorified nursery rhyme from {{one of the most important}} musicians of the decade. True, it’s catchy with a full chunky sound to bounce it along, but with an undeniable infectiousness of the sort normally associated with chicken pox or measles ... Curiously, records of such banality have a habit of selling in their zillions and this is bound to be a biggie. Hit." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Dyer's casting in {{the series}} was announced, Daniel Kilkelly from {{entertainment}} website Digital Spy expected reactions to be mixed, as comments made by the website's readers about Dyer {{in the past have}} included both praise and derision, and felt the announcement would spark debate. Kilkelly felt positive about the casting, saying: [...] "Dyer has a strong screen presence {{which is going to be}} crucial when it comes to taking over such an important role in EastEnders. Recent new characters to join the show have seemed to stay on the sidelines with no clear direction, while the plan for Mick is for him to join the Square and take on his new job straight away. Dyer should definitely be up to the task of hitting the ground running." [...] He was relieved that Dyer would not be playing another hardman character, saying that [...] "it should be interesting to see how he rises to the challenge." [...] However, he opined that casting a well-known actor who divides opinions could be a risk, as fans of the show may see Dyer, rather than his character, moving into the show, and hoped that the actor's profile would not lead to him leaving the series after only a short stint. Alex Fletcher from the site said, [...] "Danny Dyer. In EastEnders. The two things together still don't quite seem believable, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> happening", and predicted he would be [...] "awesome".|$|E
6000|$|... "So you might; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> {{too late}} to disturb that good lady, and the evening is much too cold {{for her to come}} out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{it is easy}} to see that," [...] said Arthur, laughing, and {{pointing}} to Aleck, who, indeed, was in lamentable case, having one eye entirely closed, a large strip of plaster on his head, and all the rest of his body more or less marked with bites. [...] "It is an uncommonly awkward business for me, and your cousin will not forgive it in a hurry, I fancy; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> not poor Aleck's fault--he is gentle as a lamb, if only he is let alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But wait. The {{matter is}} not yet finished. I think you are mistaken about your duty being ended; <b>but</b> if <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is,</b> I myself {{have a duty to}} perform yet.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{director}} {{had this}} say {{about how the}} initial casting went: [...] "I know this sounds funny, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> {{one of those things}} that magically came to fruition. My agent knew Adam Pally, who was on our wish list for the role of Kevin. She sent him the script, and within days he came on board. He then suggested Rosa whom he worked on the film Search Party and a similar thing happened. <b>It</b> <b>really</b> worked out - I think Adam’s comedic flair brought the best out of Rosa’s more dramatic background." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm awfully sorry, gentlemen; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> not my fault. You see the {{position}} I'm in. Don't blame me. Don't {{make it worse}} for me to bear than it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Amy, {{the writing}} on this card is very {{like that in the}} big book. I may be bewitched by this mid-summer moonlight, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> very like it. Come and see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does seem}} extraordinary, Lady Moulton, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> not so, and I hope to {{convince}} you that I am right by producing Walter in a week from the present time." ...|$|E
60|$|I tore out the sheet, folded, {{addressed}} it {{and presented}} it to Goza, remarking that although it seemed to <b>be</b> <b>but</b> paper, <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> fourteen blankets--if given at once to Nombe.|$|R
50|$|This {{is a town}} {{which grew}} out of the {{industrial}} revolution, The commune was created in 1846, carved out of the communes de Laval, Portes, Sainte-Cécile-d'Andorge, and Les Salles-du-Gardon. It became the seat of the canton 12 years later in 1858. During the Middle Ages, the valley was one of the cradles of the Cevennes coal industry, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> not until around 1780 on the initiative of Pierre-François Tubeuf that industrial mining techniques were used. Shafts were sunk, and the galleries were supported with wooden pit-props.|$|R
6000|$|... "There," [...] said he; [...] "now {{you have}} a heart that any man might be proud of. I'm sorry I had to put a patch on your breast, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> couldn't <b>be</b> helped." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{very sorry}} for you, Ulick,' said Albinia, 'and I hate to advise you to be selfish, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> quite {{impossible}} {{for you to be}} paymaster for all your brothers' debts.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Mother, dear, I'm sure he will," [...] and {{replaced}} the fillet. A patient, half-sad, half-quizzical smile visited Frances Freeland's lips, as who should say: 'Yes, I {{know you think}} that I'm a fuss-box, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> a pity that you wear it so, darling!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That was {{the right}} way for her to take it,' said Anne; 'but I still think Mrs. Staunton must be an {{excessively}} silly person. Of course one would wish to keep from hurting people's feelings, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> hardly possible to help it, if they will ride out to meet offence in such a way.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{it seems}} to me," [...] said Rollo, [...] "that the {{question}} is not what people call <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> what <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is.</b> The going of a steamboat is certainly not sailing, in any sense." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Ben Stillerreally {{taught me}} how to write a script. I don’t know that he ever {{explicitly}} said <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> by imagining the script as a verbal description of a movie, the movie that I wanted the book to be. That’s very simple, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> the key to everything for me—just imagining what was on the page. I was shortchanging the visual in my script, concentrating on dialogue, which I imagine is a very common first-time screenwriter’s mistake, and to suddenly just do it visually opened up everything for me." [...] —Smith on writing the screenplay.|$|R
5|$|The {{first two}} print runs used Thayer and Company lithographers, with one litho stone for {{the color and}} the other for {{printing}} black on the white paper stock. Because the paper of 1840's through 1890's included a lavish amount of fiber, often taken from mummy wrappings, it would not fade or decompose like the wood pulp paper used today. The first print run copied the Laurie and Whittles game. Laurie and Whittles used gold ink. Thayer mixed his ink to look gold <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> a goldish brown. Like Laurie and Whittles game, Thayer used an octagonal end space.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I won't {{argue that}} with you. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> a scandal that Tod's wife should incite her {{young people to}} stir up the villagers. Goodness knows where that mayn't lead! Tod's cottage and land, you see, are {{freehold}}, the only freehold thereabouts; and his being a brother of Stanley's makes it particularly awkward for the Mallorings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope, guardian," [...] said I, [...] "that you may {{not trust}} too much to my discretion. I hope {{you may not}} mistake me. I am afraid {{it will be a}} {{disappointment}} to you to know that I am not clever, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> the truth, and you would soon find it out if I had not the honesty to confess it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It wasn't ending it, I suppose? I say, {{when you}} began it, {{it was hard}} enough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette, except {{that he is not}} worthy of such a daughter, which is no {{imputation}} on him, for {{it was not to be}} expected that anybody should be, under any circumstances. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> doubly and trebly hard to have crowds and multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven him), to take Ladybird's affections away from me." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{then the}} Colonel, bestirring {{himself to the}} rescue, with 'go away boys, or I'll send for the police.' And then the discovery, when in {{the height of his}} wrath, Jock perked up, and said, 'I thought you would like to have the ladies amused, Uncle Robert.' He did box his ears then—-small blame to him, I must say. I could stand that better than the jaw Ellen gave us afterwards. I beg your pardon, Mary, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> one. She thinks us far gone in the ways of depravity, and doesn't willingly let her little girls come near us." ...|$|R
5000|$|Photographer Rob Galbraith, {{who also}} shot the Oka Crisis (for Reuters) {{believes}} the photo {{is among the}} top five Canadian photos ever taken. Galbraith insists that [...] "It’s the symbolism of it... This is the difference between a newswire photographer and a newspaper photographer. A news wire photographer tries to photograph an image that captivates and you don’t have to write a word for it, whereas a newspaper photographer will normally take photos that need a caption." [...] Photographer Bill Grimshaw (who developed the photo) feels differently, believing that the photo was [...] "a great photo for the day — <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> theatre and says nothing about anything." ...|$|R
50|$|Minnie and Moo go on a {{bus that}} they think is for a world tour, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> for the neighborhood.|$|R
6000|$|... "I met William Larkins," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Elton, [...] "as I got {{near the}} house, {{and he told}} me I should not find his master at home, but I did not believe him.--William seemed rather out of humour. He did not know what was come to his master lately, he said, but he could hardly ever get the speech of him. I {{have nothing to do with}} William's wants, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> of very great importance that I should see Knightley to-day; and it becomes a matter, therefore, of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well! {{if you do}} {{not like}} it, you must make your excuses to him; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> the pleasantest way of commencing your {{acquaintance}} at Court, and only allowed to distingués; among which, as you are the friend of the new Grand Marshal, you are of course considered. No one is petted so much as a political, apostate, except, perhaps, a religious one; so at present we are all in high feather. You had better dine at the palace to-day. Everything quite easy; and, by an agreeable relaxation of state, neither swords, bags, nor trains are necessary. Have you seen the palace? I suppose not. We will look at it, and then call on the Prince." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's what I want to know. It is so disheartening {{to have to}} {{remember}} such things. What {{does it matter if}} the hog HAS forty-two toes. And yet, if Mrs. Beeton knew it, one feels that one ought to know it also. If once I began to skip, there would be no end to it. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> such a splendid book in other ways. It doesn't matter what you want, you will find it here. Take the index anywhere. Cream. If you want cream, it's all there. Croup. If you want--I mean, if you don't want croup, it will teach you how not to get it. Crumpets--all about them. Crullers--I'm sure you don't know what a cruller is, Frank.' ...|$|E
60|$|Way {{down beside}} the Laughing Brook grew a little bush. It looked a whole lot like other little bushes all around <b>it.</b> <b>But</b> <b>really</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> quite different, as you shall see. When in the spring warm, jolly, round Mr. Sun brought back the birds and set them singing, when the little flowers popped their heads {{out of the ground}} to have a look around, then all the little bushes put out their green leaves.|$|R
50|$|The {{quality of}} the {{grinding}} of the diagonally grooved rollers were determined by the mechanical treatment of the notches, the number of notches, shape, inclination and position relative to each other. Mechwart {{with the use of}} this knowledge constructed the structure and improved it to a perfectly usable machine. His patented version became world-famous. The Ganz Works produced {{until the end of the}} 19th century about sixty different types of roller mills. For the modern Hungarian steam powered mills they manufactured Haggenmacher-printing machines and driving force, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> the roller mill which helped to bring the Hungarian milling industry the world-fame. The development of the factory is related closely to the production of the roller mill which pulled the company through the downturns of the financial crises.|$|R
