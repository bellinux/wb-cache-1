40|$|The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) {{launched}} the Minnesota <b>Bicycle</b> <b>and</b> Pedestrian Counting Initiative in 2011, a statewide, collaborative effort {{to encourage and}} support non-motorized traffic monitoring. This report summarizes work by MnDOT and the University of Minnesota between 2014 and 2016 to institutionalize <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> pedestrian monitoring. The project team established a new statewide <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> pedestrian traffic monitoring network with 25 permanent monitoring locations and a new district-based portable counting equipment loan program. Other key accomplishments included Minnesota’s first <b>Bicycle</b> <b>and</b> Pedestrian Annual Traffic Monitoring Report, a new MnDOT website for reporting annual and short-duration counts, <b>and</b> a new <b>Bicycle</b> <b>and</b> Pedestrian Data Collection Manual that local jurisdictions and consultants can use to design manual and automated non-motorized traffic monitoring programs. The project team also included provisions in MnDOT equipment vendor agreements that enable local governments to purchase <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> monitoring equipment; established new annual training programs for <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> pedestrian monitoring; and contributed provisions in the Statewide <b>Bicycle</b> System Plan <b>and</b> Minnesota Walks that call for <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> pedestrian traffic monitoring and creation of performance measures based on counts. Despite this progress, challenges in implementing monitoring remain and continued investment in <b>and</b> support for <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> traffic monitoring is needed...|$|R

5|$|After {{environmental}} {{studies on the}} White Slough, Caltrans widened and elevated that section {{of the road and}} converted it to a freeway. To accommodate <b>bicycles</b> <b>and</b> pedestrians, a cycleway was built along the eastbound side of the freeway. Finally, Caltrans completed the overpass which crossed SR 29, Broadway, and Mini Drive (bypassing Marine World Parkway, three traffic signaled intersections, and a railroad grade crossing). The project was completed in the summer of 2005, and fully open to traffic on August 20.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>bicycles</b> <b>and</b> {{motorcycles}} {{can appear}} to be simple mechanisms with only four major moving parts (frame, fork, and two wheels), these parts are arranged {{in a way that}} makes them complicated to analyze.

5|$|Bicycle and {{motorcycle}} dynamics is {{the science}} of the motion of <b>bicycles</b> <b>and</b> motorcycles and their components, due to the forces acting on them.

The study of these motions {{began in the late}} 19th century and continues today.|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{research activities}} conducted {{to develop a}} <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> pedestrian travel demand forecasting methodology. Previous research reports documented the literature review (Report 1723 - 1) and data collection activities (Report 1723 - 2). The appendix of this report contains guidelines for estimating <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> pedestrian travel demand based upon the type and intensity of land uses adjacent to a study corridor. Since little information or data on <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> pedestrian travel demand forecasting were available in Texas, the research team developed a sketch planning methodology by collecting <b>and</b> analyzing <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> pedestrian trip survey data at eight urban locations in four different cities in Texas. The bicycle/pedestrian survey data that were collected included specific information about individual trip origins and destinations, trip lengths, trip purpose, and trip frequency.

Motor cars were later introduced to the town. In 1924, Pujut Road was built to link Miri with Lutong. By 1925, rotary drilling was introduced. Oil production continued to increase until it reached a peak of 15,211 barrels per day in 1929. Water supply were improved, jungles were cleared, and more roads were built. Miri became the administrative centre of the entire Baram region in 1929.|$|E

40|$|Since the 1990 s, {{the amount}} of {{attention}} <b>and</b> funding for <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> pedestrian infrastructure has increased significantly. This, combined with the role of transportation in public health and environmental concerns, has raised expectations for engineering and planning practitioners to possess more knowledge and skills related to pedestrian <b>and</b> <b>bicycle</b> planning <b>and</b> design. This demand requires more education around these topics but university curriculum doesn?t reflect these important shifts in the field. This project was intended to begin addressing the need for more <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> pedestrian curriculum in two ways: (1) Determine the existence of and need for courses and curriculum modules on <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> pedestrian design and planning by conducting a national survey of planning and transportation faculty; and (2) Expand the range of opportunities for university students to learn about the value <b>and</b> needs of <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> pedestrian transportation by designing and testing two new curriculum modules, one for transportation planning and one for transportation engineering. The survey provides a comprehensive source of information on the amount and type of coverage given to <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> pedestrian topics in transportation planning and engineering courses at the graduate and undergraduate level. It also provides useful insight into faculty and student interest in these topics, and a rich data source which IBPI can use to identify areas for future module and curriculum development. The process of developing and piloting the two curriculum modules demonstrated how <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> pedestrian topics can be successfully integrated into existing courses that may have a broader transportation scope. In addition, the feedback on the student evaluations illustrated the low level of student knowledge about some of the basic elements of <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> pedestrian facilities design and analysis. This supports the need for more integration of these topics into transportation planning and engineering courses...|$|R

5|$|The United States {{has been}} a leader in {{technological}} innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century.

This technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry, enabled the U.S. to have large scale manufacturing of sewing machines, <b>bicycles</b> <b>and</b> other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system of manufacturing.

5|$|After the war, {{he started}} selling <b>bicycles</b> <b>and</b> motorbikes {{in a small}} shop in Brunswick Street, in the Kensington Fields area of Liverpool. He began selling and {{recharging}} batteries in 1925, opening a shop {{in the front room}} of his family's three-storey Georgian terraced house, called Phillips’ Battery Charging Depot, and had to install large accumulators in the cellar. Phillips ran the business for 30 years, even during WWII, but due to a decline in demand for batteries in the early 1950s (most people having electricity by then) he started selling household electrical goods. By late 1954, the shop was only selling records and record players; customers would buy recordings of American Country and Western, and Big Band music. As Phillips had supplied batteries to the Burtonwood air base during the war, he could buy and sell the latest records from America via his contacts there.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bicycles</b> <b>and</b> {{motorcycles}} {{are both}} single-track vehicles and so their motions have many fundamental attributes in common and are {{fundamentally different from}} {{and more difficult to}} study than other wheeled vehicles such as dicycles, tricycles, and quadracycles. As with unicycles, bikes lack lateral stability when stationary, and under most circumstances can only remain upright when moving forward. Experimentation and mathematical analysis have shown that a bike stays upright when it is steered to keep its center of mass over its wheels. This steering is usually supplied by a rider, or in certain circumstances, by the bike itself. Several factors, including geometry, mass distribution, and gyroscopic effect all contribute in varying degrees to this self-stability, but long-standing hypotheses and claims that any single effect, such as gyroscopic or trail, is solely responsible for the stabilizing force have been discredited.|$|E
