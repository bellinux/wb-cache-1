5|$|Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) mind flashes back {{to being}} in the attic with his sister Samantha while their parents are arguing downstairs. Back in the present, Mulder awakens {{in a hotel room}} in Providence, Rhode Island, covered in blood. Mulder calls Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who arrives, finding him in shock. Mulder has a {{pounding}} headache and has no memory of what he has done in the past two days. Scully finds that two bullets have been fired from Mulder's gun and that he has keys belonging to a David and Amy Cassandra. Scully wants Mulder to check into a hospital, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> find out if he was involved in a crime before doing so. The agents arrive at the Cassandra's house where the housekeeper tells them they are not at home. Mulder recognizes a house in many of Cassandra's paintings: a house that is near his parent's summer home in Rhode Island. When they arrive there, Mulder has striking pains in his head and flashes back again to when he was a child, seeing a younger version of The Smoking Man (Chris Owens) in his home. The agents enter the home, where they find the Cassandras dead from gunshot wounds.|$|E

Charlie stops the questioning and tells Raymond he is happy to have him as his brother.|$|E

Discovering that the Communist Chinese are arming the PKI, Bryant passes this information to Hamilton to save his life, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> cover the Communist rebellion that will occur when the arms shipment reaches Jakarta. Shocked, Kwan and Bryant withdraw their friendship from Hamilton, and he is left with the American journalist Pete Curtis (Michael Murphy), and his own assistant and driver Kumar (Bembol Roco), who is secretly PKI.

500|$|Heikkinen {{received}} 226points in the United Press poll, {{the fifth}} highest total in the balloting. The UP noted: “He dominated the voting for guards on ballots from the East, West, South and North. He has a trick on defense of jamming the opposition line {{and making a}} hole for a teammate to go through and get the ball carrier. On offense, he excels in swinging out to lead the interference and often gets in two blocks on a play. Motion pictures of the Ohio State-Michigan game show Heikkinen jamming opposing linesmen back from one to three yards on almost every play. He is so good that professional teams have approached him, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> study law.” ...|$|E
500|$|Roger advises Lane {{about how}} to ensnare a client at dinner. Roger informs Lane to find the man's source of regret, and make it {{relatable}} to himself, forming a [...] "conspiracy" [...] of feeling between the pair. Pryce's dinner does not go smoothly; the Jaguar representative appears to have no regrets in his life, and Lane is forced to plan another lunch to try again at confirming the new business. Upon hearing of this failure, Pete tactfully tells Lane to maintain a friendly relationship with the target, and to let Accounts take the business from there. Roger compliments Pete's letting Lane down softly and taking the task off his hands, forming a renewed alliance with Pete. At the dinner meeting, Edwin, the Jaguar representative, assures Don, Roger, and Pete they have his business, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> have some fun. The executives quickly learn what kind of fun Edwin has in mind and they visit a local brothel, where Edwin, Roger, and Pete all cheat on their wives, leaving Don at the bar. Don later shares a cab with Pete {{on the way home}} in which the latter, drunk, criticizes Don as hypocritical for judging Pete's adulterous actions. Don explains he is not judging; he merely didn't know Pete was miserable. Pete replies sarcastically that he has everything, and Don warns him not to throw it away.|$|E

2500|$|Nash {{is under}} extreme {{pressure}} to publish, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> publish his own original idea. His inspiration comes {{when he and}} his fellow graduate students discuss how to approach a group of women at a bar. Hansen quotes Adam Smith and advocates [...] "every man for himself", but Nash argues that a cooperative approach would lead to better chances of success. Nash develops a new concept of governing dynamics and publishes an article on this. On the strength of this, he is offered an appointment at MIT where Sol and Bender join him.|$|E
2500|$|Since his injury, Lewis {{has been}} cleared to {{participate}} in organized team activities, including on-field work, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> make sure he remains healthy for {{the rigors of the}} preseason. He was quotes as saying [...] "As of right now I want to get through this offseason program and make sure everything is good," [...] he said. [...] "I want to get confident with my knees right now so, when training camp starts, I'm full throttle and there's no holding back whatsoever." [...] When asked about off-season conditioning, Lewis replied: [...] "I think I'm a lot stronger, especially in my upper body. My lower body feels stronger than it was prior to the injury. I'm excited to see what I can do now with a year of NFL lifting and training without banging on (the knee)." [...] He competed for the starting job in the 2009 NFL Season.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{tradition}} Coleridge relies on, the Tatar worship the sun because it reminds them of paradise, and they build gardens {{because they want}} to recreate paradise. Kubla Khan is of the line of Cain and fallen, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> overcome that state and rediscover paradise by creating an enclosed garden. The dome, in Thomas Maurice's description, in The History of Hindostan of {{the tradition}}, was related to nature worship as it reflects the shape of the universe. Coleridge, when composing the poem, believed in a connection between nature and the divine but believed that the only dome that should serve as the top of a temple was the sky. He thought that a dome was an attempt to hide from the ideal and escape into a private creation, and Kubla Khan's dome is a flaw that keeps him from truly connecting to nature. Maurice's History of Hindostan also describes aspects of Kashmir that were copied by Coleridge in preparation for hymns he intended to write. The work, and others based on it, describe a temple with a dome. Purchas's work does not mention a dome but a [...] "house of pleasure". The use of dome instead of house or palace could represent the most artificial of constructs and reinforce the idea that the builder was separated from nature. However, Coleridge did believe that a dome could be positive if it was connected to religion, but the Khan's dome was one of immoral pleasure and a purposeless life dominated by sensuality and pleasure.|$|E
