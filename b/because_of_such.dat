5|$|In 1629, {{work was}} {{interrupted}} by flooding, over two metres in depth. Parts of the city were damaged, especially around the main plaza or Zocalo. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> damage, this site was almost abandoned and a new cathedral project was begun {{in the hills of}} the Tacubaya area to the west.|$|E
5|$|Many {{insects are}} parasites of other insects {{such as the}} {{parasitoid}} wasps. These insects are known as entomophagous parasites. They can be beneficial due to their devastation of pests that can destroy crops and other resources. Many insects have a parasitic relationship with humans such as the mosquito. These insects are known to spread diseases such as malaria and yellow fever and <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>such,</b> mosquitoes indirectly cause more deaths of humans than any other animal.|$|E
5|$|To {{counter the}} power of Saavedra, Moreno sought to modify the {{military}} balance of power by reforming the promotion rules. Up until that point, the sons of officials were automatically granted the status of cadet and were promoted just by seniority; Moreno arranged that promotions were earned by military merits instead. However, {{in the short run}} this measure worked against him, as it antagonised members of the military who got promoted precisely <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> rules.|$|E

5|$|Warfarin {{administration}} {{in the second and}} third trimesters is much less commonly associated with birth defects, and when they do occur, are considerably different from fetal warfarin syndrome. The most common congenital abnormalities associated with warfarin use in late pregnancy are central nervous system disorders, including spasticity and seizures, and eye defects. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> later pregnancy birth defects, anticoagulation with warfarin poses a problem in pregnant women requiring warfarin for vital indications, such as stroke prevention in those with artificial heart valves.|$|E
5|$|Gerard was {{a patron}} of learning, {{to the extent}} that he urged at least one of his clergy to study Hebrew, a {{language}} not commonly studied at that time. He himself was a student of astrology, which led to suggestions that he was a magician and a sorcerer. Partly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> rumours, and his unpopular attempts to reform his cathedral clergy, Gerard was denied a burial inside York Minster after his sudden death in 1108. His successor as archbishop subsequently had Gerard's remains moved into the cathedral church from their initial resting place beside the cathedral porch.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons {{has been}} dubbed into several other languages, {{including}} Japanese, German, Spanish, and Portuguese. It {{is also one of}} the few programs dubbed in both standard French and Quebec French. The show has been broadcast in Arabic, but due to Islamic customs, numerous aspects of the show have been changed. For example, Homer drinks soda instead of beer and eats Egyptian beef sausages instead of hot dogs. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> changes, the Arabized version of the series met with a negative reaction from the lifelong Simpsons fans in the area.|$|E

5|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{is particularly important}} for crops such as almond growing in California, where honey bees are the predominant pollinator and the crop value in 2011 was $3.6 billion. In 2000, the total U.S. crop value that was wholly dependent on honey bee pollination was estimated to exceed $15 billion. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> high demand in pollinators, the cost of renting honey bees has increased significantly, and California's almond industry rents approximately 1.6 million honey bee colonies during the spring to pollinate their crop. Worldwide, honeybees yield roughly $200 billion in pollination services.|$|E

25|$|Generally, y in {{historic}} spellings of names formed with the -i affix (not {{to be confused}} with a possessive -i- of plural objects, as in szavai!) can exist after many other letters (e.g.: Teleky, Rákóczy, Dézsy). Here are listed only examples which can be easily misread <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> spelling.|$|E
25|$|While {{the number}} of Non-governmental Organization have {{increased}} dramatically {{over the past few}} decades, fragmentation in aid policy is an issue. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> fragmentation, health workers in several African countries, for example, say they are so busy meeting western delegates that they can only do their proper jobs in the evening.|$|E
25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> diverse {{projects}} as the {{alignment of the}} Zürichsee-Gotthard railroad track along Mount Rigi, {{and the failure to}} construct a railroad up Mount Rigi departing from Greppen, tourism is not as important in Greppen as it is in nearby municipalities. Two restaurants of renown in Greppen are the Eidgenossen and St. Wendelin/Fische.|$|E

25|$|India {{is located}} between two major illicit opium {{producing}} centres in Asia – the Golden Crescent comprising Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran and the Golden Triangle comprising Burma, Thailand and Laos. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> geographical location, India experiences {{large amount of}} drug trafficking through the borders. India is the world's largest producer of licit opium for the pharmaceutical trade. But an undetermined quantity of opium is diverted to illicit international drug markets.|$|E
25|$|Japanese American culture places {{great value}} on {{education}} and culture. Across generations, children are often instilled with {{a strong desire to}} enter the rigors of higher education. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> widespread ambition among members of the Japanese American community, math and reading scores on the SAT and ACT may often exceed the national averages. Japanese Americans have the largest showing of any ethnic group in nationwide Advanced Placement testing each year.|$|E
25|$|Crandon {{performed}} {{many of her}} séances in the nude, and {{was reported}} to throw herself onto the laps of her male sitters. She was also described as an alcoholic. During séances, Eric Dingwall told Crandon to take off her clothes {{and sit in the}} nude. Crandon would also sometimes sprinkle luminous powder on her breasts and <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> activities William McDougall and other psychical researchers criticized Dingwall for having improper relations with Crandon.|$|E

25|$|Yet it was <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> anti-suffragists that Esther Hobart Morris {{made history}} {{for women in}} Wyoming in 1870 when she {{received}} an appointment as the nation's first female justice of the peace. Morris' historic posting in South Pass City, a mining town in Central Wyoming, followed the previous justice resigning in protest of Wyoming's suffrage legislation. Hebard spent many years advancing a claim that {{can be traced back}} to her trail marking companion H.G. Nickerson that Morris was an instigator and co-author of that legislation. That claim is considered false by some recent researchers.|$|E
25|$|Some {{animals have}} {{coloration}} {{which makes them}} highly conspicuous when outside their normal environment but highly cryptic when in it. For example, the blue morpho, a forest butterfly, has iridescent blue upper wings and a 17cm wingspan. However, because the underwings are dark, when the morpho flies through the flickering light of the forest or even out in daylight, it seems to disappear. Other forest species, especially mammals, use disruptive coloration and have spotted or striped pelage which helps break up the animal's outline. In the shade created by trees or other foliage, even large mammals such as leopards, jaguars, ocelots, and okapi are difficult to see <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> disruptive coloration.|$|E
25|$|In part <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> long {{retention}} times, {{as well as}} growing Internet upload speeds, Usenet is {{also used}} by individual users to store backup data in a practice called Usenet backup, or uBackup. While commercial providers offer more easy to use online backup services, storing data on Usenet is free of charge (although access to Usenet itself may not be). The method requires the user to manually select, prepare and upload the data. Because anyone can potentially download the backup files, the data is typically encrypted. After the files are uploaded, the uploader {{does not have any}} control over them; the files are automatically copied to all Usenet providers, so there will be multiple copies of it spread over different geographical locations around the world—desirable in a backup scheme.|$|E
50|$|The studios {{have been}} owned by Enterprise Waitakere, the {{business}} {{arm of the}} Waitakere City Council since 2002. It is <b>because</b> <b>of</b> studios <b>such</b> as Henderson Valley, South Pacific Pictures and Studio West, that West Auckland has been dubbed 'Westiewood'.|$|R
