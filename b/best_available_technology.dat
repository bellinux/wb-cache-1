2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} coal mining in the Whitehaven area {{is in the}} time of Prior Langton (1256–82) of St Bees Priory, concerning the coal mines at Arrowthwaite. St Bees Priory was dissolved in 1539, and the lands and mineral rights passed to secular owners. In 1560 Sir Thomas Chaloner granted bases of land for digging coal, and in 1586 he granted St Bees School liberty [...] "to take 40 loads of coal at his coal pits in the parish of St Bees {{for the use of the}} school". In 1670, the manor of St. Bees was bought by Sir John Lowther – he then began to develop the coal trade due to the ever-increasing demand from Ireland. Lowther invested in the <b>best</b> <b>available</b> <b>technology</b> to help monopolise the coal trade. By the 1730s Whitehaven had the deepest mines due to the necessity to drive ever deeper shafts to reach new seams of coal.|$|E
2500|$|While {{efficient}} {{energy use}} and resource efficiency are growing as public policy issues, more than 70% of coal {{plants in the}} European Union are more than 20 years old and operate at an efficiency level of between 32–40%. Technological developments in the 1990s have allowed efficiencies {{in the range of}} 40–45% at newer plants. However, according to an impact assessment by the European Commission, this is still below the best available technological (BAT) efficiency levels of 46–49%. With gas-fired power plants the average efficiency is 52% compared to 58–59% with <b>best</b> <b>available</b> <b>technology</b> (BAT), and gas and oil boiler plants operate at average 36% efficiency (BAT delivers 47%). According to that same impact assessment by the European Commission, raising the efficiency of all new plants and the majority of existing plants, through the setting of authorisation and permit conditions, to an average generation efficiency of 51.5% in 2020 would lead to a reduction in annual consumption of [...] of natural gas and [...] of coal.|$|E

40|$|The article {{examines}} the issues of creation of the <b>best</b> <b>available</b> <b>technologies</b> of form-shaping and the methodology of quantitative evaluation of their effectiveness. It is shown that creation of a unified methodology for generation of <b>best</b> <b>available</b> <b>technologies</b> of form-shaping and quantitative evaluation {{of the effectiveness of}} these technologies is possible on the basis of energy-related representation of technological processes. In this case, the technological process is represented as two processes - the process of converting electrical energy into mechanical energy and the process of transfer of mechanical energy to the processing zone. This approach allows to create unified methodologies regardless of the wide variety of technological processes of form-shaping, conditions and parameters of their implementation. It is shown that for each particular implementation of technological processes of form–shaping, energy losses during conversion and transfer of energy and increased consumption of current due to "underload" of process equipment determine the environment friendliness of each specific implementation of the technological process. The main directions for improvement of efficiency of the <b>best</b> <b>available</b> <b>technologies</b> of form-shaping are indicated...|$|R
