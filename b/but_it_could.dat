5|$|The Orangi Pilot Project {{was very}} {{different}} from the Comilla Academy. OPP was a private body, dependent for its small fixed budget on another NGO. The vast resources and support of the government, Harvard advisors, MSU, and Ford Foundation was missing. OPP possessed no authority, no sanctions. It may observe and investigate <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> only advise, not enforce.|$|E
5|$|A long-standing {{mystery of}} Venus {{observations}} {{is the so-called}} ashen light—an apparent weak illumination of its dark side, seen when the planet is in the crescent phase. The first claimed observation of ashen light was made in 1643, but {{the existence of the}} illumination has never been reliably confirmed. Observers have speculated it may result from electrical activity in the Venusian atmosphere, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be illusory, resulting from the physiological effect of observing a bright, crescent-shaped object.|$|E

5|$|Meetings {{could take}} place either inside or outside of the formal {{boundary}} of the city (the pomerium), though the official meeting place, or curia was at {{the centre of the}} Roman forum. The president of the Senate was normally one of the consuls, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be called to meet by any of the praetors or tribunes, both of whom had the authority to call the Senate, though praetors rarely did so unless the consuls were away and the tribunes almost never did so. Meetings were suffused in religious ritual. Temples were a preferred meeting site and auspices would be taken before the meeting could commence.|$|E
5|$|On 31 December 1888, {{his body}} was found {{floating}} in the River Thames, off Thornycroft's torpedo works, Chiswick, by a waterman named Henry Winslade. Stones in Druitt's pockets had kept his body submerged for about a month. He was {{in possession of a}} return train ticket to Hammersmith dated 1 December, a silver watch, a cheque for £50 and £16 in gold (equivalent to £ and £ today). It is not known why he should have carried such a large amount of money, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have been a final payment from the school.|$|E
5|$|Pilot {{plants were}} {{built at the}} Anacostia Naval Air Station and the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and a {{production}} facility at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This was the only production-scale liquid thermal diffusion plant ever built. It could not enrich uranium sufficiently for use in an atomic bomb, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> provide slightly enriched feed for the Y-12 calutrons and the K-25 gaseous diffusion plants. It was estimated that the S-50 plant had sped up production of enriched uranium used in the Little Boy bomb employed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima by a week.|$|E

5|$|The {{limitation}} of the argument so far is that it only shows {{the existence of a}} necessary existent, and that is different from showing the existence of God as worshipped in Islam. An atheist might agree that a necessary existent exists, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be the universe itself, or there could be many necessary existents, none of which is God. Avicenna is aware of this limitation, and his works contains numerous arguments to show the necessary existent must have the attributes associated with God identified in Islam.|$|E
5|$|The {{queen conch}} reaches sexual {{maturity}} at approximately 3 to 4 years of age, reaching a shell length of nearly 180mm and weighing up to 5 pounds. Individuals may usually {{live up to}} 7 years, though in deeper waters their lifespan may reach 20–30 years and maximum lifetime estimates reach 40 years. It is believed that the mortality rate tends to be lower in matured conchs due to their thickened shell, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be substantially higher for juveniles. Estimates have demonstrated that its mortality rate decreases as its size increases and can also vary due to habitat, season and other factors.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1 was {{initially}} expected to work {{only through the}} Saturn encounter. When the spacecraft passed the planet in 1980, Sagan proposed {{the idea of the}} space probe taking one last picture of Earth. He pointed out that such a picture would not have had much scientific value, as the Earth would appear too small for Voyagers cameras to make out any detail, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have been meaningful nevertheless as a perspective on our place in the universe.|$|E

5|$|Æthelbert retired {{some time}} before his death, consecrating Eanbald as his successor. The exact date this {{occurred}} is unclear. Alcuin gives a date corresponding to July 778, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be 777 too. Eanbald's position may have just been as an associate bishop, with Æthelbert remaining in office until his death while sharing the office with Eanbald. During his retirement, he had constructed a new church dedicated to Alma Sophia. He {{lived long enough to}} consecrate the new church, ten days before his death on 8 November.|$|E
5|$|A {{forensic}} {{examination of}} Docherty's body indicated she {{had probably been}} suffocated, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not be proven. Although the police suspected the men of other murders, {{there was no evidence}} on which they could take action. An offer was put to Hare granting immunity from prosecution if he turned king's evidence. He provided the details of Docherty's murder and confessed to all 16 deaths; formal charges were made against Burke and his wife for three murders. At the subsequent trial Burke was found guilty of one murder and sentenced to death. The case against his wife was found not proven—a Scottish legal verdict to acquit an individual but not declare them innocent. Burke was hanged shortly afterwards, his corpse was dissected and his skeleton displayed at the Anatomical Museum of Edinburgh Medical School where, as of 2017, it remains.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{watertight}} bulkheads extended {{well above}} the water line, they were not sealed at the top. If too many compartments were flooded, the ship's bow would settle deeper in the water, and water would spill from one compartment to the next in sequence, rather like water spilling {{across the top of}} an ice cube tray. This was what happened to Titanic, which had suffered damage to the forepeak tank, the three forward holds and No.6 boiler room, a total of five compartments. Titanic was only designed to float with any two compartments flooded, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> remain afloat with certain combinations of three or even four compartments (the first four) open to the ocean. With five compartments, the tops of the bulkheads would be submerged and the ship would continue to flood.|$|E

5|$|By January 1957, {{with the}} tests just months away, a {{tentative}} schedule had emerged. Short Granite would be fired first. Green Bamboo would follow if Short Granite was unsuccessful, but be omitted as unnecessary otherwise. Orange Herald (small) would be fired next. Because Short Granite was {{too large to}} fit into a missile or guided bomb, this would occur whether or not Short Granite was a success. Finally, Green Granite would be tested. In December 1956, Cook had proposed another design, known as Green Granite II. This was smaller than Green Granite I, and could fit into a Yellow Sun casing that could be used by the Blue Steel guided missile then under development; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not be made ready to reach Christmas Island before 26 June 1957, and extending Operation Grapple would cost another £1.5 million.|$|E
5|$|By May 1942, Conant {{felt that}} the S-1 Committee had become too unwieldy. It had not met since the March meeting. When he needed expert advice in May, he had called upon a smaller group, and he {{recommended}} that this supervise the OSRD work, mainly the technical and contractual aspects of the project, while the Army handled engineering, construction and site selection. Procurement was an OSRD responsibility, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> turn to the Army for help in case of difficulties. Bush obtained the president's approval for this, and on June 19, 1942, he abolished the S-1 Section {{and replaced it with}} the S-1 Executive Committee. Conant was appointed as its chairman, and Briggs, Compton, Lawrence, Eger Murphree, and Urey as its other members.|$|E
5|$|For use in {{a binary}} digital computer, the tube had {{to be capable of}} storing either one of two states at each of its memory locations, {{corresponding}} to the binary digits (bits) 0 and1. It exploited the positive or negative electrostatic charge generated by displaying either a dash or a dot at any position on the CRT screen, a phenomenon known as secondary emission. A dash generated a positive charge, and a dot a negative charge, either of which could be picked up by a detector plate in front of the screen; a negative charge represented 0, and a positive charge1. The charge dissipated in about 0.2seconds, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be automatically refreshed from the data picked up by the detector.|$|E

5|$|Stephen again swore {{loyalty to}} Casimir IV in the {{presence}} of the Polish envoy in Suceava on 28 July 1468. He conducted raids against Transylvania between 1468 and 1471. When Casimir came to Lviv in February 1469 to personally receive his homage, Stephen did not go to meet him. In the same year or in early 1470, Tatars invaded Moldavia, but Stephen routed them in the Battle of Lipnic near the Dniester. To strengthen the defence system along the river, Stephen decided to erect new fortresses at Old Orhei and Soroca around the same time. A Wallachian army laid siege to Chilia, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not force the Moldavian garrison to surrender.|$|E
5|$|The Revolutionary War with France {{broke out}} in 1793, leading to the {{extensive}} modernisation of the castle. Repairs were carried out in 1794 {{at a cost of}} £647, followed by a review of the defences the next year by the Master-General of the Ordnance. The 16th-century castle was still strongly fortified {{by the standards of the}} time, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not support the heavier guns or batteries of artillery required to tackle enemy warships. Instead, two new gun batteries, each armed with five 36-pounder (16.3kg) guns, were built alongside the castle in 1795, with a further eighteen 9-pounder (4kg) guns mounted in the old fort; the guns concerned had all been captured from the French.|$|E
5|$|The main {{advantage}} of composite bows over self bows (made {{from a single}} piece of wood) is their combination of smaller size with high power. They are therefore more convenient than self bows when the archer is mobile, as from horseback, or from a chariot. Almost all composite bows are also recurve bows as the shape curves away from the archer; this design gives higher draw-weight {{in the early stages of}} the archer's draw, storing somewhat more total energy for a given final draw-weight. It would be possible to make a wooden bow that has the same shape, length and draw-weight as a traditional composite bow, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not store the energy, and would break before full draw.|$|E
