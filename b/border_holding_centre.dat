It {{was decided that}} Displaced Persons would go to <b>Holding</b> <b>Centres,</b> where the {{dependants}} would stay until the [...] "breadwinner" [...] of the family, working {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>Holding</b> <b>Centre,</b> could afford accommodation elsewhere. However, if a worker was allocated to a Worker's Hostel that had room for dependants, the family might be able to live together at the hostel. Although the Department of Immigration administered <b>Holding</b> <b>Centres,</b> the Department of Labour and National Service administered Worker's Hostels.|$|R

5000|$|In June 1949 the Department of Immigration was {{planning}} to open four <b>Holding</b> <b>Centres</b> for [...] "New Australians" [...] in Queensland. Wacol opened 9 November 1949, on Army land; Stuart, on RAAF land south of Townsville (the former Operations and Signals Bunker at Stuart) opened 30 March 1950; Frazer's Paddock at Enoggera opened 14 April 1950, on Army land; and Cairns opened 19 August 1950, on acquired land. In 1952 the standard capacities of these camps were listed as: Wacol 1465; Stuart 500; Enoggera 515; and Cairns 370. At this time 13 <b>Holding</b> <b>Centres</b> were still active in Australia. By April 1960 Wacol was the only migrant <b>Holding</b> <b>Centre</b> left in Queensland.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first years}} at the Benalla Migrant Camp were the busiest, with a peak {{occupancy}} of 1063 migrants in 1951. The number of migrant arrivals decreased markedly when the displaced persons scheme drew {{to an end in}} 1952 and a number of <b>holding</b> <b>centres</b> closed.|$|R
40|$|Berried {{lobsters}} {{collected from}} landing <b>centres</b> and lobster <b>holding</b> <b>centres</b> {{were used for}} larval rearing of the spiny lobsters, Panulirus homarus (Linnaeus, 1758), Panulirus ornatus (Fabricius, 1798) and Panulirus versicolor (Latrielle, 1804). Fecundity of the lobsters used for larval rearing was calculated {{as the number of}} eggs deposited on the ovigerous setae on the pleopods. The number of eggs in a single brood ranged from 1, 20, 544 to 4, 49, 585 in P. homarus. 5, 18, 181 to P. ornatus 1, 979, 522 and that of P. versicolor as 1, 70, 212 to P. versicolor 7, 33, 752. The tropical lobsters are reported to and therefore breed two times or more in a year. The absolute (annual) fecundity of these lobsters is expected to be higher. The phyllosoma larvae released, as percentage of fecundity, was maximum in P. homarus 85. 7, 49. 7 in P. ornatus and 74. 0 in P. versicolor. Handling of lobsters at the landing and <b>holding</b> <b>centres</b> and aerial transport resulted in high percentage of eggs in arrested development, complete or partial shedding of eggs and release of weak phyllosoma larvae. Severe bacterial infection leading to complete shedding of eggs was recorded in a few breeders collected from <b>holding</b> <b>centres...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Benalla Migrant Camp, {{formally}} {{known as}} the Benalla <b>Holding</b> <b>Centre</b> and the Benalla Migrant Accommodation Centre, was one of 23 similar camps established by the Australian government to provide temporary housing for non-British new arrivals in post-World War II Australia. The Camp occupied the former Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) No.11 Elementary Flying Training School (1941-1944), adjacent to a small aerodrome {{on the outskirts of}} Benalla in north east Victoria. Opening in 1949, the Benalla Migrant Camp was a modest-sized <b>holding</b> <b>centre,</b> accommodating 200 - 400 people. It survived national reviews of migrant accommodation needs in 1953 and 1959, but by 1967, the number of residents had diminished sufficiently for the Camp to close. By that time, over 60,000 people — mainly of Polish, Latvian and German origins, as well as other nationalities — had been accommodated there.|$|R

50|$|Initial {{government}} policy was that British migrants {{would not be}} sent to <b>Holding</b> <b>Centres.</b> The Immigration Depot at Yungaba, Kangaroo Point, was remodelled to receive the first post-World War Two British migrants to Queensland, who left Britain in May 1947. In general though, Yungaba was used as transit depot for those British migrants who had their own accommodation arranged. British migrants who needed longer-term accommodation would be housed at Workers' Hostels.|$|R
50|$|Camp {{residents}} received medical checks, {{and attended}} courses in English {{language and the}} Australian way of life.
