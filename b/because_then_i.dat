500|$|Letter III {{describes}} a tour around the environs of Vevey {{and other places}} associated with the Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau: [...] "This journey has been on every account delightful, but most especially, <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> first knew the divine beauty of Rousseau's imagination, as it exhibits itself in Julie." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{did not do}} {{well the}} last time <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> was young {{and did not have}} the experience. I have just made it to the senior level and {{qualified}} for the Olympics. Now I have the experience. I have won medals at major tournaments like the Asian Games and Commonwealth Games. Recently, I also beat the 2004 Olympic Games gold medallist [...] Artayev , so I have done quite well at the international level. So, definitely, everyone can expect a good showing from me in Beijing." ...|$|E
500|$|Pilou Asbæk, who {{was cast}} to play Euron Greyjoy, spoke in an {{interview}} about the filming of the Kingsmoot saying [...] "We spent two days on the Kingsmoot itself, and then two days on the montage. We shot it chronologically, which helped. The water was freezing cold. We shot the drowning many, many times. I remember looking down the shore, after I {{had been there for}} five or six hours, and I saw two smiling faces, in the form of Gemma Whelan and Alfie Allen. They were just smiling their asses off, because they weren't cold! They just had to run to the boat." [...] In regards to stunts, Asbæk continued, [...] "I {{got a little bit of}} help, but not much. I think 95 percent of it was me. I like to do all of it when I can, <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> can feel it with the character." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, <b>then,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't like him--that is, I don't {{believe in}} him, and don't trust him. He's fascinating, but he's false and he's fickle. He can't help it, I dare say." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade and was {{produced}} by American record producer Ron Aniello. When asked about his experience with making songs for No Name Face {{in an interview with}} Billboard, Wade said, [...] "DreamWorks has been amazing in letting us make the record. They're super-artist-friendly. They let us make our record the way we wanted to make it. It's the best label we could be on." [...] In an interview with MTV Radio, Wade explained the message behind [...] "Sick Cycle Carousel" [...] and said, [...] "It's one of those songs I'm really afraid to put an explanation to as far as what it's about for me personally. I don't want it to lose its mystery and mystique. Everyone interprets it differently. It's funny hearing people telling what's it's about to them <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> can go, 'Maybe that's what it's about.' It's got a weird mystique to me still." [...] It was released on March 25, 2002 by DreamWorks Records.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{classical}} crossover success, Garðar has said, [...] "I don't {{want to go}} too {{far down}} the pop side <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> think I would lose credibility in the classical world. If the album [...] does well, hopefully I could use that to my advantage, but I'm a classical opera singer – that's what I do, that's what I am." [...] His ambition is to sing Otello at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, London.|$|E
2500|$|The school's principal, Gwendolyn Tose'-Rigell, explained, [...] "I don't {{think anyone}} could have handled it better. What would it have served if he had jumped {{out of his chair}} and ran out of the room?" [...] Some of the schoolchildren, now grown, have {{expressed}} similar views; Mariah Williams, one of the students, stated in 2011 that, [...] "I'm just glad he didn't get up and leave <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> would have been more scared and confused." ...|$|E
5000|$|Three songs I {{wrote for}} Blind Guardian. And when I noticed, {{when they were}} done, that the songs were very similar to old Blind Guardian stuff, more back-to-the-roots, I noticed {{that it would be}} big problem to present these songs to my ex-band members, <b>because,</b> OK, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> was still in the band, but I knew when I would play the songs to them they would say: [...] "Hey, this is {{something}} we already did ten years ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I couldn’t see it <b>then,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{was out of}} sorts; but I am in a {{healthier}} state now, and I acknowledge it with genuine pleasure. I made {{a great deal of}} a very little; that’s the fact.’ ...|$|R
3000|$|... “I {{became very}} anxious as I was getting {{more into the}} gambling. Maybe it’s because I {{was worried about the}} money I lost, the money I borrowed… I was also scared that I {{might not be able to}} control myself forever. <b>Then</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was so anxious, I needed to do something. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> went to the casino or bar to gamble.” [...]...|$|R
2500|$|... "Actually, I {{must also}} be criticised. I am {{not afraid of the}} {{criticism}} concerning what I do wrong, <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> know. If you say the king cannot be criticised, it means that the king is not human. [...] If the king can do no wrong, it is akin to looking down upon him, because the king is not being treated as a human being. But the king can do wrong....If someone offers criticisms suggesting that the king is wrong, then I would like to be informed of their opinion. If I am not, that could be problematic... If we hold that the king cannot be criticised or violated, then the king ends up in a difficult situation." ...|$|E
2500|$|During his 2005 {{birthday}} speech, Bhumibol invited criticism: [...] "Actually, I {{must also}} be criticised. I am not afraid if the criticism concerns what I do wrong, <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> know. Because if you say the king cannot be criticised, {{it means that the}} king is not human", he claimed. [...] "If the king can do no wrong, it is akin to looking down upon him because the king is not being treated as a human being. But the king can do wrong." [...] A widespread barrage of criticisms resulted, followed by a sharp rise in lèse-majesté prosecutions. Lèse-majesté cases rose from five or six a year pre-2005 to 478 in 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Takahashi {{said that}} she had been dreaming about the overall {{universe}} of Urusei Yatsura since she was very young. She said that the series [...] "really includes everything I ever wanted to do. I love science fiction because sci-fi has tremendous flexibility. I adopted the science fiction-style for the series <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> could write any way I wanted to". She wanted the reader to be completely surprised by the next panel and used slapstick comedy to create a reaction in the reader. When Takahashi ran out of ideas she would create new characters. Takahashi shared a small 150 square feet apartment with her assistants, and slept in a closet {{due to a lack of}} space. While writing Urusei Yatsura she also began work on Maison Ikkoku and used this experience as well as her university experience as the basis for the setting of that series.|$|E

2500|$|Jacob Brackman {{introduced}} fellow producer Bert Schneider to Terrence Malick in 1975. On {{a trip to}} Cuba, Schneider and Malick began {{conversations that}} would lead to the development of Days of Heaven. Malick had tried and failed to get Dustin Hoffman or Al Pacino to star in the film. Schneider agreed to produce the film. He and Malick cast young actors Richard Gere and Brooke Adams and actor/playwright Sam Shepard for the lead roles. Paramount Pictures CEO at the time Barry Diller wanted Schneider to produce films for him and agreed to finance Days of Heaven. At the time, the studio was heading in a new direction. They were hiring new production heads who had worked in network television, and, according to former production chief Richard Sylbert, [...] " [...] product aimed at your knees". Despite the change in direction, Schneider was able to secure a deal with Paramount by guaranteeing the budget and taking personal responsibility for all overages. [...] "Those were the kind of deals I liked to make ... <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> could have final cut and not talk to nobody about why we're gonna use this person instead of that person", Schneider said.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his celebrated flaws, history records Fox as {{an amiable}} figure. The Tory wit George Selwyn wrote that, [...] "I have passed two evenings with him, and never was anybody so agreeable, {{and the more}} so from his having no pretensions to it". Selwyn also said that [...] "Charles, I am persuaded, would have no {{consideration}} on earth but for what was useful to his own ends. You have heard me say, that I thought he had no malice or rancour; I think so still and am sure of it. But I {{think that he has}} no feeling neither, for anyone but himself; and if I could trace in any one action of his life anything that had not for its object his own gratification, I should with pleasure receive the intelligence <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> had much rather (if it were possible) think well of him than not". Sir Philip Francis said of Fox: [...] "The essential defect in his character and the cause of all his failures, strange as it may seem, was that he had no heart". Edward Gibbon remarked that [...] "Perhaps no human being was ever more perfectly exempt from the taint of malevolence, vanity, or falsehood." [...] Central to understanding Fox's life was his view that [...] "friendship was the only real happiness in the world." [...] For Fox, politics was the extension of his activities at Newmarket and Brooks's to Westminster. [...] "Fox had little or no interest in the exercise of power." [...] The details of policy – particularly of economics – bored him, in contrast with the intensity of Burke’s legal pursuit of Warren Hastings, and of Pitt’s prosecution of the war against France. Moreover, the Foxites were [...] "the witty and wicked" [...] satellites of their leader, as much friends as political allies.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, {{during an}} {{interview}} with MTV News, Knowles spoke about her more aggressive stage persona, Sasha Fierce. She said: [...] "I absolutely get scared every time I get on the stage. I get nervous. I'm actually really scared when I'm not nervous <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> don't transform into that person that {{people are used to}} seeing." [...] She added that in real life, she was nothing like the person people see in her videos and performances: [...] "I'm really more quiet, reserved. I speak when spoken to and polite. When I'm onstage, I'm aggressive, I'm strong, I'm fearless." [...] Knowles' third album I Am... Sasha Fierce formally introduced Sasha Fierce as her alter ego; she revealed that Sasha was born during the making of her single [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] (2003). In an interview with People magazine, Knowles affirmed that her alter ego is strictly for the stage and Sasha Fierce was further described as the singer's sensual, aggressive alter ego. In October 2008, Billboard magazine reported that Knowles would go on tour in the spring of 2009 to support her third studio album. Beyoncé's father and manager Mathew Knowles revealed that it would visit different countries worldwide. The tour dates for the European leg were announced in December 2008. During an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Knowles confirmed that she was excited about the tour and that she would be backed by her all-female band which also accompanied her during her previous tour The Beyoncé Experience (2007). She also stated that she worked on the tour for eight months, rehearsing and trying to put the set list together. Knowles further revealed that the twelve-hour rehearsals for the tour included dancing the choreography in heels for two months before it commenced. She also added that she learnt to make transition from herself to Sasha Fierce really fast for the performances. Knowles further acknowledged that I Am... World Tour was a huge production and that she was proud of the theatrical show she created. She said that it was a mixture of everything she loved: [...] "I tried to bring jazz and hip-hop, and ballet and fashion, and everything together... It is the best thing I've done as far as my tours go." ...|$|E

5000|$|... “I {{was really}} annoyed because I {{thought that if}} an idiot like that guy could say {{he wanted to be}} a director, <b>then</b> so could <b>I,</b> and {{certainly}} I should be a director more than he should. It had never occurred to me that that was a job possibility. He put the thought in my head <b>because</b> until <b>then</b> <b>I</b> would never have thought of saying that I wanted to do that; it didn’t seem to be one of the jobs in the world that could be open to me.” At this time, Heckerling also joined the Museum of Modern Art, where she attended screenings of old movies on weekends.|$|R

Now, however, I am better than I was even before the attack, only wishing that it were possible to hook-and-eye on another summer to the hem of the garment of this last sunny one. At the end of such a double summer, to measure things humanly, I might {{be able to go to}} see you at Hampstead. Nevertheless, winters and adversities are more fit for us than a constant sun.|$|R
5000|$|Some of Testino's most {{recognizable}} work derives from his portraits of royals, most famously, his series with Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997. Commissioned for Vanity Fair he said: [...] "Diana {{opened a door}} for me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>then</b> started photographing the royal families of Europe extensively... this brings out my love for tradition, for a way of showing family and the longevity of people".|$|R

6000|$|D'Alcacer {{remained}} {{silent for a}} while as though he were pursuing another train of thought altogether, then in a gentle, almost playful tone: [...] "If I were a woman," [...] he said, turning to Mrs. Travers, [...] "I would always trust my intuition."--"If you were a woman, Mr. d'Alcacer, I would not be speaking to you in this way <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> would be suspect to you." ...|$|E

5000|$|Several years later, Noelle-Neumann's Nazi {{connection}} {{came under}} scrutiny from another American academic, {{but she never}} explicitly apologized for her past. Interviewed on the subject in 1997, she said, [...] "I did my duty and would do my duty again in a second life.
