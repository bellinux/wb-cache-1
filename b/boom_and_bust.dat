5|$|Though {{sometimes}} productive, no {{nineteenth century}} iron mine on the Brendon Hills was profitable and the venture {{as a whole}} was financially ruinous. Furthermore, the industry {{as a whole was}} prone to <b>boom</b> <b>and</b> <b>bust,</b> with a sharp decline from the early 1880s. The railway continued in operation after the end of mining, although it had lost its primary traffic. A second-hand Robey semi-portable steam engine was installed {{at the head of the}} incline to power the drums, hauling wagons up in the absence of a regular downhill flow.|$|E
5|$|Abir's rubber {{gathering}} practices made it {{the most}} notorious of all the concession companies for human rights abuses in the Congo Free State. Abir was only involved with primary resource gathering and, despite being owned by European industrialists, operated in a style similar to warlords such as Tippu Tip. Abir was supported in its operations by the Free State which required the enormous profits generated to strengthen its control over the country during its formative years. The concession companies gave the Free State the time and revenue required to secure the Congo and to plan a long-term and more stable program of colonisation. Abir ultimately failed as its harvesting process valued high production over sustainability and it doomed to live out its own <b>boom</b> <b>and</b> <b>bust</b> cycle. Despite this the Abir production model {{was used by the}} French government as the basis for its concession system in the French Congo.|$|E

This explanation is in line with survey evidence on the expectations of representative U. S. households and allows to match the behavior of postwar U. S. stock prices. The second chapter shows that, in the presence of belief-driven <b>booms</b> <b>and</b> <b>busts,</b> a financial transaction tax may lead to higher stock price volatility by increasing the likelihood of <b>booms</b> <b>and</b> <b>busts.</b> The third chapter analyzes the efficiency of investment professionals’ expectations and documents key differences to the expectations of representative households...|$|R

40|$|JOB MARKET PAPER This paper {{incorporates}} speculation {{into the}} standard supply-and-demand frame-work {{used to analyze}} housing <b>booms</b> <b>and</b> <b>busts.</b> Speculation reverses the common intu-ition that elastic housing supply attenuates housing booms. Housing market frictions make land a more attractive speculative investment than housing. As a result, unde-veloped land both facilitates construction and intensifies the speculation that causes <b>booms</b> <b>and</b> <b>busts</b> in house prices. This insight explains the frequent housing <b>booms</b> <b>and</b> <b>busts</b> that coincide with high construction activity (e. g. Las Vegas, 2000 - 2010). These episodes {{are most likely to}} occur when a housing market nears but has not yet reached a long-run development constraint. Consistent with the recent U. S. housing experience, the model predicts higher price volatility in neighborhoods where housing is more easily rented. Land is an asset whose price volatility can increase with its float...|$|R

It {{identifies}} major and persistent deviations from long term trends for 18 countries and estimates the probabilities of their occurrence using a Random Effects Panel Probit model {{over the period}} 1980 - 2007. It finds that 1) most recent housing booms have been very persistent and of a significant magnitude; 2) {{there appears to be}} a strong correlation between the persistence <b>and</b> magnitude of <b>booms</b> <b>and</b> subsequent busts; 3) economic costs (in terms of GDP losses during the post-boom phase) depend significantly on the magnitude and duration of the <b>boom</b> <b>and</b> money and credit developments during that period; 4) a number of policy variables, including short term interest rates, local and global money and credit developments, and the incidence of mortgage market deregulation affect significantly the probability of experiencing <b>booms</b> <b>and</b> busts; and 5) the model is quite successful in identifying <b>booms</b> <b>and</b> <b>busts</b> early on.

All the same, tobacco endured as the territory's staple crop, while the growers came to dominate Southern Rhodesian politics, holding a majority in the Legislative Council from 1911.
