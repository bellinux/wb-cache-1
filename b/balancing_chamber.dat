40|$|Abstract: Based on {{the basic}} {{structure}} of typical high-pressure gear pump, a new kind of high-pressure gear pump was designed and applied in water hydraulic transmission system. In this design, the floating plate of typical gear pump is ceramiclized to improve its wear-resisting property; the <b>balance</b> <b>chamber</b> was used to brace and lubricate the axle. Furthermore, the radial unbalanced force induced by the pressure difference of input and output is balanced by the structure of <b>balance</b> <b>chamber.</b> The dynamic characteristic of gear pump is improved and the axel wear is reduced. By using tip relief of tooth flank profile modification, the leakage rate of gear flank is effectively reduced, and the volume efficiency is improved. Water hydraulic transmission will be potentially applied in multi field with the advantage of its safe, non-pollution, clean, cheap and energy resource saving. All kinds of component applied in the water hydraulic transmission system is belong to green product, and will be the main researching and developing direction.

50|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{single-member}} districts tend to promote two-party systems (with some regional parties). Called Duverger's law, this principle has also been empirically supported by the cube rule which shows how the winning party in a first-past-the-post system is mathematically over-represented in the final chamber of representatives. Supporters view this as beneficial, as parliamentary governments are typically more stable in two-party systems, and minorities do not have undue power to break a coalition. First-past-the-post minimizes the influence of third parties and thus arguably keeps out extremists. Critics of two-party systems believe that two-party systems offer less choice to voters, create an exaggerated emphasis on issues that dominate more marginal seats, and does not completely remove the possibility of a <b>balanced</b> <b>chamber</b> (or hung parliament), which can also give undue power to independents and lead to even greater instability.|$|R
30|$|The Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science (ARES) Directorate at the NASA Johnson Space Center has {{developed}} {{state of the}} art thermal analysis testbeds to simulate instrumental conditions of the TEGA and SAM instruments. Samples were run in a Netzsch STA 449  F 1 Jupiter with simultaneous TG/DSC capability. This instrument consists of a furnace to heat the sample at rates up to 50 °C/min (this particular instrument is equipped with a silicon carbide furnace capable of heating samples to 1550 °C), a <b>balance</b> <b>chamber</b> that measures changes in sample mass during heating (TG), and a sample carrier that holds the sample and reference crucibles and measures the temperature of each to compute the difference in heat flow into the two cups (DSC). The instrument can be configured to use a variety of carrier gases, necessary to sweep evolved gases out of the oven and <b>balance</b> <b>chamber</b> for further analysis and instrument safety reasons (e.g. to remove corrosive gases). Helium and nitrogen were used as carrier gases for this work. A Pfeiffer Thermostar GSD 320 with a 1 - 200 AMU range PrismaPlus quadrupole mass spectrometer is coupled to the gas output of the TG/DSC for evolved gas analysis via a 500  μm inner diameter glass-lined stainless steel capillary. The entire path-length of the gas is heated to ≥ 200 °C to prevent gas condensation in the line before analysis. The Pfeiffer mass spectrometer was used in a mode that measures the peak value at each mass number from 1 - 100 AMU. One complete scan takes from 5 - 7  seconds to complete and experience has shown that this is sufficiently good time resolution to catch evolved gas peaks as one run takes on the order of an hour to complete. The SEM (secondary electron multiplier) detector was used during analysis due to its high sensitivity. The carrier gas signal was between 10 - 6 and 10 - 8 A (ion current) and the noise floor of the SEM is ~ 10 - 13 resulting in a sensitivity of 1 part in 107 or 1 in 105, depending on the instrument oven pressure.|$|R

40|$|Aiming at {{balancing}} and {{positioning of}} a new electro-hydraulic servo system with iso-actuation configuration, an extended state observer–based fractional order proportional–integral–derivative controller is proposed in this study. To meet the lightweight requirements of heavy barrel weapons with large diameters, an electro-hydraulic servo system with a three-chamber hydraulic cylinder is especially designed. In the electro-hydraulic servo system, the <b>balance</b> <b>chamber</b> of the hydraulic cylinder is used to realize active balancing of the unbalanced forces, while the driving chambers consisting of {{the upper and lower}} chambers are adopted for barrel positioning and dynamic compensation of external disturbances. Compared with conventional proportional–integral–derivative controllers, the fractional order proportional–integral–derivative possesses another two adjustable parameters by expanding integer order to arbitrary order calculus, resulting in more flexibility and stronger robustness of the control system. To better compensate for strong external disturbances and system nonlinearities, the extended state observer strategy is further introduced to the fractional order proportional–integral–derivative control system. Numerical simulation and bench test indicate that the extended state observer–based fractional order proportional–integral–derivative significantly outperforms proportional–integral–derivative and fractional order proportional–integral–derivative control systems with better control accuracy and higher system robustness, well demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed extended state observer–based fractional order proportional–integral–derivative control strategy...|$|R

MethodsSeven male adult patients with severe, irreversible biventricular failure (> 70 % thirty-day predicted mortality) who were not candidates for transplantation met all institutional review board study criteria and had placement of the AbioCor Implantable Replacement Heart. All were in cardiogenic shock despite maximal medical therapy, including inotropes and intra-aortic balloon pumps. Mean age was 66. 7 ± 10. 4 years (range, 51 - 79 years). Four of 7 patients had prior operations. Six had ischemic and one had idiopathic cardiomyopathy. All had 3 -dimensional computer-simulated implantation of the thoracic unit that predicted adequate fit. At the time of the operation, the internal transcutaneous energy transfer coil, battery, and controller were placed. Biventriculectomy was then performed, and the thoracic unit was placed in an orthotopic position and attached to the atrial cuffs and outflow conduits with quick-connects. The flow was adjusted to 4 to 8 L/min. Central venous and left atrial pressures were maintained at 5 to 15 mm Hg. The device is powered through transcutaneous energy transfer. An atrial flow-balancing chamber is used to adjust left/right <b>balance.</b> The <b>balance</b> <b>chamber</b> and transcutaneous energy transfer eliminate the need for percutaneous lines. ResultsThere was one intraoperative death caused by coagulopathic bleeding and one early death caused by an aprotinin reaction. There have been multiple morbidities primarily related to preexisting illness severity: 5 patients had prolonged intubation, 2 had hepatic failure (resolved in 1), 4 had renal failure (resolved in 3), and 1 each had recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, acute cholecystitis requiring laparotomy, respiratory failure that resolved after 3 days of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and malignant hyperthermia (resolved). There were 3 late deaths: one caused by multiple systems organ failure (postoperative day 56), one caused by a cerebrovascular accident (postoperative day 142), and one caused by retroperitoneal bleeding and resultant multiple systems organ failure (postoperative day 151). This latter patient was not able to tolerate anticoagulation (no anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy alone for 80 % of the first 60 days) and had a transient ischemic attack on postoperative day 61 and a cerebrovascular accident on postoperative day 130. At autopsy, blood pumps were clean. The 2 patients who had large cerebrovascular accidents had thrombus on the atrial cage struts. These struts have been removed for future implants. There has been no significant hemolysis or device-related infections. The <b>balance</b> <b>chamber</b> has allowed for left/right balance in all patients (left atrial pressure within 5 mm Hg of right atrial pressure). Three patients have taken multiple (> 50) trips out of the hospital, and 2 have been discharged from the hospital. Total days on support with the AbioCor are 759. ConclusionThe initial clinical experience suggests that the AbioCor might be effective therapy in patients with advanced biventricular failure. There have been no significant device malfunctions.

Various factors influencing CH 4 emissions were evaluated and temperature of water and soil was found to be the main driver in both sites. For upscaling of CH 4 fluxes to landscape scale, regression models were used which were specific for each of the contributing landforms. Ditches and bordering edges were emission hotspots and emitted together between 60 % and 70 % of the total terrestrial CH 4 emissions. Annual terrestrial CH 4 fluxes were estimated to be 203 (± 48 %), 162 (± 60 %) and 146 (± 60 %) kg CH 4 ha- 1 and 157 (± 63 %), 180 (± 54 %) and 163 (± 59 %) kg CH 4 ha- 1 in the intensively managed site and extensively managed site, for 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively.

Francis Poulenc was born on 7 th of January 1899 in Paris and lived there for a most of his life. He studied by Ricardo Viñes (piano) and Charles Koechlin (composition). He was a famous pianist at first (in Duo with baritone Piérre Bernac or soprano Denis Duval), then he became reputable also as a brilliant composer. He died of a heart attack on 30 th of January 1963. 	By Poulenc we would find works from every music forms and genres. Mostly he wrote songs and piano music. Famous are also his operas (e. g. Les Mamelles de Tirésias or Dialogues des Carmélites), then concertos (e. g.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 150 - 152) A Peltier Effect Diffusion Still (PEDS) is {{a multiple}} effect evaporator driven by solid state thermoelectric heat pumps {TEHPs}. TEHPs {{embedded in the}} walls between diffusion cells enhance the temperature gradient driving the separation process. To demonstrate feasibility, PEDS is applied to milk concentration. The classic lumped parameter TEHP equations are reformulated {{and the effect of}} thin film thermoelectrics included. Thin film, rather than modular TEHPs are imperative to control thermal contact resistance. The concept of a limiting pressure in each diffusion cell is introduced that resolves conflicting criteria between low diffusion resistance and evaporation without flashing. PEDS system performance is predicted with an algorithm that solves a multiply-nested, simultaneous heat and mass transfer problem, subject to the constraints imposed by thermoelectric heat pumping. For a broad range of operating conditions, the TEHP temperature rise approximately <b>balances</b> the <b>chamber</b> temperature drop, so small changes in external temperatures drive large changes in heat flux. For multiple cell separation processes, parallel and serial feed streams yield essentially the same result. Both system COP and thermoelectric heat transfer area are inversely proportional to heat flux. For a thermoelectric figure of merit of. 003 /K, a quarter inch diffusion cell gap, and a heat flux of 500 BTU/hr ft 2 (the expected upper limit for separation without splatteringj, predicted COP varies from 26 to 57 and the required area varies from 1. 6 to 3. 7 ft 2 /(lb/hr). PEDS COP compares favorably with measured COPs of 7 to over 20 for Mechanical Vapor Recompression units, the present state of the art. Current multiple effect evaporation units have COPs of less than 4, and the simple pot boiler has a COP of less than 1. Effective implementation of PEDS awaits development of thin film TEHPs...|$|R
