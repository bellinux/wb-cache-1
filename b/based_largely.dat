5|$|Healthy {{ecosystems}} provide vital {{goods and}} services to humans and other organisms. There are two major ways of reducing negative human impact and enhancing ecosystem services and {{the first of these}} is environmental management.

Most recently, they stayed in Taipei, Taiwan for over six months.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{having a}} loyal {{customer}} <b>base</b> <b>largely</b> of musicians and audio enthusiasts, MiniDisc met with only limited success. It was relatively popular in Japan during the 1990s {{but did not}} enjoy comparable sales in other world markets. Since then, recordable CDs, flash memory and HDD and solid-state-based digital audio players such as iPods have become increasingly popular as playback devices.|$|R

5|$|Police re-opened {{the murder}} inquiry in 1992 {{and again in}} 2003. Ten men were arrested in 2010 on {{suspicion}} of murder, and in 2013 one of them, Nicholas Jacobs, became the seventh person {{to be charged with}} Blakelock's murder, <b>based</b> <b>largely</b> on evidence gathered during the 1992 inquiry.

5|$|President Biya's Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM) was {{the only}} legal {{political}} party until December 1990. Numerous regional political groups have since formed.

5|$|Hergé's next Tintin story, The Broken Ear (1935–37), was {{the first}} for which the plot {{synopsis}} had been outlined from the start, being a detective story that took Tintin to South America.

50|$|According to {{sociologist}} Karen Sargsyan {{the party}} <b>base</b> <b>largely</b> consists of provincial rural population. Kotayk Province {{is widely considered}} its stronghold. During the 2012 parliamentary election, Prosperous Armenia came first and won around 47.5% {{of the vote in}} that province, well above the national average of 30%. While in the 28th electoral district, which includes the city of Abovyan and several surrounding villages, the party won over 71%.|$|R
5|$|In {{establishing}} the Temple, Aquino {{was joined by}} other ex-members of LaVey's Church, and soon Setian groups, or pylons, were established {{in various parts of}} the United States. The structure of the Temple was <b>based</b> <b>largely</b> on those of the ceremonial magical orders of the late nineteenth century, such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Ordo Templi Orientis.|$|E
5|$|Management {{of human}} {{consumption}} of resources is an indirect approach <b>based</b> <b>largely</b> on information gained from economics. Herman Daly has suggested three broad criteria for ecological sustainability: renewable resources should provide a sustainable yield (the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of regeneration); for non-renewable resources there should be equivalent development of renewable substitutes; waste generation should not exceed the assimilative capacity of the environment.|$|E
5|$|Manitoba has a {{moderately}} strong economy <b>based</b> <b>largely</b> on natural resources. Its Gross Domestic Product was C$50.834billion in 2008. The province's economy grew 2.4 percent in 2008, {{the third consecutive}} year of growth; in 2009, it neither increased nor decreased. The average individual income in Manitoba in 2006 was C$25,100 (compared to a national average of C$26,500), ranking fifth-highest among the provinces. As of October 2009, Manitoba's unemployment rate was 5.8 percent.|$|E
50|$|The {{airfield}} {{was developed}} into a major base used by both the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy units in the Vogelkop Peninsula, staging to other airfields to the south Aru and Kai Islands or east to New Guinea. The Japanese built a second 'hardtop' runway creating two strips of 4,530' and 2,660' respectively. Naval troops constructed 15 bomber and 24 fighter revetments with more under construction. The <b>base</b> <b>largely</b> escaped any Allied bombing until mid-1943.|$|R

5|$|The {{prominent}} {{position and}} striking colour {{of the flowers}} of T.truncata {{and many of its}} relatives within the subtribe Embothriinae in both Australia and South America strongly suggest it is adapted to pollination by birds, and has been for over 60 million years. The flower heads produce abundant nectar, which is fed upon by many bird species. The Tasmanian waratah has a swollen woody <b>base</b> <b>largely</b> under the soil known as a lignotuber, which stores energy and nutrients as a resource for rapid growth after a bushfire.|$|R
5|$|The {{economy of}} the City of Paris is today is <b>based</b> <b>largely</b> on {{services}} and commerce; of the 390,480 enterprises in the city, 80.6 percent are engaged in commerce, transportation, and diverse services, 6.5 percent in construction, and just 3.8 percent in industry. The story is similar in the Paris Region, or Île-de-France. 76.7 percent of enterprises are engaged in commerce and services, and 3.4 percent in industry.|$|E
5|$|To the Edge of the Earth {{was printed}} on {{post-consumer}} waste paper using minimal {{volatile organic compound}} inks and included a package made of ecological friendly materials. The photography for the extended play was handled by Jacques Descloitres, a photographer working within the NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, with additional works produced by the band's previous collaborator Sean Mosher-Smith of the Echo Designlab. Descloitres provided satellite images of {{different areas of the}} Arctic Circle <b>based</b> <b>largely</b> on observations from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer.|$|E
5|$|Work by Dodson (1975) {{recognized}} {{that there were}} many less taxa present in Alberta. Tetragonosaurus was found to be juveniles of Corythosaurus or Lambeosaurus. T. erectofrons was assigned to Corythosaurus <b>based</b> <b>largely</b> on biometric information. The only non-typic specimen of Tetragonosaurus, assigned to T. erectofrons, was found later to be referable to Hypacrosaurus, although the holotype of the species was still found to be assignable to Corythosaurus.|$|E

Härle has stated that Moby [...] "managed to wipe out all of his early good work and we found ourselves struggling for even the slightest bit of recognition.

5|$|A second full telling (even {{shorter than}} the summary of Hesiod) is in a Roman-era {{collection}} of myths; the account of Orion is <b>based</b> <b>largely</b> on the mythologist and poet Pherecydes of Leros. Here Orion is described as earthborn and enormous in stature. This version also mentions Poseidon and Euryale as his parents. It adds a first marriage to Side before his marriage to Merope. All that is known about Side is that Hera threw her into Hades for rivalling her in beauty. It also gives a different version of Orion's death than the Iliad: Eos, the Dawn, {{fell in love with}} Orion and took him to Delos where Artemis killed him.|$|E
5|$|By the Han dynasty, {{written law}} had matured from its archaic form <b>based</b> <b>largely</b> on natural law and social customs into a {{rational}} corpus influenced by politics {{and based on}} positive law. However, the Han dynasty law code established by Chancellor Xiao He (d. 193 BCE) was largely an extension of an existing Qin dynasty law code. Evidence for this includes archaeological finds at Qin-era Shuihudi and Han-era Zhangjiashan. The nine chapters of the law code consisted of statutes which dealt with criminality, while two of these chapters dealt with court procedure. Although it survives only in small fragments, it was allegedly a massive written work on 960 written scrolls. The code had 26,272 articles written in 7,732,200 words that outlined punishments. There were 490 articles {{on the death penalty}} alone which contained 1,882 offenses and 3,472 analogies or pieces of case law.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen is {{the major}} {{economic}} and financial centre of Denmark. The city's economy is <b>based</b> <b>largely</b> on services and commerce. Statistics for 2010 show {{that the vast majority}} of the 350,000 workers in Copenhagen are employed in the service sector, especially transport and communications, trade, and finance, while less than 10,000 work in the manufacturing industries. The public sector workforce is around 110,000, including education and healthcare. From 2006 to 2011, the economy grew by 2.5% in Copenhagen, while it fell by some 4% in the rest of Denmark. In 2010, the wider Capital Region of Denmark had a gross domestic product (GDP) of €88,366 million, and the 15th largest GDP per capita of regions in the European Union.|$|E
