40|$|The thermal {{condition}} of machine tools can profoundly affect the dimensional accuracy of manufactured parts. Consequently, reducing its influence {{has become increasingly}} important to modern manufacturing. One of the most convenient and effective ways to reduce thermal error and enhance working accuracy is volumetric error compensation, especially for CNC machine tools. However, currently available compensation methods are highly complicated and difficult to apply in industry. They require a high-precision laser interferometer to measure 21 geometric error components and numerous thermocouples to monitor temperature variations. These requirements make such techniques costly and time consuming. This paper describes {{the development of a}} simplified and economical method of compensating for thermally induced errors. Compensation is implemented on the basis of only three axial positioning errors, which are assumed to be functions of <b>ball</b> <b>screw</b> <b>nut</b> temperature and travel distance. Instead of an expensive laser interferometer and many thermocouples, a simple laser Doppler displacement meter and only three thermocouples are required for the proposed method.

A novel variable impedance compact compliant series elastic actuator (SEA) is designed to actuate the AFO with variable impedance and compliance. The actuator design consists of a servomotor, a ball screw, a torsional spring connecting the motor and the ball screw via a pair of spur gear, {{and a set of}} translational springs connecting the <b>ball</b> <b>screw</b> <b>nut</b> to the output link.

40|$|This Master of Science thesis {{depicts the}} {{mechanical}} design and physical implementa-tion of double H’-gantry manipulator called DOHMAN. The H’-gantry mechanism is belt driven, two dimensional positioning device {{in which the}} belt is arranged in capital “H” form, and enables one linear and one rotary movement. The Ball-Screw Spline, in addition, is mechanism that consists of <b>Ball</b> <b>Screw</b> <b>Nut,</b> Ball Spline Nut, and Lead Screw with screw and spline grooves that fit both nuts. This mechanism enables linear and rotary displacement along the same axis. The DOHMAN robot is made of two par-allel kinematic H’-gantry structures linked with a miniature Ball Screw-Spline mecha-nism. The resulting structure is capable of performing four degrees-of-freedom (DOF) displacements along the three Cartesian axes X, Y and Z {{as well as a}} rotation W around the Z axis. The size and the other geometries of the DOHMAN robot aim to fit into the microfactory concept (TUT-μF) developed at Tampere University of Technology. For position control and visual servoing of the robot, an additional module was de-signed and implemented. Custom design of mechanical parts along with the selection of off-the-shelf components was done for building the robot prototype. The chapters and the appendix of this thesis thoroughly explain the design decisions and the implementa-tion. During the design development a new innovative homing strategy for linear Z and angular W axes was suggested and later implemented. This innovative homing provides efficient use of space for mounting the limit switches, avoiding huge loss in the overall Z-axis movement, and significantly reduces the cabling issues in the moving structure. Besides the innovative homing, other advantages of DOHMAN are distributed actuation and homogeneous workspace. The distributed actuation decreases the overall mass of the moving structure and also reduces the cabling within the overall mechanical system. The consistency in the workspace eases the control of the robot because there are no regions to avoid while moving the end effector...|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} of machining errors {{has become increasingly}} important in modern manufacturing {{in order to obtain}} the required quality of parts. Geometric error makes up the basic part of the inaccuracy of the machine tool at the cold stage; however, as the machine running time increases, thermally-induced errors start {{to play a major role}} in machined workpiece accuracy. Dimensional accuracy of machined parts could be affected by several factors, such as the machine tool’s condition, the workpiece material, machining procedures and the operator’s skill. Of these, the machine condition plays an important role in determining the machine’s performance and its effects on the final dimensions of machined parts. The machine’s condition can be evaluated by its errors which include the machine’s built-in geometric and kinematic error, thermal error, cutting force-induced error and other errors. This research represents a detailed study of the effects of thermal errors of a machine tool on the dimensional accuracy of the parts produced on it. A new model has been developed for the prediction of thermally-induced errors of a three-axis machine tool. By applying the proposed model to real machining examples, the dimensional accuracy of machined parts was improved. The research work presented in this thesis has the following four unique characteristics:• Investigated the thermal effects on the dimensional accuracy of machined parts by machining several components at different thermal conditions of a machine tool to establish a direct relationship between the dimensional accuracy of machined parts and the machine tool’s thermal status. • Developed a new model for calculating thermally-induced volumetric error where the three axial positioning errors were modelled as functions of <b>ball</b> <b>screw</b> <b>nut</b> temperature and travel distance. The influences of the other 18 error components were ignored due to their insignificant influence. • Employed a Laser Doppler Displacement Meter (LDDM) with three thermocouples, instead of the expensive laser interferometer and the large number of thermocouples required by the traditional model, to assess the thermally-induced volumetric errors of a three-axis CNC machining centre. The thermally-induced volumetric error predictions were in good agreement with the measured results. • Applied the newly developed thermally-induced volumetric error compensation model for drilling operations to improve the positioning accuracy of drilled holes. The results show that positioning accuracy of the drilled holes was improved significantly after compensation. The absolute {{reduction of}} the positioning errors of drilled holes was an average 30. 44 μm at the thermal stable stage, while the average relative reduction ratio of these errors was 77 %. Therefore, the proposed thermally-induced volumetric error compensation model can bean effective tool for enhancing the machining accuracy of existing machine tools used in the industry...|$|E
