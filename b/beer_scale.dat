5000|$|The International Bittering Units scale, {{or simply}} IBU scale, {{is used to}} {{approximately}} quantify the bitterness of <b>beer.</b> This <b>scale</b> is not measured on the perceived bitterness of the beer, but rather the amount of iso-alpha acids. There are several methods to measure IBU. The most common and widely used way is through spectrophotometry. In this process, hops are boiled in wort to promote isomerization. Since the iso-alpha acids are slightly hydrophobic, a reduction of the pH by adding acid increases the hydrophobicity of the iso-alpha acids. At this point, an organic solution is added and the iso-alpha acids shift to the organic layer out of the aqueous wort. This new solution is then placed in a spectrophotometer and the absorbance is read at 275 nm. At this wavelength, the iso-alpha acids have their highest absorbance which allows for the calculation of the concentration of these bittering molecules. This technique was adopted {{at the same time}} as another method based on measuring the concentration (in milligrams per litre; parts per million w/v) of isomerized α acids (IAA) in a beer, causing some confusion among small-scale brewers.The American Society of Brewing Chemists, in the introduction to its methods on measuring bitterness, points out some differences between the results of the two methods: ...|$|R

At the lab-scale process, 2 different parameters were chosen to dealcoholize beer samples, 102 mbar at 50 °C and 200 mbar at 67 °C. Samples taken at different steps of the process were analyzed by HS-SPME–GC–MS focusing on the concentration of 7 flavor compounds, 5 alcohols and 2 esters. For simulation process, the EoS parameters of the Wilson- 2 property package were adjusted to the experimental data and one more pressure was tested (60 mbar).

40|$|Influences on foam {{stability}} and cling were compared by brewing trials investigating beer hopping rate, hopping type and modification of beer protein composition by {{the inclusion of}} a proline specific protease (PSEP). The comparison of the NIBEM, Rudin and lacing foam assessment methods with the level of hopping demonstrated the superiority of hydrogenated hop α-acids with respect to {{foam stability}} and particularly lacing. In addition, the NIBEM and Rudin foam analysis tests appear to respond relatively similarly with respect to hopping rate and hop type, with the NIBEM being somewhat more responsive in terms of foam stability measurements. The PSEP trials suggested that protein composition may only have a subtle effect on foam stability. Although more specific to haze active proteins, PSEP treatment in the small and pilot scale trials generally, but not always, resulted in a minor reduction in foam stability. This effect was not observed in 20 hL pilot and industrial <b>scale</b> <b>beer</b> productions. It was verified that both NIBEM and Rudin were positively influenced by increased levels of foam positive proteins. Although both foam tests were responsive to hopping rate and type, it is suggested that the Rudin foam test is somewhat biased towards foam positive proteins, particularly albuminous foam positive proteins (LTP 1 and protein Z 4), while in comparison the NIBEM foam test appears somewhat biased towards hordein foam positive proteins.

40|$|Brewing yeast strains {{are usually}} {{aneuploid}} or polyploid with no true mating type. Thus {{many of the}} techniques {{which can be used}} to genetically modify laboratory yeast strains cannot be applied to them. This study was aimed at developing the technology for the genetic modification of brewing yeasts towards producing genetically improved brewing strains, suitable for use in large <b>scale</b> <b>beer</b> production. A system has been developed which can produce brewing yeast transformants with high genetic stability and unimpaired brewing performance. Such transformants contain only the required extra genetic material and no superfluous vector DNA. This system has also been demonstrated to have potential for the genetic labelling of yeast strains as a means of accurate identification which could also be used towards the patent protection of commercially important yeast strains. _ A method for the stabilisation of heterologous proteins produced in yeast has been investigated. The hypothesis that the glycosylation of heterologous proteins can improve their stability in yeast was tested by mutating the Escherichia coli ß-lactamase gene to produce N-linked glycosylation substrates. Two of the modified proteins were glycosylated when expressed in yeast, one of which had improved thermal stability. A wheat 11 -amylase gene yeast expression cassette has been constructed using the wheat secretion signal and yeast gene control sequences. Expression of the cassette in yeast results in efficient starch-degrading activity both in liquid and on solid media. The enzyme is efficíently secreted and approximately 90 % of the activity is found in yeast culture supernatants...|$|R
40|$|Despite of a well kept {{tradition}} over {{centuries to}} use oat as malted {{raw material for}} wort and beer production today this brewing cereal has been displaced almost completely. Ten different oat varieties where examined for their acceptability as brewing cereals and malted. The most favourable sample has even been used to brew different types of <b>beer</b> in pilot <b>scale.</b> The pilot maltings of these samples {{have been done in}} a 1 kg scale with 45 % moisture content, isotherm at 14, 5 °C (8 and 9 d vegetation time) and with a kilning temperature of 80 °C/ 3 h. The beer was brewed either in a 1, 5 kg or a 10 kg pilot plant. In both cases a lauter tun was used for solid-liquid-separation. Hot break was separated with a whirlpool. The wort was pitched at 10 °C with top fermenting wheat beer yeast (< 5 % dead cells, methylenblue-test) which was been cultivated several times in oat wort. After three days of main fermentation a maturation step at 16 °C and a two week storage time at 0 °C followed. The resulting beers have not been stabilised or filtered. The varieties differed only little. The malt with the extended malting time of one day demonstrated better levels of enzymatic activities and modification. Therefore the batch which was used for the brewing trials was malted with nine day vegetation time. All ten oat varieties had low levels of extract caused by the high level of husk material, which requires quite high proportion of water for mashing. The high portion of fatty acids was degraded only to a small amount. The low foam levels could be explained by the presence of fatty acids since they are not assimilated completely by the yeast. In addition fatty acids {{have a negative effect on}} flavour stability. In comparison to barley malt oat malt have considerably lower levels of enzymatic activity. On this account the enzymatic rests during mashing where noticeable laboured. Saccharification and lautering took place in a fast way. Main fermentation, maturation and storage ran smooth and efficient. All three beer types produced (Schank-, Voll- und Starkbier) offered a pleasant top fermenting aroma which still differ from the familiar southern german wheat beer aroma. The trials demonstrate that the cereal oat does contain a potential to produce a drinkable pleasing beer. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. Psoriasis vulgaris (plaque psoriasis) is {{a chronic}} {{recurring}} inflammatory skin disease that manifests most commonly as well-circumscribed, erythematous papules and plaques of varying sizes, covered with silvery <b>scales</b> (<b>Beers</b> et al., 2010). The condition itself {{is considered to}} be difficult to treat and manage by many types of healthcare practitioners, due in part to its unknown aetiology/trigger and partly {{due to the nature of}} the disease itself (Medonça and Burden, 2003). The aim of this study was to ascertain the effects of a Homoeopathic complex remedy on psoriasis. A group of twenty seven participants completed the study. Participants were of both sexes, had to be between the ages of 18 and 65 and had to have been previously diagnosed with plaque psoriasis. The study was conducted over four consultations, two weeks apart, over a six week period. The study followed a double-blind, placebo controlled format. Participants were grouped into matching pairs in terms of age and severity of disease and were then randomly assigned into either the treatment or placebo group for the study duration. Participants were evaluated at each consultation using the three primary assessment tools, namely: the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) used to assess erythema, thickness and scaling of lesions; the psoriasis disability index questionnaire (PDI), a subjective participant-orientated evaluation of the psychological impact of the disease and the 5 -D itch scale used to quantitatively rate the subjective experience of pruritus. The secondary tools used at each consultation were for monitoring purposes only and were used to determine: changes in selected lesion area, as well as the effects of the intervention on the total body surface area (TBSA) affected by psoriasis. The TBSA tool was also used to determine whether new lesions developed during the study period. Using non-parametric analyses, the results of the study demonstrated statistically significant improvement in three of the five variables tested. This includes improvement in: lesion appearance (erythema, scaling and thickness) as determined by PASI; improved psychological experience of the disease quantified by PDI and improvement in the degree of pruritus. It was noted that non-parametric analyses also showed improvement in lesion area. However, lesion area measurement was a secondary tool used for monitoring purposes and it was noted that the use of the tool demonstrated short-comings with regards to consistency and reliability. Parametric analyses showed improvement of statistical significance in one of the five variables tested, namely that of pruritus levels as determined by the 5 -D itch scale. It was concluded from this study that the homoeopathic complex remedy was found to be effective in the treatment of certain symptoms of psoriasis and as such should be considered as an adjunct therapy in its treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{consumption}} {{and production of}} top fermenting beers in South America and Brazil have great increased in the past years. Despite the great biodiversity and production of traditional alcoholic beverages, all Brazilian craft brewers still depend on imported commercial yeast strains {{as a result of}} total lack of information and studies about the use of indigenous strains in brewing. Hence, the costs of buying yeast are high and even more with the greater tendency to produce various beer styles and application of many different strains. From this perspective,this study aimed to selected indigenous South American yeasts able to produce high quality and flavorful top fermented beers. Ninety nine Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild strains, from different regions in South America(from North to South of Brazil, Ecuador and Galapagos Island) all from a variety of niches like environment strains (mainly tree barks) and from different musts of traditional spontaneous beverages with spontaneous fermentation (cachaça, traditional fruit wines, chicha etc.) were tested. Based on the maltose fermentation, 20 S. cerevisiae strains from the 99 tested were characterized with its different killer activity and selected to perform top fermented <b>beers</b> in different <b>scales.</b> Preliminary tests were performed on lab scale where it was evaluated the main fermentation parameters (attenuation degree, alcohol production etc.), fermenting sugars (HPLC) and the main aroma compounds (HS-SPME) produced by each different yeast. Based on these results, 12 strains were selected to perform brewing process on pilot scale. The same parameters described were analyzed, together with sensory analysis. Based on physiological aspects, fermentative capacity and production of desirable flavor compounds and final product, were selected yeasts with great potential and one indigenous strain was selected to be tested on an industrial scale, whereas all described parameters were also followed. In cooperation between Universities and Industry, the first beer with indigenous Brazilian yeast was produced in the facilities of a micro-brewery (Grimor Brewery, Brazil) and was released in the market. In addition to the results with high reproducibility as regards of the fermentation parameters and aroma compounds produced, the beer also was very approved by Brazilian consumers. This work showed {{for the first time the}} use of Brazilian S. cerevisiae strain as starter in the production of flavorfull top fermenting beer with no prior need for adaptations and attending industrial proportions. This may support and commence the building of an innovative beer yeast bank, which so far does not exist in Brazil and undoubtedly provides a basis for diversified beer brewing. This work encourages the greater autonomy to the sector in increasing expanding in the country, with knowledgeable brewing of cost-effective and flavor-rich new craft beers. The attractive results show undoubtedly a support to Brazilian sector and other yeast dependent countries that can point out the unique and high-valued biodiversity in brewing. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from September 22, 2016 - March 22, 2017 Hop aroma in beer {{is related to the}} unique compositional chemistry of the hops used in the brewing process. While the range of these compositions is quite diverse and primarily dependent on hop cultivar¹, other studies have also shown that cultivation, seasonality, harvesting², processing³⁴, and storage practices⁵⁶ contribute to differences in hop composition. However, {{it should be noted that}} the aroma and composition of fresh and processed hops⁷ is different than the subsequent finished beer. This irreconcilable difference that exists between hops and the finished product has been a confounding variable for brewing scientists, in large part due to the complexity and diversity of the compounds that are transferred from hops to beer, but also due to an incomplete understanding of the interactions between these compounds and the aromas they elicit. Of the many compounds found in hops, those belonging to the class known as monoterpene alcohols have consistently been useful indicators of changes in hop aroma due to different brewing practices. Notable differences exist between American and European hops in terms of the types of flavor they contribute to beer. Brewers tend to describe the former as contributing citrusy, fruity and in some instances floral aromas to beer, while the latter are often described as contributing herbal, tobacco, woody, and spicy notes. Single-hop brewing trials were carried out using either American hops (Cascade, Chinook, Centennial, Citra, or Simcoe) or European hops (East Kent Goldings, Hallertau Mittlefrueh HHA or Saaz) to identify hop-derived volatiles that contribute to American hop aroma in beer. The eight resultant beers were evaluated using both sensory and instrumental analyses. The sensory analysis identified Centennial as having the highest piney and green hop aromas, while Citra and Simcoe were characterized as being very fruity, citrusy, and tropical (especially Citra). The Hallertau Mittlefrueh (HHA) beers were similar to the East Kent Goldings, and these two were more floral and rose-like than the Saaz sample with more melon character than the American cultivars. Volatile analysis of the beer samples was performed using a stir-bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) of the beer samples followed by quantification by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In general, the beers brewed with the American hop varieties were higher in aroma and in monoterpene alcohols. In addition to hop oil-derived aroma, previous studies have demonstrated that non-volatile hop-derived precursors, specifically glycosides, survive the boil process and can be hydrolyzed to release volatile aglycones capable of contributing to aroma. To investigate this, twelve single hopped pilot <b>scale</b> <b>beers</b> were brewed using pellet, supercritical extract, and spent hop fractions of Citra, Simcoe, Centennial, or Cascade cultivars in order to investigate the contribution of these different hop fractions to the aroma of kettle hopped beers. The spent hop treatments produced beers that had noticeable, albeit low, hop aroma which suggest that the water-soluble components left behind in the spent hops may contribute to hop aroma. The intensity and nature of the hop aroma in the Spent treatments was hop variety. However, contributions of water soluble components from spent hops to hop aroma in beer was very subtle, especially compared to the pellet and extract treatments. Aqueous extracts of the spent material from pilot scale supercritical CO₂ fluid extraction (SFE) of hop pellets were treated to investigate the impact of different hydrolysis treatments and on the aroma and volatile profile. Aroma profiles were evaluated using descriptive analysis by a trained panel. Volatiles arising from hydrolysis treatments of aqueous extracts of the spent materials were measured using SBSE and GC-MS. The intensity and nature of the hop aroma was treatment specific. Acidic hydrolysis of water soluble extracts produced the most intense Overall and Pine aroma. Differences in the aroma intensities due to the hydrolysis from the addition of different enzyme preparations were present but subtle. Aromas liberated by ale yeast produced different profiles than the lager yeast. All treatments showed increases in aglycone content and changes in aroma profile when treated with hydrolytic enzymes preparations. However, fundamental studies that examine the extraction of glycosides during brewing and their subsequent hydrolysis by yeast have not been fully investigated. Furthermore, extraction of other hop-derived compounds into beer show a strong dependency on the hop cultivar being used and the point at which it is added. Therefore, the extent of glycoside extraction due to hopping regime, cultivar, and their hydrolysis due to yeast β-glucosidase activity was investigated. The glycoside concentration of worts made with three different hopping regimes and three cultivars was measured. Additionally, β-glucosidase activities for 80 different yeast strains and their effect on aglycone concentration in wort was determined. Glycoside content was measured by the difference in volatile aglycone concentrations between samples treated with purified β-glucosidase and untreated samples. Aglycone concentration was measured by SPME GC-MS. Results showed that yeast have a wide range of abilities to hydrolyze glycosides with a maximum hydrolysis occurring after three days of fermentation regardless of yeast activity. Although it was shown that yeast are capable of glycoside hydrolysis, glycoside concentrations in wort are low and have small contributions to hop aroma. These results help explain the extent to which different brewing yeasts and hopping regimes contribute to hoppy beer aroma through the hydrolysis of non-volatile hop-derived compounds. Finally, in order to investigate the effect of hopping regime on the monoterpene alcohol content and sensory attributes of beer, 6 single hop beers were made using different hop additions and evaluated by sensory and instrumental analysis. Beers were brewed while varying two factors: hop cultivar (Simcoe and HHA) and timing of hop addition (60 min. boil, 25 min. whirlpool, or 48 -hour dryhopping). Additionally, the impact of yeast strain on treatment was investigated. Each treatment was compared to an unhopped control using SBSE GC-MS and descriptive sensory analysis. Multivariate statistical analysis were used to described the between relationships between instrumental and sensory results. Whirlpool additions produced beers with the highest concentrations of geraniol, linalool, and β-citronellol; beers brewed with highly aromatic Simcoe hops produced more intense and individually distinct aromas for each hopping regime compared to the HHA hopped beers. Conversely, beers brewed with HHA hops showed less intense aromas with less distinction between hopping regimes, except for the dry-hopped treatment, which was characterized by a more floral type aroma than the other HHA. This research shows that despite the popularity of dry-hopping as an aroma hopping method, whirlpool additions can also produce intensely aromatic beers...|$|R
