5|$|Brooks {{was born}} on 23 February 1876 at Draycott Moor near Faringdon, {{the son of a}} farm labourer. He grew up near Windsor, Berkshire, where his father {{afterwards}} worked in the Great Park, and as a child frequently encountered members of the Royal Family. After leaving school in 1890, he worked as a <b>boy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> estates, where one of his duties was to look after a mule given to Queen Victoria by Lord Kitchener. In 1892 he enlisted in the 3rd Dragoon Guards, and after leaving the army joined the Glamorganshire Yeomanry as a volunteer.|$|E

Growing up in Melbourne, he was educated at Brighton Grammar School and started work at sixteen as a {{messenger}} <b>boy</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> Age, where his mother Caroline edited women's features.

5|$|The {{meeting with}} Fleming led to Hawks's first {{job in the}} film industry, as a prop <b>boy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Douglas Fairbanks film In Again, Out Again (on which Fleming was {{employed}} as the cinematographer) for Famous Players-Lasky. According to Hawks, a new set needed to be built quickly when the studio's set designer was unavailable, so Hawks volunteered {{to do the job}} himself, much to Fairbanks's satisfaction. He was next employed as a prop boy and general assistant on an unspecified film directed by Cecil B. DeMille. (Hawks never named the film in later interviews and DeMille made five films roughly in that time period).|$|E

5|$|In Wonder Boy in Monster Land, players control Wonder Boy as he {{destroys the}} monsters in Monster Land and defeats the MEKA dragon. When the player begins the game, Wonder Boy starts {{out in the}} City of Wonder Land without any items or gold, but {{to give him a}} chance, at the {{beginning}} of the game, the city's mayor gives him a sword and a revival potion and sets him off on his own. The game is divided into twelve levels, and each of them has its own unique features, items, monsters, and secrets. These levels include towns, valleys, deserts, islands, and castles. Players use the D-pad to move Wonder <b>Boy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main screen, to enter doors by pressing upward, and to use Magic Weapons by pressing downward. The D-pad is also used to select between various items when in a shop. Players also have two buttons: one which makes Wonder Boy attack with his sword and buy items in the shop; and one which makes Wonder Boy jump and skip through storylines.|$|E
5|$|Rainfall {{from the}} storm reached over 7inches (175mm) a short {{distance}} east of Pensacola, Florida, though impact in the state was minor. Wind gusts peaked at 38mph (61km/h) in Pensacola. In Alabama, Beryl produced sustained winds of 38mph (61km/h), with gusts to 54mph (86km/h), as well as above normal tides. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in coastal portions of Alabama, peaking at 16.09inches (408mm) on Dauphin Island. Rough waves overturned a shrimp boat in Mobile Bay. A 15-year-old <b>boy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> boat drowned, the only direct fatality {{from the storm}}. The boy's father, also on the boat, spent 24hours in the water before being rescued by the United States Coast Guard. The waves caused severe beach erosion along the coastline, with Dauphin Island losing 60 to 70feet (18 to 21m) of beach.|$|E
5|$|The jurist Richard Posner saw Tripp as {{reviving}} psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing's {{theory that}} masturbation helps to cause homosexuality by fixating a <b>boy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> male genitals, {{based on evidence}} that homosexuals begin masturbating earlier than heterosexuals. Posner criticized the theory {{on the grounds that}} homosexuality and early masturbation could both be effects of whatever factor might be responsible for causing homosexuality. The geneticist Dean Hamer wrote that The Homosexual Matrix was influential and that Tripp provided the clearest articulation of the social learning theory of sexual orientation. However, Hamer found the theory itself implausible, and rejected it on numerous grounds, arguing that it is inconsistent with anthropological evidence and human evolutionary history, and fails to explain the existence of homosexuality.|$|E

25|$|The rescue by the Kerlogue {{has been}} recreated {{in a novel}} entitled, The Lonely Sea and Sky by the Irish poet and novelist, Dermot Bolger, whose father sailed during the war on the Kerlogue’s sister ship, the MV Edenvale.

25|$|Another {{claim was}} {{put forth by}} a young boy who stated {{that he had been}} hit by a small (~3-gram) stone of the Mbale {{meteorite}} fall from Uganda, and who stood to gain nothing from this assertion.

25|$|The pages {{purport to}} be three {{computer}} printouts from Daddy's House, indicating that Wallace was in the studio recording a song called Nasty <b>Boy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> afternoon Shakur was shot. They indicate that Wallace wrote half the session, was In and out/sat around and laid down a ref, shorthand for a reference vocal, {{the equivalent of a}} first take. But nothing indicates when the documents were created. And Louis Alfred, the recording engineer listed on the sheets, {{said in an interview that}} he remembered recording the song with Wallace in a late-night session, not during the day. He could not recall the date of the session but said it was likely not the night Shakur was shot. We would have heard about it, Mr. Alfred said.|$|E

500|$|Squab pie {{has been}} the subject of poetry. In [...] "The Squab-Pie.

A <b>boy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ship goes into town to claim a large squab pie from the bakery for a penny, though it was not meant to be his. Set on a Sunday, the family who had commissioned the pie from the baker, in order to avoid cooking, try to find it, but to no avail. Taylor explains the moral is that if you believe it is a sin to cook on a Sunday, you should not be still having a big meal by getting a baker to cook for you.|$|E
