5|$|Germanicus {{sent some}} troops {{back to the}} Rhine, {{with some of them}} taking the land route, but most of them took the fast route and {{traveled}} by boat. They went down the Ems toward the North Sea, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> reached the sea, a storm struck, sinking many of the boats and killing many men and horses.|$|E

Hichens received a posthumous MID for these actions.|$|E

5|$|A mountainside, at the magician's cavern. Goffredo and Eustazio {{are told}} by the Magician that Almirena is being held captive in Armida's palace at the mountain-top. Ignoring the magician's warning that they will need special powers, the pair set off for the palace but are quickly driven back by Armida's monsters. The magician then gives them magic wands that transcend Armida's power, and they set off again. This time they {{overcome}} the monsters, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> reach {{the gates of the}} palace it disappears, leaving them clinging to a rock {{in the midst of a}} stormy sea. They climb the rock and descend out of sight.|$|E
5|$|Cowpeas {{are grown}} mostly for their edible beans, {{although}} the leaves, green peas and green pea pods {{can also be}} consumed, meaning the cowpea {{can be used as}} a food source before the dried peas are harvested. Like other legumes, cowpea grain is cooked to make it edible, usually by boiling. Cowpeas can be prepared in stews, soups, purees and casseroles, but the most common way to eat them is in curries. They can also be processed into a paste or flour. Chinese long beans can be eaten raw or cooked, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> easily become waterlogged are usually sautéed, stir-fried, or deep-fried.|$|E
5|$|For example, {{near the}} mouth of the Yangtze, the baiji was a princess that had lost her parents and had lived with her step-father, whom she had longed to get away from. The step-father wanted to trade her since she would have been sold for a great sum of money, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were {{crossing}} the river to get to the trader, a storm rolled in, and they were drenched. The step-father, enraged, tried to take her, but she plunged herself into the river. Before being drowned in the river, she was transformed into a dolphin, and swam away from her abusive step-father, who also fell in and was transformed into a porpoise.|$|E

5|$|Hazlitt then {{comments}} {{on some of}} the other characters seen not in isolation <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> interact with and affect one another, comparing and contrasting them to highlight subtle differences. For example, the characters of Goneril and Regan, the comparison of which he begins with a note of personal distaste ("they are so thoroughly hateful that we do not even like to repeat their names"), are shown, he points out, partly in their reaction to their sister Cordelia's desire that they treat their father well—Prescribe not to us our duties—and partly by the contrast of their hypocrisy with the candor of the otherwise evil Edmund.|$|E
5|$|In general, Atlus publishes Megami Tensei {{games in}} Japan and North America, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> lack a European branch, they publish {{titles in the}} region through {{third-party}} companies such as Ghostlight and NIS America. Their latest partnership, after their deal with NIS America ended {{with the publication of}} Odin Sphere Leifthrasir, was with European publishing firm Deep Silver to publish multiple titles in the region, including Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse and Persona 5. Atlus has occasionally published titles digitally in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In {{the palace}} garden Armida prepares to kill Almirena. Rinaldo draws his sword, but Armida is {{protected}} from his wrath by spirits. Suddenly Goffredo and Eustazio arrive, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> touch {{the garden with}} their wands it disappears, leaving them all on an empty plain {{with the city of}} Jerusalem visible in the distance. Armida, after a last attempt to kill Almirena, also disappears as Rinaldo strikes her with his sword. The remaining four celebrate their reunion, while Goffredo announces that the attack on Jerusalem will begin the next day.|$|E

5|$|In the town, Rick and Glenn find Hershel {{alone in}} a tavern, {{drinking}} and lamenting {{the loss of his}} family members. Rick eventually convinces Hershel to return, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are about to leave, two men from Philadelphia enter the bar—Dave (Michael Raymond-James) and Tony (Aaron Munoz). They reveal that Rick's goal of Fort Benning may be overridden and try to goad where the group's farm is, looking for safe haven. Rick refuses to disclose the farm's location, and shoots them both before they fire back on him.|$|E
5|$|In {{view of this}} interest, Darwin {{prepared}} a paper on Catasetum as an extract from his forthcoming book, which was read to the Linnean Society of London on 3 April 1862. Darwin solved the puzzle by showing that the three flowers were the male, female, and hermaphrodite forms of a single species, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> differed so much from each other, they had been classified as different genera.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's {{publications}} {{were rarely}} luxury goods: he priced his merchandise competitively, but always within {{the reach of}} the middle class, the audience he most wanted to serve. One way that he reduced costs was by printing texts in the provinces and then importing them to London; many of Priestley's works, for example, were printed locally in Birmingham. Johnson did not take great care with the printing of many of his books; they are full of errors and poorly bound. <b>But</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were often printed extremely quickly to respond to a particular event, this was expected by his contemporaries.|$|E

5|$|Lewis Wendell Willkie {{was born}} in Elwood, Indiana, on February 18, 1892, the son of Henrietta (Trisch) and Herman Francis Willkie. Both of his parents were lawyers, his mother {{being one of the}} first women {{admitted}} to the Indiana bar. His father {{was born in}} Germany and his mother was born in Indiana, to German parents; his grandparents were involved in the unsuccessful 1848 revolutions in Germany. The Trisches initially settled in Kansas Territory <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were abolitionists, moved to Indiana after the territory was opened to slavery in the mid-1850s. Willkie was the fourth of six children, all intelligent, and learned skills during the nightly debates around the dinner table that would later serve him well.|$|E
5|$|Most Hydrophiinae are {{completely}} aquatic and {{have adapted to}} their environments in many ways, the most characteristic {{of which is a}} paddle-like tail that has improved their swimming ability. To a varying degree, the bodies of many species are laterally compressed, especially in the pelagic species. This has often caused the ventral scales to become reduced in size, even difficult to distinguish from the adjoining scales. Their lack of ventral scales means they have become virtually helpless on land, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> live out their entire lifecycles at sea, they have no need to leave the water.|$|E
5|$|Part Two {{introduces}} Laila. She {{is a girl}} {{growing up}} in Kabul who is close friends with Tariq, a boy living in her neighborhood. They eventually develop a romantic relationship despite being aware of the social boundaries {{between men and women}} in Afghan society. War comes to Afghanistan, and Kabul is bombarded by rocket attacks. Tariq's family decides to leave the city, and the emotional farewell between Laila and Tariq culminates with them making love. Laila's family also decides to leave Kabul, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are packing a rocket destroys the house, killing her parents and severely injuring Laila. Laila is subsequently taken in by Rasheed and Mariam.|$|E

5|$|Similar {{but later}} rumours {{included}} that {{during her first}} voyage, Centaur had transported soldiers to New Guinea, or Japanese prisoners of war back to Australia for interrogation, and consequently had been marked as a legitimate target by the Japanese.

5|$|The Parson is {{a feisty}} and {{energetic}} type of Terrier. They can excel in dog {{sports such as}} flyball or agility and require vigorous exercise {{in order to prevent}} them from becoming bored and potentially destructive in the home. They can be suited to live with children <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> have a typical Terrier temperament, they will not tolerate rough handling. The AKC describes them as being single minded, tenacious and courageous when at work, while at home they can be exuberant, playful and affectionate. However, it is unusual for dogs of this breed to be involved in work, such as fox hunting, typical of a small white terrier, as they are more adapted to the show bench.|$|E

The drop was almost a total success, with the majority of the raiding force landing {{on the edge of the}} drop zone; however, half of the 'Nelson' detachment landed two miles short of the DZ. Once the other detachments had gathered their equipment and orientated themselves, they moved off to undertake their arranged tasks.|$|E
