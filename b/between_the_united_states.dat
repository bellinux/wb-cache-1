5|$|During {{the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries, the area's legal and {{political}} status was disputed. The Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary War in 1783, had defined the northern border <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and Canada based on the inaccurate Mitchell Map. Ownership of the area between Lake of the Woods and Lake Superior was unclear, with the United States claiming the border was further north at the Kaministiquia River and Canada claiming it was further south beginning at the Saint Louis River. In 1842, the Webster–Ashburton Treaty clarified the border <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and Canada using the old trading route running along the Pigeon River and Rainy River (today the BWCAW's northern border).|$|E

5|$|Fellows {{is among}} the {{earliest}} cases where the Supreme Court applied treaties, including treaties <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and Native American tribes, as binding law. Fellows has been cited as authority for the enrolled treaty doctrine; analogous to the enrolled bill rule for statutes, the enrolled treaty doctrine prevents inquiry into {{the legitimacy of the}} formation of treaties once ratified by the Senate. This doctrine was later used to deny relief (or, to deny more relief) to Native American tribes who claimed that treaties were entered into fraudulently or signed by persons without authority to bind the tribe. Fellows was also decided before the Supreme Court began distinguishing between self-executing and non-self executing treaties. Regardless, treaties <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and Native Americans continued to be regarded as self-executing.|$|E
