In this case it is not always necessary to transfer into a deck chamber, as the <b>bell</b> <b>is</b> quite capable of performing this function, though it would be relatively cramped, as a <b>bell</b> <b>is</b> usually as small as conveniently possible to minimize weight for deployment.|$|E

A thirteenth <b>bell</b> <b>was</b> added in 2013 which allows beginners to practice with a full octave, without having to use the four heaviest <b>bells.</b> The <b>bells</b> <b>are</b> rung on Sundays before the morning and evening services, and also for weddings and other special occasions.|$|R

The bells were to be {{displayed}} and rung on patriotic occasions. Many of the bells today are sited near state capitol buildings.

Struck with mallets, they produced both tap and hum tone. But Parsifal presented a particular problem because the lowest of the Golden Legend <b>bells</b> <b>was</b> a minor tenth higher than the lowest note required for Parsifal, and the aggregate weight of the four <b>bells</b> <b>was</b> thousands of pounds.|$|R

The original <b>bells</b> <b>were</b> hung from a large nearby tree for some fifteen years, until the chapel <b>bell</b> tower <b>was</b> completed in 1791.

5|$|Finally, the {{flared end}} {{is known as}} the bell. Contrary to popular belief, the bell does not amplify the sound; rather, it {{improves}} the uniformity of the instrument's tone for the lowest notes in each register. For the other notes the sound is produced almost entirely at the tone holes and the <b>bell</b> <b>is</b> irrelevant. On basset horns and larger clarinets, the bell curves up and forward and is usually made of metal.|$|E

5|$|Japanese temple bells are struck {{externally}} {{with either}} a hammer or a suspended beam rather than with an internal clapper. The sound of the <b>bell</b> <b>is</b> made up of three parts. First is the atari, {{the impact of the}} strike. A well-made bell should produce a clean, clear tone. The initial sound of the strike is immediately followed by the prolonged oshi, the reverberation that continues to sound after the <b>bell</b> <b>is</b> struck. This is higher in pitch and is a low rumble with a sorrowful air, rich in harmonics; it lasts for up to ten seconds. Finally comes the okuri or decay, the resonance that is heard as the vibration of the bell dies away, which can last up to a minute. There are also continuous harmonic overtones heard throughout the tolling of the bell. These multiple tones create a complex pitch profile.|$|E
5|$|The Illinois Freedom <b>Bell</b> <b>is</b> {{located in}} Mount Morris, Illinois, United States, {{and is the}} {{official}} freedom bell of the U.S. state of Illinois. The bell was created for a church in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin as {{a replica of the}} Liberty Bell in 1862. In 1910, while it was being moved across the frozen Geneva Lake following a fire at the church, the ice cracked and the bell sank {{to the bottom of the}} lake. It was salvaged in 1960 and the village of Mount Morris acquired it in 1966. The Illinois Freedom <b>Bell</b> <b>is</b> rung during the annual Let Freedom Ring festival, and it can be found beneath a gazebo on the village square. The bell has been credited with starting an Independence Day bell-ringing tradition across the United States. The bell was designated the official Illinois Freedom Bell in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The {{fittings}} {{are from}} the late 19th century, although the octagonal font (made of gritstone) is of uncertain date, possibly 14th century. The <b>bell</b> <b>is</b> dated 1647.
