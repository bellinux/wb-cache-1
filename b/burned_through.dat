5|$|In 1978, Bonfire {{shifted to}} a wedding-cake style, in which upper stacks of logs were wedged {{on top of}} lower stacks. The {{structure}} was built around a fortified centerpole, made from two telephone poles. Although tradition stated that if Bonfire <b>burned</b> <b>through</b> midnight A would win the following day's game, {{with the introduction of}} the wedding cake design Bonfire began to fall quickly, sometimes burning for only 30 or 45 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The Great Fire of New York was {{a devastating}} fire that <b>burned</b> <b>through</b> {{the night of}} September 20, 1776, and into the morning of September 21, on the West Side of what then {{constituted}} New York City {{at the southern end}} of the island of Manhattan. It broke out in the early days of the military occupation of the city by British forces during the American Revolutionary War.|$|E
5|$|At about 8:30am {{the wooden}} {{construction}} of {{the main part of}} the building also <b>burned</b> <b>through</b> and collapsed. Despite the fact that there were still people in the building and more people were lying around the building severely injured, the fire fighters decided to withdraw. The fire department proceeded to extinguish the smoking debris, and at 9:30am the fire was declared under control. The building's collapse left a gaping hole; of the hotel, the furniture store and the book store, almost nothing remained.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{incendiary}} bombs usually contain thermite, {{made from}} aluminium and ferric oxide. It takes very high temperatures to ignite, but when alight, it can <b>burn</b> <b>through</b> solid steel. In World War II, such devices {{were employed in}} incendiary grenades to <b>burn</b> <b>through</b> heavy armor plate, or as a quick welding mechanism to destroy artillery and other complex machined weapons.|$|R

5|$|Prior to the 1940s, {{wildfires}} <b>burned</b> <b>through</b> the Little Applegate River watershed frequently. The United States Forest Service began {{fire suppression}} {{efforts in the}} 1920s, and a smokejumper station was built about 20 years later. Species that depend on fire to reproduce—such as ponderosa pine—declined in population, while Douglas-fir and white fir spread. Buckbrush and manzanita, normally chaparral plants, encroached on the oak savanna regions. The vegetation in the watershed continues to grow denser, making it more susceptible to insect infestations and disease.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} {{exploding}} cigars were being turned out by manufacturers such as Adams and Appel, the chemical explosive variety {{had fallen out}} of favor. According to Adams, the large-scale switch to a non-chemical device occurred in approximately 1915 {{in the aftermath of a}} death caused by a homemade exploding cigar rigged with dynamite. Though exploding cigars were not normally rigged with dynamite but with explosive caps using a less powerful incendiary, following the incident, a number of U.S. states banned the product altogether. The replacement for chemical explosives was a metal spring mechanism, bound with cord—as the victim puffed away, the cord <b>burned</b> <b>through,</b> causing the device to spring open, thus rupturing the cigar's end.|$|E
5|$|On 28 March 2003 the {{pavilion}} at the pierhead caught fire. Fire crews {{were unable to}} save the building from destruction because the collapsed walkway prevented them from reaching it. The cause of the fire remains unknown, since fire investigators were unable to access the site for safety reasons, although it {{is thought to have}} been arson. A more severe fire <b>burned</b> <b>through</b> 11 and 12 May 2003, consuming most of {{what was left of the}} concert hall. On 23 June 2004, high winds caused the middle of the pier to collapse completely. The following month, English Heritage declared the pier to be beyond repair.|$|E

5|$|It {{took five}} {{minutes for the}} pad workers to open all three hatch layers, and they could not drop the inner hatch to the cabin floor as intended, so they pushed {{it out of the}} way to one side. Although the cabin lights {{remained}} lit, they were at first unable to find the astronauts through the dense smoke. As the smoke cleared, they found the bodies, but were not able to remove them. The fire had partly melted Grissom's and White's nylon space suits and the hoses connecting them to the life support system. Grissom had removed his restraints and was lying on the floor of the spacecraft. White's restraints were <b>burned</b> <b>through,</b> and he was found lying sideways just below the hatch. It was determined that he had tried to open the hatch per the emergency procedure, but was not able to do so against the internal pressure. Chaffee was found strapped into his right-hand seat, as procedure called for him to maintain communication until White opened the hatch. Because of the large strands of melted nylon fusing the astronauts to the cabin interior, removing the bodies took nearly 90 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The end {{came first}} for Virginia. Because the {{blockade}} was unbroken, Norfolk was of little strategic {{use to the}} Confederacy, and preliminary plans were laid to move the ship up the James River to the vicinity of Richmond. Before adequate preparations could be made, the Confederate Army under Major General Benjamin Huger abandoned the city on May 9, without consulting anyone from the Navy. Virginias draft was too great to permit her to pass up the river, which had a depth of only , and then only under favorable circumstances. She was trapped and could only be captured or sunk by the Union Navy. Rather than allow either, Tatnall decided to destroy his own ship. He had her towed down to Craney Island in Portsmouth, where the gang were taken ashore, {{and then she was}} set afire. She <b>burned</b> <b>through</b> {{the rest of the day}} and most of the following night; shortly before dawn, the flames reached her magazine, and she blew up.|$|E

50|$|The {{disaster}} drew unfortunate {{comparisons to}} the Challenger shuttle accident three months earlier, {{which was also}} {{the victim of a}} solid rocket motor malfunction. However, the Titan incident was found to have a rather different cause as it had not suffered O-ring <b>burn</b> <b>through,</b> but instead the culprit was a small air pocket between the SRM propellant and its metal motor casing. This allowed hot exhaust gases to <b>burn</b> <b>through</b> the casing and eventually rupture the SRM. The loss of two photoreconnaissance satellites in a row also badly hampered US efforts to acquire intelligence on Soviet activities.|$|R
25|$|Goddard {{experimented with}} many of the {{features}} of today's large rockets, such as multiple combustion chambers and nozzles. In November, 1936, he flew the world's first rocket (L-7) with multiple chambers, hoping to increase thrust without increasing the size of a single chamber. It had four combustion chambers, reached a height of 200 feet, and corrected its vertical path using blast vanes until one chamber <b>burned</b> <b>through.</b> This flight demonstrated that a rocket with multiple combustion chambers could fly stably and be easily guided.|$|E
25|$|Clara Clarita {{came into}} the {{possession}} of the New York Harbor Protective Company in 1870, when she was converted into a fireboat. In August 1870, Clara Clarita was towing a burning ferryboat out of harm's way when the tow rope <b>burned</b> <b>through,</b> allowing the ferry to collide with a schooner {{and set it on}} fire. In a later landmark ruling, the courts ruled that although the damage was caused by the ferry not the tug, and {{regardless of whether or not}} the schooner was anchored improperly, the tug was still at fault through negligently using a rope rather than a chain to tow the ferry.|$|E

On 3 July Anne Galley arrived at Deptford Dockyard for fitting {{out as a}} fire ship. Conversion {{to the role of}} fire ship involverd the {{construction}} of compartments in her hold for the storage of gunpowder and other combustible materials, and the cutting of a series of small chimneys into her deck to help ventilate fires set below. The eight lower deck gun ports had their hinges changed so they would fall open when their supporting ropes had <b>burned</b> <b>through,</b> further fanning any flames. Lastly, she received eight ½-pounder swivel guns along the upper deck railings for anti-personnel use.|$|E
