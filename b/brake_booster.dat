50|$|Rotary-vane {{pumps are}} also a common type of vacuum pump, with {{two-stage}} pumps able to reach pressures well below 10−6 bar. These vacuum pumps are found in numerous applications, such as providing braking assistance in large trucks and diesel-powered passenger cars (whose engines do not generate intake vacuum) through a <b>braking</b> <b>booster,</b> in most light aircraft to drive gyroscopic flight instruments, in evacuating refrigerant lines during installation of air conditioners, in laboratory freeze dryers, and vacuum experiments in physics. In the vane pump, the pumped gas and the oil are mixed within the pump, and so they must be separated externally. Therefore, the inlet and the outlet have a large chamber, maybe with swirl, where the oil drops {{fall out of the}} gas. Sometimes the inlet has a venetian blind cooled by the room air (the pump is usually 40 K hotter) to condense cracked pumping oil and water, and let it drop back into the inlet. When these pumps are used in high-vacuum systems (where the inflow of gas into the pump becomes very low), a significant concern is contamination of the entire system by molecular oil backstreaming.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> is an {{enhanced}} master cylinder setup {{used to reduce}} the amount of pedal pressure needed for braking. It employs a booster set up to act with the master cylinder to give higher hydraulic pressure to the brakes and/or lower force applied on the brake pedal through a <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> push-rod. The <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> usually uses vacuum from the engine intake to boost the force applied by the pedal on to the master cylinder, or may employ an extra vacuum pump to enable it. Without the engine running the brake pedal feels very hard and ineffective on the braking capability. An [...] "active" [...] booster is a non [...] "conventional" [...] booster where a solenoid is used to open the booster air valve to automatically push the master cylinder forward to perform some forms of dynamic stability control.

40|$|Aim of {{this work}} is the {{development}} of a lumped parameters simulation model of single-vane vacuum pumps for pneumatically actuated <b>brake</b> <b>boosters.</b> Kinematic and fluid-dynamic models are integrated in a simulation environment to create a tool aimed at evaluating the vacuum pump performance and at guiding the designer during the prototype development. The paper describes extensively the mathematical model, the time domain simulation and experimental analyses performed on a camshaft mounted unit. Great emphasis is placed on the evaluation of the geometric quantities of the control volumes into which the vacuum pump has been divided. For each control volume the mass and energy conservation equations lead to the determination of the instantaneous pressure. The volume of each variable chamber and the respective angular derivative are calculated as function of the shaft position starting from the stator track profile supplied as a generic closed polyline. Flow areas between each chamber and the inlet/outlet volumes during a complete shaft revolution are evaluated directly from a data file containing the x-y coordinates of the passage area contour. Different leakage paths are also taken into account. Specific attention is dedicated to the simulation of the lubricating fluid throughout the vacuum pump in order to take into account possible overpressures due to the presence of a trapped volume of oil, above all during cold starts. To achieve this target the equations describing the behavior of the liquid and gaseous phases are applied simultaneously and the current fraction of oil is evaluated for each variable volume chamber. The model is able to work with an oil fraction ranging from 0 % to 100 % without introducing discontinuities in the differential equations. Experimental tests have confirmed a good matching with the simulation results in terms of pressure vs. time characteristics and absorbed torque...|$|R
