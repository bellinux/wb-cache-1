5|$|The episode ends when Stanley (Leslie David Baker) {{attempts}} to get a cookie from a blood drive nurse at the drive by claiming he gave blood earlier and showing a cotton ball taped to his arm as proof. The nurse recognizes he is lying because they are using band-aids; a frustrated Stanley leaves, and tells Phyllis, {{who is about to}} try the same trick. In the final scene, Creed (Creed Bratton) is seen leaving the blood mobile with a bag of donated <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> coat pocket.|$|E

When Ed arrives, Scully tells him that they found <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> neighbor's apartment and that it was likely his. She thinks that the chemical came from the tattoo ink and wants them both to head to the hospital to be tested. Ed tells Scully about the voice he has been hearing from his tattoo.|$|E

5|$|The {{conventions}} of Moonlight are based, in part, on a unique mythology. Some {{parts of the}} mythology that are common include a sire, that is the vampire who turns a human into a vampire; though in the show the sire must teach him or her how to live as one. A vampire's bite {{is not enough to}} turn a human into a vampire; the human, when near death, must drink the sire's blood or have vampire <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> or her system at the moment of death. The process of vampirization also affects their genetics, causing their DNA to be fundamentally altered to suit their bodies' new state. This makes genetic testing between vampires and their human relatives impossible unless the vampire has a sample of their own human DNA from before they were turned, such as a lock of hair. They must consume human blood to survive. They also develop psychic powers and can glimpse the future and the past. This ability, along with their night vision, is an extension of their heightened senses. Daylight does not kill vampires, but does make them progressively weaker. Silver and fire are toxic, whereas garlic, holy water and crucifixes are useless. A vampire's image cannot be captured with analogue cameras containing silver emulsion in the film; digital cameras are able to capture an image because they do not use silver emulsion. Though undead, vampires have a pulse, are not cold blooded (but still don't produce body heat as seen in episode 11 so as heat signature cameras won't see them), and cannot turn into a bat. The best ways to kill them are by decapitation or burning; a stake through the heart is painful but only causes paralysis. Moonlight vampires have many of the preternatural abilities as described in vampire mythology; they have superhuman strength and speed, they heal rapidly from any wound, they can defy gravity to a limited degree to perform parkour feats, their bite has hypnotic effects on weak-minded humans, and they are immortal. Their powers increase as they get older. Their blood has drug-like affects when consumed by humans; causing euphoria and temporarily heightened senses.|$|E

25|$|Patient G.D. was a {{white male}} born in 1940 {{who served in the}} Navy. He was {{diagnosed}} with chronic renal failure and received hemodialysis treatment {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1983, he went to the hospital for elective parathyroidectomy. He also had a left thyroid lobectomy because of the severe loss of <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> left lobe. He began having cardiac problems as a result of the surgery and became very agitated. Even five days after being released from the hospital he was unable to remember what had happened to him. Aside from memory impairment, none of his other cognitive processes seemed to be affected. He did not want to be involved in much research, but through memory tests he took with doctors, they were able to ascertain that his memory problems were present for the next 9.5 years until his death. After he died, his brain was donated to science, photographed, and preserved for future study.|$|E
25|$|On 6 April 2012, Darchinyan lost to WBC bantamweight {{champion}} Shinsuke Yamanaka in Yamanaka's {{home country}} of Japan. The fight {{was not without}} controversy. Darchinyan was slightly ahead on one card {{and the other two}} were even after the fourth round. In the fourth, a clash of heads opened a bloody cut on Darchinyan's eyebrow and nose. Yamanaka hit Darchinyan with an elbow on the same eyebrow in round five, severing the cut. The referee was not in line of sight to see this. Blood was pouring more rapidly out of Darchinyan's eyebrow afterward and the ringside doctor examined it. A fight would usually be stopped and given a technical decision at this point, but the cut was controversially ruled to have been caused by a punch by the ringside doctor, who examined the cut in the sixth round, when Darchinyan was ahead on points. Darchinyan, fighting with <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes {{for the rest of the}} fight, lost via decision. The headbutt and elbow thrown by Yamanaka had raised much controversy, as Darchinyan was winning the fight beforehand and his performance seemed to slow down as consequence. The result is currently being protested by Team Darchinyan with photographic proof Yamanaka used an illegal headbutt and elbow.|$|E

25|$|In 1894, Boyce {{was elected}} to the Idaho state senate as a Populist from Shoshone County, Idaho. Boyce battled for the eight-hour day for miners, the {{establishment}} of an arbitration board to settle labor disputes, and an investigation of the 1892 mining war. He objected to appropriations for the state militia, charging that it was a tool used by the state and mine owners to suppress labor. He called for legislation to forbid employment of aliens, to outlaw yellow-dog contracts and prohibit company stores. In {{one of the most dramatic}} speeches he ever made, Boyce denounced the blacklist:Senate bill fifty six provides for no class, no special legislation, but under its provisions those relentless persecutors, known as corporations, are prevented when they discharge an employee from following him with a blacklist and depriving him of the means of earning an honest living in another part of the stateâ¦.Why do you not produce some argument against it to show that it should not become a law? No, it is not necessary: you of the Republican party have the votes to kill the bill and that is all you desire. But remember these words: the laboring men of Idaho have asked you for bread and you give them a stone: we ask you for justice and you treat us with scorn, but the day is fast approaching when your action will be condemned by every man who has one drop of manly <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> veins.|$|E
25|$|Following this defeat, Aerts regained some of {{the weight}} {{that he had lost}} for his match against dreadlocked karate man Ewerton Teixeira at the K-1 World Grand Prix 2010 in Seoul Final 16 on October 2, 2010. A close match, it was decided by an extra round {{unanimous}} decision (10-9, 10-9, 10-9) in favour of Aerts who then qualified for the K-1 World Grand Prix 2010 Final on December 11. In his 17th appearance at the K-1 WGP, he defeated Mighty Mo by first-round KO in the quarter-finals. In the semi-finals, he {{came face to face with}} his archrival Semmy Schilt, in a fight where he was a huge underdog due to his age and Schilt's success in the 2009 Grand Prix. After being cut above the eye and finishing the fight with a swollen face, Aerts won a brilliantly fought decision. However, he had taken a lot of damage in the fight with Schilt and started to cough up <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> changing room after the fight. He was overwhelmed by a less damaged and much fitter and bigger Alistair Overeem and lost by first-round TKO. Though he was defeated, he broke three world records in K-1: He became the oldest man (at 40 years old) to ever make it to the K-1 World Grand Prix Final, he marked the most amount of appearances (6) that any fighter had ever made it to the Final, and also became the first person to ever beat Semmy Schilt in a tournament.|$|E

500|$|Weddle and Thompson {{also worked}} {{extensively}} {{on the scene in}} which Admiral Adama tries to provoke Col. Tigh into killing him. [...] Moore encouraged Weddle and Thompson to give the Adama character progressively crueler lines. The writers were the ones who inserted the line in the script in which Adama mentions Ellen Tigh's sexual infidelity. On the set, however, actor Edward James Olmos changed the line from Adama saying Ellen wanted a man with [...] "real <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> veins" [...] to [...] "main vein," [...] then ad-libbed the line in which the character said, [...] "I could smell her." [...] The scenes where Dualla finds the set of jacks and where Laura Roslin holds the plant cutting were added by director Michael Nankin. Weddle notes that although Nankin usually peppers his writers with script notes, he did not do so for this script.|$|E

500|$|Welensky {{was born}} in Pioneer Street, Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia. His father, Michael Welensky (b. c. 1843), was of Lithuanian Jewish origin, hailing from a village near Wilno (today Vilnius); a trader in Russia and horse-smuggler during the Franco-Prussian War, he settled in Southern Rhodesia after first emigrating to the United States, {{where he was a}} saloon-keeper, and then South Africa. His mother, Leah (born Aletta Ferreira; c. 1865â1918), was a ninth-generation Afrikaner of Dutch ancestry. His parents, for whom Raphael or [...] "Roy" [...] was the 13th child, kept a [...] "poor white" [...] {{boarding}} house. Welensky's mother died when he was 11, being treated by Godfrey Huggins, a doctor who was later to become the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia. Although not of British ancestry, Welensky was intensely pro-British, a distinctive sentiment among Rhodesians. John Connell, in his foreword to Welensky's book 4000 Days, wrote: [...] "Welensky, who had not a drop of British <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> veins, shared this pride and loyalty [...] to the full." ...|$|E
500|$|Literary critic Jean-Marie ApostolidÃ¨s of Stanford University {{believed}} that The Broken Ear established a [...] "tintinian" [...] anthropology that would remain {{throughout the rest}} of the series. As part of this, ApostolidÃ¨s argued, HergÃ© distances himself from western values and looks at his own society as an outsider, accomplishing what Roger Caillois called [...] "sociological revolution". He felt that the comic was [...] "more contrived" [...] and [...] "more superficial" [...] than the previous Adventures, and that here Tintin loses his position as [...] "the sole point of identification" [...] for the reader, with the other characters becoming more identifiable. Opining that there was a constant theme of twos throughout the story (i.e. the real and the fake fetish, Alonso and RamÃ³n), he thought that the character of Ridgewell was [...] "a kind of Tintin, grown old among the natives, solitary and ill humored", noting that Ridgewell's position among the Arumbayas was akin to Tintin's position among the Ba Baorom in Congo. ApostolidÃ¨s also argued that in the comic, Alcazar was a religious figure, who attained a [...] "sacred" [...] quality through the spilling of <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> revolt against General Tapioca's government. As part of this, he argued that the threats of assassination would make him a martyr, or a [...] "holy king." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{retired in}} 2006. He spent nearly 45years in the Army but called it [...] "a regret" [...] {{that he never}} fought in a {{conventional}} battleâhaving been in a staff position in 1982 during the Falklands War and serving as a brigade commander in Northern Ireland during the Gulf War. He said that [...] "Fighting is what {{a young man with}} good red <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> veins joins for. It is the ultimate test for the professional soldier". He has continued to voice opinions on military matters in his retirement. He delivered the annual Richard Dimbleby Lecture four months after leaving the Army. In the lecture, titled The Defence of The Realm in the 21st Century, he criticised the Ministry of Defence and questioned the MoD's understanding of the fundamental ethos of the armed forces. He was critical of the treatment of soldiers, calling some soldiers' accommodation [...] "frankly shaming" [...] and saying that the [...] "Armed Forces' contract with the nation... must be a two-way one", going on to say that [...] "military operations cost in blood and treasure, because risk-free soldiering, which some seem to think is possible, is simply a contradiction in terms". The MoD responded by saying that [...] "while we do not agree with everything Sir Mike has said, we are always the first to recogniseâfor example in relation to medical services and accommodationâthat although we have delivered real improvements, there is more we can do".|$|E
