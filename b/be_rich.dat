5|$|Kilve has {{the remains}} of a red-brick retort built in 1924 after the shale in the cliffs was found to <b>be</b> <b>rich</b> in oil. Along this coast, the cliffs are layered with {{compressed}} strata of oil-bearing shale and blue, yellow and brown Lias embedded with fossils. The Shaline Company was founded in 1924 to exploit these strata but was unable to raise sufficient capital. The company's retort house is thought to be the first structure erected here for the conversion of shale to oil and is all that remains of the anticipated Somerset oil boom.|$|E

The atmosphere also contains hydrogen gas, which is cycling through the atmosphere and the surface environment, and which living things comparable to Earth methanogens could combine with some of the organic compounds (such as acetylene) to obtain energy.|$|E

They argue students should be taught how to become business owners instead of learning how to go work for another company. Trump and Kiyosaki write that such students are instructed to achieve academic excellence through avoiding risk.

25|$|Why We Want You to <b>Be</b> <b>Rich</b> {{notes in}} the {{introduction}} it is not intended as a technical manual with specific recommendations. The book warns the reader that the American middle class strata is shrinking due to multiple factors including oncoming retirement of the baby boomers, rising costs of light crude oil, decreasing employer pay to employees, increasing national debt of the United States, and a declining power of the United States dollar. The authors caution that individuals should not rely on the federal bureaucracy for support from problems including the middle-class squeeze, economic globalization, and threats of terrorism. They assert that employment opportunities are not formed from the government but rather through entrepreneurship.|$|E
25|$|Earth's {{surface is}} very {{depleted}} in the element iridium, which primarily {{resides in the}} Earth's core. The only significant source of the element at the surface is cosmic particles that reach Earth.

An iridium anomaly has been discovered {{at the base of}} the cap carbonate formations, and has been used to suggest that the glacial episode lasted for at least 3 million years, but this does not necessarily imply a global extent to the glaciation; indeed, a similar anomaly could be explained by the impact of a large meteorite.|$|E
