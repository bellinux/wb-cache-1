5|$|Fra Mauro is a {{widespread}} hilly geological area covering large portions of the lunar surface around Mare Imbrium, and {{is thought to be}} composed of ejecta from the impact which formed Imbrium. The area is primarily composed of relatively low ridges and hills, between which exist undulating valleys.
