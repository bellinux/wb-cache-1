5|$|Construction on the <b>Baths</b> of Caracalla {{began in}} 211 {{at the start}} of Caracalla's rule. The <b>baths</b> are named for Caracalla, though it is most {{probable}} that his father was responsible for their planning. In 216 a partial inauguration of the <b>baths</b> took place, but the outer perimeter of the <b>baths</b> was not completed until the reign of Severus Alexander. These large <b>baths</b> were typical of the Roman practice of building complexes for social and state activities in large densely populated cities. The <b>baths</b> covered around 50 acres (or 202,000 square meters) of land and could accommodate around 1,600 bathers at any one time. They were the second largest public <b>baths</b> built in ancient Rome and were complete with swimming pools, exercise yards, a stadium, steam rooms, libraries, meeting rooms, fountains, and other amenities, all of which were enclosed within formal gardens. The interior spaces were decorated with colourful marble floors, columns, mosaics, and colossal statuary.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Baths</b> of Zeuxippus {{were popular}} public <b>baths</b> {{in the city}} of Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire. They were built between 100 to 200, {{destroyed}} by the Nika revolt of 532 and then rebuilt several years later. They were so called because they were built upon the site where a Temple of Jupiter (Zeus) had formerly existed. They were built around 500 yards south of the much older <b>baths</b> of Achilles of the earlier Greek Acropolis in Byzantion. The <b>baths</b> were famed primarily for the many statues that were built within, and the famous people they each represented. However, they were later used for military purposes, during the seventh century. Excavations of the site and the <b>Baths</b> were made in 1928.|$|E

5|$|The {{popularity}} of the <b>Baths</b> of Zeuxippus was very great among the citizens, despite the numerous number of <b>baths</b> that had been available for public access {{at the time in}} Constantinople, and therefore, the great competition that existed in that commercial area.

50|$|An {{alternative}} <b>bath</b> {{model is}} a spin <b>bath.</b> At low temperature and weak system-bath coupling these two <b>bath</b> models are equivalent.
