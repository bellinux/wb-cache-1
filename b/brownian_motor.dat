50|$|In biology, many protein-based {{molecular}} motors in {{the cell}} {{may in fact be}} Brownian motors. These molecular motors convert the chemical energy present in ATP into mechanical energy. One example of a <b>Brownian</b> <b>motor</b> would be an ATPase motor that hydrolyzes ATP to generate fluctuating anisotropic energetic potentials. The anisotropic potentials along the path would bias the motion of a particle (like an ion or polypeptide); the result would essentially be diffusion of a particle whose net motion is strongly biased in one direction. The translocation of the particle would only be loosely coupled to hydrolysis of ATP.|$|E

50|$|<b>Brownian</b> <b>motors</b> are {{nano-scale}} or molecular devices {{by which}} thermally activated processes (chemical reactions) are controlled {{and used to}} generate directed motion in space and to do mechanical or electrical work.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{three models}} of Brownian motors which convert rotational diffusion into directed translational motion by switching {{on and off}} a potential. In the first model a spatially asymmetric potential generates directed translational motion by rectifying rotational diffusion. It behaves much like a conventional flashing ratchet.
