500|$|Brewer told a Channel 5 website writer {{that the}} rain was the biggest {{challenge}} of the night shoot, as it was [...] "beyond freezing". She also revealed that she ran in shoes {{that she had not}} broken in and they made her feet bleed. The actress added [...] "It was incredibly stressful <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> was stress in a good way. There were months of preparation involved so that it could run like clockwork. So I guess it was stressful in the sense the emotional stakes were heightened for a two-week period. It was exhausting and I think we can all say we were happy once it was over. But the final result was worth it." [...] McGregor filmed his final scene out of sequence at the Melbourne studios. He explained that they had already shot Mark's last scene on location, then went back inside to do the studio shots. He revealed [...] "The final thing I filmed was a conversation between Mark and Kyle, where they're saying goodbye. It was a bit sad, but it was basically just these two guys hugging each other – with the cast and crew watching!" ...|$|E
500|$|While {{working at}} the studio, Herren met Joshua Kay and Romulo del Castillo, two Miami-based {{producers}} who had founded Schematic Records, a label known for IDM. Herren recorded and composed music on his MPC and manipulated it to fit Schematic's aesthetic. While {{working at the}} recording studio, Herren felt that the hip hop musicians coming in had very trite lyrics, and felt he could use them for his own Prefuse 73 material. For Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, Herren sampled more famous hip hop records by artists including Nas, Ol' Dirty Bastard and Erykah Badu. Herren stated that he used some of his favorite MCs instead of the musicians he worked with, as he felt these artists were [...] "saying totally relevant stuff, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> was just my excitement to make it happen. But a vocal doesn't have to say anything. Why not challenge people's imagination and let it say whatever they want it to?" [...] For Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, Herren created the music using two turntables plugged into his MPC. To create the glitch sounds through the MPC, Herren switched between different sample sources by instantaneously silencing groups of audio channels at the same time.|$|E
2500|$|Mankind {{is known}} to be narrow-minded, so... maybe some [...] <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> will even out the score in a way. I think it will be {{positive}} for some and negative for some. It's always good to have some negative as well. Otherwise you would end up with equality and equality is the worst thing in the world. Equality is stagnation. It doesn't let anything grow. It holds back.|$|E
6000|$|... "My eye's pretty bad," [...] growled the conductor. [...] "Tom, here, {{thought his}} arm was broken, at first; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> only sprained." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Our benefactor’s. Mrs. Westgate. What’s his name? J. L. It ‘kind of’ {{sounds like}} a number. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it’s</b> a high number,” he {{continued}} with freshened gaiety.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the final}} of the 2011 U.S. Open against Samantha Stosur, Williams shouted [...] "Come on!" [...] as the Australian {{attempted}} to return a forehand Williams believed to be a winner. The chair umpire Eva Asderaki awarded the point to Stosur based on the USTA's deliberate hindrance rule, which states, [...] "If a player commits any act which hinders his opponent in making a stroke, then, if this is deliberate, he shall lose the point or if involuntary, the point shall be replayed." [...] As the point was 30–40 on Williams's serve, the penalty gave the break of serve to Stosur. Williams became angry with the chair umpire and made several gestures and unflattering comments toward her during the next changeover, including telling Asderaki that if she ever saw the umpire coming toward her, she should [...] "look the other way". Williams initially gained momentum in the set following the penalty, breaking back in the next game, but eventually flagged and lost the match, 2–6, 3–6. At the end of the match, she declined to offer the customary handshake to Asderaki. Williams mentioned the incident in her post-match speech as the tournament runner-up, claiming, [...] "I hit a winner, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> didn't count," [...] but added, [...] "It wouldn't have mattered in the end. Sam played really well." [...] A writer for ESPN suggested that Williams could avoid being found to have violated the terms of the [...] "probation" [...] on which she was placed following her 2009 outburst, as she did not appear to have used profanity in addressing Asderaki during the match. In the end, Williams was fined $2,000 and was not barred from competing in the 2012 US Open because [...] "...Williams's conduct, while verbally abusive, [...] not {{rise to the level of}} a major offence under the Grand Slam code of conduct." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that's all, mother. I {{should say}} I had dreamt, it, if I had slept any last night; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> really happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha-ha!" [...] he laughed; [...] "the {{years are}} coming over us a little, aren't they? <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> isn't quite {{time for the}} youngsters to step in yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Wah!' {{answered}} Joseph, 'yon dainty chap says he cannut ate 'em. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> raight! His mother wer just soa--we wer a'most too mucky to sow t' corn for makking her breead.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I will, Danny, {{just this}} once," [...] said Peter. [...] "It's a long way, and I've {{never been there}} before; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> just as safe as the Meadows or the Green Forest.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Harding, [...] "Clarke has {{certainly}} got a tight hold on you, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> possible to shake him off. As things stand, however, {{it seems to}} me he has most to gain from your death." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir Raffle Buffle {{has got a}} {{new pair}} of shoes. I don't know that for certain, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> from the time it took him to put them on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought it}} was the devil; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> must have been one of them gorilephants. Oh, my poor baby, my poor little honey," [...] and again Esmeralda broke into {{uncontrollable}} sobbing.|$|E
6000|$|... "We wouldn't do for grand opera soloists, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> will be {{good enough}} to attract crowds in small country towns," [...] laughed Andy, as he ground out a lively German waltz.|$|E
6000|$|... "Some of {{the stuff}} might be used for low-grade varnish, but that's not what I'm out for. I've been trying {{to believe that a}} few of the {{specimens}} might prove better on analysis, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> a delusion." ...|$|R
6000|$|Langbourne had {{not said}} it, but he acquiesced {{with a faint}} sigh, and absently took the hand of {{farewell}} which Juliet Bingham gave him. [...] "I know Barbara will be very sorry not to see you; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's gone," [...] {{said the}} grizzled prospector. [...] "Many another has gone the same way. Find them! Of course, we'll search, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> hopeless. Don't think your partner was great on swimming, {{and he was}} loaded heavy. Come on, daylight's going." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] Devine agreed. [...] "The sand hasn't got far in, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> {{will work}} right through {{unless we have}} a change. If not, there'll be trouble {{for both of us}} this fall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some of {{them are}} in the workings, some of them on the range, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> was for Vancouver the Fraser crowd started out. Seemed to me they meant to get there before they stopped." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I ain't; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> {{is going}} to rain, so I shall have to go any way," [...] {{answered}} Bab, {{taking advantage of the}} black clouds rolling up the sky, for she scorned to own that she was afraid of any thing.|$|E
6000|$|He {{perceived}} the anxiety that the girl's pride {{could not keep}} out of her tone, but he answered indifferently, [...] "I'm a little too near that color myself. I hear that red hair's coming into fashion, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> natural <b>I</b> should prefer black." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Martin, [...] "if {{you have}} to choose between quitting and selling your copper claim, you had better let the {{telegraph}} contract go." [...] He paused and gave Jim a level glance. [...] "Looks like interested advice, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> sound." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{only put}} it there to scare him," [...] {{explained}} Randy. [...] "It's one of his old suits stuffed out. We thought it might fall out on him {{when he opened the}} door. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> better the way it is," [...] he chuckled.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hark!" [...] said Kinney, craning {{his neck}} forward to listen. [...] "I thought I heard sleigh-bells. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> wa'n't. Well, sir, as I was sayin', they fetched that fellow into camp {{with both feet}} frozen to the knees--Dumn 'f it wa'n't bells!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't exactly justify this trade, Jim, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> {{all depends}} on the mother. She ought to be happy anyway, whether you are or not; so if she thinks she'd better go with you, why, I ain't got a word to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One of them's gone," [...] {{said the}} teamster. [...] "There'll be trouble {{when we go}} back, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> can't be helped. Anyway, there's 'most a fathom in the deep below the ford, and no mule would do much {{swimming}} with that load." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it's {{pretty easy}} to cry over a book," [...] said Penelope, laughing; [...] "and that one is very natural till {{you come to the}} main point. Then the naturalness of all the rest makes that seem natural too; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> rather forced." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would have}} burnt lively, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> all right now. Keep {{an eye on}} the roof, Ben, and I'll step up garret and see if all's safe there. Didn't you know that chimney was foul, ma'am?" [...] asked the man, as he wiped the {{perspiration}} off his grimy face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Seems so," [...] the old sailor replied. [...] "The blue {{is around}} all {{one side of}} it an' a pink {{sunshine}} around the other side.

6000|$|... "I'll remember, mother. I hate {{not to be}} obliging, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> {{would have}} saved us lots of trouble if I'd said No in the beginning. I tried to, but she would go. Poor Jill! I'll {{take better care of}} her next time. Is she very ill, Mamma?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] said Fulkerson. [...] "They'll {{get along}} now. We've done all we could, and there's nothing left but {{for them to}} bear it.

6000|$|I was dumbfounded--this was {{my thanks}} for saving her from Jubal! I {{turned and looked}} at the corpse. [...] "May be that I saved you from a worse fate, old man," [...] I said, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> was lost on Dian, for she never seemed to notice it at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] he said firmly, [...] "I do {{not part}} with." [...] Mr. Skinner {{scratched}} his ear with his penholder. [...] "It's the only scrap of identifying matter we've got," [...] he remarked. [...] "Of course it's a dead simple case, {{and we can}} probably manage without <b>it.</b> <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> as well to fix the thing right down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish {{we could}} start. If I could have had you with me these last few months I'd never have quit. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> out of the question. You've no idea what sort of an inferno it is, and I won't let you come into it with your eyes shut. But if ever {{you are in a}} real tight corner let me know. It might be worth your while then to take a few risks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The captain muttered some {{order to}} his men, which <b>I</b> didn't hear; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>it</b> {{was to leave}} us alone, for the present. I had no doubt what they {{intended}} {{to do was to}} catch us off our guard, and wrench the pistols from us; and I was glad I had the knife hidden away, for if they did carry us off, I was sure {{to be able to find}} some opportunity for using that.|$|R
