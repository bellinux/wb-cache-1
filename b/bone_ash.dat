40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the phosphorous requirements (Pd) when monoammonium phosphate (MAP) {{is used as a}} phosphorous (P) source for broilers in the starter phase (1 to 21 days). We used 800 male chicks at one day old, in a 5 x 2 factorial arrangement, with five Pd levels (0. 28, 0. 34, 0. 40, 0. 46 and 0. 52 %) and two Ca levels (1. 00 and 0. 60), totaling ten treatments and eight replicates. Significant interaction was observed between the phosphorus and calcium levels from the diet, in the performances traits, <b>bone</b> <b>ashes</b> and P retention and excretion. Utilizing the level of 1. 0 % Ca in the diet, the best results of performance and <b>bone</b> <b>ashes</b> were founded when the levels of 0. 42 % and 0. 439 % Pd were used, respectively. Better contents of <b>bone</b> <b>ashes</b> were observed with the use of 0. 60 % Ca in the diet only when the lowest level of P was used. When the MAP was utilized as a source of P in the diet for broilers in the starter phase, the use of the 0. 43 % of Pd and 1. 00 % of Ca is enough to promote better performance and bone mineralization...|$|R

25|$|Phosphorus is {{essential}} for life. Phosphates (compounds containing the phosphate ion, PO43−) are a component of DNA, RNA, ATP, and the phospholipids, which form all cell membranes. Demonstrating the link between phosphorus and life, elemental phosphorus was first isolated from human urine, and <b>bone</b> <b>ash</b> was an important early phosphate source. Phosphate mines contain fossils, especially marine fossils, because phosphate {{is present in the}} fossilized deposits of animal remains and excreta. Low phosphate levels are an important limit to growth in some aquatic systems. The vast majority of phosphorus compounds produced are consumed as fertilisers. Phosphate is needed to replace the phosphorus that plants remove from the soil, and its annual demand is rising nearly twice as fast as the growth of the human population. Other applications include the role of organophosphorus compounds in detergents, pesticides, and nerve agents.|$|E
25|$|White {{phosphorus}} {{was first}} made commercially in the 19th century for the match industry. This used <b>bone</b> <b>ash</b> for a phosphate source, as described above. The bone-ash process became obsolete when the submerged-arc furnace for phosphorus production {{was introduced to}} reduce phosphate rock. The electric furnace method allowed production to increase {{to the point where}} phosphorus could be used in weapons of war. In World War I it was used in incendiaries, smoke screens and tracer bullets. A special incendiary bullet was developed to shoot at hydrogen-filled Zeppelins over Britain (hydrogen being highly flammable). During World War II, Molotov cocktails made of phosphorus dissolved in petrol were distributed in Britain to specially selected civilians within the British resistance operation, for defence; and phosphorus incendiary bombs were used in war on a large scale. Burning phosphorus is difficult to extinguish and if it splashes onto human skin it has horrific effects.|$|E

500|$|Although {{women and}} girls {{probably}} worked in mining since antiquity, the earliest known written references to female manual labourers in mining are in the 13th and 14thcentury records of the royal lead and silver mines at Bere Alston, {{on the border between}} Devon and Cornwall. (The mines were bordered on three sides by a loop of the River Tamar, since 936 the traditional boundary between Devon and Cornwall. The mines themselves were on the Devon side of the border at Bere Alston itself, but the surface-level smelters were on the Cornish side at Calstock as there was a readier supply of timber for use in the furnaces.) Although the mining itself was carried out by men, female workers were employed to sort ore for crushing, to prepare the <b>bone</b> <b>ash</b> used as a flux during the smelting process, and for general manual labour. An adult woman was paid up to one penny per day, and young girls between [...] and [...] of a penny. Miners and other skilled labourers at Bere Alston were recruited from throughout England and Wales, and from the evidence of surnames in the records it appears that many of the female labourers were the wives and daughters of these incomers rather than locally recruited women.|$|E

2500|$|In 1769 Johan Gottlieb Gahn and Carl Wilhelm Scheele {{showed that}} calcium {{phosphate}} (...) {{is found in}} bones, and they obtained elemental phosphorus from <b>bone</b> <b>ash.</b> Antoine Lavoisier recognised phosphorus as an element in 1777. <b>Bone</b> <b>ash</b> was {{the major source of}} phosphorus until the 1840s. The method started by roasting bones, then employed the use of clay retorts encased in a very hot brick furnace to distill out the highly toxic elemental phosphorus product. Alternately, precipitated phosphates could be made from ground-up bones that had been de-greased and treated with strong acids. White phosphorus could then be made by heating the precipitated phosphates, mixed with ground coal or charcoal in an iron pot, and distilling off phosphorus vapour in a retort. Carbon monoxide and other flammable gases produced during the reduction process were burnt off in a flare stack.|$|E
2500|$|Some spodomantic rituals {{require the}} use of a certain writing surface. Most of the rituals {{outlined}} above indicate the use of the hearth, floor, or exterior ground as the place to spread ashes. But some examples of spodomancy call for the use of other types of surfaces. Consider the use of bone: Divination techniques closely related to spodomancy include osteomancy (divination using bones, particularly that practice which heats them to produce cracks which are portentious), plastromancy (divination using turtle plastrons), scapulimancy (divination using the shoulder blade; the Scottish term is slinneanachd), and sternomancy (divination using the sternum). However, in these practices, fire is used to cause cracks to appear in the <b>bone.</b> <b>Ash</b> {{may or may not be}} used to fill in these cracks, making them more visible. [...] This is not spodomancy, however, as the cracks (not the ash itself) are being read. [...] In Mongolia, however, a divinatory ritual exists in which scapulimancy and spodomancy are combined: A smooth layer of ashes is spread on the shoulder blade of a cow, sheep, or ox, and a lama is divinely inspired to make calculations in the ash which indicate answers to questions or the future. Bone is not the only alternative surface used. Some ancient Greek rituals of spodomancy required that the ashes be spread on a plank of wood rather than the floor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bone</b> <b>ash</b> {{is a white}} {{material}} produced by the calcination of bones. Typical <b>bone</b> <b>ash</b> consists of about 55.82% calcium oxide, 42.39% phosphorus pentoxide, and 1.79% water. The exact composition of these compounds varies depending upon the type of bones being used, but generally the formula for <b>bone</b> <b>ash</b> is: Ca5(OH)(PO4)3. <b>Bone</b> <b>ash</b> usually has a density around 3.10 g/mL and a melting point of 1670 °C (3038 °F).

50|$|The raw {{material}} for bone china is about 50% <b>bone</b> <b>ash</b> derived from animal bones.

Lastly, the newly sterilized bone is ground with water into fine particles which {{can be used as a}} {{raw material}} for bone china. <b>Bone</b> <b>ash</b> plays an important role in the creation of bone china, as the phosphate of the bone generates beta tricalcium phosphate, and other compounds from the bone create a calcium crystal called anorthite.
