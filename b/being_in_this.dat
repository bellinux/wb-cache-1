25|$|In 1840, at age 12, {{her family}} became {{involved}} with the Millerite movement. As she attended William Miller's lectures, she felt guilty for her sins, and was filled with terror about being eternally lost. She describes herself as spending nights in tears and prayer, and <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> condition for several months. On June 26, 1842, she was baptized by John Hobart in Casco Bay in Portland, Maine, and eagerly awaited Jesus to come again. In her later years, she referred to this as the happiest time of her life. Her family's involvement with Millerism caused them to be disfellowshipped by the local Methodist church.|$|E
25|$|The {{starting}} point of the scholarly controversy is the disputed meaning of the Greek concept of ousia. This is an ordinary Greek word and literally means 'being.' In philosophical contexts, it is usually translated by 'Being' or 'Essence.' Plato's Republic says that the Good is 'not ousia' but is rather 'beyond ousia' and surpasses it as an origin and in power. If this passage implies only that the essence or nature of the Good is beyond Being (but not the Good itself), or if the passage is just interpreted loosely, then the Form of the Good can retain its place inside {{the realm of the}} Forms, i.e., the realm of things with real <b>Being.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> case the Good is not absolutely transcendent: it does not transcend Being and somehow exist above it. The Good would therefore have a place in the hierarchy of real Beings. According to this interpretation, the Good is not an issue for the two principles of the unwritten doctrines but only for the Theory of Forms. On the other hand, if the passage in the Republic is read literally and 'ousia' means 'Being,' then the phrase 'beyond Being' implies the Good actually transcends Being. According to this interpretation, Plato considered the Good to be absolutely transcendent and it must be integrated into the realm of the two principles.|$|E

500|$|The {{director}} {{of the film is}} not known for certain, but two Thanhouser directors are possible. Barry O'Neil was the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy, who would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two-reeler, Romeo and Juliet. Lloyd B. Carleton was the stage name of Carleton B. Little, a director who would stay with the Thanhouser Company for a short time, moving to Biograph Company by the summer of 1910. The American Film Institute credits Barry O'Neil as the director. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute either as the director for this particular production, but he does credit Blair Smith as the cameraman. The film was the debut of Marie Eline, soon to be known and famous as the [...] "Thanhouser Kid".

[...] As the title suggests, the book [...] examines [...] "The Joy of Sect" [...] from a psychological point of view. It discusses the psychology of decision-making in the episode, noting, [...] "Homer is becoming a full-blown member of the Movementarians not by a rational choice,... but {{through the process of}} escalating behavioral commitments." [...] The Psychology of the Simpsons explains the key recruitment techniques used by the Movementarians, including the charismatic leader, established authority based on a religious entity or alien <b>being</b> (<b>in</b> <b>this</b> case [...] "Blisstonia"), and the method of taking away free choice through acceptance of the Leader's greatness. The book also analyzes the techniques used during the six-hour Movementarian recruitment film. In that scene, those who rise to leave are reminded that they are allowed to leave whenever they wish. They are, however, questioned in front of the group as to specifically why they wish to leave, and these individuals end up staying to finish watching the film. The book describes this technique as [...] "subtle pressure", in contrast to the [...] "razor wire, landmines, angry dogs, crocodiles and evil mystery bubble Marge confronts to escape, while being reminded again that she is certainly free to leave". The Psychology of the Simpsons writes that [...] "the Leader" [...] is seen as an authority figure, because [...] "he has knowledge or abilities that others do not, but want". Instead of traditional mathematics textbooks, the children on the compound learn from Arithmetic the Leader's Way and Science for Leader Lovers.|$|E

2500|$|In 1689, Maryland Puritans, by now a {{substantial}} {{majority in the}} colony, revolted against the proprietary government, {{in part because of}} the apparent preferment of Catholics like Colonel Henry Darnall to official positions of power.

Darnall later wrote: [...] "Wee <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> condition and no hope left of quieting the people thus enraged, to prevent effusion of blood, capitulated and surrendered." [...] The victorious Coode and his Puritans set up a new government that outlawed Catholicism, and Darnall was deprived of all his official roles.
