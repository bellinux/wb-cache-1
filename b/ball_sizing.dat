40|$|The fine {{grinding}} of ores is increasing {{due to the}} depletion of coarse grained, easily processed ore bodies and the increased need to process disseminated, fine grained deposits. The main reason ball mills are not utilised for {{fine grinding}} is the perceived poor energy efficiency generally experienced when grinding to fine sizes. However there is a trend towards ball mill grinding for product sizes below the traditional ball mill cut-off of 45 μm. The effect of ball size on the feed and product size distributions in a fine grinding situation was studied. The grinding tests {{identified a number of}} trends for fine grinding, including: •Efficient grind curves forming the same shape as for traditional grinding (exponential decay). •The results supporting the claim that fine material is best ground with small media and coarse material with larger media. •The smallest charge was most efficient at treating the finer feeds. •The smaller charges were very ineffective and inefficient for grinding of the coarser feeds. • Efficient grind was undertaken by smaller charges than that recommended by Bond’s <b>ball</b> <b>sizing</b> formula, and • Operating work index analysis confirming the results of the P 80 -energy analysis...|$|E

In all cases, binary mixtures of two <b>ball</b> <b>sizes</b> (50. 8 mm and 25. 4 mm) performed better than a mixture of the three <b>ball</b> <b>sizes.</b> An equation therefore could be developed for calculating the optimum composition of the make-up balls as a function of various parameters...|$|R

The influence of the <b>ball</b> <b>size</b> distribution on the specific selection function can be approached by laboratory runs using mono-size balls. The breakage is more efficient with maximal specific selection functions at the initial size reduction stage.

So, the choice of <b>ball</b> <b>size</b> according to a maximal specific selection function leads to an increase of the energy consumption.

The magnetic properties of SmCo 5 particles prepared by SABM with different milling <b>ball</b> <b>sizes</b> in diameters were investigated systematically. It was showed that the nanoflakes milled by amount of small <b>size</b> <b>balls</b> had a higher coercivity and lower anisotropy, i. e., worse grain orientation although in a short milling time while the nanoflakes prepared with same weight of big balls tend to have a lower coercivity, better grain orientation. The coercivity mechanism of the nanoflake was studied and it was mainly dominated with the domain-wall pinning. The SEM analysis shows that the morphology of nanoflakes prepared with different <b>ball</b> <b>sizes</b> are almost the same when the balls to powder weight ratio isfixed. The different magnetic properties caused by different <b>ball</b> <b>sizes</b> are mainly due to the different microstructure changes, i. e, grain refinement andc-axis orientation, which are demonstrated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and transmission electron microscope (TEM).

Results indicate participants sustained their level of kick performance (accuracy and quality of ball spin) in both tests when using a Size 5 football.

40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to apply Box–Behnken experimental design and response surface methodology (RSM) for grinding modeling of some copper sulphide ores. In the present work, the effects of some key grinding parameters such as <b>ball</b> <b>size</b> (20 – 40 mm), grinding time (10 – 30 min), solids content (65 – 80 %), and also ore work index (12 – 15. 4 kWh/t) on the grinding of some copper sulphide ore were investigated. Product 80 % passing size (d 80) was defined as process response. Grinding experiments were designed and executed by a laboratory ball mill. These experiments were conducted on two feed sizes (480 and 1000 μm). Predicted values of response obtained using model equation were in good agreement with the experimental values (R 2 values were 0. 997 and 0. 996 for d 80 of 480 and 1000 μm feed sizes respectively). The effect of parameters was explained as bellow:-The d 80 of product was decreased with increasing solids content from 65 to 71 %. -The relation between work index and also <b>ball</b> <b>size</b> with d 80 were linear over the studied range. -The effect of <b>ball</b> <b>size</b> and also grinding time on d 80 was more at lower values of solids content compared to higher values of solids content at studied levels. -The effect of grinding time on d 80 was more at lower values of work index rather than higher values. -There was no effect of feed size on the order of effective parameters but increasing feed size had effect on the interaction of variables...|$|R
40|$|Grinding {{media in}} coarse {{grinding}} tumbling mills constitute the biggest consumable cost to a comminution processing plant, {{therefore it is}} critically important to minimize associated wear. Secondly, efficient grinding is dependent on tight control of the desired <b>ball</b> <b>size</b> distribution, or else optimum impact breakage cannot be assured. Despite the significance of minitoring <b>ball</b> <b>size</b> distribution for mill operation, no practically deployable systems are currently in industry use to measure it. This paper describes a new method for highly accurate, comprehensive, and rapid determination of <b>ball</b> <b>size</b> distribution. Accurate SAG and AG mill product size control is dependent on appropriate Grate Open Area dimensions. Wear of the grate hole edges or in the plate thickness results in an increase of the open area due to the tapered hole cross section, which can result in oversize product exiting the mill. Conversely, some grate castings feature peening of the edges during mill operation, thereby decreasing open area, and therefore preventing the desireed top size product from exiting the mill. SAG mill throughput requires grate holes to remain open or else throughput is restricted. Many grates in operation are pegged by grinding media to varying degrees of severity. This paper introduces a comprehensive, accurate and rapid method to measure and track the size and pegging status of each and all grate holes in situ, and therefore provides tracking information on the Open Area of a SAG mill. This enables operators to control the primary mill product size and therefore the opportunity to stabilize downstream processes...|$|R
