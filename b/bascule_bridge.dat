5|$|The Chicago and North Western Railway's Kinzie Street {{railroad}} bridge (also {{known as}} the Carroll Avenue bridge) is a single leaf <b>bascule</b> <b>bridge</b> across the north branch of the Chicago River in downtown Chicago, Illinois. At {{the time of its}} opening in 1908 it was the world's longest and heaviest <b>bascule</b> <b>bridge.</b> Previous bridges on the same site included the first bridge to cross the Chicago River, Chicago's first railroad bridge, {{and one of the first}} all-steel bridges in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Michigan Avenue Bridge is a double-leaf, double-deck, fixed counterweight, {{trunnion}} <b>bascule</b> <b>bridge.</b> It was {{engineered by}} the Chicago Department of Public Works, Bureau of Engineering; Edward H. Bennett was the consulting architect and William A. Mulcahy {{the chief engineer}} of construction. At the time of construction it {{was believed to be}} the first double-deck bridge ever built to have roadway on both levels; faster non-commercial traffic using the upper deck and slower commercial traffic that served the various industries and docks in the vicinity of the river using the lower deck.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the bridges}} which cross the river are movable, to allow {{shipping}} to pass. There are six swing bridges; four bascule bridges, {{two of which}} have twin leaves, one for each carriageway of the roads which they carry; and three Scherzer lift bridges, which are a type of rolling <b>bascule</b> <b>bridge.</b> Scott Street Bridge, which is now permanently raised, was originally powered from a high pressure water main maintained by the first public power distribution company in the world.|$|E

5|$|Route 3 {{crosses the}} Passaic River {{on a fixed}} bridge, which {{replaced}} a double-leaf trunnion <b>bascule</b> <b>bridge</b> in 2013, into Rutherford, Bergen County. Just after crossing the river, the route interchanges with County Route 507 (Riverside Avenue). The freeway continues through a residential area and comes to an exit that provides access to southbound Route 17. Past this interchange, Route 3 is closely paralleled by Route 17 to the south until Route 3 interchanges again with Route 17, which continues {{to the north of}} Route 3.|$|E
5|$|A {{boulevard}} to {{link the}} parks on Chicago's north and south sides was proposed as early as 1891. An early plan called for a tunnel to link Michigan Avenue south of the river with Pine Street (now Michigan Avenue) north of the river. In 1903 {{an editorial in the}} Chicago Tribune proposed a new <b>bascule</b> <b>bridge</b> across the river at Michigan Avenue. Other plans suggested that the bridge should be a replica of the Pont Alexandre III that spans the Seine in Paris, or that, rather than constructing an entirely new bridge, the existing Rush Street bridge should be double-decked.|$|E
5|$|In {{the centre}} of the town lies Weymouth Harbour; {{although}} it was the reason for the town's foundation, the harbour separates the two areas of Melcombe Regis (the main town centre) and Weymouth (the southern harbourside) from each other. Since the 18th century they have been linked by successive bridges over the narrowest part of the harbour. The present Town Bridge, built in 1930, is a lifting <b>bascule</b> <b>bridge</b> allowing boats to access the inner harbour. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution stationed a lifeboat at Weymouth {{for the first time on}} 26 January 1869. A boathouse was built with a slipway by the harbour and is still in use, although the lifeboat is now moored at a pontoon.|$|E

5|$|Edward DeVoe Tompkins, Inc. {{suffered}} numerous {{delays in}} the construction of the bridge and sued the City of Bridgeport. The case went to the Connecticut Supreme Court in Edward DeV. Tompkins v. City of Bridgeport, Connecticut. Tompkins sued the City of Bridgeport for breach of contract on the grounds that City of Bridgeport was unresponsive, and did not clear the site as scheduled. Tompkins also cited other concerns relating to the design and construction of the bridge including the design engineers from the Strauss <b>Bascule</b> <b>Bridge</b> Company being located in Chicago. The City of Bridgeport alleged that Tompkins was incompetent and uncooperative, but the Connecticut Supreme Court disagreed and ruled in favor of Tompkins. The Court awarded Tompkins the full contract as damages.|$|E
5|$|Northwest of Holland, {{the highway}} runs as a four-lane {{expressway}} and divided highway parallel, but inland from, the Lake Michigan shoreline. This section of US31 runs through {{a mix of}} farm fields and forests as it runs to the community of Agnew. There, US31 intersects {{the western end of}} M-45 (Lake Michigan Drive) before continuing into the southern end of Grand Haven. In that city, the highway follows a four-lane boulevard with a grass median. On the northern edge of the city of Grand Haven, US31 crosses the Grand River on a <b>bascule</b> <b>bridge</b> that opens about 450–500times per year. North of the structure, US31 transitions into a freeway at the interchange with the western end of M-104 in Ferrysburg. This freeway continues northward through the suburban edges of the Muskegon area and meets the western end of I-96 near the Muskegon County Airport in Norton Shores.|$|E
5|$|River {{traffic and}} {{railroad}} traffic were increasingly {{in competition with}} each other. In October 1879 a disaster was narrowly avoided when a seven-coach passenger train with 800 people on board approached the open swing bridge too fast and was barely able to stop in time, ending up with its front wheels hanging off the approach road over the river. Meanwhile, boats on the river were getting larger and finding {{it increasingly difficult to}} navigate the bridges {{at the mouth of the}} north branch, so the Army Corps of Engineers ordered the clearing of three swing bridges near Kinzie Street that were obstructing river traffic. Therefore, in 1907 construction started on a new <b>bascule</b> <b>bridge</b> that would allow more space for boats to pass by on the river.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} Bristol Harbour Railway was a {{joint venture}} by the GWR and the Bristol and Exeter Railway, opened in 1872 between Temple Meads and the Floating Harbour. Its route included a tunnel under St Mary Redcliffe church and a steam-powered <b>bascule</b> <b>bridge</b> over the entrance locks at Bathurst Basin. In 1876 the railway was extended by half a mile to Wapping Wharf. In 1906, new branches from the south via the Ashton Avenue swing bridge were built to Canons Marsh {{on the north side}} of the Floating Harbour and to Wapping via a line alongside the New Cut. A Coal Concentration Depot owned by Western Fuels was established at Wapping Wharf just behind the Industrial Museum but this closed in 1987.|$|E
5|$|US23 {{follows the}} Lake Huron {{shoreline}} through Cheboygan County through woodlands past Cheboygan State Park and Duncan Bay. On {{the eastern edge}} of Cheboygan the highway intersects F-05 before following State Street through a commercial district. State Street crosses the Cheboygan River on the Cheboygan <b>Bascule</b> <b>Bridge</b> near the mouth of the river and the dock for the USCGC Mackinaw. On {{the west side of the}} river, US23 meets the northern terminus of M-27 at the intersection with Main Street. State Street continues westerly as C-66 as US23 turns north on Main Street for a block before resuming west on Mackinaw Avenue. The highway continues along the lake toward Mackinaw City. As it approaches the village, it passes Historic Mill Creek State Park and several motels. At Nicolet Street in town, the highway crosses into Emmet County for the short distance to the highway's national northern terminus at I-75's exit338.|$|E
5|$|State Route 160 {{begins in}} eastern Antioch at SR 4. After two interchanges, the highway rises onto the two lane Antioch Bridge over the San Joaquin River. It cuts north across {{the center of}} Sherman Island, {{reaching}} the Sacramento River on the opposite shore. From here to Sacramento, SR 160 never strays far from the river, first following the east levee over the 1949 Three Mile Slough Bridge (a lift bridge), past Brannan Island State Recreation Area, and across SR 12 opposite the river from Rio Vista. After passing Isleton, the highway crosses the river on the Isleton Bridge, a <b>bascule</b> <b>bridge</b> built in 1923, and runs along the west shore on Grand Island, where it meets {{the east end of}} SR 220. The Walnut Grove Bridge carries County Route J11 east across the river to Walnut Grove, and, {{at the north end of}} the island, SR 160 crosses the 1924 Steamboat Slough Bridge onto Sutter Island and then the 1923 Paintersville Bridge across the Sacramento River to the mainland, both bascule bridges.|$|E

5|$|The A350 road is Poole town centre's main artery, running north along Holes Bay {{and on to}} the A35, and as {{a single}} {{carriageway}} to Bath and Bristol. To the east, the A337 road leads to Lymington and the New Forest. The A35 trunk road runs from Devon to Southampton and connects to the A31 {{on the outskirts of the}} town. The A31, the major trunk road in central southern England, connects to the M27 motorway at Southampton. From here the M3 motorway leads to London, and fast access may also be gained via the A34 to the M4 north of Newbury. Poole Bridge, a narrow <b>bascule</b> <b>bridge</b> constructed in 1927, connects the town centre and Hamworthy. Approval for a second bridge was given by the Department for Transport in 2006 and the £37million Twin Sails bridge was completed in 2012. A road link to Studland and the Isle of Purbeck across the narrow entrance of Poole Harbour is provided by the Sandbanks Ferry.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Street Bridge was a {{double-leaf}} deck-girder <b>bascule</b> <b>bridge</b> in Bridgeport, Connecticut, United States, {{that spanned}} the Pequonnock River and connected Grand Street and Artic Street. It {{was one of}} three movable bridges planned by the City of Bridgeport in 1916 {{at the request of the}} War Department during World War I. Construction was completed in 1919, but the delays surrounding the construction went to the Connecticut Supreme Court in case of Edward DeV. Tompkins, Inc. vs. City of Bridgeport, Connecticut. The court ruled in favor of Tompkins and awarded damages equal to the contract. In 1936, the bridge had excessive settling and required the replacement of its southeast pier. As part of the repairs, a new floor and electrical system were installed. In 1965, the floor was replaced with a steel grate on I-beam floor. In 1984, the eastern approach span was replaced and the northwest trunnion post was reconstructed. The bridge was closed in the 1990s and dismantled in 1999.|$|E
5|$|The City of Bridgeport {{appointed}} a bridge commission {{to replace the}} aging East Washington Avenue Bridge on December 7, 1915. The commission chose a Joseph B. Strausss patented design from the Strauss <b>Bascule</b> <b>Bridge</b> Company of Chicago, Illinois. The city engineer James A. McElroy drew up {{the plans for the}} bridge's specifications and the plans were completed on February 17, 1916. The steel for the construction was ordered from the Penn Bridge Company. The project was suspended because of a dispute with the contractor and a lack of funds to erect the bridge, but in 1923 the State of Connecticut appropriated $350,000 to complete the project. Only two bids for the bridge's erection were placed, the first by Bridgeport Dry Dock and Dredging for $326,575 and the second by C. W. Blakeslee and Sons for $389,492 with estimations varying based on extra work needed. Bridgeport Dry Dock and Dredging won the contract and the materials were shipped to Bridgeport, with work beginning mid-1924. The completed bridge included an operator's house and a public toilet building. The bridge, costing over $550,000 in total, was turned over to the city on October 14, 1925.|$|E

50|$|A {{drawbridge}} or draw-bridge {{is a type}} of {{movable bridge}} typically associated with the entrance of a castle and a number of towers, surrounded by a moat. In some forms of English, including American English, the word drawbridge commonly refers to all types of movable <b>bridges,</b> such as <b>bascule</b> <b>bridges,</b> vertical-lift bridges and swing bridges, but this article concerns the narrower, more historical definition of the term.|$|R
50|$|The {{previous}} {{bridge was}} constructed between 1898 and 1902 by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (replacing an earlier bridge) {{as one of}} two through girder Scherzer rolling <b>bascule</b> <b>bridges</b> on the New Haven Line. The bridge consisted of twin parallel rolling lift spans.|$|R
50|$|The {{name comes}} from the French term for balance scale, which employs the same principle. <b>Bascule</b> <b>bridges</b> {{are the most common}} type of movable span because they open quickly and require {{relatively}} little energy to operate, while providing the possibility for unlimited vertical clearance for marine traffic.|$|R
