5|$|The {{announcement}} that Portal 2 would <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>on</b> PlayStation 3 {{came as a}} surprise to the industry because Gabe Newell had criticized that console in the past, citing difficulties in the port of The Orange Box.

Portal 2 was the first PlayStation 3 game to support a subset of features from Steamworks, including automatic updates, downloadable content, and community support. The game supports cross-platform play between the PlayStation 3, Windows, and OS X versions.|$|E
5|$|The chapter also {{examines}} celebrity {{endorsement of}} certain drugs, {{the extent to}} which claims in advertisements aimed at doctors are appropriately sourced, and whether direct-to-consumer advertising (currently permitted in the US and New Zealand) ought to be allowed.

Two breast-cancer patients who campaigned in the UK in 2006 for trastuzumab (Herceptin) to <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>on</b> the NHS were being handled by a law firm working for Roche, the drug's manufacturer. The historian Lisa Jardine, who was suffering from breast cancer, told the Guardian that she had been approached by a PR firm working for the company.|$|E
