In {{a variety of}} experimental systems, representing the sequential events of the angiogenic process, aeroplysinin- 1 treatment of endothelial cells resulted in strong inhibitory effects. Aeroplysinin- 1 inhibited the growth of endothelial cells in culture and induced endothelial cell apoptosis. Capillary tube formation on Matrigel was completely abrogated by addition of aeroplysinin- 1 at the low micromolar range. Aeroplysinin- 1 also exhibited a clear inhibitory effect on the migration capabilities of endothelial cells. Zymographic assays showed that aeroplysinin- 1 treatment produced {{a decrease in the}} concentration of matrix metalloproteinase- 2 and urokinase in conditioned medium from endothelial cells. Finally, aeroplysinin- 1 exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the in vivo chorioallantoic membrane assay, showing potent apoptosis-inducing activity in the developing endothelium. The in vivo inhibition of angiogenesis by aeroplysinin- 1 was confirmed by the Matrigel plug assay.

40|$|TNF-related {{apoptosis}}-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a tumor-selective apoptosis inducer and {{has been}} shown to be promising for treating various types of cancers. However, the application of TRAIL is greatly impeded by the resistance of cancer cells to its action. Studies show that overexpression of some critical pro-survival proteins, such as survivin, is responsible for TRAIL resistance. In this study, we found that Aplysin, a <b>brominated</b> <b>compound</b> from marine organisms, was able to restore the sensitivity of cancer cells to TRAIL both in vitro and in vivo. Aplysin was found to enhance the tumor-suppressing capacity of TRAIL on several TRAIL-resistant cancer cell lines. TRAIL-induced apoptosis was also potentiated in A 549 and MCF 7 cells treated with Aplysin. Survivin downregulation was identified as a mechanism by which Aplysin-mediated TRAIL sensitization of cancer cells. Furthermore, the activation of p 38 MAPK was revealed in Aplysin-treated cancer cells, and its inhibitor SB 203580 was able to abrogate the promoting effect of Aplysin on the response of cancer cells to TRAIL action, as evidenced by restored survivin expression, elevated cell survival and reduced apoptotic rates. In conclusion, we provided evidence that Aplysin acts as a sensitizer for TRAIL and its effect on p 38 MAPK/survivin pathway may partially account for this activity. Considering its low cytotoxicity to normal cells, Aplysin may be a promising agent for cancer treatment in combination with TRAIL...|$|E
40|$|The {{scarcity}} of land based oil reserves has necessitated {{the exploration of}} off shore oil. This exploration is often carried out in pristine waters {{and the use of}} green chemicals is essential to reduce environmental degradation. In the recovery of oil and gas from rocky formations, well bore fluids such as packer fluids, fracturing fluids, conformance and permeability control fluids are extensively employed. Potassium oleate as viscoelastic surfactants gives a low partition coefficient when in contact with hydrocarbon. Bromination of the oleate chain has been shown in this work to increase the partition coefficient and still maintaining its viscoelasticity. The partition coefficient increased to ca 8 % compared to negligible for potassium oleate. A gel was formed when a 20 % solution of potasssium 9 -bromo stearate was mixed with 8 % KCl. Contacting this gel with hydrocarbon resulted in a loss of viscosity due to the improved solubility of the <b>brominated</b> <b>compound</b> in hydrocarbon. This facilitates the removal of the surfactants after its use as a fracturing fluid. The viscoelastic properties were demonstrated using a Bohlin rheometer.

40|$|Noscapine, an opium-derived 'kinder-gentler' microtubule-modulating drug is in Phase I/II {{clinical}} trials for cancer chemotherapy. However, its limited water solubility encumbers its development into an oral anticancer drug with clinical promise. Here we report {{the synthesis of}} 9 third-generation, water-soluble noscapine analogs with negatively charged sulfonato and positively charged quaternary ammonium groups using noscapine, 9 -bromonoscapine and 9 -aminonoscapine as scaffolds. The predictive free energy of solvation {{was found to be}} lower for sulfonates (6 a-c; 8 a-c) compared to the quaternary ammonium-substituted counterparts, explaining their higher water solubility. In addition, sulfonates showed higher charge dispersability, which may effectively shield the hydrophobicity of isoquinoline nucleus as indicated by hydrophobicity mapping methods. These in silico data underscore efficient net charge balancing, which may explain higher water solubility and thus enhanced antiproliferative efficacy and improved bioavailability. We observed that 6 b, 8 b and Sc strongly inhibited tubulin polymerization and demonstrated significant antiproliferative activity against four cancer cell lines compared to noscapine. Molecular simulation and docking studies of tubulin-drug complexes revealed that the <b>brominated</b> <b>compound</b> with a four-carbon chain (4 b, 6 b, and 8 b) showed optimal binding with tubulin heterodimers. Interestingly, 6 b, 8 b and Sc treated PC- 3 cells resulted in preponderance of mitotic cells with multipolar spindle morphology, suggesting that they stall the cell cycle. Furthermore, in vivo pharmacokinetic evaluation of 6 b, 8 b and Sc revealed at least 1 - 2 -fold improvement in their bioavailability compared to noscapine.

40|$|When {{reporting}} circulating {{levels of}} {{persistent organic pollutants}} (POPs), usually lipid-normalized values are given. However, animal experiments and some human data indicate that exposure to POPs may change lipid values. The aim {{of the present study}} is to investigate if POP levels can predict future changes in levels of circulating lipids. In the population-based Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) study, lipids were measured at age 70 and at age 75 in 598 subjects without lipid-lowering medication. Twenty-three different POPs, including 16 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), five organochlorine pesticides, one dioxin (OCDD) and one flame retardant <b>brominated</b> <b>compound</b> (BDE 47) were analyzed by high-resolution chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS) at age 70. Strong relationships were seen among the baseline levels of the non-dioxin-like PCBs 194, 206 and 209 and the degree of increase in total serum cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol during the 5 year follow-up. These relationships were generally stronger when lipid-normalized levels were used compared to wet-weight based levels. On the contrary, for two of the pesticides, hexachlorobenzene and trans-nonachlordane, levels were inversely related to the change in LDL-cholesterol, with strongest associations found using wet-weight based levels. PCBs 194, 206 and 209 were inversely related to the change in HDL-cholesterol, in particular for wet-weight based levels. However, these relationships were only significant for wet-weight PCB 194 following adjustment for multiple testing. None of the POPs was related to the change in serum triglycerides. When investigating the association between the change in total serum cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol across different categories of change in BMI, we noted robust results especially in the group with stable BMI, suggesting that the observed relationships were not due to fluctuations in BMI over time. In conclusion, POPs are related to the change in lipids over time, especially LDL-cholesterol. This may explain why POP exposure previously has been linked to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease...|$|E

This is a further example of an organometallic compound where an olefin, in this case hexafluorobutadiene, is co-ordinated to the metal atom by one olefin bond to form what may be described as a 'metallo-cyclopropane'ring.

In the first of these compounds the cyclopropabenzene system is not quite planar and the phenyl substituents are twisted and bent from the plane of the benzene ring in the cyclopropabenzene system.

The indolo[2, 1 -a]isoquinoline and its analogues {{have been reported to}} possess antileukemic, tubulin polymerization inhibitory and antitumor activity. A variety of indolo[2, 1 -a]isoquinolines have been synthesized in our labs. This includes, the 5, 12 -dimethyl- 6 -phenylindolo[2, 1 -a]isoquinoline, using the Suzuki- Miyaura cross-coupling reaction and reaction conditions for the formation of aromatic rings (KOBut in DMF) developed in our laboratories. In this dissertation, we outline the syntheses of (±) - 5, 6 -dihydro- 6 -phenylindolo[2, 1 -a]isoquinolin- 5 -ol and 2 -(1 -benzyl- 1 H-benzo[d]imidazol- 2 -yl) benzaldehyde. We also discuss the synthesis and the modelling studies, (docked in silico) of the 3 -substituted oxindoles in the X-ray crystal structure of the PfPK 5 cyclin dependent kinase (CDK). The synthesis of indolo[2, 1 -a]isoquinolines started with N-protection of isatin and benzimidazole with a benzyl group to afford 1 -benzylindoline- 2, 3 -dione and 1 - benzyl- 1 H-benzo[d]imidazole, respectively. The next step was the synthesis of the <b>brominated</b> <b>compound,</b> 1 -benzyl- 2 -bromo- 1 H-indole, and the iodated compound, 1 -benzyl- 2 -iodo- 1 H-benzo[d]imidazole. 1 -Benzyl- 2 -bromo- 1 H-indole was synthesized by means of a functional group interconversion of the oxygen in the 3 -position of isatin to two chlorine atoms initially, followed by removal of those chlorine atoms with activated zinc, followed by the conversion of the carbonyl of the oxindole to give a 2 -bromoindole using POBr 3. 1 -Benzyl- 2 -iodo- 1 Hbenzo[d]imidazole was synthesized in two ways.

30|$|Marine {{organisms are}} {{rich source of}} {{structurally}} novel and biologically active metabolites. Some {{studies have suggested that}} some bioactive compounds isolated from marine organisms have been shown to have anticancer, anthelmintic, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antimalarial, anticoagulant, antiprotozoal, antituberculosis, or anti-inflammatory and other pharmacological activities (Mayer and Hamann 2005; Blunt et al. 2005; Somnath and Ghosh 2010). Many bioactive compounds have been obtained from various marine animals like sea hares, nudibranchs, bryozoans, tunicates, sponges, soft corals, sea slugs and marine microorganisms, etc (Donia and Hamann 2003). Among marine invertebrates, Porifera (sponges) remain the most prolific phylum, concerning novel pharmacologically active compounds (Faulkner 2000). Richter (1907) outlined that the active component of the roasted bath sponge, used by Roger against Struma, is iodine. The work on sponge natural products was systematically started by who isolated three nucleosides from the Caribbean sponge Cryptotethyacrypta laubenfels. Antiviral properties of these nucleosides were demonstrated later (Privat et al. 1964) and initiated the synthesis of analogues which led to the first antiviral compound Ara-A (active against herpes virus) and antitumor compound Ara-C (effective in acute lymphoid leukemia). The compounds Ara-A and Ara-C are the only marine invertebrate-related compounds in clinical use (Guyot 2000). Arabinosyl Cytosine (Ara-C) is currently sold by the Pharmacia & Upjohn Company under the brand name Cytosar-UR. Since this pioneering work, number of novel bioactive molecules have been discovered from this group, which include cytotoxins, antibiotics, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory compounds. It is known that sponges the most diverse marine invertebrates have evolved antagonistic effects against other invading organisms, which involves the production of the secondary metabolites (Wah et al. 2006). The secondary metabolites isolated from marine sponges may be alternative source for vector control agents to replace existing and highly toxic synthetic insecticides and will {{play an important role in}} future insecticide development program (Rao et al. 2008). Initial experimental results suggested that sponges have the potential to provide future drugs against important diseases, such as cancer, a range of viral diseases, malaria, and inflammations (Perdicaris et al. 2013). Also, some of the most potential sponge-derived bioactive molecules include the anti-inflammatory compound Manolide from the Palauan sponge Luffariella variabilis (De-Silva and Scheuer 1980), the immunosuppressive and cytotoxic compound Discodermolide from the deep sea sponge Discodermia dissolute (Gunasekera et al. 1990), anti-angiogenic <b>brominated</b> <b>compound</b> aeroplysina- 1 from a sponge Aplysina aerophoba (Rodriguez-Nieto et al. 2002), tubulin polymerizing compound dictyostatin- 1, a polyketide from Spongia sp. (Isbrucker et al. 2003) etc. Therefore, the present study aims to extract bioactive substances from marine sponges species inhabiting Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea, Egypt in a hope to be used as potential medical agents in several applications (such as; antiviral, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antitumor, and anti-inflammatory).|$|E
40|$|Abstract This study investigates four {{halogenated}} substances; three polyfluorinated {{compounds and}} one brominated substance. The polyfluorinated compounds, namely 6 : 2 fluorotelomer alcohol (6 : 2 FTOH), 8 : 2 fluorotelomer alcohol (8 : 2 FTOH) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), are widespread anthropogenic compounds, {{used in a}} variety of consumer products due to their water-, grease- and stain-repellent property. Levels of PFOA in human blood are typically around 5 ppb (0. 01 μM), while FTOHs so far not have been measured in human samples due to technical difficulties. One of the main effect of PFOA in laboratory animals and in in vitro experiments is an induction of peroxisomal proliferation, leading to increased oxidation of fat, changed expression of a variety of genes, and increased cell proliferation, possibly inducing cancer development, both in the liver and in the pancreas and testicle. PFOA is also a reproductive toxicant, changes membrane architecture, and inhibits the effluent transporter Pgp. Several {{of the effects of the}} FTOHs are similar to those observed after PFOA exposure and several of the genes that show altered expression after PFOA exposure are also changed after exposure to 8 : 2 FTOH. Effects of 8 : 2 FTOH exposure include hepatocellular necrosis and peroxisomal proliferation, as well as detrimental effects on development in mice. Both 6 : 2 and 8 : 2 FTOH have been shown to act as xenoestrogens in vitro. We evaluated the effect of 6 : 2, 8 : 2 FTOH and PFOA on testicular cells from Wistar rats. Testicular cells were exposed in vitro to concentrations up to 300 μM for one hour. No signs of cytotoxicity were observed. The level of single strand breaks, abasic sites and oxidized purines was not increased, either. Whether the expression of the breast cancer resistant protein (Bcrp 1) was altered, remains unsure due to high variability between experimental runs. One major weakness in these experiments is the use of a relatively short exposure time, making it very difficult to draw conclusions. Since the tested concentrations are many magnitudes higher than exposure in the general population, the data have nonetheless predictive value. Taken together, the results suggest that the tested PFCs do not exhibit testicular toxicity. The <b>brominated</b> <b>compound</b> 1, 2 -dibromo- 3 -chloropropane (DBCP) is known to induce permanent or temporary infertility in men, in addition to being a renal toxicant. It also induced DNA damage and acts as a clastogen and mutagen, inducing cancer development. The DNA inducing effect of DBCP on three testicular cell types was evaluated; Sertoli cells and other somatic cells seem to be the most sensitive cell type, spermatogonia the least sensitive, and spermatids seem to have a medium sensitivity. However whether the results obtained in experiments with somatic cells are correct is quite uncertain due to prolonged perincubation time. The repair capacity in spermatogonia and spermatids was also examined; spermatogonia were found to repair DNA damage induced by DBCP somehow faster than spermatids. Taken together, the results suggest that it may be the supporting cells like Sertoli cells that get heaviest damaged by DBCP. The damage in these cells can then lead to impaired germ cell development by interfering with the supply of nutrition, testosterone and other supporting functions. Spermatogonia appear to be least sensitive and repair the induced DNA damage relatively effectively. Since these cells are located outside of the blood-testis barrier these efficient defense mechanisms are very meaningful...|$|E

40|$|Part A: Synthesis of acetophenones with {{possible}} applications in anthocyanin synthesis. The preparations of 4 acetophenones were investigated: 4 -Hydroxy- 3, 5 -dimethoxyacetophenone, 3, 4 -dihydroxy- 5 -methoxyacetophenone, 3, 4, 5 -trihydroxyacetophenone and 3, 4 -dihydroxyacetophenone. These acetophenones {{can be used}} to synthesize the natural occurring anthocyanins: Malvidin 3 -O-β-D-glucopyranoside chloride, petunidin 3 -O-β-D-glucopyranoside chloride, delphinidin 3 -O-β-D-glucopyranoside chloride and cyanidin 3 -O-β-D-glucopyranoside chloride, respectively. 3, 4 -Dihydroxyacetophenone with 2 different protection groups was prepared with 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid as starting material. The ketones were prepared from the corresponding acids by a reaction with methyllithium. This investigation showed that both benzyloxy- and diphenylmethylenedioxy protection are applicable for this reaction. 4 -Hydroxy- 3, 5 -dimethoxyacetophenone, 3, 4 -dihydroxy- 5 -methoxyacetophenone and 3, 4, 5 -trihydroxyacetophenone were prepared by using an Ullmann-type coupling approach. One type of Ullmann-type coupling was able to replace bromine or iodine with a hydroxy group. This reaction was used to prepare 3, 4 -dihydroxy- 5 -methoxyacetophenone and 3, 4, 5 -trihydroxyacetophenone. 4 -Hydroxy- 3, 5 -dimethoxyacetophenone was prepared by an Ullmann-type coupling which replaced iodine with a methoxy group. Except for the preparation of 4 -hydroxy- 3, 5 -dimethoxyacetophenone, Ullmann-type couplings were found to be too “messy” and work in too low yields to effectively prepare larger amounts of the target acetophenones. 3, 4 -Dihydroxy- 5 -methoxyacetophenone was also prepared from 3 -amino- 4 -hydroxy- 5 -methoxyacetophenone by employing a diazonium reaction. The amine was prepared in 2 steps with acetovanillone as starting material. Unfortunately, the diazonium reaction worked in a very low yield and this strategy is therefore not usable to prepare sufficient amounts of 3, 4 -dihydroxy- 5 -methoxyacetophenone. Formylation of acetovanillone followed by Dakin oxidation was another strategy attempted to prepare 3, 4 -dihydroxy- 5 -methoxyacetophenone. Despite several attempts, the formylation of acetovanillone could not be accomplished. There was made an attempt to prepare 3, 4, 5 -trimethoxyacetophenone by a Friedel-Crafts approach. Direct acylation of 1, 2, 3 -trimethoxybenzene gives substitution at the wrong position. The undesired positions were therefore first blocked by bromine before acylation was attempted. Unfortunately, the <b>brominated</b> <b>compound</b> resisted all attempts at acylation. Part B: Synthesis and ring opening of selected strained gem-dihalocyclopropyl ethers Typically, gem-dihalocyclopropyl ethers can be ring opened by alkoxides to give vinylic acetals. For instance, 2, 2 -dichlorocyclopropyl ethyl ether undergoes ring opening with ethoxide in ethanol to give 2 -chloro- 3, 3 -diethoxy- 1 -propene. The gem-dihalocyclopropyl ethers investigated in this thesis were strained, fused ring systems. These compounds {{can be used to}} study how ring opening takes place under strained conditions, and if ring opening will take place at all. This investigation is based on an earlier investigation by Prof. Lars Skattebøl and former M. Sc. student Bjørn Erik Jønsberg. 17, 17 -Dichloro- 13, 16 -dioxa[10. 4. 1]propellane was prepared successfully from cyclododecanone in 3 steps. The dibromo analouge could not be isolated by the Skattebøl research group, but suffered ring opening during its preparation to give 6 -bromo- 1, 4 -dioxaspiro[4. 12]heptadecan- 7 -one. Ring opening with ethoxide in ethanol of 17, 17 -dichloro- 13, 16 -dioxa[10. 4. 1]propellane was attempted. This resulted in an unstable compound which was difficult to purify, but 13 C NMR of the crude product indicated that the dichloro propellane had ring opened similarly to the ring opening described for 2, 2 -dichlorocyclopropyl ethyl ether. In a later attempt, the ring opened product was hydrolyzed with dilute hydrochloric acid to give 2 -chlorocyclotridecane- 1, 3 -dione. This result corresponds to the expected product from hydrolysis of the ring opened dichloropropellane. 13, 13 -Dibromo- 9, 12 -dioxa[6. 4. 1]propellane was prepared successfully from cyclooctanone in 4 steps. Former M. Sc. student Bjørn Erik Jønsberg reported that this compound underwent a reaction with t-BuOK in tetrahydrofuran to give the corresponding monobromine, 13 -bromo- 9, 12 -dioxa[6. 4. 1]propellane. This reaction was attempted with the same conditions, but was unsuccessfull...|$|E
40|$|In {{conjunction}} with horizontal drilling, hydraulic fracturing or fracking has enabled {{the recovery of}} natural gas from low permeable shale formations. In addition to water, these fracking fluids employ proppants and up to 38 different chemical additives to improve {{the efficiency of the}} process. One important class of additives used in hydraulic fracturing is biocides. When applied appropriately, they limit the growth of harmful microorganisms within the well, saving energy producers 4. 5 billion dollars each year. However, biocides or their harmful daughter products may return to the surface in produced water, which must then be appropriately stored, treated and disposed of. Little is known about the effect of mineral-fluid interactions on the fate of the biocides employed in hydraulic fracturing. In this study, we employed laboratory experiments to determine changes in the persistence and products of these biocides under controlled environments. While many minerals are present in shale formations, pyrite, FeS 2 (s) is particularly interesting because of its prevalence and reactivity. The FeII groups on the face of pyrite may be oxidized to form FeIII phases. Both of these surfaces {{have been shown to be}} reactive with organic compounds. Chlorinated compounds undergo redox reactions at the pyrite-fluid interface, and sulfur-containing compounds undergo exceptionally strong sorption to both pristine and oxidized pyrite. This mineral may significantly influence the degradation of biocides in the Marcellus Shale. Thus, the overall goal of this study was to understand the effect of pyrite on biocide reactivity in hydraulic fracturing, focusing on the influence of pyrite on specific functional groups. The first specific objective was to demonstrate the effect of pyrite and pyrite reaction products on the degradation of the bromine-containing biocide, DBNPA. On the addition of pyrite to DBNPA, degradation rates of the doubly <b>brominated</b> <b>compound</b> were found to increase significantly. DBNPA is proposed to undergo redox reactions with the pyrite surface, accepting two-electrons from pyrite, and thus becoming reduced. The primary product is the monobrominated analogue of DBNPA, 2 -monobromo- 3 -nitrilopropionamide (or MBNPA). The surface area-normalized first-order initial degradation rate constant was found to be 5. 1 L. m- 2 day- 1. It was also determined that the dissolution and oxidation products of pyrite, FeII, S 2 O 32 - and SO 42 - are unlikely to contribute to the reduction of the biocide. Taken together, the results illustrate that a surface reaction with pyrite has the ability to reduce the persistence of DBNPA, and as a consequence change the distribution of its reaction products. The second objective was to quantify the influence of water chemistry and interactions with pyrite on the degradation of the sulfur-containing biocide. Dazomet readily hydrolyzes in water due to the nucleophilic attack of hydroxide (OH-) anions. Thus the half-life of dazomet during the shut-in phase of hydraulic fracturing will decrease with increasing pH: 8. 5 hours at pH 4. 1 to 3. 4 hours at pH 8. 2. Dazomet degradation was rapidly accelerated upon exposure to the oxidized pyrite surface, reacting five times faster than hydrolysis in the absence of pyrite at a similar pH. The products measured were identical to those identified on hydrolysis (methyl isothiocyanate and formaldehyde) and no dissolved iron was detected in solutions. This suggests that the dithiocarbamate group in dazomet was able to chemisorb onto the oxidized pyrite surface, shifting the electron density of the molecule which resulted in accelerated hydrolysis of the biocide. The third objective explored the reactivity of various biocide functional groups due to the addition of pyrite. Several elimination mechanisms were identified, and tied to the reactivity of the specific functional group involved. The addition of pyrite led to accelerated degradation of dibromodicyanobutane. This is because the bromine (-Br) group is easily reduced. For methylene bis(thiocyanate), hydrolysis was a noteworthy elimination mechanism since the thiocyanate (-SCN) functionality is a good leaving group. Benzisothiazolinone and methyl isothiazolinone were stable at low pH due to the stabilizing donor-acceptor interactions between the organic biocides’ carbonyl (–C=O) groups and salts in the solution. This body of work has illustrated that pristine pyrite can undergo redox reactions with brominated biocides used in hydraulic fracturing, reducing their persistence and altering the product distribution. This will change the efficacy and the risks associated with the use of these biocides in shales containing pyrite, particularly at lower pH where organic compounds are more stable to hydrolysis. However, at higher pH hydrolysis becomes more important, and additional studies will need to be conducted to investigate the pyrite contribution under these conditions. Conversely, the FeIII surface groups on oxidized pyrite can catalyze the hydrolysis of dazomet and may do so for other labile, sulfur-containing biocides as well. Overall, this research has shown that the physicochemical properties (such as the acid dissociation constant and the standard reduction potential) that govern the environmental reactivity of a molecule can be used to anticipate its reactivity in hydraulic fracturing...|$|E

These enzymes specifically oxidize halides in the presence of hydrogen peroxide into hypohalous acids. These reactive halogen intermediates will react rapidly and aspecifically with many organic molecules.
