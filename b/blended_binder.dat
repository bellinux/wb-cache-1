A new synthesis procedure of alkali-activated <b>blended</b> <b>binder</b> based on the alkaline activation of aluminosilicate materials at ambient temperature, was investigated by using a non corrosive alkaline activator (combination of sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide). In order to enlarge the potential applications and to produce more eco-friendly, and less energy consuming binders, two cementitious systems using metakaolin on the one hand and combinations of metakaolin and clays or industrial by-products on the other hand, were prepared to evaluate the mechanical strength development of the resulting alkali-activated binary <b>blended</b> <b>binder</b> mortars. The measured flexural and compressive strength development of binary <b>blended</b> <b>binder</b> mortars were controlled through the dosage of the alkaline activator and the choice of the raw materials. In addition, this paper has assessed the effect of a new type of superplasticizer on the mechanical strengths of various alkali-activated binder mortars. The results indicate that the addition of small amount of superplasticizer has a significant influence on the mechanical strength development of the alkali-activated binary <b>blended</b> <b>binder</b> mortars. This research is of practical interest for civil engineering applications, since alkali-activated cementitious materials could be used in the future as an eco-friendly sustainable construction material alternative to ordinary Portland cement...|$|E

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{investigation was}} performed to study the effect of reclaimed asphalt with polymer modified bitumen on the properties describing asphalt performance. Three types of asphalts used for wearing courses in Europe (SMA 11, AC 11 and PA 8) were investigated. Five combinations of reclaimed asphalt, virgin aggregate, paving grade and polymer modified bitumen were tested {{for each type of}} asphalt. The results show the water sensitivity of mixtures containing reclaimed asphalt is expected to meet the requirements. Rutting resistance of the mixtures with reclaimed asphalt and virgin polymer modified bitumen was comparable to the mixture only with virgin polymer modified bitumen. Mixtures with reclaimed asphalt had a higher stiffness compared to the mixtures without reclaimed asphalt. It was also proved the penetration of the <b>blended</b> <b>binder</b> relates to indirect tensile strength and stiffness of mixtures and rutting resistance of asphalts is strongly related to softening point of <b>blended</b> <b>binder.</b> © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{dissertation}} was to study the SHRP Performance-Graded (PG) binder system for selection of recycling agent for asphalt pavement recycling projects. Traditional asphalt cement testing methods such as viscosity and penetration have several shortcomings and could not characterize the binders at {{a wide range of}} temperatures and loading times. The PG system characterizes asphalt cement with cyclic and creep tests {{in a wide range of}} temperatures and loading times. The PG system makes it possible to relate the testing parameters with the asphalt pavement distresses such as fatigue, rutting, and low-temperatures cracking. SHRP did not look at the asphalt pavement recycling. Therefore, it was necessary to study the PG binder system for asphalt recycling. One asphalt cement was selected as the binder in the reclaimed asphalt pavement. Two soft asphalt cements and two recycling agents were selected as the rejuvenator. The original binder was aged in the laboratory and was blended with rejuvenated materials. The resultant 10 <b>blended</b> <b>binders</b> were characterized with a Dynamic Shear Rheometer and a Bending Beam Rheometer apparatus. The testing procedure used involved performing sweep temperatures ranging from - 30 to 70 °C. The PG testing results were used to develop some models for characterization of <b>blended</b> <b>binders.</b> The proposed models are based on PG binder testing parameters such as complex shear modulus (G*), phase Angle (&# 948;), stiffness (S), and m-value. The analysis showed that a linear relationship is accurate enough for prediction of PG binder parameters with a proportion of recycling agents. The temperature dependency of blended lines for complex shear modulus, stiffness, phase angle and m-value was studied. The loading time dependency of <b>blended</b> <b>binders</b> was studied by building the master curves. The SHRP A- 002 A binder model was used for estimating the rheological indexes (R) and crossover frequencies (&# 969;c) of <b>blended</b> <b>binders.</b> The regression analysis showed that a linear relationship is accurate enough for prediction of SHRP A- 002 A parameters with a proportion of recycling agents of <b>blended</b> <b>binders.</b> The temperature dependency of shift factors was studied with defining temperature, Td, from WLF Equation...|$|R
40|$|Ammonium-nitrate-(AN-) based {{composite}} propellants {{prepared with}} a hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) /polytetrahydrofuran (PTHF) <b>blend</b> <b>binder</b> have unique thermal decomposition characteristics. In this study, the burning characteristics of AN/HTPB/PTHF propellants are investigated. The specific impulse and adiabatic flame temperature of an AN-based propellant theoretically increases {{with an increase}} in the proportion of PTHF in the HTPB/PTHF blend. With an AN/HTPB propellant, a solid residue is left on the burning surface of the propellant, and the shape of this residue {{is similar to that of}} the propellant. On the other hand, an AN/HTPB/PTHF propellant does not leave a solid residue. The burning rates of the AN/HTPB/PTHF propellant are not markedly different from those of the AN/HTPB propellant because some of the liquefied HTPB/PTHF binder cover the burning surface and impede decomposition and combustion. The burning rates of an AN/HTPB/PTHF propellant with a burning catalyst are higher than those of an AN/HTPB propellant supplemented with a catalyst. The beneficial effect of the <b>blend</b> <b>binder</b> on the burning characteristics is clarified upon the addition of a catalyst. The catalyst suppresses the negative influence of the liquefied binder that covers the burning surface. Thus, HTPB/PTHF <b>blend</b> <b>binders</b> are useful in improving the performance of AN-based propellants...|$|R

Four PEM mixtures were used: rubberized PEM in dry process, rubberized PEM in wet process, rubberized PEM with terminal <b>blend</b> <b>binder,</b> and control styrene–butadiene–styrene (SBS) modified PEM. Dynamic modulus and direct tension fatigue tests were performed with an asphalt mixture performance tester system. The fatigue test data were analyzed by the simplified viscoelastic continuum damage theory. There were four main results. First, the rutting resistance of the rubberized PEM in the dry process {{was similar to that}} of the wet process but slightly lower than that of the rubberized PEM with the terminal <b>blend</b> <b>binder</b> and SBS modified PEM. Second, the fatigue cracking resistance of the rubberized PEM in the dry process was {{similar to that of the}} wet process but significantly lower than those of the rubberized PEM with the terminal <b>blend</b> <b>binder</b> and SBS modified PEM. Third, the use of smaller size CRM and transpolyoctenamer (TOR) in the dry process may have made the properties of the dry process PEM close to those of the wet process. However, the 10 % CRM or 4. 5 % TOR used in the study could not make rubberized PEMs produce longer fatigue life like the control SBS modified PEM.

40|$|Fine-grained {{soils are}} often {{regarded}} as problematic soils in earthworks {{because of their}} water- and frost sensitivity. Only limited amounts of fine-grained tills are used as earthwork material today. The main objective of this thesis {{is to improve the}} knowledge of how to use and also treat a fine-grained till, so that a greater amount can be utilised as earthwork material. To achieve an increasing use of fine-grained tills, they must be handled in a certain way or treated/modified to achieve the desired properties. This thesis is focused on the compaction- and strength- properties of tills, both untreated and treated with a stabilising agents. Compaction is essential to achieve a good base for foundations for roads, railways and other constructions. To achieve a good result, the water content of the soil to be compacted must be within a certain range. Densification of fine-grained soils at low water contents is about to overcome the soils' “cohesion”. The soils' apparent cohesion is the sum of cohesion and matrix suction. The density increase during compaction is related to the applied compaction energy and the water content of the soils. The results in this study are based on both laboratory investigations and well as field studies. The laboratory results are based on tests performed on 13 different soils. The main type has been clay till but coarser soils such as clayey sand tills have also been studied. The field tests have been performed at two different sites. To conclude: the thesis work shows that fine-grained tills can be used as qualified fills in earthworks, and that the MCA (Moisture Condition Apparatus) has been proven to be a very efficient and accurate tool to predict the properties of a fine-grained till. The relation between the undrained shear strength, cu and MCV (Moisture Condition Value) is expressed by the following equation; cu = 14. 1 *e^(0. 22 *MCV) where cu is the undrained shear strength in kPa. Lime is the main soil-stabilising agent. However, cement may be preferred in cold weather conditions since to the chemical reactions also occur at low temperature. <b>Blended</b> <b>binders</b> have proven to be very efficient and could well compete with single binders and in many cases give a considerably better effect than a single <b>binder.</b> <b>Blended</b> <b>binders</b> have many advantages regarding the binders’ working period. The evaluations of <b>blended</b> <b>binders</b> are preferable performed with response surface methodology (RSM) a statistical evaluation technique that evaluates the interactions between the different agents.

40|$|Coal ash which {{constitute}} of fly ash {{and bottom}} ash were {{proved to be}} used as main component in brick production. However, published work on the coal ash brick with addition of foam in order to produce lightweight brick is still lacking. This thesis reports the effect of variation in foam content in coal ash brick on the density, water absorption and salt attack resistance. Comparison of those parameters was made between the coal ash bricks and conventional brick. The coal ash brick mixes were formulated using industrial by-product, ground granulated blastfurnace slag (GGBS) which is activated with an alkaline (hydrated lime or Portland cement) combined with coal ash from coal-fired thermal power plant. The <b>blended</b> <b>binder</b> comprising of hydrated lime (HL) – GGBS and Portland cement (PC) –GGBS were used to stabilize the coal ash brick. Foam was used to produce lightweight brick. The percentage of foam added to the brick mixes are 25 %, 50 % and 75 %. A total of sixty (60) brick specimen subjected to ten (10) series of mix proportion were cast and put in air curing condition for at least 28 days before testing. The density measurement in accordance with AS/NZS 4456. 8, water absorption test in accordance with BS EN 772 - 21 and salt attack resistance in accordance with AS/NZS 4456. 10 were evaluated on the brick specimens. The results indicated that the density of coal ash brick decreases with the increase in foam content. Also for bricks composed of both <b>blended</b> <b>binder,</b> the water absorption were directly proportional to the amount of foam. Thus, the water absorption of foam brick increases with the reduction in density. Higher foam content leads increase of pores and capillaries in brick structure, therefore the brick become weaker to resist on salt attack. XRD pattern of formed brick with 75 % of foam addition on HL-GGBS coal ash brick portrays ettringite formation were attributed to disruption of brick structure. The use of coal ash with HL–GGBS and PC-GGBS combination as binder agent has been observed to be lightweight, low in water absorption, and advantageous in protection to salt attack compare to the conventional brick. The optimum proportion respected to the foam content is 50 % in balance condition with approximately 1 - 2 % of mass loss due to salt attack, 12 - 13 % of water absorption and density significantly reduced to 1600 kg/m 3...|$|E
40|$|The use of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP), {{sometimes}} called Recycled Asphalt Pavement, in Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) provides many benefits {{and has been}} successfully used in Ontario for several years. The production and usage of this material results in numerous environmental and economic advantages. Using RAP in HMA has various proven benefits including: reuse of high quality materials, saves on dwindling non-renewable aggregate resources, diverts large volumes of materials from overloaded landfills, reduces road building costs and contributes significantly to provincial and municipal recycling obligations. However, the usage of this material is still very conservative. Several challenges can be faced when introducing RAP in HMA, particularly in higher amounts. The characteristics of the RAP, particularly the aged (stiffer) asphalt cement (AC) in the recycled material, can affect {{the performance of the}} mix. The primary concern with increasing RAP percentages in HMA mixes are its effects on endurance against fatigue and thermal cracking. The common question in many agencies within the pavement industry is whether RAP acts as a “black rock” or the aged AC in RAP blends with the new AC in the mix. Accordingly, this research evaluated the impact that RAP in varying percentages has on a conventional Ontario mix, Superpave (SP) 12. 5 mm, and provided some new guidelines on the usage of RAP. Using virgin aggregates and RAP collected from a local contractor, twelve mixtures were modelled in the laboratory, with 0 %, 20 %, and 40 % RAP contents and AC with different Performance Grade (PG). The research also examined how the addition of RAP to HMA alters the performance of the mix, and how HMA can be tested to determine the RAP content. This research intended to answer the following questions: First, can the RAP percentage be determined from the recycled hot mix asphalt characteristics or performance? And second, can the <b>blended</b> <b>binder</b> PG be deduced from performance testing of recycled hot mix? This research demonstrated that is possible to design Superpave mixes incorporating 20 % RAP and 40 % RAP without compromising the specified consensus properties and volumetric characteristics. Based on the results, it was determined that the performance of the recycled hot mixes regarding low temperature cracking, rutting and stiffness, which is related to the fatigue susceptibility of the mix, was simultaneously influenced by the RAP content and the virgin asphalt PG. The effect of the RAP addition was more dramatic for the mixes with virgin binder PG 52 -xx than for the mixes with PG 58 -xx. A method to determine the presence and quantity of RAP was formulated, and also an estimation of the performance grade of the resulting <b>blended</b> <b>binder</b> without extraction and recovery of the asphalt was possible...|$|E
40|$|Wheat straw ash {{coming from}} {{combustion}} of packed wheat straw was studied {{as a potential}} pozzolana active admixture for blended cements. X-Ray fluorescence, X-Ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy were used to examine chemical and mineralogical composition, morphology and elemental distribution of a raw untreated ash. Due to high carbon content, the wheat straw ash was thermally treated for 2 hours at 700 °C and analyzed again using the same analytic techniques. Thermal treatment process was monitored using simultaneous thermal analysis and Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy. The pozzolana activity was assessed using Chapelle and Frattini tests. In the next step, wheat straw ash was used for preparation of blended cement pastes. The content of ash in the blends was 10, 15, and 20 % by mass. For the hardened pastes, basic physical properties, mechanical parameters, and pore size distribution were measured. For fresh past mixes, workability was tested. Moreover, leachability of chlorides, nitrates, sulfates and alkalis from paste samples was studied. The experimentally obtained data pointed to the high pozzolana activity of wheat straw ash and sufficient mechanical properties of cement pastes with the ash content up to 20 mass% of cement.

Furthermore, it is also unclear whether binder modifications {{should be considered in}} the mix design for recycled HMA. The goal of this research was to determine if the current IDOT mix design practice required modification with respect to the use of RAP. A set of mixtures was prepared using RAP in accordance with current practice.

This study found that up to 20 % RAP in HMA does not require a change in binder grade. However, at 40 % RAP in HMA, a binder grade bump at high temperature and possibly at low temperature is needed; more tests are required to verify the need for low temperature binder grade bumping.

40|$|In this study, {{hardening}} {{of calcium}} hydroxide and calcium silicate binders containing rice husk ash (RHA), cement and lime were studied with mortars. Hardening of these <b>blended</b> <b>binders</b> occurs {{as a result}} of combined hydration, pozzolanic reaction and carbonation that occur consecutively. While initial strength development was controlled by the cement hydration, carbonation reaction was favoured at later stage with the decrease in the cement content and increase in the porosity of the blended mortars. Due to their higher porosity, RHA-cement mortars yielded lower strength values than the reference cement mortar. Their compressive and flexural strength increased gradually upon hardening, which indicated a long-term strength development. However, strength reduction was recorded at the very early stage for RHA-cement-lime mortars containing 10 %-wt cement.

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} in designing recycled asphalt mixtures with a high amount of RAP is to estimate the blending degree between RAP binder and the added virgin bitumen. The extent of blending is crucial in this case as asphalt concrete response {{is influenced by the}} final binder properties. This paper focuses on the evaluation of interaction and extent of blending between RAP-binder and virgin bitumen by studying the microstructures of the ‘blending zone’ with atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM is used to probe the change of microstructural properties from a RAP-binder and virgin bitumen to the blending zone of these two. Averaged microstructural properties have been observed in thin film blends of RAP-binder and pure bitumen. The morphology of the blending zone (spatial extent of about 50 ?m) exhibits domains {{of a wide range of}} microstructure sizes from 160 nm to 2. 07 ?m and can be considered to be a completely blended ‘new material’ which has been observed directly for the first time. The fully <b>blended</b> <b>binder</b> properties are found to be in between those of the two individual binders, as could be inferred from the averaged microstructural properties as derived from AFM-images of the blending zone. This is also consistent with the results of mechanical tests by dynamic shear rheometer on the same materials. Finally a design formula is proposed that relates the spatial dimensions of the blending zone to temperature and mixing time. This relation will eventually allow for translating the results of this study from small length scales up to the engineering level. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} an experimental and micromechanical study of high rate recycled asphalt with 70 % of RAP. Rheological measurements of shear complex modulus of virgin, RAP and <b>blended</b> <b>binders</b> were performed at different temperatures and frequencies. Then, a micromechanical model {{based on the}} generalized self-consistent scheme (GSCS) was suggested for the prediction of the effective mechanical properties of the recycled asphalt. The GSCS-based approach aims to homogenize the heterogeneous material {{taking into account the}} intergranular porosity, on the one hand, and the possible interactions between its phases on the other one. The suggested method was compared to a step-by-step (successive) homogenization approach and literature data in elastic case were used for this purpose. The results have shown that the GSCS-based approach presents a good agreement with the data especially for higher volume fractions of aggregates. Furthermore, the significant influence of the blend homogeneity level on the estimation of the effective mechanical properties of the recycled asphalt was highlighted...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the potential of utilizing Pulverised Fual Ash (PFA), an industrial by-products, waste aluminium and waste gypsum from plasterboard, with <b>blended</b> <b>binders</b> Lime-GGBS (Ground Granulated Blastfurnace Slag) or PC (Portland Cement) –GGBS, into the development of lightweight building components. Powder aluminium was used to produce hydrogen for lightweight effects. The engineering properties of unconfined compressive strength (UCS) was investigated. Concrete cubes of control systems (PFA+binders), unfoamed systems (PFA+ binders+gypsum), foamed systems (PFA+binders+Aluminium) and combined systems (PFA+binders+Aluminium and Gypsum) were made under controlled laboratory conditions and cured for 7 and 28 days before testing for UCS. The results obtained showed that the control and unfoamed systems recorded higher strength values than the foamed and combined systems. Strength values are linearly related to density of foamed concrete. There are technological, economic as well as environmental advantages of utilizing PFA and similar industrial by-products, in the development of foamed lightweight building components. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates the {{potential}} re-use options for {{a suite of}} low rank brown coal fly ashes (ASTM class C fly ash) as feedstock for geopolymer binder synthesis. Ash suitability was evaluated using a number of conventional characterisation tools including XRF, calorimetric and microscopy to analyse solid phase distribution in relation to compositional differences derived from ternary diagram analogues. Blends of brown coal ash with selected black coal fly ash (class F) and blast furnace slag were developed for compressive strength and durability tests. The study show that brown coal fly ash with higher Al content improved the rate of reaction of <b>blended</b> <b>binders</b> and that observed high contents of sulphate and magnesium oxides available in some brown coal fly ashes induced accelerated decomposition in high moist environments. Overall, it was evident from both microscopy and mineralogical analysis of binder mixtures that brown coal fly ash participate in geopolymer network formation rather than act as filler material. Factors influencing brown coal ash reactivity {{and the potential for}} incorporating this class of ash in developing stable and usable geopolymer binder systems are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Insitu {{cementitious}} stabilisation is an economical, environmentally sustainable {{and socially}} advantageous means of rehabilitating pavements. With the recent {{availability of a}} wide range of binders and advanced construction equipment, the characterisation of cementitiously stabilised pavement materials has become the focus of further advancement of this technology. Australian practice has moved towards the use of Indirect Diametric Tensile (IDT) methods for the characterisation of these materials. A draft protocol for the IDT test has been prepared and specifies samples to be compacted by gyratory compactor. This procedure provides for both monotonic and repeated load testing, which aims to measure the material’s strength, modulus and fatigue life. A range of host materials, including a new crushed rock and a reclaimed existing pavement base course, were assessed when stabilised with a General Purpose cement binder as well as with a slag-lime <b>blended</b> <b>binder.</b> Materials were assess for their inherent material properties, Unconfined Compression Strength (UCS), Unconfined Compression modulus, IDT strength and modulus under both monotonic and repeated load. A number of amendments and refinements to the testing protocol were recommended. These included the use of minimum binder contents to ensure the binder was uniformly distributed and to promote heavy binding of the materials to ensure they behaved elastically. It was also recommended that samples be gyratory compacted to a pre-determined sample height to allow a constant density to be achieved. The variability of the test results was examined. UCS results were found to be comparatively as variable as other researchers had reported. IDT strength results contained a similar level of variability, which was considered to be acceptable. Modulus results, both monotonic and repeated load, were found to be five to ten times more variable than strength results, which is a generally accepted trend for modulus testing. Under repeated loading, some challenges with the test protocol were encountered. The primary challenge was obtaining reliable and repeatable diametrical displacement data for modulus calculation. This was partially overcome by the insertion of smooth spacers to prevent the Linear Voltage Displacement Transformer (LVDTs) becoming caught on the sample sides. The achievement of reliable and repeatable IDT modulus results through improved displacement measurements should be the focus of future research efforts in this area...|$|E
40|$|Wastewater {{conveyance}} {{and treatment}} facilities, which include outfall sewers, manholes, and treatment works, {{are among the}} key constituents of a country's infrastructure. Most of these facilities are made of concrete due to its low production costs, versatility, inherent strength and durability under most conditions. However, under certain conditions, sewage that is conveyed through outfall sewers becomes septic and hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) gas is generated. When this gas is released from the sewage and absorbed onto the moist concrete sewer pipe walls, it is microbially converted by sulphide-oxidising bacteria to sulphuric acid (biogenic H 2 SO 4) which reacts with the acid-soluble components of concrete causing it to corrode. In principle, the biogenic H 2 SO 4 concrete corrosion mechanism entails simultaneous destruction of the calcium hydroxide (CH) in the hydrated cement paste (HCP) and substituting a larger molecule of calcium sulphate into the concrete matrix thus causing pressure and spalling of the adjacent concrete and aggregate particles. In addition, the calcium sulphate precipitates as gypsum which reacts with various aluminates to form secondary ettringite. These mechanisms lead {{to the loss of}} stiffness and strength, accompanied by expansion and cracking, and eventually transformation of the affected concrete matrix into a soft and pulpy non-cohesive layer. The biogenic concrete corrosion rate depends, inter alia, on the chemical composition of binders (cement and supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs)) and microstructural characteristics of concrete mixtures used in the manufacture of sewer pipes. The needed properties of concrete mixtures for sewer pipe applications can be determined by biogenic corrosion prediction models, such as the widely used deterministic (mechanistic) Life Factor Method (LFM). The service life of wastewater treatment facilities made of concrete depends on the input parameters in corrosion prediction models. The motivation behind the current study was based on the need to improve the ability to predict the design life of concrete sewers by improving the input parameters in the LFM, which is used in South Africa. The design life of concrete sewers in South Africa has traditionally been 40 years. The main objective of the current study was to characterise the microstructure of both Portland cement (PC) and calcium aluminate cement (CAC) based concrete mixtures that had been subjected to biogenic corrosion mechanisms in an operational sewer environment for approximately 127 months (10 ½ years); further, based on the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of attack, proposals were made to improve the LFM, for which the corrosion rate-controlling input parameter, referred to as alkalinity (or equivalent CaCO 3, as a summation for both binder and aggregate) is based on the characteristics of plain PC-based binder systems. In addition to the main objective above, a parallel study was undertaken to characterise parameters that influence biogenic concrete corrosion rates based on measurements taken in two sewer environments/sites in different geographical locations in South Africa. One of the study sites was the Virginia Experimental Sewer (VES) in Virginia, Free State Province, while the other site was a manhole within the Langa Pump Station in Cape Town, Western Cape Province. The VES consists of 900 mm diameter by 300 mm long concrete pipe samples made from both PC- and CAC-based (plain and <b>blended)</b> <b>binder</b> systems, the top 120 ° being cut to form 'lids', so that they are removable. The removable 'lids' enable scheduled observations and sample recovery to be undertaken. Moreover, the 'lids' also act as windows through which core samples can be placed in plastic baskets that are hung at certain sections in the sewer headspace, {{so that they can be}} accessed for monitoring...|$|E
