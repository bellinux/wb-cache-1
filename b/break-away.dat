5|$|In February 1968, Lindsay {{estimated}} that there were about 500 to 700 Five Percenters. Some of Clarence13X's followers attempted to create <b>break-away</b> groups, proclaiming themselves prophets and starting their own movements. They generally retained aspects of Five Percenter doctrine with different emphases.|$|E
5|$|Moldova, Ukraine and Georgia {{have been}} offered by both the European Union and the Eurasian Economic Union to join their {{integration}} unions. All three countries opted for the European Union by signing association agreements on 21 March 2014. However, <b>break-away</b> regions of Moldova (Transnistria), Ukraine (Donetsk and Lugansk) and Georgia (South Ossetia and Abkhazia) have {{expressed a desire to}} join the Eurasian Customs Union and integrate into the Eurasian Economic Union.|$|E
5|$|In {{the centuries}} that {{followed}} the Reformation, many religious denominations came to Glastonbury to establish chapels and meeting houses. For such a relatively small town, Glastonbury has a remarkably diverse history of Christian places of worship, further enriched {{by the fact that}} several of these movements saw <b>break-away</b> factions, typically setting up new meeting places as a result of doctrinal disagreements, leaving behind them a legacy which would require a highly specialized degree of study in order to chart their respective histories and places of practice. Amongst their number have been Puritans/Undetermined Protestants, Quakers, Independents, Baptists, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Wesleyan and Primitive Methodists, Salvationists, Plymouth Brethren, Jehovah's Witnesses and Pentecostals.|$|E

25|$|Maechler {{kept the}} lead for several stages. After stage nine, Maechler was still leading. The mass-start stages were {{dominated}} by <b>break-aways</b> of cyclists who were not considered relevant for the final victory; sixth-placed Charly Mottet was the only cyclist in the top 15 who had real chances of finishing high.|$|R
50|$|This {{station was}} {{originally}} known as WPHB-FM, first signing {{on the air}} in 1989 from the studios of its co-owned AM station with the same call letters. Both stations simulcast a classic country music format for approximately half of the broadcast day, with <b>break-aways</b> during the daytime hours for WPHB (AM)'s more Christian-based programming.|$|R
5|$|Members of the Republican Army who {{had come}} from Indonesian Hizbullah felt betrayed by the Indonesian Government. In May 1948, they {{declared}} a <b>break-away</b> regime, the Negara Islam Indonesia (Indonesian Islamic State), better known as Darul Islam. Led by an Islamic mystic, Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwirjo, Darul Islam sought to establish Indonesia as an Islamic theocracy. At the time, the Republican Government did not respond, as they were focused on the threat from the Dutch. Some leaders of Masjumi sympathised with the rebellion. After the Republic regained all territories in 1950, the government took the Darul Islam threat seriously, especially after some provinces declared that they had joined Darul Islam. The rebellion was put down in 1962.|$|E
5|$|Juventus have {{significant}} rivalries with two clubs. Their traditional rivals are fellow Turin club Torino and matches {{between the two}} side are known as the Derby della Mole (Turin Derby). The rivalry dates back to 1906 as Torino was founded by <b>break-away</b> Juventus players and staff. Their most high-profile rivalry is with Internazionale, another big Serie A club located in Milan, {{the capital of the}} neighbouring region of Lombardy. Matches between these two clubs are referred to as the Derby d'Italia (Derby of Italy) and the two regularly challenge each other {{at the top of the}} league table, hence the intense rivalry. Until the Calciopoli scandal which saw Juventus forcibly relegated, the two were the only Italian clubs to have never played below Serie A. Notably, the two sides are the first and the second most supported clubs in Italy and the rivalry has intensified since the later part of the 1990s; reaching its highest levels ever post-Calciopoli, with the return of Juventus to Serie A. They also have rivalries with Milan, Roma, Fiorentina and Napoli.|$|E
5|$|Team Canada {{responded to}} their {{previous}} defeat with strong {{play in this}} game. The first period was scoreless, but the Canadians used the period to intimidate the Soviets with hard body checking, especially from Cashman, Bergman, Peter Mahovlich and Parise, to throw the Soviets off their game. In the second period, the first goal of the match was again scored by Esposito, this time from a feed from his regular Bruins' linemate Cashman, who had retrieved the puck deep in the Soviets' zone after colliding with the Soviets' defenceman Vladimir Lutchenko. In the third period, Yvan Cournoyer wheeled around Alexander Ragulin and beat Tretiak. Yakushev got the Soviets on the board after teammate Yevgeni Zimin missed on a <b>break-away.</b> Lyapkin pounced on the rebound and fed it out front for Yakushev to bury the puck behind Esposito. Peter Mahovlich then scored a critical goal while Canada was short-handed, deking out the Soviet defender one-on-one, then Tretiak, to give Canada a two-goal lead. His brother Frank then finished the scoring on a feed from Mikita, who had circled around a Soviets' defenceman. Team Canada won the game 4–1 and tied the series.|$|E
500|$|The {{magazine}} Cycling Weekly {{commented on}} the race by criticising the route as [...] "more attritional [...] than it is tactical", citing the lack of attacks and the teams' reluctance to send riders into <b>break-aways.</b> Reporter Stephen Puddicombe also criticised Niki Terpstra for not attacking Kristoff before the finish, writing: [...] "Did Terpstra really believe he had any hope of winning the two-man sprint {{against one of the}} quickest finishers in the world?" ...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} recent studies measure trade union {{membership}} concentration using the Herfindahl index. This study uses the same measure to examine the relative effects of the different factors that influenced the level of British union membership concentration between 1892 and 1987. Five factors are identified as influencing this development: mergers, formations, dissolutions, <b>break-aways,</b> and membership change. Marked occupational differences in the relative effect of these factors are shown. In aggregate terms, mergers and membership change tend to be complementary in effect until 1946 and counteractive thereafter...|$|R
50|$|This station debuted on 99.3 as WVEN-FM on March 5, 1971, as {{a partial}} {{simulcast}} of AM affiliate WFRA, with occasional <b>break-aways</b> {{for its own}} original programming that closely mirrored WFRA, usually during periods of the broadcast day when WFRA offered talk and news-intensive programming. As more and more cars became equipped with FM radios, the two radio stations broke {{away from each other}} and became completely separate programming operations, though WVEN would recapture the call letters of its sister AM station in 1989.|$|R
25|$|The prologue was won by {{specialist}} Jelle Nijdam, {{and none}} of the favourites lost much time. The second place in the prologue was for Polish cyclist Lech Piasecki, and when he was part of a <b>break-away</b> in the first stage that won a few seconds, he became the new leader in the general classification, the first time that an Eastern-European cyclist lead the Tour de France. Piasecki kept his lead in the team time trial of stage 2, but lost it in the third stage when a <b>break-away</b> gained several minutes. Erich Maechler became the new leader.|$|E
25|$|The match {{became the}} first, {{and so far}} only, world {{championship}} match to be abandoned without result. Kasparov's relations with Campomanes and FIDE were greatly strained, and the feud between them finally {{came to a head}} in 1993 with Kasparov's complete <b>break-away</b> from FIDE.|$|E

50|$|After being {{expelled}} from the party, {{the members of the}} Appeal Group aimed to recruit supporters from inside and outside the CPGB to fight on an anti-revisionist platform. They met up to four times a week in a council flat overlooking Charlton Athletic football ground for several years. In its first years the group grew a little, but there were never more than about 30 members at any one time, though well over 100 people, from all around the country, had some brief association with it. Some of these later went on to be involved with the New Communist Party and other <b>break-aways</b> from the CPGB.|$|R
25|$|Dravidian parties rose {{to power}} and {{prominence}} in the political stage of Tamil Nadu, a state in India, in the 1960s. The rise in power and political support was gradual until Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a Dravidian party, formed {{the government in the}} state in 1967. Although since the 1970s the Dravidian parties have met with many <b>break-aways</b> and have taken rival stances against each other, the seat of power in Tamil Nadu has been with one or another Dravidian party. The increase in popularity of the Dravidian parties in the 1960s is attributed to several factors, including the fall of popularity of the Congress Government in the centre and the North-South disparity, as claimed by the Dravidian politics. The series of events climaxed with anti-Hindi agitation which led to the downfall of popularity of the then Indian National Congress government in the state and the eventual rise of Dravidian parties to power.|$|R
5000|$|McMillan {{grew up in}} Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, {{where he}} played center for the Moose Jaw Monarchs. In April 1945, the Monarchs {{traveled}} to Lethbridge, Alberta to play the Lethbridge Native Sons for the western Canada juvenile hockey championship. [...] McMillan, described as the team's [...] "star centre" [...] and a [...] "starry redhead who is the mainspring of the Moose Jaw attack," [...] was left behind in Moose Jaw because his father was seriously ill. [...] However, he arrived in Lethbridge by plane {{on the morning of}} the first game, and scored four goals and an assist, as his heads-up hockey and [...] "fast <b>break-aways</b> kept the crowd in a dither." [...] The Monarchs won the series in two games, and McMillan was the high scorer with six goals and an assist. [...] One month after the championship, McMillan's 42-year-old father, a hockey coach who had been recently discharged from the Royal Canadian Air Force, died in Moose Jaw.|$|R

40|$|If {{the idea}} of an {{obstacle}} is broadly interpreted every object which is {{in the way of a}} vehicle can be regarded as an obstacle. According to this definition all road users are also obstacles. In this literature study only exclusive fixed objects along the highway, such as lighting poles and columns for fly overs are considered. All of these have a useful function, but can produce danger for the road users by their position and design. It is established that the presence of obstacles on road shoulders increases the number and severity of collisions with obstacles. A literature review has been carried out on the behaviour in collisions of fixed objects which are on road shoulders. In principle research is focussed on the creation of a safe road shoulder by (1) the construction of safety fences, (2) the protection of the other obstacles by so called obstacle safety devices, (3) the construction of <b>break-aways</b> and base slip-joints, and (4) making the road shoulder free of obstacles. In a second part of the paper tables and figures are presented. See also B 1466...|$|R
5|$|MacLachlan did {{not take}} to his new posting and was eager {{to get back to}} the action. MacLachlan volunteered for service with RAF Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain which had begun in July 1940. He learned on the 18 August that he had been one of five pilots chosen from 88 Squadron to retrain as fighter pilots. He was posted to RAF Drem for {{training}} with No. 145 Squadron. He flew a Hawker Hurricane fighter for the first time days later on 22 August. Within nine days he had logged 18 hours in the type. On 3 September he was given official leave to travel to London. There he received his DFC at Buckingham Palace. He returned to No. 145 shortly afterwards and was based at RAF Tangmere, Croydon and Westhampnett. No. 11 Group RAF was in the thick of the fighting and suffered many casualties. MacLachlan and his group were to replace the many pilots killed or wounded. MacLachlan practiced operational take-offs, fighter tactics, radio control, <b>break-aways</b> and dogfights—the essence of air-to-air combat. He was sent on patrols on 30 August, but only over Scotland, to guard against attacks from Luftflotte 5 (Air Fleet 5) based in Norway. No interceptions were made as air combat was rare in the north. On 21 September MacLachlan survived a force-landing at Dyce, caused by an oil leak. On 27 September 1940 MacLachlan was posted to the south at Debden, arriving two days later. He was then assigned to No. 73 Squadron RAF at RAF Castle Camps.|$|R

25|$|However, the Institute's {{intentions}} were paternal and no democratic control by its students was intended. In 1829, radical Rowland Detrosier led a breakaway group {{to form the}} New Mechanics' Institution in Poole Street, a move that had a serious effect on the recruitment and finances of the original institute. Subscriptions and memberships in 1830–31 were an all-time low and only the gradual opening of the board up to election by the members rectified the situation. Detrosier's <b>break-away</b> ultimately rejoined the Institute.|$|E

By 1959 the show was carried by 150 affiliates, but rarely won its time slot, competing with such heavyweights as The Perry Como Show on NBC; and on CBS, The Honeymooners, Perry Mason, and in 1960, the top-rated Gunsmoke. Its ratings were also hampered when a few major-market affiliates such as WABC-TV took advantage of network <b>break-away</b> cues to carry 30- or, when it was 90 minutes, 60-minute portions.|$|E
25|$|In {{the state}} {{legislative}} elections held simultaneously, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) {{emerged as a}} major party in Kerala and West Bengal.

He took part in many attacks, before the first rest day on the 9th stage, he finally got in a <b>break-away</b> that lasted to the line. He finished third, 3 minutes ahead of Armstrong. Voigt's time in the maillot jaune would be short-lived however, as he fell to 168th at stage 10 after a fever, and he was eliminated for failing to finish stage 11 within the time limit. Voigt ended 2005 as 29th on the UCI ProTour individual rankings.|$|E
25|$|Even {{after the}} party split, Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Communist Party cadres {{remained}} unified in the All India Trade Union Congress. After the short-lived coexistence between both the Parties broke down in Kerala and also in West Bengal similar rupture happened, the trade union wing also split. In December 1969, eight Communist Party of India (Marxist) members walked out of an All India Trade Union Congress executive committee meeting. Later, the Marxist <b>break-away</b> members would organise an All India Trade Union Conference in Calcutta, on 28–31 May 1970. The Calcutta conference was the founding conference of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, new Communist Party of India (Marxist) trade union.|$|E
25|$|The {{first attempt}} by an {{external}} organization {{to manage the}} world championship was in 1887–89, but this experiment was not repeated. A system for managing regular contests for the title went into operation in 1948, {{under the control of}} FIDE, and functioned quite smoothly until 1993. However, in that year reigning champion Kasparov and challenger Short were so dissatisfied with FIDE's arrangements for their match that they set up a <b>break-away</b> organization. The split in the world championship continued until the reunification match in 2006; however, the compromises required in order to achieve reunification had effects that lasted until the 2010 match. After reunification, FIDE retains the right the organize the world championship match, stabilizing to a two year cycle.|$|E
