25|$|We had {{to create}} our own {{journals}} because {{it was impossible to}} obtain entry into the official journals of psychiatry and medicine. Before 1967 I had not found it difficult to publish reports in these journals, and <b>by</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> had about 150 articles and several books in the establishment press.|$|E
25|$|<b>By</b> <b>then,</b> <b>I.</b> M. Melik had {{invested}} his {{money into a}} large-scale agricultural venture, on the Moldavian estate of Costeștii Botoșanilor. The purchase took place in March 1885. As he himself noted, 507 fálce of land (some 726 hectares) were exchanged for his 210,000 lei, cash. This was {{a third of the}} estate, as defined by tradition, and a half of the actual village.|$|E
2500|$|Dana being whipped: [...] "All I {{was really}} aware of was the pain. I thought Weylin meant to kill me. I thought I would {{die on the}} ground there with a mouth full of dirt and blood and a white man cursing and lecturing as he beat me. <b>By</b> <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> almost wanted to die. Anything to stop the pain. I vomited. And I vomited again because I couldn’t move my face away." [...] (Kindred, p.107) ...|$|E

2500|$|Turner {{was offered}} the chance to join World Series Cricket. He turned it down after he found the matches would be played in {{opposition}} to the Australian Cricket Board matches that were being sponsored by his employer, British American Tobacco. [...] "I felt I couldn't turn my back on a company that had supported me in cricket for nearly ten years, and <b>by</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> wasn't really enjoying playing cricket for a living," [...] said Turner.|$|E
2500|$|Best's sixth goal saw him go one on {{one with}} Northampton goalkeeper Kim Book. Best made a feint to go right which put Book on his backside, before he went left and walked {{the ball into the}} net. Of the goal Book said: [...] "I {{remember}} thinking George was going to go one way, but he dropped his shoulder and went the other, and <b>by</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> was already on the deck. He was just too good for me." [...] Best's six goal performance earned him an invitation to No 10 Downing Street from UK Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who had also regularly written fan letters to him. In 2002 the British public voted Best's record breaking performance #26 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.|$|E
2500|$|In 1961, Brando {{made his}} directorial {{debut in the}} western One-Eyed Jacks. The picture was {{originally}} directed by Stanley Kubrick, but he was fired early in the production. Paramount then made Brando the director. Brando portrays the lead character Rio, and Karl Malden plays his partner [...] "Dad" [...] Longworth. The supporting cast features Katy Jurado, Ben Johnson, and Slim Pickens. Brando's penchant for multiple retakes and character exploration as an actor carried over into his directing, however, and the film soon went over budget; Paramount expected the film to take three months to complete but shooting stretched to six and the cost doubled to more than six million dollars. Brando's inexperience as an editor also delayed postproduction and Paramount eventually {{took control of the}} film. Brando later wrote, [...] "Paramount said it didn't like my version of the story; I'd had everyone lie except Karl Malden. The studio cut the movie to pieces and made him a liar, too. <b>By</b> <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> was bored with the whole project and walked away from it." [...] One-Eyed Jacks was poorly reviewed by critics. While the film did solid business, it ran so over budget that it lost money.|$|E
6000|$|... "Last night," [...] {{said the}} whisperer, hastily, [...] "I {{went for a}} quiet walk round Victoria Park all <b>by</b> myself. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> met Mr. Stokes, and we had one half-pint {{together}} at a public-house. That's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do not fear, Madame, it {{will soon}} be over,' said Darpent. 'It is a little {{amusement}} in which they daily indulge. The torrent will soon pass <b>by,</b> and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> will do myself the honour of escorting you home.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never, sir," [...] the man declared. [...] "I've a way {{of getting}} a drop too much when I'm <b>by</b> myself. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> tumbles off to sleep and that's the end of it. I've no fancy for company at such times." ...|$|R
2500|$|When Rob Liefeld, one of Image's co-founders, {{split from}} the {{publisher}} and formed his own company Awesome Entertainment, he hired Moore {{to create a new}} universe for the characters he had brought with him from Image. Moore's [...] "solution was breathtaking and cocky – he created a long and distinguished history for these new characters, retro-fitting a fake silver and gold age for them." [...] Moore began writing comics for many of these characters, such as Glory and Youngblood, as well as a three-part mini-series known as Judgment Day to provide a basis for the Awesome Universe. Moore was not satisfied with Liefeld, saying [...] "I just got fed up with the unreliability of information that I get from him, that I didn't trust him. I didn't think that he was respecting the work and I found it hard to respect him. And also <b>by</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> was probably feeling that with the exception of Jim Lee, Jim Valentino – people like that – that a couple of the Image partners were seeming, to my eyes, to be less than gentlemen. They were seeming to be not necessarily the people I wanted to deal with." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harras also commented, [...] "As soon as I saw {{the sketch}} by Walter [...] and heard Louise's take on him, I {{knew we had}} the {{character}} I wanted. Jackson [...] redrew the page, patching in the shadowy Apocalypse where the Owl had been. But the genesis was clearly Walt and Weezie's." [...] Guice admitted to difficulty recalling the details behind redrawing the last page of issue #5: [...] "The best I can remember now is putting his look together pretty much right on the pencil page—just adding bits of costuming business which hinted toward his true appearance when we'd eventually see him in full reveal. I don't believe {{there was even a}} character sketch done for him at that point—I planned on making sense of it all later on, but <b>by</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> was gone and others had that concern." [...] Apocalypse's silhouette in issue #5 does not match up with his full appearance in issue #6, suggesting the possibility that Guice was using Simonson's sketch as a reference for issue #6 but did not have access to it earlier, necessitating that he come up with his own design for issue #5. Walter Simonson himself has downplayed his role in the character's creation, saying that Guice was responsible for creating the design and that he, Simonson, merely modified it later: [...] "I did not co-create Apocalypse. However, I wish I had. Louise Simonson and Jackson Guice created him. He appeared in a few panels {{at the end of one}} of Jackson’s last X-FACTORs, so I am the first artist to use him extensively in stories. And I kind of juiced up his physique a bit." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Had it {{not been}} for the Tartars I would not be alive today. They were the nomads of the Crimea, in what was then no man's land between the Russian and German fronts, and favoured neither side. I had already struck up a good {{relationship}} with them, and often wandered off to sit with them. ‘Du nix njemcky’ they would say, ‘du Tartar,’ and try to persuade me to join their clan. Their nomadic ways attracted me of course, although by that time their movements had been restricted. Yet, it was they who discovered me in the snow after the crash, when the German search parties had given up. I was still unconscious then and only came round completely after twelve days or so, and <b>by</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> was back in a German field hospital. So the memories I have of that time are images that penetrated my consciousness. The last thing I remember was that it was too late to jump, too late for the parachutes to open. That must have been a couple of seconds before hitting the ground. Luckily I was not strapped in – I always preferred free movement to safety belts… My friend was strapped in and he was atomized on impact – there was almost nothing to be found of him afterwards. But I must have shot through the windscreen as it flew back at the same speed as the plane hit the ground and that saved me, though I had bad skull and jaw injuries. Then the tail flipped over and I was completely buried in the snow. That's how the Tartars found me days later. I remember voices saying ‘Voda’ (Water), then the felt of their tents, and the dense pungent smell of cheese, fat and milk. They covered my body in fat to help it regenerate warmth, and wrapped it in felt as an insulator to keep warmth in." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{passed the}} bridge, {{and soon after}} that I asked if she saw the lock. She said no, {{she did not see}} any lock; and I said, “Oh!” and pulled on. Another five minutes went <b>by,</b> and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> asked her to look again.|$|R
60|$|Fully half-an-hour went <b>by,</b> and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> saw Johnson and Louis in {{some sort}} of altercation. It ended with Johnson flinging off Louis’s detaining arm and {{starting}} forward. He crossed the deck, sprang into the fore rigging, and began to climb. But the quick eye of Wolf Larsen caught him.|$|R
60|$|With that I made my mind up, {{took out}} my gully, opened {{it with my}} teeth, and cut one strand after another, till the vessel only swung <b>by</b> two. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> lay quiet, waiting to sever these last when the strain should be once more {{lightened}} by a breath of wind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Much obliged," [...] said Kiddy Leech, {{pocketing}} {{the silver}} with satisfaction. [...] "But if you don't mind, I won't start out until about noon time. <b>By</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> reckon my back will I feel better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Probably because I didn't {{care whether}} I escaped or not," [...] Felix replied, with a short, bitter laugh. [...] "I stood behind some shrubs {{just inside the}} garden, and watched the hunt go <b>by.</b> <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> came out here and sat down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{sacrifice}} {{which you}} ask of me I will make: I {{will take the}} risk {{for the sake of}} my country and of my faith. To-morrow at noon I will come to your lodgings and tell you in detail all the arrangements which I shall have made <b>by</b> <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> have no fear for Gilda.

6000|$|... "Very well, Frederic; <b>then</b> <b>I</b> {{will wait}}. I will wait till Sunday. I {{do not wish}} to take any step of which you do not approve. If you have not heard <b>by</b> Sunday morning, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> will write to her--on Monday." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Then {{away to the}} work, and afterwards--to-morrow or next day--come {{back and}} make report. Just now I am much moved to solitary prayer, so {{wait till you see}} me here alone upon my knees. Stay!

6000|$|... "And vanish together, as you see," [...] she retorted. [...] "Well, {{if you are}} {{not going}} to bother about the burglar, I shouldn't bother about the lunch. It's Sunday, and we can't send for vinegar and all that in the town; and you Indian gentlemen can't enjoy what you call a dinner without a lot of hot things. I wish to {{goodness}} now you hadn't asked Cousin Oliver to take me to the musical service.

6000|$|... "I don't {{think those}} folks ashore got a {{sight of the}} yacht or boat," [...] he said. [...] "It will be morning before they find out where we've gone, {{and we should be}} a good many miles to the north <b>by</b> <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> don't suppose they know Ormsgill isn't with us either, and that will {{probably}} put them off his trail for a time, at least. In the meanwhile you'll head her out a point or two more to the westwards for another hour, and have me called at daylight. I'm going down to change my clothes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} have sent round to me {{and let me know}} what you were doing," [...] said Flower. [...] "I sat in that blamed pub till they turned me out at twelve, expecting you every minute. I’d only threepence left <b>by</b> <b>then,</b> and <b>I</b> crossed the water with that, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> had to shuffle along to Greenwich as best I could with a bad foot.

6000|$|... "I will {{presently}} {{decide what}} is to happen to Ruggedo," [...] said he in a hard, stern voice. Then, turning to the throng of Kings and Queens, he continued: [...] "Tik-Tok has spoken truly, for his machinery will not allow him to lie, nor will it allow his thoughts to think falsely. Therefore {{these people are not}} our enemies and must be treated with consideration and justice. Take them to your palaces and entertain them as guests until to-morrow, when I command that they be brought again to my Residence. <b>By</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> shall have formed my plans." ...|$|E
60|$|With {{some little}} {{circumstance}} my traveller picked {{his way to}} me, and with a grave civility bowed me a sort of general welcome. Whereupon ensued such wit and banter as made me thankful when the opening impudence {{of a kind of}} jig set the heels and the petticoats of the company tossing once more. We danced the lightning out, and piped the thunder from the skies. And <b>by</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> was so faint with fasting, and so deep in love with at least five young country faces, that I scarcely knew head from heels; still less, when a long draught of a kind of thin, sweet ale had mounted to its sphere.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{feel quite}} {{satisfied}} {{you will not}} jilt me, and as I shall insist on having the ceremony performed, I choose to regard it as a certainty. Passing that <b>by,</b> <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> {{will go on to}} the results. My uncles, and aunts, and cousins, and the people you talk of, were very reasonable folk when I last saw them, and quite sufficiently alive {{to the fact that they}} had to regard me as the head of their family. I do not doubt that we shall find them equally reasonable when we get home; but should they be changed, should there be any sign shewn that my choice of a wife had occasioned displeasure,--such displeasure would not affect you." ...|$|E
