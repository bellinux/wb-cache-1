5000|$|The hamstrings {{undergo a}} complex dynamic process during gait, making it unsurprising {{that they are}} {{frequently}} injured. They must first contract concentrically during {{the end of the}} stance phase in order to bend the knee and allow the foot (along with dorsiflexion at the ankle) to clear the ground. At the end of the swing phase the hamstrings must eccentrically contract while applying a <b>braking</b> <b>moment</b> to knee extension, then immediately change functions to again concentrically contract and produce hip extension. Studies have shown that “the hamstring group reaches peak elongation and acts eccentrically at the hip and knee during the late swing phases of running” and that “the hamstrings are most active and develop the greatest torques at the hip and knee during the late swing through midstance phase of running.” [...] Thus, the hamstrings reach their maximum length while attempting to forcefully contract eccentrically and switch functions to immediately produce a concentric contraction, which makes the terminal part of swing phase the most vulnerable for injury.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{wind turbine}} design and {{manufacturing}} companies experiment with alternative yaw breaking methods {{in order to}} eliminate the drawbacks of the existing systems and {{to reduce the cost}} of the system. One of these alternatives involves the use of air pressure in order to achieve the necessary yaw <b>braking</b> <b>moment.</b> In this case, some of the gliding surface (usually the axial, due to higher available surface) is utilized in order to accommodate the yaw brake pads and the pneumatic brake mechanism. The pneumatic actuator can be a conventional pneumatic cylinder or even a flexible air chamber which inflates when supplied with pressurized air. Such a device is able to exert very high braking forces due to the high active surface. This is achieved with a simple industrial air pressure compression system (...) which is a reliable and low cost solution. Furthermore, in the even of leakage, the environmental impact is practically zero compared to hydraulic oil leakages. Finally brake actuators can be produced with very low cost from lightweight plastic materials thus significantly reducing the overall cost of the system.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper offers}} {{to use a}} curve of {{changing}} vibration amplitude of the rotating moment on the worm shaft of reducer {{in the process of}} growing <b>brake</b> (loading) <b>moment</b> as one of criteria of the worm reducer operability. A condition of reducer operability at the nominal moment is lack of vibrations of the rotating moment with a critical value of amplitude. It is shown that vibrations of rotating moment on a shaft of the electric engine, by their nature, are self-vibrations in the system with "negative friction". Values of the <b>brake</b> <b>moment</b> at which there is a sharp increase of vibration amplitude leading to operability loss correspond to the nominal moment for this reducer or to the <b>brake</b> <b>moment,</b> corresponding to the maximum efficiency. It is shown that different lubricants differently influence on the generation of self-vibrations. The most efficient damping occurs when using oil with the additive "Striboil", and the reason of falling efficiency at the excess of the nominal moment is essentially increased energy losses at generation of vibrations with "negative friction", especially when approaching to the resonance area. Thus, taking into account a nature of damping vibrations, with using different lubricants, allows us to increase the permissible tension since the more is a damping value the more is a <b>brake</b> <b>moment</b> corresponding to the maximum efficiency. It is noted that, when using the additives to oils, a growth of the permissible tension is caused by the processes of film formation increasing the real contact area, which increases its share of the nominal contact area determined by the Hertz formula. </p...|$|R

40|$|The braking {{behavior}} of industrial robots {{is an important}} aspect for the hazard assessment of human-robot interaction involving high robot speeds. This paper proposes an adaptation of a complementarity-based treatment of friction forces [1] to the simulation of the stopping {{behavior of}} robots. A time-stepping scheme is used for integration. The system matrices are computed using an auto-coding scheme to allow rapid adaptation to arbitrary serial kinematic robots. The model is capable of handling the set-valuedness of the friction curve. Comparison of the model results with the measured braking behavior of an industrial robot shows that the general behavior of the model is correct. However, the agreement of model and measurement is still not satisfying. Better mass parameter values and functions for the <b>brake</b> <b>moment</b> are required. Simulations performed with the model suggest a strong and possibly hazardous decay of the stopping behavior for specific robot motions {{that is hard to}} predict without an appropriate model...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{developers}} of multi-wheeled vehicles (MWV) show {{growing interest in}} electromechanical drive in the «motor-axis» implementation. However, in designing the traction electric drive (TED) based on such approach the problems arise, primarily, {{from a lack of}} creating experience and of ready algorithmic solutions to control the traction motors. The use of methods to implement the individual TED is impossible {{because of the presence of}} cross-axle differential in the leading axle drive, which does not allow the input torque control of each wheel singly. The paper offers a law to control a traction electric drive of MWV leading axles that comprises the law to control the tractive effort torque and <b>braking</b> <b>moment</b> on the leading axles as well as algorithms of anti-lock brake and traction control systems. An analysis of simulation modeling results shows an efficiency of the developed law that allows control of the traction electric drive of MWV leading axles. The control law includes an algorithm to control the tractive effort torque and <b>braking</b> <b>moment</b> on the driving-wheels, as well as algorithms of anti-lock brake and traction systems. At stationary (constant speed rotation) and non-stationary (elk test) maneuvering there was no spin of vehicle wheels. Angular speeds of the wheels vary smoothly. Partial loss of vehicle stability when making maneuvers on ice may be reduced through development of algorithms for dynamic stabilization, which will improve the MWV road-holding and trajectory ability. Fullscale tests of MWV with traction electric drive implemented using a “motor-axis" approach are required to have a final answer on the performance and effectiveness of the developed control law. </p...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} control design method for a driver {{assistance}} system. In {{the operation of}} the system, a predefined trajectory required by the driver with a steering command is followed. During manoeuvres the control system generates differential <b>brake</b> <b>moment</b> and the auxiliary front-wheel steering angle and changes the camber angles of the wheels in order to improve the tracking of the road trajectory. The performance specifications are guaranteed by the local controllers, i. e. the brake, the steering, and the suspension systems, while the coordination of these components is provided by the supervisor. The advantage of this architecture is that local controllers are designed independently, which is ensured {{by the fact that the}} monitoring signals are taken into consideration in the formalisation of their performance specifications. The fault-tolerant control can be achieved by incorporating the detected fault signals in their performance specifications. The control system also uses a driver model, with which the reference signal can be generated. In the control design, the parameter-dependent linear parameter-varyingmethod, which meets the performance specifications, is used. The operation of the control system is illustrated through different normal and emergency vehicle manoeuvres with a high-accuracy simulation software. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Grou...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of a vehicle {{anti-lock}} braking system (ABS) is to prevent the tyres from locking-up in order to brake efficiently whilst maintaining steering control and stability. Sport utility vehicles (SUV) are designed to drive on various roads under different driving conditions, making it challenging to identify optimal operating conditions for ABS algorithms to be implemented. This paper describes the development and modelling of a testing trailer {{that is designed to}} benefit the research of a SUV tyre operating in ABS braking modes on non-deformable rough terrain. The test trailer can be to investigate the variation of tyre contact forces and vibration characteristics influenced by ABS braking and rough terrain excitation. Undesirable fluctuations of wheel speed, normal force and <b>braking</b> <b>moments</b> make measurements more complicated and limits the performance of active safety systems. A trailer made from a Land Rover Defender chassis is used with standard ABS components and is implemented with a Bosch ABS algorithm for experimental tests. In addition to the ABS system the necessary measuring equipment such as Wheel Force Transducers (WFT), accelerometers, brake pressure transducers, GPS and vehicle speed measurement instrumentation is used. An Adams model of the trailer in co-simulation with ABS and test control in MATLAB/Simulink is created to validate the model. The centre of gravity position and inertia characteristics of the trailer are determined through experimental testing. A validated FTire tyre model, suitable for off-road conditions, is incorporated to accurately resemble the specific tyre used during tests. The validated Adams model and test trailer will enable further development of ABS algorithms including the identification of key parameters through which ABS braking can be optimised for various roads as well as optimizing interaction with semi-active suspension systems...|$|R

40|$|Basically, {{there are}} two main {{techniques}} to control the vehicle yaw moment. First method is the indirect yaw moment control, which works on the basis of active steering control (ASC). The second one being the direct yaw moment control (DYC), which is based on either the differential braking or the torque vectoring. An innovative idea for the direct yaw moment control is introduced by using an active controller system to supervise the lat-eral dynamics of vehicle and perform as an active yaw moment control system, denoted as the stabilizer pendulum system (SPS). This idea has further been developed, analyzed, and implemented in a standalone direct yaw moment control system, as well as, in an inte-grated vehicle dynamic control system with a differential <b>braking</b> yaw <b>moment</b> controller. The effectiveness of SPS has been evaluated by model simulation, which illustrates its superior performance especially on low friction roads. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4027499]...|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to thank the staff at the Radlabor Freiburg (Radlabor GmbH, Freiburg, Germany) for the use of the {{laboratory}} facilities and for providing assistance with the measurement devices. In cycling, force applied to the pedal is conventionally measured using strain gauges or piezoelectric force transducers within the pedal body or at the crank. This thesis takes a different approach to determine pedal force based on motion capturing. Pedal force is calculated as the sum of forces needed to overcome the resistance of the ergometer <b>brake</b> and the <b>moment</b> of inertia of the ergometer’s flywheel. The former is obtained from cadence and power measurements of the ergometer, the latter by means of flywheel inertia and angular acceleration of the crank. The crank angle was determined by tracking the pedal movement using motion capturing. Then the second derivative of the crank angle gave its angular acceleration. As noise inherent in measurement data causes serious problems when computing derivatives, the data was smoothed beforehand. Three smoothing techniques were applied: a Butterworth filter, a Kalman smoother, and singular spectrum analysis. The angular acceleration obtained by the three methods was similar. The analysis of the pedal motion data revealed that systematic errors and strong measurement noise prevent sufficiently accurate estimates of the angular acceleration of the crank. Therefore, the resulting pedal force estimates differ considerably from the force obtained by a pedal force measurement device (Powertec System). ii Kurzfassun...|$|R
40|$|The 4 "t"h meeting aims to {{exchange}} {{the experience and}} knowledge of engineers during several presentations and discussions about new developments required for a reliable, time and cost reducing validation of the wheel/hub assembly. Tremendous development of the wheel performance, described by {{the ratio of the}} rated load (kg) versus the wheel weight (kg) had taken place during the last 5000 years. Starting from the ratio of 3 for wooden 2 -piece-disc-wheels in Mesopotamia it needed nearly 1000 years to increase the ratio to approx 5 at light-weight spoke wheels for fighting carriages, found in the grave of king Tutenchamon in Egypt. Modern light alloy wheels of commercial vehicles reach values up to 160 kg/kg. Additionally the comlex design of the modern systems for cars and commercial vehicles comprising wheel, brake, hub, bearing, spindle and hub carrier, including different materials and their treatment, fasteners, press-fits, require an appropriate testing procedure. The variable loading conditions, caused by operational wheel forces, <b>brake</b> and torque <b>moments</b> including heating, may result in changing tolerances and press-fits during operation and consequently in different damage mechanisms. This can be simulated in the Biaxial Wheel Test Machine, whereby corresponding load programs are necessary. An overview about all biaxial test machines in usage at the end of 1999 is shown in the introduction. The total number is 17 for cars, 7 for commercial vehicles and 1 for trains. The six presentations of this meeting were consequently concentrated on: (a) recommendations for a standardization of load programs of the German Wheel Committee, (b) the simulation of brake and torque events and (c) the possibility for a numerical stress analyses and fatigue life assessment.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis describes an investigation into vehicle handling control using active differentials in the rear axle of a motor vehicle. Such devices are able to transfer torque between the rear wheels and have traditionally been used to improve traction whilst minimising the impact on vehicle handling. However, the capacity to generate a lateral torque difference across an axle also gives them {{the potential to be}} used for yaw moment control. In order to generate a rigorous assessment of this potential, the investigation is carried out in three distinct phases. Firstly, an analysis of the scope for modifying vehicle handling given unrestricted control over torque transfer between the rear wheels is carded out in the simulation environment. For this purpose an idealised yaw sideslip controller is developed. This is used to show that an ideal active differential can have significant yaw moment authority in terms of generating both understeer and oversteer and that this can be used to actively modify a vehicle's handling balance and apply stability control at the limits of adhesion. In the second phase, the capabilities of two types of contemporary active differential, the torque vectoring differential (TVD) and active limited slip differential (ALSID), are then assessed against the ideal differential and against a <b>brake</b> based yaw <b>moment</b> controller. TVDs are found to be able to offer very similar performance to both their ideal counterpart and to the brake based system. They Gan also deliver this performance with a fraction of the energy loss that is observed in the brakes, thus making TVDs a viable proposition for applying continuous yaw control below the limits of adhesion. ALSDs, on the other hand do not offer equivalent functionality to an ideal active differential but are still shown to be very effective stability control devices. In the third phase, the ALSID results are validated on a prototype vehicle where it is shown that they do indeed offer substantial stability improvements both on high and low-P surfaces. However in order to deliver such benefits and be practical for implementation, it is also shown that significant redevelopment of the idealised controller is required.
