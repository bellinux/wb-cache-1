5|$|In 1840, {{about six}} camels were shipped from Tenerife to Adelaide, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> survived {{the journey to}} arrive on 12 October that year. The animal, a male called Harry, was owned by the {{explorer}} John Ainsworth Horrocks. Harry was ill-tempered but was included in an expedition the following year because he could carry heavy loads. The next major group of camels were imported into Australia in 1860, and between 1860 and 1907 10 to 12 thousand were imported. These were used mainly for riding and transport.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{production}} {{in the twentieth century}} relied on treatment with hot, concentrated sulfuric acid in cast iron vessels, followed by selective precipitation by dilution with water, as on the subsequent steps. This method relied on the specifics of the technique and the concentrate grain size; many alternatives have been proposed, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> has proven effective economically: alkaline digestion with hot sodium hydroxide solution. This is more expensive than the original method but yields a higher purity of thorium; in particular, it removes phosphates from the concentrate.|$|E
