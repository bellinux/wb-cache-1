In this paper, some key improvements of EFPI-based pressure sensors {{such as the}} controlled thermal bonding technique, diaphragm-based EFPI sensors, and white light interference technology have been reviewed. Recent progress on signal demodulation method and applications of EFPI-based pressure sensors has been introduced. Signal demodulation algorithms based on the cross correlation and mean square error (MSE) estimation have been proposed for retrieving the cavity length of EFPI. Absolute measurement with a resolution of 0.08 nm over large dynamic range has been carried out. For downhole monitoring, an EFPI and a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) cascade multiplexing fiber-optic sensor system has been developed, which can operate in temperature 300 °C with a good long-term stability and extremely low temperature cross-sensitivity. Diaphragm-based EFPI pressure sensors have been successfully used for low pressure and acoustic wave detection. Experimental results show that a sensitivity of 31 mV/Pa in the frequency range of 100 Hz to 12.7 kHz for aeroacoustic wave detection has been obtained.|$|R

40|$|In this {{presentation}} to the NASA Aeronautics Sensor Working Group {{the application of a}} strain sensor is outlined. The high-temperature <b>extrinsic</b> <b>Fabry-Perot</b> <b>interferometer</b> (EFPI) strain sensor was developed due to a need for robust strain sensors that operate accurately and reliably beyond 1800 F. Specifically, the new strain sensor would provide data for validating finite element models and thermal-structural analyses. Sensor attachment techniques were also developed to improve methods of handling and protecting the fragile sensors during the harsh installation process. It was determined that thermal sprayed attachments are preferable even though cements are simpler to apply as cements are more prone to bond failure and are often corrosive. Previous thermal/mechanical cantilever beam testing of EFPI yielded very little change to 1200 F, with excellent correlation with SG to 550 F. Current combined thermal/mechanical loading for sensitivity testing is accomplished by a furnace/cantilever beam loading system. Dilatometer testing has can also be used in sensor characterization to evaluate bond integrity, evaluate sensitivity and accuracy and to evaluate sensor-to-sensor scatter, repeatability, hysteresis and drift.

Using a wavelength modulated source and a novel extendedgap EFPI, some of the limitations of interferometric signal demodulation are overcome. By scanning the output wavelength of a multilongitudinal mode laser diode through current modulation, the EFPI sensor signal is scanned through multiple fringes. Gap movement is then unambiguously determined by monitoring the phase of the multiple fringe pattern.

The main organs of the vestibular system are the semicircular canals, the saccule, and the utricle.

Hair cells found in different parts of the inner ear are structurally different and are mechanically specialized to perform different functions. In this study, the linear and torsional stiffnesses were measured for hair cells located in the red ear slider turtle utricle. The system used to measure the stiffnesses was composed of a glass whisker (attached to a pipette) used to produce a force on the tip of the bundle, an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>Fabry-Perot</b> <b>interferometer</b> (EFPI) to measure the displacement of the pipette, and a photoelectronic motion transducer (PMT) to measure the displacement of the bundle.

A classical function generator is operated for controlling the vibrator. By fixing an excitation frequency of 100 Hz and varying the excitation amplitude range of 0. 1 – 3 Volts, the output displacements measured by the fiber sensor are obtained from 1. 55 µm to 30. 225 µm.

40|$|Under this grant, {{fiber optic}} sensors were {{investigated}} {{for use in}} the nondestructive evaluation of aging aircraft. Specifically, optical fiber sensors for detection and location of impacts on a surface, and for detection of corrosion in metals were developed. The use of neural networks was investigated for determining impact location by processing the output of a network of fiberoptic strain sensors distributed on a surface. This approach employs triangulation to determine location by comparing the arrival times at several sensors, of the acoustic signal generated by the impact. For this study, a neural network simulator running on a personal computer was used to train a network using a back-propagation algorithm. Fiber optic <b>extrinsic</b> <b>Fabry-Perot</b> <b>interferometer</b> (EFPI) strain sensors are attached to or embedded in the surface, so that stress waves emanating from an impact can be detected. The ability of the network to determine impact location by time-or-arrival of acoustic signals was assessed by comparing network outputs with actual experimental results using impacts on a panel instrumented with optical fiber sensors. Using the neural network to process the sensor outputs, the impact location can be inferred to centimeter range accuracy directly from the arrival time data. In addition, the network can be trained to determine impact location, regardless of material anisotropy. Results demonstrate that a back-propagation network identifies impact location for an anisotropic graphite/bismaleimide plate with the same accuracy as that for an isotropic aluminum plate. Two different approaches were investigated for the development of fiber optic sensors for corrosion detection in metals, both utilizing optical fiber sensors with metal coatings. In the first approach, an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>Fabry-Perot</b> interferometric fiber optic strain sensor was placed under tensile stress, and while in the resulting strained position, a thick coating of metal was applied. Due to an increase in the quantity of material, the sensor does not return to its original position upon removal of the applied stress, and some residual strain is maintained within the sensor element. As the metal thickness decreases due to corrosion, this strain is released, providing the sensing mechanism for corrosion detection. In the second approach, photosensitive optical fibers with long period Bragg gratings in the core were coated with metal. The Bragg gratings serve to couple core modes at discrete wavelengths to cladding modes. Since cladding modes interact with the metal coating surrounding the fiber cladding, the specific wavelengths coupled from core to cladding depend on the refractive index of the metal coating. Therefore, as the metal corrodes, the resulting change in index of the coating may be measured by measuring the change in wavelength of the coupled mode. Results demonstrate that both approaches can be successfully used to track the loss in metal coating on the optical fiber sensors due to corrosion...|$|R
