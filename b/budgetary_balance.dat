40|$|Both {{formal rules}} and {{informal}} norms guide government operations; formal rules often function through informal norms. Balanced budget requirements (BBRs) are formal rules, {{but they are}} implemented via the intermediary of informal norms—interpretation of BBRs by state officials. This article examines the fiscal implications of informal norms that govern <b>budgetary</b> <b>balance.</b> We propose that informal norms have substantive implications in policy making and implementation. To test the proposition, we obtain state self-reported, time-varying data on balanced budget provisions as observations of informal norms, compare them against formal, codified balanced budget requirements from recent research to identify gaps between rules and norms, and decompose the gaps using two categories—‘‘interpretations’ ’ and ‘‘reverse interpretations’ ’ of formal balanced budget requirements. We then conduct probit estimation to obtain the effects of informal norms {{as well as the}} interpretations and reverse interpretations on two measures of <b>budgetary</b> <b>balance.</b> Results show that informal norms do affect outcomes of government financial operations; the two-step decomposition of the gaps between formal rules and informal norms provides further information on the locus of these effects.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the revenue-expenditure nexus in the case of the 15 members of the European Union. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses a VECM framework to determine the causal ordering between these two macroeconomic aggregates. Findings - The empirical tests have yielded mixed results. The fiscal synchronisation hypothesis is supported for Denmark, Greece, Ireland, The Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden while, in the case of Austria, Belgium and Germany, the results point to the institutional separation hypothesis. Unidirectional causality from revenue to expenditure appears to be the case for Italy and Spain while the reverse causal ordering is found for Luxembourg. The findings also suggest the presence of the Buchanan-Wagner hypothesis for Finland, France and the UK. Originality/value - The determination of the causal ordering between these two macroeconomic aggregates has important implications for fiscal policy and the concomitant determination of <b>budgetary</b> <b>balances.</b> This is particularly true for the countries that participate in the eurozone and thus fall under the provisions of the stability and growth pact. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R

Nevertheless, central government has not given it sufficient authority over the introduction of new local taxes and the issuance of {{local government}} bonds. Given a decline in local revenue caused by sluggish economic growth and an increased tendency for local government to implement an expansionary fiscal policy on behalf of the central government, this system has given rise to a growing gap between expenditure and autonomous local revenue. This in turn has caused a rapid increase in various inter-governmental transfers from economically stronger regions to weaker ones, leading to a perplexed situation where the local governments of the former have invested little in fixed capital formation relative to the population and economic size, and have faced severe <b>budgetary</b> <b>balances,</b> as compared to the latter group. Moreover, inter-governmental transfers have not contributed significantly to promoting local private sector activities and narrowing income differentials. This suggests that developing countries in search for a better governance system for local governments need to carefully design the inter-government transfer system. So far, the Russian system appears to be superior to China’s since it is more rule-based and simpler. However...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the redistributive {{effects of the}} EU budget during the period 1986 - 98, explores {{the implications of the}} Berlin budget agreement and advances a proposal for setting member countries' <b>budgetary</b> <b>balances</b> {{in a manner consistent with}} a simple equity criterion based on relative income per capita. Using an extension of a standard methodology, we find that the redistributive impact of the EU budget has been considerable in view of its small size, that it has tended to increase over time, and that it is mostly due to the effects of structural programmes. We also find that, in spite of the relative loss of weight of structural transfers, the expenditure side of the Berlin budget agreement represents a noticeable (but small) improvement over the previous financial perspectives in terms of both its redistributive impact and its horizontal equity properties. Our proposed allocation criterion involves the correction of horizontal inequities while preserving the current degree of redistribution. This would involve a sizable reallocation of net contributions across rich countries and only a modest reduction in north-south fiscal flows.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to outline a {{reformed}} budget for the European Union. The focus was on the fight between net contributors and net recipients {{with regards to the}} theory of fiscal federalism and the current levels of integration by the EU. The advent of the crisis was the motivation for the authorities to learn from the crisis and then to implement reforms. An analysis of the theory of public finance, the theory of fiscal federalism and {{the current state of the}} EU budget reveals three main areas that need to be resolved by this reform. The lack of a stabilisation function, inefficient allocation of expenditure chapters and, mainly the inequity in the distribution of funds between Member States indicated the need for radical change. Optimising operational <b>budgetary</b> <b>balances</b> with a mathematical model that would calculate these balances ex ante was not technically feasible. Thus, the author presents a model that could despite its simplifications bring significant benefits to the problems of "Juste Retour" by contributing towards fairer allocation and a reduction conflict between groups of beneficiaries and contributors. Additionally, significant outcomes were achieved with regards to the EU Budget notably greater flexibility and an overall simplification of the budget. Symptomatically a partial automatic stabiliser will be created for special cases such as asymmetric shock. The reform could serve to address the problem of "Juste Retour". Its weaknesses can be removed by further research...|$|R
