Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher kicked the <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Bayern half, defender Thiam missed his header, which meant the ball dropped to Owen, who {{controlled}} the ball with his right foot and then put the <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Bayern goal with his left foot. Bayern reduced the deficit in the 57th minute when Salihamidžić scored. He headed the <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Liverpool goal from Bayern's first corner of the match {{to reduce the deficit}} to two goals. Midway through the half both teams made substitutions. Bayern replaced Sforza, Claudio Pizarro and Salihamidžić for Niko Kovač, Carsten Jancker and Roque Santa Cruz respectively. Liverpool substituted Gerrard and Riise for Igor Bišćan and Danny Murphy respectively. Liverpool started to pass the ball around their midfield and defence in an attempt to waste time, however in the 82nd minute Bayern scored again. Substitute Jancker headed into the Liverpool goal from a cross by Elber. Immediately afterwards Bayern had an opportunity to equalise, however Lizarazu's shot was straight at Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld. No further goals were scored and the referee blew for full-time with the final score 3–2 to Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Minutes later Alavés {{made the}} first {{substitution}} of the match when Iván Alonso replaced defender Dan Eggen. The change had the desired effect as four minutes later, Alavés scored. Right wing-back Cosmin Contra put the <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> area form {{the right side of}} the pitch and Alonso rose above Babbel to head the <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> net to make the scoreline 2–1. Immediately afterwards, Alavés were almost level when Contra put another <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> penalty area, however, Henchoz cleared the ball before an Alavés player could reach it. In the 35th minute, Alavés were again nearly level. Alonso's header fell to Javi Moreno, who went past Henchoz his shot was saved by Westerveld after it his chest. The rebound fell to Ivan Tomić, but Westerveld again saved his shot. Five minutes later, Liverpool were awarded a penalty. Michael Owen had run into the penalty area past the Alavés defence, he was brought down by Herrera was who was booked for the foul. Gary McAllister took the penalty and scored to put Liverpool 3–1 ahead.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{outcome was}} in doubt {{until the final}} minute of play. With 19seconds left on the game clock, Vince Young ran for a {{touchdown}} and regained the lead for the Longhorns. He followed up by running the <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> end zone for a two-point conversion. Leinart had time to attempt one pass but his pass fell out of bounds as time expired; UT beat USC by the score of 41–38.|$|E
5|$|A minute later, West Ham {{went ahead}} again; defender Paul Konchesky {{received}} {{the ball on}} the left flank, and played a <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Liverpool penalty area, only to see it sail over goalkeeper Reina and into the goal.

5|$|After the kickoff, Florida State went three-and-out and punted back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies {{began their}} second {{possession}} of the quarter at their 39-yard line and started the drive with five consecutive running plays, advancing 28 yards in the process. Tech then switched to its passing offense, throwing four consecutive passes. Three were complete, and the final one, a 21-yard toss from Taylor to Wilson, ended with the running back carrying the <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> end zone.

5|$|Arsenal {{continued}} to dominate possession once {{the second half}} got underway, but struggled {{to use it to}} their advantage. Lauren's cross from the right was cleared away by the United defence and Henry moments later miscued his effort aimed at goal. Moments later Ljungberg beat his marker and crossed the <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> penalty area, only for Bergkamp to drag his shot wide. United threatened once the game reached the hour mark, winning duels and earning set-pieces. Gabriel Heinze's shot from about 20 yards tested Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann in the 65th minute. Five minutes later Wenger substituted Reyes off in place of Pirès.|$|E

5|$|Both {{games against}} Barcelona ended in draws. Despite Giggs, Scholes and Beckham putting the team into a 3–2 lead at Old Trafford, the {{visitors}} were awarded a late penalty after Butt was sent off for handling the ball. Luis Enrique converted the <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> net to leave both teams with {{a point on}} Matchday One. In the return game on 25 November at the Camp Nou, a fixture that Barça needed to win to avoid elimination, Dwight Yorke's goals put United ahead 3–2, but Barça star Rivaldo equalized and nearly scored again but his effort hit the crossbar.|$|E

In the first knockout game against Belgium he made another assist after chipping a free-kick into the penalty area, where David Platt volleyed the <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> net. Gascoigne was at the centre of the action again in the quarter-final clash with Cameroon when he gave away a penalty, which Cameroon converted. In extra-time he made a successful through-ball pass from which Gary Lineker won, and subsequently scored a penalty, which proved to be the winning goal.|$|E
5|$|However, Liverpool did {{score from}} their next attack. Gerrard played a <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> West Ham penalty area, which {{went over the}} head of defender Scaloni and was met by striker Djibril Cissé, who scored to make it 2–1. Ashton came close to {{extending}} West Ham's lead in the 37th minute, but his effort went wide of the post after beating goalkeeper Reina. The last chance of the half came in the 44th minute when Liverpool defender Steve Finnan sliced a clearance straight to striker Harewood, however his shot went out for a throw-in.|$|E

Soon after, Edrich edged to Johnson low down in the cordon and England were 2/52. Edrich decided to stand his ground after the catch was taken, thinking he may have hit a bump <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground, but the umpire thought otherwise and ruled him out. Johnson had little else to do as the pacemen made steady progress on a seaming pitch. He bowled only two overs for three runs as England fell for 186, handing Australia victory by 409 runs and a 20 series lead.|$|E

50|$|Danger Dunk - In {{the first}} round, one player must {{transport}} ten dice across {{the base of}} Skeleton Falls in under ten minutes using a net, while their opponent on a seat four metres high throws <b>balls</b> <b>into</b> another net on their back. If a ball lands in that net, they get a ten-second time penalty. Once the round is over the player swap roles. The player that does this faster wins. In the second round, one player from each team is hanging from a swing holding a large basket, while two other players have to throw <b>balls</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> basket. Every time a new batch of balls come from the waterfall, {{the players on the}} swings are raised higher. The team that gets <b>the</b> most <b>balls</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> basket wins.|$|R
5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and clear weather greeted {{the players on}} the second day. After only four overs had been bowled in total the previous afternoon, Edrich was relieved of the new ball, which was given to Barnett, who accompanied Bedser. Both bowlers swung the <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> right-handed Barnes and away from the left-handed Morris. Not a frontline bowler, Barnett focused on bowling defensively at medium pace, and the Australians wanted to make a safe start, so they decided to play him watchfully. This prompted some commentators to claim Barnett had allowed the Australians to settle into their rhythm by not trying to pressure them.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} round, Arsenal {{travelled}} to The Hawthorns to play West Bromwich Albion. Wenger added {{experience to the}} side to complement youth, with Parlour, Edu, Kanu and Keown all featuring. Arsenal {{took the lead in}} the 25th minute through Kanu. Lauren's cross from the right-hand side deflected {{in the direction of the}} striker. His header was saved by goalkeeper Russell Hoult, who was unable to deny Kanu shooting the rebounded <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> net. Aliadière scored Arsenal's second goal of the match following Hoult's poor clearance.|$|E
5|$|It {{only took}} three minutes of extra {{time for the}} first goal to be scored. Thompson passed to Byrne, who cross was headed into the Leeds goal by Hunt.

Charlton headed the ball down to Bremner, whose shot beat Lawrence in the Liverpool goal to level the score at 1–1.|$|E
