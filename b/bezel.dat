5|$|In {{addition}} to fueling Hero actions, Bezels {{act as a}} safeguard to character defeat. Characters will not receive any direct damage {{as long as there}} is at least one <b>Bezel.</b> If there are enough Bezels remaining, receiving damage that would otherwise defeat the character instead causes the character to be knocked into the air and the <b>Bezel</b> is shattered into shards that scatter across the battlefield. If the player does not have any Bezels remaining, the characters go into critical mode. Critical mode causes the characters to become extremely scared, leaving them unable to shoot quickly, unable to use Hero actions, and taking direct damage from every attack. Four <b>Bezel</b> Shards must be collected by the characters in order to restore a <b>Bezel</b> and replenish their power, and enemies can even pick up <b>Bezel</b> Shards to regenerate health and shields. The game ends if any character is killed and there are no intact Bezels to protect them.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{necklaces}} features lion-headed terminals, {{and another}} includes stylized dolphins. The other four are relatively plain loop-in-loop chains, although {{one has a}} Chi-Rho symbol (☧) on the clasp, the only Christian element in the jewellery. Necklaces of similar lengths would normally be worn in the Roman period with a pendant, but no pendants {{were found in the}} hoard. The three rings were originally set with gems, which might have been natural gemstones, or pieces of coloured glass; however, these were taken from the rings before they were buried, perhaps for reuse. The rings are of similar design, one with an oval <b>bezel,</b> one with a circular <b>bezel,</b> and one with a large oblong <b>bezel.</b>|$|E

40|$|Tiled-monitor large {{displays}} {{are widely}} used in various application domains. However, how their interior <b>bezels</b> affect user performance and behavior has not been fully understood. We conducted three controlled experiments to investigate effects of tiled-monitor interior <b>bezels</b> on visual search, straight-tunnel steering, and target selection tasks. The conclusions of our paper are: 1) interior <b>bezels</b> do not affect visual search time nor error rate; however, splitting objects across <b>bezels</b> is detrimental to search accuracy, 2) interior <b>bezels</b> are detrimental to straight-tunnel steering, but not to target selection. In addition, we discuss how interior <b>bezels</b> affect user behaviors, and suggest guidelines for effectively using tiled-monitor large displays and designing user interfaces suited to them...|$|R

In general, people prefer a tiled display with smaller or no <b>bezels.</b> Our results show that a tiled display system which has <b>bezels</b> can allow a more lax synchronization among tiles compared to one without <b>bezels.</b> The results in terms of lower distortion visibility for the <b>bezels</b> case corresponds well with that from standard spatial vernier acuity threshold elevation as gap width increases.|$|R

25|$|Among {{the most}} plunderable portables from the Etruscan tombs of Etruria are the finely {{engraved}} gemstones set in patterned gold to form circular or ovoid pieces intended {{to go on}} finger rings. Of the magnitude of one centimeter, they are dated to the Etruscan floruit from {{the second half of}} the sixth to the first centuries BC. The two main theories of manufacture are native Etruscan and Greek. The materials are mainly dark red carnelian, with agate and sard entering usage from the third to the first centuries BC, along with purely gold finger rings with a hollow engraved <b>bezel</b> setting. The engravings, mainly cameo, but sometimes intaglio, depict scarabs at first and then scenes from Greek mythology, often with heroic personages called out in Etruscan. The gold setting of the <b>bezel</b> bears a border design, such as cabling.|$|E

25|$|Marc Gabolde {{contends that}} Tutankhaten never reigned {{for more than}} a few months at Amarna. He notes that while Akhenaten, Neferneferuaten and even Smenkhkare are attested as kings in Amarna, {{evidence}} for Tutankhaten is limited to some <b>bezel</b> rings. That is, evidence typically associated with a royal residence is lacking: there are no stamped bricks, reliefs or paintings; he is not mentioned or depicted in any private tombs, cult stela, royal depictions or documents; the result is that there is no evidence of King Tutankhaten in Amarna at all. Ring bezels and scarabs bearing his name found only shows the city was still inhabited during his reign. With Neferneferuaten scarcely attested outside Amarna and Tutankaten scarcely attested at Amarna, a coregency or regency seems unlikely.|$|E
25|$|Signet rings have a flat <b>bezel,</b> usually {{wider than}} the rest of the hoop, which is decorated, {{normally}} in intaglio, so that it will leave a raised (relief) impression of the design when the ring is pressed onto soft sealing wax or a similar material. They have been used since ancient times as the personal seal of an individual. In recent times the design is generally a crest, made by engraving, either in metal or engraved gems (generally semiprecious). Agate is a frequent material, especially carnelian or banded agate like sardonyx; the banding makes the impression contrast with the ground. Most smaller classical engraved gems were probably originally worn as signet rings, or as seals on a necklace. Metal signet rings can also be cast, which may be cheaper but yields a weaker material.|$|E

500|$|The Macintosh Classic was {{the final}} {{adaptation}} of Jerry Manock's and Terry Oyama's Macintosh 128K industrial design, bringing back some elements of the original, while retaining little of the Snow White design language used in the Macintosh SE's design. The only remnant of the SE was the stripe across the front panel (<b>bezel)</b> for the floppy drive; the distinctive front <b>bezel</b> lines of the SE were not used on the Classic, and the vertical lines around its base were replaced by four horizontal vent lines, more reminiscent of the original design. Also, {{the curve of the}} front <b>bezel</b> was increased to the same [...] radial curve as on the front of both the Macintosh LC and Macintosh IIsi. The screen brightness dial on this <b>bezel</b> was also removed in favor of a software control. This broad, curved front <b>bezel</b> became a signature of Apple product design for much of the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|The Retina Display MacBook Pro largely {{follows the}} design of the {{previous}} generation with its aluminum enclosure and separated black keys. The most apparent body changes are a thinner chassis and a display with a redesigned hinge and thinner <b>bezel</b> and the removal of the internal optical drive. The power button is moved from the upper right corner of the chassis onto the keyboard, taking the place of the optical disc eject button. At [...] thick, the 15-inch model is 25percent thinner than its predecessor. The model name is no longer placed {{at the bottom of the}} screen bezel; instead, it is found on the underside of the chassis, similar to an iOS device. It is the first Macintosh laptop to not have its model name visible during normal use, as every prior laptop had its model name on the screen <b>bezel</b> or keyboard.|$|E
500|$|The fourth {{generation}} MacBook Pro follows {{the design of}} the previous two generations with an all-metal unibody enclosure and separated black keys. A few apparent design changes are a thinner chassis, thinner screen <b>bezel,</b> larger trackpad, the OLED Touch Bar, and shallower butterfly mechanism keyboard with less key separation than the previous models. The speakers grilles have been relocated to the sides of the keyboard on the 13-inch variant. Tear downs show that the speaker grilles on the 13-inch model with Touch Bar are [...] "largely cosmetic", and that sound output mostly comes through the side vents. The {{fourth generation}} MacBook Pro comes in two finishes, the traditional silver color and a darker [...] "space gray" [...] color. The MacBook Pro model name returns {{to the bottom of the}} screen <b>bezel</b> in Apple's San Francisco font after being absent from the third generation. Similar to the Retina MacBook, the new models replace the backlit Apple logo on the rear of the screen with a glossy opaque version.|$|E

500|$|The G2's {{exterior}} {{consists of}} a polycarbonate shell—unlike its predecessor, which used a glass-based construction. The rear cover is adorned with a subtle pattern resembling carbon fiber. The G2's volume and power keys are located directly below the camera on {{the rear of the}} device. The power button contains an LED lamp, which {{can be used as a}} notification light. The positioning of the buttons on the rear deviates from the majority of smartphones, where they are located on the <b>bezel</b> (side edge) of the phone. LG argued that buttons located on the <b>bezel</b> were harder to reach on larger smartphones, and made it more likely for users to drop their phone when adjusting the volume during a call. As such, the G2's buttons are instead located where the index finger would normally lie when the phone is held. Alongside the power button, the G2 is also [...] powered on by double-tapping on the screen, and turned off by double-tapping on the status bar or a blank area on the home screen, a feature branded as [...] "KnockOn". When the phone is off, the volume keys can also be used to launch directly into the camera or QuickMemo applications by holding them down.|$|E
500|$|The G2 {{is powered}} by a 2.26GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 {{processor}} with 2GB of RAM and support for LTE or LTE Advanced networks where available. The G2 is equipped with a 5.2-inch 1080p IPS display; {{to reduce the size of}} its screen <b>bezel,</b> wiring for touchscreen components is routed both above and below the screen itself. To help conserve battery life, the G2 also implements a panel self-refresh system; if the display is showing static content, it is refreshed solely from framebuffer memory (referred to as [...] "graphics RAM"), allowing other display components (such as the GPU) to become idle. LG claimed that this system would allow the screen to use 26% less power than comparable displays on other smartphones.|$|E

The G2 is primarily distinguished by software features that LG billed would [...] "learn" [...] from users, a high fidelity sound system designed to produce higher quality audio, a [...] 1080p screen with technology that the company claimed would improve energy efficiency and {{reduce the size of}} the <b>bezel</b> around it, along with the unique placement of its power and volume keys—eschewing their typical location {{on the edge of a}} smartphone by placing them on the rear below the camera lens.|$|E
40|$|International audienceUsing tiled {{monitors}} {{to build}} wall-sized displays has multiple advantages: higher pixel density, simpler setup and easier calibration. However, the resulting display walls {{suffer from the}} visual discontinuity caused by the <b>bezels</b> that frame each monitor. To avoid introducing distortion, the image has to be rendered as if some pixels were drawn behind the <b>bezels.</b> In turn, this raises the issue that a non-negligible part of the rendered image, that might contain important information, is visually occluded. We propose to draw upon the analogy to french windows that {{is often used to}} describe this approach, and make the display really behave as if the visualization were observed through a french window. We present and evaluate two interaction techniques that let users reveal content hidden behind <b>bezels.</b> ePan enables users to offset the entire image through explicit touch gestures. GridScape adopts a more implicit approach: it makes the grid formed by <b>bezels</b> act like a true french window using head tracking to simulate motion parallax, adapting to users' physical movements in front of the display. The two techniques work for both single- and multiple-user contexts...|$|R
