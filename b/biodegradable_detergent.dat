40|$|International audienceLinear monoolefins with 10 to 14 carbon atoms are {{intermediates}} in {{the manufacture}} of <b>biodegradable</b> <b>detergent</b> products. These olefins can be obtained industrially by dehydrogenation of long chain paraffins on specific dehydrogenation catalysts under suitable operating conditions. The active phase of these catalysts is generally multimetallic, platinum-based modified by one or more promoters. Use of a high throughput experimentation approach may be interesting to optimise multimetallic formulations due firstly to the increasing number of possible formulations with the number of elements considered and secondly to the possible existence of nonlinear interactions between the elements. This article is therefore dedicated to a description of the high throughput experimentation tools used for preparation and catalytic evaluation during dehydrogenation of n-decane of alumina-supported "Pt-Sn-X" model catalysts, alongside the strategy used to optimise the formulation and the experimental results obtained in the predefined study domain. An approach based on the use of design of experiments to build a mathematical prediction model has been implemented to attempt to optimise the formulation of trimetallic "Pt-Sn-X" catalysts within a defined study domain. This approach could not be completed since the variation of the catalytic properties depending on the catalytic formulations of the design of experiments is not large enough with respect to the experimental variance. The results obtained nevertheless demonstrated a key concept to maximise the selectivity of a long chain paraffin dehydrogenation catalyst. At the same residual acidity and assuming that the formation of coproducts mainly involves bifunctional mechanisms for which the limiting step occurs on the acid phase, maximising the selectivity {{goes hand in hand with}} maximising the activity of the catalytic dehydrogenating function...|$|E

Glucaric acid, the dicarboxylic acid,is an important platform chemical with a plethora of applications as a <b>biodegradable</b> <b>detergent,</b> a corrosioninhibitor, and a monomer for a variety of polymers. It was included in the list of the most targeted products frombiomass by the US department of energy. 1 Encouraging yields of glucarate up to 54 % were obtained over Pt/C inalkaline medium. 2 However, the main drawback is the requirement of a base to neutralize the acids formed. Recent work has shown that base-free oxidation of glucose to glucaric acid can be achieved over Pt-Au/ZrO 2 bimetallic catalysts with a yield of 52 % in a batch reactor. 3 Nonetheless, there are also several by-productsformed by over-oxidation that limit the selectivity to glucaric acid. The aim {{of this study was to}} perform theoxidation of glucose over Pt-Au/ZrO 2 catalysts in continuous reactor to check the stability of the catalysts and toimprove the selectivity to glucaric acid. ExperimentalPt-Au/ZrO 2 catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation of ZrO 2 supports (MEL Chemicals, powder, SBET = 139 m 2 g- 1; Saint Gobain-Norpro, SZ 31163, 1 / 16 ? extrudates, SBET = 37 m 2 g- 1) with an aqueous solution ofHAuCl 4 and H 2 PtCl 6, and reduction with NaBH 4, as described in 4. They were prepared with different loadingsand atomic composition (measured by ICP-OES). XRD characterization showed the formation of a Au-Pt alloy. Glucose (0. 25 mol L- 1) oxidation was performed at 100 °C under 40 bar of air, either batchwise (300 mL autoclavewith sampling) or in a continuous mode in a trickle-bed reactor (12 mL tube containing 5 g catalyst) in down-flowmode; the reactor was equipped with an HPLC pump for the introduction of the glucose solution (6 mL h- 1), aback-pressure controller for the air flow (25 mL min- 1), and a G/L separator with a liquid level control device. Liquid product samples were periodically collected and analyzed by ionic chromatography with conductivity andamperometric detections. 2 Results and DiscussionFig. 1 shows how the main products evolved to glucaric acid as a function of time over Au 2. 5 wt%-Pt 3. 6 wt%/ZrO 2 (molar Au/Pt ratio = 0. 7) in batch reactor. Glucose was totally converted within 6 h. Gluconic, guluronic andglucaric acids were formed from the beginning of the reaction. The maximum yield in gluconic acid was ca. 20 %, itwas progressively oxidized up to completion after 10 h, and the maximum yield in glucaric acid was 45 % over thiscatalyst. Many by-products as C 2 -C 4 carboxylic (di) acids were detected including tartaric, tartronic, glyceric acidsand some carbon was lost to the gas phase. Fig. 2 compares conversion of glucose and yields in gluconic and glucaric acids as a function of time on streamover Au 0. 3 wt%-Pt 0. 7 wt%/ZrO 2 and Au 0. 7 wt%-Pt 1. 6 wt%/ZrO 2 (molar ratio Au/Pt ca. 0. 45). Both catalysts showedstable conversion and yields in gluconic and glucaric acid over a period of 200 h on stream. At total conversion ofglucose and while 8 % gluconic acid remained to be converted, the yield in glucaric acid was 55 % over the catalystcontaining the higher metal loading. Optimization of the catalyst composition may improve the yield in glucaricacid. The molar ratio Au/Pt of 1 was observed to be optimum in batch reactor. The yield in glucaric acid might stillbe improved in continuous reactor by optimization of the catalyst composition. In conclusion, Au-Pt/ZrO 2 catalysts prepared through a facile method of co-reduction of Au 3 + and Pt 2 + inaqueous solution with NaBH 4 were performant catalysts for the continuous oxidation of glucose (0. 25 mol L- 1) toglucaric acid. The stable yield in glucaric acid of 55 % with time on stream might be improved by varying thecomposition of the catalyst...|$|E

Anionic surface active agents can be produced from renewable natural raw materials such as vegetable oils mainly derived from palm oil.

40|$|Sugar {{fatty acid}} esters are of {{practical}} importance {{and have a}} variety of applications that include <b>biodegradable</b> <b>detergents</b> and emulsifiers in resin polymerization. Traditionally, they are synthesized chemically with low selectivity and different degrees of esterification. In this study, different sugar esters were enzymatically synthesized from a variety of sugars/sugar alcohols and fatty acids. The removal of water in an esterification reaction is critical in determining the reaction direction due to the reversibility of the reaction. Furthermore, if the water generated in the reaction is not removed continuously lower ester yields and a significant reduction in the activity and stability of immobilized enzymes can occur due to partial inhibition. The approach taken here was to investigate the feasibility of using Celite® supported sol-gel immobilized enzymes (CSSIE) as biocatalysts. The sol-gel consisted of PTMS (trimethoxypropylsilane) and TMOS (tetramethylorthosilicate) and was supported by three different types of Celite® – R 632, R 633 and R 647. CSSIE was dried and reused a number of times without a significant loss of activity. The CSSIE were found to behave as highly porous adsorbents with a high capacity to absorb water by selective uptake of polar substances. Their strong affinity for water not only prevented significant co-adsorption problems but also offered the consistent performance required for industrial applications. Maximum yield of product was obtained using CSSIE and results were compared to literature data using a variety of biocatalysts and moisture adsorbing media including unsupported sol-gels, Novozym, Celite® and molecular sieves. Although the moisture adsorbing capacity of the CSSIE decreased with reuse due to saturation, sol-gel aging marginally increased enzyme activity with a half life of 8 repeated uses with the highest conversion obtained when using the supported sol-gel 8 -days after initial preparation. No appreciable side products were observed for any of the reaction combinations examined and the highest product yield (96. 7 %) was obtained for the product sorbitan monooleate. Experiments were also conducted to determine conversion and moisture content as a function of substrate molar ratio, quantity of enzyme, type of solvent, nature of the fatty acid and reaction temperature. The highest conversion was obtained by the use of acetone as the reaction solvent, longer chain fatty acids and a reaction temperature of 40 °C. The maximum protein immobilization of 85 % of the supplied protein was obtained using sol-gel supported by Celite®-R 633. Sol-gel clusters {{on the surface of the}} Celite® were observed following repeated reuse of the CSSIE which may partially explain the decrease in conversion observed with reuse...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 83 - 97. Surfactants are {{the main}} components in detergents and they are primarily discharged from household and industry. Ammonia (or ionized form ammonium) is a byproduct of animal and human metabolism and it is formed in and discharged from aquaculture. Contamination of soil and water sources by surfactants and ammonium is becoming a big problem because of their harmful effects. These substances are highly toxic to many organisms, leading to possible mass deaths in the freshwater ecosystem. As their presence causes a potential environmental risk, industrial and household wastewater systems should be adequately treated to reduce the concentration of ammonium and surfactants. Chemical and biological methods are primarily used to treat wastewater systems. Biological treatment methods are more eco-friendly in comparison to chemical methods. Among biological treatment methods, the use of specific bacteria strains for removal of chemical contaminants is a widely applied process for treatment of industrial and municipal wastewater. However, those bacteria may not be capable of withstanding harsh environmental conditions or they may not specifically degrade the contaminant of interest, so isolation of bacterial strains more resistant to environmental extremes and more suitable for bioremoval is a possible strategy to improve current wastewater treatment strategies. By isolating bacteria well-adapted to the environmental and physical conditions of the system to be cleaned, very high efficiencies can be obtained for wastewater cleaning. To this end, a two-step approach was used. In {{the first part of}} this project, our aim was to find an integrated efficient biological based method to clean up industrial wastewater from anionic surfactants. Two main strategies were utilized to solve this problem: Finding and applying a more <b>biodegradable</b> and eco-friendly <b>detergent</b> alternative, and developing a biological treatment method specific for the anionic surfactants in the wastewater system of interest. It is expected that, by combining these two strategies, anionic surfactants in wastewater can be removed more efficiently. In the second part of this project, a novel bacterial strain, which we termed STB 1, was isolated from a commercial sea bass farm and found to display high heterotrophic ammonium removal characteristics. The species identity of STB 1 was determined to be Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. We evaluated ammonium removal characteristics of STB 1 at varying ammonium concentrations, and observed that STB 1 can almost completely remove ammonium at low (50 mg/l) and medium (100 mg/l) concentrations within 72 h, while 45...|$|R
