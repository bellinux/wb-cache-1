It has hence been considered as candidate material for the development of higher performance <b>beam</b> <b>intercepting</b> devices at CERN. Its brazing with a metal counterpart has been tested and characterized by means of microstructural and ultrasound techniques. Despite the positive results, its use has to be evaluated with care, due to the strong evidence in literature of large and permanent volumetric expansion, called swelling, under the effect of neutron and ion irradiation.

For this reason limited information is available for irradiation below 100 °C, which is the typical temperature of interest for <b>beam</b> <b>intercepting</b> devices like dumps or collimators.

40|$|In a collider, due to {{the lack}} of {{powerful}} electrostatic separators, the most efficient way to push up the collision frequency and to avoid, at the same time, parasitic interactions is to make the trajectories of the two op-posite <b>beams</b> <b>intercepting</b> at an angle.

This kind of instability, by limiting the maxi-mum achievable tune shift and, consequently the luminosity, defeated the purpose for which the crossing-angle scheme was designed. Very recently R. Palmer(1) proposed the well known crab-crossing idea to increase the luminosity in multibunch linear colliders. K. Oide and K.
