6000|$|And don't you {{remember}} (says the plate) how you alighted at Stoke - a picturesque heap of houses, kilns, smoke, wharfs, canals, and river, lying (as was most appropriate) in a basin - and how, after {{climbing up the}} sides of the basin to look at the prospect, you trundled down again at a walking-match pace, and straight proceeded to my father's, Copeland's, where the whole of my family, high and low, rich and poor, are turned out upon the world from our nursery and seminary, covering some fourteen acres of ground? And don't {{you remember}} what we spring from:- heaps of lumps of clay, partially prepared and cleaned in Devonshire and Dorsetshire, whence said clay principally comes - and hills of flint, without which we should want our ringing sound, and should never be musical? And as to the flint, don't you recollect that it is first burnt in kilns, and is then laid under the four iron feet of a demon slave, subject to violent stamping fits, who, when they come on, stamps away insanely with his four iron legs, and would crush all the flint in the Isle of Thanet to powder, without leaving off? And as to the clay, don't you recollect how it is put into mills or teazers, and is sliced, and dug, and cut at, by endless knives, clogged and sticky, but persistent - and is pressed out of that machine through a square trough, whose form it takes - and is cut off in square lumps and thrown into a vat, and there mixed with water, and beaten to a pulp by paddle-wheels - and is then run into a rough house, all rugged beams and ladders splashed with white, - superintended by Grindoff the Miller in his working clothes, all splashed with white, - where it passes through no end of machinery- moved sieves all splashed with white, arranged in an ascending scale of fineness (some so fine, that three hundred silk threads cross each other in a single square inch of their surface), and all in a violent state of ague with their teeth for ever chattering, and their bodies for ever shivering! And as to the flint again, isn't it mashed and mollified and troubled and soothed, exactly as rags are in a paper-mill, until it is reduced to a pap so fine that it contains no atom of 'grit' perceptible to the nicest taste? And as to the flint and the clay together, are they not, after all this, mixed in the proportion of five of clay to one of flint, and isn't the compound - known as 'slip' - run into oblong troughs, where its superfluous moisture may evaporate; and finally, isn't it slapped and banged and beaten and patted and kneaded and wedged and knocked about like <b>butter,</b> <b>until</b> it becomes a beautiful grey dough, ready for the potter's use? ...|$|E

50|$|Hugh Parnell {{started in}} the peanut {{business}} with Stewart Parnell and his two younger brothers in 1977; they took a struggling, $50,000-a-year peanut roasting operation {{and turned it into}} a $30 million business before selling the business in 1994-1995, after which Stewart Parnell continued on as a consultant until re-buying the Gorman, Texas plant in 2000. In 2001, he bought the Blakely, Georgia operation, when its operations consisted only of roasting and blanching peanuts. Parnell tripled revenue at the Blakely plant by 2004, turning its first profit in 15 years, with production regularly surpassing 2.5 million pounds of peanuts per month. However, the FDA did not know that the plant manufactured peanut <b>butter</b> <b>until</b> the 2008-2009 outbreak.|$|E

50|$|Born in Mayfield, Washington County, Wisconsin, Koch went to {{the public}} schools and Janssen's Institute in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He moved to Beechwood, in 1895, {{in the town of}} Scott, Sheboygan County, Wisconsin and {{manufactured}} cheese and <b>butter</b> <b>until</b> 1902. He then went into the general merchandising business and farming. Koch served as chairman of the Scott Town Board, in 1898, and as justice of the peace. He also served on the school board and was the clerk. In 1903, Koch served in the Wisconsin State Assembly and was a Republican. Koch was served on the Sheboygan County Board of Supervisors and was chairman of the county board. On April 21, 1908, Koch died suddenly of a stroke while sitting on a Wisconsin Circuit Court jury, at the Sheboygan County Court House, in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. His death remained unnoticed by the other jury members sitting next to him for several minutes.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} documented {{recipe for}} a meat-based sauce (ragù) served with pasta comes from late 18th century Imola, near Bologna. Pellegrino Artusi published a {{recipe for a}} meat sauce characterized as being bolognese in his cookbook published in 1891. Artusi's recipe, which he called Maccheroni alla bolognese, is thought to derive from the mid 19th century when he spent considerable time in Bologna (maccheroni being a generic term for pasta, both dried and fresh). The recipe only partially resembles the ragù alla bolognese that is traditionally associated with tagliatelle. The sauce called for predominantly lean veal filet along with pancetta, butter, onion, and carrot. The meats and vegetables were to be finely minced, cooked with <b>butter</b> <b>until</b> the meats browned, then covered and cooked with broth. Artusi commented that the taste could be made even more pleasant by adding small pieces of dried mushroom, a few slices of truffle, or chicken liver cooked with the meat and diced. As a final touch, he also suggested adding half a glass of cream to the sauce when it was completely done to make it taste even smoother. Artusi recommended serving this sauce with a medium size pasta ("horse teeth") made from durum wheat. The pasta was to be made fresh, cooked until it was firm, and then flavored with the sauce and Parmigiano cheese.|$|E
50|$|The {{area was}} {{settled in the}} late 1820s when graziers moved stock into the {{district}}. William Duggan Tarlinton was the first white man to {{set foot in the}} district in 1829, seeking pasture for his cattle. He later settled in the district and became one of its prominent citizens. By the 1830s the Imlay brothers had substantial holdings. Cobargo was known as 'The Junction' in the late 1860s as it was located at the junction of the Narira and Bredbatoura Creeks. A school opened in 1871 and by that year the village had a post office, store, hotel, church and blacksmith shops. Development gained pace following the construction of a bridge over the Narira Creek in 1882 and improvement of the coast road in the 1880s. By the 1890s the town was large enough to sustain a local newspaper, the Cobargo Watch. A butter factory was established in 1901 and continued <b>butter</b> production <b>until</b> 1980. In 1903 a branch of the Bank of New South Wales was opened. The office built in 1917 on the corner of Bermagui Road operated until 1997.|$|R

40|$|Allergen {{avoidance}} {{has been}} a major component of most programs for primary prevention of asthma and allergic diseases in childhood. As a part of the Childhood Asthma Prevention Study, families were provided with written and oral information on measures considered to be helpful in the primary prevention of allergic disease in high-risk infants. Dietary measures included advice to breastfeed for 6 months or longer, to delay the introduction of solid foods until after the infant turned 6 months of age, and to delay giving allergenic foods (egg and peanut <b>butter)</b> <b>until</b> after 12 months of age. In the active group of the randomized controlled trial aimed at reducing house dust mite (HDM) allergen levels, parents were advised to use an HDM-impermeable study mattress cover and an acaricide, to avoid sheep skins, and not to use a pillow before 12 months of age. Families received regular visits from the research nurses at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months and phone calls every 6 wk. Only 43. 4 % of mothers were breastfeeding by 6 months and less than 20 % by 12 months. The introduction of solid foods before 6 months was common, 26 % by 3 months and 96 % by 6 months. Adherence to infant-feeding recommendations was significantly greater in women over 30 yr of age, women who did not smoke during pregnancy, and women who had a tertiary education. Adherence to HDM reduction measures was greater than to those for infant feeding. The presence of symptoms {{in the form of an}} itchy rash by 4 wk did not significantly increase adherence. Complete adherence to infant-feeding recommendations in this intervention study of high-risk infants was low despite the provision of written information and reinforcement at home visits. In considering allergy prevention advice offered during clinical care, the likelihood of adherence is a factor which needs to be evaluated in assessing any potential benefits of allergy prevention regimens...|$|E

2500|$|Melted butter {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the preparation of sauces, most obviously in French cuisine. Beurre noisette (hazelnut butter) and Beurre noir (black butter) are sauces of melted <b>butter</b> cooked <b>until</b> the milk solids and sugars have turned golden or dark brown; they are often finished with an addition of vinegar or lemon juice. Hollandaise and béarnaise sauces are emulsions of egg yolk and melted butter; they are in essence mayonnaises made with butter instead of oil. Hollandaise and béarnaise sauces are stabilized with the powerful emulsifiers in the egg yolks, but butter itself contains enough emulsifiers—mostly remnants of the fat globule membranes—to form a stable emulsion on its own. Beurre blanc (white butter) is made by whisking butter into reduced vinegar or wine, forming an emulsion with the texture of thick cream. Beurre monté (prepared butter) is melted but still emulsified butter; it lends its name to the practice of [...] "mounting" [...] a sauce with butter: whisking cold butter into any water-based sauce at the end of cooking, giving the sauce a thicker body and a glossy shine—as well as a buttery taste.|$|R

Addition of hot water at the middle of the process can fasten the process but care should be given to the period and amount of water to be added. Addition of more water at the latter stages of the process can significantly decrease the butter content. The completion of the process is detected by moving the Pora around the surface of the churned liquid where butter separates from rest of the liquid and accumulate into a mould. It takes about 20 minutes. Then, butter is taken out and collected, while churned milk (Nepali:मोही) is collected in Dhungro.|$|R
50|$|Edgeley {{is a small}} unincorporated {{community}} {{located in}} Vaughan, in York Region, Ontario, Canada. The first inhabitants of the Edgeley area came from Somerset County, Pennsylvania, circa 1800. Early family names were Smith, Stong, Shunk, Hoover, Burkholder, Muskrat, Snider, Brown, and Dalziel. A Mennonite church, built of logs in 1824 on the northern portion of Lot #7, Concession #4, {{was one of the}} first churches built in Vaughan Township. A steam-powered shingle mill stood on the northwest corner of Highway 7 and Jane Street. A hotel was located on the northeast corner, with a general store on the southeast corner. The store contained the Edgeley post-office from 1872-1960. Just south of the store, Samuel Snider operated a horse-powered cider mill. His son-in-law, Abraham Winger, and Abraham's brother Henry later took over the business, putting up a new steam-powered mill and producing apple cider, <b>butter</b> and jelly <b>until</b> the early 1900s.|$|R
50|$|By 1950 {{the farms}} of the South Burnett were stocked with 130,000 dairy cows, {{ten percent of}} the Queensland total. The Kingaroy Butter Factory {{maintained}} an average production of 75 tons of <b>butter</b> per week <b>until</b> the early 1950s. Factory improvements in this period included the purchase of a new butter wrapping machine for £2000 in 1950, and the installation of stainless steel equipment for treating cream in 1956. Such improvements, however, were not enough to protect the factory from the beginnings of a wider decline of Queensland's dairy industry, as demand and prices for butter began to drop. The downturn worsened in the 1960s, with a reduction in cream suppliers diminishing output. The transition towards the production of milk rather than cream, requiring larger herds and new equipment, saw many smaller scale farmers leaving the industry. In Kingaroy Shire cream suppliers fell dramatically, from 265 in 1965 to 155 in 1969. Correspondingly, between 1960 and 1968 the number of dairy cows in the Shire fell from 23,885 to 12,225. Export opportunities also became restricted, culminating with the end of preferential trade agreements with Britain following its entry into the European Common Market in 1973.|$|R
40|$|Reviews {{the rural}} {{smallholder}} milk production and utilisation in Ethiopia and discusses {{the future for}} dairy development. Looks into the smallholder milk processing techniques in the highlands of Ethiopia. It is found that milk produced by smallholders is used for family consumption {{and the production of}} butter and a cottage-type cheese. For butter making, milk is collected over a period of three or four days in a clay pot. When the milk has soured and sufficient milk has been collected, the pot is shaken back and forth <b>until</b> <b>butter</b> granules are formed. The buttermilk remaining after the butter is separated from the whole milk is used to produce a cottage type cheese by heating the buttermilk and separating the coagulated fat and protein from the whey. The various options and outlets for milk and milk products available to rural smallholder milk producers are shown.
