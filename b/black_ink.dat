5|$|The text of a Book of the Dead {{was written}} in both black and red ink, {{regardless}} of whether it was in hieroglyphic or hieratic script. Most of the text was in black, with red ink used for the titles of spells, opening and closing sections of spells, the instructions to perform spells correctly in rituals, and also for the names of dangerous creatures such as the demon Apep. The <b>black</b> <b>ink</b> used was based on carbon, and the red ink on ochre, in both cases mixed with water.|$|E
5|$|The peak of sutra copying {{occurred}} in the Nara period at which time the Great Perfection of Wisdom (Daihannya) sutra and the Lotus Sutra were the sutras most often copied. Most of the sutras were written in <b>black</b> <b>ink</b> on paper dyed pale yellow. However, some were made with gold or silver ink on indigo, purple or other colored paper—particularly {{the ones that were}} produced in 741 when Emperor Shōmu decreed Konkōmyō Saishōō sutras written in gold letters be distributed among provincial temples. Many sutra copies contain a colophon with the name of the sponsor—often somebody from the ruling class—and the reason of copying, usually related to the health or salvation of people or the state.|$|E

5|$|After Lincoln's {{assassination}} in April 1865, <b>black</b> <b>ink</b> {{was thrown}} on Fillmore's house {{as it was}} not draped in mourning like others, though he was apparently out of town {{at the time and}} put black drapes in the windows once he returned. Although he retained his position as Buffalo's leading citizen and was among those selected to escort the body when Lincoln's funeral train passed through Buffalo, there was still anger against him for his wartime positions. Fillmore supported President Andrew Johnson's Reconstruction policies, feeling that the nation needed to be reconciled as quickly as possible. Most of his time was devoted to his civic activities. He aided Buffalo in becoming the third American city, after Boston and Philadelphia, to have a permanent art gallery with the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of {{life from the}} disintegration of an Engineer in the film's opening scene was created by WETA Digital. The scene was difficult to produce because it had to convey {{the story of the}} Engineer's DNA breaking apart, reforming and recombining into Earth DNA in a limited span of time. The team focused on making the DNA stages distinct to convey its changing nature. Scott requested the studio to focus on the destruction occurring within the Engineer. A light color scheme was used for the Engineer's DNA and decayed fish spines were used as an image reference, while the infected DNA had a melted appearance. To find methods of depicting the DNA destruction, the team carved vein-like structures from silicone and pumped <b>black</b> <b>ink</b> and oils into them while filming the changes occurring {{over an extended period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{is written}} primarily in insular majuscule with some occurrences of minuscule letters (usually e or s). The text is usually written in one long line across the page. Françoise Henry identified {{at least three}} scribes in this manuscript, whom she named Hand A, Hand B, and Hand C. Hand A is found on folios 1 through 19v, folios 276 through 289, and folios 307 {{through the end of}} the manuscript. Hand A, for the most part, writes eighteen or nineteen lines per page in the brown gall-ink common throughout the West. Hand B is found on folios 19r through 26 and folios 124 through 128. Hand B has a somewhat greater tendency to use minuscule and uses red, purple and <b>black</b> <b>ink</b> and a variable number of lines per page. Hand C is found throughout the majority of the text. Hand C also has greater tendency to use minuscule than Hand A. Hand C uses the same brownish gall-ink used by hand A and wrote, almost always, seventeen lines per page.|$|E

40|$|Hundreds of {{millions}} of people worldwide have tattoos, which predominantly contain <b>black</b> <b>inks</b> consisting of soot products like Carbon Black or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). We recently found up to 200 mg/g of PAH in commercial <b>black</b> <b>inks.</b> After skin tattooing, a substantial part of the ink and PAH should be transported to other anatomical sites like the regional lymph nodes. To allow a first estimation of health risk, we aimed to extract and quantify the amount of PAH in black tattooed skin and the regional lymph nodes of pre-existing tattoos. Firstly, we established an extraction method by using HPLC – DAD technology that enables the quantification of PAH concentrations in human tissue. After that, 16 specimens of human tattooed skin and corresponding regional lymph nodes were included in the study. All skin specimen and lymph nodes appeared deep black. The specimens were digested and tested for 20 different PAH at the same time. PAH were found in twelve of the 16 tattooed skin specimens and in eleven regional lymph nodes. The PAH concentration ranged from 0. 1 – 0. 6 mg/cm 2 in the tattooed skin and 0. 1 – 11. 8 mg/g in the lymph nodes. Two major conclusions can be drawn from the present results. Firstly, PAH in <b>black</b> <b>inks</b> stay partially in skin or {{can be found in the}} regional lymph nodes. Secondly, the major part of tattooed PAH had disappeared from skin or might be found in other organs than skin and lymph nodes. Thus, beside inhalation and ingestion, tattooing has proven to be an additional, direct and effective route of PAH uptake into th...|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, rubbings {{have been}} made by tamping or rubbing <b>black</b> <b>inks</b> or waxes on white rice paper which are {{stretched}} over carved stone, wood or metal. With rice paper hard to come by, Joan used oil pigments lightly tamped on stretched dyed cloth. The combination of coloured fabrics and inks produced a polychromatic blueprint of the carved relief with crisp, well-defined lines outlining both figures and hieroglyphic passages.|$|R
25|$|The printed format {{has gone}} through several changes. The first publications, in 1967–72, were in folded tabloid {{newspaper}} format, with no staples, <b>black</b> <b>ink</b> text, and a single color highlight that changed each edition. From 1973 onwards, editions were produced on a four-color press with a different newsprint paper size. In 1979, the bar code appeared. In 1980, it became a gloss-paper, large format (10"×12") magazine. As of edition of October 30, 2008, Rolling Stone has had a smaller, standard-format magazine size.|$|E
25|$|The <b>black</b> <b>ink</b> framing lines drawn {{around each}} design {{are thought to}} have been added at a later date, {{possibly}} in 1818, just prior to Blake giving the plates to John Linnell. The ink and wash work in the designs themselves may also have been executed at that time, although this cannot be ascertained for certain. It has been suggested that the framing lines may have been added due to the discrepancy between the size of the plates {{and the size of the}} paper (each sheet is 37.8 x 27cm.).|$|E
