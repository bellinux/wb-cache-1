25|$|Only a {{fraction}} of the permafrost zone consists of actual ground ice. The remainder (dry permafrost) is simply soil or rock at subfreezing temperatures. The ice volume is generally greatest in the uppermost permafrost layers and mainly comprises pore and segregated ice in Earth material. Measurements of bore-hole temperatures in permafrost can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>indicators</b> of net changes in temperature regime. Gold and Lachenbruch (1973) infer a 2-4nbsp&°C warming over 75 to 100 years at Cape Thompson, Alaska, where the upper 25% of the 400-m thick permafrost is unstable with respect to an equilibrium profile of temperature with depth (for the present mean annual surface temperature of -5nbsp&°C). Maritime influences may have biased this estimate, however. At Prudhoe Bay similar data imply a 1.8nbsp&°C warming over the last 100 years (Lachenbruch et al. 1982). Further complications may be introduced by changes in snow-cover depths and the natural or artificial disturbance of the surface vegetation.|$|E

Parkinson states that the titles of a work, its opening statement, or key words found {{in the body of}} text should <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>indicators</b> of its particular genre.

500|$|Although verbal {{report is}} in {{practice}} the [...] "gold standard" [...] for ascribing consciousness, {{it is not}} the only possible criterion. [...] In medicine, consciousness is assessed as a combination of verbal behavior, arousal, brain activity and purposeful movement. [...] The last three of these can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>indicators</b> of consciousness when verbal behavior is absent. [...] The scientific literature regarding the neural bases of arousal and purposeful movement is very extensive. [...] Their reliability as indicators of consciousness is disputed, however, due to numerous studies showing that alert human subjects can be induced to behave purposefully in a variety of ways in spite of reporting a complete lack of awareness. [...] Studies of the neuroscience of free will have also shown that the experiences that people report when they behave purposefully sometimes do not correspond to their actual behaviors or to the patterns of electrical activity recorded from their brains.|$|E

30|$|Equity in {{education}} is often measured by, for example, {{the effect of}} socioeconomic background (SES) on students’ academic achievement and differences in outcomes between schools and students.

One way to achieve such decomposition <b>is</b> to <b>use</b> Bourdieu’s concepts, cultural and economic capital (see, e.g., Åberg-Bengtsson 2005; Gustafsson 1998; Yang 2003).
