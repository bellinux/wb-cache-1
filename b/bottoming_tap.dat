5000|$|<b>Bottoming</b> <b>tap</b> or plug tap: [...] The tap {{illustrated}} {{in the top of}} the image has a continuous cutting edge with almost no taper — between 1 and 1.5 threads of taper is typical. [...] This feature enables a <b>bottoming</b> <b>tap</b> to cut threads to the bottom of a blind hole. A <b>bottoming</b> <b>tap</b> is usually used to cut threads in a hole that has already been partially threaded using one of the more tapered types of tap; the tapered end ("tap chamfer") of a <b>bottoming</b> <b>tap</b> is too short to successfully start into an unthreaded hole. In the US, they are commonly known as bottoming taps, but in Australia and Britain they are also known as plug taps.|$|E
50|$|With soft or average {{hardness}} materials, such as plastic, aluminum or mild steel, {{the common}} practice {{is to use}} an intermediate (plug) tap to cut the threads. If the threads are to extend {{to the bottom of}} a blind hole, the intermediate (plug) tap will be used to cut threads until the point of the tap reaches bottom, after which a <b>bottoming</b> <b>tap</b> will be used to finish the hole. Frequent ejection of the chips must be made in such an operation to avoid jamming and possibly breaking the tap. With hard materials, the machinist may start with a taper tap, whose less severe diameter transition reduces the amount of torque required to cut the threads. If threads are to be cut to the bottom of a blind hole, the taper tap will be followed by an intermediate (plug) tap and then a <b>bottoming</b> <b>tap</b> to finish the operation.|$|E

50|$|To use a {{separatory}} funnel, the {{two phases}} and {{the mixture to}} be separated in solution are added through the top with the stopcock at the bottom closed. The funnel is then closed and shaken gently by inverting the funnel multiple times; if the two solutions are mixed together too vigorously emulsions will form. The funnel is then inverted and the tap carefully opened to release excess vapor pressure. The separating funnel is set aside {{to allow for the}} complete separation of the phases. The top and the <b>bottom</b> <b>tap</b> are then opened and the lower phase is released by gravitation. The top must be opened while releasing the lower phase to allow pressure equalization between the inside of the funnel and the atmosphere. When the bottom layer has been removed, the stopcock is closed and the upper layer is poured out through the top into another container.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Bottom</b> bracket <b>taps</b> {{and facing}} tools are tools used to tap or chase the threads {{in the bottom}} bracket shell and face the outside edges, respectively. A single tool will {{sometimes}} handle both jobs, and is usually suitable for light-duty bicycle shop use. A separate tap set and facing set is usually employed by frame builders where more robust tooling that is more frequently used is needed. Both tap sets and facing sets are intended for frame finishing work after welding and/or brazing, as the frame tubes tend to deform slightly after this process, and for cleaning out any weld splatter or paint from the bottom bracket threads.

40|$|An {{observational}} {{study of the}} electric arc furnace (EAF) process for austenitic stainless steel was performed. A comparison was made between two distinct EAF types: (1) an eccentric <b>bottom</b> <b>tapping</b> furnace (EBTF) and (2) a spout tapping furnace (STF). In order to study the slag evolution during the EAF process, per heat several slag samples were collected at consecutive process stages. They were subjected to electron probe microanalysis using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EPMA-EDS). Compositional and mineralogical data from 36 heats corroborate that both thermodynamic and kinetic conditions exert a strong influence on the final chromium oxide content of the slag. In the STF, chromium oxide reduction predominantly occurs during tapping, owing to the intimate mixing of steel and slag. A multivariate linear regression analysis reveals that the main parameters determining the overall chromium recovery are the slag basicity {{and the content of}} dissolved silicon of the steel. These parameters explain 70 % of the observed variance in final chromium oxide levels and can be used as control parameters to improve the chromium recovery. For the EBTF, lower chromium recoveries are recorded due to the absence of sufficient mixing during tapping. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{microstructural}} {{evolution of}} the slag during the electric arc furnace (EAF) austenitic stainless steelmaking was investigated with respect to its effect on chromium recovery and slag foaming. Two distinct EAF types were followed up: (1) an eccentric <b>bottom</b> <b>tapping</b> furnace (EBTF) and (2) a spout tapping furnace (STF). Slag samples were collected from 36 industrial heats at three (EBTF) or five (STF) distinct moments in the process. The microstructure of the slag samples was characterised with electron probe microanalysis using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EPMA-EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). From the microstructural analysis it is concluded that at the processing temperature the slag consists of a liquid slag matrix, {{two different types of}} metallic particles and MgO center dot(Al,Cr) (2) O- 3 -based spinel particles. The {{evolution of the}} microstructure is highlighted, the interactions between the phases are discussed and the effects of changing conditions on the slag microstructure are illustrated by thermodynamic calculations. Special attention is given to the effect of slag basicity on the activity of chromium oxide in the slag. It is shown that a thorough study of the microstructural evolution of the slag is instrumental to understanding and improving slag foaming and chromium recovery. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|The unusual {{design of}} this {{lifeboat}} {{derives from the}} requirement to deploy from slipway stations built for previous generations of lifeboats, with limited clearance. The Tyne also lies afloat at stations where the approaches, or operating areas, are particularly shallow. As the lifeboat's propellers are protected by heavy bilge keels, she is particularly well suited to operate {{where there is a}} danger of hitting the <b>bottom,</b> or <b>tapping</b> as it is known colloquially. The Tyne has a steel hull and aluminium superstructure. The first two were powered by General Motors 8V-71 diesels of 425 bhp, but the production boats switched to the newer GM 6V-92 of the same power. In the 1990s some boats were re-engined with Detroit Diesel 92 DDEC six-cylinder engines of 565 bhp. During the course of production the weight of the boats increased by over 1 ton; this required an increase in superstructure volume to preserve the self-righting capability, resulting in the height of the aft cabin being raised. Later, further doubts about the self-righting capability resulted in air bags being added to the aft cabin roof.|$|R
5000|$|Dance was an {{entertainment}} piece that was accepted {{in almost every}} act slot on the bill for a Vaudeville show. Tap, a term coined with the Ziegfeld Follies in 1902, was a style that was often seen. It started before the Civil War from mimicking and mocking their white master's stiff movements. During that same time hamboning was invented. Without drubs, hamboning {{was a way of}} creating percussion sounding beats with their chests and thighs. In the 1870s and 1880s hamboning was mixed with clog-shoe dances, and Irish jigs to create tap. Vaudeville had seen two types of tap: buck-and-wing and four-four time soft shoe. Buck-and-wing consisted of gliding, sliding, and stomping movements at high speeds. Wing was a portion in which on a jump, feet would continue to dance in mid air. Soft shoe was more relaxed and elegant. Metal plates were added to the <b>bottom</b> of <b>tap</b> shoes to create a stronger percussion sound. However, after eight minutes of dancing the wooden Vaudeville stage would easily tatter. The theater owners replaced the section of the stage that was in front of the curtain with high-quality durable maple wood. That way they would not have to change the entire stage and they could have an “in-one-number” act; this would be an act that was performed with the curtain as a backdrop so that the set could be changed for the following act. Therefore, the audience will not think about leaving as they wait for the set to be changed. Famous tappers of the time and who are still famous today include Buster Brown and the Seeped Kings, Beige&Brown and Bill [...] "Bojangles" [...] Robinson.|$|R
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{is concerned with}} experimental studies of the conditions for CeS formations during manufacturing of Ce-S/Ce-S-Al/Ce-S-Al-Fe based grain refiners for steels. The thesis is divided into five parts. Part I gives a general introduction {{to the concept of}} steel grain refinement by means of heterogeneous nucleation of acicular ferrite at non-metallic inclusions during the austenite to ferrite transformation. In Part II the conditions for cerium oxide and oxysulphide formation during manufacturing of CeS-based grain refiners for steel have been examined. The small vacuum furnace used in these laboratory experiments is equipped with a graphite heating element, where both the temperature-time programme and the partial pressure of oxygen can be accurately controlled and monitored throughout the melting trials. The results from the optical and electron microprobe examinations of the as-solidified samples show that the liquid Ce-S-Fe-Al melt is prone to oxidation up to about 1600 to 1800 ˚C before the graphite heating element starts to act as an effective oxygen scavenger. The oxidation leads to conversion of CeS to Ce 2 O 2 S, which is an undesirable microconstituent in the grain refiners. In practice, the problem can be overcome by the use of rapid heating of the melt, which in the present small-scale laboratory experiments needs to be as high as 1000 ˚C/min in order to kinetically suppress the oxygen absorption from the shielding gas. In Part III the phase relations within the Ce-Al-Fe-S system have been clarified, using a combination of optical microscopy and WDS microprobe analyses. As a starting point highpurity charge materials of cerium, aluminium and FeS 2 are melted and superheated to about 2000 ˚C within small tantalum crucibles inside a dedicated laboratory furnace filled with cleaned argon. The phases detected in the as-solidified samples were CeS, Ce 3 Al, Fe 2 Ce and γ-Ce, along with Ce 2 O 2 S, which is an undesirable microconstituent in CeS-based grain refiners. It is concluded that FeS 2 {{can be used as a}} sulphur source for addition up to about 4 wt% sulphur. At higher levels the Fe-Ta interaction becomes so vigorous that tantalum no longer acts as an inert refractory metal and wetting becomes a major problem. In contrast, aluminium is an essential alloying element in the sense that it prevents the grain refiners from disintegrating in contact with air due to internal oxidation of free cerium by promoting the formation of Ce 3 Al. In Part IV the phase relations within the Ce-S-Al system have been clarified, using a combination of optical microscopy and WDS microprobe analyses. As a starting point high purity charge materials of cerium, aluminium and Ce 2 S 3 were melted and superheated to about 2000 ˚C within small tantalum crucibles inside a dedicated laboratory furnace filled with cleaned argon. The main constituent phases detected in the as-solidified samples are CeS, Ce 3 Al, CeAl and γ-Ce, where the CeS phase constitutes a discontinuous dendritic network within the grain refiners. The melting experiments show that pure cerium can dissolve about 6 wt% of sulphur at 2000 oC which drops to approximately 1. 8 wt% at 1500 oC. The measured sulphur solubility is considerable lower than that inferred from the existing binary Ce-S phase diagram, which therefore should be revised to comply with these new measurements. Because alloying with aluminium reduces the sulphur solubility in liquid cerium, the addition of this element should be restricted if a high volume fraction of CeS is desired in the grain refiners. At the same time the use of Ce 2 S 3 as a sulphur source in replacement of pyrite (FeS 2) means that aluminium is not actually needed to prevent the grain refiners from disintegrating in contact with air due to internal oxidation. Finally, in Part V up-scaled production of the CeS-based grain refiners has been attempted. As a starting point, batches of about 0. 5 kg are made from high purity charge materials of γ-Ce and Ce 2 S 3 within a suitable molybdenum crucible using an inductive heating chamber furnace filled with pure argon. Following casting in a water-cooled copper mould, the main phases observed in the as-solidified samples are γ-Ce and CeS. Also some Ce 2 O 2 S could be detected, but the amount is small, meaning that oxygen pick-up is not a major problem in these up-scaled melting experiments. Furthermore, attempts have been made to re-melt and rapidly solidify one of the produced grain refiners using melt spinning. The experiments show that a fine distribution of spherical-shaped CeS particles with a mean diameter close to 1 µm can be produced by means of this technique. This size is deemed to be optimal with respect to nucleation of acicular ferrite in steels during the austenite to ferrite transformation. Finally, a new and improved production method for CeS-based grain refiners has been suggested, which allows large quantities of materials to be melted, superheated and rapidly quenched in a single batch operation. The idea here is to use gas atomization as the main quenching technique for liquid cerium instead of melt spinning in combination with induction heating and <b>bottom</b> <b>tapping</b> of the crucible.

50|$|The Four Fords were {{a popular}} group of tap dancers {{in the early}} 1900s. The group {{was made up of}} four {{siblings}}, Max Ford, Edwin Ford, Dora Ford and Mabel Ford. They also had another brother named Jonny Ford, he was a dancer as well but never toured with his siblings (Watson). When the fords were children, they were taught to dance very early in their life (Mable Ford). They learned many different types of dancing. Their brother Jonny Ford toured as a ballroom dancer (Watson). The Four Ford became popular around 1910. In 1913 The Four Fords broke up, but Mable and Dora kept touring as the Ford Sisters. Max Ford also toured with Hetty Urma-Ford Max’s second wife (Watson). It is believed that after Max left The Four Fords he became a successful movie choreographer. The Fords clogged danced, tap danced, and soft shoe danced (An Art of Infinite Variety). With Clog dancing the dancers would wear wooden shoes with split soles (Kaiserman). The danced started in England, the Netherlands, Ireland, and Germany. Clog dancing was originally a folk dance, and was an early form of tap dancing because the dancers would make noise with their shoes. Around the 1900s soft-shoe dancing started, in the melting pot of America. Different Cultures brought their different styles of dance. It is believed that the African dance styles were mixed with European styles and became rhythmic and fluid (archive.itvs.org).Dancers didn’t start wearing metal at the <b>bottom</b> of their <b>tap</b> shoes until around 1910 (archive.itvs.org). The Four Fords started to become famous at this time as well. It was a revolutionary time for tap dancing, and Highbrow magazine even references it as “the birth of tap”. The Fords {{were in the midst of}} it all. They became celebrities of their time. The Fords were vaudeville dancers (Watson). This meant that they were often in humorous variety shows. The Vaudeville shows were popular from the 1910 to the 1930s when they were beat out by the film industry (Kaiserman).|$|R
