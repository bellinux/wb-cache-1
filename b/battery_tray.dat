50|$|The {{principal}} identifiers of {{an electric}} Ranger are {{the appearance of the}} front charging door in a grille location that is open on ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) Rangers, the missing tailpipe, and the visibility of the EV's unique rear suspension and the traction motor from behind the vehicle. From the side, the vehicle is almost indistinguishable from the ICE Ranger except for a modest script Electric on the side. Only the slight projection of the <b>battery</b> <b>trays</b> below the frame rails is noticeable at a distance. Vehicle height is close to that of four-wheel drive vehicles.|$|R
2500|$|The first LRVs entered {{service on}} the [...] "D" [...] Branch in December 1976 but were {{immediately}} beset with problems. Certain cars frequently derailed on tight turns in the Riverside, Boston College and Lechmere yards. <b>Battery</b> <b>trays,</b> air conditionersmounted under the cars, continually drawing in dirt and debris from under the car when in the tunnelsand air compressors all suffered numerous failures; the plug-style doors had trouble sealing properly; and traction motors failed sooner than expected. Desperate for reliable rolling stock, the MBTA launched an overhaul program to extend the availability of its older PCC cars. A total of 15 cars, primarily out-of-service wrecks and parts cars, were rebuilt to as-new condition.|$|R

5000|$|As {{found by}} journalists such as Car and Driver in their September 1997 issue's {{comparison}} of [...] "Best Handling Car {{for more than}} $30K", the NSX, due to its mid-engine layout and rear-end link travel, was susceptible to a sudden oversteer condition during certain cornering maneuvers. While this condition rarely occurred during spirited street driving, {{it was much more}} prevalent on race tracks where speeds were much higher. To address the problem and improve the NSX-R's cornering stability at the limit, Honda added one aluminum bracket under the front <b>battery</b> <b>tray</b> and added one aluminum bracket in front of the front radiator to add more chassis rigidity then replaced the entire suspension with stiffer front sway bar, stiffer suspension bushings, stiffer coil springs and stiffer dampers.|$|E

Only 398 Mustangs were built with the drag race oriented R code motor and was designated as the 351 HO. Mandatory options were the top loader 4 speed, competition N case rear end (427, 428, 429, Boss 351, 351HO), and air conditioning delete. Vacuum operated Ram Air was not available, however the HO came with the first full time cold air induction system in a Mustang, routing cold air via a 2 piece plastic duct under the <b>battery</b> <b>tray</b> to the air cleaner snorkel. All 351 HO cars were manufactured in Dearborn, MI.|$|E

40|$|This {{report was}} written {{for the design of}} a <b>battery</b> <b>tray</b> and {{manufacturing}} process for S 2 ̆ 6 G Metal Fab. The manufacturing steps of how to process the sheet metal to create the product are defined and documented in this report. This project began with constraints given by S 2 ̆ 6 G and were all accomplished using coursework knowledge obtained as a manufacturing engineer student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. This report mainly covers parameters regarding the cutting, bending and, deforming of sheet metal to acquire the desired shapes and sizes. It also analyzes the costs that are associated with these processes and material. 5052 h 32 aluminum sheet metal with a thickness of. 090 ” was used to create a <b>battery</b> <b>tray</b> that would be adequate for off- road use.

40|$|IEK- 3 at Forschungszentrum Jülich {{successfully}} {{replaced the}} <b>battery</b> <b>tray</b> of a horizontal order picker (ECE 220, Jungheinrich) with a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) hybrid {{system in the}} kilowatt class. The DMFC combined with a lithium-ion battery forms the hybrid drive for electrically driven horizontal order pickers. Such vehicles are used to transport and collect goods for orders in warehouses. The order picker is fueled by pure methanol to achieve a maximum range with the smallest possible space for the <b>battery</b> <b>tray.</b> An advantage of such energy systems {{is that there is}} no need for the relatively complicated and time-consuming recharging of the conventional lead-acid batteries, nor are spare batteries required for multishift operation. This study focuses on the influence of contamination with inorganic impurities on the durability of the 1 [*]kW DMFC system V 3. 3 - 1. The data from a long-term test will be presented, in which the DMFC system was subjected to a realistic dynamic load profile for 3, 000 [*]h. The impurities identified in the post-mortem analysis of the membrane electrode assembly will be outlined as well the influence of selected impurities, the sources of these impurities and how the DMFC V 3. 3 - 2 system was modified on the basis of these finding...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the accuracy and {{utility of the}} Eiken Systek No. 1 (Eiken system; Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), we conducted a clinical comparison, with 345 Enterobacteriaceae isolates, of the Eiken System with API 20 E (Analytab Products, Inc., Plainview, N. Y.) and conventional methods. The Eiken system is a 21 -biochemical-test <b>battery</b> <b>tray</b> stored at 25 degrees C and inoculated in one step. It {{is similar to the}} API 20 E except that the Eiken system contains malonate, adonitol, and maltose; lacks gelatin, sucrose, melibiose, amygdalin, and arabinose; and uses reagent strips instead of liquid reagents. The API 20 E and Eiken systems correctly identified 339 (97. 7 %) and 276 (79. 5 %), respectively, and misidentified 3 (0. 9 %) and 13 (3. 7 %), respectively, of the isolates. There were no identification codes for 5 (1. 4 %) organisms with the API 20 E and 58 (16. 7 %) organisms with the Eiken system; of these latter unidentified organisms, 42 were identified as Proteus spp., Morganella sp., and Providencia rettgeri by conventional methods. There {{was no significant difference between}} the two rapid systems in total time required for inoculation and reading. Modifications for interpretation of decarboxylase and oxidase tests were needed for the Eiken system, and manipulation of reagent strips required considerable dexterity. However, the Eiken system was easier to inoculate than the API 20 E, and, with minor increases in the data base to include more of the Proteus and Morganella spp. and P. rettgeri, the system should be reliable for identification of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae...|$|E
40|$|With {{a proven}} life of 20, 000 {{operation}} {{hours in a}} lifetime test with a realistic dynamic load profile, the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) system V 3. 3 - 2 represents a milestone for the commercialization of DMFC systems. The hybrid DMFC system V 3. 3 - 2 comprises an in active serial connected 1. 0 kW DMFC system and a 45 Ah lithium-ion high-power battery pack. This hybrid system replaces the <b>battery</b> <b>tray</b> of a class 3 forklift truck and can supply a peak load of 7 kW. The advantages of this energy-supply module compared to conventional lead-acid batteries are its higher range (24 h use with a 20 L methanol canister instead of 8 h with battery recharging) and its higher availability (a few minutes are required to exchange methanol canisters instead of hours to recharge the battery). However, {{in order to ensure}} that use of the DMFC system V 3. 3 - 2 is economic, the DMFC stack must have a durability of at least 10, 000 h. This publication describes the degradation behavior of the DMFC stack and of the energy storage system during a lifetime test of the DMFC system V 3. 3 - 2 with a dynamic load profile of a material handling vehicle. In the first-ever test worldwide lasting 25, 600 h, the hybrid system is successfully operated for 20, 000 h. Operation for 20, 000 hours is equivalent to the life cycle of a vehicle in the material handling sector. The development and validation of the DMFC system V 3. 3 - 2 shows that this system is suitable for use in a forklift truck and that it not only meets the economic system requirements for commercialization but goes well beyond them...|$|E
