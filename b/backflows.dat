Results from physical modeling are commonly taken into account in volcanic hazard assessment and in the definition of hazard mitigation strategies. In this work, we modeled pyroclastic density currents in the Phlegrean Fields caldera, where flows propagating along the flat ground could be confined by the old crater rims that separate downtown Naples from the caldera. The different eruptive scenarios (mass eruption rates, magma compositions, and water contents) were based on available knowledge of this volcanic system, and appropriate vent conditions were calculated for each scenario. Simulations were performed along different topographic profiles to evaluate the effects of topographic barriers on flow propagation. Simulations highlighted interesting features associated with the presence of obstacles such as the development of <b>backflows.</b> Complex interaction between outward moving fronts and <b>backflows</b> can affect flow propagation; if <b>backflows</b> reach the vent, they can even interfere with fountain dynamics and induce a more collapsing behavior.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the interplay between}} jets from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and the surrounding InterStellar Medium (ISM) through full 3 D, high resolution, Adaptive Mesh Refinement simulations performed with the FLASH code. We follow the jet- ISM system for several Myr in its transition from an early, compact source to an extended one including a large cocoon. During the jet evolution, we identify three major evolutionary stages and we find that, contrary {{to the prediction of}} popular theoretical models, none of the simulations shows a self-similar behavior. We also follow the evolution of the energy budget, and find that the fraction of input power deposited into the ISM (the AGN coupling constant) is of order of a few percent during the first few Myr. This is in broad agreement with galaxy formation models employing AGN feedback. However, we find that in these early stages, this energy is deposited only in a small fraction (< 1 %) of the total ISM volume. Finally we demonstrate the relevance of <b>backflows</b> arising within the extended cocoon generated by a relativistic AGN jet within the ISM of its host galaxy, previously proposed as a mechanism for self-regulating the gas accretion onto the central object. These <b>backflows</b> tend later to be destabilized by the 3 D dynamics, rather than by hydrodynamic (Kelvin- Helmholtz) instabilities. Yet, in the first few hundred thousand years, <b>backflows</b> may create a central accretion region of significant extent, and convey there as much as a few millions of solar masses.

We have introduced a discrete equation and associated boundary conditions for an auxiliary variable. The algorithm contains constructions that prevent a numerical locking at the open/outflow boundary. In addition, we have also developed a scheme with a provable unconditional stability for a sub-class of the open boundary conditions. Extensive numerical experiments have been presented to demonstrate the performance of our method for several flow problems involving open/outflow boundaries. We compare simulation results with the experimental data to demonstrate the accuracy of our algorithm. Long-time simulations have been performed for a range of Reynolds numbers at which strong vortices or <b>backflows</b> occur at the open/outflow boundaries.

Close to the jet axis, a centrally-darkened counter-jet lies opposite a centrally-brightened jet, but both are surrounded by broader collimated emission that is brighter on the counter-jet side. We have adapted our previous models of FR I jets as relativistic outflows to include an added component of symmetric backflow. We find that the observed radio emission, after subtracting contributions from the extended lobes, is well described by models in which decelerating outflows with parameters similar to those derived for jets in plumed FR I sources are surrounded by <b>backflows</b> containing predominantly toroidal magnetic fields. These return to within a few kpc of the galaxies with velocities of roughly 0. 25 c and radiate with a synchrotron spectral index close to 0. 55.

40|$|We {{present a}} new energy-stable open {{boundary}} condition, and an associated numerical algorithm, for simulating incompressible flows with outflow/open boundaries. This open boundary condition ensures the energy {{stability of the}} system, even when strong vortices or <b>backflows</b> occur at the outflow boundary. Under certain situations it {{can be reduced to}} a form that can be analogized to the usual convective boundary condition. One prominent feature of this boundary condition is that it provides a control over the velocity on the outflow/open boundary. This is not available with the other energy-stable open boundary conditions from previous works. Our numerical algorithm treats the proposed open boundary condition based on a rotational velocity-correction type strategy. It gives rise to a Robin-type condition for the discrete pressure and a Robin-type condition for the discrete velocity on the outflow/open boundary, respectively at the pressure and the velocity sub-steps. We present extensive numerical experiments on a canonical wake flow and a jet flow in open domain to test the effectiveness and performance of the method developed herein. Simulation results are compared with the experimental data as well as with other previous simulations to demonstrate the accuracy of the current method. Long-time simulations are performed for a range of Reynolds numbers, at which strong vortices and <b>backflows</b> occur at the outflow/open boundaries. The results show that our method is effective in overcoming the backflow instability, and that it allows for the vortices to discharge from the domain in a fairly natural fashion even at high Reynolds numbers.
