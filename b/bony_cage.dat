In {{the body}} of the rabbit, as {{examined}} from the outside, we can make out by feeling two distinct regions, just as we might in {{the body of}} a man; anteriorily a <b>bony</b> <b>cage,</b> having the ribs at the sides, a rod-like bone in the front, the sternum (Figure 1 -st.-, [stm.]), and the backbone behind, and called the chest or thorax; and posteriorily a part called the abdomen, which has no bony protection over its belly, or ventral surface. These parts together with the neck constitute the trunk. As a consequence of these things, in the backbone of the rabbit there are four regions: the neck, or cervical part, consisting of seven vertebrae, the thoracic part of twelve joined to ribs, the abdominal (also called the lumbar) region of seven without ribs, and the tail or caudal of about fifteen. Between the lumbar and caudal come four vertebrae, the sacral, which tend to run together into a bony mass as the animal grows old, and which form a firm attachment for the base of the hind limb.|$|E
5000|$|Niven's works {{describe}} Bandersnatchi as {{one giant}} cell with long chromosomes {{as thick as}} a human finger, rendering them impervious to the mutagenitive effects of radiation and therefore unable to mutate. [...] As single cells, they reproduce asexually by budding. Their nerves have no cell body and no nuclei; nothing to separate them from other specialized protoplasm. The Bandersnatchi also have 6 large hearts, each weighing about 11 pounds. The brain is large, shaped long and narrow, and is encased in a <b>bony</b> <b>cage.</b> The skull is one end of this jointless, flexible, very strong cage that keeps them from ever shifting position.|$|E

The authors present {{a case of}} an 11 -year-old girl with typical features of Gorlin-Goltz syndrome with special respect to medical and dental problems which include multiple <b>bony</b> <b>cage</b> deformities like spina bifida with scoliosis having convexity to the left side, presence of an infantile uterus and multiple odonogenic keratocysts in the maxillofacial region...|$|E
40|$|Three {{and five}} millilitrc of india ink were {{injected}} bilaterally into the costal groove of the 9 th or 1 Oth ribs of 14 cadavers. The spread was observed and the costal groove of the nb injected was dissected, {{with the one}} above and one below. Nunnand Slavin's study (1980) of similar injections in two cadavers indicated that an injection of one costal groove blocked not only the intercostal nerve of that groove, {{but at least the}} one above and below it. The present study verified the author's previous report that only the intercostal nerve in the costal groove of the rib injected is anaesthetized. Two recent anatomical studies of block of the intercostal nerves have been published (Moore, Bush and Scurlock, 1980; Nunnand Slavin, 1980). Both studies used the same technique of injection and marker solution was injected into the costal grooves of the ribs of two cadavers. Nunn and Slavin (1980) removed the <b>bony</b> rib <b>cages</b> after postmortem, injected 3 ml of india ink at the 6 â€” 7 or the 8 - 9 intercostal space, visualized the spread...|$|R
30|$|Standard {{postoperative}} {{assessment of}} lumbar interbody fusion includes lateral flexion-extension radiographs to detect intervertebral motion. In patients with persistent or recurrent symptoms, thin (1 to 2 [*]mm)-sliced computed tomography (CT) with coronal and sagittal reconstructions {{to examine the}} presence of bridging bone has been advocated [4]. A CT scan can very well exclude a pseudarthrosis (negative predictive value of 100 %) [5], but the positive predictive value for pseudarthrosis is only 21 %, {{as compared to the}} gold standard of surgical re-exploration. Moreover, current imaging techniques, such as plain radiography and CT, cannot reliably assess bony fusion at an early stage. Only in case of complete trabecular bony bridging, ingrowth as a sign of complete segmental fusion can be confirmed which, in general, takes about a year to occur. In addition, the presence of intervertebral cages makes it harder to assess fusion reliably. So, in case <b>bony</b> ingrowth in <b>cages</b> has to be assessed, plain radiography and CT are not of clinical use in the early postoperative phase.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBody {{compartments}} {{bound by}} fascia and limited by bony backgrounds {{are found in}} the extremities, buttocks, abdomen and thoracic cavity; conditions that cause intracompartmental swelling and hypertension can lead to ischemia and limb loss. Although compartment syndromes are described in all body regions from head to toe, the etiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are best characterized for three key body regions: the first is extremity, the second is abdominal, and the third is thoracic compartment syndromes. Thoracic compartment syndrome usually occurs as a result of pathological accumulation of air, fluid or blood in the mediastinum and has traditionally been described in trauma. As the intracranial contents are confined within a rigid <b>bony</b> <b>cage,</b> any increase in volume within this compartment as a result of brain oedema or an expanding traumatic intracranial haematoma, leads to a reciprocal decrease in the volume of cerebrospinal fluid and intracranial venous blood volume. Limb compartment syndromes may present either in acute or chronic clinical forms. Intra-abdominal pressure can be measured by direct or indirect methods. While the direct methods are quite accurate, they are impractical and not feasible for routine practice. Indirect measurement is done through inferior vena cava, gastric, rectal and urinary bladder. Indirect measurement through urinary bladder is the simplest and is considered the method of choice for intra-abdominal pressure measurement. The management of patients with intra-abdominal hypertension is based on four important principles: the first is related to the specific procedures aiming at lowering intra-abdominal pressure and the consequences of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome; the second is for general support and medical management of the critically ill patient; while the third is surgical decompression and the fourth is optimization after surgical decompression...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{statistical}} profile {{reflects a}} global estimate of 5. 1 million deaths in 2000, which {{was due to}} injuries that accounted for 10 % of deaths due to all causes. Out of this, a quarter of injury-related deaths occurred in the South-East Asian region. Road Traffic Accident (RTA) is one among the top 5 causes {{of morbidity and mortality}} in South-East Asian countries. Most common cause of blunt abdominal trauma in India is road traffic accident followed by pedestrian accidents, abdominal blows, and fall from heights. Aims: To analyze the epidemiology and pattern of fatal thoraco-abdominal injuries in road traffic accidents. Materials and Methods: An autopsy-based cross-sectional study conducted. A purposive sampling technique was applied to select the study sample of 100 post-mortems of road traffic accident between November 2008 and May 2010 subjected to medico-legal autopsy at the department of Forensic Medicine, KIMS Hospital Bangalore. Results: The majority of the victims were aged 21 to 40 years, 50 (50. 0 %), most of the victims were male 92 (92. 0 %); and male/female ratio was 11. 5 : 1. Commonest offending agents in heavy motor vehicles were 54 (54. 0 %). <b>Bony</b> <b>cage</b> sustained injuries were observed in 71; out of this, fractures of ribs were observed in 45 (63. 3 %) victims, clavicle in 14 (19. 7 %), sternum was 6 (8. 4 %), and vertebrae 6 (8. 4 %) of fatal road traffic accidents. Internal thoracic injuries were observed in 26 cases. Among internal thoracic injuries, lungs were the most commonly involved organ 24 (92. 3 %) followed by the heart 2 (7. 6 %). Lung sustained more lacerations 19 (79. 1 %) than contusions 5 (20. 8 %). Internal abdominal injuries were observed in 49 cases. In road traffic accidents, the most commonly injured abdominal organs were solid organs such as liver 16 (32. 6 %) followed by spleen 9 (18. 3 %). Conclusions: Majority of the times in road traffic accidents, young and productive males were injured or lost their life. This study may help the planners to take safety measures, to implement strict traffic rules, to risk stratification in the susceptible population to educate the people, and the study of nature of offending agent in RTA can help the authorities to plan better availability of health care on roads...|$|E
