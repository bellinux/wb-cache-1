40|$|Fuzzy {{logic is}} a {{powerful}} method for mapping space input into space output. Between space input and output there is a black box for mapping input towards suitable output. Although many ways works with the black box, fuzzy logic will give powerful solution. The purpose of the research is looking for relation parameters between velocity and <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> of vehicle model that can be control to determine optimum brake distance of vehicle model by using rules base of fuzzy logic with verbose format. The step of research methodology are: determining space input variable of fuzzy logic i. e. : velocity and <b>brake</b> <b>pressure,</b> using fuzzy operator, using implication function, composing space fuzzy output of brake distance, and then processing of defuzzification. The result of this research has given optimum brake distance of model vehicle. Where as the maximum of velocity = 112 km/h and <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> (P <b>brake)</b> = 80 bars will give minimum brake distance = 24. 90 meters, if <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> &# 8804; 22. 8 bars will give maximum braking distance = 52. 30 meters. The conclusion is model vehicle with <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> 20 bars <P brake< 80 bars will give brake distance: 24. 90 meters< S brake< 52. 30 meters in working velocity...|$|R

5000|$|Electronic brakeforce {{distribution}} (EBD or EBFD) or electronic brakeforce limitation (EBL) is an automobile brake technology that automatically varies {{the amount of}} force applied to each of a vehicle's wheels, based on road conditions, speed, loading, etc. Always coupled with anti-lock braking systems (ABS), EBD can apply more or less <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> to each wheel {{in order to maximize}} stopping power whilst maintaining vehicular control. [...] Typically, the front end carries the most weight and EBD distributes less <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> to the rear brakes so the rear brakes do not lock up and cause a skid. In some systems, EBD distributes more <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> at the rear brakes during initial brake application before the effects of weight transfer become apparent.|$|R

50|$|In {{recent years}} {{locomotives}} {{have been fitted}} with emergency flashers {{on the roof of}} the cab, and these flashers are also activated when the <b>brake</b> pipe <b>pressure</b> is lost for any reason other than the driver's application of the brake valve. This alerts drivers of oncoming trains of the possibility of a derailed or parted rake which may foul other tracks (since <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> may have been lost for those reasons as well); at the locomotive, it is not possible to tell whether the loss of <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> is due to the pulling of the alarm chain.|$|R

50|$|Wheel speed {{transducers}} in each {{main wheel}} axle induce an AC frequency on the DC voltage input proportionate to the wheel speed as they are driven by the wheels. This frequency is compared to a normal deceleration curve and if it deviates it activates a small torque motor in the affected wheel control valve which shunts <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> to the return line {{by means of a}} spool valve. As the wheel rotation speed accelerates to normal tolerance limits, normal <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> is restored.|$|R
5000|$|The driver’s {{brake valve}} is self-lapping; the {{position}} of the valve activates a specific <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> in the <b>brake</b> cylinders and therefore a specific braking rate.|$|R

50|$|With {{a single}} rear CBS the <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> applied {{on the rear}} brake (pedal) is {{simultaneously}} distributed to the front wheel. A delay valve cuts the hydraulic pressure to assure that only when strong <b>braking</b> is applied, <b>pressure</b> is also created at the front wheel.

50|$|The stoppie is a {{motorcycle}} and bicycle trick {{in which the}} back wheel is lifted and the bike is ridden on the front wheel by carefully applying <b>brake</b> <b>pressure.</b> It is also sometimes called a front wheelie, or commonly endo.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that drivers use specific visual information to execute braking behaviors [Faj 05] and that drivers calibrate braking behavior to this visual information over time [Faj 09]. Specifically, Fajen (2005) argued that when successfully braking, participants adjust <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> to maintain a visually-specified ideal <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> less than one’s maximum ability to brake. In the current paper, we investigated whether factors, specifically one’s emotional state, would alter the relationship between braking behavior and visually-specified ideal <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> over time. Specifically, we investigated whether the performance of braking changed when anxious. Previous research demonstrated that anxiety influences static perceptual judgments of space [Gra 12] {{and the performance of}} open-loop sports actions [Bei 10]. Open-loop actions are actions where once the movement has been initiated there are no opportunities to alter the outcome (i. e., putting a golf ball). This research shows an influence of anxiety on static perceptual tasks and the performance of open-loop actions suggesting that anxiety may also influence more complex everyday actions like braking. It is important to know whether, and how, the influence of anxiety extends to the performance of closedloop actions like braking given the potential realworld consequences of poor performance...|$|R

50|$|Although less common, rolling burnouts can be {{achieved}} with modified line locks by proportionally increasing the front <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> and the throttle to keep the car at a steady speed. This makes the rear tires slip and spin faster than the front tires and burnout.|$|R
50|$|EBS still {{relies on}} {{compressed}} air for braking {{and is only}} controlling the air through valves which means {{that it is not}} depending on higher voltages used by the electromechanical or electrohydraulical brake systems where electric power also is used to apply the <b>brake</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|R
50|$|Following on {{from the}} Mercedes {{innovations}} ABS, ASR, ESP® and Brake Assist, this system is regarded as yet another important milestone to enhance driving safety. With Sensotronic Brake Control electric impulses are used to pass the driver’s braking commands onto a microcomputer which processes various sensor signals simultaneously and, depending on the particular driving situation, calculates the optimum <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> for each wheel. As a result, SBC offers even greater active safety than conventional brake systems when braking in a corner or on a slippery surface. A high-pressure reservoir and electronically controllable valves ensure that maximum <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> is available much sooner. Moreover, the system offers innovative additional functions to reduce the driver’s workload. These include Traffic Jam Assist, Soft-Stop.|$|R
50|$|The {{sole purpose}} of the VDC program is to prevent or {{minimise}} the risks of a potential accident. Up to ten computer systems monitor all four wheels {{in addition to the}} driver's steering, throttle and braking input, in real time. Should the VDC system detect a loss of traction, the ESC and TCS components automatically apply <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> and reduce engine speed to prevent oversteer or understeer, ensuring that the driver remains in control. Should the driver apply the brakes in an emergency, the ABS component prevents the wheels from locking up, while EBD assigns appropriate brake force to each wheel and BA increases <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> to bring the car to a safe and complete stop. The HHA component prevents the car from rolling backwards whilst on a hill, should the brake pedal be released.|$|R
25|$|Use of {{distributed}} power (i.e., {{remotely controlled}} locomotive units mid-train and/or {{at the rear}} end) mitigates somewhat the time-lag problem with long trains, because a telemetered radio signal from the engine operator in the front locomotive commands the distant units to initiate <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> reductions that propagate quickly through nearby cars.|$|R

40|$|Paper―based {{friction}} materials containing {{four different}} graphite particle sizes were prepared using the wet paper―making process. The effects of graphite particle size on friction performance such as friction torque curves, dynamic friction coefficient, static friction coefficient and wear rate were studied {{by using an}} inertia friction tester. Meanwhile, the sensitivity of friction coefficient to <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> and rotating speed was also investigated. Worn surfaces of samples were analyzed by using scanning electron microscope. The results show that with graphite particle size decreasing, braking time increases and torque curves become more stable, while friction coefficient and wear rate decrease. The dynamic friction coefficient declines as <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> and rotating speed increase. Samples with proper particle size exhibit more stable friction coefficient in the continuous braking process. Lubricating film is formed to lower wear rate in the worn surface as the graphite particles size decreases...|$|R

50|$|CBS {{helps to}} reduce the danger of wheel locks and fall downs but in certain {{situations}} {{it is possible that}} CBS causes a fall down. If <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> is distributed from the rear wheel to the front wheel and the friction of the surfaces changes suddenly (puddle, ice on the street) the front wheel might lock even if only the rear brake has been applied. This would lead to a loss of stability and a fall down. CBS is therefore combined with ABS to avoid this on a motorcycle.Different approaches are possible to realize this combination:Without active pressure Build upSingle Version: A third additional channel links the rear wheel circuit through a delay valve to the front <b>brake.</b> Strong <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> at the rear wheel (or both wheels) pressurises both brake circuits however this pressure is adjusted according to wheel speed and brake slip.|$|R
