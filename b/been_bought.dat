Everything else <b>is</b> <b>bought</b> and sold for Labour, but labour itself cannot <b>be</b> <b>bought</b> nor sold for anything, being priceless.[80] The {{idea that it}} is a commodity to <b>be</b> <b>bought</b> or sold, <b>is</b> the alpha and omega of Politico-Economic fallacy.|$|R

5|$|The Holmenkollen Line was {{the first}} light rail line, which opened in 1898 and ran west of the city. Later light rail lines in the west were the Røa Line (opened in 1912), the Lilleaker Line (1919), the Sognsvann Line (1934) and the Kolsås Line (1942). From 1928, they ran to the city centre via the Common Tunnel. East of the city, the Ekeberg Line opened in 1917, {{followed}} by the Østensjø Line (opened in 1926) and the Lambertseter Line (1957). The light rail lines were built by three private companies, Holmenkolbanen, Ekebergbanen and Bærumsbanen. By 1975, all had <b>been</b> <b>bought</b> by Oslo Sporveier.|$|E
5|$|The Union Church {{was formed}} in 1862, with John Rylands as its patron; he laid the {{foundation}} stone of its building in Edge Lane, close to Longford Park's southern entrance, in 1867. In {{the latter part of}} the 20th century the church was converted into office accommodation but by the early 21st century was standing empty.

5|$|Duc had {{years of}} {{experience}} in France, which had given him a good feel of how the French might be thinking and what their relations with Francophile members of the ARVN might resemble. He used this to concoct some plausible sounding and incriminating documents for Mậu. They purported to show that three prominent members of the junta: Generals Minh, Kim and Don had <b>been</b> <b>bought</b> by French agents and were on the brink of declaring South Vietnam's neutrality and signing a peace deal to end the war with the North. Some of the documents were leaked to elements of the American presence in Saigon and were {{brought to the attention of}} some senior American officials.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, {{the main}} {{customers}} for charter flights had been Norwegian shipping companies, who flew their crew home from ports in Central Europe. In 1959, Saga Tours was created {{as the first}} travel agency for Mediterranean charter trips, and the company started a cooperation with Braathens SAFE. The first DC-4 flew to Mallorca that year. In 1961, the company's first Douglas DC-6B was bought. It had a capacity of 96 passengers, and cooperation was also started with Metro and Paddan in Gothenburg. Other charter destinations were London, Alicante and Málaga, both in Spain. That year, Braathens SAFE bought 50% of Saga Tours in a private placement. Braathens SAFE established an office in Gothenburg in 1965. After Vingresor had <b>been</b> <b>bought</b> by SAS and moved to Stockholm three years later, three employees started Atlas Resor in Gothenburg, and started using Braathens SAFE as their airline. By 1966, Braathens SAFE was operating seven DC-6s.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{deregulation}} of the airline market in 1994, which allowed any European Economic Area-airline to operate any route they wished, Teddy Air tried to start services at Moss Airport, Rygge. Since {{it at the time}} was the military-only Rygge Air Station, with no passenger facilities, the airline was not successful in receiving permission. However, it did choose to start competing with Air Stord on the Skien–Bergen route, starting 8May 1995. Using its Embraer 110 aircraft, it launched tickets for under NOK1000, compared with the NOK1290 price offered by Air Stord. The latter had aircraft half the size, but offered 31 flights per week, compared to the 16 offered by Teddy Air. In addition, Coast Air launched two weekly round trips. The routes were mainly used by commuters working on offshore oil platforms in the North Sea. By 1995, 60 percent of the airline had <b>been</b> <b>bought</b> by Hermann Løvenskiold.|$|E

5|$|Having {{crossed into}} Europe in April 480 BC, the Persian army began its march to Greece. Five major food depots {{had been set}} up along the path: at White Headland on the Thracian side of the Hellespont, at Tyrodiza in Perinthian territory, at Doriskos at the Evros river estuary where the Asian army was linked up with the Balkan allies, at Eion on the Strymon river, and at Therme, modern-day Thessaloniki. There, food had been sent from Asia for several years in {{preparation}} for the campaign. Animals had <b>been</b> <b>bought</b> and fattened, while the local populations had, for several months, been ordered to grind the grains into flour. The Persian army took roughly three months to travel unopposed from the Hellespont to Therme, a journey of about 600km (360 mi). It paused at Doriskos where it was joined by the fleet. Xerxes reorganized the troops into tactical units replacing the national formations used earlier for the march.|$|E
5|$|He {{bought a}} 365-acre (148-hectare) 20-bedroom luxury estate in Rockwood, Surrey in 1995 through {{a chain of}} firms, trusts, and {{offshore}} companies in 1994. The country home's refurbishment abruptly ended in October 1996, shortly {{before the end of}} his wife's second term. He initially denied for eight years that he owned the property and no one paid the bills for the work on the unoccupied mansion. Creditors forced a liquidation sale in 2004 and the Pakistani government claimed the proceeds because the home had <b>been</b> <b>bought</b> with money obtained through corruption. However, he stepped in to claim that he actually was the beneficial owner. , the proceeds were in a liquidator bank account while a civil case continues.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, Connex Norge {{offered to}} {{purchase}} Timetoget from NSB, and start operations. However, by February, Connex had changed their mind, {{and no longer}} wanted to purchase the company. Terje Bulling admitted that Timetoget {{had a very good}} agreement for operating the Arendal Line, and that a fourth Y1 railcar had <b>been</b> <b>bought</b> from Sweden for this route. However, when NSB had tried to sell Timetoget, this agreement {{was not part of the}} estate. By April, NSB estimated that they had lost NOK10 million on their engagement in Timetoget. However, they had three Y1 trains, and would be able to start using them on the Bratsberg Line and the Arendal Line.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Oslo Sporveier was {{in need of}} new trams to operate on their network. Except for 40 {{articulated}} SL79-trams that had been delivered between 1982 and 1990, the company had several series of non-articulated trams with trailers that were built before 1960. The largest series were 13 SM53s, 11 rebuilt SM83s and 28 trailers, in addition to 34 SM91s that had <b>been</b> <b>bought</b> used from the Gothenburg Tramway in 1991. Oslo Sporveier considered several possibilities for new trams, including ordering additional SL79s, purchasing motorized trailers for SL79, purchasing new low-floor trams, purchasing trams from ČKD Tatra, purchasing the 11 used TT Class 8 trams from Trondheim, rebuild the SL79s with an additional section or purchasing used articulated trams from abroad. Purchasing used material and rebuilding the SL79s was quickly rejected. A non-articulated Tatra tram was tested in Oslo during January 1991.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in 1996 {{the games}} {{industry}} was rocked {{by the news}} that TSR had run into insoluble financial problems and had <b>been</b> <b>bought</b> by Wizards of the Coast. While WotC was busy refocussing TSR's products, Christopher Clark of Inner City Games Designs approached Gygax in 1997 {{to suggest that they}} produce some adventures to sell in game stores while TSR was otherwise occupied; the result was a pair of fantasy adventures published by Inner City Games: A Challenge of Arms (1998) and The Ritual of the Golden Eyes (1999). Gygax introduced some investors to Clark's publication setup, and although the investors were not willing to fund publication of Legendary Adventures, Clark and Gygax formed a partnership called Hekaforge Productions. Gygax was thus able to return to publish Lejendary Adventures in 1999. The game was published as a three-volume set: The Lejendary Rules for All Players (1999), Lejend Master's Lore (2000) and Beasts of Lejend (2000).|$|E
5|$|Nettlecombe {{has never}} <b>been</b> <b>bought</b> or sold. It was held before the Norman Conquest by Prince Godwine, son of King Harold. William the Conqueror assumed {{possession}} of Nettlecombe after defeating King Harold at the Battle of Hastings. In 1160, Henry II granted it to Hugh de Raleigh, {{and to his}} heirs in perpetuity. It passed to Warine de Raleigh, and on through direct blood heirs until the 19th century, a claim strengthened by marriages between deep ancestral cousins. The estate became a seat of the Trevelyan baronets (previously spelled as Trevilian), who also held another manor at Basil, by the marriage of Sir John Trevilian in 1481 to Lady Whalesborough, heiress of Nettlecombe via her Raleigh maternal line. Nettlecombe was held in continuity by Trevilian successors until the 20th century {{following the death of}} Joan Trevelyan and her husband Garnet Wolsey.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} marriage, Carrouges {{revealed}} another {{motive for the}} union. The valuable estate of Arnou-le-Faucon, given to his rival Jacques Le Gris two years earlier, had been formerly owned by Carrouges' father-in-law and had <b>been</b> <b>bought</b> by Count Pierre for 8,000 French livres in 1377. Carrouges immediately began a lawsuit to recover the land based on an assumed prior claim to it. The case dragged on for some months until ultimately Count Pierre was forced to visit his cousin King Charles VI to officially confirm his ownership {{of the land and}} his right to give it to whomever of his followers he chose. Despite losing the case, the lawsuit reflected very poorly on Carrouges at the court in Argentan and resulted in his further estrangement from Count Pierre's circle.|$|E
5|$|The {{stocks and}} sails were {{made during the}} two work-ins held in July and August, a total of 41 people {{attending}} over the two weeks. A second-hand stock had <b>been</b> <b>bought</b> in the 1920s and preserved at the mill, but upon examination it {{was found to be}} unfit for use. Thus two new stocks were required instead of one. Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds, leaving two options. Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber, or laminated stocks. Good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required. Douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds. A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only seven years. Thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made.|$|E
