5|$|Like the {{preceding}} Siegfried-class ships, Odin and Ägir were obsolete {{by the time}} World War I had started. Regardless, they were still used in their primary role until 1915, at which point they were withdrawn from active service. The ships performed a variety of secondary duties {{until the end of}} the war. On 17 June 1919, both ships were struck from the naval register and sold to the A. Bernstein Company in Hamburg. The shipping company had the ships rebuilt as freighters; Odin served in this capacity until she was scrapped in 1935, however Ägir accidentally grounded near the Karlsö lighthouse on the island of Gotland in 1929 and proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>total</b> loss.|$|E
5|$|On 4 May, Magdalena was {{declared}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>total</b> loss, making her the sixth ship built by Harland and Wolff {{to be lost}} on her maiden voyage. Her insurers paid out £2,295,000 to Royal Mail Lines by cheque on 16 May. At the time, this was the biggest payout for a marine casualty in the United Kingdom. It was decided that a replacement ship would not be built.|$|E

5|$|Continued poor weather drove New Carissa {{closer to}} the shore. Technical teams from two salvage contractors, Smit International and Salvage Master, had {{been working with the}} Coast Guard since February 5 and had drawn up plans to attempt to refloat the vessel, but when cracks in the hull and oil leaks were {{observed}} on February 8, any refloating attempts were precluded by the focus on preventing of a large-scale oil spill. In addition, Salvage Chief, upon her arrival, was unable to reach New Carissa with her tow gear. On February 10, New Carissa suffered major structural failure when the hull breached near the engine room, flooding the engines with seawater (and thus disabling them). The ship's insurers declared the vessel to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>total</b> loss. As a result, New Carissa was no longer a salvageable vessel; instead, she had effectively become a shipwreck.|$|E
5|$|Edgar Quinet {{continued}} her {{service in the}} eastern Mediterranean {{after the end of}} the war in 1918. During the culmination of the Greco-Turkish War that immediately followed World War I, Edgar Quinet rescued 1,200 people from the Great Fire of Smyrna in 1922. In 1925, Edgar Quinet was converted into a training ship. The work lasted until 1927, and included the reduction of her armament to ten of her 194mm guns, the removal of two of her funnels, and a reconstruction of her bridge. Then-Captain François Darlan commanded the ship in 1928. In 1929, Edgar Quinet underwent an overhaul; during this modernization she was fitted with equipment to handle floatplanes for reconnaissance purposes. After returning to service, the ship was assigned as a training ship for cadets from the École Navale (Naval Academy). On 4 January 1930, Edgar Quinet ran aground off the coast of Algeria west of Oran and proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>total</b> loss. She sank five days later.|$|E

25|$|The 1828 design {{originally}} {{filled the}} lock chamber {{through the use}} of culverts in the lock masonry. The wicket, i.e. large paddle valve, hidden in the masonry recess where the upper gate fit in, would be opened, and water would flow through the lock masonry to three openings in the lock chamber. Both sides of the lock had these, so there would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>total</b> of 2 wickets, and 6 openings. The upper gate is above the breast wall. Most of the wicket openings in the upper gate recess have been closed with masonry, but one wicket at Violettes Lock is still intact as of 2013 (see photo). Note that modern replacement gates in locks 1-23, have the wickets in the gates, since the original wickets in the lock masonry are inoperable. This system of routing water through the masonry was abandoned due the tendency for debris to clog the opening.|$|E
