40|$|In this study, Polyvinylidene {{fluoride}} (PVDF) {{hollow fiber}} hemodialysis membranes were prepared by non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) with compound addtive. The compound additive {{was made with}} polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and Poly ethylene glycol (PEG). The {{results showed that the}} modified PVDF membrane had better separation performance than virgin PVDF membrane. The UF flux of modified PVDF membrane can reach 684 L·h− 1 ·m− 2 and lysozyme (LZM) passage is 72. 6 % while virgin PVDF membrane is 313 L·h− 1 ·m− 2 and 53. 2 %. At the same time, the biocompatibility of PVDF membranes was also improved. Compared with commercial polysulfone hemodialysis membrane (Fresenius F 60 <b>S</b> <b>membrane),</b> the modified PVDF membrane had better mechanical and separation performance. The stress and tensile elongation of modified PVDF membrane was 0. 94 MPa and 352 % while Fresenius F 60 <b>S</b> <b>membrane</b> was 0. 79 MPa and 59 %. The LZM passage reached 72. 6 % while Fresenius F 60 <b>S</b> <b>membrane</b> was 54. 4 %. It was proven that the modified PVDF membrane showed better hydrophilicity, antithrombogenicity, less BSA adsorption, and lower hemolytic ratio and adhesion of platelets. Water contact angle and BSA adsorption of the modified PVDF membrane are 38 ° and 45 mg/m 2 while Fresenius F 60 <b>S</b> <b>membrane</b> are 64 ° and 235 mg/m 2. Prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of the modified PVDF membrane are 56. 5 s and 25. 8 s while Fresenius F 60 <b>S</b> <b>membrane</b> is 35. 7 s and 16. 6 s.

40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} the effects of X-linked and autosomal recessive Alport syndrome on retinal basement membranes and how these result in the characteristic perimacular dot-and-fleck retinopathy, lozenge, and macular hole. Methods. The type IV collagen chains present in the normal retina were determined immunohistochemically. Ten patients with Alport syndrome underwent retinal photography and optical coherence tomography to {{determine the}} thickness of the internal limiting membrane (ILM) by segmentation analysis, the layers affected by the retinopathy, and any correlates of the lozenge and macular hole. Bruch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>membrane</b> was examined directly by electron microscopy in a donated Alport eye. Results. The 345 type IV collagen network was present in the normal ILM and in the retinal pigment epithelium basement membrane of Bruch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>membrane.</b> In Alport syndrome, the ILM/nerve fiber layer and Bruch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>membrane</b> were both thinned. The dot-and-fleck retinopathy corresponded to hyperreflectivity of the ILM/nerve fiber layer in the distribution of the nerve fiber layer. The lozenge and macular hole corresponded to temporal macular thinning. The thinning across the whole retina was principally due to thinning of the ILM/nerve fiber layer and inner nuclear layer. Conclusions. The Alport dot-and-fleck retinopathy results primarily from abnormalities in the ILM/nerve fiber layer rather than in Bruch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>membrane.</b> Thinning of the ILM/nerve fiber layer contributes to the retinopathy, lozenge, and macular hole, possibly through interfering with nutrition of the overlying retina or clearance of metabolic by-products...|$|R

40|$|Retinal pigment {{epithelial}} (RPE) cells {{line the}} back of the eyeball between the retina and the choroid on Bruch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>membrane.</b> These cells provide nutrients to photoreceptors (i. e. rods and cones). Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) {{is the leading cause of}} vision loss in the developed world. This condition begins in early adult hood and progressively worsens as a person ages. AMD may occur when lipids build up in Bruch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>membrane,</b> preventing RPEs from providing nutrients to the photo receptors and causing RPE cell death as they cannot dispose of waste products. An in vitro model of RPE cells will allow scientists to study the effects of different stressful environments and how the cells respond. This presentation will discuss two areas of work done in the potential prevention and treatment of AMD. One of the two primary focuses of our research is examining how RPE cells respond to luminosity from handheld electronic devices in order to develop a correlation between luminosity and cell health. The data found from this research can help create a standard of production for technology that helps to limit the progression of AMD. The second pathway focuses on providing an ideal growth environment for RPE cells. These cells are normally hexagonal with close cell junctions and a deep pigment. This research will use spider silk proteins from Dr. Randy Lewis to simulate Bruch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>membrane.</b> These proteins are in an aqueous solution which is compatible with additives for enhancing correct cell growth. In addition, the thickness of the spider silk layer will be varied to examine the importance of physiological similarities between the actual and simulated Bruch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>membrane.</b> Success of this research could lead to a novel approach to pharmaceutical testing of AMD drugs wherein Bruch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>membrane</b> would not inhibit the transfer of medication to RPE cells...|$|R
