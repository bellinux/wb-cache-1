5000|$|One of {{the dangers}} {{inherent}} in slingshots is the high probability that the bands will fail. Most bands are made from latex, which degrades with time and use, causing the bands to eventually fail under load. [...] Failures at the pouch end are safest, as they result in the band rebounding away from the user. Failures at the fork end, however, send the band back towards the shooter's face, which can cause eye and facial injuries. [...] One method to minimize {{the chance of a}} fork end failure is to utilize a tapered band, thinner at the pouch end, and thicker and stronger at the fork end. [...] Designs that use loose parts at the fork are the most dangerous, as they can result in those parts being propelled back towards the shooter's face, such as the <b>ball</b> <b>attachment</b> used in the recalled Daisy [...] "Natural" [...] line of slingshots (see image). The band could slip out of the slot in which it rested, and the hard ball in the tube resulted in cases of blindness and broken teeth. Daisy models using plain tubular bands were not covered in the recall, because the elastic tubing does not cause severe injuries upon failure.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Wear of {{attachments}} {{leads to}} a loss of retention and potentially reduces the function of complete dentures. This study evaluated the retention force changes of different prefabricated attachment systems for implant-supported overdentures to estimate the wear constancy and applicability in clinical practice. METHODS: Four prefabricated attachment systems were tested [Group SG: retentive <b>ball</b> <b>attachment</b> (Straumann, Switzerland) with gold matrix, Group ST: retentive <b>ball</b> <b>attachment</b> (Straumann, Switzerland) with titanium spring matrix, Group IB: UNOR i-Ball with Ecco matrix (UNOR, Switzerland) and Group IMZ: IMZ-TwinPlus <b>ball</b> <b>attachment</b> with gold matrix (DENTSPLY Friadent, Germany) ]. Ten samples of each system were subjected to 10, 000 insertion-separation cycles. RESULTS: Results showed that all types of attachments showed wear, which led {{to a loss of}} retention force after an initial increase {{at the beginning of the}} wear simulation. Attachments with a plastic retention insert or gold matrices underwent the smallest changes in retention force. The titanium spring system showed the largest changes in retention force and a greater variation between the different cycles and specimen. This behaviour is probably caused by a large fitting tolerance of the titanium spring. CONCLUSIONS: Attachment systems which possess a male and female component of different material composition are preferable. They show smaller changes in the retention force.

40|$|Objective The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the retention force of an O-ring attachment system in different inclinations to the ideal path of insertion, using devices to compensate angulations. Material and methods Two implants were inserted into an aluminum base, and <b>ball</b> <b>attachments</b> were screwed to implants. Cylinders with O-rings were placed on <b>ball</b> <b>attachments</b> and connected to the test device using positioners to compensate implant angulations (0 degrees, 7 degrees, and 14 degrees). Plexiglass bases were used to simulate implant angulations. The base and the test device were positioned in a testing apparatus, which simulated insertion/removal of an overdenture. A total of 2900 cycles, simulating 2 years of overdenture use, were performed and 36 O-rings were tested. The force required for each cycle was recorded with computer software. Longitudinal sections of ball attachment-positioner-cylinder with O-rings of each angulation were obtained to analyze the relationship among them, and O-ring sections tested in each angulation were compared with an unused counterpart. A mixed linear model was used to analyze the data, and the comparison was performed by orthogonal contrasts (alpha= 0. 05). Results At 0 degrees, the retention force decreased significantly over time, and the retention force was significantly different in all comparisons, except from 12 to 18 months. When the implants were positioned at 7 degrees, the retention force was statistically different at 0 and 24 months. At 14 degrees, significant differences were found from 6 and 12 to 24 months. Conclusions Within the limitations of this study, it was concluded that O-rings for implant/attachments perpendicular to the occlusal plane were adequately retentive over the first year and that the retentive capacity of O-ring was affected by implant inclinations despite the proposed positioners.

40|$|Objectives Narrow-diameter {{implants}} (NDIs) {{are used}} in severely resorbed mandibles. The reduced implant diameter means {{a reduction in the}} total contact surface between the implant and bone. The question arises whether the implant can be sufficiently osseointegrated to withstand loading forces. If not, marginal bone loss can result from overload. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare clinical and radiographic measurements and patient satisfaction of NDIs with those of regular-diameter implants (RDIs) placed in edentulous patients to support an overdenture via either a ball or a locator connection. Material and Methods Retrospectively over a 7 -year period, a total 119 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were selected for this study. The patients received two 3. 3 - or 4. 1 -mm-diameter standard titanium implants in the mandible to support an overdenture. At maintenance examinations after 1 and 3 years, clinical peri-implant and prosthetic conditions, marginal bone (MB) and patient satisfaction were investigated. Results None of the 238 implants were lost during the 3 -year follow-up period. Overall MB loss was statistically higher in the NDI group when compared with the RDI group. At the site level, a greater MB loss was observed at the distal side of both implant types. Implants with a locator showed significantly greater MB loss (0. 38 mm) compared with the implants with a <b>ball</b> <b>attachment</b> (0. 14 mm) over the two-year evaluation period (P = 0. 006).

Clinical wear results in reduced retention of the prosthesis, requiring activation or renewal of the matrix to restore the initial level of retention. Purpose. The purpose of this retrospective study was to measure the wear of the matrix of a <b>ball</b> <b>attachment</b> after various periods of clinical wear. Material and methods. Seventy specimens of 3 groups of matrices of ball attachments {{that had been in}} use for mean periods of 12. 3 months (1 Y group, n= 26), 39. 0 months (3 Y group, n= 28) and 95. 6 months (8 Y group, n= 16) were retrieved from 35 patients (2 specimens per patient) and measured on a coordinate measuring machine equipped with a touch trigger probe. Ten unused matrices were used as controls (CTRL group). The external and internal matrix diameters and deviations from circularity were measured. For the various time periods, the decreases in matrix thickness were calculated and compared with controls. Kruskal-Wallis 1 -way ANOVA by ranks, followed by the Mann-Whitney post hoc tests, were conducted to test for differences in median values among groups (alpha=. 05). Results. For the internal upper diameter of the matrices tested, the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests revealed significant differences for the 3 groups compared to the controls. For group 1 Y, a significant difference (P<. 001) of the internal upper diameter was found compared to the CTRL group. Compared to the controls, the nonparametric analyses for groups 3 Y and 8 Y showed significant differences for the internal upper diameter (P<. 001) and deviations from circularity (P<. 001).

Therefore, to effectively improve the attachment shear strength, it is recommended to: (1) Use a larger solder pad; and (2) Minimize the misalignment between the sphere and the mounting solder pad. By implementing only the first recommendation into the current design, i. e., increasing the pad diameter from 0. 02 in. to 0. 03 in., the attachment shear strength could be improved b...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} stress patterns generated within implant-supported mandibular overdentures retained by two different attachment types: {{ball and socket}} and locator attachments. Materials and methods: Commercial CAD/CAM and finite element analysis software packages were utilized to construct two 3 D finite element models for the two attachment types. Unilateral masticatory compressive loads of 50, 100, and 150  N were applied vertically to the overdentures, parallel to the longitudinal axes of the implants. Loads were directed toward the central fossa in the molar region of each overdenture, that linear static analysis was carried out to find the generated stresses and deformation on {{each part of the}} studied model. Results: According to FEA results the <b>ball</b> <b>attachment</b> neck is highly stressed in comparison to the locator one. On the other hand mucosa and cortical bone received less stresses under ball and socket attachment. Conclusions: Locator and ball and socket attachments induce equivalent stresses on bone surrounding implants. Locator attachment performance was superior to that of the ball and socket attachment in the implants, nylon caps, and overdenture. Locator attachments are highly recommended and can increase the interval between successive maintenance sessions...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the effects of mucosal thickness on the stress pattern around implants and movement of implant-supported overdentures with ball/female and three different types of magnetic attachments. After insertion of two rootform implants into a mandibular model, the surface of the model was covered with a 1. 5 - or 3 -mm layer of impression material to simulate the oral mucosa, and removable overdentures were fabricated on each model. A 50 -N vertical force was applied to the right first molar, and the resultant stress distribution and denture movement were measured. In the 1. 5 -mm mucosal model, the magnetic attachments showed significantly lower bending moments than did the <b>ball</b> <b>attachment.</b> The denture base displacement was the lowest on a magnetic attachment. In this study, use of magnetic attachments could be advantageous for mandibular implant-supported overdentures based on lower stress and better denture stability especially in the thin mucosal model. 1...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the shear and tensile impact strength of solder <b>ball</b> <b>attachments.</b> Tests were conducted on Ni-doped and non-Ni-doped Sn– 0. 7 wt. % Cu, Sn– 37 wt. % Pb and Sn– 3. 0 wt. % Ag– 0. 7 wt. % Cu solder ball grid arrays (BGAs) placed on Cu substrates, which were as-reflowed and aged, {{over a wide range}} of displacement rates from 10 to 4000 mm/s in shear and from 1 to 400 mm/s in tensile tests. Ni additions to the Sn– 0. 7 wt. % Cu solders has slowed the growth of the interface intermetallic compounds (IMCs) and made the IMC layer morphology smooth. As-reflowed Ni-doped Sn– 0. 7 wt. % Cu BGA joints show superior properties at high speed shear and tensile impacts compared to the non-Ni-doped Sn– 0. 7 wt. % Cu and Sn– 3. 0 wt. % Ag– 0. 7 wt. % Cu BGAs. Sn– 3. 0 wt. % Ag– 0. 7 wt. % Cu BGAs exhibit the least resistance in both shear and tensile tests among the four compositions of solders, which may result from the cracks in the IMC layers introduced during the reflow processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{retrospective}} study was to evaluate the clinical performance of and patients' satisfaction with maxillary overdentures retained by splinted and unsplinted implants. Patients who had been treated with maxillary implant-retained overdentures because of functional problems with conventional complete dentures were identified and {{invited to participate in}} the study. A total of 16 patients fulfilled the enrollment criteria and agreed to participate. Eleven patients were treated with bar-retained overdentures with 3 to 6 clips (mean follow-up 32 months), and 5 patients wore overdentures retained by 2 to 6 <b>ball</b> <b>attachments</b> (mean follow-up 54 months). All subjects were satisfied with their prostheses, and most subjects experienced improvement in their oral function after treatment with implant-retained overdentures. At the time of clinical examination, 92 % (n = 77) of the 84 implants placed were functioning satisfactorily The cumulative survival rate for the implants after 72 months was 90 %. Loss of bone support correlated with peri-implant probing depth (r = 0. 29; P <. 02). No differences in mean bone loss between the subjects with ball-retained or bar-retained overdentures were found. The presence of plaque or peri-implant bleeding was not associated with the type of attachment...|$|R
40|$|A 61 -year-old female {{patient with}} adenoid cystic {{carcinoma}} (ACC) {{of the right}} maxilla and Angle class II division 1 malocclusion had received a subtotal maxillectomy in right side and used a conventional clasp-retained obturator. After implants placement, a maxillary interim immediate obturator (IIO) and then a definitive obturator using six endosseous implants were fabricated. During one-year follow-up, the patient was completely satisfied. Ideally, after implants placement in edentulous patients suffering from hemimaxillectomy, an implant-supported obturator (ISO) is designed {{in order to prevent}} nasal reflux and to improve speech and swallowing. However, in the following case, because of skeletal class II division 1 malocclusion and implants insertion in the premaxilla, using an ISO was impossible because it would cause excessive upper lip protrusion and lack of anterior teeth contact. Therefore, a five-unit implant-supported fixed partial denture (FPD) was fabricated in the maxillary anterior segment so that anterior teeth contacts were possible and the patient’s normal lip support was achieved. A bar and three <b>ball</b> <b>attachments</b> were used in the maxillary posterior segment. A closed-hollow-bulb ISO was preferred. Conventional ISO in these patients results in several problems. Using a maxillary anterior FPD along with ISO caused satisfactory results in the current patient...|$|R
