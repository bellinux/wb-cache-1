Backward and forward tape read and write operations were possible on the UNIVAC and were fully overlapped with instruction execution, permitting high system throughput in typical sort/merge data processing applications. Large volumes of data could be submitted as input via magnetic tapes created on offline card to tape system and made as output via a separate offline tape to printer system. The operators console had three columns of decimal coded switches that allowed any of the 1000 memory locations to be displayed on the oscilloscope.

Image quantization was done by employing the error-diffusion algorithm. The diffusion of error was performed in CMYK color space.

To evaluate the perceived image quality, a psychophysical experiment was conducted followed by a statistical analysis of the experimental data. Based on the results of this analysis, the conclusions on the tradeoffs between the number of quantization levels and spatial addressability were drawn.
