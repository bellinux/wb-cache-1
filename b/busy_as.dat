5|$|She {{was devastated}} by her husband's death and retired to Scotland. However, {{after a meeting}} with the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, she broke her {{retirement}} and resumed her public duties. Eventually she became just as <b>busy</b> <b>as</b> queen mother as she had been as queen consort. In July 1953, she undertook her first overseas visit since the funeral when she visited the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland with Princess Margaret. She laid the foundation stone of the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland – the current University of Zimbabwe.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this period that Marquis became {{interested}} in the Battle of the Little Bighorn and the death of Custer. This interest became an obsession that was to last the rest of his life. The battle site was only twenty-five miles to the west on the Crow Indian Reservation. All the participants of the battle on the US side had died in action, but very little had been published in the way of Indian accounts. Most information had come from soldiers who only witnessed the aftermath. Marquis realized that {{there were a number of}} Cheyenne participants of the battle still alive on the reservation. However, interviewing them at length seemed too difficult at this time. There was the language barrier, and Marquis was <b>busy</b> <b>as</b> a doctor trying to cover a large area.|$|E
5|$|On October 25, 1788 Jones' team {{began their}} survey of Grimsby Township; it was {{completed}} November 13, 1788. Saltfleet Township was surveyed from November 14, 1788 to December 25, 1788 and Binbrook Township was surveyed from December 24, 1788 until February 12, 1789. All of these townships were surveyed using the Front and Rear system, except Binbrook, which was surveyed with the Single Front system. During this time, Frey had assigned two other surveyors to lead surveys in the Nassau district. Daniel Hazen and Jesse Pawling both led teams, but neither group was as <b>busy</b> <b>as</b> Jones' group. Hazen's group surveyed only four townships, and incompletely, and Pawling's three, also incompletely. In November 1789 Jones began {{acting as the}} deputy surveyor in Nassau District as Frey had left Upper Canada, and he officially received the position in early 1791 {{on the order of}} Deputy Surveyor General John Collins.|$|E

5|$|The first, iconic uniforms the Raptors wore back in 1995 were {{extraordinarily}} <b>busy,</b> <b>as</b> they featured {{black and}} white tears as pin stripes, edgy asymmetric lettering, a raptor claw {{on one side of}} the shorts, a raptor biting the ‘T’ of the ‘TR’ franchise acronym on the other side, and were rounded up with a giant, aggressive-looking raptor dribbling a basketball (as depicted on the franchise logo) in the middle of the jersey. The Raptors unveiled new jerseys in 1999−00, launching a unique road jersey which had a purple front and a black back. In 2003−04, the Raptors introduced a solid red alternate that would become the main road jersey in 2006−07 onward, as purple was dropped from the team's colour scheme. From 2008−09 through 2014−15, the Raptors unveiled their alternate black road uniforms, which were actually worn as often as the primary red ones.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} 1827–40, Mary Shelley was <b>busy</b> <b>as</b> an editor and writer. She wrote the novels The Fortunes of Perkin Warbeck (1830), Lodore (1835), and Falkner (1837). She contributed five volumes of Lives of Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and French authors to Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia. She also wrote stories for ladies' magazines. She was still helping {{to support her}} father, and they looked out for {{publishers}} for each other. In 1830, she sold the copyright for a new edition of Frankenstein for £60 to Henry Colburn and Richard Bentley for their new Standard Novels series. After her father's death in 1836 {{at the age of}} eighty, she began assembling his letters and a memoir for publication, as he had requested in his will; but after two years of work, she abandoned the project. Throughout this period, she also championed Percy Shelley's poetry, promoting its publication and quoting it in her writing. By 1837, Percy's works were well-known and increasingly admired. In the summer of 1838 Edward Moxon, the publisher of Tennyson and the son-in-law of Charles Lamb, proposed publishing a collected works of Percy Shelley. Mary was paid £500 to edit the Poetical Works (1838), which Sir Timothy insisted should not include a biography. Mary found a way {{to tell the story of}} Percy's life, nonetheless: she included extensive biographical notes about the poems.|$|E

25|$|Many U.S. {{law schools}} teach legal {{writing in a}} way that {{acknowledges}} the technical complexity inherent in law and the justified formality that complexity often requires, but with an emphasis on clarity, simplicity, and directness. Yet many practicing lawyers, <b>busy</b> <b>as</b> they are with deadlines and heavy workloads, often resort to a template-based, outdated, hyperformal writing style in both analytical and transactional documents. This is understandable, but it sometimes unfortunately perpetuates an unnecessarily formal legal writing style.|$|E

25|$|By 1855, {{the gold}} rush was over and Westervelt, like other shipbuilders, began looking for new markets to keep his yard <b>busy,</b> <b>as</b> the {{shipping}} lines that had carried almost 2.7million emigrants across the Atlantic by sailing vessels between 1846–1855,were ordering fewer ships than before. The declining trend continued because of {{the outbreak of the}} Civil War in 1861.

Running back Fred Russell returned from a hand injury, and ran for 100 yards in becoming Iowa's 10th player to have a 1,000-yard rushing season. Iowa's victory tied a school record for wins in a season at 10.|$|E
25|$|By 1820, Hobart Town {{had grown}} to {{accommodate}} over 10,000 people, and had become an important Pacific base for the Royal Navy. The plentiful natural resources of the island also proved useful for the Royal Navy, who had soon turned Hobart into a thriving port. The docks were <b>busy</b> <b>as</b> the Navy shipped materials such as timber, flax and rum from Hobart Town. By this time {{it had become a}} vital Southern ocean re-supply stop for international shipping and trade, and therefore a major freight hub for the British Empire. Wealth poured into the port on the back of this trade, and in 1823 the Van Diemen's Land Bank, the first in the colony, began operations.|$|E

50|$|SNCF, one of Air Inter's {{two largest}} public sector shareholders, {{was also the}} company's main {{competitor}} on domestic trunk routes inside France. This intensified when SNCF began high-speed, high-frequency Train à Grande Vitesse (TGV) services on purpose-built tracks from 1981. The launch of TGV services between Paris and Lyon, one of Air Inter's <b>busiest</b> <b>as</b> well as shortest routes, in 1981 led {{to a reduction in}} frequency and smaller aircraft on Air Inter's competing service.|$|R
50|$|The large {{car park}} (to the south) and {{industrial}} estate (to the north) were originally large goods sidings.

25|$|The Grand Union Canal was nationalised in 1948, control {{transferring}} to the British Transport Commission, and in 1962 to the British Waterways Board, later British Waterways. Commercial traffic continued to decline, effectively ceasing in the 1970s, though lime juice was carried from Brentford to Boxmoor until 1981, and aggregates on the River Soar until 1996. However, leisure traffic took over, and the canal is now as <b>busy</b> <b>as</b> it ever was, with leisure boating complemented by fishing, towpath walking and gongoozling. More recently freight traffic has {{returned with the}} carriage of aggregates from Denham to West Drayton in barges and narrow boats, {{and the opening of}} a new wharf for re-cyclables and aggregates at Old Oak Common.|$|E
