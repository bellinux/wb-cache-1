40|$|The {{production}} of ventilated <b>barn</b> <b>hay</b> {{results in a}} high quality fodder for ruminants. Nevertheless, this production method is still a niche in Germany even it is found in organic farming. Reasons are the few publications about required investments of the needed technology for <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> in the <b>barn.</b> This article provides investment and energy costs for different drying techniques: for box <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> three different farm sizes were compared, for bale <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> only one farm size is calculated. Bale <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> demands more power and investment cost as box <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> of loose <b>hay.</b> Bale <b>drying</b> {{is more complicated than}} barn drying in that the number of bale drying locations in a barn is a limiting factor to throughput, as is also the drying of densely packed bales. Barn drying is above all practical on farms where hay is the only forage on offer. Its particular advantage is the large amounts of crop that can be dried at the same time. Bale drying tends to be applied more on farms that want their forage partly as grass silage and partly as barn-dried hay...|$|R

Authors conducted a study to enable farmers to prepare good hay economically, with as little labor as possible even during the rainy season. Methods: Italian ryegrass (before heading) was cut with a mower on a fine morning, dried under the sun until the evening, carried into a vinyl house (32 m^ 2) and further dried {{for two to three}} days in the house either on the floor or on a wire <b>hay</b> rack.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the dehydration curve and occurrence of fungi and mycotoxins in Tifton 85 hay. The experimental design was randomized blocks in split plots with four replications and five levels of nitrogen (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 kg ha- 1) in the form of urea, two regrowth ages (28 and 35 days) and <b>drying</b> <b>hay</b> in the sun and in shed. After harvesting, the grass was sampled four times (0, 8, 23 and 32 hours) to dry in the sun and twelve times (0, 3, 18, 27, 42, 51, 66, 75, 90, 99, 114 and 123 hours) for drying in shed, turned over daily. The fungi were identified after seeding and growth in three steps of haymaking (cutting, baling and after 30 days of storage). To verify the presence of mycotoxins, 20 samples, composed of hay stored for 30 days, were collected, of which 10 samples were from sun-dried hay and 10 from <b>hay</b> <b>dried</b> in shed. It took 32 hours to produce hay at field conditions, with water loss rates up to 6. 10 g g- 1 DM-h during the first 8 hours after cutting. The average loss of water in this period was 2. 0 g g- 1 DM-h. <b>Hays</b> <b>dried</b> in the shed took 123 hours and the dehydration rates were less than 0. 5 g g- 1 DM-h due to environmental conditions. There was a predominance of three genera of fungi: Fusarium, Penicillium and Aspergillus. The largest population was the Fusarium, followed by Penicillium, at the steps of baling and storage. The fumonisin mycotoxin was found at a higher concentration and there was no difference in fumonisin concentration in the <b>hay</b> <b>dried</b> in the sun and in shed. Although it brings no hazard to animal health, the production of aflatoxin and zearalenone was significantly higher in the samples of sun-dried hay...|$|R
