5|$|Leucangium carthusianum, the Oregon <b>black</b> <b>truffle,</b> {{is roughly}} similar in appearance, habitat, and growing season, {{but can be}} {{distinguished}} by its darker (charcoal black) peridium. Microscopically, the spores of Leucangium are larger (60–90μm) and have a single large oil droplet. L.carthusianum is also edible and prized for its taste and aroma.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically in 2010, based on specimens collected in February, 2009 from Benton County, Oregon. Before this, {{it had been}} known locally for several years as the Oregon brown truffle, and assumed to be an undescribed species of Leucangium, based on its overall resemblance to and similar habitat as the Oregon <b>black</b> <b>truffle,</b> Leucangium carthusianum; it was given the provisional name Leucangium brunneum. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences revealed that the species {{is not related to}} the truffle genera of the family Tuberaceae, including Tuber, Dingleya and Reddellomyces. Rather, it has close affinity with the hypogeous (below the soil surface) genera of the Morchellaceae, including Fischerula, Imaia, and Leucangium, but both genetic and morphological characters are sufficiently distinct to warrant designation as a distinct genus. All four hypogeous Morchellaceae genera produce huge spores, with sizes ranging from 32 to 100micrometers (μm). Both Kalapuya and Imaia have asci (spore-bearing cells) that have thick cell walls when young, but become thin when mature—a trait not shared with Fischerula. The authors explain that although the hypogeous Morchellaceae genera share the trait of large spore size, striking differences in spore structure and other morphological difference in microscopic characters would have ruled out placing them in the same family as Morchella, {{were it not for the}} convincing molecular evidence proving their relatedness.|$|E

50|$|In cooking, <b>black</b> <b>truffles</b> {{are used}} to refine the taste of meat, fish, soups and risotto. Unlike white truffles, the aroma of <b>black</b> <b>truffles</b> does not {{diminish}} when they are heated, but becomes more intense.|$|R

50|$|Boars and {{the larvae}} of the truffle fly (Suillia tuberiperda), which eat the fruiting bodies, {{aid in the}} {{distribution}} of the species by excreting the indigestible spores. Their excrement likely also serves to fertilize the spores. <b>Black</b> <b>truffles</b> are sometimes found together with winter truffles, which aid the growth of <b>black</b> <b>truffles</b> in wet soils.|$|R

500|$|The [...] "culinary jewel" [...] of the Augustus Tower is the Restaurant Guy Savoy, namesake of the three-star Michelin chef, whose {{restaurant}} in Paris has been ranked {{as one of}} the finest dining establishments in the world. When Savoy was approached to open a second {{restaurant in}} Vegas, he initially said no, until Caesars told him they wanted him to recreate what he had done in Paris with the same ambiance, quality and cuisine. His request was that to maintain quality, the restaurant must be limited to service five days a week, to which the management agreed. The restaurant opened in 2006 and in 2008, Savoy brought his executive chef from the Paris restaurant to Vegas. The establishment is managed by Savoy's son, Franck Savoy. The menu features signature dishes including artichoke and <b>black</b> <b>truffle</b> soup; buttered, roasted veal sweetbreads; crispy sea bass; and pan-seared quail, as main courses and dessert of chocolate ganache served with tonka beans. The wine cellar features 15,000 bottles from which to select and it is the only Champagne Krug Chef's Table restaurant in the United States.|$|E

About 80% of the French production comes from southeast France: upper Provence (départements of Vaucluse and Alpes-de-Haute-Provence), part of Dauphiné (département of Drôme), and part of Languedoc (département of Gard). 20% of the production comes from southwest France: Quercy (département of Lot) and Périgord. The largest truffle market in France (and probably also in the world) is at Richerenches in Vaucluse. The largest truffle market in southwest France is at Lalbenque in Quercy.

40|$|Truffles {{are among}} the most {{expensive}} foods and their quality depends on their unique aroma, composed of complex mixtures of lipophilic volatile organic compounds (VOCs). There are many foods flavored with truffle, and oils are particularly common. Using DHS–GC–MS and an electronic nose (MOS), 18 samples of olive oil flavored with white and <b>black</b> <b>truffles</b> from the Italian market were subjected to a blind analysis. Qualitative and quantitative analysis with DHS–GC–MS detected the presence of 63 VOCs, 32 of which can be attributed to olive oil, also defective, and 19 to truffles, while 12 foreign compounds are of dubious origin (synthesis and/or demolition). The data obtained with the electronic nose (MOS), processed statistically, was able to discriminate the aromas coincident with the three species of truffle declared on the label (the white truffle Tuber magnatum and the <b>black</b> <b>truffles</b> Tuber melanosporum and Tuber aestivum), demonstrating the potential and reliability of this technique, confirming the established malpractice of the use of bismethyl(dithio) methane in <b>black</b> <b>truffles</b> flavoring...|$|R
