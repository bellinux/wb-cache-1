The stimulus consisted of {{an array of}} 5 × 8 squares separated by two-dimensional noise borders of varying width. The squares were filled with vertical black or white stripes of random width. The task was to detect {{the presence of a}} target square which differed from the squares above and below in one of three possible ways: the target pattern was either a contrast inverted copy or a horizontal translation of the pattern in the vertically adjacent squares, or else an independent realization of the noise. The binary noise in the textures was sequentially high-pass filtered to preclude the use of coarse-scale receptive fields and minimize the presence of sparse, extended 2 ̆ 2 features 2 ̆ 2.

The {{solution to the}} diffusivity equation can be obtained using dimensionless transformation, Laplace transformation, Fourier cosine transformation and other mathematical methods.

The effect of parameters including fracture orientation, fracture length, the degree of penetration, reservoir boundary anisotropy, reservoir boundary conditions and reservoir width on the pressure and pressure derivative was fully investigated in detail.

40|$|Abstract—Fiducial {{images are}} a common method for {{supporting}} vision-based tracking in augmented reality systems. This paper addresses the question: {{what is the best}} fiducial? A set of criteria that are desirable in an optically tracked fiducial are presented and a new fiducial image set is designed that meets these criteria. The images in this set utilize a square blackborder pattern with a 15 % <b>border</b> <b>width</b> and an interior image that supports orientation determination and unique identification. The interior image is constructed from orthogonal DCT basis images chosen to minimize the probability of misidentification and to be robust to noise and occlusion. We describe how this image can be integrated into an AR software system such as ARToolKit. The most relevant examples to this conference are the ARToolKit markers, square fiducial images with a fixed, black band exterior surrounding a unique image interior [1]. Figure 1 is an example ARToolKit fiducial. The outer black band allows for location of a candidate fiducial in a captured image and the interior image allows for identification of the candidate from a set of expected images. The four corners of the located fiducial allow for the unambiguous determination of the position and orientation of the fiducial relative to a calibrated camera...|$|E

40|$|Utilizing {{magnetic}} {{principles in}} biological immunoassays {{is an attractive}} option given its ability to remotely and non-invasively manipulate and detect cells tagged with micro/nano size superparamagnetic type beads and {{due to the fact}} that even the most complex biological immunoassays will have very little magnetic effect. The presence of magnetic beads can be detected by a magnetic sensor which quantifies the amount of target cells present in the immunoassay. In order to increase the detection rate a circular conducting micro-trap is employed to attract, trap and transport the magnetic beads to the sensing area. In this research we propose a half-ring spin valve type giant magnetoresistance (GMR) sensor for the measurement of stray fields produced by 2 μm magnetic beads which are around the circular micro-trap. A couple of half-ring GMR sensors can be used to cover the entire circular <b>border</b> <b>width,</b> in order to detect the majority of the immobilized magnetic beads. Analytical and numerical analysis leading towards the fabrication of the half-ring GMR sensor are presented. DC characterization of the fabricated sensor showed a magnetoresistance of 5. 9 %.

Hence, half-ring GMR sensors integrated with a circular micro-trap have great potential to be used as an effective disease diagnostic device. © 2011 IEEE...|$|E

S. -Mexican relative prices and find that it is nearly {{an order of magnitude}} larger than for U. S. -Canadian prices. However, during a very stable sub-period in Mexico (May 1988 to November 1994), the "width" of the U. S. -Mexican border falls dramatically and becomes approximately equal to the U. S. -Canadian border. We then show that when consideration is limited to cities lying geographically very close to the U. S. -Mexican border [...] San Diego, Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, Tijuana, Mexicali, Juarez, and Matamoros [...] the <b>border</b> <b>width</b> falls compared to that estimated with the full sample of U. S. and Mexican cities, but falls only very slightly. We also present evidence that the border effect in U. S. -Mexican prices is not primarily due to the border effect in U. S. -Mexican wages. Finally, using the prices of 276 highly dis-aggregated goods and services, we estimate the variability of relative prices of different items within Mexican cities. This measure of relative price variability declines during the stable peso sub-period, but by less than the decline in nominal and real (i. e., CPI-based) exchange rate variability. Our results are strong evidence of a "nominal border effect" in relative prices within NAFTA, but also indicate that real side influences are important.

The features of the cuticle are commonly well preserved in the fossil record. Although the epidermal patterns of the examined taxa were similar, qualitative differences were seen in the subsidiary and guard cells. P. sylvestris showed small subsidiary cells homogenously arranged around {{the opening of the}} epistomatal chamber, while P. uncinata showed small, lateral subsidiary cells and non-differentiated subsidiary cells in the polar position. The aperture of the epistomatic chamber of P. uncinata was also larger in diameter (15. 1 ± 1. 8 µm P. sylvestris; 21. 1 ± 2. 8 µm P. uncinata). Principal components analysis and discriminant analysis was performed on the features of the guard cells characterising {{the size and shape of}} the cuticular thickenings — all the variables analysed can be measured in disperse stomata in microscope preparations for pollen analysis. Significant differences were found in the upper woody lamellae width and the coefficient associated with the shape of the medial lamellae borders (discriminant analysis weighting 0. 739 and 0. 826 respectively). Other significant parameters included the coefficient associated with the relative size of the medial lamellae <b>border</b> <b>width</b> of the guard cells with respect to the distance between the external limits of the medial lamellae borders, and the length of the upper woody lamella.

The {{aim of this study}} is to construct a pattern of reference for dimensions and proportions of the lips and establish parameters that may help estimate the vermilion borders' height dimensions and the mouth's width. By means of cone beam computed tomography, divided into two samples: sample 1 (n = 322; 137 male, 185 female) verified the linear distances delimited by anatomical landmarks in soft tissue. The sample 2 (n = 108; 40 male, 68 female), verified the proportions among the height of the vermilion <b>borders,</b> <b>width</b> of the mouth, and linear distances between craniometric landmarks in hard tissues, both from a Brazilian database. The measurements were completed using OsiriX, and the results were analyzed by means of descriptive statistics at a level of significance of 5 %. The height of the vermilion borders corresponded to approximately 26 % of the width of the mouth. The width of the mouth increased over the course of time in men and remained stable in women. In men, a mean intercanine distance of 75 % of the total mouth's width was found; for women, it was 80 %. The parameters of the relations between soft and hard tissues in the oral cavity region presented that the distance between landmarks ID-SM (Infradentale-Supramentale) corresponded to 55 % of the height of the vermilion borders of the mouth for both sexes, while the distance between landmarks PM-SD (Philtrum medium-Supradentale) corresponded to 85 % in men and 88 % in women. Mean values of 97 % of the width of the mouth in women and 93 % in men were attributed to the distance between the mentonian foramina.

Results are obtained using anisotropic conductivities based on experimentally derived data. The model is then altered, to include heterogeneous conductivities in the ischaemic region and larger <b>border</b> zone <b>widths,</b> {{in order to better}} reproduce realistic scenarios. Initial results for the rectangular and cylindrical ischaemic shapes show a central depression over the ischaemic region, for low ischaemic thicknesses, which separates into three depressions as the ischaemic thickness increases. For ischaemic thicknesses above 70 % an elevation appears over the ischaemic region and this increases in magnitude as the ischaemia becomes transmural. Results for the semi-ellipsoidal shape, however, differ, with the central depression separating into only two depressions as the thickness increases. Changing the conductivity inside the ischaemic region significantly affects results for each geometry, with depression staying over the ischaemic region for much higher levels of ischaemia (up to 90 % thickness). Increasing the intramural border zone thickness did not significantly affect the epicardial potential distributions. Griffith Sciences, School of Natural SciencesFull Tex...|$|R
40|$|Various {{programs}} have emerged that provide {{statistical analysis of}} World Wide Web (WWW) access logs. These programs typically detail the number of accesses for a file, {{the number of times}} a site has visited the database, and some programs even provide temporal analysis of requests. However, these programs are not interactive nor do they provide visualizations of the local database. WebViz was developed with the intention of providing WWW database maintainers and designers with a graphical view of their local database and access patterns. That is, by incorporating the Web-Path paradigm into interactive software, users can see not only the documents (represented visually as nodes) in their database, but also the hyperlinks travelled (represented visually as links) by users requesting documents from the database. WebViz further enables uses to selectively filter the access log (i. e. restrict the graphical view by specifying the desired domain names or DSN numbers, directory names, and start and stop times), control bindings to graph attributes (i. e. node size, <b>border</b> <b>width</b> and color as well as link width and color can be bound to frequency and recency information), play back the events in the access log(i. e. reissue the logged sequence of requests), select a layout of nodes and links that best presents the database's structure, and examine the graph at any instant in time. Clearly, WebViz is a useful WWW database utility given that it can provide the user with graphical information about document accesses and the paths taken by users through the database. Such analyses can facilitate structural and contextual changes resulting in a more efficient use of the document space.

40|$|This is {{the first}} {{rigorous}} morphometric analysis of Recent and fossil cetacean limb bones. The morphometric techniques of allometry and eigenshape analysis are used to examine shape change in the humerus, radius and ulna. In both studies, the limb bones of delphinids are morphologically distinct. Because bone morphology {{is a result of}} both genetic potential (phylogeny) and loading history (function), the bone morphology of delphinids reflects a unique phylogeny and/or function. The extinct Miocene Kentriodontidae are basal delphinoids, and are examined in further anatomic and functional detail. ^ Allometry is used to investigate both bone proportions of the humerus, radius, and ulna, and bone proportions versus body mass. The predicted model of geometric similarity, or isometry, does not explain all of the scaling relationships. Bone proportions of the radius and ulna exhibit negative allometry. Relative to geometric similarity, these bones are either underbuilt in large cetaceans or are overbuilt in small cetaceans. The fast relative swimming speeds of most delphinids may be responsible for these bones being more robust. The layer of mixed adipose and dense connective tissue may act as a replacement for bone tissue. ^ Eigenshape analysis of Recent and fossil cetacean humeri is used to characterize shape variation. Humeral morphotypes are described based on curvature of the caudal <b>border,</b> midshaft <b>width,</b> development and position of the deltopectoral crest, and degree of expansion of the epicondylar region. Recent and fossil delphinids and phocoenids form a morphofunctional group, sharing a similar humeral morphotype as well as similar flipper morphology. ^ Current knowledge of the diversity of the Kentriodontidae is increased by the description of a new genus and by description of the skull and postcrania of a poorly known genus. Hadrodelphis calvertense is a large lophocetine kentriodontid, while Macrokentriodon morani (n. gen., n. sp.) is the largest taxon referred to the Kentriodontinae.

Content of iron in the layer of 0 – 50 cm is determined. Obtained data is imported into QuantumGis and plotted on the map of the tilled soil of Ukraine. The centers of the clusters of studied objects are detected in the Central and Eastern parts of the steppe. Analysis of the causes revealed a complex of factors. For the year of observations it was revealed that the area of each ravine grew on average by 5 m², height by 8 cm, length by 24 cm, width by 21 cm, and concentration of Fe decreased by 20 mg/kg. The main reasons are significant precipitation and sustainable grass cover. Size of the gullies increased by 1 m², height – by 4 cm, length by 14 cm, width by 9 cm, concentration of Fe remained unchanged. Due to the fact that woody plants hinder the development of erosion and enrich the soil minerals, ravines feature the decrease in height by 1 cmand the concentration of Fe increase at 24  mg/kg, with the values of other indicators unchanged.

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} examine the effects of {{different}} numbers of presences and frequencies (proportions) of occurrences of species in a plot data set of forest vegetation on the species response curves and their niche attributes, based on Huisman-Olff-Fresco models (HOF). We modeled responses of 72 to 105 herbaceous forest species along a pH gradient under 14 different random sampling scenarios by varying the number of presences and absences used for model fitting. Mean niche attributes were calculated from 100 repetitive runs for each scenario and species. Re-prediction success of HOF models among the repetitive runs was highest when the total number of plots was high and the frequency of occurrences was low. With low plot numbers and high frequencies, less complicated model types (no response or monotonically increasing/decreasing responses) predominate. Measures of species niche boundaries (limits & <b>borders)</b> and niche <b>width</b> were strongly influenced by changes in sampling characteristics. With an increasing number of presences and an increasing frequency, limits and borders shifted to more extreme values, leading to wider niches. In contrast, species optima showed almost no change between the scenarios. Thus, the detected ecological response of a species often depends on the size of the data set and the relation between presences and absences of a species. In general, high data quantities are required for reliable response curve modeling with HOF models, which prevents the assessment of the responses of many rare species. To avoid undesired bias by differing sampling characteristics when comparing niches between different species or between data sets, the data basis used for model fitting should be adjusted according to the niche attribute in question, for example by keeping the frequency of the species constant...|$|R

Once over Otter Tail County, the storm intensified {{and a brief}} EF1 tornado touched down around 4:48 pm CDT (2248 UTC) roughly 12 mi south of Bluffton. The rear-flank downdraft of the storm quickly obscured the tornado from view; however, it was later determined the tornado {{was on the ground}} for 1.5 mi, uprooting small trees and snapping limbs of larger ones. At 4:56 pm CDT (2256 UTC), a tornado warning was issued for portions of Becker, Clearwater, Hubbard, Otter Tail and Wadena Counties. Only two minutes after the warning was issued, a new tornado touched down about 3 mi southwest of the city of Wadena. Within three minutes of forming, the multiple vortex tornado rapidly intensified, reaching EF4 intensity with winds estimated at 170 mph. Before crossing the Otter Tail-Wadena County <b>border,</b> the storm's <b>width</b> had reached 1.1 mi. The tornado then struck the western side of Wadena, causing widespread severe damage. Two houses were blown away from their foundations and many other houses and businesses were destroyed by this large wedge tornado. Many other structures were damaged to lesser degrees as well. Wadena High School lost its roof and was badly damaged. A bus garage and an apartment complex were also damaged and school buses were thrown into the air. Trees were also debarked and snapped throughout the town. Cars were tossed by the tornado and headstones were toppled at a cemetery in Wadena. About 20 people were injured. Damage from the tornado reached $32 million, making it the most destructive of the outbreak. In light of the damage in the city, a tornado emergency was declared for Sebeka and Nimrod; however, substantial damage never took place in these areas. Continuing northeastward, the tornado gradually weakened before dissipating at 5:16 pm CDT (2316 UTC), ending its 10 mi track. Around 5:30 pm CDT (2230 UTC), a third tornado, rated EF0, touched down within the supercell, this time roughly 1.5 mi south-southwest of Nimrod. Over the following 18 minutes, this storm made several touchdowns along a 14.8 mi track that continued into Cass County. Damage from this tornado was largely limited to broken tree limbs. Continuing northeast, the supercell eventually dissipated over Cass County around 6:30 pm CDT (2330 UTC).|$|R
60|$|When on the Pampas {{and looking}} southward, and whilst {{travelling}} northward, I could see for very many leagues the red granite and dark mica-schist forming the crest and eastern {{flank of the}} Portillo line. This great range, according to Dr. Gillies, can be traced with little interruption for 140 miles southward to the R. Diamante, where it unites with the western ranges: northward, according to this same author, it terminates where the R. Mendoza debouches from the mountains; but a little further north {{in the eastern part}} of the Cumbre section, there are, as we shall hereafter see, some mountain-masses of a brick-red porphyry, the last injected amidst many other porphyries, and having so close an analogy with the coarse red granite of the Portillo line, that I am tempted to believe that they belong to the same axis of injection; if so, the Portillo line is at least 200 miles in length. Its height, even in the lowest gap in the road, is 14,365 feet, and some of the pinnacles apparently attain an elevation of about 16,000 feet above the sea. The geological history of this grand chain appears to me eminently interesting. We may safely conclude, that at a former period the valley of Tenuyan existed as an arm of the sea, about twenty-miles in <b>width,</b> <b>bordered</b> on one hand by a ridge or chain of islets of the black calcareous shales and purple sandstones of the gypseous formation; and on the other hand, by a ridge or chain of islets composed of mica-slate, white granite, and perhaps to a partial extent of red granite. These two chains, whilst thus bordering the old sea-channel, must have been exposed for a vast lapse of time to alluvial and littoral action, during which the rocks were shattered, the fragments rounded, and the strata of conglomerate accumulated to a thickness of at least fifteen hundred or two thousand feet. The red orthitic granite now forms, as we have seen, the main part of the Portillo chain: it is injected in dikes not only into the mica-schist and white granites, but into the laminated sandstone, which it has metamorphosed, and which it has thrown off, together with the conformably overlying coloured beds and stratified conglomerate, at an angle of forty-five degrees. To have thrown off so vast a pile of strata at this angle, is a proof that the main part of the red granite (whether or not portions, as perhaps is probable, previously existed) was injected in a liquified state after the accumulation both of the laminated sandstone and of the conglomerate; this conglomerate, we know, was accumulated, not only after the deposition of the fossiliferous strata of the Peuquenes line, but after their elevation and long-continued denudation: and these fossiliferous strata belong to the early part of the Cretaceous system. Late, therefore, in a geological sense, as must be the age of the main part of the red granite, I can conceive nothing more impressive than the eastern view of this great range, as forcing the mind to grapple with the idea of the thousands of thousands of years requisite for the denudation of the strata which originally encased it,--for that the fluidified granite was once encased, its mineralogical composition and structure, and the bold conical shape of the mountain-masses, yield sufficient evidence. Of the encasing strata we see the last vestiges in the coloured beds on the crest, in the little caps of mica-schist on some of the loftiest pinnacles, and in the isolated patches of this same rock at corresponding heights on the now bare and steep flanks.|$|R
