500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the season, Sickels {{augmented}} his scouting {{report on}} Kinsler by reporting that he was: a good athlete, not super-toolsy, but strong for his size with speed a notch above average. His swing looked short, quick, and sharp. Although I'm told that some people worry that his swing is too long, it looked fine to me. [...] "Long swings" [...] usually show up in the stat line as excessive strikeout totals, but Kinsler is not a whiff king. He works the count well, controlling the strike zone without trouble and not swinging at pitches outside the plate area. His bat has some pop in it, particularly to the gaps, where he rifles frequent extra-base shots. He already has above-average power for a player his size, and I think he has enough bat speed to keep hitting home runs at higher levels. Defensively, he shows slightly above-average range and good hands. His arm strength is average, but he's accurate with his throws and seems fundamentally sound, although his error rate is higher than ideal (20 in 71 games at Frisco). He might end up at second base eventually. Kinsler's running speed is a bit <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>average,</b> but he's fairly aggressive on the bases and will steal if the opportunity is there. Overall, he is a solid all-around player who makes the most of his natural ability.|$|E
