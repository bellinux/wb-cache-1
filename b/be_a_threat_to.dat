5|$|Early on September 26, Tropical Storm Kyle {{was deemed}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Bermuda and a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for the islands. Later that day the watch was upgraded to {{a tropical storm}} warning as the storm neared the island. The following day, the warning was discontinued as Hurricane Kyle bypassed the island.|$|E
5|$|About a {{thousand}} pilot whales are killed this way {{each year on}} the Faroe Islands together with usually a few dozen up to a few hundred animals belonging to other small cetaceans species, but numbers vary greatly per year. The amount of Pilot Whales killed each year is not believed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the sustainability of the population, but the brutal appearance of the hunt has resulted in international criticism especially from animal welfare organisations.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} the test, Hyun-jun and Sa-woo {{were introduced to}} the director of the NSS, Baek San (Kim Yeong-cheol). Baek San explained to them that the NSS is a secret organization tasked with preempting foreign threats and protecting the country's interests through wetwork operations, including assassination of anyone who could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> South Korean (SK) national security. Since its founding in 1976, during the rule of Park Chung-hee, the agency's very existence has remained a state secret from everyone, including the President.|$|E
40|$|Many colleges/universities {{believe that}} <b>a</b> student who <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> self {{increases}} campus risk and liability (Appelbaum, 2006; Massie, 2008; Pavela, 2006 2 ̆ 6 2010). This study uses integrated policy analysis to (1) define the policy problem regarding {{college students who}} <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> self; (2) analyze the current legal opinion of the courts regarding institutional liability when college students <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> self; (3) examine the 2010 change <b>to</b> the direct <b>threat</b> provision in Title II legislation; (4) determine the implications for institutional policies and practices. The analysis illustrates, according to the courts and changes in Title II legislation, the true increase in risk and liability occurs when colleges/universities do not proactively plan for and support students who <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> self...|$|R

5|$|Immigration {{became an}} {{important}} issue for the Vlaams Blok from the late 1980s. Interconnected with the Flemish nationalism issue, immigrants were considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the Flemish ethnic community. In 1992, the party established its 70-point plan, which included measures to stop all immigration, return most immigrants to their native countries by force, and legally discriminate against residing migrants in respect of markets such as labour, housing and education. The party's opponents particularly saw its immigration program {{as a source of}} claims of racism, and the party thus in its latest years downplayed the relevance of the 70-point plan, and softened its written positions regarding immigration.|$|E
5|$|In 1920 {{more of the}} {{south-west}} corner {{collapsed and}} the castle's owner, Lord Hothfield, gave the property to the Office of Works. Work to stabilise the ruins was carried out and the castle, as a listed building and ancient monument, eventually passed into the control of English Heritage as a tourist attraction. There were initial archaeological excavations on the site in 1925, and then further work in 1970-71, 1993, 2007 and 2009. Erosion continues to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the castle's masonry, and as of 2010 English Heritage considered the castle's condition to be declining, with some parts at particular risk.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} was often tense between the City and the Crown. The City of London {{had been a}} stronghold of republicanism during the Civil War (1642–1651), and the wealthy and economically dynamic capital still {{had the potential to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Charles II, as had been demonstrated by several republican uprisings in London in the early 1660s. The City magistrates were of the generation that had fought in the Civil War, and could remember how Charles I's grab for absolute power had led to that national trauma.|$|E

5|$|As a {{precursor}} low-pressure area, Sam brought widespread rainfall throughout a wide swath of northern Australia. Due to {{its proximity to}} the coast throughout its existence, associated rainfall continued to affect the region throughout Sam's existence. As Sam approached the coast, numerous warnings were issued, with storm warnings posted for Cape Leveque to Pardoo Station on 8December. Meteorologists indicated that the storm would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> shipping in the immediate regions. Due to its impending threat to the northwestern coast of Australia, most {{of the residents of}} Bidyadanga and Anna Springs Station were evacuated via helicopter. Upon landfall, though severe damage was wrought, damage was localized. The lowest barometric pressure recorded was a measurement of 973mbar (hPa; 28.74inHg). Some buildings were severely damaged, and trees, power lines, sheds, and fences were downed by the strong winds. Staff quarters and sheds in the Anna Plains Station were demolished. The cattle station also lost electrical power during the storm.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hurricane}} traversed the Central Atlantic, the United States Weather Bureau {{indicated that the}} storm would not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> continental land masses due to its isolated position. However, ships in the storm's vicinity and to the northwest of {{the hurricane}} were advised caution. Other shipping lanes in the forecast path of the hurricane were also warned. After recurving {{in the direction of}} Bermuda, the British overseas colony was advised to begin prompt precautionary measures against storm surge and strong winds, which were expected from the hurricane. Aircraft from the United States Air Force and Navy stationed in Bermuda were sent to airfields in the United States to avoid the hurricane, while a Navy task force of twelve ships including the escort carrier USS Mindoro (CVE-120) were dispatched from the island. The U.S. naval operating base moved boats from exposed areas into safer parts of the base. Similar precautionary measures were undertaken by the British naval operating base.|$|E
5|$|Château Gaillard was {{captured}} in 1204 by the king of France, Philip II, after a lengthy siege. In the mid-14th century, the castle was the residence of the exiled David II of Scotland. The castle changed hands {{several times in the}} Hundred Years' War, but in 1449 the French king captured Château Gaillard from the English king definitively, and from then on it remained in French ownership. Henry IV of France ordered the demolition of Château Gaillard in 1599; although it was in ruins at the time, it was felt to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the security of the local population. The castle ruins are listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. The inner bailey {{is open to the public}} from March to November, and the outer baileys are open all year.|$|E

5|$|Giraffes {{have high}} adult {{survival}} probability, and an unusually long lifespan {{compared to other}} ruminants, up to 25 years in the wild. Because of their size, eyesight and powerful kicks, adult giraffes are usually not subject to predation, aside from lions. Giraffes {{are the most common}} prey for the big cats in Kruger National Park. Nile crocodiles can also <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> giraffes when they bend down to drink. Calves are much more vulnerable than adults, and are additionally preyed on by leopards, spotted hyenas and wild dogs. A quarter to a half of giraffe calves reach adulthood. Calf survival varies according to the season of birth, with calves born during the dry season having higher survival rates. The local, seasonal presence of large herds of migratory wildebeests and zebras reduces predation pressure on giraffe calves and increases their survival probability.|$|E
5|$|Leaders of El Grito de Lares {{who were}} in exile in New York City joined the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee, founded on December 8, 1895 to {{continue}} the quest for independence. In 1897, {{with the aid of}} Antonio Mattei Lluberas and Fidel Velez, the local leaders of the independence movement of the town of Yauco, they organized another uprising, which became known as the Intentona de Yauco. On March 26, 1897, there was a second and last major attempt to overthrow the Spanish government. The local conservative political factions, which believed that such an attempt would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> their struggle for autonomy, opposed such an action. Rumors of the planned event spread to the local Spanish authorities, who acted swiftly {{and put an end to}} what would be the last major uprising in the island to Spanish colonial rule.|$|E
5|$|Rights of {{a person}} arrested under {{ordinary}} circumstances is laid down in {{the right to life}} and personal liberty. No one can be arrested without being told the grounds for his arrest. If arrested, the person has the right to defend himself by a lawyer of his choice. Also an arrested citizen has to be brought before the nearest magistrate within 24 hours. The rights {{of a person}} arrested under ordinary circumstances are not available to an enemy alien. They are also not available to persons detained under the Preventive Detention Act. Under preventive detention, the government can imprison a person for a maximum of three months. It means that if the government feels that a person being at liberty can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the law and order or to the unity and integrity of the nation, it can detain or arrest that person to prevent him from doing this possible harm. After three months such a case is brought before an advisory board for review.|$|E

5|$|Selendis is the {{executor}} of the Protoss military {{following the}} reunification of the race. The character is introduced in the novel Twilight and in the Wings of Liberty campaign, where she is played by Cree Summer. Selendis is fiercely loyal to her race's ideals and completely dedicated to her responsibilities. A protégée of Artanis, she considers the dark templar to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> her heritage but is willing to work beside them. Selendis is particularly eager to reclaim Aiur from the Zerg. Shortly after Artanis cleanses Shakuras of Zerg, Selendis takes part in an expedition to rescue three stranded heroes from Aiur; however, the mission was sabotaged by Ulrezaj, who kills two of the trapped warriors. During this time, Selendis became aware of other Protoss survivors stranded on Aiur, but as it was not believed possible to save them, their existence is kept secret. Later, Selendis commands the defenses of the dark templar archives on Ehlna against attack by Zerg and Ulrezaj, resulting in Ulrezaj's defeat.|$|E
5|$|Some {{media outlets}} tied {{the fact that}} the red supergiant star Betelgeuse would undergo a {{supernova}} {{at some point in the}} future to the 2012 phenomenon. However, while Betelgeuse was certainly in the final stages of its life, and would die as a supernova, there was no way to predict the timing of the event to within 100,000 years. To <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Earth, a supernova would need to be no further than 25 light years from the Solar System. Betelgeuse is roughly 600 light years away, and so its supernova would not affect Earth. In December 2011, NASA's Francis Reddy issued a press release debunking the possibility of a supernova occurring in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The Secretary of State Nguyễn Đính Thuan and Interior Minister Bùi Văn Lương {{were caught}} off guard by the attacks. The initial {{perception}} was that the military establishment had suddenly cracked down on the Buddhists because they were deemed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the war effort. The government propagated a theory which held that the military felt compelled to take action after pro-Buddhist student unrest on 17–18 August. In Huế, student protestors had turned on an ARVN officer after he fired in their direction. The attacks were preceded by a large rally at Xá Lợi during which some monks had called for {{the overthrow of the}} Diệm regime and denounced the anti-Buddhist statements of the de facto first lady Madame Nhu. However, observers dismissed government claims that the raids were spontaneous.|$|E

5|$|In his absence, {{the issue}} of female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM) had become a topic of strong debate in Kikuyu society. The Protestant churches, backed by European medics and the colonial authorities, supported the abolition of this traditional practice, but the KCA rallied to its defence, claiming that its abolition would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the structure and customs of Kikuyu society. Anger {{between the two sides}} had heightened, with several churches expelling KCA members from their congregations, and it was widely believed that the January 1930 killing of the American nun, Hulda Stumpf, had been due to the issue. As Secretary of the KCA, Kenyatta soon attended a meeting with church representatives. There, he expressed the view that although he personally opposed FGM, he regarded its legal abolition as counter-productive, and that the churches should focus on eradicating the practice through education of its harmful effects on women's health. The meeting ended without compromise, and John Arthur—the head of the Church of Scotland in Kenya—later complained about what he described as Kenyatta's dishonesty during the debate, expelling him from the church. In 1931, Kenyatta took his son out of the church school at Thogota and enrolled him in a KCA-approved, independent school.|$|E
5|$|Joseph's {{reforms were}} deeply unpopular within the Austrian Netherlands. The Enlightenment had made few inroads into the territory, {{and it was}} widely distrusted as a foreign {{phenomenon}} which was not compatible with traditional local values. The majority of the population, especially influenced by the Church, believed the reforms to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> their own cultures and traditions which would leave them worse off. Even in pro-Enlightenment circles, the reforms caused discontent which were seen as not sufficiently radical and not far reaching enough. Popular opposition was centered on the provincial states, in particular Hainaut, Brabant and Flanders, {{as well as their}} law courts. There was a wave of critical pamphleting. In some towns, riots broke out and the militia had to be called to suppress them. The Estate of Brabant called a lawyer, Hendrik Van der Noot, to defend their position publicly. Van der Noot publicly accused the reforms of violating the precedents established by the Joyous Entry of 1356 which was widely regarded as a traditional bill of rights for the region.|$|E
5|$|Zahir {{maintained}} tolerant {{policies and}} encouraged {{the involvement of}} religious minorities in the local economy. As part of his larger efforts to enlarge the population of Galilee, Zahir invited Jews to resettle in Tiberias around 1742, along with Muslims. Zahir did not consider Jews to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> his rule and believed that their connections with the Jewish diaspora would encourage economic development in Tiberias, which the Jews considered particularly holy. His tolerance towards the Jews, the cuts in taxes levied on them, and assistance {{in the construction of}} Jewish homes, schools and synagogues, helped foster the growth of the Jewish community in the area. The initial Jewish immigrants came from Damascus and were later followed by Jews from Aleppo, Cyprus and Smyrna. Many Jews in Safad, which was governed by Zahir's son Ali, moved to Tiberias in the 1740s to take advantage of better opportunities in that city, which at the time was under Zahir's direct rule. The villages of Kafr Yasif and Shefa-'Amr also saw new Jewish communities spring up under Zahir's rule.|$|E
