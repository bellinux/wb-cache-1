Explorer was built by Messrs Alexander Hall & Co., Aberdeen, for the Scottish Home Department; to replace a 1917 built vessel of the same name. The Fishery Research Ship Explorer entered service in 1956 and was operated by the Marine Laboratory in Aberdeen. The role of the Explorer was to investigate fish breeding and feeding grounds so as to establish fishing levels and species types for the British market. In addition pollution and fish diseases that might adversely affect catches were monitored. The classic lines of a Deep Sea <b>Beam</b> <b>Trawler</b> were well suited to working in the traditional fishing grounds, and extra strengthening of the hull prepared her also for service in the Arctic waters off Greenland and Iceland, and the Barents and White Seas north of Russia.|$|E

Beam trawling for flatfish is the main occupation of the Dutch skipper-owned fishing fleet. Using three input factors and four output variables, individual and average capacity utilisation (CU) scores (extent to which available capacity is made productive) were estimated, followed by estimates of capacity output (maximum production with available capacity) and technically efficient output (production with technically efficient use of available capacity). In a secondary stage analysis, a number of environmental factors were identified that significantly influence CU scores.

40|$|We {{examine whether}} the landing rates of Belgian beam {{trawlers}} in the Southern Bight of the North Sea were affected through competitive {{interactions with the}} Dutch <b>beam</b> <b>trawler</b> fleet and whether {{the development of a}} pulse trawler fleet has altered competitive interactions between both fleets. Effects of competition were investigated through a natural experiment based on the different weekly exploitation patterns of both fleets. Logbook data were used to fit a generalized additive mixed model for the daily landing rates of the target species sole (Solea solea) and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). Results showed that landing rates of sole by the Belgian beam trawlers (> 221 kW) from 2006 to 2013 were lower during weekdays than during weekends when the Dutch trawler fleet is in harbour, while no such an effect was found for plaice. After the development of a pulse trawler fleet in 2011, the negative weekday effect in the sole landing rates was much more pronounced in 2012 and 2013.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the heterogeneity of}} the Belgian fishing fleet based on “strategic groups”, a concept borrowed {{from the field of}} strategic management. Its objectives are: (1) to define strategic groups within the Belgian fishing fleet; (2) to examine the performance differences among these strategic groups; (3) to examine whether firms (i. e., vessels) move between strategic groups over time; and (4) to examine if firm-movement (i. e., vessel-movement) differs across strategic groups. In this study, strategic groups are derived through clustering firms based on their state of resources, built up through the collection of their past competitive strategic decisions, which are perceived as the main sources of mobility barriers (i. e. competitive advantages) in the fishing industry, namely: (1) technology, (2) product range and (3) geographic reach. Highly valid cluster solutions are obtained through use of excessive within- and between-method triangulation. Following this method, five strategic groups are identified that have distinct performance outcomes: (1) the large <b>beam</b> <b>trawler</b> fleet; (2) the small <b>beam</b> <b>trawler</b> fleet; (3) the shrimp <b>beam</b> <b>trawler</b> fleet; (4) the otter trawler fleet; and (5) the trammel netter fleet. Furthermore, in terms of firm movement and group loyalty, this study finds that once a vessel has decided on its strategic position in the fishing industry (i. e., the strategic group), in 80 % of the cases, it stays in that position for a significant amount of time (in this case 10 years). However, not every strategic group enjoys this high level of group loyalty, since firm-movement differs significantly between the strategic groups. Although this is definitely a topic for further research, a possible interpretation for this phenomenon is the theory of “asymmetric mobility barriers” in combination with a firm's “isolating mechanisms”. The value of this study lies in its practical relevance to both policymakers and ship owners. Strategic group theory gives insight into the strategic differences and the patterns of rivalry between firms within the same industry. Such insights are crucial when managing fisheries and could result in regulations which are more focused on (1) affecting strategic groups’ competitive advantages (i. e., mobility barriers), (2) affecting “isolating mechanisms” of firms, and (3) managing rivalry between strategic groups. Ship owners and skippers can use {{the results of this study}} on the different performance potentials for the different competitive strategies in the current industry to determine if they are still satisfied with their current strategic direction. It allows them to reflect on current business and change strategic course based on the various performance indicators included in this research...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to ecosystem related concerns about bottom trawling and particularly beam trawling that {{were raised by}} various scientists in the last decades of the previous century.

The development of pulse trawling was again taken up in the 1990 s by a private company (Verburg:Holland Ltd.) in The Netherlands. Meanwhile questions about ecosystem effects of introducing pulse beam trawling in the Dutch flatfish fishery were raised by the European Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) and the Inter: national Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and discussed at the meeting of the ICES Working Group on Fishing Technology and Fish Behaviour (WGFTFB) in 2006.

40|$|Background: This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} subsidies on the profitability and ecological stability of the North Sea fisheries over the past 20 years. It shows the negative impact that subsidies can have on both the biomass of important fish species and the possible profit from fisheries. The study includes subsidies in an ecosystem model of the North Sea and examines the possible effects of eliminating fishery subsidies. Methodology/Principal Findings: Hindcast analysis between 1991 and 2003 indicates that subsidies reduced the profitability of the fishery even though gross revenue might have been high for specific fisheries sectors. Simulations seeking to maximise the total revenue between 2004 and 2010 suggest {{that this can be}} achieved by increasing the effort of Nephrops <b>trawlers,</b> <b>beam</b> <b>trawlers,</b> and the pelagic trawl-and-seine fleet, while reducing the effort of demersal trawlers. Simulations show that ecological stability can be realised by reducing the effort of the <b>beam</b> <b>trawlers,</b> Nephrops trawlers, pelagic- and demersal trawl-and-seine fleets. This analysis also shows that when subsidies are included, effort will always be higher for all fleets, because it effectively reduces the cost of fishing. Conclusions/Significance: The study found that while removing subsidies might reduce the total catch and revenue, it increases the overall profitability of the fishery and the total biomass of commercially important species. For example, cod, haddock, herring and plaice biomass increased over the simulation when optimising for profit, and when optimising fo...|$|R

40|$|Abstract only. How do {{fishermen}} choose {{where to}} fish? A logistic random utility model (RUM) of fisher location choice by <b>beam</b> <b>trawlers</b> {{in the southwest}} of England was used to help answer this question. The RUM was parameterised {{using data from the}} EU vessel monitoring system, the UK logbook Fishing Activity database and the UK Fishing Vessel Register from 2005 to 2008. Individual vessel location choices and model variables were aggregated to ICES statistical rectangles (approximately 30 nautical miles square) by month. The model outputs show that vessels in southwest England made location choices (in 2005 - 2007) based on recent economic returns (value of catch per hour fished) in the month prior and in the previous year in the same month. Vessel skippers also made decisions based on the economic returns of the entire fleet; and tended to choose locations that yielded higher economic returns to the fleet compared to other available locations. This suggests a transfer of knowledge on what others in the fleet are catching and where. <b>Beam</b> <b>trawlers</b> also appeared to be risk-averse, preferring to fish locations closer to their homeport, and at locations with less variance in the value of catch per unit effort at a location, even if the economic returns could be high elsewhere. Vessels also preferred to fish in deeper water, particularly the larger vessels of the fleet. To evaluate the models predictive ability, we compared 2008 location choices with predicted choices using the 2005 - 2007 model coefficients. The model correctly predicted vessels not fishing in a rectangle in 97...|$|R
40|$|Effort {{management}} {{has been proposed}} as an alternative for quota management in mixed demersal fisheries. It requires a metric to estimate the fishing mortality imposed by a given quantity of nominal fishing effort. Here, we estimate the partial fishing mortality rate imposed by one unit of fishing effort (Fpue) during individual fishing trips and explore the usefulness of this indicator for managing North Sea beam trawlers > 300 hp targeting sole (Solea solea) and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). Fpue is positively related to vessel engine power, and increased annually by 2. 8 % (sole) and 1. 6 % (plaice). The positive trend was due {{to an increase in}} skipper skills and investment in auxiliary equipment, the replacement of old vessels by new ones and, to a lesser extent, to upgrade engines. The average Fpue imposed per day at sea by a 2000 hp <b>beam</b> <b>trawler</b> was estimated to be 1. 0 × 10 ¿ 5 (sole) and 0. 6 × 10 ¿ 5 (plaice), and it showed substantial seasonal and spatial variations.

The existence of predictive seasonal and spatial patterns in Fpue opens up the possibility of fine-tuning management by directed effort restrictions and uncoupling management of plaice and sol...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{concern about}} the ecosystem effects of fishing on the marine environment and particularly, the impact of trawling on benthic communities is reflected in numerous publications. The weight of this concern will very likely only increase in management decisions in the near future. Beam trawling has a negative reputation with regard to discarding and seafloor impact and may be confronted with further constraints imposed by the fisheries management. The fishing industry has, however, the opportunity to anticipate management decisions and to adopt improved fishing gears, i. e. with reduced discarding and reduced environmental impact. A pro-active attitude and a voluntary uptake of improved gears allows the industry to shape the alterations to the specific conditions of the fishery and the fishing grounds. For the chain matrix beam trawl, many studies {{have been carried out}} {{on a wide variety of}} technical alterations to the beam trawl to improve the length and species selectivity, to reduce ecosystem effects and to reduce fuel consumption. The ILVO-Fishery institute has carried out many of these experiments and has recently been testing and promoting a combination of successful alterations. The improved trawl has been called the “alternative beam trawl” and has already been commercially tested for two years on a <b>beam</b> <b>trawler.</b> It consists of a number of simple and cheap alterations to the beam trawl. This report is a compilation of the most successful technical alterations for the beam trawl. The alternative beam trawl is not strictly defined and can consist of any combination of selective devices presented in this report or even new devices that prove to be successful.

40|$|Under the “high survival” {{exemption}} of the European {{landing obligation}} or discard ban, monitoring vitality and survival of European flatfish becomes {{relevant to a}} discard-intensive beam trawl fishery. The reflex action mortality predictor (RAMP) method {{may be useful in}} this context. It involves scoring for {{the presence or absence of}} natural animal reflexes to generate an impairment score which is then correlated with post-release or discard mortality. In our first experiment, we determined suitable candidate reflexes for acclimated, laboratory-held European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and common sole (Solea solea). In a second experiment, we quantified reflex impairment of commercially trawled-and-handled plaice and sole in response to commercial fishing stressors. In a third experiment, we tested whether a combined reflex impairment and injury (vitality) score of plaice was correlated with delayed post-release mortality to establish RAMP. Five-hundred fourteen trawled-and-discarded plaice and 176 sole were assessed for experimentally confirmed reflexes such as righting, evasion, stabilise, and tail grab, among others. Of these fish, 316 plaice were monitored for at least 14 d in captivity, alongside 60 control plaice. All control fish survived, together with an average of 50 % (± 29 SD) plaice after being trawled from conventional, 60 min trawls and sorted on-board a coastal <b>beam</b> <b>trawler.</b> Stressors such as trawl duration, wave height, air, and seawater temperature were not as relevant as a vitality score and total length in predicting post-release survival probability. In the second experiment where survival was not assessed, reflex impairment of plaice became more frequent with prolonged air exposure. For sole, a researcher handling-and-reflex scoring bias rather than a fishing stressor may have confounded results. Scoring a larger number of individuals for injuries and reflexes from a representative selection of trawls and trips may allow for a fleet-scale discard survival estimate to facilitate implementation of the discard ban...|$|E
40|$|The {{southern}} North Sea is {{the stage}} of conflicting objectives of <b>beam</b> <b>trawlers</b> targeting flatfish; of shrimp trawlers fishing for brown shrimp with bycatch of juvenile flatfish; and of demersal trawlers, the main fishery on cod, a key predator of shrimp and other groups.

Long-term projections highlighted multiple fishing regimes that lead to catches of at least 30 % of all focal stocks' single species MSYs at the same time. Trade-offs between the yields of shrimp fishers and demersal trawlers made higher simultaneous yields impossible. Besides optimizing multispecies catches, we identified effort regimes that satisfied a set of descriptors of good environmental status (GES).

This study presents the first discard survival estimates on-board Dutch commercial pulse trawlers. During seven, six, and one fishing trip(s), respectively, undersized plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), sole (Solea solea), and dab (Limanda limanda) were collected, assessed for vitality and subsequently monitored up to 21 days. Uncorrected for any potential impacts from predation, tagging, research-related handling, or holding conditions overall survival for plaice (n¼ 349), sole (n¼ 226), and dab (n¼ 187) was assessed as 15 % [95 % CI: 11 – 19 %], 29 % [95 % CI: 24 – 35 %], and 16 % [95 % CI: 10 – 26 %] respectively. Survival was mainly effected by water temperature and factors linked to the fishing vessel. Fish length was not found to affect survival.

In coastal waters, gillnetting is often used as a second fishing method by <b>trawlers</b> or <b>beam</b> <b>trawlers,</b> depending on fishing seasons and targeted species. For offshore fishing, or fishing on the high seas, medium-sized vessels using drifting gillnets are called drifters, and the bridge is usually located aft. The nets are set and hauled by hand on small open boats. Larger boats use hydraulic or occasionally mechanical net haulers, or net drums. These vessels can be equipped with an echosounder, although locating fish is {{more a matter of}} the fishermen's personal knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than depending on special detection equipment.|$|R
