5|$|Following {{his release}} from the {{hospital}} and as a prisoner of war—the exact date is unknown—Schnaufer took over the family wine business. He had never planned to run the family winery as his ambition had always been to pursue an officer's career in the Luftwaffe. However, {{in the immediate aftermath}} of World War II the business had virtually ceased to exist and Schnaufer was given the task of rebuilding it from scratch. He had to re-establish <b>business</b> <b>links</b> to suppliers and customers and to consolidate them. Then he had to make new contacts in order to facilitate expansion and growth of the business. Lastly, he had to create an infrastructure which supported the growth of the business.|$|E
5|$|His {{business}} interests having collapsed, Baker abandoned his farm and relocated from New South Wales {{to the southern}} settlement of Hobart in Van Diemen's Land. In 1814 he is recorded as holding the office of government storekeeper in Hobart. A year later, at an approximate age of 54, he accepted a job as town crier for the newly created Deputy Judge Advocate's Court, calling witnesses and announcing verdicts on the roadside outside the courthouse. Any remaining <b>business</b> <b>links</b> with New South Wales were severed in 1819 with the sale of Baker's former farm to a colleague, Samuel Terry, who had recently visited him in Hobart. His wife, Elizabeth Baker, died in April 1824 and was buried in Hobart Cemetery.|$|E

50|$|In {{many ways}} it is similar to what <b>Business</b> <b>Link</b> {{provides}} for all small businesses, except that <b>Business</b> <b>Link</b> {{may not have the}} in-depth experience of manufacturing, specifically the technical know-how. From November 2011 <b>Business</b> <b>Link</b> is mostly to be disbanded, due to abolishment of regional development agencies (RDAs), and replaced with regional websites.Much of <b>Business</b> <b>Link's</b> advice was previously via its extensive website.

40|$|We explore {{patterns}} of take-up of <b>Business</b> <b>Link</b> services in Northamptonshire, a {{county in the}} East Midlands region of the UK. Our findings indicate a relationship between small firm growth and use of <b>Business</b> <b>Link.</b> The results suggest that newer firms that are larger and experiencing growth {{are more likely to}} approach <b>Business</b> <b>Link</b> in order to `cope with' rapid growth, whereas those seeking to internationalise are more likely to do so when stimulated by <b>Business</b> <b>Link.</b> On the basis of these findings we develop a framework for understanding different forms of engagement between small and medium-sized enterprises and <b>Business</b> <b>Link</b> service providers, and how these relationships develop and change over time. This framework highlights variations in the modes of engagement between these two parties and highlights the dynamic and evolving nature of interaction between small <b>business</b> and <b>Business</b> <b>Link</b> as an intrinsic driver of take-up of service...|$|R

As a result of the political uprisings in Burma, the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund withdrew from the fundraising golf tournament because of Player's unsubstantiated <b>business</b> <b>links</b> with the country. Both Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu accepted Player's position and statements on Burma. Player refused to withdraw as he personally built the golf event from scratch and issued a statement rebutting these claims via his website.

25|$|The Japanese {{spread the}} word {{that they were the}} 'Light of Asia'. Japan was the only Asian nation that had {{successfully}} transformed itself into a modern technological society {{at the end of the}} 19th century and it remained independent when most Asian countries had been under European or American power, and had beaten a European power, Russia, in war. Following its military campaign in China Japan turned its attention to Southeast Asia advocating to other Asians a 'Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere', which they described as a type of trade zone under Japanese leadership. The Japanese had gradually spread their influence through Asia in the first half of the 20th century and during the 1920s and 1930s had established <b>business</b> <b>links</b> in the Indies. These ranged from small town barbers, photographic studios and salesmen, to large department stores and firms such as Suzuki and Mitsubishi becoming involved in the sugar trade.|$|E

It became much more affordable in terms of cost of living relative to cities worldwide, with its ranking moving from 93rd (more expensive) to 139th (less expensive) in 2009, probably as a result of currency fluctuations during the global economic downturn from March 2008 to March 2009.

During the Classical period, various parts of India were ruled by numerous dynasties for the next 1,500 years, among which the Gupta Empire stands out. This period, witnessing a Hindu religious and intellectual resurgence, is known as the classical or [...] "Golden Age of India". During this period, aspects of Indian civilisation, administration, culture, and religion (Hinduism and Buddhism) spread to much of Asia, while kingdoms in southern India had maritime <b>business</b> <b>links</b> with the Middle East and the Mediterranean.

40|$|<b>Business</b> <b>Link</b> in Britain {{is one of}} {{the main}} recent {{government}} initiatives to support SMEs in the EU. The paper uses a 1997 survey of SMEs to determine how <b>Business</b> <b>Link</b> use, impact and satisfaction are influenced by firm characteristics, local partnership characteristics, local geographical context, service intensity and other explanatory variables. The paper presents econometric estimates based on logit and ordered logit models. A key finding of the paper is that local context is not very significant to service use, impact or satisfaction, but local <b>Business</b> <b>Link</b> management and adviser performance are important influences on the impact and satisfaction. Major differences in the way SMEs use government-backed services are also found. These are high volumes of use of 'gateway' information services producing only low impact, and low volumes, but high impacts and satisfaction with intensive advice services governed by contracts between the clients and the advisor. Implications for the Small Business Service, launched in April 2000, are drawn. <b>Business</b> Advice, <b>Business</b> <b>Link,</b> Consultancy, Logit, Ordered Logit...|$|R
