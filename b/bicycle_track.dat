5|$|While {{the initial}} lease with Darlington {{confined}} {{the park to}} between the railroad and the north bank of the Loyalhanna Creek, permission was later granted for construction of a bridge across the river, allowing expansion to {{the south in the}} mid-1880s. Three lakes, Woodland, St. Clair, and Bouquet, were dug between 1880 and 1896. In 1896, the park added a T.M. Harton Company steam carousel {{in the center of the}} park. The Pittsburgh-based company was a major manufacturer of carousels and roller coasters. By the end of the 19th century, attractions at the park included a <b>bicycle</b> <b>track</b> around Lake Bouquet, a hiking trail on the lake's island, fishing in the Loyalhanna Creek, rowboating, and many walks and gardens. The park had dining halls, auditoriums, pavilions, a boathouse, an amphitheater, a bandstand, and athletic facilities.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a monocular vision based 3 D <b>bicycle</b> <b>tracking</b> framework for intelligent vehicles {{based on a}} detection method exploiting a deformable part model and a tracking method using an Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) algorithm. <b>Bicycle</b> <b>tracking</b> is important because bicycles share the road with vehicles and can move at comparable speeds in urban environments. From a computer vision standpoint, bicycle detection is challenging as bicycle’s appearance can change dramatically between viewpoints and a person riding on the bicycle is a non-rigid object. To this end, we present a tracking-by-detection method to detect and <b>track</b> <b>bicycles</b> {{that takes into account}} these difficult issues. First, a mixture model of multiple viewpoints is defined and trained via a Latent Support Vector Machine (LSVM) to detect bicycles under a variety of circumstances. Each model uses a partbased representation. This robust bicycle detector provides a series of measurements (i. e., bounding boxes) {{in the context of the}} Kalman filter. Second, to exploit the unique characteristics of <b>bicycle</b> <b>tracking,</b> two motion models based on bicycle’s kinematics are fused using an IMM algorithm. For each motion model, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used to estimate the position and velocity of a bicycle in the vehicle coordinates. Finally, a single <b>bicycle</b> <b>tracking</b> method using an IMM algorithm is extended to that of multiple <b>bicycle</b> <b>tracking</b> by incorporating a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter which runs a particle filter for a data association and an IMM filter for each <b>bicycle</b> <b>tracking.</b> We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through a series of experiments run on a new bicycle dataset captured from a vehicle-mounted camera.

25|$|The 1980s was a {{turbulent}} {{time for the}} Yakuza organizations, the Yamaguchi Gumi that Yoshinori Watanabe belonged to was not excluded from this turmoil.

Kazuo Taoka’s widowed wife acted as Kumicho for until she named Masahisa Takenaka to lead the Yamaguchi Gumi in 1984. Masahisa Takenaka succession led to a violent division in the Yamaguchi Gumi and a violent gang war. Masahisa Takenaka was gunned down in 1985 by the Ichiwa-kai gang, a Yamaguchi Gumi splinter gang. Four weeks later, two Ichiwa-kai gangsters were killed at a <b>bicycle</b> <b>track</b> by Yamaguchi Gumi members. A year later, the Ichiwa-kai gang’s leader was shot to death. The war between Yamaguchi Gumi and the splinter group killed more than 30 gang members and a few bystanders. At one three-month period, 12 people were killed and 17 people were wounded. This war would be known as the Yama-Ichi War. In 1989, Yoshinori Watanabe took the position of 5th Generation Kumicho of Yamaguchi Gumi and ended nearly ten years of violent power struggle within the largest yakuza organization.|$|E
500|$|Hill was {{the victim}} of bad luck during this {{sequence}} of scores between 90 and 99. [...] At Melbourne during the New Years Test he scored 99; the first time a batsman was dismissed one run short of a century in Test cricket. In the first innings in the next Test in Adelaide, having scored 98, Hill was caught by Johnny Tyldesley who was standing on the <b>bicycle</b> <b>track</b> surrounding the oval. [...] Tyldesley attempted to call Hill back but Hill declined, saying the captains had agreed that the fence was the boundary, not the track. [...] Under modern laws, he would have been notout and the shot would count as six runs, allowing him his century. [...] In the second innings, Hill's poor luck continued. He chopped down on a ball when 97 and then, to his horror, saw the ball rolling back towards his stumps. [...] He attempted to hit the ball away from the stumps but accidentally knocked the leg bail and was out, bowled. The English writer, Simon Wilde, has described this sequence as an [...] "unparalleled spell of nonagenarians' neurosis".|$|E

40|$|Results are {{discussed}} of {{an analysis of}} data on road sections within built-up areas in cities with more than 50000 inhabitants. Road sections were divided into roads without bicycle facilities, road sections with bicycle lanes and roads with cycle tracks. A different kind of facility is a cycle track separated from the road by a verge and cycle lanes which are only separated from the road by a marking line; {{they have the same}} surface as the road. Attention is mainly given in this report to the comparison of <b>bicycle</b> <b>tracks</b> with other <b>bicycle</b> provisions. Emphasis is placed on moped accidents so as to study the question whether moped riders should use bicycle lanes and <b>bicycle</b> <b>tracks</b> or not. Up to now in the netherlands moped riders do often use such bicycle facilities. Cyclists are relatively less involved in accidents on cycle tracks. Moped riders are much more involved in accidents on cycle tacks. Most accidents occur at junctions. Collisions of pedestrians and cyclists with moped riders happen more on roads with <b>bicycle</b> <b>tracks</b> than on other roads...|$|R

The development would provide alternative accommodation to vendors of the existing market on the Marina Loop Road by commissioning of a modern fish market on the stretch. The loop road connecting the Lighthouse and Foreshore Estate, which is currently a 20-metre-wide road, will be converted to a four-lane concrete road barricaded on both sides with stainless steel pillared railings and will pass all along the Santhome coast of the Marina Beach.

2500|$|Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss {{secured a}} lease {{on the park}} in 1901 as a {{preventative}} measure to keep the upstart American League from establishing a competing baseball franchise in Pittsburgh. Hoping also {{to profit from the}} grounds, Dreyfuss put in a modern <b>bicycle</b> <b>track</b> to be used for motor-paced races featuring the stars of the sport. Baseball umpire and boxing referee Tim Hurst was manager of the facility, which opened in May 1902 under a name variously spelled as [...] "Colosseum" [...] or [...] "Coliseum." [...] The track was a smooth wooden oval with 20-foot-high bankings and encompassed a multipurpose field. Surrounding the track was newly built seating for 7,000 spectators, comprising two covered grandstands—one each on the north and south sides—and open bleachers. The venture was not long in proving a failure: Cycling did not catch on as a spectator sport, and the stadium's alternative use as a football venue was less than lucrative. No longer fearing an invasion by an opposition baseball team, Dreyfuss let the lease expire in April 1904. The track was torn down and the grounds turned back over to the owners.|$|E

As {{he had not been}} among the original entries for the race, Oppenheimer had to pay a supplementary entry fee of €120,000. The draw for starting stalls saw Golden Horn allotted the fourteenth stall, on the wide outside of the field: Dettori commented [...] "I’d have loved a single-figure number but we’ll have to deal with what we’ve got.
