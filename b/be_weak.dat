5|$|Rallidae is a {{large family}} of small to {{medium-sized}} birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots and gallinules. The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to <b>be</b> <b>weak</b> fliers.|$|E

The four elements include: Heat (fire-based), Aqua (water and ice-based), Elec (electricity-based), and Wood (plant and wind-based). Elements {{are attached to}} certain attacks and to enemies' (or Mega Man's) defenses. When an element is hit with an element that it <b>is</b> <b>weak</b> to, double-damage <b>is</b> dealt. Heat <b>is</b> <b>weak</b> against Aqua but strong against Wood, Aqua <b>is</b> <b>weak</b> against Elec but strong against Heat, Elec <b>is</b> <b>weak</b> against Wood but strong against Aqua, and Wood <b>is</b> <b>weak</b> against Heat but strong against Elec.|$|R
50|$|Star Force {{continues}} the same elemental properties that previous Star Force titles have used. The four elements include: Heat, Aqua, Elec, and Wood.

Sensitivity is not determined by neuron density alone: other factors include the branching patterns of neuron terminals and cross or collateral innervation of neurons. While G-spot opponents argue that because there are very few tactile nerve endings in the vagina and that therefore the G-spot cannot exist, G-spot proponents argue that vaginal orgasms rely on pressure-sensitive nerves.|$|E

5|$|The {{song was}} well {{received}} by critics, {{many of whom}} complimented the lyrics, as well as Carey's vocals. The song was not commercially successful due to its limited release and other factors. The song {{was the center of}} a very public controversy between Carey and her label Sony Music, based on what she perceived to <b>be</b> <b>weak</b> promotion of the single. It peaked at number 40 in Belgium Wallonia, number 45 in Italy and number 65 in the Netherlands. Stateside, due to Billboard rules at the time, it was not eligible to chart on the Hot 100, though it managed to reach number six on the dance chart.|$|E
5|$|When he {{ascended to}} the throne, Pedro II was {{only five years}} old. Until he came of age and {{would be able to}} exert his {{constitutional}} powers, a regency was created. It proved to <b>be</b> <b>weak</b> and to have little effective authority, which led the nation into anarchy, ravaged by political faction struggles and countless rebellions. Exploited as a tool by rival political factions in pursuit of their own interests, Pedro II was manipulated into accepting an early elevation to majority status on 22 July 1840 at age 14, thus putting an end to nine years of chaotic regency rule.|$|E

5|$|At the time, Diệm {{had little}} {{authority}} beyond {{the gates of}} his own palace. Bảo Đại had little confidence in him and gave him meagre support—the pair had clashed in the past, with Diem resigning as Bảo Đại's Interior Minister two decades earlier, believing {{the head of state}} to <b>be</b> <b>weak</b> and ineffective. Many historians believe that Bảo Đại may have selected Diệm for the latter's ability to attract U.S. support and funding. During the transition period, the French Expeditionary Corps maintained a presence in South Vietnam. This led to tension between France and the State of Vietnam. Diệm, a passionate nationalist, detested the French, who reciprocated, hoping he would fail, even calling for his removal on occasions.|$|E
5|$|However, {{given the}} length of time the abuse has been going on, Connie is afraid no one will believe her. The {{assistant}} district attorney assigned to the case, Rhonda Preshutski (Christine Dunford) agrees, believing the case to <b>be</b> <b>weak.</b> Child Protective Services cannot remove Sara from the household until Connie undergoes a psychiatric evaluation, although Black and police lieutenant Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich) investigate the Bangs home to check up on the girl. The father, Joe Bangs (Paul Dooley), chases them off as his wife watches detachedly. Bangs wields a degree of political clout in the community, and pressures the district attorney's office to drop the case. Preshutski is furious with Black over the matter, until it is discovered from Connie's medical exams that Sara is not her sister, but her daughter.|$|E
5|$|Rise of Mana uses an action-based battle system {{similar to}} other entries in the Mana series: {{navigation}} and actions occur in real time within battlefields rendered to the scale of characters within it. After each battle, treasure chests are unlocked which can contain items or new familiars. During battle, the character can attack, switching forms to deliver different attacks, and dodge enemy attacks when correctly timed. During battle, assigned abilities are displayed in the lower right-hand corner of the screen. After each skill is used in battle, a cooldown meter is activated. The skill cannot be used again until the meter is empty. Three types of weapons are available in-game: swords, spears and bows. Each weapon, when equipped, grants a different skill and elemental attribute. The elemental attributes can be used against monsters aligned with a vulnerable element. Enemies can also <b>be</b> <b>weak</b> to attacks using certain weapons. In addition to single-player battles, raid battles allow up to eight players to participate using an online connection.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Bardia {{was fought}} over three days between 3 and 5 January 1941, {{as part of}} Operation Compass, the first {{military}} operation of the Western Desert Campaign of the Second World War. It was the first battle {{of the war in}} which an Australian Army formation took part, the first to be commanded by an Australian general and the first to be planned by an Australian staff. Major General Iven Mackay's 6th Division assaulted the strongly held Italian fortress of Bardia, Libya, assisted by air support and naval gunfire, and under the cover of an artillery barrage. The 16th Infantry Brigade attacked at dawn from the west, where the defences were known to <b>be</b> <b>weak.</b> Sappers blew gaps in the barbed wire with Bangalore torpedoes and filled in and broke down the sides of the anti-tank ditch with picks and shovels. This allowed the infantry and 23 Matilda II tanks of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment to enter the fortress and capture all their objectives, along with 8,000 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Peace did {{not last}} for long, as the {{political}} turmoil in Baghdad continued. In September 941, Ibn Ra'iq assumed once more the post of amir al-umara {{at the invitation of}} Caliph al-Muttaqi (r. 940–944), but he was not as powerful as before. Unable to stop the advance of another strongman, Abu'l-Husayn al-Baridi of Basra, both Ibn Ra'iq and the caliph were forced to abandon Baghdad and seek the help of the Hamdanid ruler of Mosul. The latter soon had Ibn Ra'iq assassinated (April 942) and succeeded him as amir al-umara with the laqab of Nasir al-Dawla. Al-Ikhshid used the opportunity to reoccupy Syria for himself, joining his forces in person in June 942, and venturing as far as Damascus, before returning to Egypt in January 943. The Hamdanids also staked claim on Syria at the same time, but the sources do not record details of their expeditions there. Nasir al-Dawla's position as amir al-umara also proved to <b>be</b> <b>weak,</b> and in June 943 he was ousted by the Turkish general Tuzun. In October, Caliph al-Muttaqi, fearing that Tuzun intended to replace him, fled the capital and sought refuge with the Hamdanids. Although Nasir al-Dawla and his brother Sayf al-Dawla sheltered the caliph, they also did not confront Tuzun's troops, and in May 944 they reached an agreement that gave Upper Mesopotamia and northern Syria to the Hamdanids in exchange for recognizing Tuzun's possession of Iraq. Nasir al-Dawla sent his cousin al-Husayn ibn Sa'id to take over the Syrian provinces allotted to him in this agreement. The Ikhshidid forces either defected or retreated, and al-Husayn swiftly took over the districts of Qinnasrin and Hims.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} merger, Bernhard decided to retire, and {{approached}} Edward Ferman, {{the editor of}} Fantasy and Science Fiction, and Joel Davis, at Ziff-Davis, among others, about a possible sale of Amazing. Jonathan Post, of Emerald City Publishing, believed he had concluded a deal with Bernhard, and began to advertise for submissions, but the negotiations failed. Bernhard also approached George H. Scithers, who declined, but put Bernhard in touch with Gary Gygax of TSR. On 27 May 1982 TSR, Inc. acquired the trademarks and copyrights of Amazing Stories. Scithers was taken on by TSR as editor beginning with the November 1982 issue. He was replaced by Patrick Lucien Price in September 1986, and then by Kim Mohan in May 1991. TSR ceased publication of Amazing with the Winter 1995 issue, but in 1997, shortly after they were acquired by Wizards of the Coast, the magazine was relaunched, again with Mohan as editor. This version lasted for only ten issues, though it did include a special celebratory 600th issue in early 2000. The science fiction trade journal Locus commented in an early review that distribution of the magazine seemed to <b>be</b> <b>weak.</b> The title proved unable to survive: the last issue of this version was dated Summer 2000. The title was then acquired by Paizo Publishing, who launched a new monthly version in September 2004. The February 2005 issue was the last printed; a March 2005 issue was released in PDF format, and in March 2006 Paizo {{announced that it would}} no longer publish Amazing. In September 2011, the trademark for Amazing Stories was acquired by Steve Davidson, and online publication began in 2012 with two issues in July and August.|$|E
