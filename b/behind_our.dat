5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict {{between science and}} religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world {{that there can be no}} common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning <b>behind</b> <b>our</b> metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E

25|$|Though The Peshawar Lancers {{is set in}} 2025, far in {{the future}} from when the novel was published, Stirling does not use 21st century technology. Stirling postulates that without the {{resources}} and innovation of Europe and North America, technological advancement would have been slowed due to the local conditions of the surviving nations. Technology is progressing, though by time of the novel's setting, but still lags <b>behind</b> <b>our</b> level of technology. Air travel is done by hydrogen-lifted airship and motor vehicles are still rare. Plus there are occasional steampunk incursions like Babbage engines. In terms of biology, however, the Raj equals if not surpasses us in some fields.|$|E
25|$|What commends it (Quran) so powerfully to the {{historian}} is its authenticity, {{not as the}} Word of God, of course, as the Muslims believe but as the secular historian cannot and should not, {{but rather as a}} document attesting to what Muhammad said at that time and place, early seventh-century Mecca. It is not a transcript, however; our present Quran is the result of an edition prepared under the orders of Uthman... but the search for significant variants in the partial versions extant before Uthman's standard edition, what can be called the sources <b>behind</b> <b>our</b> text, has not yielded any differences of great significance. Those Uthmanic clues are fragmentary, however, and large 'invented' portions might well have been added to our Quran or authentic material deleted. So it has been charged in fact by some Muslims who failed to find in the present Quran any explicit reference to the designation of a successor to the Prophet and so have alleged tampering with the original texts. But the argument is so patently tendentious and the evidence adduced for the fact so exiguous that few have failed to be convinced that what is in our copy of the Quran is in fact what Muhammad taught, and is expressed in his own words.|$|E

25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} at Saipan, The Mariana Islands, 19 June to 7 July 1944. When his entire company was held up by fire from automatic weapons and small-arms fire from strongly fortified enemy positions that commanded the view of the company, Sgt. (then Pvt.) Baker voluntarily took a bazooka and dashed alone to within 100 yards of the enemy. Through heavy rifle and machine gun fire that was directed at him by the enemy, he knocked out the strong point, enabling his company to assault the ridge. Some days later while his company advanced across the open field flanked with obstructions and places of concealment for the enemy, Sgt. Baker again voluntarily took up a position in the rear to protect the company against a surprise attack and came upon two heavily fortified enemy pockets manned by two officers and ten enlisted men which had been bypassed. Without regard for such superior numbers, he unhesitatingly attacked and killed all of them. Five hundred yards farther, he discovered six men of the enemy who had concealed themselves <b>behind</b> <b>our</b> lines and destroyed all of them. On 7 July 1944, the perimeter of which Sgt. Baker was a part was attacked from 3 sides by from 3,000 to 5,000 Japanese. During the early stages of this attack, Sgt. Baker was severely wounded, but he insisted on remaining in the line and fired at the enemy at ranges sometimes as close as 5 yards until his ammunition ran out. Without ammunition and with his weapon battered to uselessness from hand-to-hand combat, he was carried about 50 yards to the rear by a comrade, who was then himself wounded. At this point Sgt. Baker refused to be moved any further stating that he preferred to be left to die rather than risk the lives of any more of his friends. A short time later, at his request, he was placed in a sitting position against a small tree. Another comrade, withdrawing, offered assistance. Sgt. Baker refused, insisting that he be left alone and be given a soldier's pistol with its remaining eight rounds of ammunition. When last seen alive, Sgt. Baker was propped against a tree, pistol in hand, calmly facing the foe. Later Sgt. Baker's body was found in the same position, gun empty, with 8 Japanese lying dead before him. His deeds were in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Army.|$|E
500|$|The CFA {{investigated}} the incident {{at the request}} of a Singapura breed club. In the investigation, Hal Meadow told the investigation board that the three cats were grandchildren of four local cats he sent back to the US during a previous sensitive business trip to Singapore in 1971, contradicting the Meadows' earlier claim of the foundation cats' origin. Apparently Tommy Meadow lied about it to conceal the secret trip. The CFA found no wrongdoing and kept the Singapura's status as a natural breed. CFA's Joan Miller said that [...] "Whether they mated on the streets of Singapore or whether they mated in Michigan, it doesn't really matter." [...] Referring to the cat picked up from the SPCA in 1981, she said that [...] "In addition, {{there is at least one}} documented cat that is behind many Singapura pedigrees and it was picked up at the pound. Even with none of the cats the Meadows brought in we still have a legitimate cat from Singapore <b>behind</b> <b>our</b> Singapuras." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the record}} crowd {{remained}} after the game as they watched Seattle players and coaches engaged in the post match trophy awarding ceremony and celebrated on the field. [...] In the post match press conference, Sigi Schmid praised his team's defensive efforts in the match, saying [...] "We talked about making sure their defenders – and primarily Pável Pardo – didn’t {{have a chance to}} lift their heads and hit those long balls in behind." [...] Schmid continued, [...] "I thought Evans did a really good job. Sometimes we were stretched in the midfield, but I thought he {{did a very good job}} of stepping up to Pável. When you look at the 90 minutes, it was a rare occasion that he was able to hit a ball <b>behind</b> <b>our</b> defense." [...] Chicago midfielder Logan Pause commented on the game saying, [...] "It’s disappointing. We came here to win. We were under the gun all night. They’re a great team, one of the best in the league. It was a great atmosphere and home field advantage. The better team won tonight unfortunately." ...|$|E

500|$|The New Zealanders {{travelled}} to New York City, {{where they}} played an exhibition game, {{then on to}} San Francisco. There they played two official matches against British Columbia, and won both easily. The tour programme thus ended; New Zealand had played 35 games and lost only once. Gallaher had played in 26 of those matches, including four Tests. Over their 32 matches in the British Isles New Zealand scored 830 points and conceded 39; overall they scored 976 points and conceded only 59. On their arrival back in New Zealand on 6March 1906, the All Blacks were welcomed by a crowd of 10,000 before being hosted at a civic reception in Auckland. Invited {{to speak at the}} reception, Gallaher said: [...] "We did not go <b>behind</b> <b>our</b> back to talk about the Welshman, but candidly said that on that day the better team had won. I have one recommendation to make to the New Zealand [...] Union, if it was to undertake such a tour again, and that is to play the Welsh matches first." ...|$|E
500|$|John McKay gave ex-Steelers quarterback Terry Hanratty {{the start}} against his former team, saying that Hanratty’s {{familiarity}} with the Steelers’ schemes made him the best choice. “I don’t know if I’m doing him a favor or not”, said McKay, who compared the game to Custer’s last stand. Hanratty was pulled in favor of Steve Spurrier in the second half. McKay later told reporters critical of Hanratty’s performance, “You guys should take a Sunday off and play <b>behind</b> <b>our</b> offensive line. They just poured in on us." [...] Rocky Bleier ran for 118 yards and three touchdowns, and Terry Bradshaw completed two touchdown passes to Lynn Swann. Franco Harris, with 55 yards rushing, became the fourth player both to rush for 5,000 yards in four seasons, and to gain 1,000 yards four or more times. The Steelers jumped out to a quick 21–0 lead, helped by two early Tampa Bay turnovers deep in their own territory. Pittsburgh players, some of whom could still remember having gone 0–13 after winning their opener in 1969, described the game as “strange”, but {{declined to comment on}} the Buccaneers’ play. The Buccaneers managed only 85 yards of offense against a Steeler team that needed the win to maintain their playoff chances.|$|E
500|$|In December 2014, Australian {{department}} store Target removed {{the game from}} their 300 stores after customers complained about [...] "depictions of violence against women" [...] and a Change.org petition amassed more than 40,000 signatures. In a public statement, Target corporate affairs manager Jim Cooper said that the decision was reached following [...] "extensive community and customer concern about the game". The same week, another division of Wesfarmers, Kmart Australia, also pulled the game off shelves. Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick publicly expressed the company's disappointment that the game had been pulled from the retailers, and affirmed that he [...] "stand <b>behind</b> <b>our</b> products, the people who create them, and the consumers who play them". IGN's Luke Reilly called the Change.org petition [...] "misinformed", stating that its complaints about incentives for committing sexual violence in the game are untrue; sexual violence in games is forbidden by the Australian Classification Board, and thus the game would have been refused classification. Kotaku's Mark Serrels said that the depiction of women is inherently [...] "problematic", and that Target were within their rights to refuse to stock the game and were obligated {{to respond to the}} petition's wide support. David Keogh of ABC News' The Drum felt that Rockstar depends on controversy and were [...] "burned by the fire they voluntarily decided to play with" [...] since the gaming industry is no longer on the margins of popular culture.|$|E

500|$|When {{football}} season {{arrived in the}} fall, Chappuis {{was one of many}} veterans who returned to college and the gridiron after serving in the war. Many of the returning veterans were not in prime football condition {{at the start of the}} 1946 season, and Coach Fritz Crisler [...] "predicted it might be November before ex-servicemen were adjusted physically and mentally to play their top game." [...] Chappuis later recalled that he was 23years old when he returned to school, and some of the returning veterans [...] "didn't know if they could get back into the rah-rah of college football, but Fritz took care of that. He really whipped us into shape." [...] Despite any difficulties in re-adjusting to civilian life and football, Chappuis broke Otto Graham's Big Nine Conference record for total offensive yards during the 1946 {{football season}}. Though reports differ as to Chappuis' total yards gained, University of Michigan records show that Chappuis gained 1,284yards in 1946—734yards passing, 501yards rushing and 49yards receiving. Chappuis set the new offensive mark in 1946 with a fractured bone in his wrist that he did not report until after the season had ended, at which time an operation was performed. Chappuis later said he knew the x-ray would reveal a fracture, and he would be benched before he even began. He delayed the examination until the season was over because [...] "the time to break into the lineup is prior to the first game. If I hadn't, there were so many capable candidates around who could have made good <b>behind</b> <b>our</b> front wall that I'd never have become a first-stringer by returning in the middle of the season." [...] Accordingly, Chappuis played the 1946 season with a fractured wrist and without even bothering to tape the wrist.|$|E
500|$|Max Mosley, the {{president}} of the FIA, also responded to Schumacher's comments saying that his comments [...] "reflect poorly on the sport and show a lack of adult attitude". Mosley also commented on the weight issue surrounding Schumacher saying that [...] "it is a pity that it became a matter for public discussion, whether he drank a huge amount of water, didn't go to the loo or had a heavy helmet. It is just a pity he didn't take care that it didn't happen". Elf was also unhappy with {{the way in which the}} episode had been handled, the company's Commercial Director Michel Bonnet declaring that [...] "We believe the FIA acted in a high-handed manner in disqualifying our two cars so quickly. It should have declared the results provisional and waited for the results of further analysis. Acting the way it did, the FIA has affected the image of large industrial companies, of top F1 teams and of famous drivers. The fact that we have been treated as cheats by a red team – probably red with embarrassment at having finished one lap <b>behind</b> <b>our</b> cars – and by Gerhard Berger is a serious slur against us." [...] Elf also threatened to take the matter to a tribunal if the cars were not reinstated. Company representative Valerie Jorquera also highlighted the need for a consistent chromatographic analysis of fuel samples, drawing attention to the fact that the samples provided during the event had been analysed by a different company than the reference sample, and that the differences may have been caused by the use of different analytical machines and methods. The incident was seen as unfortunate for the sport, which was trying to make a fresh start after several controversies the previous year. From the San Marino Grand Prix onwards, an FIA mobile fuel laboratory accompanied the teams to each event to permit more detailed testing at the track, in addition to ensuring consistency between events.|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{interpreted}} Song of Songs [...] "My beloved {{is like a}} gazelle or a young hart; behold, {{he stands}} <b>behind</b> <b>our</b> wall," [...] to apply to God's Presence in the synagogue. The Midrash read the words, [...] "behold, He stands <b>behind</b> <b>our</b> wall," [...] to allude to the occasion in [...] when God came to visit Abraham {{on the third day}} after Abraham's circumcision. [...] says, [...] "And the Lord appeared to him by the terebinths of Mamre, as he sat ( [...] , yoshev)..." [...] The word for [...] "he sat" [...] is in a form that can be read yashav, the letter vav being omitted, as though it read that Abraham was sitting before he saw God, but on seeing God, he wanted to stand up. But God told him to sit, as Abraham would serve as a symbol for his children, for when his children would come into their synagogues and houses of study and recite the Shema, they would be sitting down and God's Glory would stand by. To support this reading, the Midrash cited [...] "God stands in the congregation of God." ...|$|E
