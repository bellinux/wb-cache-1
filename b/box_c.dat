40|$|Large {{amounts of}} pp 65 (UL 83) of human {{cytomegalovirus}} are translocated {{to the cell}} nucleus during the first minutes after uptake of the tegument protein from infecting viral particles. Two stretches of basic amino acids which resembled nuclear localization signals (NLS) of both the simian virus 40 type and the bipartite type {{were found in the}} primary structure of pp 65. Deletion of these sequences significantly impaired nuclear localization of the truncated proteins after transient expression. The results indicated that both elements contributed to the nuclear localization of the protein. When fused to the bacterial beta-galactosidase, only one of the two basic elements was sufficient to mediate nuclear translocation. This element consisted of two clusters of basic amino acids (<b>boxes</b> <b>C</b> and D), which were separated by a short spacer sequence. In contrast to other bipartite NLS of animal cells, both basic <b>boxes</b> <b>C</b> and D functioned independently in nuclear transport, thus resembling simian virus 40 -type NLS. Yet, complete translocation of beta-galactosidase was only found in the bipartite configuration. When both <b>boxes</b> <b>C</b> and D were fused, thereby deleting the intervening sequences, the nuclear transport of beta-galactosidase was reduced to levels seen with constructs in which only one of the boxes was present. Appropriate spacing, therefore, was important but not absolutely required. This was in contrast with results for other bipartite NLS, in which spacer deletions led to complete cytoplasmic retention. The presented results demonstrate that efficient nuclear transport of pp 65 is mediated by one dominant NLS and additional targeting sequences. The major NLS of pp 65 is an unusual signal sequence composed of two weak NLS which function together as one strong bipartite nuclear targeting signal...|$|R
40|$|Processing of intron-encoded box C/D small {{nucleolar}} RNAs (snoRNAs) in metazoans {{through both}} the splicing-dependent and -independent pathways requires the conserved core motif formed by <b>boxes</b> <b>C</b> and D and the adjoining 5 '- 3 '-terminal stem. By comparative analysis, {{we found that}} five out of six intron-encoded box C/D snoRNAs in yeast do not possess a canonical terminal stem. Instead, complementary regions within the flanking host intron sequences {{have been identified in}} all these cases. Here we show that these sequences are essential for processing of U 18 and snR 38 snoRNAs and that they compensate for the lack of a canonical terminal stem. We also show that the Rnt 1 p endonuclease, previously shown to be required for the processing of many snoRNAs encoded by monocistronic or polycistronic transcriptional units, is not required for U 18 processing. Our results suggest a role of the complementary sequences in the early recognition of intronic snoRNA substrates and point out the importance of base pairing in favoring the communication between <b>boxes</b> <b>C</b> and D at the level of pre-snoRNA molecules for efficient assembly with snoRNP-specific factors...|$|R

50|$|Miller-Pence Farm is a {{historic}} home and farm located near Greenville, Monroe County, West Virginia. The main farmhouse was built in 1828, with five modifications through 1910.

A two-story addition dated to the 1880s, with a cut stone foundation, has board-and-batten siding, evoking the Carpenter Gothic architectural style. Also on the property are a former slave school (c. 1870), second school (c. 1870), three barns (c. 1880-1920), tractor shed (c. 1920), equipment shed (c. 1930), corn crib and ruins of Miller's Frontier House (c. 1770), spring <b>box</b> (<b>c.</b> 1778), original road cut (c. 1800), and the Miller-Halstead Cemetery (c. 1775).|$|E

In this study, we generated fusion proteins consisting of the A <b>box</b> and <b>C</b> tail, in which the B box was deleted and the A <b>box</b> and <b>C</b> tail were linked either directly or by the flexible linker sequence (Gly 4 Ser) 3.

40|$|U 14 is one {{of several}} {{nucleolar}} small nuclear RNAs required for normal processing of rRNA. Functional mapping of U 14 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has yielded a number of mutants defective in U 14 accumulation or function. In this study, we have further defined three structural elements required for U 14 accumulation. The essential elements include the U 14 -conserved <b>box</b> <b>C</b> and box D sequences and a 5 ', 3 ' terminal stem. The box elements are coconserved among several nucleolar small nuclear RNAs and have been implicated in binding of the protein fibrillarin. New mutational results show that the first GA bases of the <b>box</b> <b>C</b> sequence UGAUGA are essential, and two vital bases in box D have also been identified. An intragenic suppressor of a lethal <b>box</b> <b>C</b> mutant has been isolated and shown to contain a new box C-like PyGAUG sequence two bases upstream of normal <b>box</b> <b>C.</b> The importance of the terminal stem was confirmed from new compensatory base changes and the finding that accumulation defects in the box elements can be complemented by extending the terminal stem. The results suggest that the observed defects in accumulation reflect U 14 instability and that protein binding to {{one or more of these}} elements is required for metabolic stability...|$|E

Peripheral blood leukocytes and buccal mucosal epithelial cells were obtained from seven members of a family with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome.

40|$|The 5 ′-cap {{structure}} of most spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and certain small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) undergoes hypermethylation from a 7 -methylguanosine to a 2, 2, 7 -trimethylguanosine structure. 5 ′-Cap hypermethylation of snRNAs {{is dependent upon}} a conserved sequence element known as the Sm site common to most snRNAs. Here we have performed a mutational analysis of U 3 and U 14 to determine the cis-acting sequences required for 5 ′-cap hypermethylation of Box C/D snoRNAs. We have found that both the conserved sequence elements <b>Box</b> <b>C</b> (termed C′ in U 3) and Box D are necessary for cap hypermethylation. Furthermore, the terminal stem structure that is formed by sequences that flank <b>Box</b> <b>C</b> (C′ in U 3) and Box D is also required. However, mutation of other conserved sequences {{has no effect on}} hypermethylation of the cap. Finally, the analysis of fragments of U 3 and U 14 RNAs indicates that the Box C/D motif, including <b>Box</b> <b>C</b> (C′ in U 3), Box D and the terminal stem, is capable of directing cap hypermethylation. Thus, the Box C/D motif, which is important for snoRNA processing, stability, nuclear retention, protein binding, nucleolar localization and function, is also necessary and sufficient for cap hypermethylation of these RNAs...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{investigations}} have identified homologs of eukaryotic box C/D small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) in Archaea termed sRNAs. Archaeal homologs {{of the box}} C/D snoRNP core proteins fibrillarin and Nop 56 / 58 have also been identified but a homolog for the eukaryotic 15. 5 kD snoRNP protein has not been described. Our sequence analysis of archaeal genomes reveals that the highly conserved ribosomal protein L 7 exhibits extensive homology with the eukaryotic 15. 5 kD protein. Protein binding studies demonstrate that recombinant Methanoccocus jannaschii L 7 protein binds the box C/D snoRNA core motif with the same specificity and affinity as the eukaryotic 15. 5 kD protein. Identical to the eukaryotic 15. 5 kD core protein, archaeal L 7 requires a correctly folded box C/D core motif and intact <b>boxes</b> <b>C</b> and D. Mutational analysis demonstrates that critical features of the box C/D core motif essential for 15. 5 kD binding are also required for L 7 interaction. These include stem I which juxtaposes <b>boxes</b> <b>C</b> and D, {{as well as the}} sheared G:A pairs and protruded pyrimidine nucleotide of the asymmetric bulge region.
