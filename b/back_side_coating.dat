30|$|Surface {{morphology}} of the spin-coated samples on the GaAs substrates {{was investigated}} by a Nanoscope V Multimode Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) provided by Veeco Instrument. To minimize the sample damage, AFM imaging {{was performed in}} tapping mode, and observations were made with the AFM instrument placed on vibration isolation VT- 102 table {{in order to minimize}} the effects of vibration. The measurements were taken at well-stabilized room temperature to avoid thermal drift. During the imaging, both the scan rate and the imaging resolution were set at 0.2 Hz and 512 pixels, respectively. Ultra-high resolution tungsten tips purchased from Micro Masch with tip radius < 1 nm and <b>back</b> <b>side</b> <b>coated</b> with aluminum were used for the AFM experiments. All tips had a force constant of 75 N/m and a resonance frequency of 400 kHz.|$|R
40|$|Optical {{properties}} of metal island films (MIFs) {{can be combined}} with interference of dielectric coatings. A set of multilayer designs containing metal clusters reflecting different colours from front and <b>back</b> <b>side</b> of the <b>coating</b> was obtained by numerical optimization. The chosen designs presenting the range of feasible colours were deposited by electron beam evaporation. Spectrophotometric and ellipsometric measurements verified that the produced coatings present an excellent agreement with the optical performance calculated from the designs. Numerical optimization was verified as a useful method in designing of coatings containing MIFs. This approach can ease the implementation of metal clusters into multilayer designs and broaden the applications of MIFs...|$|R
40|$|A {{mixture of}} {{dispersed}} metal in a dielectric matrix, a so-called cermet, offers {{the possibility of}} tailoring the refractive index. Combined with a reflector on the <b>back</b> <b>side,</b> an interference <b>coating</b> with a spectrally selective reflectance suitable for solar absorbers can be made high 1, 2. The solar absorptance of a cermet with a homogeneous metal distribution {{is limited by the}} reflectance losses due to its high refractive index. These losses can be reduced in different ways. The so-called graded cermets have a monotone varying filling factor of the metal, decreasing from the substrate mirror {{to the front of the}} coating, causing a gradient in the refractive index. Such coatings can be thicker without increasing the thermal emittance too much high 3, because of the relatively low content of dielectric. Another method for the reduction of the reflectance losses is the roughening of the interfaces high 4, 5. The dimension of such a micro roughness should be optimized in order to achieve a h igh solar absorptance without a high enhancement of the IR-emittance and a strong disturbance of the interference. The optical properties of aluminium and aluminium oxide as well as the costs of these materials seem very promising for application in solar energy conversion...|$|R
40|$|Aligned {{polymeric}} nanofibers obtained via electrospinning were sputter-coated with metals on {{both their}} front and <b>back</b> <b>sides.</b> When both <b>sides</b> were <b>coated</b> {{with the same}} metal (gold, silver or plat- inum/palladium alloy), the nanofibers behaved as pure conductors. However, coating front and back of the fibers with different metals causes a potential difference when they are immersed in an aqueous solution. This potential difference propelled the Janus fibers in the direction perpendicular to their long axis when hydrogen peroxide was present in the solution. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} novel method for {{fabrication}} of dou-ble <b>side</b> <b>coated</b> wafers by back-to-back Direct Wafer Bond-ing (DWB). Two 3 inch sapphire wafers (R-cut) were coated each with YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 −δ by laser ablation on one side. The wafers were then directly bonded with their uncoated sides {{together in a}} microcleanroom. Subsequent heating increased the bond energy up to energies sufficient for fabrication of hybrid devices working at cryogenic temperatures. TEM cross sections reveal direct contact of the two sapphire lat-tices.
