5|$|Congestion pricing remains highly {{controversial}} {{with the public}} {{both before and after}} implementation. This has in part been resolved through referendums, such as after the seven-month trial period in Stockholm; however this creates a debate as to where the <b>border</b> <b>line</b> for the referendum should go, since it is often the people living outside the urban area who have to pay the tax, while the external benefit is granted those who live within the area. In Stockholm there was a majority in the referendum within the city border (where the votes counted), but not outside.|$|E
5|$|In March 1914, the Northern Epirote Declaration of Independence was {{announced}} in Gjirokastër and it was confirmed in the Protocol of Corfu. The Republic, however, was short-lived, as Albania collapsed {{at the beginning of}} World War I. The Greek military returned in October–November 1914, and again captured Gjirokastër, along with Saranda and Korçë. In April 1916, the territory referred to by Greeks as Northern Epirus, including Gjirokastër, was annexed to Greece. The Paris Peace Conference, 1919 restored the pre-war status quo, essentially upholding the <b>border</b> <b>line</b> decided in the 1913 Protocol of Florence, and the city was again returned to Albanian control.|$|E
5|$|On the West German side, {{there were}} no fortifications of any kind, nor even any patrol roads in most areas. Warning signs (Grenzschilder) with {{messages}} such as Achtung! Zonengrenze! ("Danger! Zonal border!") or Halt! Hier Zonengrenze ("Stop! Zonal border here") notified visitors. Foreign military personnel were restricted from approaching the border to avoid clashes or other unwanted incidents. Signs in English and German provided notifications of {{the distance to the}} border to prevent accidental crossings. No such restriction applied to Western civilians, who were free {{to go up to the}} <b>border</b> <b>line,</b> and {{there were no}} physical obstacles to stop their crossing it.|$|E

5|$|The first local elections, {{based on}} {{universal}} suffrage in Finland were held during 17–28 December 1918 {{and the first}} free Parliamentary election after the Civil War on 3 March 1919. The United States and the United Kingdom recognised Finnish sovereignty on 6–7 May 1919. The Western powers demanded establishment of democratic republics in post-war Europe in order to calm down the widespread revolutionary movements in Europe. The Finnish-Russian Treaty of Tartu signed on 14 October 1920 aimed to stabilize the political relations and settle the <b>border</b> <b>line</b> between the former Grand Duchy and its mainland.|$|E
5|$|Simeon often {{violated}} {{the peace treaty}} with Byzantium, attacking and conquering Byzantine territory on several occasions, such as in 904, when the Bulgarian raids were used by Arabs led by the Byzantine renegade Leo of Tripoli to undertake a maritime campaign and seize Thessaloniki. After the Arabs plundered the city, {{it was an easy}} target for Bulgaria and the nearby Slavic tribes. In order to dissuade Simeon from capturing the city and populating it with Slavs, Leo VI was forced to make further territorial concessions to the Bulgarians in the modern region of Macedonia. With the treaty of 904, all Slavic-inhabited lands in modern southern Macedonia and southern Albania were ceded to the Bulgarian Empire, with the <b>border</b> <b>line</b> running some 20 kilometres north of Thessaloniki.|$|E
5|$|The {{borders in}} the region had been disputed since the American {{purchase}} of Alaska from Russia in 1867, {{and most of the}} influx of prospectors were American. Amid fresh concerns that the United States might annex the gold fields, the mounted police were tasked to assert Canadian control along the <b>border</b> <b>line.</b> The force set up control posts at the borders of the Yukon and at easily controlled mountain passes, equipping the posts with Maxim guns. The police checked for illegal weapons and prevented the entry of criminals and collected customs duties, while helping protect and guide the flow of migrants, mediating in their disputes and providing practical advice.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} land border {{disputes}} between Croatia and Serbia. The two countries presently control one {{bank of the}} present-day river each, but Croatia claims that the <b>border</b> <b>line</b> should follow the cadastral borders between the former municipalities of SR Croatia and SR Serbia along the Danube, as defined by a Yugoslav commission in 1947 (effectively following a former river bed); borders claimed by Croatia also include the Vukovar and Šarengrad islands in the Danube as its territory. There is also a border dispute with Bosnia–Herzegovina, specifically Croatia claims Unčica channel on the right bank of Una as the border at Hrvatska Kostajnica, while Bosnia and Herzegovina claims Una River course as the border there.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{between the}} Song and Liao {{remained}} tense and hostile: in 986 the Song sent three armies against the Liao {{in an effort}} to take advantage of an infant emperor and recapture the Sixteen Prefectures, but the Liao successfully repulsed all three armies. Following this, diplomatic relations were resumed. Relations between Song and Liao worsened in the 990s. From 993 to 1004, the Liao observed the Song as the latter built a 'Great Ditch' in northern Hebei province from the Taihang Mountains in the west {{all the way to the}} Bohai Sea in the east. This was essentially a series of canals meant to block the advance of Liao cavalry far from the northern <b>border</b> <b>line,</b> although the Liao perceived this engineering project as a means for the Song to dispatch offensive forces more efficiently via new waterways. In 999 the Liao began annual attacks on Song positions, though with no breakthrough victories. The Liao were interested in capturing the Guannan region of northern Hebei, both because the Song general Zhou Shizong had taken it from them and because it contained strategic passes.|$|E
5|$|Wanyan Liang {{established}} a military {{campaign against the}} Southern Song in 1161, with 70,000 naval troops aboard 600 warships facing a smaller Song fleet of only 120 warships and 3,000 men. At the Battle of Tangdao and the Battle of Caishi along the Yangtze River, Jin forces were defeated by the Southern Song navy. In these battles, the Jin navy was wiped out by the much smaller Song fleet because of their use of fast paddle-wheel crafts and gunpowder bombs launched from trebuchet catapults (since explosive grenades and bombs had been known in China since the 10th century). Meanwhile, two simultaneous rebellions of Jurchen nobles, led by soon-to-be crowned Jin emperor Wanyan Yong and Khitan tribesman, erupted in Manchuria. This forced the reluctant Jin court to withdraw its troops from southern China to quell these uprisings. In the end, Wanyan Liang failed in taking the Southern Song and was assassinated by his own generals in December 1161. The Khitan uprising was not suppressed until 1164, while the Treaty of Longxing (隆興和議) was signed in 1165 between Song and Jin, reestablishing the 1142 <b>border</b> <b>line</b> and ushering in four decades of peace between the two.|$|E

5|$|While Rowan {{was still}} a justice of the Court of Appeals, the General Assembly chose him and John J. Crittenden as commissioners to resolve a border dispute with Tennessee. The dispute had arisen from an {{erroneous}} survey of the <b>border</b> <b>line</b> conducted by Dr. Thomas Walker years earlier. Walker's line deviated northward from the intended line (36 degrees, 30 minutes north latitude) by some twelve miles {{by the time it}} reached the Tennessee River. The Tennessee commissioners, Felix Grundy and William L. Brown, proposed that, because it had been accepted for so long, the Walker line be observed as far west as the Tennessee River, with Kentucky being compensated with a more southerly line between the Tennessee and Mississippi Rivers. Crittenden was inclined to accept this proposal with some minor adjustments, but Rowan insisted that Tennessee honor the statutory border of 36 degrees, 30 minutes north. The Tennessee commissioners refused to submit to arbitration in the matter, and Rowan and Crittenden delivered separate reports to the Kentucky legislature. The legislature adopted Crittenden's report; Rowan then resigned as commissioner and was replaced by Robert Trimble. Thereafter, the commissioners quickly agreed to a slightly modified version of the Tennessee proposal.|$|E
25|$|In 1925 the Permanent Court of International Justice {{took over}} the disputed <b>border</b> <b>line</b> issue and, in December 1925, adopted a {{resolution}} which refused {{the idea of the}} Assyrian's return to Hakkâri and gave that region to Turkey, while giving Mosul to Iraq and settling on a <b>border</b> <b>line</b> almost matching the same status quo line which was called the Brussels Line.

This resulted in Norway and the Soviet Union no longer having a common border. The planned 1921 review was not carried out. A treaty regarding the border was signed between Finland and Norway on 28 April 1924, replacing the 1826 treaty, but not changing the <b>border</b> <b>line.</b> A review {{was carried out in}} 1925.

25|$|From the 11th century Olaf III of Norway {{regarded}} {{the borders of}} Norway as reaching to the White Sea. The first Norwegians started moving to Finnmark in the 13th century. Vardøhus Fortress was erected by Norway in 1300 further east than today's land border, supporting Norwegian land ownership on the Varanger Peninsula. There were no permanent Norwegian settlements on the Kola Peninsula. In 1326 Norway and the Novgorod Republic signed an agreement regarding taxation of the Kola Peninsula and Finnmark. No <b>border</b> <b>line</b> was drawn, creating a marchland where both countries held the right to taxation of the Sami. Religiously motivated Russian colonization of the jointly taxed areas started in the 16th century, and Russian-Orthodox chapels were built at Neiden, Pechenga and Boris Gleb. This accelerated {{the need for a}} specific <b>border</b> <b>line.</b> In 1582 Russian Tsar Ivan the Terrible declared the Kola Bay part of Russia, later specifying that Russia claimed all of Lapland. He further proposed that a new <b>border</b> <b>line</b> be drawn up. Denmark–Norway's King Frederick II responded by renewing the Norwegian claim to all land to the White Sea. His successor Christian IV traveled along the Finnmark coast in 1599 to increase the weight of the claims. As part of the Treaty of Knäred in 1613, Sweden abandoned all claims in Finnmark.|$|E
25|$|Rapid {{access to}} {{all parts of the}} <b>border</b> <b>line</b> was {{required}} to ensure a quick response to escape attempts.
