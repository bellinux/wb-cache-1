Based on this list, {{information on the}} frequency and the intensity with which people recall <b>being</b> laughed <b>at</b> during a given time-span (12 months in this study) can be collected. An empirical study (N = 114) examined {{the relations between the}} LDS and the fear of <b>being</b> laughed <b>at</b> (gelotophobia), the joy of <b>being</b> laughed <b>at</b> (gelotophilia), and the joy of laughing at others (katagelasticism; Ruch and Proyer this issue). More than 92 % of the participants recalled having been laughed at at least once over the past 12 months. Highest scores were found for experiencing an embarrassing situation, chauvinism of others or <b>being</b> laughed <b>at</b> for doing something awkward or clumsy. Gelotophobia, gelotophilia, and katagelasticism were related about equally to the recalled frequency of events of <b>being</b> laughed <b>at</b> (with the lowest relation to katagelasticism). Gelotophobia, gelotophilia, and katagelasticism yielded a distinct and plausible pattern of correlations to the frequency of events of <b>being</b> laughed <b>at.</b> Gelotophobes recalled the situations of <b>being</b> laughed <b>at</b> with a higher intensity than others.
