5000|$|Burnishing is {{the wearing}} or mating of {{opposing}} surfaces. When the armature and rotor or <b>brake</b> <b>faces</b> are produced, the faces are machined {{as flat as}} possible. (Some manufacturers also lightly grind the faces to get them smoother.) But even with that the machining process leaves peaks and valleys {{on the surface of}} the steel. When a new [...] "out of the box" [...] coupling is initially engaged most peaks on both mating surfaces touch which means that the potential contact area can be significantly reduced. In some cases, an out of box coupling can have only 50% of its torque rating.|$|R
50|$|The process {{involves}} {{cycling the}} coupling {{a number of}} times at a lower inertia, lower speed or a combination of both. Burnishing can require anywhere from 20 to over 100 cycles depending upon the size of a coupling and the amount of initial torque required. For bearing mounted couplings, where the rotor and armature are connected and held in place via a bearing, burnishing does not have to take place on the machine. It can be done individually on a bench or in a group burnishing station. If a clutch has a separate armature and rotor (two piece unit) burnishing is done as a matched set, to make sure proper torque is achieved. Similarly, two-piece brakes that have separate armatures should be burnished on a machine rather than a bench because any change in the mounting tolerance as that brake is mounted to the machine may shift the alignment so the burnishing lines on the armature, rotor or <b>brake</b> <b>face</b> may be off, slightly preventing that brake from achieving full torque. Again, the difference is only slight so this would only be required in a very torque sensitive application.|$|R
2500|$|Run-out is {{measured}} using {{a dial indicator}} on a fixed rigid base, with the tip perpendicular to the <b>brake</b> disc's <b>face.</b> It is typically measured about [...] from the outside diameter of the disc. The disc is spun. The difference between minimum and maximum value on the dial is called lateral run-out. Typical hub/disc assembly run-out specifications for passenger vehicles are around [...] Runout can be caused either by deformation of the disc itself or by runout in the underlying wheel hub face or by contamination between the disc surface and the underlying hub mounting surface. Determining {{the root cause of}} the indicator displacement (lateral runout) requires disassembly of the disc from the hub. Disc face runout due to hub face runout or contamination will typically have a period of 1 minimum and 1 maximum per revolution of the brake disc.|$|R

Sonic the Hedgehog, the series' main character, is the game's only player character. He is controlled exclusively with the Wii Remote, which is held horizontally like a traditional gamepad. Players adjust his forward movement by tilting the controller. He runs along a predesignated path; players jump and <b>brake</b> using corresponding <b>face</b> buttons.

40|$|The {{developers}} of innovative automotive active systems have recently stimulated new interest toward {{the analysis of}} the frictional behaviour of brake and clutch facings. This paper presents the experimental results acquired with a laboratory setup on <b>brake</b> and clutch <b>facing</b> samples in sliding motion for different operating conditions. An artificial neural network has been used to obtain a comprehensive view of the influence of the main sliding parameters. The study has also taken into account the not weak influence of the sliding acceleration to improve the friction coefficient prediction during transient operations of these dry friction based devices...|$|R
40|$|Presses Universitaires de la Méditerranée, Montpellier. International audienceIn France, coastal risk {{management}} is based now on principles that denounce the traditional temptation of using static structures {{to defend the}} coast. These principles lean on the adaptation of coastal protections to the stakes and on comparison between {{costs and benefits of}} defenses. However, excepted some particular cases, examples taken on the french coasts show there is a large way between the doctrine and the application of its principles. Facing risks of flooding and coastal erosion, coastal atlternative solutions are unusually used. However large coastal engeneering structures are not systematicaly applicated.

60|$|By noon he had {{rounded the}} wide {{curve of the}} <b>brake</b> and was <b>facing</b> south. The bluff had petered out from a high, mountainous wall to a low {{abutment}} of rock, but it still held to its steep, rough nature and afforded no crack or slope where quick ascent could have been possible. He pushed on, growing warier {{as he approached the}} danger-zone, finding that as he neared the river on this side it was imperative to go deeper into the willows. In the afternoon he reached a point where he could see men pacing to and fro on the bluff. This assured him that whatever place was guarded was one by which he might escape. He headed toward these men and approached to within a hundred paces of the bluff where they were. There were several men and several boys, all armed and, after the manner of Texans, taking their task leisurely. Farther down Duane made out black dots on the horizon of the bluff-line, and these he concluded were more guards stationed at another outlet. Probably all the available men in the district were on duty. Texans took a grim pleasure in such work. Duane remembered that upon several occasions he had served such duty himself.|$|R
5000|$|Currently {{only three}} freight railroads, Union Pacific, Florida East Coast and CSX Transportation, have adopted {{any form of}} ATC on their own networks. The systems on both FEC and CSX work in {{conjunction}} with pulse code cab signals, which {{in the case of}} CSX was inherited from the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac railroad on its single main line. Union Pacific's was inherited on portions of the Chicago and Northwestern east-west main line and works in conjunction with an early two aspect cab signaling system designed for use with ATC. On CSX and FEC more restrictive cab signal changes require the engineer to initiate a minimum <b>brake</b> application or <b>face</b> a more severe penalty application that will bring the train to a stop. Neither system requires explicit speed control or adherence to a braking curve. [...] The Union Pacific system requires an immediate brake application that cannot be released until the train's speed has been reduced to 40 mph (for any train traveling above that speed). Then, the train's speed must be further reduced to no more than 20 mph within 70 seconds of the initial cab signal drop. Failure to apply the brakes for these speed reductions will result in a penalty application.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Carbon fibre reinforced ceramic composites (Cf/C-SiC) have been explored as lightweight and durable disc in a friction brake. This composite was manufactured through infiltration of liquid silicon into a Cf/C perform. It has heterogeneous microstructure, composed of three key phases, silicon carbide, Cf/C, and un-reacted residual silicon. The development of the transfer layer on the friction surface of Cf/C-SiC was studied through microstructural image registration of the surface after a range of braking stops on a laboratory-scale dynamometer test rig. When an organic pad {{was used as the}} counter <b>face</b> <b>brake</b> pad, it was found that a steady transfer layer was developed in silicon regions right after initial stops; in carbon-fibre/carbon (Cf/C) regions and most of the silicon carbide region, the friction surfaces were unsteady and any possible friction transfer layers were hardly built up. Large voids and cracks/crevices likely became pools to quickly and efficiently collect the transferred materials generated by the friction, but the compacts formed inside the pools were susceptible to be stripped off by further braking operation. Three types of friction surfaces were generalized: type I, the friction transfer layer had a steady relationship with the matrix and respectable longevity; type II, the transfer layer had an unstable relationship with the matrix and poor durability; type III, the friction transfer layer had a steady relationship with the matrix but short lifetime. After testing against organic pads under the laboratory scale dynamometer testing condition, the friction surface of each key phase in Cf/C-SiC composites disc was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was found that the transfer layer developed on Si consists of fine particles of metal silicides, silicates and minerals. The substrate damage of Si was not observed, while the precipitates having high oxygen content were found in the substrate. Formation of an interfacial bonding between transfer layer and silicon substrate {{is believed to be the}} key factor for the formation of a stable transfer layer on Si. However, the interfacial bonding between transferred materials and SiC was not detected. Kinks are common features developed on the friction surface of SiC. The interface between carbon fibre and carbon matrix was experienced mechanical damage, in form of microcracks, and the transferred material was developed in the interface. Instead of transfer layer, a thin amorphous film, produced by friction induced amorphisation of carbon fibre, was developed on top of carbon fibre...|$|R
