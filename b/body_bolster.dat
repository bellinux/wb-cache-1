50|$|During this period, {{many of the}} Gate Stock cars on the Central {{line had}} been {{converted}} to air-door operation by the Union Construction Co., which was based at Feltham. Plans were briefly formulated to convert the Gate Stock on the Piccadilly and Bakerloo lines, but analysis showed {{that the cost of}} building a new car was only slightly more than the cost of converting an old one, and so an order for 182 new cars was placed. They were known as the 1927 Feltham Stock, although the door plates carried the date 1928, and they were not delivered until 1929 and 1930. The lightweight construction caused problems in later years, when the seat risers and <b>body</b> <b>bolsters</b> developed fractures. With the batch of cars built by MCWF and fitted with BTH equipment, these vehicles enabled Gate Stock to be withdrawn from the Piccadilly line in June 1929, and from the Bakerloo line on 1 January 1930.|$|R

Edwin did not have such burns on his <b>body.</b> This <b>bolstered</b> the suicide theory, for such rapid drinking suggested that the drinker rushed the poisoned drink down. When the jury returned to court after considering its verdict the foreman said: [...] "although we think gravesuspicion is attached to the prisoner, we do not think there is sufficient evidence to show how or by whom the chloroform was administered." [...] The foreman then confirmed that the verdict was not guilty, which was greeted with [...] "rapturous applause", public opinion having moved in Adelaide's favour {{during the course of the}} trial.|$|R

5000|$|The DOT-111 tank {{cars are}} {{constructed}} with a draft sill design. Draft sills incorporate the draft gear behind each coupler {{that is designed}} to transfer longitudinal draft (tension) and buff (compression) forces throughout the length of a train. The draft sills are attached to steel pads that are attached to the tank. If the cars do not incorporate a continuous center sill extending {{the entire length of the}} car, the two draft sills at each end are referred to as stub sills, and the tank carries draft forces between couplers. In this case, reinforcing bars may be extended underneath the tank between the draft sills. Body bolsters and their associated <b>body</b> <b>bolster</b> pads centered above the railcar trucks support the tank and protect it against lateral forces. The draft sill center plate serves as the attachment point between the tank car body and the truck assembly. (See schematic cutaway at right.) ...|$|E

The works also had a short test track electrified at 750 V DC or 25 kV AC.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is part of}} the Vision of the Dolls: Theorizing technology, identity and agency in Joss Whedon’s Dollhouse track. Joss Whedon’s Dollhouse is filled with actives (rather than agents) who take up various engagements (rather than projects), guided by imprints (rather than identities). In this paper, I examine the connections between selfhood and responsibility at work in the show, discuss how the ‘dolls’ compel re-conceptions of authentic selfhood, and argue that the series can support rich conceptions of agency as embodied. The question of responsibility in the dollhouse is challenging: it is unclear to what extent the dolls can be held responsible for their actions given that they largely lack control over their decisions and behaviour, even while viewers are reminded of their ambiguous role in arriving at the house. Issues of the dolls’ moral agency become more compelling when we ask questions from different angles: 1) To what extent can the dolls’ selfhoods sustain agency and responsibility? In what ways does the series encourage us to view Caroline/Echo as not responsible for most actions during engagements, while still being responsible in a forward-looking sense for subverting the injustice at work in the ‘house’? 2) What conceptions of authenticity underlie the kind of self we take to be necessary for responsibility? How can the ambiguity of dolls’ possibilities for responsibility loosen the traditional sense that I need to be my authentic self (‘the real me’) in order to be responsible? 3) How might the series’ emphasis on the dolls’ <b>bodies</b> <b>bolster</b> new feminist inquiries into embodied agency? I suggest that the dolls’ bodies provide {{some of the most important}} areas for discussion. Reading the various representations of scarring and tattooing as drives to ‘authenticate’ (i. e., my body and its marks will indicate who I genuinely am and always have been, even when I do not or cannot identify with it), I argue that efforts to authenticate selves by the permanence of bodies is troubling in its assumption that the authentic self must be established at birth, not fundamentally alterable (no matter how much wiping and imprinting), and in need of rigid identification. Having said this, dolls’ bodies are also used in a more promising way to flesh out the physicality of memory, identity, and most importantly for my purposes, responsibility – we come to see the dolls’ bodies as holding the greatest promise for stopping harm and implementing change...|$|R
50|$|The Mozambique Drill is {{intended}} {{to ensure that the}} target is immediately stopped, by first placing two shots into the larger, easier-to-hit mass of the upper body, then, if the target is still active, following with a third, more precisely aimed and difficult head shot. Due to factors such as <b>body</b> armor, the <b>bolstering</b> effect of drugs, or failure to hit vital organs, the body shots may not be immediately effective, necessitating the third shot. To guarantee instant incapacitation by impacting the brain and central nervous system, the head shot must be delivered to the area between eyebrows and upper lip, otherwise, various bony areas of the skull could deflect the bullet.|$|R

40|$|A rigid wall {{model has}} been used widely in the {{numerical}} simulation of rail vehicle impacts. Finite element impact modelling of rail vehicles is generally based on a half-width and full-length or half-length structure, depending on the symmetry. The structure and components of rail vehicles are normally designed to cope with proof loading to ensure adequate ride performance. In this paper, the authors present a study of a rail {{vehicle with driving cab}} focused on improving the modelling approach and exploring the intrinsic structural weaknesses to enhance its crashworthiness. The underpinning research used finite element analysis and compared the behaviour of the rail vehicle in different impact scenarios. It was found that the simulation of a rigid wall impact can mask structural weaknesses; that even a completely symmetrical impact may lead to an asymmetrical result; that downward bending is an intrinsic weakness of conventional rail vehicles and that a rigid part of the vehicle structure, such as the <b>body</b> <b>bolster,</b> may cause uncoordinated deformation and shear fracture between the vehicle sections. These findings have significance for impact simulation, the full-scale testing of rail vehicles and rail vehicle design in general...|$|E
30|$|Considering the {{hazardous}} nature of high-speed train operation, {{the assessment of}} vehicle reliability is essential to guarantee its safe operation. It is therefore necessary to assess the reliability of key components in high-speed trains, which represent issues that have been widely and thoroughly studied. Meng et al. [22] researched a reliability evaluation method using Markov model to describe the trend of the system reliability, and assessed the reliability of high-speed train traction transmission system. However, the system reliability needs research component reliability, which is statistical inference under small sample problem. Wang et al. [23] employed the least squares method to analyze {{the reliability of the}} key components of trains based on the Weibull distribution. The results of the study indicated that the sample size had a significant effect on the estimation precision. Wu et al. [24] assessed the reliability of relay valves based on the characteristic that the failure rate gradually increases according to an assumed Weibull distribution. Wang et al. [25] performed a durable test to evaluate the reliability of a brake unit for urban rail vehicles. The methods discussed above for the reliability assessment of high-speed trains can achieve satisfactory results under large sample size. Tian [26] employed a virtual expansion method to expand data sample size from n[*]=[*] 2 – 3 to n[*]=[*] 12, and then employed the method to analyze the reliability of the center sill and <b>body</b> <b>bolster</b> of a C 70 gondola car based on a Bayesian method. The authors assumed that the lifetimes of parts followed normal distributions, and the approach was demonstrated to improve the assessment precision. Zhu et al. [27] extended the Bayesian method to the Weibull distribution, and verified the robustness of the model by assessing the reliability of bearings in a high-speed train. Subjective selection was employed to define the prior distribution and its hyperparameters, and these estimators were solved using an analytical method. Dong [28] assessed the reliability of braking systems in urban railway vehicles using a goal-oriented (GO) methodology and Bayesian theory based on the assumption of an exponential distribution. The method was demonstrated to be suitable for analyzing conditions where a component follows the rule that the failure rate is constant. Akama [29] calculated the crack propagation rate of cracks in a Shinkansen vehicle axle using Bayesian analysis by combining crack propagation rates derived from small specimens with crack propagation rates derived from full-scale models. The results showed that the method can narrow the variance of the fatigue life distribution, and provide more confident failure probability values.|$|E
40|$|Since the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s {{opinion in}} Batson v. Kentucky, {{the rules and}} tools {{available}} to lawyers for selecting juries have changed dramatically from {{what they had been}} for decades in American courtrooms. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s well intentioned effort in Batson to attempt to eliminate racial discrimination from the process of jury selection set in motion a series of modifications in lawyer decision making which have changed how lawyers fill the jury box. Prior to Batson, the sacrosanct tool known as the peremptory challenge had been virtually unassailable as a jury selection weapon. Abuses by prosecutors, particularly in the southern United States, had prompted concerns that some improper uses of the challenge should be easier to prove. Batson provided more flexibility by lowering the 2 ̆ 2 crippling burden of proof 2 ̆ 2 that had existed for many years. In doing so, however, the Court has raised serious questions about the proper role of juries and the responsibilities of lawyers as both attempt to do their job making important decisions in the justice process. In the decade that followed the Batson decision, the Court spawned a number of opinions that have made the rules of jury selection so difficult to understand that even a lawyer who ethically seeks to follow the law may have considerable problems deciding what the law will permit. This circumstance has been further complicated by how the Batson rules affect a lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s obligation to attempt to select the best possible jury to hear the case on behalf of his client. The lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s ethical obligation to be a zealous advocate will often place him in direct conflict with the current jury selection law. Indeed, Batson and its progeny have developed into a system of rules that not only encourage, but often require, lawyers attempting to select juries to lie to judges, clients, other lawyers, and even to themselves as they navigate the conflicting goals presented on the roily waters of jury selection. This Article is an attempt to address the ethical tragedies that have been created by a system that encourages lawyers to manufacture better race-neutral reasons for why they have excluded a particular juror. A lawyer may engage in this enterprise whether he is trying to intentionally disguise illegal conduct or merely attempting to assure that he is not perceived as engaging in improper jury selection practices. Either way, the legal profession can ill afford to further erode the public 2 ̆ 7 s confidence in its integrity and honesty. In my view, a system that creates this kind of dishonesty is at least as costly as the system of racial or gender discrimination that the rules seek to avoid; especially when there are better alternatives to resolve the problems. For decades, race, gender, {{and a host of other}} demographic factors have played a substantial role in jury selection. Litigants have used these factors to predict which jurors might be favorably disposed to their case. The concern is not simply the gamesmanship of advocacy, but contemplates important policy questions as well. Permitting litigants to have a substantial role in selecting the decision maker or shaping the decision making <b>body</b> <b>bolsters</b> respect for, and legitimacy of, the outcome of a trial. This is particularly true in criminal cases where the jury is charged with the awesome responsibility over a person 2 ̆ 7 s liberty, or even life or death. I propose that the jury selection process be changed to permit the criminal defendant, at his option, to actually select from a pool of qualified jurors, people he believes are favorable to his case. I would permit the prosecutor to respond to that choice by making a choice of his own, limited by the number that the defendant has directly selected. In this way I believe we can remove much of the cat and mouse game of lawyers offering contrived reasons for challenging jurors. This process will also clarify the host of questions raised by the use of jury selection professionals which, I believe, under the current law may well be illegal, since the advice they provide often relies on demographic data that includes assumptions and stereotypes about race and gender. I will also propose several reforms that focus on the education of the jury and the information lawyers receive about the jurors through the voir dire process. I will also present reforms designed to stimulate greater community education and inclusiveness in jury pools by requiring teenagers seeking their driver 2 ̆ 7 s license to complete mandatory juror citizenship training in order to instill the importance of the jury system in our country to the next generation of decision makers. My hope is to place the concern over discrimination in jury selection in its proper context with the need for legitimate advocacy. Justice will be better served by replacing the current system which invites and tolerates dishonesty. Through these reforms, it is my hope to strengthen the greatest jury system in the history of civilization...|$|R
