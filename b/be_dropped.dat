5|$|A {{scoring system}} to {{evaluate}} material {{is to add}} up the piece values of the material on the board. In chess, when a pawn equals one unit, a bishop or knight is worth three, a rook five and a queen nine. These values are {{a consequence of the}} difference in mobility of the pieces. In bughouse, piece values differ because pieces in reserve essentially have the same mobility as they can <b>be</b> <b>dropped</b> on any vacant square. The pawn relatively gains importance in bughouse chess, as its very limited mobility does not handicap reserve pawns. They can for instance <b>be</b> <b>dropped</b> to block non-contact checks. Pawns can <b>be</b> <b>dropped</b> onto the seventh rank, one step away from promotion, which again adds to their importance. Long-range pieces like the queen or the rook lose relative value, due to the constantly changing pawn structure. They {{are also more likely to}} be hemmed in. A valuation system, first suggested by FICS-player Gnejs, often applied to bughouse is pawn=1, bishop=knight=rook=2 and queen=4.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, {{when one}} board finishes, play can {{continue}} on the other board. In this case, pieces in reserve can still <b>be</b> <b>dropped,</b> but no new pieces are coming in. The outcome of the match is then decided by adding the score of the two boards.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the trial}} began, {{supporters}} of the defendants decided on a campaign of letter-writing and demonstrations: the CPUSA urged its members to bombard Truman with letters requesting that the charges <b>be</b> <b>dropped.</b> Later, supporters similarly flooded Judge Medina with telegrams and letters urging him to dismiss the charges.|$|E

5|$|Entering the Democratic nominating convention, Brown {{seemed to}} be the {{favorite}} for the nomination. On the first ballot, he garnered the most votes (275), leading Clay (264), Clardy (190), and Hardin (186). Over the next nine ballots, the vote counts changed little. Finally, the convention chairman announced that the candidate receiving the fewest votes on the next ballot would <b>be</b> <b>dropped</b> from the voting. Clardy received the fewest votes, and on the next ballot, his supporters divided almost equally between the remaining three candidates. Hardin was the next candidate to <b>be</b> <b>dropped,</b> and Brown received a majority over Clay on the thirteenth ballot.|$|E

5|$|Operation Varsity was {{therefore}} planned with these three airborne divisions in mind, {{with all three}} to <b>be</b> <b>dropped</b> behind German lines {{in support of the}} 21st Army Group as it conducted its amphibious assaults to breach the Rhine. However, during the earliest planning stages, it became apparent that the 13th Airborne Division would be unable to participate in the operation, as there were only enough combat transport aircraft in the area to transport two divisions effectively. The plan for the operation {{was therefore}} altered to accommodate the two remaining airborne divisions, the British 6th and U.S. 17th Airborne Divisions. The two airborne divisions would <b>be</b> <b>dropped</b> behind German lines, with their objective to land around Wesel and disrupt enemy defences in order to aid the advance of the British Second Army towards Wesel.|$|E
5|$|The Republican offer {{called for}} an {{approximately}} $35 billion budget and no tax increases, and relied on delaying the payment of some K-12 school aid and issuing bonds against future tobacco revenue to cover the remaining gap. It differed from the previous Republican proposals in several provisions, particularly increasing the K-12 per-student formula by $50 per year to cover additional borrowing costs, adding $10 million to the University of Minnesota budget to equalize Minnesota State Colleges and Universities cuts, and restoring funding to the Department of Human Rights and the Trade Office. Dayton's conditions were that measures on social issues such as abortion <b>be</b> <b>dropped</b> from the budget, 15percent reductions to state employees in all agencies <b>be</b> <b>dropped,</b> and a $500 million infrastructure construction bonding bill.|$|E
5|$|A player {{capturing}} a piece immediately passes {{that piece}} to the capturing player's partner. The partner keeps these pieces in reserve and may, instead of playing a regular move, place {{one of these}} pieces on the board (as in shogi and crazyhouse), called dropping the piece. Pieces in reserve or on deck may <b>be</b> <b>dropped</b> on any vacant square, including squares where the piece delivers check or checkmate; however, pawns may not <b>be</b> <b>dropped</b> on the first or last rank. Dropped pawns may promote, but all promoted pawns convert back to pawns when captured. In play over the board, a promoted pawn can be put on its side to indicate promotion. A pawn placed on the second rank may move two squares on its first move. Each player must keep the reserve or stock pieces {{on the table in}} front of the board, always visible to all players of the game.|$|E

5|$|Béatrice Altariba as Paulette Mérodon, a {{young woman}} who is taken into police custody after being caught shoplifting. Due to a {{resemblance}} with the women Génessier has kidnapped, she is informed by Parot that the charges against her will <b>be</b> <b>dropped</b> if she checks into Génessier's clinic. She is subsequently released and kidnapped to have her face transplanted, but is saved by Christiane before Génessier is able to perform surgery on her.|$|E
5|$|Captain Salmond rushed on {{deck and}} ordered the anchor to <b>be</b> <b>dropped,</b> the quarter-boats to be lowered, and a turn astern to be given by the engines. However, as the ship backed off the rock, the sea rushed into the large hole made by the {{collision}} and the ship struck again, buckling the plates of the forward bilge and ripping open the bulkheads. Shortly, the forward compartments and the engine rooms were flooded, and over 100 soldiers were drowned in their berths.|$|E

5|$|The 17th Airborne was to land its {{units in}} the {{southern}} portion of the area chosen for the operation, engaging the German forces that were defending the area, securing the Diersfordterwald Forest which dominated the surrounding area and capturing three bridges that spanned the River Issel. It would then hold the territory it had captured until it linked up units from the British 6th Airborne Division, which would land in the northern section of the operational area, and finally advance alongside 21st Army Group once the Allied ground forces had made contact with the airborne forces. To avoid heavy casualties such as those incurred by the British 1st Airborne Division during Operation Market Garden, both Allied airborne divisions would <b>be</b> <b>dropped</b> only after Allied ground units had secured crossings over the Rhine; the two divisions would also <b>be</b> <b>dropped</b> only a relatively short distance behind German lines, to ensure that reinforcements {{would be able to}} link up with them after only a few hours and they would not be isolated.|$|E

50|$|On 15 August 1943, a flare <b>was</b> <b>dropped</b> over Vila, Solomon Islands on Kolombangara. A second flare <b>was</b> <b>dropped</b> over Rice Anchorage. Two {{additional}} letters <b>were</b> <b>dropped</b> {{about two}} points off the starboard bow of APc-25, at about 1,500 yards distance. At approximately {{the time of}} the last two flares, a bomb, not over 500 pounds, <b>was</b> <b>dropped</b> off the port bow at a distance of approximately 300 yards. The concussion was felt. No shrapnel hit APc-25 or the crew.

Although this too <b>was</b> <b>dropped,</b> a bylaw specifically prohibiting top-free swimming was passed. Eventually her efforts led to a new bylaw allowing top-free swimming.|$|R
5|$|The Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act (or CLASS Act) {{was enacted}} as Title VIII of the ACA.

5|$|The Defense Communications Planning Group's {{research}} and development program created an advanced technological system. Muscle Shoals would consist of three interdependent parts. First, there were air-dropped, battery-powered acoustic and seismic sensors. The camouflaged sensors were to <b>be</b> <b>dropped</b> in strings at predetermined geographical points along the PAVN logistical network. Once emplaced, they would serve as tripwires to any movement or activity along the system.|$|E

It was unrelated to either the American Chrysler K or PSA Douvrin 2.2-litre engines. Available trim levels were designated GL and GLS. The GL was the only model to feature the four-speed manual transmission, and have power steering as an option as opposed to standard. It was first to <b>be</b> <b>dropped,</b> for the 1983 model year.|$|E
