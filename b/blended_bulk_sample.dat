40|$|In {{this work}} we have {{investigated}} changes in dielectric properties, electrical conductivity and complex impedance of Fe 2 TiO 5 nanopowder compacts and <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> {{as a function}} of elevated temperature (room to 423 K compacts, to 443 K <b>bulk</b> <b>samples),</b> frequency (100 Hz– 1 MHz) and composition (starting molar ratio of Fe 2 O 3 and TiO 2 1 : 1 —PSB 11 and 1 : 1. 5 —PSB 115). XRD, SEM and TEM analysis of PSB 11 and PSB 115 powders obtained by a simple solid state process from starting hematite and anatase nanopowders confirmed the formation of nanostructured orthorhombic pseudobrookite with small amounts of excess hematite and rutile. The dielectric constant decreased with frequency and temperature for both compacts and <b>bulk</b> <b>samples.</b> Higher values were determined for <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> also reflecting the influence of sample composition. Change in the dielectric loss also reflected the influence of sample composition showing one maximum at high frequencies for compacts, and two maxima at room temperature for <b>bulk</b> <b>samples.</b> Complex impedance was analyzed using equivalent circuits and showed in the case of compacts the influence of both grain and grain boundary components, while in the case of <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> the dominant influence of grain boundaries. The temperature dependence of the determined grain and grain boundary resistance for compacts and grain boundary resistance for <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> was analyzed using the adiabatic small polaron hopping model enabling determination of activation energies for conduction, while the temperature dependence of relaxation times enabled determination of activation energies for relaxation. Changes in electrical conductivity for compacts and <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> followed Jonscher’s power law. The change of the determined frequency constant with temperature showed that at elevated temperatures the quantum mechanical-tunneling model for the case of small polaron hopping explains the conduction mechanism occurring in both compacts and <b>bulk</b> <b>samples...</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Bulk</b> <b>samples</b> of {{lanthanum}} polyphosphate were synthesized {{through a}} hydrothermal hot-pressing (HHP) process. In this process, pressing temperature, pressure and volume of water were varied {{in order to}} improve the density and strength of the resulting materials. The strength of the <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> was estimated through drilling and ultrasonic treatments. In order to improve the strength of the materials, the use of microwave irradiation was examined. Lanthanum polyphosphate formed porous <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> with a filling factor of approximately 70 %, which was calculated from real and theoretical densities. With respect to machinable strength, a drilled hole greater than 7.0 mm in diameter was obtained on some <b>bulk</b> <b>samples,</b> and the diameter of the samples was 14 mm. The HHP process is a useful method for obtaining <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> of lanthanum polyphosphate. Bulk lanthanum polyphosphate containing water crumbled easily to a powder form upon ultrasonication. However, these <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> retained their shape upon ultrasonication, despite containing water, after exposure to microwave irradiation, and also experienced minimal weight loss. Furthermore, to study the effect of microwave heating, bulk lanthanum orthophosphate, yttrium orthophosphate and polyphosphate were also examined.|$|R

We report our measurements of impurity concentrations, values of Tc and magnetization vs. H near Hc 1. X-ray measurements, taken before and after vacuum furnace annealing, indicated a greater reduction in the lattice constant (due to annealing) of the CVD sample than for the <b>bulk</b> <b>sample.</b> Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS), in combination with x-ray diffraction revealed the CVD sample had approximately 3 at. % hydrogen; seven times more hydrogen than the <b>bulk</b> <b>sample.</b> After annealing, the impurity concentrations in the <b>bulk</b> <b>sample</b> were measured by commercial interstitial gas analysis (IGA). A precise comparison of nearby x-ray Bragg reflections with known single crystals of silicon and sapphire revealed several unsuspected features of these samples, including a possible dependence of the lattice constant on depth within a few microns of the surface and significant surface damage. Magnetic moment measurements in the superconducting state indicate sharp NC-SC transitions with Tc= 9. 26 K for the <b>bulk</b> <b>sample</b> and Tc= 8. 88 K for the CVD sample. The difference of 0. 38 +/- 0. 03 K persisted after annealing the CVD sample. At 1. 9 K, Hc 1 (CVD) was equal to Hc 1 (bulk) or even perhaps slightly higher, while Hc 2 was 5100 - 6200 Oe for CVD and 3950 Oe for the <b>bulk</b> <b>sample</b> (as expected for pure Nb). The impurity content in the CVD, as inferred from comparative SIMS and IGA analysis of the <b>bulk</b> <b>sample</b> would not account for these differences, which are conjectured {{to be due to}} permanent defects caused by cooling the high hydrogen content of the CVD sample initially...|$|R

The results show that air-drying of the <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> increased remineralization of dentine considerably; the microradiographic parameters (1 (d), Delta Z and 1 (a)) show that the degree of remineralization ranks: thin wet sections > bulk dried > bulk wet. Especially, the remineralization inside lesions was greatly enhanced in thin sections and dried samples. It is presumed that the increased remineralization in dried samples is caused by a 'sponge effect', in which the remineralization fluid is sucked up in a dried shrunken lesion, resulting in fast and deep penetration of remineralization solution and/or presumably increased nucleation...|$|R

The chemical vapour deposition of carbon on boron powder was achieved by reacting ethylene gas on high purity nano-sized boron particles (20 - 100 nm diameter) with varying deposition temperatures and partial pressures. Undoped and carbon doped boron was then reacted with magnesium rod to produce both Mg(b 1 -xCx) 2 powder and <b>bulk</b> <b>samples.</b> Transmission electron microscopy showed that the chemical vapour deposition achieved a uniformly thick carbon-rich layer on each particle, regardless of particle size. In addition, the analusis of the diffraction peaks and the characterization of the magnetisation has evidenced the coexistence of phases with different levels of carbon resulting in multiple current paths within the Mg(B 1 -xCx) 2 samples. The study of the preparation process for bulk Mg(B 1 -xCx) 2 samples has evidenced that reducing the difference between the time constant of reaction and the time constant of diffusion is crucial to opbtain well-sintered samples devoid of cracks. Doping with carbon has shown significant improvements in the field dependence of K for the MG(B 1 -xCx) 2 <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> reaching values com[parable with the best literature-reported data for <b>bulk</b> <b>samples.</b> However, the K values of the MG(B 1 -xCx) 2 <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> were observed to be noticeably lower when compared with the beszt liter 4 arture-reported data for wires and tapes, owing to the greater density achievable in the latter.
