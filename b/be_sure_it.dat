25|$|Washington D.C.'s The Faith took {{hardcore}} punk to {{new places}} in the early 1980s. Even during their existence, their music hinted at what was to come, softening the standard-issue hardcore approach somewhat with better-developed melodies and a more inward-looking perspective. To <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>it</b> was high-energy, high-velocity punk, but its subtle deviations from the norm opened up new vistas for the D.C. scene.|$|E
25|$|According to the Burmese chronicles, {{the first}} clashes of war {{occurred}} {{towards the end}} of the monsoon season in the Tavoy frontier. On 20 September 1759 (15th waning of Tawthalin 1121 ME), Alaungpaya was informed of Siamese attacks on Burmese shipping around Tavoy and continued Siamese intrusions into the Tavoy frontier. To <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>it</b> could very well be Burmese justification but it could also be that the Siamese were already enforcing their forward perimeter even by then.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, this {{organization}} of power based upon personal relationships peculiar to the feudal system ensured that, {{after he became}} king of Scotland in 1124, {{the only thing that}} kept David from pursuing a policy of vigorous expansion was his friendship with Henry. To <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>it</b> should not be surprising to learn that David harboured territorial ambitions– such desires were cultivated by the prevailing culture of the Normans, the greatest warriors of the age, and applauded if they ended in conquest– nor should it be any surprise that he soon sought to express them upon Henry’s death. That he should seek to place those ambitions upon a solid basis of propriety would have been even less remarkable, had a suitable excuse to attack not been conveniently at hand.|$|E

500|$|Lane ran for Governor of California in 1902 on the Democratic and Non-Partisan tickets. [...] At a {{time when}} California was {{dominated}} by the Republican Party, he lost by less than a percentage point to George Pardee. (Theodore Roosevelt won the state by 35points two years later.) [...] Between 8,000 and 10,000votes were disqualified on various technicalities, possibly costing him the election. [...] During the campaign, the influential San Francisco Examiner slanted its news coverage against him. [...] Examiner owner William Randolph Hearst later denied responsibility for this policy, and stated that if Lane ever needed anything, he should send Hearst a telegram. [...] Lane retorted that if Hearst received a telegram purportedly signed by Lane, asking him to do anything, he could <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> was a forgery.|$|E
2500|$|The {{psychoanalyst}} Christopher Bollas {{insists the}} story is more about the narrator than the narrated. [...] "The narrator's willingness to tolerate [...] work stoppage is {{what needs to be}} explained [...] As the story proceeds, it becomes increasingly clear that the lawyer identifies with his clerk. To <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>it</b> is an ambivalent identification, but that only makes it all the more powerful." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 19, 2010, Rihanna made {{newspaper}} headlines {{when she was}} taken to hospital after her performance in Zürich. Rihanna's spokesperson says that she [...] "had an injured rib and went to have it looked at to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> was nothing serious, and it wasn’t". Alenka Ambroz, head of the clinic's corporate communications said: [...] "Rihanna arrived at the accident and emergency unit. We're {{not going to give}} any details." [...] Rihanna, however, was still able to perform at the next show in Lyon, France, on April 20.|$|E

2500|$|The war came at {{the near}} peak of Konbaung {{military}} power. (Their victory over the Chinese is considered the peak.) According to Lieberman, the [...] "near simultaneous victories over Siam (1767) and China (1765–1769) testified to a truly astonishing elan unmatched since Bayinnaung." [...] To <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>it</b> {{was not so much}} that the Burmese had more troops or superior weapons; they did not. The main reason for Burmese victory was the same as that in the 1760 war: the Burmese, who had been in successive wars since 1740, simply had experienced, proven, confident commanders, while most Siamese command had little battlefield experience except in the 1760 war.|$|E
2500|$|With Kuyper, Van Til {{believed}} that the Christian and the non-Christian have different ultimate standards, presuppositions that color the interpretation of every fact in every area of life. But with Warfield, he {{believed that}} a rational proof for Christianity is possible: [...] "Positively Hodge and Warfield were quite right in stressing the fact that Christianity meets every legitimate demand of reason. Surely Christianity is not irrational. To <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>it</b> must be accepted on faith, but surely it must not be taken on blind faith. Christianity is capable of rational defense." [...] And like Warfield, Van Til {{believed that the}} Holy Spirit will use arguments against unbelief {{as a means to}} convert non-believers.|$|E
2500|$|Acronyms {{are used}} most often to abbreviate names of {{organizations}} and long or frequently referenced terms. The {{armed forces and}} government agencies frequently employ acronyms; some well-known examples from the United States are among the [...] "alphabet agencies" [...] (also jokingly referred to as [...] "alphabet soup") created by Franklin D. Roosevelt (also of course known as FDR) under the New Deal. Business and industry also are prolific coiners of acronyms. The rapid advance {{of science and technology}} in recent centuries seems to be an underlying force driving the usage, as new inventions and concepts with multiword names create a demand for shorter, more manageable names. One representative example, from the U.S. Navy, is COMCRUDESPAC, which stands for commander, cruisers destroyers Pacific; it's also seen as [...] "ComCruDesPac". [...] "YABA-compatible" [...] (where YABA stands for [...] "yet another bloody acronym") is used to mean that a term's acronym can be pronounced but is not an offensive word, e.g., [...] "When choosing a new name, <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> is 'YABA-compatible'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another common {{response}} to the omnipotence paradox {{is to try to}} define omnipotence to mean something weaker than absolute omnipotence, such as definition 3 or 4 above. The paradox can be resolved by simply stipulating that omnipotence does not require that the being have abilities that are logically impossible, but only be able to do anything that conforms to the laws of logic. A good example of a modern defender of this line of reasoning is George Mavrodes. Essentially, Mavrodes argues that it is no limitation on a being's omnipotence to say that it cannot make a round square. Such a [...] "task" [...] is termed by him a [...] "pseudo-task" [...] as it is self-contradictory and inherently nonsense. Harry Frankfurt—following from Descartes—has responded to this solution with a proposal of his own: that God can create a stone impossible to lift and also lift said stoneFor why should God not be able to perform the task in question? To <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>it</b> is a task—the task of lifting a stone which He cannot lift—whose description is self-contradictory. But if God is supposed capable of performing one task whose description is self-contradictory—that of creating the problematic stone in the first place—why should He not be supposed capable of performing another—that of lifting the stone? After all, is there any greater trick in performing two logically impossible tasks than there is in performing one? ...|$|E
