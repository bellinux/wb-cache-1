The production does not include any chemical additives, only {{the heat from the}} sun and nourishment from the earth. Today 7 different grapes are cultivated. All of them are planted around the orangery and most of the vines come from Baltic.|$|E
40|$|A {{definition}} of the term “Sustainability” few specifications (technique, economic, environmental, social, existential, ethical, global, meta-ethical) able to explain several aspects for which a viticulture can be considered sustainable. Viticulture is involved by all these implications over the technologies utilized along all the stages of the production and marketing chain. Intensification of cultivation, strategy of territory valorization, land use, mechanization, genetic improvement and labor exploitation are examined. Moreover the development of <b>biodynamic</b> <b>cultivation</b> is critically discussed to offer a clue as to understand how the consequent techniques of cultivation are compatible and sustainable with the requirement of the viticulture production and wine market. It may be argued that some discrepancy between the general definition and the application of the techniques in viticulture exist, arising several implications...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} {{transformation}} {{that affects the}} world wine industry is also felt {{at the level of}} the Romanian market. The article aims to address two of the directions this market evolves in. The aim of the paper is to outline the extent to which wine cellars know and use the <b>biodynamic</b> <b>cultivation</b> and vinification techniques and to measure their willingness to practice enotourism as a wine promotion measure. After a short presentation of the general context of the Romanian wine industry and of the latest developments in this sector, the author analyzes of the results of a qualitative research carried out with seven wine producers in the Muntenia Ol tenia area. The results of the research allow sketching some proposals that are in line with the trends on the international wine market and that contribute to the increase of the sales of Romanian producers'...|$|E
40|$|Compared {{with the}} total number of farmers engaged in organic farming in Austria, the number of people {{concerned}} with biodynamic farming is rather small. – So, what are the underlying motives and values of farmers for <b>biodynamic</b> <b>cultivation?</b> What is the farmers’ anthroposophical approach to the method? And how do these farmers assess the present situation as well as future developments in the field of organic farming? On the basis of qualitative research a number of semi-structured interviews with countrymen and -women from ten different farms located in Lower Austria were conducted. The interviews were carried out by means of an interview guide and exclusively addressed people engaged in biodynamic farming. As to the motives for biodynamic farming for example, ecological aspects, internal advancement and the effective implementation of the method were in the foreground. As regards personal values, independence and self-determination, family and personal advancement as well as taking on responsibility seem to be important. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the changes {{observed}} {{in the first year}} of conversion to organic and <b>biodynamic</b> <b>cultivation</b> in a vineyard growing Rhine Riesling and Pinot blanc grafted onto SO 4 and trained using the simple pergola system in a hilly area in Trentino (Italy). Three farming methods were compared: conventional (CONV; chemical weeding under the rows, grass mowing between rows, mechanical topping and airoperated leaf removal, cluster thinning with gibberellic acid), organic (ORG; soil working under the rows, grass mowing between rows, rolling up the canopy along the furthest wire, air-operated leaf removal and hand fining) and biodynamic (BIOD; soil working under the rows, deep ripping between rows, side-shoot removal by hand, green manure in alternate rows, 2 soil treatments with horn manure 500, 3 leaf treatments with horn silicate 501). The cluster weight, real fertility, yield/vine and Ravaz index were measured. Sugars, total acidity, pH, tartaric and malic acids, K and the assimilable nitrogen of grapes harvested from 10 parcels for each variety at ripeness were measured. In both varieties, BIOD farming showed a higher cluster weight, yield/vine and Ravaz index, while the differences between ORG and CONV were significant in terms of cluster compactness in both varieties and cluster weight and botrytis attack only in the case of Riesling. As regards grape composition, technologically speaking the main differences observed were in pH - slightly lower in the ORG and BIOD plots - and above all in yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN), while no statistically significant differences were found for °Brix. ORG and BIOD grapes had half the YAN content of the CONV grape...|$|E
