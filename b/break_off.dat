5|$|Occasionally a Portia {{is killed}} or injured while {{pursuing}} prey up to twice Portia′s size. P. labiata is killed in 2.1% of pursuits and injured but not killed in 3.9%, P. schultzi is killed in 1.7% and injured but not killed in 5.3%, and P. fimbriata in Queensland is killed in 0.06% of its pursuits and injured but not killed in another 0.06%. A Portia′s especially tough skin often prevents injury, even when its body {{is caught in}} the other spider's fangs. When injured, Portia bleeds and may lose one or more legs. Spiders' palps and legs <b>break</b> <b>off</b> easily when attacked, Portia′s palps and legs <b>break</b> <b>off</b> exceptionally easily, which may be a defence mechanism, and Portias are often seen with missing legs or palps, while other salticids in the same habitat are not seen with missing legs or palps.|$|E
5|$|The spiny {{plates on}} the back and tail of the tuatara {{resemble}} those of a crocodile more than a lizard, but the tuatara shares with lizards the ability to <b>break</b> <b>off</b> its tail when caught by a predator, and then regenerate it.|$|E
5|$|Farmers use live {{electric}} wires to guard their farms, which kills other animals as well. Farmers in Neemuch (Madhya Pradesh) {{went on a}} hunger strike in 2015 demanding {{compensation for the damage}} caused by nilgai. Although blackbuck cause a similar problem, the damage caused by them is significantly lower as they merely <b>break</b> <b>off</b> young shoots. A 1990 study suggested culling, building enclosures for the antelopes and fencing off agricultural areas as remedies for the menace.|$|E

5|$|The {{fruits of}} Schlumbergera do not open spontaneously when ripe, {{and appear to}} be adapted for {{distribution}} by birds, which eat the seeds and pulp contained in the fruit. Birds have been observed removing seeds which had stuck to their beaks by rubbing them on tree branches, where the seeds {{might be able to}} germinate. Segments may also <b>break</b> <b>off</b> from the stems and take root, thus enabling plants to propagate vegetatively.|$|E

5|$|Turner met Johnny Stompanato {{during the}} spring of 1957, shortly after ending her {{marriage}} to Barker. After she discovered his ties to the Los Angeles underworld (in particular, his association with gangster Mickey Cohen), she tried to <b>break</b> <b>off</b> the affair out of fear of bad publicity. Stompanato was not easily deterred, however, and {{over the course of the}} following year, they carried on a relationship filled with violent arguments, physical abuse, and repeated reconciliations.|$|E
5|$|After {{discovering}} that Tracy {{is still in}} contact with NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), Jack realizes that their relationship {{is the key to}} bringing Tracy back to TGS. Jack, therefore, orders Kenneth to <b>break</b> <b>off</b> all contact with Tracy, although this fails because of Kenneth's relationship with Tracy. Seeing an opportunity, Jack states that since Kenneth's duties were primarily taking care of Tracy, and Tracy no longer works at NBC, Kenneth is no longer needed. Not wanting Kenneth to lose his job, Tracy agrees to return on the stipulation that Kenneth keeps his job.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} reinforcements, Reshef {{focused on}} clearing the Tirtur Road. He left {{a battalion of}} around 30 tanks between the junction and {{the western part of}} the Chinese Farm, and prepared to attack with two armored battalions provided by Sharon. He concentrated on the section of the Tirtur Road defended by an Egyptian battalion forming the left flank of the 16th Infantry Brigade. One of Reshef's battalions attacked from the north-east, the other from the west. The Egyptian battalion managed to halt the advance, aided by fire from tanks and anti-tank weapons on the slopes of Missouri, a hill north-west of the Chinese Farm, causing Reshef to <b>break</b> <b>off</b> his attack.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First World War in August 1914, she was mobilised for service in the South America Station, where she patrolled for German commerce raiders. She was involved in the search for the German East Asia Squadron of Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee. Too slow to follow Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock's cruisers, she missed the Battle of Coronel in November 1914, where Cradock was defeated. Moored at Port Stanley as a defensive battery, she fired the first shots of the Battle of the Falklands in December, which led Spee to <b>break</b> <b>off</b> the attack before being chased down and destroyed by Admiral Doveton Sturdee's battlecruisers.|$|E
5|$|Attempts by law {{enforcement}} to investigate conditions at Gold Base have been blocked by legal difficulties and the unwillingness {{of those on the}} base to talk to the police. According to Lawrence Wright, who wrote an account of the Hole in his 2013 book , the Riverside County sheriff's office has never received a complaint from someone at the base about their treatment there, despite the many accounts of mistreatment. Wright attributes this to the fear that many Scientologists have of bringing shame upon Scientology and of being forced to <b>break</b> <b>off</b> contact with their families and friends.|$|E
5|$|Benedict Arnold next wrote {{a series}} of letters to Clinton, even before he might have {{expected}} {{a response to the}} July 7 letter. In a July 11 letter, he complained that the British did not appear to trust him, and threatened to <b>break</b> <b>off</b> negotiations unless progress was made. On July 12, he wrote again, making explicit the offer to surrender West Point, although his price rose to £20,000 (in addition to indemnification for his losses), with a £1,000 down payment to be delivered with the response. These letters were delivered by Samuel Wallis, another Philadelphia businessman who spied for the British, rather than by Stansbury.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} that Whetstone had reached Hispaniola, Du Casse had already departed. Benbow's force {{subsequently}} sighted the French on 19 August, sailing off Cape Santa Marta. The French had three transports and four warships carrying between 68 and 70 guns, while Benbow commanded seven ships carrying between 50 and 70 guns. The English forces were heavily scattered, and the light winds meant that they were slow to regroup. They did not achieve a form of collective order until four in the afternoon, after which a partial engagement was fought, lasting about two hours, until nightfall caused the fleets to temporarily <b>break</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E

During a training exercise with a cadet, a trainee pilot caused a flap to <b>break</b> <b>off</b> the plane, sending it spinning out of control. Grissom climbed from the rear seat of the small craft {{to take over the}} controls and safely land the jet.|$|E
5|$|However, Glasgow was now {{exposed to}} fire from three ships, so Howe decided to <b>break</b> <b>off</b> the battle, {{in order to avoid}} being boarded, and made sail for Newport. Despite {{extensive}} damage to the sail and rigging, he pulled away from the pursuing fleet, which was fully laden with its captured goods. Hopkins called off the chase after several hours in order to avoid an encounter with the British squadron at Newport. His only prize was Glasgow tender, which the fleet brought to anchor in New London, Connecticut on April 8.|$|E
