5|$|A 2006 International Energy Agency forum {{presented}} {{costs for}} managing intermittency {{as a function}} of wind-energy's share of total capacity for several countries, as shown in the table on the right. Three reports on the wind variability in the UK issued in 2009, generally agree that variability of wind needs to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> account by adding 20% to the operating reserve, but it does not make the grid unmanageable. The additional costs, which are modest, can be quantified.|$|E
5|$|According to the plan, {{the type}} of {{consumption}} (i.e. whether agricultural, industrial and civil) will also be considered when setting energy prices. The subsidy plan will be implemented in proportion with geographical regions because warm regions consume more electricity during summer while cold regions consume more gas during winter. Finally, the time of consumption (i.e. during peak and off-peak hours) and the consumption demand (i.e. whether it is low or high) will <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> consideration.|$|E
5|$|An {{alignment}} {{is calculated}} {{by measuring the}} azimuth, the angle from north, of the structure and the altitude of the horizon it faces The azimuth is usually measured using a theodolite or a compass. A compass is easier to use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its magnetic declination must <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> account. Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree.|$|E

50|$|Five lead {{changes were}} made (consisting of Ned Jarrett, Darel Dieringer, Billy Wade, and Ned Jarrett). After one hour and thirty-two minutes of racing, Billy Wade managed to defeat LeeRoy Yarbrough by six seconds in front of 10,000 live spectators (approximately 24% of the racetrack's modern capacity). The total prize purse handed out for this racing event was $6,395 ($ when {{inflation}} <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> effect); Billy Wade received $1,400 of it ($ when inflation <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> effect) while Lee Petty received a meager $150 ($ when inflation <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> effect).|$|R

5|$|However, poison {{still exists}} as a murderous entity today, {{but it is}} not as popular form of {{conducting}} murder {{as it used to be}} in past times, probably because of the wider range of ways to kill people and other factors that must <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> consideration. One of the more recent deaths by poisoning was that of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 from lethal polonium-210 radiation poisoning.|$|E
5|$|It must <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> {{account that}} Soviet T-26 was one {{the most modern}} tanks of the world when it arrived to Spain, and Soviet Army tank {{doctrine}} was really advanced. Unfortunately for the Spanish Government during these years Stalin decided to eliminate all those generals that supported modern tank warfare and sent to Spain the officers that he liked. This meant Soviet tanks potential was never exploited in Spain as it could.|$|E

5|$|Repetitive diving {{occurs when}} two dives are {{separated}} by a short surface interval, during which the diver has not completely outgassed from the first dive. The gas loading from the first dive must then <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> account when determining no stop times and decompression requirements for the second dive. Multiple decompressions per day over multiple days can {{increase the risk of}} decompression sickness because of the buildup of asymptomatic bubbles, which reduce the rate of off-gassing and are not accounted for in most decompression algorithms.|$|E

5|$|SR209 was {{designated}} in the 1964 state highway renumbering. Plans for an interchange between I-5, I-8, SR 209, and SR 109 date from 1965, although several concerns had to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> account, including {{the preservation of}} historical Old Town and keeping traffic through the area moving during construction. The goal was to begin construction in 1966, and complete the interchange in 1969. There were concerns about a $3 billion shortfall in funding during May 1966, which caused the San Diego Chamber of Commerce Highway Committee to recommend the completion of SR 109 as a project.|$|E
5|$|Some large {{satellites}} are {{of similar}} size or {{larger than the}} planet Mercury, e.g. Jupiter's Galilean moons and Titan.

Likewise, dwarf planets in the asteroid belt and Kuiper belt should be considered planets according to Stern.|$|E
5|$|The Constitutional Tribunal, which {{consisted}} of the Chief Justice Yong Pung How and Judges of Appeal M. Karthigesu and L.P.

50|$|Notodden Old Station was {{the first}} station to serve Notodden, and <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> use when Tinnoset Line opened in 1909.

5|$|The Sm3 {{had a long}} {{prototype}} phase {{before the}} main series was ordered, with reliability issues being brought up by the press from time to time. Negative reporting continues to haunt the series' reputation. Reliability problems cannot be proven, as no statistics of specific train types are available. The train has not managed to cope with harsh Finnish weather conditions, and the time benefit of the tilting mechanism will not <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> account in timetables of winter 2011–2012. Nevertheless, the Sm3 has also received positive feedback from passengers and has led to increased operating speeds on the Finnish rail network.|$|E
5|$|In April, Pietraru {{met with}} the Provisional Government's Alexander Guchkov, and an {{agreement}} was reached regarding the maximum total of troops to be enlisted in the Romanian Corps. Answering to special pleas from Romanian Premier Ion I. C. Brătianu, Guchkov allowed for the recruitment of 30,000 prisoners in his custody. The order was revised by Alexander Kerensky, who reduced that number to 5,000 prisoners, noting that they were sorely needed as working hands in Russia's agriculture and industry. In practice, Quartermaster Ivan Pavlovich Romanovsky only allowed recruitment {{to take place in}} Moscow Military District, ordering that no more than 1,500 prisoners should <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> account.|$|E
