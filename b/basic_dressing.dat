5000|$|The most famous, and {{for many}} also the original, tam (...) , lit. [...] "pounded") style salad is som tam, made from unripe papaya. The <b>basic</b> <b>dressing</b> for a som tam-style salad {{contains}} garlic, palm sugar, lime juice, bird's-eye chillies, dried shrimp and fish sauce. This dressing is slightly pounded and mixed together inside an earthenware mortar using a wooden pestle. With certain kinds of tam, {{some or all of}} the additional ingredients will also be pounded slightly if this helps to release the flavours. Though with dishes such as tam phonla mai (fruit) or tam mu yo (a sausage similar to liverwurst), the main ingredients are simply mixed in with the dressing. Many types of tam salads will also contain (sliced) tomatoes.|$|E
5000|$|Phla (...) style salads can be {{made with}} a variety of proteins. Popularly used are pork (phla mu), prawns (phla kung) or beef (phla nuea). The <b>basic</b> <b>dressing</b> is very much the same as a yam but with a difference. In {{addition}} to the fish sauce, lime juice, chillies, and shallots or onions, a phla style salad will also always contain large amounts of thinly sliced lemongrass and mint. Additional fresh herbs, such as coriander leaves, can also be added to the mix. Some versions are made with grilled pork or beef, other versions will also have nam phrik phao, a sweet roasted chilli paste, mixed in with the dressing. This last version is popular with squid (phla pla muek) and with prawns.|$|E
40|$|In two {{greenhouse}} experiments, {{the response}} of maize plants (Zea mays L.) to macro and micronutrient fertilizers was studied. The first experiment was conducted in Cairo, Egypt in which maize plants were grown on saline soils with ECₑ values of 1. 42, 6. 12 and 12. 1 dSm⁻¹ and fertilized with N, P, K alone and in combination. It was found that maize plants produced the highest dry matter when NP fertilizers were added in the Ca-form {{compared to the other}} fertilizer treatments, and this positive response decreased with increasing salinity level. Also, it was found that application of P and K fertilizers either alone or together as PK augmented the adverse effect of salinity on dry matter and nutrients uptake. In addition, the concentration and uptake of Na⁺ ions in the shoot tissues decreased with increasing salinity level up to ECₑ 12 dSm⁻¹. This could be due to Na+ exclusion or accumulation in root tissues. However, application of N and P fertilizers tended to decrease plant content of micronutrients, particularly Fe as well as Zn at high salt levels. The second experiment was conducted in a University of Arizona campus greenhouse. A Pima soil from the Marana area was artificially salinized with NaCl, Na₂SO₄, CaCl₂, and Mg₂SO₄ salts almost to the salinity levels mentioned above. Maize plants were grown and fertilized with NP fertilizer as a <b>basic</b> <b>dressing.</b> Chelated forms of Zn, Fe, and Mn were added with two different methods; soil and foliar spray application. Two pH values of spray nutrient solutions were used; pH 6 and pH 8. Data obtained showed increased dry matter and nutrient uptake in response to spraying maize plants with Zn + Fe or Zn+ Fe + Mn at pH value of 8 at the medium salt level relative to the other treatments. However, maize plants also showed high dry matter and nutrient uptake in response to Zn + Fe + Mn soil application at the high salt level, although Zn-pH 8 gave unexpectedly high dry matter production. It seems probable that this high dry matter obtained could be due to the effect of high pH spray treatment on increasing the activity of some enzymes, e. g. PEP-carboxylase and/or ribulose 1, 5 diphosphate carboxylase, as well as the increase in rate of translocating the photosynthates and this effect was augmented by the nutrient(s) applied. Also, it was found that Na uptake decreased while total chlorophyll and chlorophyll a content increased with increasing salinity level. The increase in the chlorophyll content could be due to either Na exclusion by the plants and/or the decrease plant growth due high salts...|$|E

Vill. , Triticum aestivum L, weed suppression. Understanding how {{to obtain}} good yields and farm profits in arable organic farming systems {{is useful for}} conventional and integrated farming to decrease the current reliance on pesticides and mineral fertilisers. Two issues are of particular importance for organic farming: organic nitrogen (N) management and weed management. Optimisation of organic N management is complex because N directly affects crop growth and yield, and indirectly affects pests, diseases and weeds. Yields in organic farming {{are known to be}} 0 - 50 % lower than in conventional farming, but it is unclear to what extent this is due to direct effects of N on growth. N management may also influence growth and reproduction of late-emerging weeds. Although they do not directly damage the crop, they may cause long-term weed management problems due to replenishment of the seed bank. The direct effects of N management on crop growth and yield of the target crops potato and wheat, and on establishment and reproduction of late-emerging weeds were investigated in a series of field experiments. Yield under organic N management strategies was explored with a model for crop growth and N dynamics in crop and soil. Nitrogen applied by slurry in amounts currently used in organic farming was found to limit growth of potato and wheat from emergence onwards. Early N limitations caused a linear decrease in the rate of early foliar expansion, while the light use efficiencies of the crops were hardly affected. Early foliar expansion rates with sufficient N were studied in more detail because they are an important base to calculate N-limited expansion rates. A combination of experiments and simulations showed that early foliar expansion rates with sufficient N could best be predicted when driven by temperature from emergence onwards up to a leaf area index of 1 for potato and 1. 5 for wheat, after which they were driven by radiation. Model explorations showed that potato tuber yields under organic N management varied considerably with timing of slurry application, weather conditions and crop maturity class, and that low yields were associated with early N shortages. Increased N supply decreased reproduction of late-emerging Stellaria media in potato, but increased that in wheat. It is concluded that a <b>basic</b> <b>dressing</b> of an organic N source with a large proportion of mineral N could improve crop yields in organic farming, while row application of such manure may favour the crop relative to the weed...|$|E

40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{standpoint}} that a national dress is a completed historical fact, the authoress states {{that a number of}} factors have contributed to the material shaping of a national garb though a process of acculturation, resulting with the final appearance of the dress. In that shaping there were impulses coming to the peasants from the higher sylistic accomplishments. Looking for an axample, the authoress analyzes a variant from of the Pannonic white dress found in the national costume from Prokuplje, a region lying on the Kupa river not far from Karlovac. That peasant garb shows an evident influence of the Gothic stylization in a typical Slavic linen <b>dress.</b> While the <b>basic</b> <b>dress</b> has remained {{within the framework of the}} agraria autarchy and basic material of the common Slavic character, this dress has ultimately and in various details undergone a transformation during the late Middle Ages, so that it now reveals features of the late Gothic stylization. The characteristic stylistic element has particularly been retained by the technique of ornamental embroidery that emerged in Europe in the transition time when the Gothic ornaments grew into the artistic work of the early Renaissance. In order to confirm her observation, the authoress describes two examples of such ornament which has remained in the Pokuplje variant as the main adornment up to this day. One of those two examples involves the chest and wrist ornaments on the men’s shirts from villages lying on the left bank of the Kupa river, from Šišljavić to Jamnica. The embroidered ornament in that example has consistently been executed in the so called Holbein technique. The characteristic feature in that precisely executed ornament in the shading obtained by applying dark silk to the contour lines of small motifs, the latter being embroided by the finest stitches. The completely white ornament of the other example, really exceptional, has been executed in a to-day unknown technique locally called »naniričano«; this term, according to the authoress, might be related to the Italian »ricamo«, i. e. embroidery. All considered, it results that the stylistic influences on the white linen embroidery in these Croatian villages have their origin in the known cultural centre of Ozalj, the feudal castile not far from Karlovac. In the opinion of the authoress, the distinctive factor in that centre was the presence of the personality of the countess Beatrice Frankopan in the 15 th- 16 th century transition period. Once accepted, the embroidery was retained in the peasant material trimmings up to to-day’s abrupt change, when it quickly disappears in the whirl of recent transformation...|$|R

40|$|Hospital Acquired Infections (HAIs) are {{a leading}} cause of death worldwide. In the United States, the death toll from HAIs exceeds that of AIDS, breast cancer, and motor vehicle {{accidents}} combined, totalling nearly 100, 000 deaths annually. The correct application of aseptic technique by healthcare professionals is critical to the reduction of HAIs. However, the intricacies of maintaining a sterile field can be difficult for students to grasp due to the invisible nature of pathogens. Traditional teaching methods provide limited opportunity for students to receive feedback on their technique from qualified staff. Clinical settings also afford minimal feedback due to the delay between breaches of asepsis and occurrence of infection. This research presents a novel approach to aseptic technique training that utilises Augmented Reality (AR) technology to simulate a sterile environment. A prototype system, ARSterileSim, was developed based on the findings of a pre-liminary exploratory study. ARSterileSim tracks the movements of a user as they attempt a <b>basic</b> wound <b>dressing</b> procedure, providing feedback via colour-­‐coding on a virtual mirror and auditory cues. The system makes the invisible visible, alerting the user when contamination occurs thereby completing the feedback loop. Face and content validity of the ARSterileSim prototype was assessed via a mixed methods triangulation study involving interviews with ten experts in aseptic technique training, from both academic and clinical backgrounds. Results indicate that while the prototype’s markers and tracking accuracy require improvement, the approach in general has face validity. The findings also provide evidence of content validity within the defined scope of the proto-­type, which excluded hand tracking. Participants placed particular value on the visual and auditory real-­time feedback, as well as the fact that learning takes place in a tangible context, enabling strong transfer of learning to clinical practice.
