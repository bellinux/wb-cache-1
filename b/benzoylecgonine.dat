2500|$|In November 2007, Hingis {{called a}} press conference to {{announce}} that she was under investigation for testing positive for <b>benzoylecgonine,</b> a metabolite of cocaine, during a urine test taken by players at Wimbledon. Hingis' urine sample contained an estimated 42 nanograms per millilitre of <b>benzoylecgonine.</b> The International Tennis Federation's report on the matter states that [...] "the very low estimated concentration of <b>benzoylecgonine</b> (42 ng/ml) was such that it would go unreported in many drug testing programmes such as that of the US military, which uses a screening threshold of 150 ng/ml." [...] As the amount was so low, Hingis appealed, arguing the likely cause was contamination rather than intentional ingestion. In January 2008, the International Tennis Federation's tribunal suspended Hingis from the sport for two years, effective from October 2007.|$|E
50|$|Cocaethylene (ethylbenzoylecgonine) is the {{ethyl ester}} of <b>benzoylecgonine.</b> It is {{structurally}} similar to cocaine, {{which is the}} methyl ester of <b>benzoylecgonine.</b> Cocaethylene is formed by the liver when cocaine and ethanol coexist in the blood.|$|E

50|$|<b>Benzoylecgonine</b> is {{sometimes}} found {{in drinking water}} supplies. In 2005, scientists found surprisingly large quantities of <b>benzoylecgonine</b> in Italy's Po River and used its concentration to estimate the number of cocaine users in the region. In 2006, a similar study was performed in the Swiss ski town of Saint-Moritz using waste water to estimate the daily cocaine consumption of the population. A study done in the United Kingdom found traces of <b>benzoylecgonine</b> in the country's drinking water supply, along with carbamazepine (an anticonvulsant) and ibuprofen (a common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug), although the study noted {{that the amount of}} each compound present was several orders of magnitude lower than the therapeutic dose and therefore did not pose a risk to the population.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, Moro was {{suspended}} from racing {{for two years}} after testing positive for <b>Benzoylecgonine</b> at the 2006 FIA GT Championship.|$|E

50|$|While {{playing for}} Volta Redonda in the Campeonato Carioca in 2010, Paulinho tested {{positive}} for <b>Benzoylecgonine,</b> a metabolised version of cocaine. He was subsequently banned for two years.|$|E
50|$|On January 6, it was {{announced}} that Jones failed a drug test prior to the event. He tested positive for <b>benzoylecgonine,</b> the primary metabolite of cocaine. As <b>benzoylecgonine</b> is not banned out of competition by the World Anti-Doping Agency, the NSAC could not halt Jones from fighting at UFC 182. He was randomly tested on December 4 and the results came back on December 23, the NSAC Executive Director Bob Bennett said. Jones immediately entered rehab, though it was later revealed by his mother that he only spent one night in rehab.|$|E

50|$|Lacey's {{contract}} with Accrington was terminated on 5 May 2017 after he admitted {{a breach of}} anti-doping regulations. Lacey {{had been given a}} 14 month ban by the Football Association having tested positive for <b>Benzoylecgonine</b> following a game against Hartlepool United.|$|E
50|$|On Feb. 1, 2016, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency {{announced}} that Leeper {{tested positive for}} <b>benzoylecgonine</b> from a sample collected on June 21, 2015 at the U.S. Paralympic Track & Field National Championships held in St. Paul, Minn. <b>Benzoylecgonine</b> is a metabolite of cocaine, a substance {{in the class of}} Stimulants prohibited under the USADA Protocol for Olympic and Paralympic Movement Testing and the International Paralympic Committee Anti-Doping Code, both of which have adopted the World Anti-Doping Code (“Code”) and the World Anti-Doping Agency Prohibited List. It was determined that Leeper’s use of cocaine was not intended to enhance performance, and in consideration of other mitigating factors, he was deemed eligible for a reduced, one-year sanction.|$|E
5000|$|Hingis' {{urine sample}} {{contained}} an estimated 42 nanograms per millilitre of <b>benzoylecgonine,</b> {{less than half}} the level required for a positive confirmatory test for cocaine in the workplace under the United States government Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration guidelines. The International Tennis Federation's report on the matter mentions that [...] "the very low estimated concentration of <b>benzoylecgonine</b> (42 ng/ml) was such that it would go unreported in many drug testing programmes such as that of the US military, which uses a screening threshold of 150 ng/ml." [...] As the amount was so minute, Hingis appealed, arguing the likely cause was contamination rather than intentional ingestion. In January 2008, the International Tennis Federation's tribunal suspended Hingis from the sport for two years, effective from October 2007.|$|E
50|$|David Allen (born 15 September 1985) is an English-born Irish {{international}} rugby league footballer {{who plays}} for Whitehaven. His position {{of choice is}} at second row. Allen served a two-year ban from rugby league after testing positive for <b>Benzoylecgonine,</b> a metabolite of cocaine in November 2006. He previously played for Wigan, Oldham, Barrow and Widnes.|$|E
50|$|In January 2015, it was {{revealed}} that Concas had tested positive for Cocaine metabolite <b>Benzoylecgonine</b> following a routine anti-doping test that took place after the 1-0 victory over rivals Modena on 13 December 2014. On 20 January 2015, Carpi announced the termination of Concas' contract, Concas' final game for the Biancorossi was the 1-1 draw with Virtus Lanciano on 19 December 2014.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, {{water from}} the Po was found to contain [...] "staggering" [...] amounts of <b>benzoylecgonine,</b> which is {{excreted}} by cocaine users in urine. Based on these figures, cocaine consumption {{was estimated to be}} about 4 kg daily, or 27 doses per day per thousand young adults in areas that feed into the river—a number nearly three times higher than previous estimates.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzoylecgonine</b> is the {{compound}} tested for in most substantive cocaine urinalyses. It is the corresponding carboxylic acid of cocaine, its methyl ester. It is {{formed in the}} liver by the metabolism of cocaine, catalysed by carboxylesterases, and subsequently excreted in the urine. It {{can be found in}} the urine for considerably longer than the cocaine itself which is generally cleared out within 5 days.|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{liver and}} kidney function, cocaine {{metabolites}} are detectable in urine. <b>Benzoylecgonine</b> can be detected in urine within four hours after cocaine intake and remains detectable in concentrations greater than 150 ng/mL typically for up to eight days after cocaine is used. Detection of accumulation of cocaine metabolites in hair is possible in regular users until the sections of hair grown during use are cut or fall out.|$|E
50|$|It was {{reported}} in June 2009 that Gareth tested positive for cocaine following tests on an 'A' sample of urine taken during a match between Wigan and Salford. A second 'B' sample also returned a positive result for <b>benzoylecgonine,</b> the main metabolite of cocaine. In August 2009, {{it was confirmed that}} Hock would face a two-year ban from rugby league as he did not appeal against the mandatory ban.|$|E
5000|$|On January 6, 2015, it was {{announced}} that Jones failed a drug test prior to UFC 182. He tested positive for <b>benzoylecgonine,</b> the primary metabolite of cocaine. Because <b>benzoylecgonine</b> is not banned out-of-competition by the World Anti-Doping Agency, the NSAC could not halt Jones from fighting at UFC 182. He was randomly tested on December 3, 2014, and results came back on December 23, 2014. A week after his first test, Jones was tested again. He passed the second test, which meant that the cocaine metabolite was out of his system before the fight. When the news was made public, Jones went into rehab for one night. He was fined $25,000 on January 17 for violating the UFC's Athlete Code of Conduct policy. On January 19, 2015, Jones was interviewed {{for the first time since}} the failed drug test and said: [...] "...I'm not a cocaine addict by any means or not even a frequent user. I just made a really dumb decision and got caught with my pants down in this whole situation." ...|$|E
50|$|Wigan {{confirmed}} {{in an official}} club statement on Tuesday 23 June 2009 that Gareth Hock {{tested positive for the}} primary metabolite of Cocaine; <b>Benzoylecgonine,</b> following an 'A' sample taken following a match vs Salford on Friday 5 June 2009. Wigan also confirmed that Gareth Hock faces a two-year ban, beginning June 2009, from the sport as sample 'B' came back positive. This is the first publicised incident {{of its kind in the}} club's history.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, he overcame three {{difficult}} intestine operations {{during the}} offseason, to remove scar tissue {{related to the}} appendectomy procedure he underwent in Dallas. On November 26, he {{was found to have}} <b>benzoylecgonine</b> (a by-product of cocaine) in his system after being pulled over on suspicion of drunk driving. He denied using cocaine and was not charged with any crime since he was not found to be impaired while driving. The incident placed him into the NFL's substance-abuse program.|$|E
50|$|In July 2015, Luca Paolini tested {{positive}} for cocaine (<b>Benzoylecgonine</b> metabolite) in a sample given on July 7 during the 2015 Tour de France. As a result, the team withdrew Paolini from the Tour de France. A month later, in August, Giampaolo Caruso returned an EPO positive from a sample taken in March 2012, which had been subsequently retested due to advances in detecting technology. He was suspended by the team awaiting testing of his B-sample.|$|E
5000|$|As {{a result}} of the failed drugs test, McMillan was banned from {{competitive}} sport by the National Anti-Doping Panel for two years. McMillan had tested positive for the cocaine metabolite <b>benzoylecgonine.</b> The suspension was appealed by McMillan, who protested that he had consumed cocaine unwittingly having had his drink spiked at a party. The appeal panel upheld the original decision, with his suspension due to run until 17 December 2016. The chief executive of UKAD stressed the importance of [...] "strict liability", meaning that athletes are responsible for all substances entering their bodies.|$|E
50|$|Cocaine is {{extensively}} metabolized, {{primarily in}} the liver, with only about 1% excreted unchanged in the urine. The metabolism is dominated by hydrolytic ester cleavage, so the eliminated metabolites consist mostly of <b>benzoylecgonine</b> (BE), the major metabolite, and other significant metabolites in lesser amounts such as ecgonine methyl ester (EME) and ecgonine. Further minor metabolites of cocaine include norcocaine, p-hydroxycocaine, m-hydroxycocaine, p-hydroxybenzoylecgonine (pOHBE), and m-hydroxybenzoylecgonine. If consumed with alcohol, cocaine combines with alcohol in the liver to form cocaethylene. Studies have suggested cocaethylene is both more euphoric, and has a higher cardiovascular toxicity than cocaine by itself.|$|E
50|$|David Allen {{was banned}} from rugby league for 12 months by the Rugby Football League after testing {{positive}} for <b>Benzoylecgonine,</b> a metabolite of cocaine. Allen argued that he has taken the drugs accidentally and the RFL accepted and only issued the 12-month ban. However, UK Sport appealed and asked the RFL to reconsider their punishment and apply the mandatory two-year ban in the World Anti-Doping Code. It was the first appeal lodged by UK Sport against a sanction imposed by a national governing body on an athlete who failed a drugs test. After serving his ban, he joined Oldham Roughyeds ahead of the 2009 season.|$|E
50|$|In May 2014, Andretti Autosport {{announced}} that Montagny would race {{for them in}} the inaugural season of the FIA Formula E Championship in 2014-15. He raced for the team in Beijing and Putrajaya, scoring a podium in Beijing and scoring 18 points overall in the two races. However, he was replaced in Punta del Este by Jean-Éric Vergne. It was not immediately known why, but Montagny later admitted that he tested positive for <b>benzoylecgonine,</b> a cocaine derivative after the Putrajaya ePrix. In March 2015, Montagny was given a two-year ban from racing, and was also disqualified from the Putrajaya race, in which he initially placed fifteenth.|$|E
50|$|Lindholm {{quit his}} job as editor in chief for Kamratposten in May 2011 after being charged {{for the use of}} cocaine. Lindholm hosted the SVT program Tittarnas Wild Kids (Viewers' Wild Kids), a Wild Kids {{spin-off}} program which was mid-season at the time. Because of his prosecution, SVT pulled the remaining two episodes of the season from their schedule. Lindholm has denied the allegations. A random police test after a football game at Råsunda showed trace amounts of <b>benzoylecgonine</b> in his urine. The trial began on 5 September the same year. He was found guilty on 12 September and sentenced against his denials to pay a fine.|$|E
50|$|The Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office {{concludes that}} Irons {{died from a}} cardiac arrest due to a severe {{blockage}} of a main artery of the heart. The official autopsy report lists also a second cause of death as “acute mixed drug ingestion”, listing alprazolam, methadone, <b>benzoylecgonine</b> (a metabolite of cocaine) and traces of methamphetamine as the drugs found in Andy's body {{at the time of}} his death. Initial press releases cited Dengue fever as the cause of Irons' death; however, the autopsy report conducted by the Tarrant County Medical Examiner's office were negative for Dengue and other flavivirus. It is unclear why rumors that Dengue fever contributed to Irons' death proliferated.|$|E
5000|$|The defense also {{intended}} to bring {{before the jury}} details about Schmitz, including that he had faced {{more than two dozen}} criminal cases since turning 18; his past convictions for fifth-degree assault and domestic assault; that methamphetamine and <b>benzoylecgonine</b> (a cocaine metabolite), which when combined can lead to unpredictable and unwarranted violence, were found in his system; and that he had a tattoo of a swastika on his chest. Schmitz's brother said Schmitz was not a racist, but that he had become a {{part of a group of}} white supremacists while in prison when he was younger. Freeman dismissed the tattoo as irrelevant, saying McDonald [...] "couldn't see it, nor could anyone else ... It adds a little bit of sensationalism to the case, obviously." ...|$|E
