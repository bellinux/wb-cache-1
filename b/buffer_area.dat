The BDOS handled some of the buffering of data from the diskette, but before CP/M 3.0 it assumed a disk sector size fixed at 128 bytes, as used on single-density 8-inch floppy disks. Since most 5.25-inch disk formats used larger sectors, the blocking and deblocking and the management of a disk <b>buffer</b> <b>area</b> was handled by model-specific code in the BIOS.|$|E

When Russian troops evacuated Wallachia, Lakeman, who was serving under Omar Pasha, was appointed to a command position in the region, becoming police chief in Bucharest (September 1854).

50|$|A fully {{featured}} Forth system with all source code will compile itself, a technique commonly called meta-compilation by Forth programmers (although the term doesn't exactly match meta-compilation {{as it is}} normally defined).

The compiler's words use specially named versions of fetch and store that can be redirected to a <b>buffer</b> <b>area</b> in memory. The <b>buffer</b> <b>area</b> simulates or accesses a memory area beginning at a different address than the code buffer. Such compilers define words to access both the target computer's memory, and the host (compiling) computer's memory.|$|E
