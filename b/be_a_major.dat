5|$|A few adult beetles may {{overlap between}} {{the spring and}} summer populations, but most adults from the earlier {{emergence}} die before the end of summer. Both adult and larval tansy beetles are unble to detect their host plant, or each other, at a distance, either by smell, sight or a combination of the two. Starvation is thus likely to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> contributor to mortality when beetles wander away from their host and become lost.|$|E
5|$|Although ecplised by Scots Baronial and Gothic forms, Neo-classicism {{continued}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> style into the nineteenth century. William Henry Playfair (1790–1857) was the designer {{of many of}} Edinburgh's neoclassical landmarks in the New Town. Two of his finest works are the National Gallery of Scotland and the Royal Scottish Academy, which are situated in the centre of Edinburgh. However, the figure most associated with the classical style was Alexander 'Greek' Thomson (1817–75). Working mainly in Glasgow, {{he turned away from}} the Gothic style toward that of the ancient Greeks and Egyptians, {{as can be seen in}} the temple and columns that were part of the Caledonia Road Church (1856).|$|E

The golden jackal, particularly, can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> {{competitor}} to the cat. When it encounters a threat, the jungle cat will vocalise before engaging in attack, producing sounds like small roars – a behavior uncommon for {{the other members of}} Felis. The meow of the jungle cat is also somewhat lower than that of a typical domestic cat. The jungle cat can host parasites such as Haemaphysalis and Heterophyes species.|$|E

Agriculture continues to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> business, if no longer a major employer because of mechanisation. Light industries are based in towns such as Bridgwater and Yeovil. The towns of Taunton and Shepton Mallet manufacture cider, although the acreage of apple orchards is less than it once was.|$|E
5|$|Fatalities and {{injuries}} at this race proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> {{turning point in}} both the 1994 season, and {{in the development of}} Formula One itself, particularly with regard to safety.

Other incidents saw driver Rubens Barrichello injured and several mechanics and spectators injured. In terms of driver fatalities, this was Formula One's darkest weekend since two drivers were killed at the 1960 Belgian Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|Greater Manchester {{is mainly}} urban, {{and is one}} of the most densely {{populated}} regions in Europe. In the second half of the 18thcentury, the Industrial Revolution played an important role in the growth and development of Manchester and its surrounding area, and industry continues to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> part of the region's economy. There are few buildings surviving from before the Industrial Revolution, but many from the 19th and 20thcenturies. The bedrock consists mainly of Carboniferous sandstones, including millstone grit, which is a major source of building material for the region's churches. The superficial deposits are of boulder clay, which provides material for making bricks.|$|E

5|$|Historically {{the town}} {{was known as a}} major centre for the {{production}} of textiles (mainly linen) after the industrial revolution and it continued to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> producer of textiles until that industry steadily declined in the 1990s and 2000s. The development of the 'new city' of Craigavon had a major impact on Lurgan in the 1960s when much industry was attracted to the area. The expansion of Craigavon's Rushmere Retail Park in the 2000s has affected the town's retail trade further.|$|E
5|$|In 1584 Báthory allowed Zamoyski {{to execute}} Samuel Zborowski, whose death {{sentence}} for treason and murder had been pending for roughly a decade. This political conflict between Báthory and the Zborowski family, framed as {{the clash between}} the monarch and the nobility, would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> recurring controversy in internal Polish politics for many years. In external politics, Báthory was considering another war with Russia, but his plans were delayed {{to the lack of}} support from the Sejm, which refused to pass requested tax raises.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Grant was {{unsuccessful}} in obtaining the Republican presidential nomination {{for a third}} term. Facing severe investment reversals and dying of throat cancer, he wrote his memoirs, which proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> critical and financial success. His death in 1885 prompted an outpouring in support of national unity. Historical assessments of Grant's legacy have varied considerably over the years. His popular reputation focuses on his drinking, which historians agree did not adversely affect his military campaigns. Early historical evaluations were mostly negative about Grant's presidency. Scholars continue to rank his presidency below the average, but modern appreciation for his support for civil rights has helped improve his standing.|$|E
