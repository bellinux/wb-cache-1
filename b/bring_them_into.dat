5|$|Fortune's novels all {{follow the}} same basic theme: a heroine — a priestess and initiatrix who is magically {{experienced}} and assertive — who meets a man and saves him from himself. In her later novels this entails the duos reconstructing or revitalising a ritual space and working magical rituals to channel cosmic forces and <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> balance.|$|E

The fledgling is employed by Sebastian LaCroix (voiced by Andy Milder), prince of Los Angeles' vampires. The fledgling's travels through the vampire world <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> contact with other undead creatures such as the deformed information broker Bertram Tung, the Anarch Smiling Jack, and the mentally-unstable Voerman sisters, Jeanette and Therese.

5|$|Ireland {{has been}} a member of NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) {{programme}} and Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) since 1999, but has not applied to join NATO as a member state due to its traditional policy of military neutrality. Ireland participates in the alliance's PfP Planning and Review Process (PARP), which aims to increase the interoperability of the Irish military, the Defence Forces, with other NATO member states and <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> line with accepted international standards so as to successfully deploy with other professional military forces on peacekeeping operations overseas. Ireland supplied a small number of troops to the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan (2001–2014) and supports the ongoing NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR).|$|E

25|$|According to the ego (or cognitive) {{depletion}} {{theory of}} impulsivity, self-control {{refers to the}} capacity for altering one's own responses, especially to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> line with standards such as ideals, values, morals, and social expectations, and to support the pursuit of long-term goals. Self-control enables a person to restrain or override one response, thereby making a different response possible.|$|E

25|$|This {{position}} {{was accepted by}} the majority {{of the members of the}} PCd’I, but it was to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> conflict with the Comintern when in 1921 the latter adopted a new tactic: that of the 'united front' with reformist organisations to fight for reforms and even to form a 'workers' government'. Bordiga regarded this as a reversion to the failed tactics which the pre-war Social Democrats had adopted and which had led to them becoming reformist.|$|E
25|$|In {{reaction}} to the redundancy of the dictatorship, the senate party (or optimates) were {{in need of a}} new emergency power that would not fall under the public rights of provocatio and intercessio (or Veto). The populares under Tiberius Gracchus had challenged the power of the senate and began with a program of land reform. Because he was a Tribune of the Plebs, the senate needed extraordinary power to stop him, since Gracchus was able to appeal his demands directly to the people and <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> law.|$|E
25|$|In early autumn 1692, Arnout Viele, a loyal English-speaking Dutchman, and a {{party of}} eleven companions—Christians, Shawnee, and a few loyal Delaware guides—from Esopus were sent out by the Governor of New York in order to {{establish}} trade relationships with the Shawnee to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> the English sphere of influence. Viele understood native American languages which made him valuable as an interpreter. Viele is credited with being the first white man to travel and explore western Pennsylvania and the Upper Ohio Valley. Viele even made contact with nations located as far west as the Wabash River border.|$|E

25|$|This {{statement}} {{implies that}} thermal equilibrium is an equivalence relation {{on the set}} of thermodynamic systems under consideration. Systems are said to be in equilibrium if the small, random exchanges between them (e.g. Brownian motion) do not lead to a net change in energy. This law is tacitly assumed in every measurement of temperature. Thus, if one seeks to decide if two bodies are at the same temperature, {{it is not necessary to}} <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> contact and measure any changes of their observable properties in time. The law provides an empirical definition of temperature and justification for the construction of practical thermometers.|$|E

Then on 2 June the packet ship Swallow arrived from the Cape of Good Hope with the news than a convoy of Dutch East Indiamen had left the Cape, sailing for the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|Early in 298 BC a Lucanian {{delegation}} went to Rome {{to ask the}} Romans to {{take them}} under their protection as the Samnites, having failed to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> an alliance, had invaded their territory. Rome agreed to an alliance. Fetials were sent to Samnium to order the Samnites to leave Lucania. The Samnites threatened their safety and Rome declared war. Dionysius of Halicarnassus thought {{that the cause of}} the war was not Roman compassion for the wronged, but fear of the strength the Samnites would gain if they subdued the Lucanians. Oakley suggests that Rome might well have deliberately sought a new war with Samnium by allying with her enemies.|$|E

25|$|With {{the onset}} of World War II, the Ministry of Supply in the United Kingdom {{established}} a BW program at Porton Down, headed by the microbiologist Paul Fildes. The research was championed by Winston Churchill and soon tularemia, anthrax, brucellosis, and botulism toxins had been effectively weaponized. In particular, Gruinard Island in Scotland, was contaminated with anthrax during a series of extensive tests for the next 56 years. Although the UK never offensively used the biological weapons it developed on its own, its program {{was the first to}} successfully weaponize a variety of deadly pathogens and <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> industrial production. Other nations, notably France and Japan, had begun their own biological weapons programs.|$|E
25|$|By {{the first}} half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was {{effectively}} unchallenged as the sole English translation in current use in Protestant churches, and was so dominant that the Roman Catholic Church in England issued in 1750 a revision of the 1610 Douay-Rheims Bible by Richard Challoner that was very much closer to the Authorized Version than to the original. However, general standards of spelling, punctuation, typesetting, capitalization and grammar had changed radically in the 100 years since the first edition of the Authorized Version, and all printers in the market were introducing continual piecemeal changes to their Bible texts to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> line with current practice – and with public expectations of standardized spelling and grammatical construction.|$|E
25|$|In 1526, the Bohemian estates elected Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg. The fervent Catholicism of {{its members}} was to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> {{conflict}} in Bohemia, and then in Prague, where Protestant ideas were gaining popularity. These problems were not pre-eminent under Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II, elected King of Bohemia in 1576, who chose Prague as his home. He lived in the Prague Castle, where his court welcomed not only astrologers and magicians but also scientists, musicians, and artists. Rudolf was an art lover too, and Prague became the capital of European culture. This was a prosperous period for the city: famous people living there in that age include the astronomers Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler, the painter Arcimboldo, the alchemists Edward Kelley and John Dee, the poet Elizabeth Jane Weston, and others.|$|E

It was addressed to Yang Ch'ing, Lo Chih, T'ang Kuan-po, and Yüan Ch'eng. On 29 June 1430, the Xuande Emperor issued his orders for the seventh voyage. It was addressed to Zheng He and others. The Xuanzong Shilu reported that Zheng He, Wang Jinghong, and others were sent to far-lying foreign lands to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> deference and submission.

The high operational tempo from the Operation Resolute and Operation Sovereign Borders border protection and asylum seeker interception operations, combined with design flaws and poor maintenance, resulted in the ships suffering from hull fracturing around the engineering spaces, mechanical defects, and corrosion issues. DMS's contract to provide in-service support will be terminated in 2017, and the patrol boats are undergoing a major refit in Singapore to reinforce the hull. Two s have been chartered to supplement naval patrol boat availability during the refit cycle, and plans to replace the Armidales with an enlarged class of offshore combatant vessel have been accelerated to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> service by the early 2020s.|$|E
