40|$|Human {{leukocyte}} antigen (HLA) -G is upregulated on the <b>bronchial</b> epithelium of <b>asthma</b> {{patients and}} genetic polymorphism affecting expression of HLA-G {{has been reported}} to influence susceptibility to asthma. As the NK cell receptor KIR 2 DL 4 {{has been reported to}} induce interferon gamma (IFNγ) secretion when ligated with HLA-G, we postulated that the 9 A/ 10 A genetic polymorphism of KIR 2 DL 4 which influences receptor structure may influence susceptibility to asthma. KIR 2 DL 4 genotypes were determined in two cohorts of children (n= 219 and n= 1356) in whom total serum IgE, allergen-specific IgE, atopy, <b>bronchial</b> reactivity and <b>asthma</b> symptoms had been studied between birth and 14 years. No reproducible associations with KIR 2 DL 4 genotype were identified, leading us to conclude that the KIR 2 DL 4 9 A/ 10 A polymorphism has no influence on susceptibility to asthma...|$|R

500|$|Wilkinson {{suffered}} {{for most of}} her life from <b>bronchial</b> <b>asthma,</b> which she aggravated over the years by heavy smoking and overwork. She had often been ill during the war, and had collapsed during a visit to Prague in 1946. On 25 January 1947 she attended the opening of the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. [...] The winter of 1946–47 was exceptionally cold, and the ceremony was held out of doors. Shortly afterwards, Wilkinson developed pneumonia; on 3 February she was found in her London flat in a coma, and on 6 February 1947 she died in St Mary's Hospital, Paddington. At the inquest the coroner gave the cause of death as [...] "heart failure following emphysema, with acute bronchitis and bronchial pneumonia, accelerated by barbiturate poisoning". Wilkinson had been taking a combination of drugs for several months, to combat both her asthma and insomnia; the coroner believed she had inadvertently taken an overdose of barbiturates. With no evidence to indicate that the overdose was deliberate, he recorded a verdict of accidental death. Despite this, speculation that Wilkinson had committed suicide has persisted, the reasons cited being the failure of her personal relationship with Herbert Morrison and her likely fate in a rumoured cabinet reshuffle. In their 1973 biography of Morrison, Bernard Donoughue and G. W. Jones suggest that, given Wilkinson's poor health, the burdens of her ministerial office became too much for her. However, the lack of conclusive evidence divides historians about Wilkinson's intention to take her own life.|$|E

2500|$|The {{last three}} Tests were drawn, {{but not without}} incident; Wisden wrote [...] "as the tour progressed he took more knocks than most from the bowlers. Nobody relished the short-pitched bowling, but Barrington showed his dislike more than most {{and as a result}} became a special target. Nevertheless, he fought bravely". Barrington proved {{vulnerable}} as his expressive face encouraged the fast bowlers and he ducked late, making him look ungainly. His roommate Ray Illingworth said he cried at night because of his injuries and Hall marked him out for his most hostile bowling. Barrington made 16 and 4 in the Third Test and was barely declared fit for the Fourth Test after suffering from <b>bronchial</b> <b>asthma</b> and being hit on the elbow by Hall. He retired hurt for a few minutes, but declined to go to hospital and resumed his innings even though he could not play any strokes, making 5 runs in a stand of 39 with Dave Allen and making a duck in the second innings. A century against Berbice helped him return to form and even though he was forced to retire hurt when hit on the knuckles by Hall he returned to hook and cut his way to 69 in the last Test. England won the series 1–0, the first time they had won a Test series in the Caribbean and Barrington's 420 runs (46.66) were an important part of this victory.|$|E
2500|$|Westfall {{was born}} in 1919 in Hamtramck, Michigan. His father {{abandoned}} the family when Westfall was two years old which necessitated he and his older sister living in foster homes until his mother was able to move them to Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1924. There, Westfall's mother worked 14-hour days in a laundry six days per week and the children worked, too, to make ends meet. At age 10 Westfall started as a caddy and worked other jobs while his sister sewed as they struggled to survive during the Great Depression. They lived in a tiny second-floor apartment on Greene Street [...] "in {{the shadow of the}} Michigan Stadium"-a location perhaps affecting the future. Showing leadership at an early age, Westfall was the class president from 8th grade at Tappan Junior High School through the 12th grade at Ann Arbor High School. Demonstrating a remarkable talent for athletics, Westfall starred in football, basketball, baseball and track at Ann Arbor High School. Engaging in sports at all was remarkable due to severe <b>bronchial</b> <b>asthma</b> that affected him from the age of nine throughout his entire life. He was diagnosed by doctors at the University of Michigan Hospital as having one of the worst cases of asthma that they had ever encountered. Ted Kennedy, who played center in front of Westfall for the four years (1938–1941) they were at Michigan together recalled that Westfall [...] "had asthma attacks so bad he could hardly breathe" [...] but that [...] "he was a very courageous player."

40|$|In a {{retrospective}} analysis {{of the history of}} 1, 700 asthmatic children, 167 (9. 8 %) were found to have had bronchiolitis during the first 2 years of life. These 167 cases with asthma and bronchiolitis were matched against 215 selected cases of asthma without bronchiolitis. Both groups attended our Ambulatory Care Unit for Asthma. Data were collected from the clinical cards of the children. Asthmatics who had bronchiolitis were found to have an earlier onset of asthma (p < 0. 001), earlier resolution of symptoms (p < 0. 05 total; p < 0. 01 females), and less evidence of atopy (p < 0. 005). It is suggested therefore that the <b>bronchial</b> hyperreactivity in <b>asthma</b> following bronchiolitis may have different underlying mechanisms than in the typical atopic case, without preceding bronchiolitis. Long-term follow-up studies in infants with bronchiolitis are still necessary in order to clarify the process by which bronchiolitis predisposes to <b>bronchial</b> hyperreactivity and <b>asthma.</b> The consequences of the viral infection itself may lead to pathophysiological processes that promote bronchial hyperreactivity. On the contrary, an underlying condition of bronchial hyperreactivity could be the "primum movens" of the bronchiolitis itself...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of review: Bronchial thermoplasty, which {{involves}} {{the delivery of}} radio frequency energy to the airways to reduce airway smooth muscle mass, has been recently introduced {{for the treatment of}} severe asthma. This review summarizes the preclinical development, efficacy and adverse effects of bronchial thermoplasty. In addition, the potential mechanisms of action and place in management of severe asthma are discussed. Recent findings: The efficacy and adverse profile of bronchial thermoplasty has been assessed in three randomized controlled trials, the first two of which showed clinical benefits of bronchial thermoplasty compared with usual care in patients with moderate or severe asthma. The third trial reports the results of a comparison with sham bronchial thermoplasty in 288 adults with severe <b>asthma.</b> <b>Bronchial</b> thermoplasty improved <b>asthma</b> quality of life questionnaire scores compared with sham bronchial thermoplasty; in the posttreatment period, there were fewer severe exacerbations and emergency department visits. Bronchial thermoplasty causes short-term increases in asthma-related morbidity. Follow-up data to date support the long-term safety of the procedure. Summary: Bronchial thermoplasty has a role in the management of patients with severe asthma who have uncontrolled symptoms despite current therapies. Future studies need to identify factors that predict a beneficial clinical response. </p...|$|R
