5|$|Because it isn't {{as close}} to its star as its sister planets Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c, the Kepler team {{suggests}} that its light density may come from a large hydrogen and helium atmosphere that has not <b>been</b> <b>blown</b> away by the stellar wind.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{existing}} fortifications in this location. The main existing fort, King Charles's Castle, {{had been built}} in the 1550s but was poorly sited and had <b>been</b> <b>blown</b> up by its defenders when Blake's forces took the island. There was also a small blockhouse beneath it, dating from the 16th century, and the new castle was built on top of this preexisting site.|$|E
5|$|With {{approximately}} {{two minutes of}} normal time left, the referee's whistle blew for an infringement.

5|$|A {{report by}} an amateur radio {{operator}} {{who claimed to}} have received a faint SOS signal from Star Dust initially raised hopes that there might have been survivors, but all subsequent attempts over the years to find the vanished flight failed. In the absence of any hard evidence, numerous theories arose —including rumours of sabotage (compounded by the later disappearance of two other aircraft also belonging to British South American Airways); speculation that the flight might have <b>been</b> <b>blown</b> up to destroy diplomatic documents being carried by passenger Paul Simpson; or even the suggestion that Star Dust might have been taken or destroyed by a UFO (an idea fuelled by unresolved questions about the flight's final Morse code message).|$|E
5|$|As {{champions of}} the Football League, Burnley {{qualified}} for the Charity Shield, then known as the Dewar Shield. Burnley's opponents were Tottenham Hotspur, who had finished sixth in the First Division and beaten Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup final. In what was the last match of the 1920–21 campaign, Burnley fell to a 0–2 loss at White Hart Lane on 16May 1921. The match was not without controversy, as the Burnley players claimed that the second goal should have been disallowed despite the Tottenham goalscorer being onside, maintaining that the whistle had already <b>been</b> <b>blown</b> by the referee.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{effectiveness}} of electronic deer whistles in scaring away sika deer {{that are likely to}} run onto roads, resulting in accidents. These whistles have been used in the U. S. A. and other countries. In this study, two types of deer whistles were tested: one that has a continuous tone with a fixed frequency (Whistle A) and the other that has an intermittent tone with a modulated frequency (Whistle B). To assess {{the effectiveness of}} the whistles in alerting deer, the deer's reactions to the whistles <b>were</b> observed by <b>blowing</b> the whistle from a fixed place that is visible to the deer when they appear by the roadside. For the control sample, deer's behavior when no whistle <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> <b>was</b> observed. When no whistle <b>was</b> <b>blown,</b> 51 % of the deer were on alert about the observers. When Whistle A <b>was</b> <b>blown,</b> 67 % of the deer were on alert; this figure increased to 95 % when Whistle B <b>was</b> <b>blown.</b> The time durations for which the deer were alert when no whistle <b>was</b> <b>blown,</b> Whistle A <b>was</b> <b>blown,</b> and Whistle B <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> <b>were</b> 20 %, 42 %, and 73 %, respectively. These results indicated that the deer whistles are effective in alerting deer, and that Whistle B is more effective than Whistle A. Vehicles can be equipped with deer whistles to alert deer about on-coming vehicles so as to prevent them from crossing roads, and consequently reduce deer-vehicle collisions. [URL]...|$|R
5|$|Bremner's last cap came against Denmark on 3 September 1975. An {{incident}} in Copenhagen {{after the game}} where several players were ejected from a nightclub for an alleged fight led to a lifetime ban from international football by the Scottish Football Association; four other players, Willie Young, Joe Harper, Pat McCluskey and Arthur Graham also were banned for life (Graham and Harper later had their bans overturned). Bremner maintained his innocence, stating that the incident had <b>been</b> <b>blown</b> out of proportion by the SFA.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies are {{distributed}} worldwide except Antarctica, totalling some 18,500 species. Of these, 775 are Nearctic; 7,700 Neotropical; 1,575 Palearctic; 3,650 Afrotropical; and 4,800 {{are distributed}} across the combined Oriental and Australian/Oceania regions. The monarch butterfly {{is native to}} the Americas, but {{in the nineteenth century}} or before, spread across the world, and is now found in Australia, New Zealand, other parts of Oceania, and the Iberian Peninsula. It is not clear how it dispersed; adults may have <b>been</b> <b>blown</b> by the wind or larvae or pupae may have been accidentally transported by humans, but the presence of suitable host plants in their new environment was a necessity for their successful establishment.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{producer}} R. W. Goodwin recalls {{being on}} {{location for the}} episode's opening scene, in which Detective Barbala is thrown from a window. The room used for the scene had two windows side-by-side, and one had been replaced with sugar glass for the stunt. When the false window was blown out to simulate someone being thrown through it, the crew found that the glass window beside the false one had also accidentally <b>been</b> <b>blown</b> out. The episode's key grip, Al Campbell, suggested that the next shot show Barbala's dog lying beside his body to explain the second window breaking.|$|E

25|$|Flutes can {{be played}} with several {{different}} air sources. Conventional flutes <b>are</b> <b>blown</b> with the mouth, although some cultures use nose flutes. The flue pipes of organs, which are acoustically similar to duct flutes, <b>are</b> <b>blown</b> by bellows or fans.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{instruments}} {{can be used}} to measure wind direction, such as the windsock and wind vane. Both of these instruments work by moving to minimize air resistance. The way a weather vane is pointed by prevailing winds indicates the direction from which the wind <b>is</b> <b>blowing.</b> The larger opening of a windsock faces the direction that the wind <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> from; its tail, with the smaller opening, points in the direction the wind <b>is</b> <b>blowing.</b>|$|R
5|$|Insects {{arrived on}} Surtsey soon after its formation, and were first {{detected}} in 1964. The original arrivals were flying insects, {{carried to the}} island by winds and their own power. Some were believed to have <b>been</b> <b>blown</b> across {{from as far away}} as mainland Europe. Later insect life arrived on floating driftwood, and both live animals and carcasses washed up on the island. When a large, grass-covered tussock was washed ashore in 1974, scientists took half of it for analysis and discovered 663 land invertebrates, mostly mites and springtails, the great majority of which had survived the crossing.|$|E
5|$|There {{remained}} {{the men of}} the Ross Sea Party, who were stranded at Cape Evans in McMurdo Sound, after Aurora had <b>been</b> <b>blown</b> from its anchorage and driven out to sea, unable to return. The ship, after a drift of many months, had returned to New Zealand. Shackleton travelled there to join Aurora, and sailed with her to the rescue of the Ross Sea party. This group, despite many hardships, had carried out its depot-laying mission to the full, but three lives had been lost, including that of its commander, Aeneas Mackintosh.|$|E
5|$|After the 'panic party' {{had taken}} to the boats and the ship {{appeared}} to be sinking, the U-boat approached to within 80 yards of her port quarter, whereupon Sanders ordered the White Ensign hoisted and Prize opened fire. Within {{a few minutes the}} submarine was on fire and her bows rose in the air, whilst Prize was further damaged. The U-boat disappeared from sight, and was believed to have been sunk by the crew of Prize and by several of the German crew (including her captain) who had <b>been</b> <b>blown</b> or jumped into the sea. However, neither of the crippled ships had sunk, with Prize being towed in flames back to Kinsale. U-93 struggled back to the Sylt nine days later.|$|E

5|$|Casualties {{were heavy}} on both sides, and both vessels were in such poor {{condition}} that each commander {{thought he had}} sunk his opponent. Most of La Vengeance rigging had <b>been</b> <b>blown</b> away; only the lower foremast, lower mizzenmast, and bowsprit were operational. Pitot set course for Curaçao {{and was forced to}} ground his vessel there to prevent her from sinking. The number of French casualties is somewhat unclear: official French accounts report 28 dead and 40 wounded, while accounts from Curaçao state that the French frigate had lost 160 men. Once Pitot reached Curaçao he was beset with further problems. La Vengeance remained out of action for months due to difficulties in acquiring support needed to repair the frigate from the Dutch officials there. A French expedition to seize the island brought the materiel needed to repair the frigate, but when asked to help attack the island Pitot refused and slipped away to Guadaloupe.|$|E
5|$|One of the French squadrons that {{operated}} in the Atlantic campaign of 1806 {{was the result}} of opportunity rather than strategy. After the Battle of Trafalgar, most of the French survivors had retreated to Cadiz, where they remained until Duckworth's blockade squadron abandoned the port in November 1805. Although Duckworth's ships were replaced by forces under Lord Collingwood, the replacements were inadequate and on 26 February 1806, while the blockade squadron, which had been pulled back in the hope of luring the French out of the port, had <b>been</b> <b>blown</b> off station, four frigates and a brig escaped. Chased by the British frigate HMS Hydra, Commodore Louis La-Marre-la-Meillerie refused battle and abandoned the brig Furet to the British in his haste to escape.|$|E
5|$|Deserts {{are formed}} by {{weathering}} processes as large {{variations in temperature}} between day and night put strains on the rocks which consequently break in pieces. Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods. Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor is further eroded by the wind. This picks up particles of sand and dust and wafts them aloft in sand or dust storms. Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface. Rocks are smoothed down, and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits. The grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high in billowing sand dunes. Other deserts are flat, stony plains where all the fine material has <b>been</b> <b>blown</b> away and the surface consists of a mosaic of smooth stones. These areas are known as desert pavements and little further erosion takes place. Other desert features include rock outcrops, exposed bedrock and clays once deposited by flowing water. Temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate. There may be underground sources {{of water in the}} form of springs and seepages from aquifers. Where these are found, oases can occur.|$|E
50|$|In the 1806 Vellore Mutiny, {{beginning}} with a night massacre of British officers and soldiers, with many sepoys killed during the suppression, 6 individuals were sentenced to <b>be</b> <b>blown</b> from the guns.

In 1819, six deserters who had joined the ousted rajah of the annexed Kingdom of Nagpur were apprehended by the British and <b>were</b> <b>blown</b> from the guns on 7 February. In 1832 Bangalore, a conspiracy allegedly designed to exterminate all Europeans was discovered.

5|$|Some bridges {{over the}} Sava were blown before all {{elements}} of the 7th and 8th Border Regiments had withdrawn, but some soldiers were able to swim across, the rest being captured by the advancing Germans. German patrols reached the Drava at Ptuj, and further east at Ormož they found the bridge had <b>been</b> <b>blown.</b> Elements of the XLIX Mountain Corps had pushed forward to Poljana and Dravograd. The German troops received close air support from dive bombers and fighters during their advance, while medium bombers hit targets throughout the 7th Army area. The 4th Fighter Regiment clashed several times with German aircraft on 8 April without result. Three Blenheims of the Yugoslav 8th Bomber Regiment again flew a mission to attack a target in southern Austria, escorted by 4th Fighter Regiment Hurricanes, {{but the rest of}} the 8th Bomber Regiment was awaiting orders to bomb a rebelling Yugoslav regiment of the neighbouring 4th Army in Bjelovar; the orders were subsequently cancelled. During the day, the Italian 3rd Alpine Group captured Kranjska Gora at the headwaters of the Sava in the sector of Mountain Detachment Triglavski. The German orders for the following day were for LI Infantry Corps to force a crossing of the Drava near Varazdin and advance on Zagreb, while XLIX Mountain Corps were to drive towards Celje.|$|E
5|$|The MOD {{commissioned}} {{a series of}} multi-beam sonar surveys to image the wreck and appraise its condition. The high-resolution sonograms showed Royal Oak to be lying almost upside down with her top works forced into the seabed. The tip of the bow had <b>been</b> <b>blown</b> off by U-47s first torpedo and a gaping hole on the starboard flank {{was the result of}} the triple strike from her second successful salvo. Following several years of delays, Briggs Marine was contracted by the MoD to conduct the task of pumping off the remaining oil. Royal Oaks mid-construction conversion to fuel oil had placed her fuel tanks in unconventional positions, complicating operations. By 2006, all double bottom tanks had been cleared and the task of removing oil from the inner wing tanks with cold cutting equipment began the next year. By 2010, some 1600 tonnes of fuel oil had been removed, and the wreck was declared to be no longer actively releasing oil into Scapa Flow. Operations continue at a reduced pace to tackle the oil known to be remaining (state for 2012).|$|E
5|$|Unbeknownst {{to either}} Villaret or Cornwallis, the British Channel Fleet {{was also at}} sea, having sailed from Spithead on 12 June with 14 ships {{of the line and}} 11 smaller vessels under the command of Admiral Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport. Bridport had been tasked with {{ensuring}} the safety of a convoy of transports, commanded by Commodore Sir John Borlase Warren, which carried a French Royalist army to Quiberon with the intention of triggering a counter-revolution in Brittany. This force consisted of an additional three ships of the line, six frigates and more than 50 transports containing 2,500 French Royalists. The voyage across the English Channel and around the Ushant headland took seven days, the combined fleet and expeditionary force arriving off Belle Île on 19 June. Bridport had ordered Warren to take his convoy on to Quiberon while {{the main body of the}} Channel Fleet stood further out to sea to intercept any attack by the French Atlantic Fleet, which Bridport assumed would advance southwards from Brest. What the British admiral did not know was that not only had the French fleet sailed a week earlier, but that they were still at sea – Villaret's ships having <b>been</b> <b>blown</b> southwards by a severe gale on 18 June and forced to take shelter in the anchorage off Belle Île.|$|E
