As a result of Coucoulas introducing thermosonic <b>bonding</b> <b>lead</b> wires in the early 1960s, its applications and scientific investigations by researchers throughout the world have grown as confirmed by the thousands of Google search-sites.

40|$|A common {{approach}} for joining silicon - structured using anisotropic etching - and glass is anodic bonding. The {{combination of these}} two techniques (etching and <b>bonding)</b> <b>lead</b> to problems concerning {{the reliability of the}} resulting microelectromechanical systems during mechanical loading caused by mechanical failure starting at sharp interfacial corners conditional to etching technology. Therefore a failure concept is required that can be applied for the design of reliable microsystems. Based on the fracture mechanic concept of critical stress intensity factors it is possible to develop such a criteria for fracture initiation at interface corners of silicon/glass anodic bonds. For examination of this approach we designed and fabricated a series of special test structures -silicon/glass anodic bonds with different notch geometries. These structures are based on typical structures found in microelectromechanical systems. We performed a large number of symmetric and asymmetric four-point flexure tests at different temperatures and loading rates to eliminate the influence of sub critical crack growth. The measured critical failure stresses were used as input data for a finite element model to calculate the singular stress field of the interface notch tip and its corresponding notch stress intensity factors A 1 C (mode I) and A 2 C (modeII). Using the results of the asymmetric four-point flexure tests it can be shown that failure is mostly characterised by A 1 C. Furthermore, using optical and scanning electron microscopy we were able to show, that the crack path is well approx imated by the path of maximum radial stresses calculated using finite element analysis. The so determined A 1 C values may then be used to characterise the strength of a microsystem during the layout phase; meaning that already in the stage of design reliability of a microsystem can be assured...|$|E

40|$|We have {{examined}} multiple bonds (σ, π, and δ) to transition metals {{and find that}} intra-atomic exchange forces on these metals are crucial for correct prediction of ground states and that a proper description of these terms is required for a quantitative understanding of bond energies. Our calculations on models for bridged Fe porphyrin dimers show that intra-atomic exchange forces on the Fe's are critical to the explanation for the dramatic differences in the Fe-Fe coupling for µ-oxo and µ-nitrido bridged Fe porphyrin dimers. The qualitative bonding concepts obtained are used to predict properties of the µ-carbido bridged Fe porphyrin dimer. In most cases, the interactions responsible for <b>bonding</b> <b>lead</b> to antifer'romagnetic coupling between the d orbitals localized on adjacent centers, resulting in overall low-spin couplings. However, some extended metal systems (eg. metallic Ni) lead to net ferromagnetic interactions between d orbitals localized on different centers. In order to elucidate these effects, we {{have examined}} the direct and indirect d-d couplings in the Ni_ 4 cluster {{as a function of}} bond distance. We find that ferromagnetic coupling dominates in a region of bond distance around the bulk Ni value of 2. 5 Å with antiferromagnetic coupling dominating for short R (by 2. 0 Å) and for long R (by 3. 5 Å). The dominant interactions responsible for ferromagnetic coupling involve spin polarization of the conduction band (slike), supporting a model for ferromagnetism in bulk metallic systems very similar to the Ruderman-Kittel model for magnetic impurities. The dimers Cr_ 2 and Mo_ 2 provide the most dramatic illustration of the importance of exchange forces in bonding. With six unpaired electrons on each atom, there is the potential for up to six covalent bonds. However, formation of d-d covalent bonds requires a concomitant loss in intra-atomic d-d exchange energy. The net result is a double well where the long-R minimum (3 Å is dominated by s-s pairing (no loss of intra-atomic d-d terms) while the short-R minimum (1. 7 to 1. 9 Å) involves a strong quintuple bond of d orbitals plus an antibonding s -s interaction. To properly handle the intra-atomic exchange terms during this transition from long R with local high-spin coupling to small R with dominant singlet pairing within bonding pairs presents a formidable challenge to (2. 6 initio computation. To carry out such studies, we have extended the GVB and related approaches of ab initio calculations and have also developed a simple approximate method of including the electron correlation missing in GVB wavefunctions that provides a quantitatively accurate description of these systems. The effects studied here should be of comparable importance for multiple bonds involving transition metals, lanthanides, and actinides bonding {{to each other and to}} such ligands as CR_ 2, CR, O, N, and NR. Correlation terms beyond GVB are most important for the least electronegative ligands. Thus, the proper treatment of intra-atomic exchange and of interatomic d-d coupling should be of considerable importance in studies of heterogeneous and homogeneous catalytic systems. ...|$|E
