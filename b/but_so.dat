5|$|After Ueshiba left Hokkaidō in 1919, he met and {{was profoundly}} {{influenced}} by Onisaburo Deguchi, the {{spiritual leader of}} the Ōmoto-kyō religion (a neo-Shinto movement) in Ayabe. One of the primary features of Ōmoto-kyō is its emphasis on the attainment of utopia during one's life. This was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to {{those who seek to}} harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> is the attacker.|$|E
5|$|But, the {{defendant}} {{does not have}} a right to a jury in stacked misdemeanor prosecutions, even if the cumulative authorized imprisonment exceeds six months, as long as the actual sentence does not. Factors other than actual and authorized sentences may be relevant to seriousness, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> far the Court has pushed back against expanding the jury right.|$|E
5|$|French breeders of polled Limousins {{claimed that}} the breed {{standard}} that prevented their animals being recorded in the French Herd Book provided an unfair export advantage to foreign countries {{that do not have}} similar restrictions. The French recording ban was removed in July 2007 with the introduction of the Purebred class, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> far no polled Limousin have yet been accepted and registered as Full French.|$|E

5|$|Otho and Vitellius {{realized}} the potential {{threat posed by}} the Flavian faction. With four legions at his disposal, Vespasian commanded a strength of nearly 80,000 soldiers. His position in Judaea further granted him {{the advantage of being}} nearest to the vital province of Egypt, which controlled the grain supply to Rome. His brother Titus Flavius Sabinus II, as city prefect, commanded the entire city garrison of Rome. Tensions among the Flavian troops ran high <b>but</b> <b>so</b> long as either Galba or Otho remained in power, Vespasian refused to take action.|$|E
5|$|Regarding air transport, Aarhus {{is served}} by the Aarhus Airport in Tirstrup about 35km {{northeast}} of the city centre. There has been much discussion about constructing a new airport closer to the city for many years, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> far, no plans have been realised. In August 2014, the city council officially initiated a process to assert the viability of a new international airport. A small seaplane now operates four flights daily between Aarhus harbour and Copenhagen harbour.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese were {{intrigued}} with European technology, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> were visiting Europeans of Chinese technology. In 1584, Abraham Ortelius (1527–1598) featured in his atlas Theatrum Orbis Terrarum the peculiar Chinese innovation of mounting masts and sails onto carriages, just like Chinese ships. Gonzales de Mendoza also mentioned this {{a year later}} – noting even the designs of them on Chinese silken robes – while Gerardus Mercator (1512–94) featured them in his atlas, John Milton (1608–74) {{in one of his}} famous poems, and Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest (1739–801) in the writings of his travel diary in China.|$|E

5|$|The Haraldskær Woman (or Haraldskjaer Woman) is a bog {{body of a}} woman found {{naturally}} {{preserved in}} a bog in Jutland, Denmark, and dating from about 490 BC (pre-Roman Iron Age). Workers found the body in 1835 while excavating peat on the Haraldskær Estate. The anaerobic conditions and acids of the peat bog contributed to the body's excellent preservation. Not only was the intact skeleton found, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> were the skin and internal organs. Scientists settled disputes about the age and identity of this well preserved body in 1977, when radiocarbon dating determined conclusively that the woman's death occurred around the 5th century BC.|$|E
5|$|The North Vietnamese {{response}} to {{the threat posed by}} the sensors was swift. If PAVN troops could detect the general location of a sensor, they immediately began to search out others and destroy them. Another response was to simply avoid them. The final evolution of anti-sensor measures was to attempt to deceive them. The chief protection of the sensors proved to be the dense foliage that covered the majority of the logistical system, turning the enemy's chief protection against him. Doubtless, PAVN troops negated the effects of many sensors, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> many of them were sown over such {{a long period of time}} that the majority survived.|$|E
5|$|What {{is perhaps}} more {{surprising}} is that Prince of Wales returned to British ownership. There is an entry {{for her in}} the supplemental (i.e., late addition) pages for the 1797 volume.

5|$|A new bow type, {{in which}} bone {{reinforcements}} cover {{the handle of}} the bow as well as the tips, may have developed in Central Asia during the 3rd to 2nd century BCE, with earliest finds from the area of Lake Baikal. Fittings from this type of bow appear right across Asia from Korea to the Crimea. Such bows with reinforcement of both grip and siyahs have been called “Hun,” “Hunnic” or “Hsiung-nu” composite bows. Huns did use such bows, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> did many other peoples; Rausing termed this type the 'Qum-Darya Bow' from the Han Chinese type-site at the frontier post of Loulan, {{at the mouth of the}} Qum Darya river, dated by analogy between c. 1st century BCE and the 3rd century CE.|$|E
5|$|Another pitfall trap form {{unrelated}} to the Sarraceniaceae family are the urns of bromeliad leaves that are formed when leaves are tightly packed together in a rosette, collecting water and trapping insects. Unlike Brocchinia reducta, which has been proven to produce at least one digestive enzyme and can therefore be considered carnivorous, the epiphytic Catopsis berteroniana has little evidence supporting the claims that it is carnivorous. It is able to attract and kill prey and the trichomes {{on the surface of}} the leaves can absorb nutrients, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> far no enzyme activity has been detected. It may be that this plant also relies on an internal food web for soft tissue digestion. The same could be said for Paepalanthus bromelioides, though it is a member of Eriocaulaceae and not a bromeliad. It also forms a central water reservoir that has adaptations to attract insects. It, like C. berteroniana, produces no digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Feletti faced a court trial {{under the}} code of laws in effect in Bologna {{at the time of}} Edgardo's removal. Carboni {{proposed}} that even under the pontifical laws, the seizure was illegal—he reported that he had seen no evidence to support the friar's claim that he had acted following instructions from Rome, and that there was substantial evidence casting doubt on Morisi's account, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> far as he could see Feletti had done nothing to verify what she had said before ordering the child removed. After Feletti refused to appoint a defence counsel when prompted, saying he was putting his defence in the hands of God and the Virgin Mary, the experienced Bologna lawyer Francesco Jussi was appointed by the state to defend him.|$|E

5|$|It {{is mounted}} on a {{rectangular}} cast-iron column of two-tons weight that rests on the masonry pier. Through a glass door in the column {{you can see the}} driving clock that keeps the telescope turning westward just as fast as the stars go, so that a star remains in view as long as the astronomer wishes to observe it. The telescope turns on two axes {{at the top of the}} column. One axis slants upwards toward the north pole of the heavens; the other at right angles to it, and it is to this one that the tube of the telescope is attached. Two large circles provide graduated scales for locating objects by their coordinates. The instrument can be turned on these axes toward any part of the sky. It is a heavy instrument, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> perfectly balanced that the astronomer moves it easily with one hand.|$|E
5|$|Morchella frustrata fruit bodies grow solitary, scattered, or {{in small}} groups in spring, in mountainous forests and maquis. The exact trophic status of the fungus is not yet known with certainty, but it is {{suspected}} to be fucaltitive mycorrhizal or biotrophic. Tree species associated with the fungus include pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii), oaks (Quercus spp.), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), and white fir (Abies concolor). In Europe it is often found with holm oak (Quercus ilex), strawberry trees (Arbutus andrachne), olive trees (Olea europaea), Spanish fir (Abies pinsapo), Silver fir (Abies alba) and Scot's pine (Pinus sylvestris). Although it was originally hypothesized that collections of M. frustrata from Turkey might have been recently introduced from North America, numerous collections reported since from remote and undisturbed areas in the Mediterranean and the Alps (including Bresadola's original collection from Trentino), suggest a long-time and well-established presence of this species in Europe. Kuo suggests {{that it might be}} also widely distributed in western North America, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> far has only been confirmed to be present in Oregon and California.|$|E
5|$|Not only is {{the park}} historic, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> is the mostly {{residential}} surrounding neighborhood. Many architectural works line the streets facing the park, designed {{by some of the}} most famous architects of the late 19th century, including Henry Hobson Richardson. At least two governors of New York lived in buildings facing Washington Park outside of their term in office. Due to the historical and architectural significance of the park and neighborhood both were included in 1972 as the Washington Park Historic District; and in 1998 the park was named one of the nation's 100 most important parks by the American Association of Architects. In 2008 Boston-based composer Peter Child wrote an orchestral piece inspired by the park, entitled Washington Park.|$|E

5|$|The city of Bastogne, Belgium was a hub {{of several}} major roads {{and became a}} prime target for the Germans, seeing its capture as {{necessary}} to their advance. Middleton was in continuous communication with Bradley at 12th Army Group headquarters in Luxembourg, and maintained that though Bastogne could soon be surrounded, it should be held. As the Germans advanced on Bastogne, both Bradley and First Army commander Hodges recognized the threat to Middleton and had him move his headquarters. He was supposed to leave Bastogne on 18 December, but spent another night there {{so that he could}} brief his relief force, the 101st Airborne Division. Not only did that division's acting commander, Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe, show up ahead of schedule, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> did Colonel William Roberts from the 10th Armored Division Combat Command R (CCR), sent by Patton. Another welcome guest arriving later that evening was Major General Matthew Ridgway, commander of XVIII Airborne Corps, en route to his headquarters, but advised by Middleton to stay in Bastogne for the night to avoid capture by the Germans. While Middleton and his guests slept, elements of the 101st Airborne poured into Bastogne all during the night and into the following day.|$|E
5|$|The family symbol in {{advertising}} may be observable before the industrial revolution, {{but it was}} not until after the industrial revolution that advertising boomed and the use of family images {{in advertising}} became prevalent. The industrial revolution changed advertising from informative flyers marking the availability of goods in 17th and 18th century Europe, whose audience were those within physical propinquity, to multimillion-dollar campaigns that attempted to instantly connect and persuade peoples from across the world. After the industrial revolution, large companies emerged as mass-producers, products became branded, and customers began establishing brand loyalties. Thus, persuading customers to purchase one brand rather than another became vital to advertising. An advertisement was responsible for making products and services salient in order to earn consumer attention in competitive industrial markets. During this period, not only did the immensity of the advertising industry drastically change, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> did its marketing strategies as it began to incorporate images and specify an audience. This change from largely informative to largely persuasive strategies and from general to specific audiences explains the increase in presence and usage of symbols, representations, and stereotypes in advertising—including those of the family.|$|E
