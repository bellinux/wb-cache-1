The neighbors are upset and the family's upset, and would you do something about it. How would you think about that as a problem? Some kind of bizarre behavior like that.|$|E

I am really nervous but now we have started rehearsing, I am feeling equally excited. It will {{definitely}} be an experience and I hope Perry runs smoothly!" [...] She also said she was [...] "terrified" [...] of acting out the birth, saying she would prefer to give birth in real life. She said that filming the pre-recorded labour scenes meant she [...] "was knackered after screaming and crying and pretending to push all day." [...] In an interview with Digital Spy, she said that she was [...] "really, really nervous" [...] and that the prospect of acting the birth was [...] "very scary", but added, [...] "I really appreciate that they've given me the opportunity, especially considering that I haven't been here at EastEnders for that long. It's really nice that they've trusted me with it, so hopefully I'll do it justice! It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it'll go well." [...] To help prepare, she asked several women for advice, including her mother, and was told [...] "It's the worst pain you can ever imagine!" [...] She found it [...] "quite difficult" [...] to imagine what it would be like to act out as she has no children, but had watched Channel 4 show One Born Every Minute to help, as she did not want to [...] "overdo the scene or make it look really fake." ...|$|E

25|$|The Adventist {{views about}} death and hell reflect an {{underlying}} belief in: (a) conditional immortality (or conditionalism), {{as opposed to}} the immortality of the soul; and (b) the holistic (or monistic) Christian anthropology or nature of human beings, as opposed to bipartite or tripartite views.

He concludes with the hypothesis that testosterone is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition {{for the development of the}} institutions he examined. In other words, without testosterone, the institutions would not develop—it must be part (<b>but</b> not <b>all)</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> explanation for their universality.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Most organisms {{depend on}} chemoreception for {{survival}} and reproduction. In Drosophila melanogaster multigene families of chemosensory receptors and putative odorant binding proteins have been identified. Here, we introduce an additional distinct protein, encoded by the CG 4710 gene, {{that contributes to}} olfactory behavior. Previously, we identified through P[lArB]element mutagenesis a smell impaired (smi) mutant, smi 21 F, with odorant-specific defects in avoidance responses. Here, we show that the smi 21 F mutant also exhibits reduced attractant responses to some, <b>but</b> not <b>all,</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> select group <b>of</b> odorants. Furthermore, electroantennogram amplitudes are increased in smi 21 F flies. Charac...|$|R

40|$|Partial {{explanations}} are everywhere. That is, explanations citing causes that explain some <b>but</b> not <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> effect are ubiquitous across science, and these in turn {{rely on the}} notion of degree of explanation. I argue that current accounts are seriously deficient. In particular, they do not incorporate adequately the way in which a cause’s explanatory importance varies with choice of explanandum. Using influential recent contrastive theories, I develop quantitative definitions that remedy this lacuna, and relate it to existing measures of degree of causation. Among other things, this reveals the precise role here of chance, as well as bearing on the relation between causal explanation and causation itself...|$|R
