5|$|The Cuban macaw or Cuban red macaw (Ara tricolor) was {{a species}} of macaw native to the main island of Cuba and the nearby Isla de la Juventud that became extinct in the late 19th century. Its {{relationship}} with other macaws in the genus Ara is uncertain, but it may have <b>been</b> <b>closely</b> related to the scarlet macaw, which has some similarities in appearance. It may also have <b>been</b> <b>closely</b> related, or identical, to the hypothetical Jamaican red macaw. No modern skeletons are known, but a few subfossil remains have been found on Cuba.|$|E
5|$|Development in Canberra has <b>been</b> <b>closely</b> {{regulated}} by government, both through planning processes {{and the use}} of crown lease terms that have tightly limited the use of parcels of land. Land in the ACT is held on 99-year crown leases from the national government, although most leases are now administered by the Territory government. There have been persistent calls for constraints on development to be liberalised.|$|E

50|$|Though {{the family}} {{includes}} three genera of blind, subterranean, and troglobitic catfishes, Trogloglanis, Satan, and Prietella, {{none of these}} three genera <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> related. Instead, Satan <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> related to Pylodictis, Prietella to Noturus, and Trogloglanis possibly to Ictalurus, although it may not <b>be</b> <b>closely</b> related {{to any of the}} other ictalurids. Ameiurus is sister to a clade formed by Satan, Pylodictis, Noturus, and Prietella.|$|R
5|$|Economically, {{the area}} depends on agriculture. Maize, rice, yuca, cotton and heart of palm are {{produced}} and exported. Cattle ranching {{and the industrial}} processing of milk and cheese have been developed extensively in recent years. Crafts, often carved of wood using the same techniques as in colonial times, provide additional income. Since {{the launch of the}} Jesuit Mission Circuit– a marketing label to promote regional tourism– in 2005, craftsmanship and tourism have <b>been</b> <b>closely</b> related.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, the first {{vascular}} plant was found growing on the northern shore of Surtsey, mosses became visible in 1967, and lichens were first found on the Surtsey lava in 1970. Plant colonisation on Surtsey has <b>been</b> <b>closely</b> studied, the vascular plants in particular {{as they have been}} of far greater significance than mosses, lichens and fungi in the development of vegetation.|$|E
5|$|The Pasadena–Baytown area, {{including}} Deer Park and La Porte, {{straddles the}} Houston Ship Channel {{and has since}} the world wars been defined by the heavy industry along its shores. The two towns have distinct histories with Baytown having become tied to the oil industry earlier and Pasadena having a longer history tied to ranching and agriculture before petrochemicals came to dominate. But in modern times their fortunes have <b>been</b> <b>closely</b> tied by their cores of heavy industry.|$|E

5|$|The broad-billed parrot or raven parrot (Lophopsittacus mauritianus) {{is a large}} extinct parrot in {{the family}} Psittaculidae. It was endemic to the Mascarene island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar. It is unclear what other species it is most closely related to, {{but it has been}} {{classified}} {{as a member of the}} tribe Psittaculini, along with other Mascarene parrots. It had similarities with the Rodrigues parrot (Necropsittacus rodricanus), and may have <b>been</b> <b>closely</b> related.|$|E
5|$|The {{current flag}} design {{represents}} {{a dramatic change}} {{in the evolution of the}} Portuguese standard, which had always <b>been</b> <b>closely</b> associated with the royal arms, blue and white. Since the country's foundation, the national flag developed from the bluecross-on-white armorial square banner of King Afonso I to the liberal monarchy's arms over a blue-and-white rectangle. In between, major changes associated with determinant political events contributed to its evolution into the current design.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} {{paleontology}} traces {{the history of}} the effort to understand the history of life on Earth by studying the fossil record left behind by living organisms. Since it is concerned with understanding living organisms of the past paleontology can be considered to be a field of biology, but its historical development has <b>been</b> <b>closely</b> tied to geology and the effort to understand the history of Earth itself.|$|E

5|$|Two {{centuries before}} Mau and the Hōkūle‘a, Captain James Cook, {{with the help}} of Tupaia, gained {{knowledge}} that otherwise would have <b>been</b> <b>closely</b> held. Before his death in 1779, Cook hypothesized that Polynesians shared common ancestry; he even pinned their origin to Asia. However, Cook's theory did not prevent debate among scholars. Before the Hōkūle‘a voyage in 1976, academic debate about the settlement of Polynesia was divided between several schools of thought.|$|E
5|$|As both a New York State Senator and Buffalo Mayor, he has <b>been</b> <b>closely</b> {{involved}} {{in the development of}} the three Seneca Nation casinos that have been planned and built in Western New York since 2002. As someone born and raised downstate who went on to become an upstate political servant, he has been active on the statewide political front. He is a close political ally of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. He has also been active with the National Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition in efforts to prevent gun-related crime. His plan to revitalize Buffalo by demolishing its abundant vacant buildings has drawn opposition from historic preservationists, but he has made the development of the Buffalo waterfront a priority.|$|E

5|$|Echmarcach {{appears to}} have forged an {{alliance}} with the powerful Uí Briain. A leading member of this kindred, Donnchad mac Briain, King of Munster, was married to Cacht ingen Ragnaill, {{a woman who could}} have <b>been</b> <b>closely</b> related to Echmarcach. Certainly, Echmarcach's daughter, Mór, married one of Donnchad's Uí Briain close kinsmen. Echmarcach's violent career brought him into bitter conflict with a particular branch of the Uí Ímair who had held Dublin periodically from the early eleventh century. This branch was supported by the rising Uí Cheinnselaig, an Irish kindred responsible for Echmarcach's final expulsion from Dublin and apparently Mann as well.|$|E
5|$|In baseball, {{the home}} run {{is one of the}} most popular aspects of the game. Thus, the career record for home runs is among the most {{important}} and respected records in baseball. The road to this record has <b>been</b> <b>closely</b> followed and each additional home run Bonds hits extends the current record further. On August 7, 2007, Barry Bonds became the major leagues' career home run champion by hitting his 756th career home run, which surpassed Hank Aaron's total. the ball was caught by Pistolay.|$|E
5|$|The Tahiti rail, Tahitian red-billed rail, or Pacific red-billed rail (Gallirallus pacificus) is an {{extinct species}} of rail that lived on Tahiti. It was first {{recorded}} during James Cook's second voyage {{around the world}} (1772–1775), on which it was illustrated by Georg Forster and described by Johann Reinhold Forster. No specimens have been preserved. As well as the documentation by the Forsters, there have been claims that the bird also existed on the nearby island of Mehetia. The Tahiti rail appears to have <b>been</b> <b>closely</b> related to, and perhaps derived from, the buff-banded rail, and has also been historically confused with the Tongan subspecies of that bird.|$|E

5|$|This {{ordnance}} {{duty was}} {{not new to}} him since he had <b>been</b> <b>closely</b> associated {{with the development of}} small arms marksmanship within the Marine Corps. In 1921, he had been a firing member of the winning Marine Corps Team at the National Matches at Camp Perry, Ohio. In 1927, 1930, and 1931, he served with the rifle and pistol teams as assistant coach. During the regional matches of 1932 and 1933, he acted as team coach and captain, respectively. Upon the resumption of the National Matches in 1935, he was captain of the Marine Corps national rifle and pistol teams of 1935 and 1936, winning the national trophies in both years.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid-18th century, Crompton's textile sector had <b>been</b> <b>closely</b> {{linked with}} that of Rochdale and Saddleworth {{in the north and}} east; it was a woollen {{manufacturing}} district. However, as the demand for cotton goods increased, Crompton mirrored developments in Oldham and Manchester in the south and southwest, importing raw cotton and making cotton cloth. To ensure that the woollen trade was kept buoyant, a law existed from 1675 to 1814 to encourage Shaw and Crompton's wool production. It required that the deceased were to be buried in woollen garments.|$|E
5|$|From a {{husbandry}} {{point of}} view, hyenas are easily kept, {{as they have}} few disease problems {{and it is not}} uncommon for captive hyenas to reach 15–20 years of age. Nevertheless, the spotted hyena was historically scantily represented in zoos, and was typically obtained in order to fill empty cages until a more prestigious species could be obtained. In subsequent years, animals considered to be more charismatic were allocated larger and better quality facilities, while hyenas were often relegated to inferior exhibits. In modern times, the species faces spatial competition from more popular animals, especially large canids. Also, many captive individuals have not <b>been</b> <b>closely</b> examined to confirm their sexes, thus resulting in non-breeding pairs often turning out to be same-sexed individuals. As a result, many captive hyena populations are facing extinction.|$|E
