5|$|In the 1970s, the anti-terrorism {{industry}} offered <b>bullet-proof</b> vehicles, bugging {{devices and}} security hardware. Mardas set up companies offering these products to VIPs, using the former King Constantine II of Greece as his principal salesman. Ex-King Constantine—who {{at the time}} was exiled in Britain—provided contacts to several royal families for Mardas, and had close contact with the deposed Shah of Iran, who had moved to Mexico. The Shah {{was one of the first}} people interested in the customised <b>bullet-proof</b> cars that Mardas was offering, and was believed to have financially assisted Mardas’ companies.|$|E
5|$|The Elections and Transitions Committee {{arranged}} for the Whittemore Center {{to be used for}} the consecration, a large hockey rink {{on the campus of the}} University of New Hampshire in Durham. The numbers expected were about 3,000 people, 300 press, a 200 strong choir, and 48 bishops. The security was strong: just as Barbara Harris had to wear a <b>bullet-proof</b> vest at her consecration, Robinson was showing his <b>bullet-proof</b> vest to Harris herself. Robinson's parents, sister, daughter and their families and his ex-wife Boo were all at the consecration. Robinson was consecrated on November 2, 2003, in the presence of Frank Griswold, Presiding Bishop, and six co-consecrating bishops: 48 bishops in all.|$|E
5|$|As of 2009, monthly {{visits to}} the tomb in <b>bullet-proof</b> {{vehicles}} under heavy IDF protection are organised by the Yitzhar based organization Shechem Ehad. In late April 2009, a group of Jewish worshipers found the headstone smashed and swastikas painted on the walls, as well as boot prints on the grave itself.|$|E

50|$|Manda Bala {{profiles}} such {{subjects as}} a businessman who <b>bullet-proofs</b> his cars, a plastic surgeon who reconstructs the ears of kidnap victims, former Governor and Senator Jáder Barbalho, a powerful Brazilian politician {{from the state of}} Pará who used a frog farm for money laundering, and the owner of the frog farm himself (see SUDAM).|$|R
5000|$|His car rivalled {{those of}} the later James Bond series, [...] "being a rather dull 1935 model" [...] capable of speeds up to 130 mph (unheard of at the time), [...] "bullet-proofed {{throughout}} and equipped with devices and special little inventions for offence and defence," [...] including automatic <b>bullet-proofed</b> windows and [...] "miniature torpedoes of potent knock-out gas." ...|$|R
5|$|As {{the storm}} arrives, Marty {{returns to the}} clock tower and the {{lightning}} strikes on cue, sending Marty back to October 1985. He finds that Doc is not dead, as he had listened to Marty's warnings and worn a <b>bullet-proof</b> vest. Doc takes Marty home, then departs to 2015.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian {{team won}} the tournament {{for the third time}} in 1970, {{allowing}} them to keep the real trophy in perpetuity, as had been stipulated by Jules Rimet in 1930. It was put on display at the Brazilian Football Confederation headquarters in Rio de Janeiro in a cabinet with a front of <b>bullet-proof</b> glass.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the anti-terrorism {{industry}} offered <b>bullet-proof</b> vehicles, bugging {{devices and}} security hardware, so Mardas set up companies offering these products to VIPs. King Hussein of Jordan bought {{a fleet of}} cars that Mardas had customised, but then reportedly had the changes reversed when tests demonstrated them to be useless. In 1987, Mardas was a managing director of Alcom Ltd, which specialised in electronic communications and security. He later returned to Greece.|$|E
50|$|The vehicle has {{the same}} visual {{appearance}} as a regular BMW 7 Series , however it has been subject to extensive modifications. The limousine has been fitted with <b>bullet-proofed</b> doors, windows as well as armour {{on the floor of}} the vehicle. On top of this, the vehicle has a protected fuel tank that does not explode when damaged and can withstand a roadside bomb.|$|R
50|$|The armour {{was much}} {{improved}} {{compared to the}} almost nonexistent protection fitted to the SM.79. It was {{said there was a}} total of 700 kg (1,540 lb) fitted, but it is unclear if this also included the self-sealing fuel tanks, <b>bullet-proofed</b> up to 12.7 mm (.50 in) rounds. One noticeable difference was the twin tail, which gave a better field of fire to the dorsal gun, and helped to cope with the greater power and weight compared to the SM.79.|$|R
50|$|The old Palace was gutted almost entirely, {{not only}} {{to meet the needs}} of the Presidential Family, but also because the {{buildings}} had been weakened by patch up renovations over a century that had resulted in unstable floors and leaking roofs. The building is now made of poured concrete, concrete slabs, steel girders and trusses, all concealed under elegant hardwood floors, panels and ceilings. It is fully <b>bullet-proofed,</b> cooled by central air-conditioning with filters, and has an independent power supply. Architect Jorge Ramos oversaw the reconstruction, which was closely supervised by Mrs. Marcos. The refurbished Palace was inaugurated on May 1, 1979-the Marcos' silver wedding anniversary.|$|R
5|$|Costello {{picks up}} the trenchcoat and shoots more {{subordinates}} who get in his way. Fung is finally the last surviving member, so he attempts to walk nonchalantly by Costello, relying on the Frenchman's inability to recognize him without the coat, but as he is walking by, Costello sees a sticker on Fung's tie. Both men shoot at each other. Fung is hit and Costello demands that he put the coat on, which Fung refuses, so Costello shoots him in the leg. Fung puts the coat on, Costello checks the bullet holes in the coat and sees that they align with the bullets stuck in the <b>bullet-proof</b> vest he was wearing. Costello then stands up and fires a round into Fung's head killing him. Costello is last seen eating and laughing with the woman and children.|$|E
5|$|For testing purposes, a {{new engine}} {{consisting}} of six Armstrong Siddeley Viper jet engines blowing across the outer rim of an impeller was designed {{under the name}} PV-704, PV stood for Private Venture. The PV-704 was a stop-gap design built into a bunker-like building behind the Avro Experimental Test facility. It was intended to test various Project 1794 concepts and provide the USAF with test data to show {{the viability of the}} concept. The original plan to initially test the Viper Engine Rig was to have continued into free flight testing. Unfortunately, testing was anything but smooth; the test model suffered from hazardous oil leaks, resulting in three fires. It eventually got to the point that staff were afraid of the machine, even when safely ensconced in a booth constructed of <b>bullet-proof</b> glass and quarter-inch-thick steel. A final, disastrous and nearly lethal engine test in 1956 which involved a Viper jet engine running wild, convinced Frost that a less dangerous test vehicle was necessary.|$|E
5|$|That night, FBI agents wait at {{the concert}} hall for Barnett's arrival. Barnett, who goes {{completely}} unseen due to his youthful appearance, poses as a piano tuner. He shoots Scully in the chest during the recital and then flees, taking the cellist hostage. Mulder doesn't hesitate this time around and fires at Barnett, fatally wounding him. Scully is revealed to have survived the attack, having worn a <b>bullet-proof</b> vest. Despite the efforts of doctors and a mysterious CIA agent to resuscitate Barnett, he dies, and takes the secrets of Ridley's research to the grave. The episode ends with the camera zooming in on locker number 935 in a train station, implying the secrets along with Barnett's precaution, a bomb, are contained within and one day will be discovered.|$|E
50|$|Before {{production}} began of the of Hongqi, Chinese leaders used various foreign luxury cars. For example, Chairman Mao Zedong used a <b>bullet-proofed</b> ZIL-115 {{donated by}} Stalin, while Premier Zhou Enlai used a GAZ-12 ZIM, later a ZIL-115 and Foreign Minister Chen Yi used a Mercedes-Benz 600 Pullman before Hongqi began production of its CA770. Since the 1960s Chinese leaders have traditionally used limousines produced under the Hongqi brand for official events. Before the new Hongqi HQE (official name L9) was introduced, the Chinese leaders used special version of CA770 limousine {{to review the}} troops on National Days. During former leader Hu Jintao's review of troops on National Day in 2009, he was seen in a Hongqi HQE Limousine. The HQE is powered by an aluminium V12 cylinder engine of Chinese design (designation CA12VG), with a displacement of 6.0 liters and producing 370 kW (470 hp) at 5600 rpm and 550 N m (405 lb·ft) of torque at 4400 rpm. It is bulletproof, completely hand built and comes with run flat tyres.When the Kuomintang was still in power, Provisional President Sun Yatsen used a Ford Model T and his successor Chiang Kaishek used an armoured Packard limousine in China and a Cadillac 75 armoured limo in Taiwan.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{tracks the}} operations of Hassan Jalloh, once a commander in Sierra Leone's devastating civil war, now self-proclaimed "King of West Africa Mystical Power and Culture. " Jalloh served in the Civil Defense Forces, a pro-government militia that mobilized the imagery and practices of village hunter traditions in pursuit of local legitimacy and esoteric defense maneuvers including disappearance, metamorphosis, and <b>bullet-proofing.</b> Faced with disarmament and doubtful reintegration {{at the end of}} the decade-long war, Jalloh turned to Allah for guidance, then redeployed his troops as the touring Warrior Cultural and Mystical Power Dance Troupe. Through the virtuosic fusion of acts that might variously appear as fearsome masked dancing, military pageantry, bloody self-mutilation, and sleight-of-hand hocus-pocus, Jalloh publicly demonstrates the abilities he acquired in wartime and expounds on themes ranging from Islamic doctrine and cultural reconstruction to nationalism and HIV/AIDS prevention. Building from more than eighteen months of research employing participant observation, oral histories, archival records, and critical videography, I follow Hassan Jalloh's Warriors and other troupes as they travel throughout the Mende regions of Sierra Leone and across numerous sites at which spectacle is used to manifest, marshal, and mitigate violence. I use Jalloh's program of acts as a thematic link between performances of militias, herbalists, subcultures, and initiatory societies, bringing their shared logics and aesthetics into focus. Each case exemplifies how Sierra Leonean individuals and institutions currently exploit public spectacle to navigate and influence unstable transitions between physical violence of open conflict, memories of violence, and the structural violence of consolidations of political power. Rather than unidirectional transmission from the spectated to the spectator, these performances hinge on a living interface, a relationship summed up in Jalloh's onstage axiom, "I am seeing you seeing me. " Spectacles in Sierra Leone are events at which extraordinary visuality conjures crowds for many ends: to judge, to heal, to educate, to manifest invisible forces, and-most importantly in the postwar context-to effect personal and social transformations...|$|R

25|$|At about 10:30a.m. EDT, Jiverly Wong barricaded {{the rear}} door of the Binghamton American Civic Association {{building}} with a vehicle registered in his father's name. He was described as wearing a <b>bullet-proof</b> vest, a bright green nylon jacket, and dark-rimmed glasses.|$|E
25|$|The first soft {{ballistic}} vest, Myunjebaegab, {{was invented}} in Joseon Korea in the 1860s shortly after the French campaign against Korea (1866). Heungseon Daewongun ordered development of <b>bullet-proof</b> armor because of increasing threats from Western armies. Kim Gi-du and Gang Yun found that cotton could protect against bullets if thick enough, and devised <b>bullet-proof</b> vests made of 30 layers of cotton. The vests were used in battle during the United States expedition to Korea (1871), when the US Navy attacked Ganghwa Island in 1871. The US Army captured one of the vests {{and took it to}} the US, where it was stored at the Smithsonian Museum until 2007. The vest has since been sent back to Korea and is currently on display to the public.|$|E
25|$|The company {{produced}} two <b>bullet-proof</b> training villages {{for use by}} the U.S. Army in 2005, a contract worth $3 million. U.S Congressman, Chris Cannon, participated in a demonstration of a similar facility created for use by Utah County police departments, including those from Provo, Brigham Young University, and Orem.|$|E
25|$|The tensile {{strength}} of spider silk {{is greater than}} the same weight of steel and has much greater elasticity.

The exhibition was visited by almost a {{million people in the}} first year. Since that time there has never been any attempted vandalism or other security threat to the painting.|$|E
25|$|With the Israeli {{invasion}} of Lebanon in 1982 the group {{lost much of}} its organization and support. Sympathetic Palestinian organizations including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) withdrew their support and passed materials to the French intelligence services in 1983, detailing ASALA operatives. The last attack, on 19 December 1991, targeted the <b>bullet-proof</b> limousine carrying the Turkish Ambassador to Budapest. The ambassador was not injured in the attack, which was claimed by ASALA in Paris.|$|E
25|$|The FBI {{set up a}} sting {{operation}} to catch the Harrison gang again. A well-known IRA East Tyrone man on the run for killing British forces on the European Continent walks into their traps and attempts to buy Redeye SAMs, M-60 MGs, M-16 rifles, MP5 SMGs and a 11 Level III <b>bullet-proof</b> vests. He later goes on the run, returning to Europe before being captured in 1989 and deported to the US.|$|E
25|$|García Ábrego's {{arrest was}} even subject to {{allegations}} of corruption. It is believed the Mexican government knew all García Ábrego's whereabouts all along and {{had refused to}} arrest him due to information he possessed {{about the extent of}} corruption within the government. The arresting officer, a FJP commander, is believed to have received a <b>bullet-proof</b> Mercury Grand Marquis and $500,000 USD from a rival cartel for enacting the arrest of García Ábrego.|$|E
25|$|Mohamed Ballout, a {{journalist}} with dual French and Lebanese nationality {{working for the}} BBC, was injured in Bani Walid on 16 September when a round fired by a pro-Gaddafi sniper killed one man, passed through the body of another man, and hit Mohammed under the arm, in a gap in his <b>bullet-proof</b> vest. Shrapnel from an exploding shell seriously injured the French freelance photographer Olivier Sarbil in the face, arms and legs during fighting between pro- and anti-Gaddafi forces on 17 September in Sirte.|$|E
25|$|The {{week before}} she arrived on campus, her mother {{published}} {{an open letter}} in her syndicated column asking journalists to leave her daughter alone. Chelsea arrived at Stanford in a motorcade with her parents, Secret Service agents, and almost 250 journalists. For her security, <b>bullet-proof</b> glass was installed in her dorm windows and surveillance cameras were placed in hallways. Secret Service agents in plain clothes lived in her dorm. With the exception of an occasional tabloid story written about her, Chelsea's four years at Stanford remained out of public view.|$|E
25|$|RWB also {{provides}} assistance for journalists and media who are either in danger or are having difficulty subsisting. They provide money to assist exiled or imprisoned journalists {{and their families}} and the unsupported families of journalists who have been killed; to enable journalists to leave their home countries if they are in danger there; to repair the effects of vandalism on media outlets; to cover the legal fees of journalists who have been prosecuted for their writings or the medical bills of those who have been physically attacked; and upon occasion, to provide <b>bullet-proof</b> vests for use by journalists.|$|E
25|$|The Bf 109 G-series was {{developed}} from the largely identical F-series airframe, although there were detail differences. Modifications included a reinforced wing structure, an internal <b>bullet-proof</b> windscreen, the use of heavier, welded framing for the cockpit transparencies, and additional light-alloy armour for the fuel tank. It was originally intended that the wheel wells would incorporate small doors to cover the outer portion of the wheels when retracted. To incorporate these the outer wheel bays were squared off. Two small inlet scoops for additional cooling of the spark plugs were added {{on both sides of}} the forward engine cowlings. A less obvious difference was the omission of the boundary layer bypass outlets, which had been a feature of the F-series, on the upper radiator flaps.|$|E
25|$|The two RUC {{officers}} were travelling without escort in Buchanan's personal unmarked car: a red Vauxhall Cavalier with {{the registration number}} KIB 1204 which was not armoured-plated and didn't have <b>bullet-proof</b> glass. Buchanan had used this same car on all of his previous visits to Dundalk and other locations in the Republic of Ireland. Both {{officers were}} unarmed, as it was illegal to transport weapons into the Republic of Ireland, {{and they were in}} plain clothes. Buchanan drove away from the Dundalk Garda station after the meeting had ended at about 3.15 p.m. and turned off the main Dublin-Belfast road onto the Edenappa Road which is a minor rural road which passes through the village of Jonesborough. Buchanan was known by the British Army to regularly take this route when going to or from Dundalk Garda station.|$|E
25|$|One {{year after}} {{elections}}, on 11 May 2014, Khan alleged that 2013 general elections were rigged {{in favour of}} the ruling Pakistan Muslim Leaque. On 14 August 2014, Imran Khan led a rally of supporters from Lahore to Islamabad, promising Nawaz Sharif's resignation and investigation into alleged electoral fraud. On {{its way to the}} capital Khan's convoy was attacked by stones from Muslim League supporters in Gujranwala; however, there were no fatalities. Khan was reported to be attacked with guns which forced him to travel him in <b>bullet-proof</b> vehicle. On 15 August Khan led protesters entered the capital and a few days later marched into the high-security Red Zone; on 1 September 2014, according to Al Jazeera, attempted to storm Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's official residence, which prompted the outbreak of violence which has resulted in three deaths and more than 595 people injured, including 115 police officers.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1984, The Black Onyx, {{developed}} by <b>Bullet-Proof</b> Software, led by Henk Rogers, {{was released on}} the PC-8801 in Japan. It {{became one of the}} best-selling computer games at the time and was voted Game of the Year by Login, the largest Japanese computer game magazine at the time. The game is thus credited for bringing wider attention to computer role-playing games in the country. In early 1984, Mugen no Shinzou (Heart of Fantasy) featured a large open world. The cyberpunk RPG Psychic City, released by HOT・B for the FM-7 and PC-8801 in 1984, departed from the fantasy theme common in other RPGs at the time (such as Hydlide and The Black Onyx) in favour of a science fiction plot, set in a post-apocalyptic city devastated by World War III and where the protagonist fights using psychic/telepathic abilities. The game later served {{as the basis for the}} 1987 NES RPG Hoshi wo Miru Hito.|$|E
25|$|It was {{suspected}} that the Model Z's crash during a speed run in December 1931 was due to an unexpected failure of the gasoline tank cap, which may have come loose and passed through the windshield. A <b>bullet-proof</b> windscreen and internal fuel caps {{were part of the}} new design. Analysis of motion picture film of the event examined frame-by-frame, is inconclusive. Control surface flutter is a more likely cause. It is theorized that the gas cap struck the pilot and incapacitated him, causing a sudden upset in pitch that led to uncontrolled flutter in the right aileron which imparted undue stress on that wing, causing it to pitch up sharply and fail. In addition, tests of a reproduction aircraft have shown that the Gee Bee Z was susceptible to aerodynamic flutter at high speed. The 1932 R-1 and its sister ship, the R-2, were the successors of the previous year's Thompson Trophy-winning Model Z.|$|E
