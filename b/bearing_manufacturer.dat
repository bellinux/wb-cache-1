50|$|Stripped of its needle business, Torrington {{entered the}} 1980s as {{primarily}} a <b>bearing</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> with needle bearings accounting for 49 {{percent of the}} company's sales and heavy bearings contributing another 30 percent. After several years of corporate restructuring, Torrington became a considerably larger <b>bearing</b> <b>manufacturer</b> when the company acquired Fafnir Bearing Company in 1985. Formed, like Torrington, in Connecticut, Fafnir had evolved into a leading bearing producer from its origination in 1911, becoming by the mid-1980s a precision ball <b>bearing</b> <b>manufacturer</b> serving the aerospace, machine tool, industrial, and agricultural industries with distinction. When the two bearing producers were combined in 1985, adding Fafnir's seven manufacturing facilities to Torrington's already numerous manufacturing facilities, {{the result was the}} largest bearing manufacturing company in North America and {{one of the largest in}} the world, with total sales amounting to roughly $750 million.|$|E

50|$|In 1977 however, NTN Toyo {{posted a}} loss of 1 billion JPY due to the {{increasing}} value of the Japanese Yen making exports more expensive. Because most of their bearings were still made inside the borders of Japan, the prices of the bearings were still subject to changes in international exchange rates. Additionally, many Japanese <b>bearing</b> <b>manufacturers</b> were penalized by the European Economic Community for predatory pricing. As a result, in 1978, {{for the first time}} in over a decade, NTN Toyo withheld dividend payments.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the decade, Toyo {{created a}} {{marketing}} division called NTN Sales, at the same time, becoming one of the five most prominent <b>bearing</b> <b>manufacturers</b> in Japan, alongside Koyo Seiko, Nippon Seiko, Asahi Seiko and Fujikoshi Kozai. They, along with the other four aforementioned companies held over 75% of that country's bearing market the following year. Three years later, in 1954, NTN Sales received the Deming Prize for statistical quality control while continuing to diversify its product offering. In 1956, the company started to manufacture expansion compensating bearings.|$|R
50|$|With {{conventional}} single nozzle air bearings, {{the compressed}} air flows {{through a few}} relatively large nozzles (diameter 0.1 - 0.5 mm) into the bearing gap. The air consumption thus allows only some flexibility such that the bearing’s features (force, moments, bearing surface, bearing gap height, damping) can be adjusted only insufficiently. However, {{in order to allow}} a uniform air pressure even with only some nozzles, air <b>bearing</b> <b>manufacturers</b> take constructive techniques. In doing so, these air bearings cause dead volumes (non-compressible and thus weak air volume). In effect, this dead volume is very harmful for the air bearing’s dynamic and causes self-excited vibrations.|$|R

50|$|The {{following}} year, the company's {{name was}} changed from Toyo Bearing Manufacturing to NTN Toyo Bearing Company. Like other Japanese <b>bearing</b> <b>manufacturers,</b> NTN became {{so successful that}} it created angst among their overseas competitors, {{especially those in the}} United Kingdom. England in fact, urged Japanese companies to restrict exports from 1972-1974. Other countries in Europe, however, were quite adamant about procuring such superior quality bearings, and continued to do so. For this reason, the company's growth was uninterrupted during the mid-1970s. In fact, from 1973-1975, NTN Manufacturing Canada, NTN de Mexico and NTN Suramericana were opened, in addition to another factory in Elgin, Illinois.|$|R

40|$|LecturePredicting the {{performance}} of directly lubricated bearings is a challenge facing <b>bearing</b> <b>manufacturers</b> and end users alike. In this study, thermoelastohydrodynamic (TEHD) theories are applied to analyze three directly lubricated bearings that have been experimentally investigated by the Turbomachinery Laboratory at Texas A&M University, including two inlet groove bearings and one spray bar bearing. The main aspects of the TEHD models are presented, including an extensive discussion on groove mixing. Comparisons are made between the theoretical and experimental results for the pad temperatures and shaft centerline locations. The results, which show generally good agreement, indicate that the TEHD theories are capable of predicting the steady state performance of these directly lubricated bearings with reasonable accuracy. Limitations of the simple groove mixing model and the elastic model were also identified...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a reliability analysis model of wind turbine gearboxes {{by developing a}} generic gearbox configuration and modular structure. It encapsulates all the reliability critical components within the gearbox subsystem in a wind turbine. Reliability block diagrams of gearbox modules and components have been established by using Relex Reliability Analysis software. Failure rates of the critical components are estimated by applying existing industrial standards and datasheets for general mechanical applications. Results of failure rates and reliability of three generic gearbox configurations have been obtained. To improve the reliability prediction of wind turbine gearbox, an advanced prediction model based on failure modes and load carrying capability of individual components under operational conditions has been discussed. This research has highlighted the importance of validation of the reliability prediction models using available field failure data, which could be only possible through collaborations of wind farm owners, WT manufacturers, gearbox <b>manufacturers,</b> and <b>bearing</b> <b>manufacturers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Ceramic/ceramic and ceramic/steel {{contacts}} under lubricated rolling {{conditions are}} studied. This work {{is of interest}} to ball <b>bearing</b> <b>manufacturers</b> {{as the use of}} ceramics in the design of these components has some advantages over traditional bearing-steel materials. Low density and increased stiffness are the mechanical properties which gas-turbine and machine tool manufacturers are most likely to realise. Much research {{over the past two decades}} on material structure, quality control and manufacturing techniques has produced a material which can seriously challenge bearing steel in ball-bearing design. This is especially the case for hybrid ball-bearings, ie ceramic balls with steel bearing races which are now used as standard components. The purpose of this study is to examine the rolling contact fatigue failure modes of ceramics. This study concentrates on silicon nitride as this material has most potential for use by industry. The primary reason for studying ceramic balls is because of interest in ball-bearing applications, hence a modified four-ball machine is employed which correctly models ball motions and precisely defines bal...|$|R
