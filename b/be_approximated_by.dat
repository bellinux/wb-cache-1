5|$|Satellite {{measurements}} made in 1999 {{with the}} Wide Field Infrared Explorer {{showed that the}} brightness of Altair fluctuates slightly, varying by just a few thousandths of a magnitude with several different periods less than 2 hours. As a result, it was identified in 2005 as a Delta Scuti variable star. Its light curve can <b>be</b> <b>approximated</b> <b>by</b> adding together a number of sine waves, with periods that range between 0.8 and 1.5 hours. It is a weak source of coronal X-ray emission, with the most active sources of emission being located near the star's equator. This activity {{may be due to}} convection cells forming at the cooler equator.|$|E
5|$|The mass, radius and {{luminosity}} {{of a star}} {{are closely}} interlinked, and their respective values can <b>be</b> <b>approximated</b> <b>by</b> three relations. First is the Stefan–Boltzmann law, which relates the luminosity L, the radius R and the surface temperature Teff. Second is the mass–luminosity relation, which relates the luminosity L and the mass M. Finally, the relationship between M and R is close to linear. The ratio of M to R increases {{by a factor of}} only three over 2.5 orders of magnitude of M. This relation is roughly proportional to the star's inner temperature TI, and its extremely slow increase reflects the fact that the rate of energy generation in the core strongly depends on this temperature, whereas it has to fit the mass–luminosity relation. Thus, a too high or too low temperature will result in stellar instability.|$|E

25|$|Starting {{from the}} Ising model and repeating this {{iteration}} eventually changes all the couplings. When {{the temperature is}} higher than the critical temperature, the couplings will converge to zero, since the spins at large distances are uncorrelated.

25|$|However, while {{a smooth}} {{manifold}} {{is not a}} PL manifold, it carries a canonical PL structure – it is uniquely triangularizable; conversely, not every PL manifold is smoothable. For a particular smooth manifold or smooth map between smooth manifolds, this can be shown by breaking up the manifold into small enough pieces, and then linearizing the manifold or map on each piece: for example, a circle in the plane can <b>be</b> <b>approximated</b> <b>by</b> a triangle, but not by a 2-gon, since this latter cannot be linearly embedded.|$|E

Although only the solutions with one or few instantons (or anti-instantons) are known exactly, a dilute gas of instantons and anti-instantons can <b>be</b> <b>approximated</b> <b>by</b> considering a superposition of one-instanton solutions at great distances from one another. 'tHooft calculated the effective action for such an ensemble, and he found an infrared divergence for big instantons, meaning that an infinite amount of infinitely big instantons would populate the vacuum.|$|E
25|$|It is {{probably}} impossible to completely eliminate dimensional change in wood, but elimination {{of change in}} size may <b>be</b> <b>approximated</b> <b>by</b> chemical modification. For example, wood can be treated with chemicals to replace the hydroxyl groups with other hydrophobic functional groups of modifying agents (Stamm, 1964). Among all the existing processes, wood modification with acetic anhydride has been noted for the high anti-shrink or anti-swell efficiency (ASE) attainable without damage to wood. However, acetylation of wood {{has been slow to}} be commercialised due to the cost, corrosion and the entrapment of the acetic acid in wood. There is an extensive volume of literature relating to the chemical modification of wood (Rowell, 1983, 1991; Kumar, 1994; Haque, 1997).|$|E
25|$|Reflections can {{be divided}} into two types: {{specular}} reflection and diffuse reflection. Specular reflection describes the gloss of surfaces such as mirrors, which reflect light in a simple, predictable way. This allows for production of reflected images that can be associated with an actual (real) or extrapolated (virtual) location in space. Diffuse reflection describes non-glossy materials, such as paper or rock. The reflections from these surfaces can only be described statistically, with the exact distribution of the reflected light depending on the microscopic structure of the material. Many diffuse reflectors are described or can <b>be</b> <b>approximated</b> <b>by</b> Lambert's cosine law, which describes surfaces that have equal luminance when viewed from any angle. Glossy surfaces can give both specular and diffuse reflection.|$|E
