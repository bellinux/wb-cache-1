40|$|Cable arch stayed bridges are {{one type}} of tensile structures, and there are {{increasingly}} such structures constructed. Their performance relies on how they are designed. This type of structures can suffer big deflections under load, in this situation the displacements {{may need to be}} reduced. Sometimes, {{it may be necessary to}} control internal force of a specific cable so the cable force remains within the desired limit. More study need to be done to develop the techniques that are available for such adjustments. This paper deals with theoretical and experimental adjusting of two physical models, and the linear and nonlinear geometrical behavior of cable (arch) stayed bridges. It was concluded that the techniques of adjustment were practical and efficient to reduce, eliminate shape distortion, and control internal <b>bar</b> <b>force</b> of both structures. For structures that behave linearly, it is easier to get the target (displacement or force), but for non-linear structures one iteration of adjustments was not enough to get the displacement target. Through the techniques of the internal <b>bar</b> <b>force</b> adjustment, the amount of force can be reduced even to the zero, e. g. in case of replacing damaged members...|$|E
40|$|Field {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on the new glued laminated timber (glulam) tied arch bridge “Hyakume-ishi ” located on a forest roadway in Akita, Japan. Results showed that the <b>bar</b> <b>force</b> loss already reached almost the maximum 60 % level within less than a year. One reason {{is the use of}} a water-borne preservative for the preliminary pressure treatment of the glulam members. There were large variations in the humidity within 24 -hr spans which resulted to corresponding changes in the <b>bar</b> <b>force.</b> The maximum deflection under the test truck positioned longitudinally at the center of each span in the downstream lane was 8. 4 mm (L/ 2400) on the downstream side tie member which is smaller than L/ 500, the maximum allowable deflection for steel bridges. The deflections are greater when the truck is positioned at the downstream side than those when the truck is positioned at the longitudinal centerline. There is a good agreement between measured and the estimated values using FEM. The maximum deflection under the test truck positioned longitudinally at the center of each span in the downstream lane was 2. 72 mm which is equal to 1 / 1. 56 of the design deflection value of the deck...|$|E
40|$|A {{direct method}} for {{controlling}} nodal displacements and/or internal bar forces {{has been developed}} for prestressable structural assemblies including complex elements (“macro-elements”, e. g. the pantographic element), involving Matrix Condensation. The method is aimed at static shape control of geometrically sensitive structures. The dissertation discusses identification {{of the most effective}} bars for actuation, without incurring violation in bar forces, and also with objective of minimal number of actuators or minimum actuation. The method can also be used for adjustment of bar forces to either reduce instances of high forces or increase low forces (e. g. in a cable nearing slack). The techniques of controlling nodal displacement, <b>bar</b> <b>force</b> and simultaneously nodal displacement and <b>bar</b> <b>force</b> for a structure made of non-complex elements have been verified by experiments on the physical model of a cable-stayed bridge. Likewise the technique of joint displacement controlling of structures constructed from complex structural elements, has been also been confirmed by experiments on the physical model of an aerofoil shaped morphing pantographic structure. Overall, experimental results agree well with theoretical prediction. This dissertation also concerns with morphing structures, e. g. as applied in the aerospace industry. A morphing aerofoil structure capable of variable geometry was developed, which was shown to be able to cater for the different aerodynamic requirements at different stages of flight. In this thesis, two suitable morphing aerofoil structures were made of curved pantographic units. Results show that the configuration with a large number of small pantograph elements exhibits a wider range of Lift Coefficient (CL) and Drag Coefficient (CD) than achievable by the first, and also by the standard NACA 2415 aerofoil with flaps. In addition, {{it was found that the}} morphing aerofoil can decrease the drag by more than 18...|$|E

40|$|There are {{applications}} of structural engineering where tolerances of structural shape and internal forces, under changing service conditions, {{are not only}} important but actually impinge on the structure's serviceability limit state. Such structures could be supporting sensitive and demanding scientific or communications equipment. These structures are typically pin-jointed assemblies, since length actuations can be more readily incorporated {{to bring about the}} shape and/or <b>bar</b> <b>force</b> changes. A direct method for controlling nodal displacements, internal bar forces, and simultaneously both nodal displacements and internal bar forces, of a prestressable pin-jointed assembly under load, is presented in this paper. The method is based on the force method of structural analysis, and revolves around the solution to a matrix equation of the form: d=Yeo+dP, where Y is a lengthy but straightforward expression involving the compatibility and flexibility matrices, and the states of selfstress, dP is the vector of nodal displacements of the structure due only to the load, and d is the desired resultant nodal displacements which can be obtained when elongation actuation eo is applied. The problem then is typically that of looking for a suitable eo to apply that takes the structural displacement from dP to d in {{at least some of the}} components, without incurring additional <b>bar</b> <b>force</b> violations. The paper discusses the method to identify which are the most effective bars for actuation (i. e. what should eo be) so that the desired structural shape can be obtained, without incurring violation in bar forces, through both a minimal number of actuators and minimum actuation in those actuators. The method can also be used for adjustment of bar forces to either reduce instances of high forces or increase low forces, for example in a cable nearing slack...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. According to revised Cailikefu’s rolling {{shear force}} formula, motion path {{equation}} of spatial seven-bar path is built, and mechanical model, with such new structural features as asymmetric and negative offset, is thus successfully established for 2800 mm heavy shear of some Iron&Steel Company. Shear force and <b>bar</b> <b>force</b> of steel plate, {{before and after}} adoption of asymmetric and negative offset structure, are analyzed, as well as horizontal force component of mechanism that influences pure rolling shear and back-wall push force that keeps blade clearance. The discovery is that back-wall push force could be kept large enough at rolling start-up (i. e. {{the time that the}} maximum rolling shear produces), meanwhile, back-wall push force is the most approximate to side forces with adoption of 60 mm~ 100 mm offset. Theoretical results and on-site shear quality both indicate that new structural features such as asymmetric and negative offset {{plays an important role in}} ensuring pure rolling shear and keeping blade clearance constant, which provide an effective means to improve quality of steel plate...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the thermodynamics of stress-laminated bridges under laboratory conditions. After assembling three timber laminated bridge deck panels of 120 " x 43 " x 12 ", high tension rods {{were used to}} form "stress-laminated" panels. Researchers placed the panels in a laboratory freezer, with cold temperature settings of 10 *, 0 *, - 10 *, - 20 °, and - 300 Fahrenheit and repeated the process three times, each with the wood at a different moisture content [...] a "green" moisture content greater than 30 percent, a 17 percent moisture content, and a 7 percent moisture content (mc). The {{results showed that the}} <b>bar</b> <b>force</b> reduction in the green moisture content sample was significantly greater than in either the 17 percent or 7 percent me tests. The study concluded that the moisture content levels and temperature fluctuations cause variations in rod stressing levels; that the tensioning losses occur within a few hours of the temperature drop; that the green moisture content levels have a severe adverse effect on the stressing levels; and that tensioning levels somewhat stabilize with moisture contents below 17 percent. Based on this study, it would appear that any existing stressed bridge decks should be closely monitored until the moisture content of the members is less than 19 percent. Further study may be needed to determine the behavior of bridge decks with a moisture content above 17 percent and below the fiber saturation point. Minnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{formulation}} of the governing equations for an ideal truss described in Chapter 6 involved three steps: 1. The elongation of a bar {{was related to the}} translations of the joints {{at the end of the}} bar. 2. Next, the <b>bar</b> <b>force</b> was expressed in terms of the elongation and then in terms of the joint translations. 3. Finally, the equilibrium conditions for the joints were enforced, resulting in equations relating the external joint loads and internal bar forces. The system equations were obtained by generalizing the member forcedisplacement and joint force equilibrium equations and required defining only two additional transformation matrices (,,.). Later, in Chapter 10, we shall follow essentially the same approach to establish the governing equations for an elastic solid. In this chapter, we develop two variational principles and illustrate their application to an ideal truss. The principle of virtual displacements is treated first. This principle is just an alternate statement of force equilibrium. Next, we discuss the principle of virtual forces and show that it is basically a geometrical compatibility relation. Both principles are then identified as the stationary requirements for certain functions. For this step, we utilize the material presented in Chapter 3, which treats relative extremas of a function. Finally, we discuss the question of stability of an elastic system and develop the stability criterion for an ideal truss. Why bother with variational principles when the derivation of the governing equations for an ideal truss is straightforward? Our objective in discussing them at this time is primarily to expose the reader to this point of view. Also, we can illustrate these principles quite easily with the truss. Later, we shal...|$|E
30|$|Initial {{forces or}} impact pulse applied on bars will {{obviously}} affect the final state {{at end of}} time duration and the speed of dynamic evolution process. The induced higher accelerations on nodes will cause the nodes to oscillate at higher amplitudes. Therefore, the intermediate state will be missed in the time history records. In the present example, the initial <b>bar</b> <b>forces</b> (pre-compressions) are obtained from a spherical geodesic dome (as original bar lengths). If this radium of the geodesic dome is chosen with a large difference between the target ellipsoid semi-principal axes, then the initial <b>bar</b> <b>forces</b> and the forces calculated during dynamic relaxation will be higher and induce time states with lower resolution. Thus, the initial geometry is suggested to be as closer to the target as possible.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{evidence}} for the superiority of two-implant overdentures over complete dentures in the mandible. Various anchorage devices were used to provide stability to overdentures. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare two designs of a rigid bar connecting two mandibular implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Completely edentulous patients received a new denture in the maxilla and an implant-supported overdenture in the mandible. They were randomly allocated to two groups (A or B) with regard to the bar design. A standard U-shaped bar (Dolder bar) was used connecting the two implants in a straight line. For comparison, precision attachments were soldered distal to the bar copings. Group A started the study with the standard bar (S-bar), while group B started with the attachment-bar (A-bar). After 3 months, they had to answer a questionnaire (visual analogue scale [VAS]); then the bar design was changed in both groups. After a period of another 3 months, the patients had to answer the same questions; then they had the choice to keep their preferred bar. Now the study period was extended to another year of observation, and the patients answered again the same questionnaire. In vivo force measurements were carried out with both bar types at the end of the test periods. The prosthetic maintenance service carried out during the 6 -month period was recorded for both bar types in both groups. Statistical analysis as performed with the SPSS statistical package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). RESULTS: Satisfaction was high in both groups. Group B, who had entered the study with the attachment bar, gave slightly better ratings to this type for four items, while in group A, no differences were found. At the end of the 6 -month comparison period, all but one patient wished to continue to wear the attachment bar. Prosthetic service was equal in groups A and B, but the total number of interventions is significantly higher in the attachment <b>bar.</b> <b>Force</b> patterns of maximum biting were similar in both bar designs, but exhibited significantly higher axial forces in the attachment bar. CONCLUSIONS: Both bar designs provide good retention and functional comfort. High stability appears to be an important factor for the patients' satisfaction and oral comfort.

40|$|In {{the wood}} thick-slicing process, the {{compressive}} force {{acting on the}} pressure bar face and the compressive deflections caused in wood play important roles, but few studies {{have dealt with the}} exact measurements of the deflections, and so, the main objective {{of this paper is to}} obtain several basic information on them. The clear specimens the end grain surface to which were applied thin sensitive films printed grid patterns, were prepared. After being soused in water up to saturated condition, they were set on the experimental apparatus equipped with two 2 -axis dynamometers (Fig. 1). Then, these test specimens were compressed or rolled out by two types of pressure bars in both stationary and feeding state of the feeding carriage. The distributions of the deflections in the specimens were determined from the moiré fringe pattern or the distortion pattern of grid line. Furthermore, in order to determine the effects of pressure bar compression and restraint in the thick-slicing process, cutting tests were carried out on the experimental apparatus, using a roller bar and a single faced nosebar (sharp bar), and the cutting force components acting on the tool face and the compressive force components acting on the pressure bar face were measured with the two 2 -axis dynanometers. The main results obtained are summarized as follows: (1) The vertical component of the compressive force acting on the bar face (Pv) varies largely with the combinations of horizontal distance (h) and vertical distance (v), whereas the horizontal component of the <b>bar</b> <b>force</b> (PH) varies slightly with h and v (Figs. 11 and 12). (2) In slicing with a roller bar, Pv increases largely with decrease in h. Therefore, the tool edge deflection due to overcompression of bar occurs in the smaller range of h (Fig. 10). (3) The distribution pattern of the deflection in the workpiece varies with the types of pressure bars applied, that is, in the case of sharp bar, the high strain concentrates at the loaded point and the distribution of the deflection is limited to a narrower area, but in the case of roller bar, the strain concentration diminishes and the distribution of the deflection spreads in a large area (Photos. 1 ～ 4). (4) Surfaces of the sliced veneer produced with a roller bar are well smoother than those with a sharp bar (Photos. 5 and 6). (5) From these results, it may be concluded that the major factors affecting the quality of the thick-sliced veneer are not only the bar restraint which is determined by the combinations of such factors as h, v, depth of cut (t), cutting angle (θ) and roller diameter of roller bar (D) but also the contact area between the bar face and the workpiece surface...|$|E
