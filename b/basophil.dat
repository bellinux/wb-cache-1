25|$|In June 1988, {{after nearly}} a year of guided {{scrutiny}} from its editors, Nature published a controversial and seemingly anomalous paper detailing Dr. Jacques Benveniste and his team's work studying human <b>basophil</b> degranulation {{in the presence of}} extremely dilute antibody serum. In short, their paper concluded that less than a single molecule of antibody could trigger an immune response in human basophils, defying the physical law of mass action. The paper excited substantial media attention in Paris, chiefly because their research sought funding from homeopathic medicine companies. Public inquiry prompted Nature to mandate an extensive, stringent and scientifically questionable experimental replication in Benveniste's lab, through which his team's results were categorically disputed.|$|E

However, recent advances in analytical tools for <b>basophils</b> have clarified the non-redundant roles of <b>basophils</b> in allergic inflammation. <b>Basophils</b> play crucial roles in both IgE-dependent and -independent allergic inflammation, through their migration {{to the site of}} inflammation and secretion of various mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, and proteases. <b>Basophils</b> are known to produce large amounts of IL- 4 in response to various stimuli. Basophil-derived IL- 4 has recently been shown to play versatile roles in allergic inflammation by acting on various cell types, including macrophages, innate lymphoid cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells.

40|$|BACKGROUND In {{contrast}} to eosinophils and neutrophils, {{the regulation of}} the lifespan of human <b>basophils</b> is poorly defined, {{with the exception of}} the potent anti-apoptotic effect of IL- 3 that also promotes pro-inflammatory effector functions and phenotypic changes. Type I IFNs (IFN-α, IFN-β), which are well known for their anti-viral activities, have the capacity to inhibit allergic inflammation. OBJECTIVE To elucidate whether type I IFNs have the potential to abrogate the lifespan and/or effector functions of human <b>basophils.</b> METHODS We cultured human <b>basophils,</b> and for comparison, eosinophils and neutrophils, with IL- 3, interferons, FasL and TRAIL, alone or in combination, and studied cell survival, effector functions and signalling pathways involved. RESULTS Despite an identical pattern of early signalling in <b>basophils,</b> eosinophils and neutrophils in response to different types of interferons, only <b>basophils</b> displayed enhanced apoptosis after type I IFN treatment. IFN-γ prolonged survival of eosinophils but did not affect the lifespan of <b>basophils.</b> IFN-α-mediated apoptosis required STAT 1 -STAT 2 heterodimers and the contribution of constitutive p 38 MAPK activity. Whereas the death ligands FasL and TRAIL-induced apoptosis in <b>basophils</b> per se, IFN-α-mediated apoptosis did neither involve autocrine TRAIL signalling nor did it sensitize <b>basophils</b> to FasL-induced apoptosis. However, IFN-α and FasL displayed an additive effect in killing <b>basophils.</b> Interestingly, IL- 3, which protected <b>basophils</b> from IFN-α-, TRAIL- or FasL-mediated apoptosis, did not completely block the additive effect of combined IFN-α and FasL treatment. Moreover, we demonstrate that IFN-α suppressed IL- 3 -induced release of IL- 8 and IL- 13. In {{contrast to}} IFN-α-mediated apoptosis, these inhibitory effects of IFN-α were not dependent on p 38 MAPK signalling. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Our study defines the unique and granulocyte-type-specific inhibitory and pro-apoptotic function of type I IFNs and their cooperation with death ligands in human blood <b>basophils,</b> which may be relevant for the anti-allergic properties of type I IFNs...|$|R
40|$|<b>Basophils</b> and {{mast cells}} share similar {{functional}} roles in immunological reactions. Both release various chemical mediators including histamine after crosslinkage of IgE or other homocytotropic antibodies {{on the cell}} surface. Furthermore, the density of <b>basophils</b> and mast cells in blood and tissue seems {{to be influenced by}} immunological reactions. In experimental animals, several reports have found that in vitro production of <b>basophils</b> (1, 2) or mast cells (3 - 9) from bone marrow or lymphoid tissues is dependent on some factor(s) produced by lectin- or antigen-stimulated lymphocytes.

40|$|The role of <b>basophils,</b> {{the rarest}} of blood granulocytes, in the {{pathophysiology}} of allergic asthma is still incompletely understood. Indirect evidence generated over many decades {{is consistent with}} a role for <b>basophils</b> in disease promotion. Recent improvements in procedures to purify and analyze very small numbers of human cells have generally supported this view, but have also revealed new complexities. This chapter focuses on our analyses of Fcε R 1 function in <b>basophils</b> in the context of understanding and treating human allergic asthma.

Since CD 200 receptor 3 (CD 200 R 3) was exclusively expressed on <b>basophils</b> and mast cells (MCs) using a microarray screening, we have generated anti-CD 200 R 3 mAb recognizing CD 200 R 3 A. In this study we examined the expression pattern of CD 200 R 3 A on leukocytes, and the influence of the elimination of <b>basophils</b> by anti-CD 200 R 3 A mAb on allergic responses. Flow cytometric analysis showed that CD 200 R 3 A was primarily expressed on <b>basophils</b> and MCs, but not on other leukocytes.

40|$|Background: P 2 Y purinergic receptors (P 2 YR) are G protein-coupled receptors {{that are}} stimulated by {{extracellular}} nucleotides. They mediate cellular effects by regulating cAMP production, protein kinase C activation, inositol trisphosphate generation, and Ca 2 + release from intracellular stores. The P 2 Y 6 receptor {{of this family}} is selectively stimulated by UDP, and selectively inhibited by MRS 2578. In the present study, we examined the effect of UDP/P 2 Y 6 receptor signaling on IgE-dependent degranulation in human <b>basophils.</b> Methods: <b>Basophils</b> were purified from human peripheral blood. The mRNA expression of genes encoding P 2 YR and ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (ENTPDase) was measured by RT-PCR. Intracellular Ca 2 + influx via UDP/P 2 Y 6 receptor signaling in <b>basophils</b> was detected using a calcium probe. The effect of UDP/P 2 Y 6 receptor signaling on IgE-dependent degranulation in <b>basophils</b> was confirmed by measuring CD 63 expression by flow cytometry. Autocrine secretion of nucleotides was detected by HPLC analysis. Results: We showed that purified <b>basophils</b> express P 2 Y 6 mRNA and that UDP increased intracellular Ca 2 +, which was reduced by MRS 2578 treatment. UDP promoted IgE-dependent degranulation. Furthermore, MRS 2578 inhibited IgE-dependent degranulation in <b>basophils.</b> HPLC analysis indicated that <b>basophils</b> spontaneously secrete UTP. In addition, <b>basophils</b> expressed the extracellular nucleotide hydrolases ENTPDase 2, ENTPDase 3, and ENTPDase 8.

40|$|<b>Basophils</b> {{have been}} erroneously {{considered}} as minor relatives of mast cells, due to some phenotypic similarity between them. While {{recent studies have}} revealed non-redundant roles for <b>basophils</b> in various immune responses, basophil-derived effector molecules, including lipid mediators, remain poorly characterized, compared to mast cell-derived ones. Here we analyzed and compared eicosanoids produced by mouse <b>basophils</b> and mast cells when stimulated with IgE plus allergens. The production of 5 -LOX metabolites such as LTB 4 and 5 -HETE was detected as early as 0. 5  h post-stimulation in both cell types, even though their amounts were much smaller in <b>basophils</b> than in mast cells. In contrast, <b>basophils</b> and mast cells showed distinct time course {{in the production of}} COX metabolites, including PGD 2, PGE 2 and 11 -HETE. Their production by mast cells was detected at both 0. 5 and 6  h post-stimulation while that by <b>basophils</b> was detectable only at 6  h. Of note, mast cells showed 8 – 9 times higher levels of COX- 1 than did <b>basophils</b> at the resting status. In contrast to unaltered COX- 1 expression with or without stimulation, COX- 2 expression was up-regulated in both cell types upon activation. Importantly, when activated, <b>basophils</b> expressed 4 – 5 times higher levels of COX- 2 than did mast cells. In accordance with these findings, the late-phase production of the COX metabolites by <b>basophils</b> was completely ablated by COX- 2 inhibitor whereas the early-phase production by mast cells was blocked by COX- 1 but not COX- 2 inhibitor.
