40|$|International audienceDevelopment in {{sustainable}} stormwater {{management in}} cities needs adapted modelling tools, which can consider urban water cycle {{in an integrated}} manner, by modelling hydrological fluxes as well as hydric state of the urban soil. The latter become particularly important when stormwater is handled with innovative point of view treating the resource or/and climatic aspects of rainwater. Yet circulations of rainwater within urban areas are complex and are not described in a detailed manner. Integrated urban hydrological models keep on being updated. This paper presents our work as {{a contribution to the}} development of such a model. A saturation module has been implemented to the integrated model URBS. The new model runs continuously at a short time step over long periods. Model evaluation is based on its capacity to reproduce saturation level and runoff measurements.

40|$|In this document, a {{statistical}} methodology for calculating the savings {{from the storm}} water/infiltration sanitary sewage separation (i. e., the ?M 1 model?) is presented. This method uses ASHRAE?s Inverse Model Toolkit (IMT) for the weather-normalization analysis. This document provides {{a review of the}} ASHRAE IMT, a description of the M 1 model, and provides an example to illustrate the methodology. In some cities, the municipal sewer system collects both storm water and sanitary sewage in the same pipes. During dry weather these sewers carry all the sanitary sewage to the wastewater treatment plant for treatment. However, when rainstorms or snow melt increase the amount of runoff, the combined flow of sanitary sewage and storm water can exceed the capacity of the sewer system, which can cause serious problems like the storm water and sewage mix are discharged untreated into the river or the sewage backs up into streets and basement. Storm water treated in the sewage treatment plant also causes unnecessary energy use. Sewer systems can also have unintended ground water entering the network, which occurs because of hydraulic pressure on the <b>buried</b> <b>sewer</b> lines infiltration. Therefore, separating the storm water/infiltration and sanitary sewage reduces the possibility of sewage discharge during heavy rain periods, and saves energy.

40|$|Aim of this {{research}} project was the development of criteria for watertightness-tests on <b>buried</b> drains and <b>sewers</b> with different testing media, i. e. water, low-air pressure and vacuum. Although {{there are a lot}} of standards for watertightness-tests on new sewers among the national and international literature, there are no criteria for testing old sewer-systems. Because of the physical differences between the testing media - water is incompressible but air is highly compressible - it is impossible to compare directly the results of tightness-tests done with water or air. For this reason equations were developed with which it will be possible to compare the results independent of the used media. The results of the research project offer a scientifically proved suggestion for tightness criteria depending on the used media, i. e. water, low-air pressure or vacuum.

The proposed methodology is used for reliability analysis of concrete sewers in Harrogate in the UK.

Vertical migration is estimated to be less than 12 feet below ground surface, and lateral migration is limited to the soil immediately adjacent to or within areas of concern. The proposed investigation will involve a combination of field screening for VOCs and TPH using the direct-push method and excavation using a backhoe to gather soil samples for analysis. Gamma spectroscopy will also be conducted for waste management purposes. Sampling locations will be biased to suspected worst-case areas including the nearby sludge bed, sewage lagoon inlet(s) and outlet(s), disturbed soil surrounding the lagoons, surface drainage channel south of the lagoons, and the area near the Imhoff tank.

40|$|Subsidences {{in ground}} surface {{are caused by}} collapses of {{underground}} cavities by internal erosion with ground water percolation around and through the cavity. During the last few decades, there is an increased record of road cave-in accidents. Specially, many road cave-ins were caused by underground cavities developed through defects in <b>buried</b> <b>sewer</b> and drain pipes. Researchers have found that, {{there is a tendency}} of forming cave-ins when the age of buried pipe exceeds 25 years. Hence, vulnerability of road cave-in accidents is increasing all over the world, with most of the <b>buried</b> <b>sewer</b> and drain lines reaching their lifespan. Although modern techniques like Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Geoelectric Tomography are available to detect the subsurface cavities, those technologies can only identify air filled voids separately from soil and having many other limitations. Maximum depth which can accurately detect is limited to few meters; in clayey and high moist soils this will be further limited to 1 - 1. 5 m maximum. Therefore, {{it is very difficult to}} detect cavities in deeper ground and it can ultimately cause ground subsidence by expansion towards the surface. Cavities are generally associated with process of loosening around it. Therefore, it will be better in detecting the loosened soil conjunction with air-filled cavity, rather than targeting air-filled cavity only. Thereby, even cavities in deeper ground can be detected by signs of capturing the loosened region in the subsurface. This will lead to improve the accuracy and efficiency of current methods in inexpensive manner. At present, cavity formation, extents of loosening and mechanical properties of loosened soil around cavity are not well addressed. There are several objectives of this study. First is to understand the extents of loosening with respect to the potential cavity size and to identify the parameters which affect the scale and rate of loosening. An attempt was made to create loosened soil in laboratory by dissolving water soluble material of pre-selected size and shape in Toyoura sand. The above mentioned objectives were achieved by conducting series of two-dimensional model tests by introducing a potential cavity and forming loosening by expanding the cavity by water infiltration and drainage. Effect of cavity size, density, ground compaction and rate of drainage on loosening and cavity expansion was studied through the two dimensional tests. As the second part of the study, quantitative study on mechanical properties of loosened soil was evaluated by triaxial tests after forming ground loosening inside the specimen. Simultaneously, influence of density, cavity size and location on scale of loosening was studied by changing conditions of the experiment. In each test, variation of axial strain, radial strain and volumetric strain during process of loosening was obtained and Poisson's ratio and shear modulus of loosened sand was evaluated. Furthermore, extent of loosening in triaxial specimen was studied by X-ray CT scan, in order to compare the different behaviour in two dimensional and three dimensional responses. Results obtained for Toyoura sand from two dimensional model tests show that, height of the loosened region is extending up to five times of cavity height and radial expansion is limited compared to vertical expansion. Furthermore, It was found that ground collapse around the potential cavity was higher when the cavity was located above the ground water table rather than beneath the water table. Cavity formed in compacted or dense soil was more stable compared to loose soil and extents of loosening were proportional to cavity size. Further observed that, suction supports the stability of cavity and abrupt failure of cavity ceiling was caused by rapid drainage. Extent of loosening was nearly limited to two times of the initial cavity height in triaxial tests. Density has affected the axial and radial deformations caused by loosening and lower density (Dr= 37 %) samples were observed with four times larger strains than medium dense samples (Dr= 63 %). Similarly, lower confining pressure (50 kPa) shows nearly three times larger deformations than high confining pressure (100 kPa). Loose sand and coarse sand (Silica) was subjected to further propagation of loosening under repetitive infiltration on already loosened soil. Evaluated Poisson's ratio of loosened sand shows complex variation throughout the entire test and difficult to understand the relationship with scale of loosening. This might be due to non-uniform distribution of soil and voids. Parametric study showed that Young's modulus of loosened region was 50 - 60 % of the non-loosened region. Overall stiffness of ground with loosening was 70 - 85 % of stiffness of controlled specimen. As a conclusion the cavities in subsurface are more vulnerable for cave-in and loosening expands at least twice of the cavity height. Overall stiffness of the ground is decreasing significantly even by having a smaller void. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 09 - 27; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士（工学）; 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科社会基盤学専...|$|E

It was the most expensive disaster for the province of Ontario. According to the Insurance Bureau of Canada, the damage of the insured properties exceeded $ 850 million. This event renewed a debate on a number of issues, such as decaying infrastructure, insufficient flood management, and inadequate standards. Don River, the main river crossing the city, is wide but not deep enough, which together with sedimentation contributes to frequent flooding of surrounding areas.

40|$|European {{foundries}} {{master the}} art of mass-producing cast iron pipes in the early 1800 s (Cast Iron Soil Pipe Institute 2006 : 1). Slow sand filters, buried pipes with bell and spigot joints, steam powered pumps, and water towers make for a universally applicable technology for urban water supply. Piped water systems enjoy a long service life and modest operational costs but require high initial outlays of capital. Also, pipe laying raises complex right-of-way issues (Meidinger 1980). Around 1850 {{it is by no}} means certain that buried water infrastructure can hold its own against contending modes of urban water supply. Cost-wise it certainly cannot compete against local water sources such as shallow wells and canals. By 1900 however, piped supply is establishing itself as the dominant source of domestic water in European and North American cities. Seventy years on, piped networks are the sole source of urban domestic water. i A parallel network of <b>buried</b> <b>sewers</b> carries the large volumes of piped water away from urban homes. How do piped water and waste technologies come to dominate domestic water regimes in European and North American cities? An early literature attributed the rise of urban piped water and sewerage to an unfolding understanding of the nature of waterborne disease (Baker 1949). Subsequent investigations by urban environment historians show that public health concerns play a minor role only in early 19 th century decisions to embrace piped water infrastructure (Juuti and Katko, 2005; Millward 2004; Tarr et al. 1984; Troesken and Geddes 2003). The introduction of piped water supply, in enabling householders to install waterborne waste removal systems, may arguably even have aggravated waterborne disease (Tarr et al. 1984). ii Urban environment historians place the rise of piped water against a background of rapid industrial and population growth in European and North American towns. The environmental stress accompanying 19 th century industrialisation triggers a crisis of urban water and waste that literally overwhelms city administrations (Tarr 1996). National and state governments respond by, late in the 19 th century, enacting laws and regulations that place responsibility for solving the crisis in urban public health on the shoulders of municipal administrations. City administrations respond by committing to large-scale and centralised technologies for handling urban water and waste. Much of the research published in English focuses, rather unsurprisingly, on the United States and Britain. This article attempts to complements our understanding of the emergence of the piped water paradigm with evidence from the European continent. Here, as elsewhere, waterworks are pioneered by private entrepreneurs under municipal concession contracts. Early concessions confer a limited degree of market power to concessionaires. In most cases the concession amounts to no more than a permit to bury piped systems in municipal soil. Gradually waterworks concessions grow in scope. The public health legislation underlying these arrangements provides concessionaires with a virtual monopoly on domestic water supply in the city. The next two sections sketch the development of piped water and sewerage technologies and the increasing involvement of municipalities with piped supply. Section four turns to the central argument. I show how the deepening commitment of municipal administrations to piped water occasions a shift in the legal brief under which concessionaires operate and the consequences this has for domestic water provision in the city.

The dynamic soil-structure interaction (SSI) problem is solved by means of a 2. 5 D coupled finite element-boundary element (FE-BE) method using a subdomain formulation. The numerical model is applied to assess the dynamic response of a buried pipeline to an incident wave field. First, plane harmonic Por SV-waves are considered to verify the 2. 5 D coupled FE-BE method by means of results available in the literature. Second, the response of a buried high pressure steel natural gas pipeline and a <b>buried</b> concrete <b>sewer</b> pipe to the vibrations generated by the operation of a pavement breaker during the rehabilitation of concrete pavements is evaluated with the 2. 5 D coupled FE-BE method in order to assess the risk of damage.

The steel pipeline behaves in the linear elastic range under the combined effect of the nternal pressure and vibrations generated by the operation of the pavement breaker. On the other hand, the maximum principal stress developed on the concrete sewer pipe is slightly lower than the tensile strength of concrete.

40|$|Traditional deep <b>buried</b> {{water and}} <b>sewer</b> {{services}} in northern communities can be prohibitively expensive due to deep frost penetration. Alternative municipal systems {{can also be}} uneconomic owing to cost-intensive freeze protection schemes. The integration of district heating (DH) systems with domestic services allows shallow burial of all services in a common trench by using the waste heat from the DH pipes as freeze protection for the nearby municipal lines, thus providing an economically attractive solution. A steady-state 2 -dimensional numerical model, based on finite volume principles, was developed {{as a tool for}} the design of integrated services systems. The model can predict the thermal field surrounding any number of pipes in any configuration and under a wide variety of ground conditions. Insulation boards can be modeled in any configuration in the soil surrounding the pipes. The main grid system is a rectangular coordinate system with local embedded sub-grids in cylindrical coordinates inserted around each pipe to reflect the radial flow of heat {{in the vicinity of the}} pipes. This numerical model was tested and proved to be self-consistent. Predicted temperatures were compared with temperatures taken around experimental pipe loops. Two systems of pipe loops with different diameters were tested, each system having an insulation board placed directly above the pipes. The predicted temperatures agreed well with the experimental temperatures. Anomalies found were explained by settling of the sand and deficiencies in backfilling in the region of the pipes due to the proximity of the insulation board to the pipes. These effects were modeled by inserting a thin air gap around the pipes, resulting in closer agreement between predicted and experimental temperatures. The model was determined to be a valid tool for the design of integrated services systems...|$|R
