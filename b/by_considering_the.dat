5|$|Partial {{differential}} equations {{can be classified}} <b>by</b> <b>considering</b> <b>the</b> matrix of coefficients of the highest-order differential operators of the equation.

5|$|In 1662, {{the book}} La Logique ou l’Art de Penser was {{published}} anonymously in Paris. The authors presumably were Antoine Arnauld and Pierre Nicole, two leading Jansenists, who worked together with Blaise Pascal. The Latin {{title of this}} book is Ars cogitandi, which was a successful book on logic of the time. The Ars cogitandi consists of four books, with the fourth one dealing with decision-making under uncertainty <b>by</b> <b>considering</b> <b>the</b> analogy to gambling and introducing explicitly {{the concept of a}} quantified probability.|$|E

5|$|The {{derivative}} of a function can, in principle, be computed from the definition <b>by</b> <b>considering</b> <b>the</b> difference quotient, and computing its limit.

5|$|The stable {{homotopy}} {{groups of}} spheres {{are important in}} singularity theory, which studies the structure of singular points of smooth maps or algebraic varieties. Such singularities arise as critical points of smooth maps from Rm to Rn. The geometry near a critical point of such a map can be described by an element of πmminus&1(S'nminus&1), <b>by</b> <b>considering</b> <b>the</b> {{way in which a}} small m minus& 1 sphere around the critical point maps into a topological n minus& 1 sphere around the critical value.|$|E
5|$|The {{levelized cost}} of {{electricity}} (LCoE) can be calculated by dividing the total cost to build and operate a power-generating system over its lifetime by {{the total amount of}} electricity shipped to the grid during that period. The amount of money is essentially a combination of the capital expense (CAPEX) of the plant and the interest payments on that CAPEX, and the discounted cost of the fuel, the maintenance needed to keep it running and its dismantling, the discounted operational expenses, or OPEX. The amount of power is normally calculated <b>by</b> <b>considering</b> <b>the</b> peak power the plant could produce, and then adjusting that by the capacity factor (CF) to account for downtime due to maintenance or deliberate throttling. As a quick calculation, one can ignore inflation, opportunity costs and minor operational expenses to develop a figure of merit for the {{cost of electricity}}.|$|E
