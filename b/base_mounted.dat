2500|$|Giants' jerseys are {{traditionally}} blue or red (or white with blue or red accents), and their pants alternate between white and gray. Currently, the Giants wear home jerseys that are solid blue with white block numbering, white pants with five thin blue/gray/red/gray/blue stripes on the pant legs, and solid blue socks. For this they gained their most renowned nickname, [...] "Big Blue". For road uniforms, they wear a white jersey with red block numbering and red [...] "Northwestern" [...] stripes on the sleeves, gray pants with three thin non-contiguous red/blue/red stripes on the pant legs, and solid red socks. The Giants' current helmet is metallic blue with white block numbers, which are frontally mounted and <b>base</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on either side}} of a red stripe running down the center or frontally mounted and <b>base</b> <b>mounted</b> on the red center stripe itself. The Giants, along with the Pittsburgh Steelers, are one of only two teams in the National Football League to have the players' uniform numbers on both the front and back of the helmets. The helmet is adorned on both sides with the stylized white lower case [...] "ny" [...] logo and features a gray facemask. The home uniforms are generally similar to the design used from 1966 to 1974, but with some slight elements from the 1956–1961 uniforms. The road uniforms are essentially a modernization of the design used from 1956 to 1961. Additionally, the Giants had a third jersey until the 2009 season, which recalled the Giants' solid red home jerseys from the early 1950s: a solid red alternate with white block numbers. These jerseys were used a total of four times, but have since been retired. They were used once in 2004 against the Philadelphia Eagles and in three consecutive years – 2005, 2006, and 2007 – against the Dallas Cowboys.|$|E

5000|$|The Camillo Silva {{designed}} Astore first flew in 1935. It was a tandem {{two seat}} sailplane intended for training, {{with the student}} in the rear, underwing position. [...] This seat could also hold a passenger for pleasure flights at flying events. [...] In addition the Astore was stressed for aerobatics. It was a high braced wing monoplane, with a wing built around two spars and constructed in two parts. Each part had a constant chord central section, and was straight tapered outboard, ending with rounded tips. Ailerons occupied all {{the trailing edge of}} the tapered section. The two parts met at and were supported by a low fuselage pedestal; they were braced on each side by a distorted, faired, steel V-strut, with its <b>base</b> <b>mounted</b> on the lower fuselage directly below the forward spar and its two upper ends attached to each of the spars at the outer end of the centre section.|$|E

Initial criticality at Ft. Belvoir (in Gunston Cove, off the Potomac River), January 24, 1967. It {{was the last of}} the eight plants to permanently cease operation. The MH-1A was designed by Martin Marietta Corporation. It remained moored at Gatun Lake in the Panama Canal from 1968 until 1977, when it was towed back to Ft. Belvoir for decommissioning. It was moved to the James River Reserve Fleet in 1978 for an expected 50 years of SAFSTOR. This reactor used low-enrichment uranium (LEU) in the range of 4 to 7 percent. The MH-1A had an elaborate analog-computer-powered simulator installed at the Training Division, USAERG, Ft. Belvoir. The MH-1A simulator was obtained by Memphis State University Center for Nuclear Studies in the early 1980s, but was never restored or returned to operational service. Its fate is unknown after the Center for Nuclear Studies closed.|$|E

5000|$|In 1990, Cadillac {{offered a}} lower-priced ($53,050) {{companion}} {{model with a}} cloth convertible roof and without the removable aluminum hardtop, and a model including the hardtop at $58,638. By midyear, prices were dropped to $57,813 for the hardtop/convertible and $51,500 for the convertible, which included a $650 Gas Guzzler Tax along with $550 destination charge. The fully integrated cellular telephone, which was equipped from the factory on just 36 cars this year, was available for an additional $1,195. Allanté's bumper-to-bumper new car warranty, seven years and 100000 mi, was three years longer than other Cadillacs, and an additional 50000 mi of coverage. Allanté owners also received a special toll-free number to call for service or concerns. Headlamp washers and dual 10-way Recaro seating remained standard, among other niceties. A driver's side airbag {{was added to the}} leather-wrapped steering wheel, eliminating the telescoping steering wheel [...] - [...] which retained its tilt feature. The analog instrument cluster - introduced the previous year - was standard on the convertible (available at no extra cost on the hardtop/convertible), however, only 358 cars were equipped with the analog cluster. The power mirror control moved from the right of the steering column on the instrument panel to a new location on {{the upper end of the}} driver's door armrest, while the power seat switches (previously mounted on the face of the seat base) were relocated to the lower side trim of the seat base facing the door panels. The 3-channel garage door opener <b>base</b> <b>mounted</b> on the header panel above the windshield was eliminated when a revamped sun visor design was introduced this year. Technological news was the addition of traction control - the first front-wheel drive automobile with a V8 in the world to be equipped as such. The elaborate system was able to cut fuel to up to four cylinders to reduce power and optimize traction. The electronically controlled shock absorbers were retuned to remain in [...] "soft" [...] mode for up to 40 mph. Previously, they entered [...] "normal" [...] mode after just 25 mph. A revised audio system allowed a CD player to be added as standard equipment, along with the cassette player. Of the 2,523 built for 1990, only five were exported - four to Canada and one to Germany. Allanté was available in eight colors this year, the most popular was Euro Red, found on 1,012 cars, while the least chosen was Gray Metallic, with only 28 made. Interior color choices (and production figures) were Charcoal Gray (1,343), Natural Beige (767), and Maroon (413).|$|E

40|$|From {{the first}} ideas of {{parallel}} manipulator proposed by Gough and Stewart, parallel manipulators {{have been found}} in many industrial applications. In the past two decades, a number of interesting mechanical devices and design methods have been extensively studied. However, most efforts are dedicated to six degrees of freedom (6 -DOF) manipulators that are now well known or 3 -DOF manipulators. There is a need for equipment providing more than 3 DOF&# 39;s arranged in parallel and based on simpler arrangements than 6 -DOF arrangements in application. This paper presents a new type of 4 -DOF parallel platform manipulator with <b>base</b> <b>mounted</b> prismatic actuators. The movable platform of the manipulator can translate along two directions and rotate around two axes respectively (2 T- 2 R). The kinematics model is formulated, which describes the inverse kinematics transformation. The kinematics simulation of this new 2 T- 2 R, 4 -DOF parallel manipulator is introduced...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1970 / International Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaA UHF (1520 MHz) {{telemetry}} {{system for}} use with artillery projectiles and gun launched research probes is described. The feasibility of a universal telemeter (UTM) is demonstrated {{which is based on}} the use of modular plug-in components available to meet a variety of instrumentation requirements, including ogive and rear mounting, thus, eliminating the need {{for the development of a}} special projectile telemetry unit for each application of in-flight projectile performance monitoring or gun probe experiment. The special, ruggedized components and techniques for pre-flight high acceleration testing are described. The components described include: broadband, omnidirectional antennas for ogive and base mounting in projectiles; a high gain, all polarization, fan beam receiving antenna; stabilized, high efficiency UHF transmitters; miniaturized voltage controlled oscillators; 8 and 16 channel commutators; button cell and g-activated reserve cell batteries; shock resistant, electrically compatible radome and encapsulating materials; modular assembly cases; and ogive and <b>base</b> <b>mounted</b> telemeter test projectiles.

50|$|The <b>base</b> <b>mount</b> is the {{connection}} between the tripod head and the tripod legs. Often the head will have a fairly large, flat base that sits on top of the tripod, and uses cork or rubber to increase the friction between the two, to prevent the head from unscrewing during use. The actual connection between the two is often made with a screw. A common standard for <b>base</b> <b>mounts</b> on photographic tripod equipment is a 3/8-16 screw on the tripod (a screw that is 3/8 inches in diameter, with 16 threads per inch) and a matching receptacle on the tripod head. Tripods intended for smaller photographic equipment that {{do not need to be}} as rugged (such as point and shoot cameras or smartphones) use a smaller 1/4-20 screw.|$|R
