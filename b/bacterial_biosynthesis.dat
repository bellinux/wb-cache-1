Even though plakohopanoid was isolated from a sponge, its component parts are clearly of bacterial origin, and its <b>bacterial</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> is very likely. Until now, C 32 hopanoic acids have been considered to be geohopanoids, i. e., diagenetic products that are formed through abiotic degradation of the biohopanoids present in bacteria.

Anaerobic <b>bacterial</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> of toluene from {{phenylacetate}} {{was reported}} {{more than two}} decades ago, but the biochemistry underlying this novel metabolism has never been elucidated. Here we report results of in vitro characterization studies of a novel phenylacetate decarboxylase from an anaerobic, sewage-derived enrichment culture that quantitatively produces toluene from phenylacetate; complementary metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses are also presented. Among the noteworthy findings is that this enzyme is not the well-characterized clostridial p-hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylase (CsdBC). However, the toluene synthase under study appears to be able to catalyze both phenylacetate and p-hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylation. Observations suggesting that phenylacetate and p-hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylation in complex cell-free extracts were catalyzed by the same enzyme include the following: (i) the specific activity for both substrates was comparable in cell-free extracts, (ii) the two activities displayed identical behavior during chromatographic separation of cell-free extract s, (iii) both activities were irreversibly inactivated upon exposure to O 2, and (iv) both activities were similarly inhibited by an amide analog of p-hydroxyphenylacetate. Based upon these and other data, we hypothesize that the toluene synthase reaction involves a glycyl radical decarboxylase.

According to Leinhos (1994) <b>bacterial</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> of IAA is known in many rhizobacteria and it is believed that approximately 80 % of rhizospheric bacteria can secrete IAA. However, Joseph et al. (2007) reported that the ability of bacteria to produce IAA in the rhizosphere depends on the availability of precursors and uptake of microbial IAA by plant. In the present study, over 70 % (Figure  4 a) of rhizospheric bacterial isolates from the Coastal region were IAA producers whereas 75 % of Western isolates and all the Mwea isolates were unable to produce IAA. Compared to the rhizospheric bacterial isolates, the rhizosplane bacteria had a greater percentage of IAA producers (Figure  4 c). These results differed from those of Sarwar and Kremer (1992) who reported that isolates from the rhizosphere were more efficient auxin producers than isolates from the bulk soil. The phyllosphere bacterial and fungal isolates from the Western and Coastal regions produced IAA in small percentages (Figure  4 e and 4 b, f). This is in agreement with earlier report of Lindow and Brandl (2003) who stated that despite of studies focusing on rhizospheric and endophytic plant hormone-synthesizing bacteria, epiphytes are also known to produce such substances.

Recently, the importance of antioxidant molecules on the biosynthesis of semiconductor fluorescent nanoparticles (quantum dots, QDs) by mesophilic bacteria was reported. The objective of this work was the isolation of psychrotolerant, oxidative stress-resistant bacteria from Antarctica to determine their ability for biosynthesizing CdS QDs at low temperatures. QDs biosynthesis at 15 degrees C was evaluated by determining their spectroscopic properties after exposing oxidative-stress resistant isolates identified as Pseudomonas spp. to Cd 2 + salts. To characterize the QDs biosynthetic process, the effect of metal exposure on bacterial fluorescence was determined at different times. Time-dependent changes in fluorescence color (green to red), characteristic of QDs, were observed. Electron microscopy analysis of fluorescent cells revealed that biosynthesized nanometric structures localize at the cell periphery. QDs were purified from the bacterial isolates and their fluorescence properties were characterized. Emission spectra displayed classical CdS peaks when excited with UV light. Thiol content, peroxidase activity, lipopolysaccharide synthesis, metabolic profiles and sulfide generation were determined in QDs-producing isolates.

Both ammonia and phenolic compounds are believed to be carcinogenic. Stimulation of carbohydrate fermentation in order to prevent accumulation of these toxic metabolites was induced by inclusion of inulin in a test meal or by addition of inulin to the daily diet, allowing us to distinguish between changes induced by the actual presence of a fermentable carbohydrate and effects caused by a long-term dietary intervention. When a single dose of inulin was administered together with the labelled substrates, a significant increase in faecal (15) N excretion, accompanied by a proportional decrease in urinary (15) N excretion was observed, probably reflecting an enhanced uptake of ammonia for <b>bacterial</b> <b>biosynthesis,</b> since an increased concentration of labelled N in bacterial pellets was found. A statistically significant reduction of urinary [(2) H 4]p-cresol excretion was also noted.

In agreement with their spectrum of activity almost specifically directed against Gram-positive bacteria, oyster defensins were shown here to be specific inhibitors of a <b>bacterial</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> pathway rather than mere membrane-active agents. Indeed, at lethal concentrations, the three defensins did not compromise Staphylococcus aureus membrane integrity but inhibited the cell wall biosynthesis {{as indicated by the}} accumulation of the UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide cell wall precursor. In addition, a combination of antagonization assays, thin layer chromatography, and surface plasmon resonance measurements showed that oyster defensins bind almost irreversibly to the lipid II peptidoglycan precursor, thereby inhibiting the cell wall biosynthesis. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed analysis of the mechanism of action of antibacterial defensins produced by invertebrates. Interestingly, the three defensins, which were chosen as representative of the oyster defensin molecular diversity, bound differentially to lipid II. This correlated with their differential antibacterial activities. From our experimental data and the analysis of oyster defensin sequence diversity, we propose that oyster defensin activity results from selective forces that have conserved residues involved in lipid II binding and diversified residues at the surface of oyster defensins that could improve electrostatic interactions with the bacterial membranes...|$|E

However, the contribution of host nutrient scavenging versus that of <b>bacterial</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> toward rapid intracellular growth remains unclear. Nutrients that contribute to growth of L. monocytogenes include branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs), amino acids, and other metabolic intermediates generated from acyl-coenzyme A, which is synthesized using lipoylated metabolic enzyme complexes. To characterize which biosynthetic pathways support replication of L. monocytogenes inside the host cytosol, we impaired lipoate-dependent metabolism by disrupting two lipoate ligase genes {{that are responsible for}} bacterial protein lipoylation. Interrupting lipoate-dependent metabolism modestly impaired replication in rich broth medium but strongly inhibited growth in defined medium and host cells and impaired the generation of BCFAs. Addition of short BCFAs and amino acids restored growth of the A 1 A 2 -deficient (A 1 A 2 −) mutant in minimal medium, implying that lipoate-dependent metabolism generates amino acids and BCFAs. BCFAs alone rescued intracellular growth and spread in L 2 fibroblasts of the A 1 A 2 − mutant. Lipoate-dependent metabolism was also required in vivo, as a wild-type strain robustly outcompeted the lipoylation-deficient mutant in a murine model of listeriosis.

Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology, 85 (6), 752 - 759. The definitive version is available at www 3. interscience. wiley. comPseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen; infecting insects, plants and humans. It is of particular relevance to cystic fibrosis (CF) patients where it causes pulmonary infection and {{the leading cause of}} morbidity and mortality. The CF lung environment selects for a variant of P. aeruginosa characterised by the overproduction of an exopolysaccharide called alginate. It has been hypothesized that outer membrane protein AlgE forms a channel through which alginate is secreted into the extracellular environment. Furthermore, studies have suggested that proteins involved in the polymerisation, modification and export of alginate form a multiprotein complex that span the bacterial envelope. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the role of AlgE in polymerisation and secretion of alginate. For this purpose algE knockout mutant was created in PDO 300. Results showed that AlgE does not have a role in alginate polymerisation however it has a role in secretion of alginate and stability of the alginate biosynthesis machinery. By performing FLAG epitope insertion mutagenesis the topology of AlgE was verified and site-directed mutagenesis further showed that the positive electrostatic field inside the AlgE lumen is required for efficient secretion of negatively charged alginate. By employing mutual stability analysis, evidence was provided for the existence of trans-envelope multiprotein complex required for alginate biosynthesis. Co-immuniprecipitaion assay suggest that AlgE interacts with periplasmic located AlgK and, most probably, this interaction is mediated by the peripasmic turn 4 of AlgE. Pull-down assays further showed that AlgK interacts with another periplasmic protein AlgX which in turn interacts with the inner membrane protein Alg 44. Based on mutual stability analysis it was proposed that Alg 44 interacts with Alg 8 which might interacts with AlgG as well.

40|$|<b>Bacterial</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> of {{different}} polymers {{depends upon the}} genetic traits of the strain in use and by the culture conditions adopted. Although the separate production of exopolysaccharides (EPS) or poly- 3 -hydroxybutyrate [P(3 HB) ] is well documented, much less {{attention has been paid}} to the relationships between the synthesis of these two major compounds produced by bacteria. The biosynthetic pathways of these polymers are not directly linked, but they can be produced at the same time in some microorganisms. In rhizobia the general conditions governing the biosynthetic pathways (the nature and availability of carbon and nitrogen sources, the oxygenation, the energetic and redox states of cells, the environmental constraints, etc.) seem to be the same. Since the extent of EPS and P(3 HB) production implies a significant energetic cost, a sensitive regulatory mechanism is required. A control of the synthesis and degradation of P(3 HB) in bacteroids is important to maintain an effective symbiosis. Therefore, a well-regulated P(3 HB) cycle results as a key factor for an optimal use of the available energy and for a balanced distribution of the carbon resources. Regulation of carbon flux into P(3 HB) production occurs at multiple levels, and the comprehension of this regulation is essential for understanding the physiological functions of P(3 HB) and possibly for applying this knowledge to industrial production of polyesters. AniA, a putative regulatory protein previously described (Povolo and Casella, 2000), and identified in the polyhydroxyalkanoates locus in Ensifer meliloti (Tombolini et al., 1995), was found to be involved in carbon/energy regulation under normal growth conditions. The occurrence of AniA orthologs (described in some cases as PhaR) and organization of the respective genes were described in detail in many different bacteria (Pötter et al., 2005). The present work gives a better inside of the role of the carbon flux regulator (aniA) in E. meliloti 41. Previous studies on other bacterial species indicated that the impaired synthesis of one polymer causes other reserve materials to be turned over (Breuer and Babel, 1999). A strain carrying a lacZ transcriptional fusion inside the aniA gene was constructed from E. meliloti 41 and from the mutant strain E. meliloti 41003 unable to accumulate polyhydroxyalkanoates (Povolo and Casella, 2008). E. meliloti 41003 accumulates also less exopolysaccharides as compared to the wild-type strain 41 (Povolo and Casella, 2008). The transcription of aniA-lacZ fusions was studied in the wild-type and in the phaC-mutant backgrounds under different conditions. We also showed that an EPS negative mutant of E. meliloti 2011 (strain H 3 a) could accumulate more P(3 HB) than the wild-type strain 2011. All together these results indicate a clear correlation between P(3 HB) and EPS biosynthesis. On the other hand, an aniA-Km mutation was transferred to different E. meliloti strains carrying exp-lacZ and exo-lacZ fusions. Phenotypic analysis of these double mutants showed a change from rough colonies of the single mutants to mucoid colonies in the double mutants (strains exoY-lacZ/aniA-, exoL-lacZ/aniA- and exoP-lacZ/aniA-) indicating an effect of aniA on EPS production...|$|E

We have designed, synthesized and evaluated the first D-glutamic acid-containing dual inhibitor of MurD and MurE ligases from Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (IC 50 s between 6. 4 and 180 [micro]M possessing antibacterial activity against Gram-positive S. aureus and its methicillin-resistant strain (MRSA) with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 8 [micro]g/mL. The inhibitor was also found to be non-cytotoxic for human HepG 2 cells at concentrations below 200 [micro]M...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{explore the}} {{possible}} occurrence of sources, other than GlgC, of ADPglucose linked to <b>bacterial</b> glycogen <b>biosynthesis</b> we characterized Escherichia coli and Salmonella ΔglgCAP deletion mutants lacking the whole glycogen biosynthetic machinery. These mutants displayed the expected glycogen-less phenotype but accumulated ADPglucose. Importantly, ΔglgCAP cells expressing the glycogen synthase encoding glgA gene accumulated glycogen. Protein chromatographic separation of crude extracts of ΔglgCAP mutants and subsequent activity measurement {{analyses revealed that}} these cells possess various proteins catalyzing the conversion of glucose- 1 -phosphate into ADPglucose. Collectively these findings show that enterobacteria possess more than one important source of ADPglucose linked to glycogen biosynthesis...|$|R
40|$|Herbaspirillum seropedicae is a {{diazotrophic}} bacterium which associates endophytically with economically important gramineae. Flavonoids such as naringenin, {{have been}} shown to {{have an effect on the}} interaction between H. seropedicae and its host plants. We used a high-throughput sequencing based method (RNA-Seq) to access the influence of naringenin on the whole transcriptome profile of H. seropedicae. Three hundred and four genes were downregulated and seventy seven were upregulated by naringenin. Data analysis revealed that genes related to <b>bacterial</b> flagella <b>biosynthesis,</b> chemotaxis and biosynthesis of peptidoglycan were repressed by naringenin. Moreover, genes involved in aromatic metabolism and multidrug transport efllux were actived...|$|R
5000|$|Viomycin is {{a member}} of the tuberactinomycin family, a group of nonribosomal peptide {{antibiotics}} exhibiting anti-tuberculosis properties. The tuberactinomycin family is an essential component in the drug cocktail currently used to fight infections of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Viomycin was the first member of the tuberactinomycins to be isolated and identified [...] and was used to treat TB until it was replaced by the less toxic, but structurally related compound, capreomycin. The tuberactinomycins target bacterial ribosomes, binding RNA and disrupting <b>bacterial</b> protein <b>biosynthesis.</b> It is produced by the actinomycete Streptomyces puniceus, that binds to RNA and inhibits prokaryotic protein synthesis and certain forms of RNA splicing.|$|R
