25|$|Each of {{the above}} {{instruments}} has its own range. The piccolo reads music in C (like the standard flute), but sounds one octave higher. The alto flute is in the key ofG, and the low register extends to the G below middleC; its highest note is a highG (4ledger lines above the treble staff). The <b>bass</b> <b>flute</b> is an octave lower than the concert flute, and the contrabass flute is an octave lower than the <b>bass</b> <b>flute.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following his death, Lateef's family {{auctioned}} off {{many of his}} instruments, {{in the hopes that}} they would continue to be played. Woodwind player Jeff Coffin purchased Lateef's main tenor saxophone as well as his <b>bass</b> <b>flute.</b>|$|E
25|$|This type of flute {{is used in}} many {{ensembles}} including concert bands, military bands, marching bands, orchestras, flute ensembles, {{and occasionally}} jazz bands and big bands.

25|$|Other {{sizes of}} flutes and piccolos are used {{from time to}} time. A rarer {{instrument}} of the modern pitching system is the treble G flute. Instruments made according to an older pitch standard, used principally in wind-band music, include D piccolo, soprano flute (the primary instrument, equivalent to today's concert C flute), F alto flute, and B <b>bass</b> <b>flute.</b>|$|E
25|$|The lowest sizes (larger {{than the}} <b>bass</b> <b>flute)</b> {{have all been}} {{developed}} in the 20th century; these include the sub-bass flute, which is pitched inF, between the bass and contrabass; subcontrabass flute (pitched in G orC), contra-alto flute (pitched in G, one octave below the alto), and double contrabass flute inC, one octave lower than the contrabass. The flute sizes other than the concert flute and piccolo are sometimes called harmony flutes.|$|E
25|$|The rhythm is {{laid down}} by prominent, syncopated basslines (with heavy use of broken octaves, that is, octaves with the notes sounded one after the other) played on the bass guitar and by drummers using a drum kit, African/Latin percussion, and {{electronic}} drums such as Simmons and Roland drum modules. The sound was enriched with solo lines and harmony parts played {{by a variety of}} orchestral instruments, such as harp, violin, viola, cello, trumpet, saxophone, trombone, clarinet, flugelhorn, French horn, tuba, English horn, oboe, flute (sometimes especially the alto flute and occasionally <b>bass</b> <b>flute),</b> piccolo, timpani and synth strings, string section or a full string orchestra.|$|E

60|$|The singers, on the {{establishment}} of a double service, began to absent themselves at least once on a Sunday, so Mr Harford and the ladies tried to arrange for the singing of the children instead. He had no knowledge of music, which was then thought a rather doubtful accomplishment for a young man, and Mrs Thorpe had, if possible, less, so all that could be done was for Dora to train the children by ear; and she found that their thin, shrill notes were held as painful by all save a few doting mothers, her sisters, and herself. The captain laughed at her, and finally promised her a grinding organ. It came; it could play four tunes, and all the singers were naturally offended. But on the first Sunday there was a great catastrophe, for when once set on it would not stop, but went on playing its four tunes long after the Old Hundredth was finished. Mr Harford waited to begin the Prayer for King George till it had finished, hoping that it would stop, if not {{at the end of the}} second tune at least at the fourth; but, behold, it started off with the Old Hundredth again, upon which Captain Carbonel emerged from his pew, and, with the help of Master Pucklechurch, bore it out into the churchyard, where it continued to play till after the service, when there was time to check its pertinacity by adjustment of the machinery. At its best, the singers--even George Hewlett--were much hurt, and the compromise was made that it never should uplift its voice when they were present in full force with <b>bass,</b> <b>flute,</b> and viol, but should only draw forth its four tunes when there were only the children to need the accompaniment.|$|E

5000|$|Many composers are {{beginning}} to write more pieces for the <b>bass</b> <b>flute.</b> These include Katherine Hoover's Two for Two, Bill Douglas's Karuna, Sophie Lacaze's Archelogos II, Mike Mower's Obstinato and Scareso, Gary Schocker's A Small Sonata for a Large Flute, Lorenzo Ferrero's Ellipse and Shadow Lines, Sonny Burnett's Stone Suite, Catherine McMichael's Baikal Journey and Ennio Morricone's Secrets of the Sahara.

Studies and concert etudes {{are beginning}} to appear that address the instrument's many challenges (physical balance, finger technique, air stream, overblowing, etc.). Peter Sheridan has commissioned and arranged new compositions in this area, including a set of 'Etudes for Low Flutes' by Hilary Taggart.
