25|$|To {{adapt the}} BMW M52 engine to the Defender chassis, the {{engineers}} {{were able to}} utilize some of the parts from the recently developed BMW M51 diesel powered Range Rover 2.5 DSE. They used the clutch housing, clutch, flywheel, and slave cylinder from that vehicle to connect the engine to the R380 gearbox, {{but they had to}} produce a new clutch housing adaptor (<b>bell</b> <b>housing)</b> for the petrol M52 engine in the Defender. The unique clutch housing adaptor was necessary because the petrol M52 engine is tilted 10 degrees compared to the diesel M51 engine and it needed to be longer to match the input shaft of the R380 gearbox borrowed from the 300Tdi Defender. Due to the large diameter gearbox input shaft, the standard BMW pilot bearing could not be fitted, so a unique pilot bushing made of Oilite bronze was developed. It had an inside diameter of 7/8 inch with an outside diameter of 32mm. A mixture of non-metric and metric specifications are common on Land Rovers. Other unique parts that were developed for the 2.8i were the air intake ducts {{both before and after the}} Donaldson FPG RadialSeal™ air cleaner, engine mounts, radiator cowl, cooling hoses, fuel lines, clutch lines, air conditioning system, engine wiring, tachometer gauge, exhaust system, and a specially tuned Siemens MS41.0 DME with a Lucas 10AS alarm in place of the Drive Away Protection system (EWS) used on BMWs. There were also major changes for the 1999 model year, which included updated instrumentation, different chassis and engine wiring, an updated cooling system with aluminum radiator, and an updated fuel system with new fuel tank. The 1.667:1 gear ratio LT230 transfer box gave the vehicle a “rev happy” nature which delighted many off-road enthusiasts and made the vehicle particularly well suited for traversing a wide range of grueling terrain such as sand dunes. The high gear ratio also helped the 2.8i sprint from 0–100km/h in 9.3 seconds, making it the fastest production Defender ever made.|$|E
2500|$|The 1971 {{and older}} blocks use a [...] "small" [...] <b>bell</b> <b>housing</b> bolt pattern that is {{exclusive}} to AMC and small Nash sixes. In 1972 the <b>bell</b> <b>housing</b> bolt pattern {{was changed to}} match the AMC V8's - its final use was in 2006 when the 4.0 was phased out. Four bolts on the cylinder block are matched to the transmission bellhousing where an adapter plate serves both as a dust cover - two additional bolt holes on the transmission bellhousing used on the AMC V8 are used to secure the dust cover. The 1971 258 uses the [...] "small" [...] pattern, the only year 258 to do so.|$|E
50|$|The light station {{includes}} a tower, keeper's house, equipment shed, oil <b>house,</b> and <b>bell</b> <b>house.</b> The keeper's house, now privately owned, is an L-shaped two story gambrel roof oriented {{to face the}} river. The tower is a circular brick structure, topped by an lantern house surrounded by an iron railing. The <b>bell</b> <b>house</b> is distinctive {{as one of the}} few surviving period pyramidal <b>bell</b> <b>houses.</b> The oil house is a small brick gable-roofed structure, typical of oil houses at other light stations.|$|R
50|$|The {{town was}} {{incorporated}} on 25 February 1892 {{and there was}} extensive construction of houses, summer cottages, and hotels.

2500|$|Instead of the {{standard}} AMC <b>bell</b> <b>housing</b> bolt pattern, AMC/Jeep engineers adopted the General Motors small V6 and four-cylinder bolt pattern (commonly used with GM's transverse-mounted powerplants) for their new engine, because the new AMC 2.5 replaced the four-cylinder engines that had been purchased from GM; and because AMC continued to buy the 2.8 L V6 from GM until the 4.0L I6 was introduced in 1987. The four-cylinder and V6 shared the same drivetrain components, whereas stronger transmissions were needed for the new 4.0L. The 2.5L also shared an 18mm threaded oil filter used with the GM 2.8L (ACDelco PF47 or equivalent) to 1986; when the 4.0L was phased into production with the XJ the oil filter was changed over to a 20mm thread size shared with Renaults until 1991.|$|E
2500|$|The 1990 season {{started for}} Earnhardt with {{victories}} in the Busch Clash and his heat of the Gatorade Twin 125's. Near {{the end of the}} Daytona 500, he had a dominant forty-second lead when the final caution flag came out with a handful of laps to go. When the green flag waved, Earnhardt was leading Derrike Cope. On the final lap, Earnhardt ran over a piece of metal, [...] which was later revealed as a <b>bell</b> <b>housing,</b> in turn 4, cutting down a tire. Cope, in an upset, won the race while Earnhardt finished fifth after leading 155 of the 200 laps. The No. 3 Goodwrench-sponsored Chevy team took the flat tire that cost them the win and hung it on the shop wall as a reminder of how close they had come to winning the Daytona 500. Earnhardt won nine races that season and won his fourth Winston Cup title, beating Mark Martin by 26 points. He also became the first multiple winner of the annual all-star race, The Winston.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>bell</b> <b>housing</b> {{bolt pattern}} {{for the old}} AMC 196 Straight-6 engine {{is the same as}} for the more modern early 199 and 232 (used from 1964 to 1971), but the 196 had {{different}} dowel pin sizes. AMC's 1956 to 1966 V8s used a different <b>bell</b> <b>housing</b> bolt pattern that was slightly larger in diameter than the six cylinder bell. When AMC discontinued their first V8 engine design after 1966, the <b>bell</b> <b>housing</b> changed; all 1966-up V8 <b>bell</b> <b>housing</b> bolt patterns are the same. The <b>bell</b> <b>housing</b> for six-cylinder engines changed to match the V8 in 1972 when AMC switched from Borg-Warner to Chrysler transmissions automatic. The flywheel also changed from 153 teeth (a common Chevy size) to 164 teeth (a common Ford size). Starter motors used with the 1966-up V8 bellhousing were sourced from Motorcraft which interchanges with the Ford V8 and some of their inline sixes (which uses a separate starter solenoid) - the Jeep 4.0 L uses a Mitsubishi-designed starter which has an integrated solenoid which is lighter in weight but retaining the two mounting bolts with a threaded top hole and unthreaded hole which bolts to the transmission bellhousing.|$|E

50|$|The FS5W71C {{gearboxes}} {{had different}} ratios {{to all other}} S13/S14. A key change was the layshaft gear which changed from 22/31 to 21/32, thus running the layshaft slower and at higher torque. This gearbox is considered weaker than other S13/S14 gearboxes. The front of the SR20DET gearbox with <b>bell</b> <b>housing</b> can be removed and a CA18DET <b>bell</b> <b>housing</b> fitted to allow the gearboxes to be swapped.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in 1980, {{the block}} was {{redesigned}} with a <b>bell</b> <b>housing</b> flange and a low-mount starter {{that is very}} similar to the small-block Ford V8.

The big bell design is uncommon but sought after by I-6 performance enthusiasts because it can be modified to accept a Ford small block V8 six bolt <b>bell</b> <b>housing.</b>|$|E
