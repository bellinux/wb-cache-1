5|$|The summit area is {{triangular}} in {{plan with}} ridges {{running to the}} north, south and east. The actual top is toward the northern corner and set <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> from the drop to Nethermost Cove. There is a rash of stones on the summit although the surroundings are mostly covered in rough grass, and several small cairns have been built. Other than northward, where the bulk of Helvellyn intervenes, the view is extensive, {{with much of the}} Lake District visible. Further ground is brought into view from the summit of High Crag.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} three days the Ottomans {{continued}} to launch incessant and ultimately unsuccessful counterattacks in an effort to recapture the ground they had lost. In total three regiments were dispatched. The Australians also brought up reinforcements, moving up men from two battalions from the 2nd and 3rd Infantry Brigades—the 7th and 12th Battalions—to hold the 1st Brigade's gains. Throughout 7 August, the fighting devolved into a series of hand grenade duels. To keep up the supply, Australians put about 50 soldiers to work at Anzac Cove manufacturing makeshift grenades out of empty jam tins: over 1,000 were sent up to the 1st Infantry Brigade late on 7 August. The fighting continued throughout the night of 7/8 August as the 47th Regiment, launched a determined counterattack; suffering heavy casualties, including the regimental commander, Tewfik Bey, the attack was unsuccessful in retaking the main front-line trenches, but succeeded in regaining some of the ground in the north and also pushed the Australians <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> way from The Cup.|$|E
5|$|Gadret and Dupont then showed {{climbing}} prowess in {{the first}} of three consecutive high mountain stages that preceded the second rest day. While Contador and José Rujano were easily the strongest riders on the day, the Ag2r tandem broke away from the peloton behind and secured third and fourth positions on the day. Gadret was third, which afforded him a time bonus in addition to the actual time taken. This moved him into the top ten {{for the first time in}} the race, in eighth. Dupont also entered the top ten after this stage, at tenth place. With sixth place the next day on Monte Zoncolan and attrition to other riders, Gadret moved up further, to fifth place. Dupont finished eighth on this stage to move up to eighth overall. Gadret gained further time against the vast majority of the field in the Giro's queen stage, stage 15, by finishing fifth and moving up to fourth place in the overall standings. Dupont struggled, coming in 22nd on the day, to fall to 15th overall. Gadret finished the race in fourth place, holding it after each of the remaining stages. Dupont took <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time against some of the other riders in the field in stages 17 and 20, to improve his final position to 12th. Gadret's fourth place was the team's best overall placement in a Grand Tour in their history, bettering the sixth place attained by Cyril Dessel in the 2006 Tour de France.|$|E

60|$|Creep up {{and watch}} them? Would Chingachgook {{have taken a}} risk like that? Hardly, unless insured with some good company. Then what? He was still {{undecided}} when he perceived the objects of his attention emerging. He <b>backed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> farther into the bushes.|$|R
5|$|Stage 11 into L'Aquila {{provided}} for major {{changes to the}} overall standings. More than 50 riders formed the day's escape group, and they quickly took 20 minutes advantage. Among them were Sastre, Wiggins, and 's Richie Porte, who was holding the white jersey as best young rider and, at sixth overall, was the best-placed man in the group. Sastre, Wiggins, and Porte all had multiple support riders {{with them in the}} breakaway who set strenuous paces to keep the group away. The main field, containing the Giro's top favorites, pulled <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time but was still nearly 13 minutes behind stage winner Evgeni Petrov at the finish. The day's result massively shuffled the overall classification. Porte was the only rider {{who had been in the}} top ten before the stage who remained there afterward, and took the pink jersey. Sastre and Wiggins, who entered the Giro as contenders but had fallen well back in the overall standings before this stage, both moved back into the top ten.|$|E
5|$|The magpie is {{generally}} sedentary and territorial throughout its range, living in groups occupying a territory, or in flocks or fringe groups. A group may occupy {{and defend the}} same territory for many years. Much energy is spent defending a territory from intruders, particularly other magpies, and different behaviours are seen with different opponents. The sight of a raptor results in a rallying call by sentinel birds and subsequent coordinated mobbing of the intruder. Magpies place themselves {{either side of the}} bird of prey so that it will be attacked from behind should it strike a defender, and harass and drive the raptor to some distance beyond the territory. A group will use carolling as a signal to advertise ownership and warn off other magpies. In the negotiating display, the one or two dominant magpies parade along the border of the defended territory {{while the rest of the}} group stand <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> and look on. The leaders may fluff their feathers or caroll repeatedly. In a group strength display, employed if both the opposing and defending groups are of roughly equal numbers, all magpies will fly and form a row at the border of the territory. The defending group may also resort to an aerial display where the dominant magpies, or sometimes the whole group, swoop and dive while calling to warn an intruding magpie's group.|$|E
25|$|That day, Brooke {{ordered a}} counterattack. This {{was to be}} spearheaded by two battalions, the 3rd Grenadier Guards and 2nd North Staffordshire Regiment, both of Major-General Harold Alexander's 1st Division. The North Staffords {{advanced}} {{as far as the}} Kortekeer River, while the Grenadiers reached the canal itself, but could not hold it. The counterattack disrupted the Germans, holding them <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> longer while the BEF retreated.|$|E
60|$|The speaker, and the schoolmaster, and {{the third}} grown person present, all <b>backed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> and swept with their eyes the {{inclined}} plane of little vessels then and there arranged in order, ready to have imperial gallons of facts poured into them until they were full to the brim.|$|R

500|$|In April 2013, James Valentine {{said the}} band was in the studio {{recording}} songs for the upcoming fifth studio album: [...] "The stuff we're working on now, it definitely has gone maybe a little darker in its sound, maybe <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more to what we kind of did on Songs About Jane, {{but at this point}} we do have all kinds of different songs and it is early".|$|E
500|$|When she {{returned}} in 2004, Nina {{was no longer}} shy and vulnerable. She had taken control {{of her life and}} became more assured. Goodrem welcomed her character's development and said Nina came back strong and confident. She also said: [...] "I think she had to grow up. If she didn't come <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit older and wiser, then she wouldn't have learnt and grown from what's gone on in the year that she's been missing." ...|$|E
500|$|Hugh McIntire of Billboard {{explained}} the video, writing, [...] "Everything about [...] "Locked Out of Heaven"– {{whether it be}} the video or the track itself– is retro. While the song references the early discography of The Police, the video takes us <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit further. From the style of their dress and the wonky-TV effects on the video, one might guess that Bruno and his friends are partying in the '70s. Only the Akai MPC sampler being played by a band member reminds the viewer that this video is, in fact, modern." ...|$|E

500|$|Armstrong told Bloody Disgusting {{reviewer}} Mike Pereira that {{he thinks}} [...] "visually" [...] Saw VI might be his favorite, saying [...] "We're kind of pulling <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit in the color palette. It's {{going to be more}} suggestive and not so vibrant, in your face like III and IV. It's more neutral and shows natural flesh tones. On Saw V, I pulled <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit and on this one, I pulled back even more." [...] He commented that the [...] "steam room" [...] trap was the [...] "best looking" [...] of them all. [...] He went on to say, [...] "It's big and expensive. It's got furnaces, fires and steam. It's multi-leveled. The most complex Saw. We had techno cranes flying through. It was pretty amazing." [...] Commenting on the [...] "carousel room" [...] trap Armstrong said: [...] "It's very carnival, playground-like. It's just nasty. [...] spinning red lights in there. It's really overwhelming to walk in and look at because everything is spinning." [...] Greutert said in an issue of the horror magazine Fangoria that the [...] "carousel room" [...] was, to date, the [...] "longest trap scene ever". He admitted that originally they had ten actors riding the carousel, but it was ultimately scaled down to six, to [...] "tie in to the [...] title". Post-production services were provided by Deluxe.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "We Ride" [...] was filmed in Miami and the Florida Keys in August 2006. It was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler, {{the director of the}} previous single's video, [...] "Unfaithful". In an interview with Corey Moss of MTV, Rihanna explained the concept behind the inspiration for the video, saying, [...] "We just wanted to reconnect with my peers, let them know I'm still a teen, I still have friends– but to make something provocative. The '' and 'Unfaithful' [...] were so out there, so we pulled it <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit. I'm chilling with my girls some." [...] The singer continued to talk about the choreographic content, saying, [...] "I'm dancing , like technical dance, which was a challenge... It usually takes years to learn, but we got it done in a few days. And it was beautifully shot." [...] The video was released to download via iTunes on September 18, 2006 in Ireland and September 20, 2006 in the United States.|$|E
500|$|... "I'm Goin' Down" [...] {{features}} an energetic rhythm, propelled by a heavy drumbeat by Weinberg, and contains a saxophone solo by Clemons. The music has a basic chord progression of A–E–F#m–D. In concerts in 1984, Springsteen introduced the song by describing the diminishing intimacy and sexual activity {{that can occur}} {{over the course of}} a romantic relationship: [...] " [...] you're making love to 'em all the time, three or four times a day. Then you come <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit later, and, uh-oh... it's like 'Are you gonna make love to me tonight, or are we gonna wait for the full moon again', y'know?" [...] The song's lyrics include lines such as [...] "I'm sick and tired of you setting me up / Setting me up just to knock-a knock-a knock-a me down" [...] and [...] "You used to love to drive me wild / But lately girl you get your kicks from just driving me down". The lyrics later turn into a stream of gibberish syllables.|$|E

500|$|After Kentucky's {{second game}} of the year [...] a 7169 loss at Indiana [...] Pitino noted that Farmer, who had 4 points and 4 assists in the game, was benefiting from extra {{one-on-one}} coaching sessions with Donovan. In a December 19, 1989, victory against Furman, Farmer attempted 7 three-pointers [...] tied for second-most in the game [...] as the Wildcats set an NCAA record for most three-pointers attempted in a game with 47, besting their own record of 41 set earlier in the month against Tennessee Tech. A week later, Farmer set a career-high in points with 21 [...] including three made three-pointers [...] as the Wildcats set records for the most three-pointers made in a single game (21) and most points ever scored against North Carolina, but lost the game 121110. After the game, Pitino opined that Farmer [...] "holds <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit" [...] and noted that he would expect Farmer to work hard in the off-season to reach his potential. The Wildcats closed out 1989 with a closer-than-expected 8679 loss against eighth-ranked Louisville, but local sportswriter John McGill said Farmer had his best game to date with 10 points, 9 assists and 3 steals off the bench.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. When asked about how he performed his comeback, di Grassi {{said he did not}} know but praised his mechanics for their work. He stated that the race showed that Formula E could switch to [...] "Heaven to Hell in one go", and felt if the third safety car period had not intervened, he could have managed his advantage over Vergne. He also revealed that on three occasions during the race, he believed that the possibility of him securing the victory had ended. Vergne, who finished in second, had mixed emotions, feeling that the victory was in his grasp but was happy that he secured a place on the podium and was in contention for the championship: [...] "We started very far away but I know I’m in the right team with the right car to win the championship. I think we’re coming <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit better and we’re getting stronger every race as a team." [...] Third-place finisher Bird said that it was [...] "a good race" [...] for everyone who watched the event on television and the sport. He felt the action observed in the race was positive for the series. Bird also said he was happy with the passing manoeuvre he performed on d'Ambrosio and reserved praise for his team.|$|E
500|$|The 4th Light Horse Brigade could render no {{effective}} {{aid to the}} 3rd Light Horse or the 5th Mounted Yeomanry brigades. It was strung out to the west {{as far as the}} Dayr Sunayd railway line and was being heavily attacked. Ottoman units managed to advance to within [...] of the 4th Light Horse Brigade's position; only {{at the end of the}} day was this strong Ottoman attack repulsed by machine-gun and rifle fire. Hodgson (commander of the Australian Mounted Division) ordered a slow withdrawal by 3rd Light Horse and 5th Mounted Brigades to high ground on the line Bir Summil–Khurbet Jeladiyeh. The order had only just been given when another Ottoman train was sighted moving to the south. It stopped west of Balin and disgorged a fresh force of Ottoman soldiers who deployed rapidly to advance against the left flank of the 5th Mounted Brigade. Two batteries of Australian Mounted Division were in action on the high ground north-west of Summeil firing on this fresh Ottoman force moving over the open plain in full view of the gunners. The artillery fire was so effective the attacking Ottoman advance was halted, forcing them to fall <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> where they dug trenches. Fighting steadily and withdrawing skilfully, the 3rd Light Horse and 5th Mounted Brigades had reached the edge of Summil village where the Ottoman attack was finally held. The attack ended at 18:00 in darkness.|$|E
60|$|For {{into the}} circle strode a great Lion--bigger and more {{powerful}} than any other lion there--and on his <b>back</b> rode <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl who smiled fearlessly at the multitude of beasts. And behind the Lion {{and the little girl}} came another beast--a monstrous Tiger, who bore upon his <b>back</b> <b>a</b> funny <b>little</b> man carrying <b>a</b> black bag. Right past the rows of wondering beasts the strange animals walked, advancing until they stood just before the rock throne of Gugu.|$|R

500|$|Despite his injury, Stewart said {{he hoped}} to {{participate}} in a planned two-day test session at Phoenix International Raceway. He also said he was worried about his crash because his legs and hips were tingling and his lower back was in pain. Stewart said the crash scared him and the tingling in his legs had improved after leaving the infield care center. Kurt Busch's crew chief Pat Tryson stated that he and the Penske Racing South team were relieved that the driver emerged uninjured after his crash on lap 256, and that they would do better at the next weekend's race. Gordon said his crash on lap 264 was [...] "probably the hardest hit I've ever taken" [...] and admitted fault for causing the crash. According to Kenseth, [...] "I {{knew he was going to}} get a run on me, so I laid <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit...We came off [...] 2 and I was up as high as I thought I could, and Jeff just came across. Whether it was on purpose or not, it just kind of wiped us out." [...] Gordon {{said he hoped}} Speedway Motorsports chairman and chief executive Bruton Smith (the owner of Las Vegas Motor Speedway) would install SAFER barriers along the inside retaining walls around the track. Biffle said there should have been no open gaps in the circuit barriers and that all NASCAR tracks should have SAFER barriers installed. After consultation with NASCAR officials, construction crews installed a [...] long SAFER barrier along the inside backstretch wall in August 2008.|$|E
