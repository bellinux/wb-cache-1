5|$|Daisy {{is another}} of Flower's daughters {{and the first to}} be {{impregnated}} by roving Lazuli male Carlos. When the Whiskers were temporarily split into two groups after a goshawk attack {{in the middle of the}} series, Daisy assumed the role of dominant female of the splinter group, but lost the role when her evicted sister Tosca found the group and took control. When the splinter group rejoined the main Whiskers, Flower discovered Daisy's pregnancy but allowed her to remain in the group. Daisy gave birth in an empty <b>burrow,</b> and after Yossarian found her, he helped to carry her newborn pups to the real <b>burrow.</b> The next day, Flower initiated a <b>burrow</b> move. In order to remain with her family, Daisy left the pups behind to die in the abandoned <b>burrow.</b>|$|E
5|$|Male mole crickets sing by stridulating, always underground. In Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa {{the song}} {{is based on an}} almost pure tone at 3.5 kiloHertz, loud enough to make the ground vibrate 20cm all round the burrow; in fact {{the song is}} unique in each species. In Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa the <b>burrow</b> is {{somewhat}} roughly sculpted; in Gryllotalpa vineae, the <b>burrow</b> is smooth and carefully shaped, with no irregularities larger than 1 millimetre. In both species the <b>burrow</b> {{takes the form of a}} double exponential horn with twin openings at the soil surface; at the other end there is a constriction, then a resonating bulb, and then an escape tunnel. A <b>burrow</b> is used for at least a week. The male positions himself head down with his head in the bulb, his tail near the fork in the tunnel.|$|E

5|$|The Texas {{pocket gopher}} avoids {{emerging}} {{onto the surface}} to feed by seizing the roots of plants with its jaws and pulling them downwards into its <b>burrow.</b> It also practices coprophagy. The African pouched rat forages on the surface, gathering anything that might be edible into its capacious cheek pouches until its face bulges out sideways. It then returns to its <b>burrow</b> to sort through the material it has gathered and eats the nutritious items.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of the Macadamia leafminer (Acrocercops chionosema), a moth, <b>burrow</b> {{along and}} disfigure the waratah's leaves, and are mainly {{a problem in}} {{lowering}} the value of cut flower crops. More problematic is the larger caterpillar of another moth, the Macadamia twig girdler Macadamia twig girdler (Xylorycta luteotactella) which can <b>burrow</b> into and disfigure the developing flowerhead.|$|E
5|$|A {{desert is}} not the kind of habitat that favours the {{presence}} of amphibians, with their requirement for water to keep their skins moist and for the development of their young. Nevertheless, some frogs live in deserts, creating moist habitats underground and hibernating while conditions are adverse. Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii) emerges from its <b>burrow</b> when a downpour occurs and lays its eggs in the transient pools that form; the tadpoles develop with great rapidity, sometimes in as little as nine days, undergo metamorphosis, and feed voraciously before digging a <b>burrow</b> of their own.|$|E
50|$|On 15 August 1942, whilst on a {{few days}} army leave, <b>Burrows</b> married Valma Ashcroft who had {{modelled}} for advertisements, the Australian Wool Board and women's magazines including covers for The Australian Women's Weekly.

40|$|The use of <b>burrows</b> by springhares was {{investigated}} in the Eastern Cape, South Africa using radio telemetry. Springhares utilized 4 – 27 different <b>burrows</b> scattered over areas ranging from 0. 6 – 28. 5 ha, with maximum distances of 170 – 1000 m between <b>burrows.</b> Springhares frequently changed <b>burrows,</b> seldom spending {{more than a few}} consecutive days in each, unless rearing young. The number of <b>burrows</b> used by individuals was correlated with the length of time they were tracked and, even after a year, some individuals were still occupying <b>burrows</b> previously unused by them. Males and females did not differ significantly in the mean number of <b>burrows</b> used, the mean area over which these were distributed, or the mean maximum distance between <b>burrows.</b> Springhares were generally solitary and occupied <b>burrows</b> were, with few exceptions, apparently avoided by conspecifics. </span...|$|R

5|$|Dumbledore picks Harry up {{from his}} aunt and uncle's house, {{intending}} to escort him to the <b>Burrow,</b> home of Harry's best friend Ron. On the way, they make a detour to the temporary home of Horace Slughorn, former Potions teacher at Hogwarts, and Harry unwittingly helps persuade Slughorn to return to teach. Harry and Dumbledore then proceed to the <b>Burrow,</b> where Hermione has already arrived. The next morning, Harry, Ron, and Hermione get their Ordinary Wizarding Level (O.W.L.) results, along with lists of school supplies. Later, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger follow Draco to Dark Arts supplier Borgin and Burkes. Harry is instantly suspicious of Draco, whom he believes to be a Death Eater.|$|E
50|$|<b>Burrows</b> by {{birds are}} usually made in soft soils; some {{penguins}} and other pelagic seabirds are noted for such <b>burrows.</b> The Magellanic penguin is an example, constructing <b>burrows</b> along coastal Patagonian regions of Chile and Argentina. Other <b>burrowing</b> birds are puffins, kingfishers, and bee-eaters.|$|R
50|$|When {{artificial}} <b>burrows</b> {{were offered}} {{in the field to}} T. adalaidensis lizards, all the lizards preferred vertical rather than angled <b>burrows</b> and juvenile lizards preferred more shallow <b>burrows</b> than did adult lizards. Observation of 36 artificial <b>burrows</b> showed a significant increase in lizard numbers during 2001-2002 and over three surveys. The study suggests that this local increase in population could be due to lizards locating appropriate <b>burrows</b> much easier. The study results suggest that artificial <b>burrows</b> could be a tool for conservation management of this species.|$|R

5|$|Most crickets {{lay their}} eggs in the soil or inside the stems of plants, and to do this, female crickets have a long, {{needle-like}} or sabre-like egg-laying organ called an ovipositor. Some ground-dwelling species have dispensed with this, either depositing their eggs in an underground chamber or pushing them into {{the wall of a}} <b>burrow.</b> The short-tailed cricket (Anurogryllus) excavates a <b>burrow</b> with chambers and a defecating area, lays its eggs in a pile on a chamber floor, and after the eggs have hatched, feeds the juveniles for about a month.|$|E
5|$|Paranemertes peregrina, which {{feeds on}} polychaetes, {{can follow the}} prey's trails of mucus, and find its <b>burrow</b> by {{backtracking}} along its own trail of mucus.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species such}} as tree {{squirrels}} and New World porcupines are arboreal, while some, such as gophers, tuco-tucos, and mole rats, live almost completely underground, where they build complex <b>burrow</b> systems. Others dwell {{on the surface of}} the ground, but may have a <b>burrow</b> into which they can retreat. Beavers and muskrats are known for being semiaquatic, but the rodent best-adapted for aquatic life is probably the earless water rat from New Guinea. Rodents have also thrived in human-created environments such as agricultural and urban areas.|$|E
50|$|The <b>burrows</b> {{produced}} by invertebrate animals can be filled actively or passively. Dwelling <b>burrows</b> which remain open during occupation by an organism are filled passively, by gravity {{rather than by}} the organism. Actively filled <b>burrows,</b> on the other hand, are filled with material by the <b>burrowing</b> organism itself.|$|R

They had four children: Betty Barbara <b>Burrows</b> Tanner/Kane (1919-75), Helen Eugenia <b>Burrows</b> Ferry (1921-72), Zelta <b>Burrows</b> Reynolds (1022 - 2000), and Loy Montrose <b>Burrows</b> (1925 - unknown date). Daughter Zelta married James Reynolds, son of Milton Reynolds, {{promoter}} {{of the first}} American ballpoint pens in 1945 and aviator whose crew broke Howard Hughes' round-the-world record for twin-engine propeller aircraft.|$|R
40|$|Artiﬁcial <b>burrows</b> are {{considered}} an important management and conservation tool for <b>burrowing</b> owls (Athene cunicularia). This species regularly adorns natural and artiﬁcial <b>burrows</b> with mammal dung and other materials, which remain between years so that previous {{use of a}} nest site is often obvious. Moreover, ectoparasites (ﬂeas) potentially overwinter in accumulated material and infest subsequent occupants. How evidence of prior use affects <b>burrowing</b> owl nest-site decisions is not completely understood. We examined potential effects {{of the presence of}} old nest material on reuse of nests by <b>burrowing</b> owls in southwestern Idaho, USA, during 2004 and 2005. We manipulated artiﬁcial <b>burrows</b> that owls used for nesting in the prior year by; 1) removing material from the entrance, tunnel, and nesting chamber and replacing it with fresh soil; 2) microwaving old nest material to kill ectoparasites before returning it; or 3) removing and returning material without treatment to serve as a control. Relative to removal <b>burrows,</b> odds of <b>burrowing</b> owl reuse of ‘control’ and “microwave” <b>burrows</b> were 3. 5 and 3. 8 times greater, respectively. Removing ectoparasites by microwaving did not increase odds of reuse relative to control <b>burrows,</b> and ﬂeas were present on nestlings in all 3 treatment groups. Presence of old material may help owls locate speciﬁc <b>burrows</b> when returning from migration or may provide physiological and feeding beneﬁts. Thus, cleaning by removal of nest material from previously used artiﬁcial <b>burrows</b> may be counterproductive if maximizing reuse of nest sites by <b>burrowing</b> owls is a management objective...|$|R
5|$|The French {{entomologist}} Jean-Henri Fabre's popular Souvenirs Entomoloqiques devotes a whole {{chapter to}} the cricket, discussing its {{construction of a}} <b>burrow</b> and its song-making. The account is mainly of the field cricket, but also mentions the Italian cricket.|$|E
5|$|The {{waters in}} which Kimberella dwelt were {{occasionally}} disturbed by sandy currents, caused when sediments were whipped up by storms or meltwater discharge, and washed over the creatures. In {{response to this}} stress, the organisms appear to have retracted their soft parts into their shells; apparently they could not move fast enough to outrun the currents. Some organisms survived the current, and attempted to <b>burrow</b> {{out of the sand}} that had been deposited above them; some unsuccessful attempts can be seen where juveniles were fossilised {{at the end of a}} <b>burrow</b> a few centimetres long.|$|E
5|$|This species mates for life, and pairs {{return to}} the same <b>burrow</b> year after year. The single egg is not {{replaced}} if lost. This is a long-lived species: one bird has returned to its <b>burrow</b> for ten consecutive years, and the lifespan {{is estimated to be}} about 16years. The age of first breeding is unknown, but assumed to be four or more years. Despite the proximity of the breeding sites, Zino's and Fea's petrels have never been found at each other's nesting areas, and Zino's is not known to hybridise with any other species.|$|E
