5000|$|This {{species has}} apothecia (cup-shaped ascocarps) {{that are usually}} {{attached}} laterally, often less than 0.5 cm in diameter, collapsing laterally and becoming rolled inwards when dry. The outer tissue layer of the apothecium, known as the ectal excipulum, has a delicate tomentose surface composed of hair-like, straight or sometimes coiled, smooth hyphae. The stipe is typically less than 3 mm long, with a central or eccentric attachment to the apothecia. Spores are roughly spindle-shaped (...) , smooth, and 5-8 by 0.7-2.8 µm. Apothecia grow on <b>bark-free</b> <b>wood,</b> especially oak, part of which at least is stained greenish by the mycelium. The abundant paraphyses, which may be entwined, are 55-95 by 1.5-2 µm, filiform, and septate with an unswollen, unbent apex that often extends beyond {{the level of the}} asci tips.|$|E
50|$|The fruit bodies grow scattered, in groups, or {{clusters}} on decaying, <b>bark-free</b> conifer <b>wood.</b> A snowbank fungus, it is {{most common}} at higher elevations after snowmelt in the spring. It is found in North America west of the Rocky Mountains. In 2010, it was recorded {{for the first time}} in Iran.|$|R
40|$|Biochars have {{traditionally}} been associated with soil amendment but are also useful {{in a number of}} sectors as they show potential to be cost-effective, multi-functional products particularly if they are produced from waste biomass. Current research is geared towards enhancing char agronomic value via physical, chemical and/or biological means although further studies are still required {{to gain a better understanding}} of the parameters which can be optimized to produce chars with specific functionality. This research set out to evaluate the potential for hydrochars and biochars derived from herbaceous and treated municipal waste to be used for nitrogen and phosphorus recovery from simulated wastewater, in addition to ammonia gas emission reduction during co-composting. This study also focused on providing more insight on some of the factors influencing hydrochar and biochar performance in nutrient-rich environments and investigating the potential for modifying char characteristics for enhanced nutrient recovery. Consequently, analysis of the physicochemical properties of hydrochars and biochars produced from paprika waste from a greenhouse, the treated organic fraction of municipal waste, greenwaste and pig manure has been performed. Comparisons are also made with relatively low-contaminant hydrochars and biochars derived from <b>bark-free</b> holm oak <b>wood.</b> Processing parameters include hydrothermal carbonization at 250 °C for 60 min, slow pyrolysis at 400 – 700 °C and gasification at 600 – 750 °C over 30 – 60 min residence times.
