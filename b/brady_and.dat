5|$|The Moors murders {{were carried}} out by Ian <b>Brady</b> <b>and</b> Myra Hindley between July 1963 and October 1965, in and around Manchester, England. The victims were five {{children}} aged between 10 and 17—Pauline Reade, John Kilbride, Keith Bennett, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans—at least four of whom were sexually assaulted. Two {{of the victims were}} discovered in graves dug on Saddleworth Moor; a third grave was discovered there in 1987, more than twenty years after <b>Brady</b> <b>and</b> Hindley's trial. The body of a fourth victim, Keith Bennett, is also suspected to be buried there, but despite repeated searches remains undiscovered.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} moors of Saddleworth and Wessenden, above Meltham, gained notoriety in the 1960s as {{the burial}} site of several children murdered by Ian <b>Brady</b> <b>and</b> Myra Hindley.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>Brady</b> <b>and</b> Hindley had {{confessed to}} the murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) decided that nothing would be gained by a further trial; as both were already serving life {{sentences}} no further punishment could be inflicted, and a second trial might even have helped Hindley's case for parole by giving her a platform from which to make a public confession.|$|E

5|$|<b>Brady</b> <b>and</b> Hindley {{visited a}} {{fairground}} on 26 December 1964, {{in search of}} another victim, and noticed 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey standing beside one of the rides. When {{it became apparent that}} she was on her own, they approached her and deliberately dropped some of the shopping they were carrying close to her, before asking for the girl's help to carry some of the packages to their car, and then to their home. Once inside the house Downey was undressed, gagged and forced to pose for photographs before being raped and killed, perhaps strangled with a piece of string. Hindley maintained that she went to fill a bath for the child and found the girl dead (presumably killed by Brady) when she returned. In Chris Cowley's book Face to Face with Evil: Conversations with Ian Brady, Brady states that it was Hindley who killed Downey. The following morning <b>Brady</b> <b>and</b> Hindley drove with Downey's body to Saddleworth Moor, where she was buried, naked with her clothes at her feet, in a shallow grave.|$|E
5|$|Many reviewers {{identified}} an {{allusion to}} the Moors murders, committed by Ian <b>Brady</b> <b>and</b> Myra Hindley, a British couple who killed children in the 1960s. Ryan Lambie of Den of Geek also found similarities between the episode and Ian Huntley and Maxine Carr's crimes. The A.V. Club David Sims emphasised the similarities between Victoria's taping {{and the fact that}} Hindley taped the torture of one of their victims.|$|E
5|$|The {{police were}} {{initially}} aware {{of only three}} killings, those of Edward Evans, Lesley Ann Downey and John Kilbride. The investigation was reopened in 1985, after Brady {{was reported in the}} press as having confessed to the murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett. <b>Brady</b> <b>and</b> Hindley were taken separately to Saddleworth Moor to assist the police in their search for the graves, both by then having confessed to the additional murders.|$|E

5|$|Brady {{was born}} on April 9, 1815, in New York City, the eldest son of Thomas S. <b>Brady</b> <b>and</b> his wife. Later, Brady would have seven siblings, two boys and five girls. The senior Brady had emigrated from Ireland to the United States while the War of 1812 was ongoing, and started a boys school in New York. When James was seven, he {{attended}} his father's school. In 1831 James's father had left teaching to become a lawyer, and he helped his father in his practice and in trials. In his father's office, James studied legal material tirelessly, and soon operated most of the firm's managerial affairs.|$|E
5|$|Former player Terry Neill succeeded Mee in 1976. At {{the age of}} 34, {{he became}} the {{youngest}} Arsenal manager to date. With new signings like Malcolm Macdonald and Pat Jennings, and a crop of talent in the side such as Liam <b>Brady</b> <b>and</b> Frank Stapleton, the club reached a trio of FA Cup finals (1978, 1979 and 1980), and lost the 1980 European Cup Winners' Cup Final on penalties. The club's only trophy during this time was a last-minute 3–2 victory over Manchester United in the 1979 FA Cup Final, widely regarded as a classic.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Johnson's life's {{work was}} almost {{destroyed}} when his caretaker declared him {{unable to pay}} further storage fees. Instead, Helen Harriton, Mary Beattie <b>Brady,</b> <b>and</b> others arranged with the court to have Johnson's belongings delivered to the Harmon Foundation with unconditional rights over all works. The foundation would use the works to advance interracial understanding and support African American achievements in the fine arts. On April 19, 1967, the Harmon Foundation gave more than 1,000 paintings, watercolors, and prints by Johnson to the Smithsonian American Art Museum.|$|E

5|$|In 1964 Hindley, her grandmother, and Brady were rehoused {{as part of}} {{the post-war}} slum {{clearances}} in Manchester, to 16Wardle Brook Avenue in the new overspill estate of Hattersley. <b>Brady</b> <b>and</b> Hindley became friendly with Patricia Hodges, an 11-year-old girl who lived at 12Wardle Brook Avenue. Hodges accompanied the two on their trips to Saddleworth Moor to collect peat, something that many householders on the new estate did to improve the soil in their gardens, which were full of clay and builder's rubble. She remained unharmed; living only a few doors away, her disappearance would have been easily solved.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Brady {{allegedly}} {{confessed to}} Fred Harrison, a journalist working for The Sunday People, {{that he had}} also {{been responsible for the}} murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, something that the police already suspected, as both children lived in the same area as <b>Brady</b> <b>and</b> Hindley and had disappeared {{at about the same time}} as their other victims. The subsequent newspaper reports prompted the Greater Manchester Police (GMP) to reopen the case, in an investigation headed by Detective Chief Superintendent Peter Topping, who had been appointed head of GMP's Criminal Investigation Department (CID) the previous year.|$|E

5|$|The Ravens {{first met}} the New England Patriots in 1996, but the rivalry truly started in 2007 when the Ravens {{suffered}} a bitter 27–24 {{loss in the}} Patriots' quest for perfection. The rivalry began to escalate in 2009 when the Ravens lost to the Patriots 27–21 {{in a game that}} involved a confrontation between Patriots quarterback Tom <b>Brady</b> <b>and</b> Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs. Both players would go on to take verbal shots at each other through the media after the game. The Ravens defeated the Patriots in the 2009 AFC Wild Card playoff game, 33–14. This {{was the first time the}} Ravens had ever defeated the Patriots.|$|E
5|$|Maureen Hindley married David Smith on 15 August 1964. The {{marriage}} was hastily arranged and performed at a register office. None of Hindley's relatives attended; Myra {{did not approve}} of the marriage, and her mother was too embarrassed—Maureen was seven months pregnant. The newlyweds moved into Smith's father's house. The next day, Brady suggested that the four take a day-trip to Windermere. This {{was the first time}} <b>Brady</b> <b>and</b> Smith had met properly, and Brady was apparently impressed by Smith's demeanour. The two talked about society, the distribution of wealth, and the possibility of robbing a bank. The young Smith was similarly impressed by Brady, who throughout the day had paid for his food and wine. The trip to the Lake District was the first of many outings. Hindley was apparently jealous of their relationship, but became closer to her sister.|$|E
