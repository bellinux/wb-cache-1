In the shrubs near the path where green waste was deposited by people from outside the organization grow yellow club fungus (Clavulinopsis helvola), gray shag (Coprinopsis cinerea), <b>black</b> <b>earth</b> tongues (Trichoglossum hirsutum), Arrhenia spathulata and Marasmius limosus. Those two last species are also in the Calamagrostide's glade of a pioneer wood of willow and birch, with moor club (Clavaria argillacea), Geoglossum cookeanum, lilac leg fibrecap (Inocybe griseolilacina), (Stropharia pseudocyanea), girdled knight (Tricholoma cingulatum) and burnt knight (Tricholoma ustale). Near orchid stations in the pioneer wood exist golden spindles (Clavulinopsis fusiformis), Hebeloma clavulipes, Hebeloma fusipes, Hebeloma pusillum, and also lilac leg fibrecap and burnt knight. Dog stinkhorn (Mutinus caninus) and Scytinostroma hemidichophyticum for their part, were observed in the shaded path north of the site on the edge of mature wood.|$|E
25|$|On January 22, 2016, the {{founding}} members of Arch Enemy formed a side project named <b>Black</b> <b>Earth.</b> Consisting of former members Liiva and Christopher Amott, and current members Daniel Erlandsson, Michael Amott, and Sharlee D'Angelo, {{the band played}} a sold out Japan tour in May 2016 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of both Arch Enemy {{and the release of}} their debut album, <b>Black</b> <b>Earth,</b> they only performed songs from the band's first 3 albums <b>Black</b> <b>Earth,</b> Stigmata, and Burning Bridges.|$|E
25|$|After {{the release}} of <b>Black</b> <b>Earth</b> the band {{switched}} labels, signing a contract with Century Media.

25|$|A 1997 report {{published}} in the Journal of Family Violence, found that among male perpetrators of spousal homicide, 60–75% of offenders had been drinking prior to the incident. In a 2004 study of domestic violence in the Central <b>Black</b> <b>Earth</b> Region of Russia, 77% of offenders of violent crime towards family members were frequent drinkers - 12% engaged in regular binge drinking {{three or four times}} a month, 30% three times a week or more, and 35% every day or almost every day.|$|E
25|$|Meck {{finally gave}} in to his wife's urgings and {{resigned}} from the civil service, at which point they had an income of only twenty kopecks a day on which to live. Nadezhda was right, though, to trust her husband's talent as an engineer. In 1860, there were only 100 miles of railroad track laid in Russia. Twenty years later, there were over 15,000 miles of lines. Much of this explosion was due to Karl von Meck, and his investments made him a multi-millionaire. The railway lines {{for which he was}} responsible included that from Kursk to Kiev and the highly profitable Moscow to Ryazan line, with its effective monopoly of grain transportation from the <b>Black</b> <b>Earth</b> Region of Central Russia.|$|E
30|$|Finally, it is {{noteworthy}} that no evidence on the use of <b>black</b> <b>earths</b> (<b>black</b> shale and black chalk) has been found to-date in murals and wall paintings.

25|$|There {{are three}} soil zones. The Northern forest-steppe zone covers the Danubian Plain and the Pre-Balkan up to 600–700m altitude. The Danubian Plain is characterised by the fertile <b>black</b> <b>earth</b> chernozem, that {{accounts}} for 54% of the zone's area, while the Pre-Balkan is dominated by grey forest soils (39%), which have good physical characteristics but are low in organic matter and phosphorus. The Southern xerothermal zone encompasses Southern Bulgaria up to 700–800m altitude and includes several specific soil types due to the more diverse topography and climate. The most common soil types are the cinnamon forest soils with acidic (cinnamonic) traces, smolnitsi and yellow-podzolic soils. The Mountain zone covers the mountainous regions above 700–800m altitude and has a zonal soil cover. The brown forest soils are distributed at altitudes of 1000–2000m, the dark mountain forest soils {{can be found at}} 1700–2200m altitude and the mountain meadow soils— above 1700m. These soils are typically shallow and prone to erosion and are usually acid to strongly acid.|$|E
500|$|Although <b>black</b> <b>earth</b> tongue {{species are}} {{generally}} not worth eating, Charles McIlvaine opined in his 1902 work One Thousand American Fungi that, if stewed, G.glutinosum is [...] "delicious." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{specific}} epithet glutinosum {{is derived}} from the Latin word gluten, meaning [...] "glue". The species is commonly known as the [...] "viscid <b>black</b> <b>earth</b> tongue" [...] or the [...] "glutinous earthtongue".|$|E
30|$|Terminology used {{to define}} <b>black</b> <b>earths</b> is general, vague and unclear {{with regard to the}} {{correspondence}} between the name of the pigment used in different epochs and its specific mineralogical and chemical composition. Furthermore, no distinction is reported in distinguishing organic and inorganic sources. Here, French, Spanish, German and Italian treatises and modern and contemporary literature have been consulted to understanding the use of this uncommon black pigment in different pictorial techniques. Polarizing Light Microscopy (PLM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analytical techniques are used to characterize both the raw materials collected in Veneto and Piedmont (Italy) and the <b>black</b> <b>earths</b> available on Italian and German markets. Results indicate that the studied materials are clay minerals rich compounds, in which the colouring fraction is due to the presence of carbonaceous matter and amorphous iron oxides. Depending on the microstructure, black shale and black chalk were identified. The properties of these materials when used in a fresco and a secco techniques are generally very good, as reported in the written sources, even if fading is observed when replicas were exposed in outdoor environment.|$|R
30|$|Indications {{concerning}} the possible use of black painting raw materials occur in north-eastern Italy near Verona, {{where it is}} well known that earth pigments have been exploited since ancient times. According to Federici [9], “black earth” from San Giovanni Ilarione is a black coloured marl - due to the presence of carbonaceous matter - which is associated with basaltic rocks. During the 1940 s three local mine owners exploited <b>black</b> <b>earths</b> and sold these as pigment to numerous local paint factories.|$|R
30|$|It {{seems that}} the final colour is {{strongly}} dependent on these parameters. Regarding grain size, the best results were obtained when the finest fraction extracted with dry and wet methods was used; in fact tinting strength of carbon-based pigments is dependent on particle size [1]. Naturally, the product available on the market gave very good results because its grain size and homogeneity have been carefully controlled industrially. Another important factor is the partial instability of the raw materials in air and sunlight as reported in Table  4. This behaviour was also noted in the case of charcoal black as carbon-based pigments produced by combustion may contain tarry material which can bleeds [2]. Finally, the collected <b>black</b> <b>earths</b> turned grey or faded when mixed with alkaline media such as lime and caseinates; this behaviour was not observed with commercially available <b>black</b> <b>earths</b> with similar mineralogical and chemical composition. On the other hand, good permanence was observed {{in the case of a}} fresco painting technique. An adequate discussion on this issue would require an in-depth analysis of the composition of the C-based fraction and of possible impurities which seem to have an active role in the stability of some black pigments with alkaline media [1].|$|R
500|$|Glutinoglossum glutinosum, {{commonly}} known as the viscid <b>black</b> <b>earth</b> tongue or the glutinous earthtongue, is a species of fungus in the family Geoglossaceae (the earth tongues). Widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, it has been found in northern Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. Although previously thought to exist in Australasia, collections made from these locations have since been referred to new species. G.glutinosum is a saprophytic species that grows on soil in moss or in grassy areas. The smooth, nearly black, club-shaped fruitbodies grow to heights ranging from [...] The head is up to [...] long, and the stipes are sticky. Several other <b>black</b> <b>earth</b> tongue species are quite similar in external appearance, and many can be reliably distinguished only by examining differences in microscopic characteristics, such as spores, asci, and paraphyses. First described in 1796 as a species of Geoglossum, the fungus has gone through several changes of genera in its taxonomic history. It was placed in its current genus, Glutinoglossum, in 2013.|$|E

On the other hand, <b>black</b> <b>earths</b> containing amorphous carbonaceous materials, such as Vandyke brown and Cassel earth have also been used as pigments. These humic-earth materials are composed of complex mixtures of natural organic substances derived from animal and vegetable sources with varying proportions of mineral matter [4].|$|R
