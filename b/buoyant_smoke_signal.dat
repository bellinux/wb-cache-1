[...] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times describes <b>Smoke</b> <b>Signals</b> as, [...] "a warm film of friendship and reconciliation, and whenever it refers to historic injustices or contemporary issues in Native American culture, it does so with wry, glancing humor. <b>Smoke</b> <b>Signals</b> is indeed poignant, but above all it's pretty funny."

[...] He also says, [...] "the cast is uniformly excellent in their roles, and Eyre's persistent use of long, trailing shots reinforces the story's elegiac tone.
