40|$|This study mapped the 52 {{nursing care}} actions {{prescribed}} for orthopedic patients onto Self-care Deficit: <b>bathing</b> and/or <b>hygiene,</b> Impaired Physical Mobility and Risk for Infection, {{according to the}} Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC). The study was developed at a University Hospital in Porto Alegre, Brazil, using the Delphi Technique as the content validation method, considering a level of 70 % of agreement among experts. Data were analyzed through descriptive statistics. Twenty-two experts validated the mapping of 51 nursing care actions onto 56 NIC interventions in two rounds. The objective was achieved because only one mapped care action did not reach the established level of agreement. None of the mapped care actions reached 100 % consensus, which evidences the various possibilities of comparison {{and the importance of}} validation studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to characterize the routine of a pediatric nursing ward in relation tothe performance of their users on the Activity of Daily Living - ADL: personal <b>hygiene,</b> <b>bathing</b> and feeding, aswell as point out the possible uses of assistive technology concerning the ADL performance. The participants werethe following; 10 members of a nursing team, 12 caretakers and their hospitalized children with ages betweensix and twelve. The characterization of the pediatric nursing was made through semi-structured interviews andobservation developed by the researchers. Results showed that 100 % (n = 10) of professionals, members ofthe nursing staff, reported performing guidance and/or supervision and/or performance of the following ADL:personal <b>hygiene,</b> <b>bathing</b> and feeding of children under their responsibility. Children remained in hospital fromthree to forty-five days and 75 % (n = 9) of them reported ADL dependence in personal care, 83. 3 % (n = 10) in the bathing activity and 16. 6 % (n = 2) in the feeding activity. Children also reported that they were helpedwith personal care, bathing and feeding by their caretakers. Caretakers identified differences in the performanceof the children’s personal hygiene (41. 6 %, n = 5), bathing (66. 6 %, n = 8) and feeding (50 %, n = 6) activities. Except for slight differences in the reports of the children, parents reported similar data and the bathing activitypresented the highest level of assistance. Recommendations on the use of technology in hospital contexts wereelaborated based on these results...|$|R
30|$|Thirty days {{mortality}} and functional status {{as measured by}} the Barthel Index were the primary outcomes of interest in this study. The Barthel index reflects functional consequences for daily activities that are immediately important to a patient post stroke (Collin et al. 1988) including feeding, dressing, mobility (walking on a level surface and ascending/descending stairs or an incline), and personal <b>hygiene</b> (<b>bathing,</b> grooming, toileting, and control of bodily functions). The Barthel Index is scored on a total scale of 0 – 39 (total functional dependence), 40 – 59 (partially dependent), 60 – 84 (Independent) and 85 – 100 (total functional independence). In this study, satisfactory functional outcome was defined as a score of ≥ 60.|$|R
40|$|Objective: {{analyzing}} {{the knowledge that}} families acquired on newborn care, before and after their participation in a mother-father-infant welcoming group. Methods: a quantitative and descriptive study {{that took place in}} a municipal health center, with 27 participants. Data were collected by a questionnaire applied before and after the educational activity, and was analyzed by comparing the answers of the items. Results: care actions properly modified were: the use of baby powder, soap, tea, objects in the navel, sun <b>bathing</b> time, correct <b>hygiene</b> of male genitalia, attention to child’s records and physiological eliminations. Conclusion: the families reported positive changes in newborn care through participation in health education activities, suggesting that the activity developed with caregivers can reduce risks to the health of newborn babies...|$|R
5000|$|For other {{self-care}} activities (such as dressing, <b>bathing,</b> grooming, personal <b>hygiene,</b> and feeding), several {{strategies can}} be used as a part of occupational therapy treatment. Environmental adaptations for bathing could include a bath bench, grab bars installed in the shower area, or a handheld shower nozzle. [...] For activities such as dressing and grooming, various assistive devices and strategies {{can be used}} to promote independence. An occupational therapist may recommend a long-handled reacher that can be used to assist self-dressing by allowing a person to avoid painful movements such as bending over; a long-handled shoehorn can be used for putting on and removing shoes. Problems with activities such as cutting meat and eating can be addressed by using specialized cutlery, kitchen utensils, or dishes.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Evidence {{has shown}} that {{informal}} caregivers complain about their {{lack of knowledge about}} causes and effects of stroke together with a lack of practical skills. Caregivers often ask for more information and techniques to improve their skills to take care of older people who suffered a stroke. Objective: To develop and validate an instrument that measures the capacity of informal caregivers to promote self-care in older people who had stroke (ECPICID-AVC). Methods: The development of ECPICID-AVC was carried out based on Nursing Intervention Classification (NIC) taxonomy. A focus group of eleven experts, composed of five rehabilitation nurses, four general nurses one statistician and an academic expert in gerontological nursing was created. Firstly, the focus group discussed and confirmed the structure ECPICID-AVC. After experts decision the instrument had 35 items with six different domains, such as eating/drinking, <b>bathing,</b> oral <b>hygiene,</b> transferring, positioning, (un) dressing, which were tested and retested in 186 informal caregivers who care for older dependent people after a stroke, living in community of Northern Portugal. Results: Factor analysis determined the validity of the instrument; the reliability was assessed using measures of internal consistency and temporal stability (test-retest). It was considered that the ECPICID had initial content validity and high internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s α=. 77 -. 90) ...|$|R

This thesis will consider: [...] how {{developments}} in plumbing and sewage and their related fixtures, kitchens and baths, parallel cultural changes throughout history.

The first might be considered a 'process of elimination' while the latter a 'process of preservation'. The two are not necessarily exclusive, but there are differences between them.

50|$|Where bathing is for {{personal}} <b>hygiene,</b> <b>bathing</b> in a bathtub or shower {{is the most}} common form of bathing in Western, and many Eastern, countries. Bathrooms usually have a tap, and a shower if it is a modern home, and a huge water heating pot. People take water from the tap or the water-heating pot into a large bucket and use a mug to pour water on themselves. A soap and loofah is used to clean the body after, and then rinsed again using the mug. People most commonly bathe in their home or use a private bath in a public bathhouse. In some societies, bathing can take place in rivers, creeks, lakes or water holes, or any other place where there is an adequate pool of water. The quality of water used for bathing purposes varies considerably. Normally bathing involves use of soap or a soap-like substance, such as shower gel. In southern India people more commonly use aromatic oil and other home-made body scrubs.|$|R
40|$|Plastic {{containers}} in {{the range}} of 5 - 20 L are widely used - especially in rural African settings - to collect, transport and store water for domestic use, including drinking, <b>bathing</b> and <b>hygiene.</b> The pathogen content of the waters in these containers has not been adequately characterized as yet. This paper presents the primary findings of a synoptic survey of drinking water quality samples from these containers and involved collection of bacterial indicator and pathogenicity gene data. In total, 571 samples of a variety of waters were taken in rural communities in South Africa and the Escherichia coli numbers measured. Of the E. coli positive samples, 46 % (n = 148) were screened for the presence of E. coli pathogen gene markers. Though synoptic, the survey provided many insights into the issues that drove the study. Container use markedly degraded water quality as judged by indicator counts, even where improved water supply services were in place. Household container use also appeared to promote regrowth or contamination of containers with pathogenic E. coli strains. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis also showed that the diversity of potential pathogenic E. coli carrying virulence genes was great. All seven genes screened for (Ial, Stx 1, Stx 2, EaeA, Eagg, ST, LT) were found in the waters, alone or as mixtures (number of different combinations = 31) including those characteristic of the more dangerous invasive and haemorrhagic E. coli strains. Given the central role of containers in the management of water supply to rural communities, it is clear the microbiology of these waters requires much further characterization...|$|R

Associated symptoms included a persistent dry cough that started 2 months prior admission and an unintentional weight loss of 20 pounds over the course of her illness. On lung examination revealed fine bilateral end-inspiratory crackles in both lower and upper lobes. Radiographic studies showed evidence of interstitial lung disease. The patient underwent bronchoscopy were transbronchial biopsies were taken and showed fibrosis of bronchial walls and lung parenchyma with prominent non-necrotizing granulomata that contained abundant polarizing crystalline material. Once the pathologic findings were known, the patient was re-interviewed. She reported that for the last 20 -years, she used baby talcum powder regularly at least twice a day, usually after <b>bathing</b> for personal <b>hygiene.</b> In addition, she habitually applied it to her bed sheets nightly. She was started on prednisone at a dose of 0. 5  mg/kg/day, which was gradually tapered and then maintained on a dose of 5  mg daily.

40|$|Activities {{of daily}} living (ADL) often pose {{significant}} difficulty for physically challenged people. Inability to perform certain ADLs independently viz. toileting, <b>bathing</b> and personal <b>hygiene,</b> can affect an individual's privacy, dignity and self-esteem. Use of sanitary napkins is essential for women in child-bearing age; but, it involves significant dexterity and coordinated use of the two hands. An woman whose one hand is dysfunctional, viz. amputees, stroke-induced hemiplegia or congenital disorder, would {{find it difficult to}} do or seek help for. Even advanced prosthetic devices may not help the amputees much, and stroke rehabilitation is a long process. Therefore, a design intervention is imperative to save the dignity of such members with special needs in our society. The proposed design enables subjects with one functional hand to use a common sanitary napkin with a sticky patch for attaching it to knickers. It is basically a structure with two foot-rests and a raised portion in the middle for supporting the central narrow region of lowering knickers, and placing the opened pad for pressing and sticking. The same device also aids in removing, rolling and wrapping the used napkin with one hand. The design is sized to accommodate different anthropometry and napkin sizes. The effectiveness of the device has been teste...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Research in {{the past}} decade has {{revealed}} average to poor menstrual health among many Iranian girls. The present study investigated the effectiveness of a health promotion project on improving menstrual health in adolescent girls in Iran. Methods A quasi-experimental study was conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the health intervention program. A total of 698 students (study participants and controls) in several schools in Mazandaran province, Iran were included. The project comprised 10 two-hour educational sessions. Educational topics included the significance of adolescence, physical and emotional changes during adolescence, pubertal and menstruation health and premenstrual syndrome. A self-administered questionnaire measuring demographic characteristics, behaviors during menstruation, menstrual patterns, sources of information about menstruation and personal health data was administered. The questionnaire was administered to all participating students after the experimental group received the training. Results Among the most significant results was the impact of educational sessions on <b>bathing</b> and genital <b>hygiene.</b> A total of 61. 6 % in the experimental group compared with 49. 3 % in the control group engaged in usual bathing during menstruation (p = 0. 002). Individual health status was significantly statistically correlated with menstrual health. Attitude towards menstruation was also significantly related to menstrual health. Conclusions The present study confirms that educational interventions, such as the health promotion project in this study, can be quite effective in promoting menstrual health. </p...|$|R
60|$|There is one point, ere I have done, where I {{may go to}} meet criticism. I {{have said}} nothing of faulty <b>hygiene,</b> <b>bathing</b> during fevers, mistaken {{treatment}} of children, native doctoring, or abortion--all causes frequently adduced. And I have said nothing of them because they are conditions common to both epochs, and even more efficient in the past than in the present. Was it not the same with unchastity, it may be asked? Was not the Polynesian always unchaste? Doubtless he was so always: doubtless he is more so since the coming of his remarkably chaste visitors from Europe. Take the Hawaiian account of Cook: I have no doubt it is entirely fair. Take Krusenstern's candid, almost innocent, description of a Russian man-of-war at the Marquesas; consider the disgraceful history of missions in Hawaii itself, where (in the war of lust) the American missionaries were once shelled by an English adventurer, and once raided and mishandled by the crew of an American warship; add the practice of whaling fleets to call at the Marquesas, and carry off a complement of women for the cruise; consider, besides, how the whites were at first regarded {{in the light of}} demi-gods, as appears plainly in the reception of Cook upon Hawaii; and again, in the story of the discovery of Tutuila, when the really decent women of Samoa prostituted themselves in public to the French; and bear in mind how it was the custom of the adventurers, and we may almost say the business of the missionaries, to deride and infract even the most salutary tapus. Here we see every engine of dissolution directed at once against a virtue never and nowhere very strong or popular; and the result, even in the most degraded islands, has been further degradation. Mr. Lawes, the missionary of Savage Island, told me the standard of female chastity had declined there since the coming of the whites. In heathen time, if a girl gave birth to a bastard, her father or brother would dash the infant down the cliffs; and to-day the scandal would be small. Or take the Marquesas. Stanislao Moanatini told me that in his own recollection the young were strictly guarded; they were not suffered so much as to look upon one another in the street, but passed (so my informant put it) like dogs; and the other day the whole school-children of Nuka-hiva and Ua-pu escaped in a body to the woods, and lived there for a fortnight in promiscuous liberty. Readers of travels may perhaps exclaim at my authority, and declare themselves better informed. I should prefer the statement of an intelligent native like Stanislao (even if it stood alone, which it is far from doing) to the report of the most honest traveller. A ship of war comes to a haven, anchors, lands a party, receives and returns a visit, and the captain writes a chapter on the manners of the island. It is not considered what class is mostly seen. Yet we should not be pleased if a Lascar foremast hand were to judge England by the ladies who parade Ratcliffe Highway, and the gentlemen who share with them their hire. Stanislao's opinion of a decay of virtue even in these unvirtuous islands has been supported to me by others; his very example, the progress of dissolution amongst the young, is adduced by Mr. Bishop in Hawaii. And so far as Marquesans are concerned, we might have hazarded a guess of some decline in manners. I do not think that any race could ever have prospered or multiplied with such as now obtain; I am sure they would have been never at the pains to count paternal kinship. It is not possible to give details; suffice it that their manners appear to be imitated from the dreams of ignorant and vicious children, and their debauches persevered in until energy, reason, and almost life itself are in abeyance.|$|R
