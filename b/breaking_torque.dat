40|$|This paper {{starts from}} the {{conclusion}} that, {{in case of}} low power reluctance synchronous motors, it is imposed to consider {{the resistance of the}} armature winding because its value may not be neglected. In order to study the influence of this resistance upon the maximum torque, there are presented the computation relations of the reactive electromagnetic torque, of the active reluctance torque and of the <b>breaking</b> <b>torque.</b> With their help there have been plotted, in per unit, a few static angular characteristics, for different values of the stator resistance. The results of the simulations have been confronted with a few experimental data corresponding to a reluctance synchronous motor rated at 1, 5 kW.

50|$|Another {{difference}} between semi-trucks and cars {{is the way}} the clutch is set up. On an automobile, the clutch pedal is depressed full stroke to the floor for every gear shift, to ensure the gearbox is disengaged from the engine. On a semi-truck with constant mesh transmission (non synchronized), such as by the Eaton Roadranger series, not only is double clutching required, but a clutch brake is required as well. The clutch brake stops the rotation of the gears, and allows the truck to be put into gear without grinding when stationary. The clutch is pressed to the floor only to allow smooth engagement of low gears when starting from a full stop; when the truck is moving, the clutch pedal is pressed only far enough to <b>break</b> <b>torque</b> for gear changes.|$|R

40|$|Several {{tests were}} carried out on a 1, 640 kW (2, 200 hp) diesel engine {{operating}} in two different sets of conditions: a bench test and route test (when the engine was located on a mining truck). The engine was mounted on a dynamometer for {{the first set of}} conditions. The parameters measured were <b>break</b> <b>torque,</b> cylinder and air inlet temperatures, exhaust gas temperature and both fuel consumption and airflow. Gas emissions were also recorded. The engine operated during {{the first phase of the}} study according to a test protocol allowing real work conditions to be simulated during a typical cycle present on the operation route. Afterwards, the mining truck was instrumented for the second set of working conditions and the corresponding monitoring work was done while the truck was working on the route assigned by the truck’s operator. A comparative analysis was then made of the re- sults obtained in the two sets of working conditions. This analysis led to observing that the results obtained in the two tests had a very similar pattern and thus led to validating the results obtained in the bench test...|$|R
40|$|Introduction {{of novel}} fuels, such as {{mixtures}} of ethanol or butanol with hydrocarbons, requires new fundamental understanding of in-cylinder combustion properties in modern direct-injection spark-ignition engines since those {{can be quite}} sensitive to fuel properties. Gasoline and its blends with 25 % ethanol and butanol at 25 % and 16 % per volume (the latter equivalent to 10 % ethanol blending ratio in terms of oxygen content) were studied in comparison to gasoline, ethanol, and butanol combustion. The same alcohol blending ratios were also employed with iso-octane as the base component for direct comparison. Testing was performed at 1500 RPM with 0. 5 bar intake plenum pressure using 20 °C or 80 °C engine coolant temperature. Thermodynamic parameters were derived using in-cylinder pressure analysis for stoichiometric (ϕ = 1. 0) and lean (ϕ = 0. 83) fueling over a range of spark advances. Additionally, high speed color and greyscale chemiluminescence imaging was conducted at gasoline’s maximum <b>break</b> <b>torque</b> spark timing, calculating flame growth speeds, flame roundness, and centroid motion. Laminar burning velocity data from the literature and in-cylinder flow measurements from the same engine were used for interpretation. Overall, the analysis showed small differences between gasoline and the blends in general, but showed changes for the pure alcohols with typically much faster flame progression for ethanol and issues with the combustion stability of butanol at low engine temperatures. Alcohol blending, particularly with iso-octane, showed some benefits at lean conditions...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{the present}} biomechanical study, the {{torsional}} stability of different interference screws, made of bovine bone, was tested. Interference screws derived from bovine bone are a possible biological alternative to conventional metallic or bioabsorbable polymer interference screws. Methods: In {{the first part}} of the study we compared the torsional stability of self-made 8 mm Interference screws (BC) and a commercial 8 mm interference screw (Tutofix®). Furthermore, we compared the torsional strength of BC screws with different diameters. For screwing in, a hexagon head and an octagon head were tested. Maximum <b>breaking</b> <b>torques</b> in polymethyl methacrylate resin were recorded by means of an electronic torque screw driver. In the second part of the study the tibial part of a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft was fixed in porcine test specimens using an 8 mm BC screw and the maximum insertion torques were recorded. Each interference screw type was tested 5 times. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the different 8 mm interference screws (p = 0. 121). Pairwise comparisons did not reveal statistically significant differences, either. It was demonstrated for the BC screws, that a larger screw diameter significantly leads to higher torsional stability (p = 9. 779 × 10 - 5). Pairwise comparisons showed a significantly lower torsional stability for the 7 mm BC screw than for the 8 mm BC screw (p = 0. 0079) and the 9 mm BC screw (p = 0. 0079).

40|$|A {{gyrostabiliser}} {{control system}} and method for stabilising marine vessel motion based on precession information only. The control system employs an Automatic Gain Control (AGC) precession controller (60). This system operates with a gain factor {{that is always}} being gradually minimized so as to let the gyro flywheel (12) develop as much precession as possible - the higher the precession, the higher the roll stabilising moment. This continuous gain change provides adaptation to changes in sea state and sailing conditions. The system effectively predicts the likelihood of maximum precession being reached. Should this event be detected, then the gain is rapidly increased so as to provide a <b>breaking</b> precession <b>torque.</b> Once the event has passed, the system again attempts to gradually decrease the gain...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The aim was to formulate ergonomics criteria {{to assist in the}} design and evaluation of various commonly used packages so that they are well adapted to the needs, capabilities and limitations of consumers. The consumers used in the study included male and female able-bodied subjects, some of whom were elderly; and the disabled, who suffered from arthritis, Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, or one-handed function (hemiplegics or amputees). The design criteria took the form of normative data. These were derived, by experiment, with subjects handling specially designed apparatus which closely simulated the characteristics of real packages. The norms were the torques and forces that the weak, average and strong subjects could exert on a range of packages. The norms were related to the <b>breaking</b> <b>torques</b> and <b>breaking</b> forces of packages found in the market place. It was shown that many of these packages require opening torques and forces which are well beyond the capabilities of the weaker sections of the sample. New methods for representing the torques which people can exert were derived, involving the calculation of ratios of centiles between and within groups for comfortable and maximum exertions of torque. It is suggested that this method, which has considerable promise, be further validated in future studies involving not only the description of forces and torques, but also that of the reaches, carrying and lifting capacity, the articulation, pushing and pulling capacity, and physical endurance of human subjects. The promise lies in the short-hand derivation of the capabilities of weaker segments of the population, who are difficult to obtain in large numbers, from studies involving small samples from the fit and able population...|$|R

30|$|The {{principle}} of EDM and EDM drilling is same except that during drilling process the electrode rotates and removes the burrs effectively with fluid pressure {{supplied by the}} channels in the electrode. Drilling micro-holes with conventional methods is often extremely difficult if not impossible. After drilling micro-holes, the geometrical accuracy was distorted and also the surface quality {{was not so much}} effective. EDM drilling is often the only practical method for producing such holes. As conventional drills enter or exit, they can <b>break</b> if <b>torque</b> is not carefully controlled. Small broken drills are often difficult to remove from the workpiece, and time is wasted replacing broken drills and parts may have to be scrapped. With EDM drilling, torque does not exist since the electrode never contacts the piece (Simon and Grama 2011). Song et al. (2009) drilled on cobalt-bonded tungsten carbide (WC–Co) with micro-electrical discharge machining. Researcher utilized bipolar pulse power source to prevent electrolytic corrosion in the machined holes.|$|R

Due to the unpredictability of the natural wind, {{this study is to}} evaluate the practicality for harnessing waste {{energy from the}} air conditioner exhaust units which are a more constant and predictable source available in the buildings. A prototype of the micro wind turbine has been designed to minimize the negative effect of the exhaust sources. After the micro wind turbine was manufactured, the performance of the turbine was tested in the selected air conditioner exhaust unit. Increasing the rotor solidity and decreasing the resistance of the generator contribute to improved starting torque and decreased generator <b>break</b> in <b>torque</b> respectively in the design.

40|$|Inflammatory {{myopathy}} is a {{group of}} disorders with progressive muscle weakness being the major symptom. Quantitative assessment of muscle function is important when evaluating the response of these conditions to treatment and various methods, including manual muscle testing, myometry and isokinetic dynamometry, have been used for the assessment of muscle strength. The aims of this study were to compare, in patients with inflammatory myopathy, the maximum isometric quadriceps and hamstrings torques using a hand-held myometer and a dynamometer (Kin-Com), and to compare make and break tests using myometry. The results showed that in stronger quadriceps the myometer tests underestimated maximum torque as measured with the dynamometer, and that in weaker quadriceps {{there was no difference in}} torque with the different methods. There was no difference in hamstrings make torques for the two instruments. The <b>break</b> myometer <b>torques</b> were greater than the make torques for both muscle groups. These findings indicate that when using myometry, break tests measure maximum torque more accurately than make tests, and that isometric dynamometry is preferable to myometry when testing maximum strength of large muscles of near normal strength...|$|R

Melosh and Dzurisin have pointed out the similarity between this predicted tectonic pattern and that observed on Mercury, and they have proposed that the global system of lineaments and arcuate scarps, which is well developed in the Discovery quadrangle, formed in response to early, simultaneous planetary contraction and tidal despinning.|$|R

A single cylinder, four-stroke diesel engine was modified for the present work and was operated at different engine loads and speeds. The experimental results reveal that the mixtures of CNG and diesel fuel provided better engine performance and improved the emission characteristics compared with the pure diesel fuel. For the ANN modelling, the standard back-propagation algorithm was found to be the optimum choice for training the model. A multi-layer perception network was used for non-linear mapping between the input and output parameters.

40|$|In a {{synchronous}} machine, radial, tangential, and {{axial forces}} are generated. In this thesis, three different technologies {{to control them}} are proposed. The first one, involves the utilization of the radial forces that arise between the rotor and the stator. This is achieved by segmenting the rotor field winding into groups of poles and controlling their corresponding magnetization individually. This technology is particularly useful to achieve magnetic balance and to create controllable radial forces. The second technology, involves {{the control of the}} rotor field in order to influence the tangential forces that produce torque. This is achieved by inverting the rotor field winding polarity with respect to the stator field. With this technique, <b>breaking</b> and accelerating <b>torques</b> can be created. It is particularly useful to start a synchronous machine. Finally, the application of axial forces with a magnetic thrust bearing is discussed. The main benefits of this technology are higher efficiency and increased reliability.

40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} strong {{magnetic}} fields on the columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET) {{have been investigated}} experimentally. Six alloys have been directionally solidified at low growth speeds (1 - 10 mu m s(- 1)) under magnetic fields up to 10 T. Experimental {{results show that the}} application of a strong magnetic field causes a dendrite fragmentation and then the CET. The thermoelectric magnetic force acting on cells/dendrites and equiaxed grains in the mushy zone has been studied numerically. Numerical results reveal that the value of the thermoelectric magnetic force increases as the magnetic field intensity and the temperature gradient increase. A torque is created on cells/dendrites and equiaxed grains. This <b>torque</b> <b>breaks</b> cells/dendrites and drives the rotation of equiaxed grains. The rotation of equiaxed grains in the mushy zone will further destroy cells/dendrites. Thus, with the increase of the magnetic field intensity and the temperature gradient, the volume fraction of equiaxed grains in front of columnar dendrites increases. When the magnetic field intensity and the temperature gradient reach a critical value, the growth of columnar dendrites is blocked and the CET then occurs. The present work may initiate a new method of inducing the CET via an applied strong magnetic field during directional solidification. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Flaring {{activity}} following gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), {{observed in}} both {{long and short}} GRBs, signals a long-term activity of the central engine. However, its production mechanism has remained elusive. Here we develop a quantitative model of the idea proposed by Perna et al. of a disc whose outer regions fragment due to the onset of gravitational instability. The self-gravitating clumps migrate through the disc and begin to evolve viscously when tidal and shearing <b>torques</b> <b>break</b> them apart. Our model consists of two ingredients: theoretical bolometric flare lightcurves whose shape (width, skewness) is largely insensitive to the model parameters, and a spectral correction to match the bandpass of the available observations, that is calibrated using the observed spectra of the flares. This simple model reproduces, with excellent agreement, the empirical statistical properties of the flares as measured by their width-to-arrival time ratio and skewness (ratio between decay and rise time). We present model fits to the observed lightcurves of two well-monitored flares, of GRB 060418 and of GRB 060904 B. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first quantitative model able to reproduce the flare lightcurves and explain their global statistical properties.
