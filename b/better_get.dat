500|$|Raymond Benson {{considered}} the most obvious theme of the series to be good versus evil.

500|$|It took Senior Manager of Voice and Audio Darragh O'Farrell {{four months}} to cast The Force Unleashed. ILM's face- and motion-capture [...] "CloneCam" [...] {{technology}} recorded actors' voice and physical performances.

Actors performed their lines together, rather than in isolation, to <b>better</b> <b>get</b> the sense of their characters interacting with each other. Consequently, the script's dialogue was reduced while reliance on characters' expressions— captured through the CloneCam— increased.

When they determined {{that no one was}} in the house, they salvaged what furniture they could before the fire spread into the living room. Bush discovered dynamite in the corner; he picked up an armful of explosives and handed it to one of the men.

500|$|As with Ladenson's {{observation}} that Bond was being depicted as [...] "the worthy knight", Raymond Benson also identifies the Saint George theme in Goldfinger, {{which he says}} has run in all the novels, but is finally stated explicitly in the book as part of Bond's thoughts after Goldfinger reveals he will use an atomic device to open the vault: [...] "Bond sighed wearily. Once more into the breach, dear friend! This time it really was St George and the dragon. And St. George had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> a move on and do something".

500|$|At school (not {{identified}} {{but generally}} recognised as Eton), Widmerpool is undistinguished academically and athletically, a [...] "gauche striver" [...] {{in the words}} of one literary commentator.

Driven by ambition, instead of going on to university ("much <b>better</b> <b>get</b> down to work right away") he is articled to a firm of solicitors, declaring this to be a springboard to wider horizons in business and politics. When Jenkins encounters him a few years after school, Widmerpool has achieved some social success and is a regular invitee at dinner-dances. He has also acquired a commission as a lieutenant in the Territorial Army.|$|E
500|$|Hearing of its release, {{neighbors of}} Geisel's in Springfield were at first worried the book {{would be an}} exposé of the people there. [...] Sales were lackluster, but early reviews were glowing. [...] Clifton Fadiman wrote a one-sentence review in The New Yorker, which Geisel could still quote {{near the end of}} his life: [...] "They say it's for children, but <b>better</b> <b>get</b> a copy for {{yourself}} and marvel at the good Dr. Seuss' impossible pictures and the moral tale of the little boy who exaggerated not wisely but too well." [...] The New York Times wrote, [...] "Highly original and entertaining, Dr Seuss' picture book partakes of the better qualities of those peculiarly America institutions, the funny papers and the tall tale. It is a masterly interpretation of the mind of a child in the act of creating one of those stories with which children often amuse themselves and bolster up their self-respect." ...|$|E

[...] In mid-November, Hibbs wrote Rockwell pleading that he not scrap his third work to start over. Hibbs alleviated Rockwell's thematic concern; he explained that the illustrations only needed to address the same topic rather than be in unison. Hibbs pressured Rockwell into completing his work by warning him that the magazine {{was on the verge of}} being compelled by the government to place restrictions on four-color printing, so Rockwell had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> the work published before relegation to halftone printing.|$|E

500|$|According {{to his own}} account, he {{initially}} hid in a large bush, but decided this was too obvious, and so moved to a smaller one. A German patrol arrived, examined the original bush, and attacked it with bursts of automatic gunfire before leaving. [...] "Somebody was {{keeping an eye on}} me when I thought I'd <b>better</b> <b>get</b> out of that bush..." [...] he later told Phillippa Berlyn. The area in which he had landed was predominantly anti-German, and largely under the control of pro-Allied Italian partisans; one of these saw Smith's descent and retrieved his parachute to stop the Germans from finding it. Smith hid for a while longer before emerging to greet a boy of about 12. The boy, Leo, knew no English; using sign language, he told Smith to sit and wait, and shortly returned with his elder brother, Lorenzo. Lorenzo proposed that Smith come to their home to eat, and Smith accepted. The boys' parents, peasant farmers named Zunino, took him in, but decided it was too risky to keep him at the house so soon after the crash, and hid him in a cave on the mountain. The next day, the Germans came to the Zuninos' house, looking for Smith. After about a week, the danger had subsided, and the Zuninos gave Smith a room in the house.|$|E
500|$|... "Variable and Full of Perturbation" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Mark Rozeman, writing for Paste, gave the episode {{a rating of}} 6.9 out of 10 and, despite enjoying several storylines, described the introduction of Tony as [...] "perhaps the biggest misstep in the show's brief history". He felt that the kiss between Tony and Felix {{was an example of}} [...] "taboo-pushing gimmickry" [...] and summarised the episode as [...] "strange experimental tangent". Slant Magazine critic Matt Brennan found the episode [...] "jumbled and strange" [...] but felt that the introduction of Tony was a [...] "delightful twist". He said that Cosima's storyline taking place at the Dyad Institute felt [...] "dry and utilitarian, as though the writers realized they <b>better</b> <b>get</b> their shit together in time to wrap things up". The A.V. Club Caroline Framke gave the episode a C– grade and criticised the [...] "chaotic script", [...] "aggressively flashy direction" [...] and the failed attempts to integrate the [...] "wildly different" [...] subplots. She admired the attempt to [...] "shin a light on a population that's often invisible in the media landscape" [...] by introducing a transgender character, but thought that Tony's character was underdeveloped and [...] "more like a prop than a character". Similarly, Adam W. Kepler of The New York Times felt that Tony was a cliché of trans men—"absolutely nothing [...] haven't seen before"—whose characterisation was overly simplistic.|$|E
500|$|By about 00:20, 40minutes {{after the}} collision, the loading of the {{lifeboats}} was under way. Second Officer Lightoller recalled afterwards that he noticed Smith {{standing near the}} bridge {{looking out at the}} ocean in a trance-like daze. According to Lightoller, [...] "I yelled {{at the top of my}} voice, 'Hadn't we <b>better</b> <b>get</b> the women and children into the boats, sir?' He heard me and nodded reply." [...] Smith then ordered Lightoller and Murdoch to [...] "put the women and children in and lower away". Lightoller took charge of the boats on the port side and Murdoch took charge of those on the starboard side. The two officers interpreted the [...] "women and children" [...] evacuation order differently; Murdoch took it to mean women and children first, while Lightoller took it to mean women and children only. Lightoller lowered lifeboats with empty seats if there were no women and children waiting to board, while Murdoch allowed a limited number of men to board if all the nearby women and children had embarked. Neither officer knew how many people could safely be carried in the boats as they were lowered and they both erred on the side of caution by not filling them. They could have been lowered quite safely with their full complement of 68 people, especially with the highly favourable weather and sea conditions. Had this been done, an extra 500 people could have been saved; instead, hundreds of people, predominantly men, were left on board as lifeboats were launched with many seats vacant.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the more}} {{important}} performances in Cooper's early career was his portrayal of a sullen legionnaire in Josef von Sternberg's 1930 film Morocco with Marlene Dietrich in her introduction to American audiences. During production, von Sternberg focused his energies on Dietrich and treated Cooper dismissively. Tensions came to a head after von Sternberg yelled directions at Cooper in German. The [...] actor approached the [...] director, physically picked him up by the collar and said, [...] "If you expect to work in this country you'd <b>better</b> <b>get</b> on to the language we use here." [...] Despite the tensions on the set, Cooper produced [...] "one of his best performances", according to Thornton Delehanty of the New York Evening Post. In 1931, after returning to the Western genre in Zane Grey's Fighting Caravans with French actress Lili Damita, Cooper appeared in the Dashiell Hammett crime film City Streets playing a westerner who gets involved with big-city gangsters in order to save the woman he loves. Cooper concluded the year with appearances in two unsuccessful films: I Take This Woman with Carole Lombard, and His Woman with Claudette Colbert. The demands and pressures of making ten films in two years left Cooper exhausted and in poor health, suffering from anemia and jaundice. He had lost [...] during that period, and felt lonely, isolated, and depressed by his sudden fame and wealth. In May 1931, Cooper left Hollywood and sailed to Algiers and then Italy, where he lived for the next year.|$|E

500|$|Early in the series, Clark {{was still}} {{learning}} how to handle his life, by learning to control his powers and find the best solution for everyone. His main priority was {{to fit in with}} his friends at school and be an average guy. Initially, Clark's biggest problem was the fact that he could not share his secret with anyone he cared about. According to Welling, [...] "He is burdened with a lot of responsibility. He hasn't been able to choose whether or not he has these abilities. All this responsibility has just been thrust on him, and he has to deal with it. There have got to be times when he goes home and thinks to himself, ‘Why me?' He wishes it could all go away and he could just be normal. That's part of the character dilemma which makes him interesting to play." [...] Welling noted that the show was not about Clark always saving the day, but more about how using his powers [...] "... alienate him from others". Welling reasoned {{that by the end of}} season three, Clark had decided that leaving Smallville and going with Jor-El was something that would save everyone a lot of pain in the long run. Welling described why Clark finally gave in to Jor-El at the end of season three:"If you can't fight them, you might as well join them [...] he was choosing the lesser of two evils to go with Jor-El. I think a combination of those two things would probably sum it up. A lot of times in your life, you get to a point where you go, 'I just can't fight this anymore. There's nothing I can do about it, so I <b>better</b> <b>get</b> up out of bed and go to work!' And in a sense, that's what Clark had to do. Somehow he had to try to face what it was that was causing him so much pain—and everyone else so much pain—and maybe he reasoned that by causing everyone else a little bit of pain, he could save them a lot of pain in the long run." ...|$|E
