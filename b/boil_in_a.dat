40|$|AbstractThe Po River (Northern Italy) is {{the longest}} {{watercourse}} in Italy and over half of its length is safeguarded by major river embankments. Their stability is crucial for the local communities, being the Po River plain densely populated. Among all possible failure mechanisms, backward erosion piping at the interface between the bottom sandy aquifer and the overlying fine-grained soils {{has proved to be}} one of the most threatened phenomena. This paper describes the reactivation of a sand <b>boil</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> river embankment section in the Province of Ferrara, during the 2014 major high-water event. Detailed stratigraphic soil profiling as well as careful geotechnical characterization of the embankment and of the subsoil have been carried out on the basis of in-situ tests. Then, safety assessment of the backward erosion piping has been performed using simplified prediction tools and a preliminary 2 D numerical model. Results are compared and discussed with the aim of providing some insight into the mechanism under investigation...|$|E
40|$|On a rainy Sunday {{morning in}} a tough Miami {{neighborhood}} in the early 1970 s, seven-year-old Carl Hart was {{at home with his}} parents and five sisters. His mother was enjoying Al Green on the record player when, on an extension phone, she accidentally overheard Hart’s father talking to a lover. After heating maple syrup to a <b>boil</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pot, his mom strode into the bedroom and heaved it at him. Hart’s father chased her outside, wearing only his Fruit of the Loom underwear. Had he not slipped on the wet grass, he may well have killed her. Instead, the incident permanently ended a marriage long fraught with conflict. No drugs were involved in this episode. Indeed, crack cocaine didn’t hit the streets until almost a decade after this occurred. And yet a national mythos has arisen whereby crack and other drugs have been repeatedly blamed for poverty, child neglect, unemployment, violence, {{and a host of other}} conditions in the African American community that often preceded the so-called crack epidemic chronologically and have less obvious causes.
