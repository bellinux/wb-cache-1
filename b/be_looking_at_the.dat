5|$|While {{portraying the}} bonds between {{the members of}} Class Zero, and between them and their summoned monsters, along with the game's themes of death and war, Naora drew {{inspiration}} from {{when he saw a}} cat killed by a car surrounded by other cats. Nomura was in charge of choosing the voice cast, which featured several well-known voice actors. When listening to the samples and picking the actors, Nomura focused on whether they could successfully project the characters' personalities. The actors and actresses helped define the characters, adding individual touches during voice recording sessions. Sayoko Hoshino acted as the game's character texture artist. Originally, she was going to put in black voids where a female character's panties would have been due to hardware limitations. However the staff realized that the players would <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> backs of characters a lot, so Hoshino designed panties for each female character and worked with the staff to incorporate them into the character models.|$|E
500|$|Flight Unlimited was a {{commercial}} success. It debuted in twelfth {{place on a}} June 1995 sales chart compiled by NPD Group, while Microsoft Flight Simulator 5.1 took first place. The game went on to sell more than 300,000 copies by 1997, and more than 780,000 by 2002. According to Constantine von Hoffman of the Boston Herald, Flight Unlimited successfully competed with Microsoft Flight Simulator. PC Gamers Lee Buchanan wrote that it [...] "soars above the pack of flight simulations", and he considered it to be [...] "the most fun [...] had in a computerized cockpit". Frank Vizard of Popular Mechanics hailed it as [...] "the new top gun of flight simulators", and Doug Bailey of The Boston Globe considered {{it to be the}} [...] "first real serious challenge to Microsoft's dominance of the genre". The Records David Noack believed that the game's physics and stereoscopic terrain set [...] "a new standard in flight simulation". Writing for Computer Gaming World, Bob and John Nolan stated, [...] "If anything, you should at least {{take a look at this}} product, because you'll <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> future of simulations." ...|$|E

[...] Another avenue would <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> nutrition content {{which is also}} seen {{to be responsible for}} mitigating the effects of Arsenic.

2500|$|A {{wide range}} of {{political}} opinion had always favoured in principle the establishment of unitary authorities. The Labour Party had planned to implement the Redcliffe-Maud Report in the 1970s, and the party's 1982 statement of policy [...] "Labour's Programme 1982" [...] said [...] "There is an irrational split of functions between the two tiers compounded by a confusing overlap of responsibilities ... We favour the creation in England and Wales of unitary authorities". Heseltine announced in 1991 {{that the government would}} <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> creation of unitary authorities in the non-metropolitan counties as part of a more general review of local government, including the abolition of the Community Charge, or poll tax.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first stage}} {{after the second}} and final rest day, the seventeenth stage was the second last to have an uphill finish of some form; on this occasion, it was a [...] long, second-category climb to Fuente Dé, but was not {{excessively}} steep at an average gradient of 3.9%. Prior to that, there were two other categorised climbs during the stage – both {{in the second half}} of the stage – with the third-category Collado de Ozalba and the second-category Collado La Hoz also on the itinerary for the stage, [...] in length. The stage was ideally suited for rouleurs and not the overall contenders, who would <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> penultimate-day stage to the summit finish at , as their only remaining attempt to gain time before the finish the next day, in Madrid.|$|E
2500|$|Cunningham {{became a}} short-list {{candidate}} for the cabinet of Governor Ed Rendell. Initial discussions centered around the secretary position for the Department of Community and Economic Development. In December 2002, Cunningham cut short his trip to a National League of Cities conference in Salt Lake City to fly to Philadelphia and discuss the post with Rendell. Cunningham and Rendell had previously met through the Pennsylvania League of Cities and Municipalities, {{near the end of}} Rendell's tenure as mayor of Philadelphia, and they had been friends since. Rendell said economic development of the state's urban core was one of the top issues of his administration, and that he had [...] "tremendous respect" [...] for Cunningham and his accomplishments in Bethlehem. Likewise, Cunningham said he had modeled his administration's economic development plan for Bethlehem in part after the prototype Rendell used as mayor of Philadelphia. In January 2003, it was announced Rendell had tapped Cunningham for a secretary position, but with the Department of General Services, not the Department of Community and Economic Development. Although Cunningham was a candidate for both posts, Rendell said his track record of success in Bethlehem despite the loss of Bethlehem Steel would serve him well in maintaining the state's costs. Rendell also said Cunningham would be in the forefront of an effort to contain spending in the state government, which was facing a $2 billion budget deficit. Rendell said of Cunningham: [...] "You might <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> only two people in Pennsylvania who know how to cut costs." ...|$|E
