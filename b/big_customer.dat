5000|$|Two types: Government-owned {{companies}}, which legally {{are normal}} companies but mainly or fully national owned. They {{are expected to}} be funded by their sales. A <b>big</b> <b>customer</b> might be the government or a government agency. The other type is Government agencies which might also do activities competing with private owned companies. They usually are funded by tax money but can also sell services. The government has tried to avoid having agencies doing commercial activities, by separating out areas that compete with private companies into government-owned companies, for example within road construction. The reason is both to avoid unfair competition, and a wish to have market economy instead of plan economy as much as possible. Based on the tradition of avoiding [...] "ministerial rule", the government has avoided interfering with the business of the companies, and allowed them to go international.|$|E

50|$|Born to a Jewish family, Tuchman worked various {{jobs as a}} teenager: in a surf {{shop and}} renting lots for car sales which blossomed into a {{business}} where he would answer inquiries and then set up appointments. In the 1980s, Tuchman worked for his father's luxury-home construction business in California. Often he would inquire about products advertised in magazines that might be useful in the homes his father constructed. Noting that it usually took several months for a response (and often well after the house had begun construction), {{the idea of a}} business that would serve as a centralized base for potential customer inquiries was germinated. In 1982, he founded Teletech in an old nursery school near Los Angeles allowing businesses to outsource their customer service requirements. His first <b>big</b> <b>customer</b> was Herbalife. In 1984, after the conglomerate AT&T was broken up, TeleTech was hired to monitor AT&T’s transactions with customers who were switching carriers which led to business with two of the resulting phone companies, MCI, Inc. and United Telecom (now Sprint Corporation), to sign up new customers.|$|E

40|$|This Bachelor Thesis {{provides}} an overview of the growing Fintech-sector and analyses banks’ reactions and impacts on the financial stability. The examined aspects include findings about differences between banks and Fintech-companies, main success factors, banks’ reaction to new market participants and consequences for the financial stability. Fintech describes the combination of innovative technology and financial services. Fintech-companies provide alternative financial services for private and corporate clients, which accelerate and simplify the access to financial resources, the investment of assets or the execution of transactions. Both Fintech-companies and banks show a high degree of willingness to cooperate, which enables to benefit from synergy effects. Fintech-companies are the innovative driver, whereas banks provide the necessary expertise and a <b>big</b> <b>customer</b> base. In 2016 banks’ venture capital subsidiaries invested 13. 6 billion in cooperation projects with Fintech-companies. From today’s perspective, there are no concrete risks, which could imply foreseeable dangers for the financial stability. However, there are risks which could destabilize the financial system in the long-term, if the growth of the Fintech-sector continues steadily. At the same time, innovation in financial technology could have stabilizing implications for the financial system, because of higher efficiency, decentralisation, diversification and transparency...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- In {{dealing with}} the {{production}} of various products in some industries, many firms need to respond to wide ranges of quantities demanded. High responsiveness to wider ranges of quantities can be a competitive advantage for a firm in modern highly competing environments. To stay ahead of competitors, a firm {{should be able to}} schedule production in an efficient way. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the effects of wide ranges of quantities demanded on the scheduling. The production scheduling problem of knitted fabrics is used to examine the influences. Genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to be the analytical tool. Optimal parameters including mutation rates and crossover rates that generate good performance are obtained experimentally. Results from this paper show that the makespan in wide ranges of quantities is lower than that in a small range. However, the machine utilization in wide ranges of quantities is lower than that in a small range. To schedule the production with a lower makespan and with reasonable machine utilization, one can divide a <b>big</b> <b>customer</b> order into many manufacturing orders with smaller quantities. In addition, the on-time delivery rate can be increased by adding a penalty factor of completion time of a job. Key-Words:- Genetic algorithm, knitted fabric, production scheduling, responsiveness, wide ranges of quantities...|$|E
40|$|Title: Globalization – Meeting a {{new market}} Author: Anna Nubäck Supervisor: Anders Nilsson Institution: School of Management, Blekinge Tekniska Högskola Course: Master in {{business}} administration, 15 credits (FED 006) Purpose: The purpose of this essay is partly to create {{an understanding of the}} decision to establish a branch in Japan and especially to look at if and how the Swedish company in this study has adjusted its corporate culture to suit the Japanese market. Method: Data is collected thru a number of semi constructed interviews. A first telephone interview was followed by an interview made face to face that was also followed up by interviews performed over telephone. E-mails have been used to clear and correct collected data. I have also studied company reports, closely related literature, articles and papers on the Internet. Conclusion: My conclusion is that the company in this study based the decision to open a branch in Japan on the demand from one <b>big</b> <b>customer</b> and the potential to grow globally. The company branch located in Tokyo has with or without the awareness of it adjusted to the Japanese market and culture. The company decision to choose a “local” for the most important position together with the decision to place a Swede with a good knowledge of the Japanese customer and culture in the second most important position has given the company a good base for the cultural adjustment.

40|$|Introduction: In the Northern {{region of}} the Northern Province, there is an {{increase}} in the number of small-scale and semi-commercial farms in all sectors of agriculture. This includes the production of grains, vegetables, fruits and livestock. Broiler production seemed to be a much-preferred alternative of development in community based projects and emerging farmers have shown keen interest. This is because broiler production requires less space than ruminants and is ready for human consumption within a very short period of time. Poultry production provides a constant source of income and protein with a <b>big</b> <b>customer</b> demand. By the year 2000, broiler production is expected to reach 4000 million and 7. 5 million tons of poultry feeds in the world. Many countries have initiated programs aimed at improving small-scale poultry as a means of helping to bring socio- economic benefits to rural communities (Panda, 1989). In order to feed the ever rising population of 4. 9 million in the Northern Province (1996 Census), there must be an increase in the production of broilers as a primary source of top quality animal protein. With the high unemployment rate (46 %) in the Northern Province, self- employment projects are needed which comply with agro- processing. More than 90 community projects based on poultry production in the Northern {{region of the}} Northern Province had been established in order to reduce the high rate of unemployment. Today more people have engaged themselves in community projects especially in poultry production than ever before. Some of the constrains of broiler production at both small-scale and semi-commercial farming condition includes inadequate ventilation system. Lack of suitable health care facilities and frequently the absence of efficient marketing structures form part of the obstacles to the rapid development of poultry production. Feed costs which remain the highest input cost in the production of broilers represent between 60 to 70 % or more of the total costs of broiler productions (Benyi and Habi, 1998). Lack of management skills and training for small and semi-commercial farmers makes it difficult to obtain optimum performance. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of broilers as influenced by environmental factors under small...|$|E
