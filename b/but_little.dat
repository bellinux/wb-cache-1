5|$|A large wave {{breaking}} on {{the cliffs}} of Maré Island in New Caledonia swept away a spectator, who was presumed dead after the rough conditions delayed searching efforts. The storm disrupted classes and school activities {{in parts of}} the archipelago, <b>but</b> <b>little</b> to no damage was reported.|$|E
5|$|A new forward {{headquarters}}, Alsos Forward North (AFwdN), {{was opened}} at Aachen, and on 8 February the Alsos Mission reopened its forward headquarters in Strasbourg as Alsos Forward South (AFwdS). In March, the U.S. Twelfth Army Group launched Operation Lumberjack, an offensive {{to clear the}} Germans west of the Rhine. Pash, who was promoted to colonel on 6 March, led an Alsos Mission detachment into Cologne on 7 March, <b>but</b> <b>little</b> additional information was found.|$|E
5|$|As a {{developing}} tropical cyclone, the storm produced increased winds and lower pressures in the Swan Islands, {{off the coast}} of Honduras. Heavy rainfall occurred throughout Jamaica, causing street flooding and several mudslides, <b>but</b> <b>little</b> damage. No disruptions were reported to communications or railway travel. The storm brushed eastern Belize while located off the coast, producing 3.62inches (21.9mm) of rainfall and light winds.|$|E
60|$|And 'tis to {{be taken}} notice of: As the {{witnesses}} in the text were slain <b>but</b> a <b>little</b> before the ruin of Antichrist began; so this church was baptized in the sea <b>but</b> a <b>little</b> before great Pharaoh was drowned there.|$|R

5|$|Both McLuhan and Innis {{assume the}} {{centrality}} of communication technology; where they differ is in the principal kinds of effects they see deriving from this technology. Whereas Innis sees communication technology principally affecting social organization and culture, McLuhan sees its principal effect on sensory organization and thought. McLuhan has {{much to say about}} perception and thought <b>but</b> <b>little</b> to say about institutions; Innis says much about institutions and little about perception and thought.|$|E
5|$|Documents {{mention the}} {{construction}} of another bucentaur in 1449 larger than the 1311 one, <b>but</b> <b>little</b> is known about this vessel. The earliest known image of a bucentaur appeared in Jacopo de' Barbari's monumental woodcut Pianta di Venezia (Map of Venice) {{which was published in}} 1500. This work pictured a bucentaur afloat in the Arsenale without oars or decoration save for a large wooden sculpture of Justice in the bow. A similar illustration was produced by Andrea Valvassore between 1517 and 1525.|$|E
5|$|During {{the attack}} on Pearl Harbor, nine Zeros were shot down. From these wrecks, the Allies learned that the Zero lacked armor and {{self-sealing}} fuel tanks, <b>but</b> <b>little</b> else about its capabilities. The Zero's flight performance characteristics—crucial to devising tactics and machinery to combat it—remained a mystery.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Gladys {{produced}} rough seas {{that affected}} Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the northern Leeward Islands {{and the northern}} Bahamas. The outer bands of Gladys also lashed Bermuda with winds <b>but</b> <b>little</b> damage if any was reported. In Atlantic Canada, Gladys passed over Newfoundland as a 70mph (120km/h) extratropical storm but no damage was reported. At St. John's Harbor, 65ships took shelter as a precaution. Some ships suffered damage, including two foreign freighters.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Cucurbitaceae include gourds, melons, pumpkins, and squashes. Seeds {{from these}} plants are noted for their oil content, <b>but</b> <b>little</b> {{information}} is available on methods of extracting the oil. In most cases, the plants are grown as food, with dietary use of the oils as a byproduct of using the seeds as food.|$|E
5|$|Paulinus was a monk from Rome {{sent to the}} Kingdom of Kent by Pope Gregory I in 601, {{along with}} Mellitus and others, {{as part of the}} second group of missionaries sent to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity.

5|$|Smithers' {{devotion to}} Mr. Burns was {{inspired}} from how numerous Fox executives {{and staff members}} acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers' ambiguous sexual orientation came from Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, <b>but</b> <b>little</b> attention should be drawn to it. Smithers' first name (Waylon) was derived from that of puppeteer Wayland Flowers.|$|E
5|$|The 19th century saw {{improvements}} to Somerset's roads {{with the introduction}} of turnpikes, and the building of canals and railways. Nineteenth-century canals included the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, Westport Canal, Glastonbury Canal and Chard Canal. The Dorset and Somerset Canal was proposed, <b>but</b> <b>little</b> of it was ever constructed and it was abandoned in 1803.|$|E
5|$|The Rübel family {{restored}} commercial citrus {{production and}} set about repairing the earthquake damage. They successfully lobbied to have Camulos listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. In 2000, it was further designated a National Historic Landmark. Although the main house was restored in 1996, funding was not available to restore the smaller buildings until 2006, with construction completed in spring 2007.

5|$|The field {{grew from}} 19th century beginnings, where {{embryology}} faced a mystery: zoologists {{did not know}} how embryonic development was controlled at the molecular level. Charles Darwin noted that having similar embryos implied common ancestry, <b>but</b> <b>little</b> progress was made until the 1970s. Then, recombinant DNA technology at last brought embryology together with molecular genetics. A key early discovery was of homeotic genes that regulate development {{in a wide range of}} eukaryotes.|$|E
5|$|The first kingdom's {{government}} {{consisted of}} the king (styled Malikum) and the grand vizier, who headed a council of elders (Abbu) and the administration. The second kingdom was a monarchy, <b>but</b> <b>little</b> is known about it {{because of a lack}} of written records. The third kingdom was a city-state monarchy with reduced importance under the authority of Yamhad.|$|E
