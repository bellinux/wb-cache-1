Fine tuners may also be applied to the other strings, especially on a student instrument, and are sometimes built into the tailpiece. The fine tuners enable the performer to make small changes in the pitch of a string. At the scroll end, the strings wind around the wooden tuning pegs in the pegbox. The tuning pegs are tapered and fit into holes in the peg box. The tuning pegs are held in place by the friction of wood on wood. Strings may be made of metal or less commonly gut or gut wrapped in metal. Strings usually have a colored silk wrapping at both ends, for identification of the string (e.g., G string, D string, A string or E string) and to provide friction against the pegs. The tapered pegs allow friction to be increased or decreased by the player applying appropriate pressure along the axis of the peg while turning it.|$|E

The dwelling-room, the kitchen, was at the back of the house, facing inward between the blocks, looking at a scrubby back garden, and then at the ash-pits. And between the rows, between the long lines of ash-pits, went the alley, where the children played and the women gossiped and the men smoked.

40|$|There is hard {{competitive}} environment in production industry and shipyards {{have a lot}} of competitors. Under these circumstances, the process improvement operations are very signifi cant in shipbuilding industry. In recent years, shipyards have been attempting to improve their processes by investigating their current production system so that they can keep their competitive power in global extent. Shipyards seek to decrease the cycle time of the interim products in order to increase the annual production capacity and the market share of the shipyard. In order to do this, shipyards have to analyze their own production system and perform some improvements on the current production system. In this study, the process improvement model is presented. The process improvement model consists of the continuous improvement method, OPT (Optimized Production Technology), and simulation. The phases in the model were implemented for a double <b>bottom</b> <b>block</b> of a container ship. As a result, by doing some improvements on the current production system, the cycle time of the double <b>bottom</b> <b>block</b> was shortened.

40|$|A {{new type}} of sulfide-based, {{solid-state}} dye material that is sensitive to visible radiation was assessed as a potential replacement for commercial ruthenium complex dyes in a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) assembly. The In 2 S 3 crystals {{on the surface of}} the TiO 2 <b>bottom</b> <b>blocking</b> layer were grown as a solid-state dye material. Scanning electron microscopy of In 2 S 3 revealed a microsized, 3 D-connected sheet-like shape, which was confirmed by X-ray diffraction to be a beta-structure. The efficiency of the dye-sensitized solar cells assembled with a layer grown with In 2 S 3 increased with increasing In 2 S 3 mole concentrations to 0. 05 [*]M (1. 02 %) but decreased at concentrations greater than 0. 6 ~ 0. 8 %. This suggests that crystalline In 2 S 3 acts as a dye sensitized to visible radiation, but the short-circuit current density is too low compared to the commercially available ruthenium dye. This suggests that In 2 S 3 crystals did not grow densely but were bulk-grown with large pores, resulting in a smaller amount of In 2 S 3 per unit area. Two IPCE curves were observed, which were assigned to TiO 2 and In 2 S 3, meaning that the TiO 2 surfaces were covered completely with In 2 S 3 crystals. The exposure of TiO 2 eventually leads to a reaction with the electrolytes, resulting in lower quantum efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The {{understanding}} of phase behavior of copolymer brushes is of fundamental {{importance for the}} design of smart materials. In this paper, we have performed classical density functional theory calculations to study diblock copolymer brushes (A-B) in an explicit solvent which prefers the A block to B block. With increasing B-block length (NB), we find a structural transition of the copolymer brush from mixed to collapsed, partial-exposed, and exposed structure, which is qualitatively consistent with experiments. The phase transitions are attributed to the interplay between entropic cost of folding copolymer brushes and enthalpic effect of contact between unlike components. In addition, we examine the effect of different parameters, such as grafting density (ρg), the <b>bottom</b> <b>block</b> length (NA), and the chain length of solvent (NS) on the solvent response of copolymer brushes. The transition chain length (NB) increases with decreasing ρg and NA, and a smaller solvent molecule makes the collapsed structure less stable due to its lower penetration cost. Our results provide the insight to phase behavior of copolymer brushes in selective solvents from a molecular view...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the {{production}} environment, {{there are many}} disruptions, such as machine breakdown, rush orders, and so on. Under these circumstances, the shipyards have to meet customer demand. If this is not done, the shipyard may face customer loss, since they cannot meet the deadline.

As a result of the study, the critical rates of machine breakdown, which have affected system throughput, have been determined. The main contribution of the study is to allow production engineers to take measures against machine breakdowns in advance, so that target throughput can be reached...|$|E
30|$|Amphiphilic polymer {{coatings}} {{were prepared}} by first generating surface-anchored polymer layers of poly(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) {{on top of}} flat solid substrates followed by postpolymerization reaction on the hydroxyl terminus of HEMA’s pendent group using three classes of fluorinating agents, including organosilanes, acylchlorides, and trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA). The distribution of the fluorinated groups inside the polymer brushes was assessed {{by means of a}} suite of analytical probes, including contact angle, ellipsometry, infrared spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and near-edge x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. While organosilane modifiers were found to reside primarily close to the tip of the brush, acylchlorides penetrated deep inside PHEMA thus forming random copolymers P(HEMA-co-fHEMA). The reaction of TFAA with the PHEMA brush {{led to the formation of}} amphiphilic diblocks, PHEMA-b-P(HEMA-co-fHEMA), whose <b>bottom</b> <b>block</b> comprised unmodified PHEMA and the top block was made of P(HEMA-co-fHEMA) rich in the fluorinated segments. This distribution of the fluorinated groups endowed PHEMA-b-P(HEMA-co-fHEMA) with responsive properties; while in hydrophobic environment P(HEMA-co-fHEMA) segregated to the surface, when in contact with a hydrophilic medium, PHEMA partitioned at the brush surface. The surface activity of the amphiphilic coatings was tested by studying the adsorption of fibrinogen (FIB). While some FIB adsorption occurred on most coatings, the ones made by TFAA modification of PHEMA remained relatively free of FIB.|$|E
