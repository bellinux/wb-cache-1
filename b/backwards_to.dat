5|$|Architecturally, most war {{memorials}} {{were relatively}} conservative in design, aiming to use established styles {{to produce a}} tragic but comforting, noble and enduring commemoration of the war dead. Classical themes were particularly common, taking the prevailing styles of the late 19th century and typically simplifying them to produce cleaner, more abstract memorials. Allegorical and symbolic features, frequently drawing on Christian imagery, were used to communicate themes of self-sacrifice, victory and death. Some memorials adopted a medievalist theme instead, looking <b>backwards</b> <b>to</b> a more secure past, while others used emerging realist and Art Deco architectural styles to communicate the themes of the war.|$|E
5|$|Most reviews {{were very}} favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, {{although}} a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing {{has been compared to}} that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors, Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter, and the Ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought the book looked <b>backwards</b> <b>to</b> Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues.|$|E
5|$|Adamussium colbecki is a large, slow-growing scallop {{that lives}} on the seabed. The shell {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} ribbed calcareous valves which enclose the soft body and are joined by a ligament at a hinge. It feeds on microscopic green algae and is sometimes present in great numbers. It is able to move around by flapping its valves and to dart <b>backwards</b> <b>to</b> escape threats. The species is an important member of the Antarctic seabed community as the upper valve often acts as a substrate for seaweeds, sponges and other organisms. In addition, juveniles bind themselves by threads to the upper valve of older shells, using these as a base for several years as they grow. The adult scallops have been used in research to study the accumulation of heavy metals in marine organisms.|$|E

5|$|Bond veteran {{cameraman}} {{and professional}} skier Willy Bogner, Jr. {{was promoted to}} director of a second unit involving ski footage. Bogner designed the ski chase on the bobsleigh track of Cortina d'Ampezzo hoping to surpass his work in both On Her Majesty's Secret Service and The Spy Who Loved Me. To allow better filming, Bogner developed both a system where he was attached to a bobsleigh, allowing to film the vehicle or behind it, {{and a set of}} skis that allowed him to ski forwards and <b>backwards</b> <b>to</b> get the best shots. In February 1981, {{on the final day of}} filming the bobsleigh chase, one of the stuntmen driving a sleigh, 23-year-old Paolo Rigon, was killed when he became trapped under the bob.|$|E
5|$|Hunter recalls being pleasantly {{surprised}} to learn that Russ Tamblyn and Richard Beymer had been cast as regular characters in the series, having enjoyed the early work of both actors during the 1950s and 1960s. Tamblyn improvised elements of his performance, including a magic trick involving two golf balls, which was something he had learned and wished to include during his role in the episode. The character of Gordon Cole, first played by Lynch in this episode as a voice in a telephone call, was conceived as being hard of hearing; this was because Lynch liked the idea of delivering his lines in a loud voice, and worked <b>backwards</b> <b>to</b> establish a reason for this. Engels wrote most of Cole's dialogue over the series, having had experience with his own mother being similarly hard of hearing.|$|E
5|$|In Queens, New York, police chase a sedan driven {{through a}} parking garage by two men keeping a teenage boy named Tyler Carson (Cameron Monaghan) in the backseat. Police {{officers}} surround the car and draw their weapons, demanding that the men exit the car. They do, and Tyler stays in his seat. Without explanation, {{one of the officers}} walks <b>backwards</b> <b>to</b> the parking ramp and jumps to his death. Another officer shoots her two remaining co-workers, then herself. The kidnappers' crime spree continues on the road. One of them, Hickey (John Tench), demands that a convenience store clerk hand over all his cash. Another customer tries to intervene, but then takes a pot of hot coffee, pours the coffee over his own head, and beats himself with the pot. The cashier then electrocutes himself.|$|E

5|$|Magnetic Airborne Detection (MAD) {{was used}} to detect {{submerged}} U-boats. It consisted of a sensitive magnetometer installed in the cone of the aircraft (mostly Catalinas) that could detect anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field within a range of 400 feet and was sensitive to detect a submarine to within a few feet. The mine was {{used in conjunction with}} a 65.5lb retro bomb. It was filled with 25lb of Torpex and the weapon was rocket propelled <b>backwards</b> <b>to</b> the line of flight at a speed that counteracted the aircraft's forward motion. It was released rearwards from rails on the wings of the aircraft. Thus, with the aircraft's forward motion cancelled-out by the rocket motor, the device fell directly onto the target.|$|E
5|$|On {{the bottom}} of the skull, the pterygoid is about twice as wide as it is long. At the front of the pterygoid is a small {{projection}} that extends <b>backwards</b> <b>to</b> form a ridge, on either side of which is a furrow-like depression (the choanal groove) containing the choanae. In Theriosuchus, unlike Knoetschkesuchus, the choanae are embedded in a wider bowl-like depression. Additionally, in both species, the bottom surface of the pterygoid is somewhat concave. Extending forward from either side of the pterygoid is the ectopterygoid; in both species, this bone is constricted near the middle to form an hourglass-like shape, but in K. langenbergensis it is also somewhat twisted to the side. The back of the bone is very concave in both species.|$|E
5|$|Wet {{weather in}} the {{following}} two years affected playing conditions, making the cricket pitches slow-paced and difficult to bat on. With little experience of such conditions, MacLaren had a succession of failures. His technique, based at the time on playing forward at the ball, was unsuited to wet pitches {{and it was only}} late in 1889 that he made the required technical adjustments and learned to play off the back foot (i.e. stepping <b>backwards</b> <b>to</b> play a shot). During 1890, his final year at Harrow, he captained the team and had his most successful season, scoring over 500 runs at an average of 42.54. In the match against Eton at Lord's, MacLaren once more succeeded when others struggled, and he scored 76 on a difficult pitch. In his four years at Harrow, MacLaren was twice awarded the prize for the school's best batsman, and received awards for his fielding. MacLaren also played football successfully: he captained his House team and played in the school first eleven in 1888 and 1889 before a knee injury forced him to miss the 1890 season. Unlike many of his fellow amateur cricketers in this period, MacLaren did not attend Oxford or Cambridge Universities, where he would have played a high level of cricket; his father could not afford to send him or his brothers there. On leaving Harrow, MacLaren found employment with the Manchester and Liverpool District Bank.|$|E

5|$|Shark {{eyes are}} similar to the eyes of other vertebrates, {{including}} similar lenses, corneas and retinas, though their eyesight is well adapted to the marine environment {{with the help of a}} tissue called tapetum lucidum. This tissue is behind the retina and reflects light back to it, thereby increasing visibility in the dark waters. The effectiveness of the tissue varies, with some sharks having stronger nocturnal adaptations. Many sharks can contract and dilate their pupils, like humans, something no teleost fish can do. Sharks have eyelids, but they do not blink because the surrounding water cleans their eyes. To protect their eyes some species have nictitating membranes. This membrane covers the eyes while hunting and when the shark is being attacked. However, some species, including the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), do not have this membrane, but instead roll their eyes <b>backwards</b> <b>to</b> protect them when striking prey. The importance of sight in shark hunting behavior is debated. Some believe that electro- and chemoreception are more significant, while others point to the nictating membrane as evidence that sight is important. Presumably, the shark would not protect its eyes were they unimportant. The use of sight probably varies with species and water conditions. The shark's field of vision can swap between monocular and stereoscopic at any time. A micro-spectrophotometry study of 17 species of shark found 10 had only rod photoreceptors and no cone cells in their retinas giving them good night vision while making them colorblind. The remaining seven species had in addition to rods a single type of cone photoreceptor sensitive to green and, seeing only in shades of grey and green, are believed to be effectively colorblind. The study indicates that an object's contrast against the background, rather than colour, may be more important for object detection.|$|E
