5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really what you think or do, just think <b>by</b> <b>yourself,</b> and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E

500|$|Hull was {{remembered by}} his comrades as an {{exceptional}} pilot and an affable, jovial personality. Jimmy Beedle, in his 1966 history of No.43 Squadron, called Hull {{one of its}} all-time great characters, citing him as {{a major factor in}} the squadron's [...] "high standard of flying and... outstanding squadron spirit". John Simpson, who joined the unit as a pilot officer two months after Hull, recalled finding [...] "a confidence when flying with Caesar that was wholly lacking otherwise." [...] "I have never seen anyone who could throw a fighter about with so much confidence as old Caesar," [...] said another pilot, quoted by Beedle. [...] "Nobody gave me so much confidence to have a lead from, nobody gave me so much exhilaration and fun. Following Caesar you found yourself getting more out of your machine than you had ever imagined was possible, doing things that done <b>by</b> <b>yourself</b> would have made your hair stand on end." ...|$|E
500|$|Kelly {{understands that}} co-writing with other songwriters lends power to his songs. [...] "You often write songs with {{collaborators}} {{that you would}} never write <b>by</b> <b>yourself.</b> It's a way of dragging a song out of you that you wouldn't have come up with". One of his collaborators, Linda Bull, described Kelly's process: they would start with a simple chat. [...] "We'd just chuck ideas around and he'd pick the best bits. He'd take all the bluntness and crudeness {{out of it and}} make it beautiful; that's his magic ... It's conversations that you have [...] ". Forster summarised his 2009 review of Kelly's compilation, Songs from the South, with [...] " [...] sound easy and approachable ... Then you think: If the songs are so simple and the ideas behind them so clear, why aren't more people writing like Paul Kelly and sounding as good as he does?" [...] In 2010 Carmody and Kelly's [...] "From Little Things Big Things Grow" [...] was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia Registry.|$|E

[...] Preceded by a brief exchange between Esmeralda and the Archdeacon, the latter ultimately suggests that Esmeralda approach God for help, explaining, [...] "You can't right all the wrongs of this world <b>by</b> <b>yourself,</b> perhaps there's someone in here who can." [...] During the [...] "heartwarming" [...] musical sequence, Esmeralda [...] "pray selflessly {{on behalf of the}} world's outcasts." [...] "illed with religious imagery," [...] the song [...] "sum up everything that [...] stands for". Meanwhile, an earnest Quasimodo, enamored with Esmeralda's beauty and sincerity, hides in the bell tower, [...] "overhearing her prayer" [...] and [...] "being drawn down to her." ...|$|E

500|$|Lavigne's {{feature film}} debut was voicing an {{animated}} {{character in the}} 2006 film Over the Hedge, based on the comic strip of the same name. She voiced the character Heather, a Virginia opossum. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, [...] "All the actors went in individually, and [...] Tim and [...] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in <b>by</b> <b>yourself,</b> with {{no one else to}} kind of feed off of." [...] Lavigne found the recording process to be [...] "easy" [...] and [...] "natural", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. [...] "I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still." [...] Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. [...] " [...] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude". The film opened on 19 May 2006, making $38million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|The {{record was}} {{produced}} by Vives under the executive production of his wife, Claudia Elena Vasquez. The recording of Pombo Musical took two years in four music studios in Colombia. The album comprises songs {{from a variety of}} Colombian folk genres like vallenato, bambuco, joropo and cumbia. Some songs mix genres such as Latin pop and pop rock. Opening track, [...] "El Modelo Alfabético" [...] ("The Model Alphabetical"), is a rock-stylized cumbia and vallenato song performed by Vives, the Dúo Huellas, Eduardo Arias and Karl Troller, about being a real gentleman, such as having good manners, and also teaches the alphabet to children. [...] "El Renacuajo Paseador" [...] ("The Tadpole Walker"), is a bambuco song performed by Andrea Echeverri, Lucia Pulido, Iván Benavides, Carlos Ivan Medina, Bernardo Velasco, Ernesto Ocampo, Dúo Huellas, Fundación Batuta Chorus, and Vives. It tells the story about a tadpole named [...] "Rin Rin", that left his home without the approval of his mother [...] "Rana" [...] ("Frog"), and subsequently dies when he hides in the mouth of a duck. In this song, Echeverri added additional lines to it. Juanes performs on [...] "El Gato Bandido" [...] ("The Bandit Cat"), a pop rock song about a cat that rebels against his family and leaves home, discovering that things are not easy <b>by</b> <b>yourself,</b> and returns feeling repentant. Aterciopelados performs on [...] "Mirringa Mirronga", which is about a feline mega-party.|$|E

He has also acquired the fan nickname [...] "Jimo Dashen," [...] which translates to [...] "The Lonely Master" [...] or [...] "The Lonely God" [...] in Chinese. Fredette commented on this during an interview: “It’s not necessarily the same sense that you think about being lonely. In America, you just think you are <b>by</b> <b>yourself</b> and depressed and that type of stuff. But in this way, it more means that you're on top, and nobody is around you.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Sain {{considered}} Atrocious Virgin to {{be among}} his best work, referring to it on the Trance to the Sun Bandcamp website as their [...] "gothic-psychedelia magnum opus". In 2002, he commented on the experience: [...] "In the studio, {{it would take me}} typically 3 weeks to finish a Trance To The Sun song; and in that 3 week period I would spend anywhere from 80 to 180 hours. I kind of logged my studio time. To do that kind of studio work <b>by</b> <b>yourself,</b> you have to take careful notes. And on the last Trance To The Sun album there's a song called [...] "Map of the Lost" [...] which set the all time record at 180 hours. [...] "Map of The Lost" [...] {{is one of the greatest}} pieces I've ever come up with. The reason it took so long is because it went through several mutilations before reaching a final stage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Simeona's {{version is}} {{influenced}} by her Christian (Protestant and Catholic) education and her philosophical studies about India, China and Edgar Cayce. Like Hawaiian tradition she emphasizes prayer, confession, repentance, and mutual restitution and forgiveness. Unlike Hawaiian tradition, she describes problems only as the effects of negative karma, saying that [...] "you have to experience <b>by</b> <b>yourself</b> {{what you have done}} to others." [...] But that you are the creator of your life circumstances was common knowledge for the people of old as [...] "things we had brought with us from other lifetimes." [...] Any wrongdoing is memorized within oneself and mirrored in every entity and object which was present when the cause happened. As the Law of Cause and Effect predominates in all of life and lifetimes, the purpose of her version is mainly [...] "to release unhappy, negative experiences in past reincarnations, and to resolve and remove traumas from the 'memory banks'." [...] Karmic bondages hinder the evolution of mind, so that [...] "(karmic) cleansing is a requisite for the expansion of awareness". Using her 14-step-process would dissolve those bondages. She did not use mantras or conditioning exercises.|$|E

2500|$|In early 1808 Spear was {{transferred}} to take command of the sloop HMS Goree, aboard which he continued in the West Indies. While lying at anchor off Marie-Galante on 22 April 1808, two brigs were spotted sailing northwards. Spear determined that they were enemies after they made no response to his private signal, and set off in pursuit. The two brigs, mounting 16 guns each and so constituting the superior force, hauled up and fired on Goree, badly damaging her sails and rigging, and disabling her. They were then forced to flee when another British ship, the 14-gun [...] arrived on the scene. Goree had one man killed and four wounded in the brief engagement, while the two brigs had combined losses of eight killed and twenty-one wounded. The brigs were later discovered to be the French Pylade and Palinure. The Palinure was later captured, causing Sir Alexander Cochrane to write in his report [...] "the last of the two [...] which were so gallantly beaten by His Majesty's sloop Goree." [...] On his return to Marie-Galante Spear came ashore to be received by the entire garrison drawn up presenting arms, drums playing a march and fifes playing Rule, Britannia!. Cochrane wrote a personal letter to Spear saying [...] "I am sorry that the spirit and gallantry displayed <b>by</b> <b>yourself,</b> officers, and crew, did not meet with the success which you all so evidently deserved". Though the action was unsuccessful and therefore not gazetted, the Admiralty acknowledged Spear's deed by confirming the appointment of his acting second-lieutenant Thomas Clack.|$|E
