25|$|After Pluto's discovery, American {{astronomer}} Clyde Tombaugh continued {{searching for}} some years for similar objects, but found none. For a long time, no one searched for other TNOs as it was generally believed that Pluto, which up to August 2006 was classified a planet, was the only major object beyond Neptune. Only after the 1992 discovery of a second TNO, , did systematic searches for further such objects begin. A <b>broad</b> <b>strip</b> of the sky around the ecliptic was photographed and digitally evaluated for slowly moving objects. Hundreds of TNOs were found, with diameters {{in the range of}} 50 to 2,500 kilometers.|$|E
25|$|In view {{of these}} intentions, various {{proposals}} to establish permanent German {{possession of the}} entire Danubian waterway were formulated by the Nazis. One of these proposed the settlement of all the ethnic Germans in Southeastern Europe along a <b>broad</b> <b>strip</b> of territory {{on both sides of}} the river, stretching from Mohács in southern Hungary all the way to the Black Sea. Another suggested turning Belgrade into a fortress-city of the Reich (Reichsfestung) and the center of a Reichsgau (administrative subdivision), to be named Prinz-Eugen. Neither of these ideas was officially endorsed by the wartime German government, however, and the historical record indicates that the Nazis had no clear conception as to what extent Germany should control the Danube or how this control was to be effected. Hitler's own preference, at least for the immediate future, was the retention of a number of satellite states (Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and others) closely tied to the Nazi regime politically and economically. Serbia at the very least was most likely to remain under some permanent form of German administration.|$|E
2500|$|Hood or Parka hood (nacaq, uqurrsuk in Yup'ik, nacar in Cup'ig) is {{a common}} hat on the parka. The Greenlandic Inuit (Kalaallit, Tunumiit, and Inughuit), the Canadian Inuit, and the Alaskan Iñupiat and Yup’ik usually wear a parka style which has an {{attached}} hood with a fur ruff to protect the face. These hoods are usually trimmed with an Arctic fox tail, or a <b>broad</b> <b>strip</b> of wolf or wolverine fur. The tengqucuk is a tip of parka hood; the kak’acuk is a pompon on tip of parka hood or hat; the kakauyaq is a decoration at the crown of {{the hood of a}} young woman’s traditional Yup’ik parka that consists of strands of red, black, and, white beads or strips of calfskin; the menglairun is a strip of fur between the ruff and hood of a parka. The formation of the Eskimo Nebula resembles a person's head surrounded by a parka hood. The emperor goose's Yup’ik name nacaullek literally means [...] "one having a parka hood".|$|E

2500|$|Green {{developed}} a uniform Arts and Crafts style for the ground level station buildings, adapted {{to suit the}} individual station location. They were constructed as two-storey buildings with a structural steel frame – then {{a new form of}} construction recently imported from the United States – providing the large internal spaces needed for ticket halls and lift shafts (the first escalators were introduced in 1911). [...] The exterior elevations were clad in non-loadbearing ox-blood red (sang de boeuf) glazed terracotta (faïence) blocks, provided by the Leeds Fireclay Company. [...] The ground floor was divided into wide bays by columns, allowing separate entrances and exits, and also providing space for retail outlets. [...] The design also featured large semi-circular windows at first floor level (occasionally with circular occuli) and a heavy dentilated cornice above. [...] A <b>broad</b> <b>strip</b> between the two floors announced the name of the station in capital letters. [...] The station buildings were constructed with flat roofs with the deliberate aim of encouraging commercial office development above, another benefit of the load-bearing structural steel frame.|$|E
2500|$|Pickering is {{situated}} at the junction of the A170, which links Scarborough with Thirsk, and the A169 linking Malton and Whitby. It occupies a <b>broad</b> <b>strip</b> of land between the Ings and Low Carrs {{to the south of}} the main road and a ridge of higher, sloping ground which is surmounted by the castle to the north. It is sited where the older limestone and sandstone rocks of the North York Moors meet the glacial deposits of the Vale of Pickering. The limestone rocks form the hill on which the higher parts of the town and the castle are situated. Pickering Beck is a [...] watercourse that runs north to south through the centre of the town. It rises on the moors and drains southwards through Newton Dale before reaching Pickering. It is prone to flooding at times of exceptional rainfall when areas of town close to the beck become flooded. The town centre lies east of the beck, though the population is almost equally divided between its east and west wards. Pickering has developed around the old Market Place but the majority of houses are now in the residential estates off the main A170 road.|$|E

50|$|Soumaks {{tend to be}} finely woven, and {{although}} not as durable as piled carpets, they are stronger than kilims. The soumak wrapping often covers the whole surface of a bag or rug, but it can equally be applied in decorative strips, contrasting with the plainer and thinner flatweave areas. For example, camel bags from Malatya in Eastern Turkey could be woven in simple flatweave stripes of red and blue, with <b>broad</b> <b>strips</b> of soumak weft-wrapping with motifs for fertility and protection.|$|R
60|$|The {{old woman}} herself, {{who seemed to}} be {{relieved}} that her proposition was not favourably received, began to obey her son's directions by throwing a gay-coloured handkerchief over her head, and tying it under her chin. She then fastened her moccasins more securely on her feet, wrapped a woollen kerchief round her shoulders, and drew a large green blanket around her, strapping it to her person by means of a <b>broad</b> <b>strip</b> of deerskin. Having made these simple preparations for whatever journey lay before her, she warmed her withered old hands over the embers of the wood fire, and awaited her son's pleasure.|$|E
60|$|After {{crossing}} the Malakand Pass the first {{turning to the}} right leads to the Swat Valley. The traveller is now within the mountains. In every direction the view is restricted or terminated by walls of rock. The valley itself is broad, level and fertile. The river flows swiftly through the middle. On either side of it, is a <b>broad</b> <b>strip</b> of rice fields. Other crops occupy the drier ground. Numerous villages, some of which contain large populations, are scattered about. It is a beautiful scene. The cool breezes of the mountains temper {{the heat of the}} sun. The abundant rains preserve the verdure of the earth.|$|E

To the left of us there was the long uninterrupted shoal, {{and to the right}} a high, steep bank heavily overgrown with bushes. Above the bush the trees stood in serried ranks. The twigs overhung the current thickly, and from distance to distance a large limb of some tree projected rigidly over the stream. It was then well on in the afternoon, the face of the forest was gloomy, and a <b>broad</b> <b>strip</b> of shadow had already fallen on the water. In this shadow we steamed up--very slowly, as you may imagine. I sheered her well inshore--the water being deepest near the bank, as the sounding-pole informed me.|$|E

50|$|The natural {{concomitant}} of {{the improved}} crop rotation was land consolidation. On wholly consolidated farms (khutory and otruby) multi-course systems had largely superseded the three-course one. But, after the Revolution, such farms had largely been broken up outside their established areas. The new regime generally favoured partial consolidation into broadened strips, which was less individualistic, {{and this was}} the form that consolidation usually took. Multi-course rotations were usually established on consolidated land, and the two were usually inaugurated simultaneously. A certain amount of strip-consolidation was necessary in such circumstances to prevent multiplication of strips (if a mir changed from a three-course to a six-course rotation, for example, the number of strips per household would have otherwise doubled). Broad-strip consolidation also addressed the problems of over-narrow strips and, in large communities, of the amount of travelling from strip to strip. In the advanced region of Moscow province, 32.1% of peasant households had improved open-field (i.e. broadened-strip) tenure in 1917. In 1925 almost 7.5% of miry in the USSR had <b>broad</b> <b>strips.</b> Further progress was made in the later 1920s. In the lead was the North Caucasus, in which 19.4% of the agricultural area had been converted to <b>broad</b> <b>strips</b> by the end of 1927, and 21.9% in 1928.|$|R
50|$|The Roman administrators {{will have}} {{dissected}} the local woodland further by clearing <b>broad</b> <b>strips</b> {{each side of}} their new roads, one westward from Bourne, running {{to the south of}} Bourne Wood; the second, north-east of the wood on the line from Bourne to Ancaster. The north-eastern extremity of the modern wood lies on this road verge so will be secondary woodland (Grid Ref.TF078233). A good deal of timber from Bourne Wood will have gone into heating the pottery kilns of Roman Bourne and into charcoal for the forges, kitchens and genteel domestic heating.|$|R
60|$|The prairie {{was bright}} with sunshine, and the boisterous west wind {{was cut off}} by a bluff where Harding sat amid a litter of {{dismantled}} machinery. Behind him the newly opened birch leaves showed specks of glowing green, and a jack-rabbit, which had put off its winter coat and was now dappled white and gray, fed quietly, with a watchful eye turned toward the unconscious man; in front, the vast sweep of grass that flashed with a silvery gleam as it bowed to the wind was broken by the warm chocolate hue of a <b>broad</b> <b>strip</b> of plowing. The rows of clods, with their polished faces, stretched across the foreground; and on their outer edge Devine, dressed in overalls {{the color of the}} soil, drove a team of big, red oxen.|$|E
60|$|The two {{succeeding}} {{days were}} fine, {{and at night}} we reached the island of Quinchao. This neighbourhood is the most cultivated part of the Archipelago; for a <b>broad</b> <b>strip</b> of land {{on the coast of}} the main island, as well as on many of the smaller adjoining ones, is almost completely cleared. Some of the farmhouses seemed very comfortable. I was curious to ascertain how rich any of these people might be, but Mr. Douglas says that no one can be considered as possessing a regular income. One of the richest landowners might possibly accumulate, in a long industrious life, as much as 1000 pounds sterling; but should this happen, it would all be stowed away in some secret corner, for it is the custom of almost every family to have a jar or treasure-chest buried in the ground.|$|E
60|$|Harold {{crossed the}} island and saw that what Peter said was correct. A <b>broad</b> <b>strip</b> of black water {{stretched}} away in the darkness toward the shore. The whole ice-sheet was moving bodily before the wind, and as the island stood up in its course the ice to windward of it was forced up over it, while under its lee the lake was clear. Not a moment was lost. The canoe was got out, carried over the rocks, and carefully lowered into the water under shelter of the island. All the stores and provisions were lowered into it. A deerskin was spread on the bottom, and the girls, having been helped down into the boat, were told to lie down and were then covered with blankets. The men wrapped themselves up in skins and blankets and took their places in the canoe, the four Indians taking paddles.|$|E

[...] "You see I have not as much as a dagger." [...] Then he tore off two <b>broad</b> <b>strips</b> {{from the edge of the}} garment and twisted them into ropes, forming a running noose in each, threw the cloak, which was composed of the stout cloth used by the common people, over his arm, and signed to the attendants at the cage to open the door.|$|R
5000|$|The {{beech scale}} insect, Cryptococcus fagisuga, is {{invasive}} to North America and is host-specific, feeding exclusively on beech trees. [...] It {{can be observed}} on the trunk and limbs of the tree as woolly, white tufts that will later develop into <b>broad</b> <b>strips.</b> The woolly, white tufts and <b>broad</b> <b>strips</b> are the colonies of the beech scale insect that are formed in tiny crevices along the bark. An adult beech scale insect has a soft body, is yellow in color, ranges from 0.5 to 1.0 millimeter long, and has an elliptical shape. [...] The beech scale insect also has a stylet that it uses to penetrate the bark of the tree for feeding purposes. There are no male beech scale insects and the female insects reproduce parthenogenetically. [...] In mid to late summer, the beech scale insect lays its eggs and dies. The eggs are pale yellow and are laid on the bark in strings of four to eight eggs. [...] The first-stage nymphs begin to hatch in late summer and eggs will continue until early winter. [...] They have short antennae and legs, and move around until they find a suitable and safe place {{to settle down and}} force their stylet into the bark to begin feeding. At this point, they begin to secrete the woolly wax cover that they use for protection. This is the second stage of their life cycle and when the spring season arrives they molt again and become adult females. A second type of scale insect, Xylococcus betulae, which is non-host-specific, is native to North America and causes beech bark disease to a lesser degree than Cryptococcus fagisuga.|$|R

[...] I {{followed}} her; she opened the sash, and leaning out I saw in full the enclosed demesne which had hitherto been to me an unknown region. It was a long, not very <b>broad</b> <b>strip</b> of cultured ground, with an alley bordered by enormous old fruit trees down the middle; there was a sort of lawn, a parterre of rose-trees, some flower-borders, and, on the far side, a thickly planted copse of lilacs, laburnums, and acacias. It looked pleasant, to me--very pleasant, so long a time had elapsed since I had seen a garden of any sort. But it was not only on Mdlle. Reuter's garden that my eyes dwelt; when I had taken a view of her well-trimmed beds and budding shrubberies, I allowed my glance to come back to herself, nor did I hastily withdraw it.|$|E
60|$|A good-sized table {{stood in}} the middle of the floor, bearing, upon a <b>broad</b> <b>strip</b> of {{embroidered}} white napery, sparkling crystal and silver, vessels of wine and platters of early fruits. About it sat a very noble company of some half-dozen men and two very resplendent women. One of these was slight and little, very dark and vivacious with eyes full of a malicious humour. The other, of very noble proportions, of a fine, willowy height, with coiled ropes of hair of a colour such as I had never dreamed could be found upon human being. It was ruddy and glowed like metal. Her face and neck--and of the latter there was a very considerable display--were of the warm pale tint of old ivory. She had large, low-lidded eyes, which lent her face a languid air. Her brow was low and broad, and her lips of a most startling red against the pallor of the rest.|$|E
60|$|Breakfast was hurried. The {{weather was}} {{favorable}} for work, {{and they could}} not expect it to continue so. In an hour the sloop had been warped close to the wreck and Jimmy put on the diving dress. He was surprised to feel the half-instinctive repugnance from going down which {{he thought he had}} got rid of; but this could not be allowed to influence him, and he resolutely descended the ladder. In a few minutes he reached the wreck, and found one bilge deeply embedded; but the opposite side was lifted up, and a <b>broad</b> <b>strip</b> of planking had been torn away. Jimmy could see some distance into the interior, and his lamp showed that the stream had washed out part of the sand which had barred their way to the bulkhead cutting off the strong-room. This had been strained by the working of the wreck, and it seemed possible to wrench the beams loose.|$|E
60|$|Leaving the thumbless archer and his brood, the wayfarers struck {{through the}} {{scattered}} huts of Emery Down, and out {{on to the}} broad rolling heath covered deep in ferns and in heather, where droves of the half-wild black forest pigs were rooting about amongst the hillocks. The woods about this point fall away {{to the left and}} the right, while the road curves upwards and the wind sweeps keenly over the swelling uplands. The <b>broad</b> <b>strips</b> of bracken glowed red and yellow against the black peaty soil, and a queenly doe who grazed among them turned her white front and her great questioning eyes towards the wayfarers. Alleyne gazed in admiration at the supple beauty of the creature; but the archer's fingers played with his quiver, and his eyes glistened with the fell instinct which urges a man to slaughter.|$|R

50|$|The {{house was}} {{constructed}} by Hastings in 1844 {{adjacent to the}} home of poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (now the Longfellow House-Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site). The house consists of two main dwelling stories topped by a hip roof that has a central monitor providing a partial third floor space. The building is in a T shape, with a rear section that extends one bay beyond the sides of the main front block. It has <b>broad</b> <b>stripped</b> pilasters at the corners, and a cornice with dentil molding. Its most prominent rchitectural feature is the rounded portico of the front facade, which is flanked by full-height windows on either side. Iron grillwork forms accent the second floor exterior, and {{the first floor of the}} portico has fluted Corinthian columns. Although the exterior of the house has been well preserved, the interior has been altered, particularly by its 20th century institutional owners.|$|R
