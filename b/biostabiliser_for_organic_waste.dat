Thus, application of the production/reproduction technology innovation for improving ruminant’s productivity in the villages needs to be supported by the availability of sufficient feed.

30|$|Developing {{countries}} in Asia generally practice two biological treatment methods <b>for</b> <b>organic</b> <b>waste</b> management, such as aerobic composting and anaerobic digestion (AD).

40|$|A {{simulation}} model, called ORWARE (<b>ORganic</b> <b>WAste</b> REsearch model), {{has been}} developed for evaluation of handling alternatives <b>for</b> <b>organic</b> <b>waste.</b> The model deals with both source separated solid <b>organic</b> <b>waste</b> and liquid <b>organic</b> <b>waste</b> i. e. wastewater. Included are transport for collection, incineration, landfilling, anaerobic digestion, composting, transportation of residuals and spreading on arable land. The model is intended for simulation of handling scenarios <b>for</b> <b>organic</b> <b>waste</b> and calculates emissions to air, water, recirculation to arable land and energy turnover. The flows in the model are described by a variable vector of 43 substances, including e. g. plant nutrients, heavy metals and some organic priority pollutants. The construction of the models for anaerobic digestion, sewage plant, sewage system and spreading of residuals included in ORWARE, are described in detail. The anaerobic digestion model is a continuous, single stage, mixed tank reactor (C. S. T. R.) operating under mesophilic conditions. The gas production {{is related to the}} retention time and the maximum degradation ratio and first order rate constant, <b>for</b> the <b>organic</b> components fat, protein and three classes of carbohydrates respectively. The combustion of the gas in a stationery engine is also included. The sewage plant model includes mechanical, biological and chemical treatment of the wastewater, and anaerobic digestion and dewatering of the sewage sludge. The separation of sludge is based on the suspended solids and water separated in the respectively treatment processes with data primarily from the plant in Uppsala. Separation of the remaining substances included in the vector is principally modelled from assumptions of the substances to be attached to the suspended solids or soluble in water.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the potential <b>for</b> recycling domestic <b>organic</b> <b>waste</b> in Hobart, {{within the context of}} the Tasmanian Solid Waste Management Policy (1994), which encompasses both home composting and centralised large scale composting. The effectiveness of the Hobart City Council's home composting program and the viability, for the Council to establish a centralised composting scheme, was examined. The study analysed the impact of state legislation and policies on waste management in Tasmania and examined the rationale <b>for</b> bioconverting <b>organic</b> <b>waste</b> into compost. The biological aspects of bioconvertion, and the various composting systems, composting technologies and the process control required for large scale composting, were investigated. A survey, to determine the community's current recycling experiences and practices <b>for</b> <b>organic</b> <b>waste</b> and to assess community support for a centralised composting scheme lwas carried out in April 1997 in the Hobart municipality. The study found anomalies, with a significant proportion of the community either excluded from, or not satisfied with, the levels of information in the Council's home composting program. The type of compost bins promoted in the Council's incentive based program were also not found to be conducive for use in all housing types. The study analysed the limitations in the Council's home composting program and proposed a number of approaches for the Hobart City Council to improve its promotional and educational strategies, and incentive based programs.

The results showed marked decrease in total nitrogen in the <b>organic</b> <b>wastes</b> which was observed as loss of nitrogen. The process of nitrification and incorporation of (NH 4) 2 SO 4 affected the pH which ranged from 5. 9 to 7. 9. The cumulative mineral nitrogen released increased with incubation periods {{and the rate of}} organic application up to 28 th day, with a maximum release of 456. 40 ppm at a rate of 61 MT/ha organic application. The release of mineral N decreased on the 56 th day with a minimum of 177. 80 ppm at a rate of 60 MT/ha of organic fertilizer only. An enriched <b>organic.</b> <b>Waste</b> soil and <b>organic</b> <b>waste</b> treated soil had a boosting effect on the release of mineral nitrogen.
