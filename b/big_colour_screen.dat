50|$|The <b>colour</b> <b>screen</b> {{plate was}} usually {{sold as a}} {{separate}} item to the panchromatic negatives. A single <b>colour</b> <b>screen</b> plate could be placed into the camera and used to expose many negatives in succession. The resultant negatives looked like standard black-and-white negatives, with a noticeable crosshatch patterning in areas of strong colour.|$|R

50|$|It was {{superseded}} by phones with <b>screens</b> with more <b>colours</b> and pixels, such as 4096, then 65K <b>colour</b> <b>screens.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{system used}} two glass plates, {{one of which}} was the <b>colour</b> <b>screen</b> plate while the other was a {{standard}} black-and-white negative plate. The <b>colour</b> <b>screen</b> plate comprised a series of red, green and blue filters, laid down in a regular pattern of lines to form a réseau, or matrix. Because the negatives of the time required long exposure times, the <b>colours</b> in the <b>screen</b> plate were diluted to let more light through to the negative, resulting in a quicker exposure. A viewing screen with more intense colour filters was used in combination with the developed positive to project a composite colour image.|$|R

25|$|Planar {{graphics}} are used, {{with up to}} 5 bitplanes (4 in hires); {{this allowed}} 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 <b>colour</b> <b>screens,</b> from a palette of 4096 colours. Two special graphics modes were also included: Extra HalfBrite, which used a 6th bitplane as a mask that halved the brightness of any colour seen, and Hold And Modify (HAM), which allowed all 4096 <b>colours</b> on <b>screen</b> at once.|$|R

50|$|In 2000, version 2.94 was {{the first}} QL {{operating}} system that broke free of the bounds of the QL 8 <b>colour</b> <b>screen,</b> introducing GD2 (Graphic Device Interface Version 2), a QL compatible 16-bit high colour graphics sub-system.|$|R
50|$|It was {{launched}} {{in conjunction with the}} Sepura Colour Console (SCC), whose large, high-resolution <b>colour</b> <b>screen</b> allowed the display of high quality photographs and maps and boasted an innovative 'night mode' to reduce glare, particularly at night.|$|R
50|$|An {{operator}} sat {{in front}} of a device that vaguely resembles today's PC, except the monitor was small, expensive (US$2,000), low-resolution (24x80) and the available colors were green and bright green. <b>Colour</b> <b>screens</b> (7 <b>colours)</b> arrived later.|$|R
50|$|The 1100 {{is similar}} to the {{discontinued}} 5110/3210/3310 models that were among the most popular mobile phones in the world during their time, before handsets developed several new features such as cameras, polyphonic ringtones and <b>colour</b> <b>screens.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The player {{supports}} all {{the standard}} formats, and {{also contains a}} photo viewer - images and videos can be viewed on the 4" [...] <b>colour</b> <b>screen</b> within the unit. The Gmini 500 is fully USB 2.0 compliant.|$|R

50|$|Transparency positives {{could be}} made from the system's {{panchromatic}} negatives by contact printing; these positives were then bound in register with a <b>colour</b> viewing <b>screen</b> of the same type as used for exposure, to reproduce the image in colour. Multiple copies could be printed from each negative, the resultant positives each being registered with their own <b>colour</b> viewing <b>screens.</b> If, on the other hand, a black-and-white print was required, the negative was used and the <b>colour</b> viewing <b>screen</b> ignored.|$|R

50|$|Advantages of the Paget {{system was}} that Paget plates were more {{sensitive}} than contemporary autochrome plates, allowing exposures of around 1/25 second (four times faster than autochrome), plus it was a negative/positive process with a separate <b>colour</b> <b>screen</b> which meant that multiple prints were straightforward to produce.|$|R

50|$|Finished Dufaycolor films {{suffer from}} the two {{shortcomings}} inherent in all mosaic <b>colour</b> <b>screen</b> processes: the réseau absorbs most of the viewing or projection light, requiring {{the use of an}} unusually bright light for normal image brightness, and if too greatly magnified, the individual colour filter elements become disruptively visible.|$|R
