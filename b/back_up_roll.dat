50|$|The {{heart of}} the temper mill is the cold rolling mill stand which {{produces}} the temper pass. It will include electric powered drive motors and speed reduction gearing suited to the process desired. The design of the rolling mill can be a 2-high or 4-high (even 6-high in some cases). The mill stand can be work roll driven or <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>roll</b> driven. The mill can be designed with hydraulic work roll bending or <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>roll</b> bending. Installations typically have a single rolling mill stand, but may have two. Pinch rolls provide back tension for the pay off reel in the entry section and entry and exit tension for the temper pass.|$|E
40|$|Work {{rolls in}} hot rolling mills are {{subjected}} to thermal and mechanical loads that could affect the surface integrity of the roll. To estimate the roll lifetime, the thermomechanical behaviour of the work roll was recently studied adopting a 2 D plain strain model. Nevertheless, even this 2 D approach requires an extremely long computational time, which allows only thermal loads {{to be considered in}} the mechanical analysis. Work rolls are axisymmetric structures subjected to cyclic non axisymmetric thermal and mechanical loads, thus, to further reduce the dimension of the problem, an original 1 D semi-analytical thermal and mechanical finite element is developed. Transient thermal and mechanical non linear analysis of a work roll is performed according to the initial stress method. The localized mechanical loads, which represents interaction of the work roll with the strip material and with the <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>roll,</b> are also taken into account...|$|E
40|$|First, back-up rolls {{for rolling}} require toughness, {{particularly}} in the shaft portion, and high-hardness in the sleeve portion. The back-up rolls are classified into two types; one is a single-solid type, {{and the other is}} a shrink-fitted construction type consisting of a sleeve and an arbor. The shrink- fitted <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>roll</b> has several advantages, for example, different materials can be chosen and the arbor can be reused by replacing the damaged sleeve. Therefore, the shrink-fitted back-up rolls are economical. However, residual deflection becomes a major problem for the shrink-fitted back-up roll. Elucidating the mechanism of the occurrence of residual deflection and devising countermeasures are important issues. Unfortunately conducting a real experiment is difficult because of much time and huge cost. In this paper, we reproduce this phenomenon by elastic FEM analysis, establish a simulation method, and elucidate the mechanism behind underlying residual deflection...|$|E

40|$|Roll {{inspection}} in roll grinding shops {{is necessary}} to ensure that rolls being returned to the hot strip mill after grinding are free from surface breaking cracks and internal defects that may cause roll failure during service. Hot strip mills in finishing stands normally utilize cast duplex type work rolls in alloy indefinite chill double poured (ICDP) or high chrome iron grades and <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>rolls</b> of alloy cast or forged heat treated steels. <b>Back</b> <b>up</b> <b>rolls</b> (BUR) suffer from mechanical pressure cracks in contact stress zones due to excess work hardening. These cracks move downwards through cyclic loading, if not detected and removed by grinding, and cause roll spalls or catastrophic failures. Work rolls in hot mills are subjected to severe thermal fatigue causing fire cracks {{on the surface and}} other mill operational deviations and accidents inducing surface and sub surface damage in roll body. Surface cracks with a depth more than 0. 2 mm have to be detected and removed by grinding. Apart from detection of surface cracks with eddy current, other sub surface flaws, shell depth measurement, internal flaws in shell and evaluation of disbonded conditions at shell/core interface are done with ultrasonic. <b>Back</b> <b>up</b> <b>rolls</b> are tested with eddy current and ultrasoni...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{surface of}} work <b>rolls</b> and <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>rolls</b> is worn out during hot rolling of heavy plates and strip steel because of micro {{structural}} changes and induced crack propagation. After {{the operation of}} the rolls in the mills, the surface will be regenerated by the following grinding process in the roll shops. This provides sufficient surface conditions for the next set in service. The roll shops of ThyssenKrupp Stahl will be gradually equipped with modern eddy current and ultrasonic techniques. The procedure for the implementation of these NDE techniques into the roll shop of a heavy plate mill will be described exemplarily. In the first step after bringing the installations into operational use, the former practice skills should be considered within the calibration of the systems. For this, the workmanship is documented by a statistical analysis of the signals obtained by these two non-destructive testing devices. Accordingly, the sensitivity of the operating systems is determined by comparing signals obtained from artificial notches with signals obtained from roll damages. These results are confirmed by taking micrographic examinations of the roll surface. After accurate confirmation {{of the relationship between the}} obtained signals and the condition of the rolls, the systems are fully set in service and integrated into {{the operation of the}} roll shop. This methodical approach contributes to a considerable benefit during the operation of the rolls since their service life is prolonged significantly. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} the possibility of the strengthening of bad quality reinforced concrete columns, in isolated stories, by two usual methods: the increase of the cross section with concrete, ?nd the <b>backing</b> <b>up</b> of <b>rolled</b> steel angles to the edges of the column. &# 13; The experimental work has consisted in the manufacturing, strengthening and testing of eighteen reinforced concrete columns with a low quality concrete. At a certain height above their bases a widening has been provided to represent the presence of a flat slab. &# 13; From the compression tests data and conclusions concerning the strength efficiency of the two types of strengthening have been obtained, also information on the distribution of forces between the original columns and the strengthening, {{as well as on the}} deformations, cracking and type of failure.
