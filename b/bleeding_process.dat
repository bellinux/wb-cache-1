5000|$|Long {{before a}} Joselito Iberian acorn-fed ham reaches a customer's plate, it must undergo {{a series of}} {{processes}} and phases. Once slaughtered, the pigs are quartered and divided into different parts according to their intended use, with the noble cuts of meat being selected and separated out. This is a traditional process whose link with the human factor is also a key component. Various cuts of meat are extracted from the Iberian pig, including the following: pluma (a feather-shaped, fatty cut, sometimes known as featherloin in English), presa (a small cut, taken from between {{the top of the}} shoulder and the loin), cabezada (the front part of the loin), sirloin, lagarto (a long, thin cut taken from between the loin and chops, sometimes known as lace back in English), abanico (called [...] "fan" [...] in Spanish, this is a tender, juicy cut taken {{from the top of the}} ribs), pork jowl, secreto (a highly marbled cut taken from a hidden part - hence its name - that lies behind the shoulder) and pork belly. The hams also undergo an initial selection and classification process that is based on an inspection of the outer part of each piece; an analysis of aspects such as the outline, size, weight and colour; and an analysis of samples taken from the inner part. The selected hams then proceed to the <b>bleeding</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

This study aims at proving whether or not Aloe vera gel could {{minimize}} the bleeding strain on rat’s ulcer (Rattus novergicus strain wistar) inducted by indometacin. It was a purely experimental research by means of the Posttest control group design. The samples were 20 female rats which were then classified into four groups. The first group was treated as positive control group in which we did not give any Aloe vera gel but Indometasin. On the other hand, the second, the third, and the fourth groups were treated by giving Aloe vera gel about 2 ml in its dosage in which they were inducted by Indometasin first. The parameter measured in this study was the width of the bleeding wound in the rat’s ulcer. The research finding showed that the giving of Aloe vera gel on Rat’s ulcer could significantly minimize the <b>bleeding</b> <b>process</b> on rat’s ulcer which had been inducted by indometasin (Anova, p = 0, 000), and there was strong and significant relationship between Aloe vera gel and the minimized width of rat’s ulcer (r = ­ 0, 860 and p< 0, 05). The minimized strain in rat’s ulcer was caused by the active result on substances inAloe vera that was; Aloin and Glukomannan. The Aloin working mechanism was to increase collagen and elastin synthesis, while Glukomannan could increase the destroyed epitel (reepitalization).

40|$|Background. S 100 β {{has been}} {{suggested}} as a marker of brain damage after cardiac operation. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the early S 100 β release in detail and relate it to neuropsychological outcome. Methods. Three groups of patients were investigated. All patients underwent coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) with extracorporeal circulation. In group A, 110 patients had sampling of S 100 β for the first 10 postoperative hours and also underwent neuropsychological testing. In group B, 14 patients were examined for the effect of autotransfusion on S 100 β levels. Eight patients in group C had their intraoperative <b>bleeding</b> <b>processed</b> with a cell-saving device. Results. Group A had a heterogeneous release pattern with several rapid elevations in S 100 β concentration. In group B, high concentrations of S 100 β were found in the autotransfusion blood (range 0. 2 to 210 μg/L) with a concurrent elevation of serum S 100 β levels after transfusion of shed blood. In group C, high levels of S 100 β were found in the blood from the surgical field (12. 0 ± 6. 0 μg/L) and decreased (1. 1 ± 0. 64 μg/L) after wash. Group C had significantly lower S 100 β values at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass compared to group A (0. 53 ± 0. 35 μg/L versus 2. 40 ± 1. 5 μg/L). S 100 β values were corrected for extracerebral contamination with a kinetic model. With this correction, an association was found between adverse neuropsychological outcome and S 100 β release in group A (r = 0. 39, p < 0. 02). Conclusions. A significant amount of S 100 β is found both in the blood from the surgical field and in the shed mediastinal blood postoperatively. Infusion of this blood will result in infusion of S 100 β into the blood and interfere in the interpretation of early systemic S 100 β values...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracerebral {{hemorrhage}} growth independently predicts {{disability and}} death. We hypothesized that noncontrast quantitative CT densitometry reflects active bleeding and improves predictive models of growth. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: We analyzed 81 of the 96 available baseline CT scans obtained 3 hours post-ICH from the placebo {{arm of the}} phase IIb trial of recombinant factor VIIa. Fifteen scans could not be analyzed for technical reasons, but baseline characteristics were not statistically significantly different. Hounsfield unit histograms for each ICH were generated. Analyzed qCTD parameters included the following: mean, SD, coefficient of variation, skewness (distribution asymmetry), and kurtosis (“peakedness ” versus “flatness”). These densitometry parameters were examined in statistical models accounting for baseline volume and time-to-scan. RESULTS: The coefficient of variation of the ICH attenuation was themost significant individual predictor of hematoma growth (adjusted R 2 0. 107, P. 002), superior to BV (adjusted R 2 0. 08, P. 006) or TTS (adjusted R 2 0. 03, P. 05). Themost significant combinedmodel incorporated coefficient of variation, BV, and TTS (adjusted R 2 0. 202, P. 009 for coefficient of variation) compared with BV and TTS alone (adjusted R 2 0. 115, P. 05). qCTD {{increased the number of}} growth predictionswithin 1 mL of actual 24 -hour growth by up to 47 %. CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneous ICH attenuation on hyperacute (3 hours) CT imaging is predictive of subsequent hematoma expansion and may reflect an active <b>bleeding</b> <b>process.</b> Further studies are required to determine whether qCTD can be incorporated into standard imaging protocols for predicting ICH growth...|$|E
40|$|Bleeding {{of cement}} based grout Bleeding of cement based grout {{is a complex}} problem. How it occurs and which basic {{mechanism}} causes and influences bleeding have been questions for discussion. Therefore {{the aim of the}} thesis is to illustrate what really happens with grout during bleeding and which factors influence it. In this way relevant measuring methods can be developed as well as the knowledge regarding how to interpret measuring results to joints in rock. The bleeding tests show that there are two basic mechanisms which cause bleeding. They are sedimentation and consolidation. It also means that the <b>bleeding</b> <b>process</b> is influenced by sample height. It was found that bleeding of coarse cement (ANL) was mainly a result of sedimentation of the grout. Experiment with fine cement (INJ 30; d 95 < 30 µm) shows that the consolidation part of bleeding was larger. The study shows that the <b>bleeding</b> <b>process</b> for a low sample height (10 mm) occurs fast. Extrapolation of experiment results and theoretical analysis shows that bleeding in a joint happens very fast and takes place during grouting itself. It means that results measured by standard methods can not be applied straight off for joints in rock. Theoretically bleeding occurs relatively slowly in vertical or inclined joints due to increased height. Bleeding will be resisted by arching and hardening. Reasonably, very little bleeding will take place. Filtration of cement based grout How far grout penetrates into a joint is not just influenced by the rheology of the grout like viscosity and shear strength, but also by the tendency of the grout to get stuck which means to build a plug. Factors which influence the building of a plug are properties of the grout, geometry of the joints including rawness of the joints and proceeding of the grouting. Today there are many different ways to measure filtration of a grout or the building of a plug. The different methods give different results and thus the importance of the influence of different factors is interpreted differently. The experiments in this thesis are done in a 100 mm long, 50 mm wide aperture with 1 mm width. Thereafter the width of the aperture decreases to 0. 02 – 0. 3 mm over a 10 mm long distance. The results of the experiments in this thesis, measured by own method, show that the best penetration ability with respect to filtration has a grout based on relatively fine-graded cement (INJ 30; d 95 < 30 µm). The penetrability of the grout based on more graded cement decreases because of flocculation. In total tens measurements have been done. The measurements confirm others’ experiments which show that the concentration of fine-graded particles (< 4 µm) has a large influence on flocculation and with that the building of larger grains. It is important to remind that the mixing of grout has been done by a laboratory mixer, which is not a mixer of colloidal type. This issue has to be further tested. The research shows that filtration of grout is also influenced by grain size of cement and the water cement ratio. The filtration test carried out by own measuring method with varying pressure showed a better penetrability for a larger pressure. It influenced both arching and erosion of the accumulated particles.

For the assessment of the influence of bleeding on the colour, spectrophotometrical measuring was used. The sensory quality was evaluated to an ISO 8529 standard by a trained staff member of the Institute of Aquaculture and Protection of Water. Both raw and cooked samples were evaluated. Microbiological analysis was done according to ISO 4833 standard and lipid oxidation measured by TBARS. The influence of the bleeding was observed in all colour parameters (L*, a* and b*). The average of L* values was 43. 7 +- 1; 42. 7 +- 1, a 43 +- 0. 9 in bled group and 37. 51 +- 0. 54; 37. 98 +- 0. 79; 37. 42 +- 0. 6 in unbled. The average of a* values was - 1. 4 +- 0. 2; - 1. 6 +- 0. 2; - 0. 9 +- 0. 4 in the bled group and 4. 5 +- 2. 3; 3. 6 +- 1. 6; 7. 4 +- 1 in the unbled group. A significant difference (p < 0. 05) between groups was observed in all days of study in the L* and a* parameter. In the b* parameter there was a difference observed just in the first nine days. A significant difference (p < 0. 05) between the bled and the unbled groups was observed in all criteria on the raw sample on the 1 st and 3 rd days. Cooked samples were significantly different (p < 0. 05) just on the 6 th day of study. Microbiological results came up to 4 +- 0. 2 log CFU. g- 1 in the bled group and 6. 3 +- 0. 1 log CFU. g- 1 in the unbled group. The influence of bleeding was shown in lipid oxidation too. At the end of the study TBARS values were 17. 8 +- 8. 8 ug. kg- 1 of the sample in the bled group and 39. 9 +- 6. 4 ug. kg- 1 of the sample in the unbled group. In both groups, exponential growth was shown. The influence of bleeding was observed in all parameters.

It may be possible to embolize vascular lesions through interventional radiology; this requires passing a catheter through a large artery and locating the maxillary artery under X-ray guidance, followed by the injection into the vessel of particles that occlude the blood vessels. The benefit from the procedure tends to be short-lived, and it may be most appropriate in episodes of severe bleeding.|$|R
50|$|Help {{from one}} of Sun-woo's loyal men {{provides}} him with money and new clothes to go about his plan: he secretly delivers Hee-soo a gift to make amends and sets up a meeting with some local arms dealers, but as they are affiliated with Kang's organization he ends up killing them over a deal to buy a handgun — this incurs a vendetta with the brother {{of one of the}} dealers, who promptly sets out to find Sun-woo. He then goes on to set up a veiled rendezvous with Baek Jr. and kills him after a brief conversation, but he is viciously stabbed in the <b>process.</b> <b>Bleeding,</b> his violent shooting spree leads directly to Kang amidst one of his business meetings, where he vents bitterly over how badly he has been treated despite his seven years of service. Kang does not answer, and instead asks if Sun-woo's actions were directly because of Hee-soo. Sun-woo then shoots him, prompting a shootout with Baek Dae-sik's henchmen, who had quickly picked up his trail.|$|R
40|$|Collagenous colitis {{is a rare}} {{condition}} characterised by watery diarrhoea. It {{is thought}} to be caused by a thick collagenous membrane found immediately beneath the colonic surface epithelium. We have studied specimens from 457 patients {{with a wide variety of}} large bowel diseases in order to determine the frequency, nature, and clinical correlations of the thick membranes. The normal membrane measured up to 3 microns. In 19 (4 %) of the patients studied there was significant thickening (greater than 10 mu). In 12 patients the thickening ranged from 10 - 15 mu, and six of this group had diarrhoea. In seven, the membrane exceeded 15 mu, and six patients had diarrhoea. There was no correlation between the nature of the disease <b>process,</b> <b>bleeding,</b> pain, constipation or previous medication. It did not vary with the age, nor at different sites of the colon. We concluded that no case in this series represented an example of true collagenous colitis but that significant thickening of the membrane occurs in other disease conditions and that a thick membrane, no matter how it arises, is causally associated with profuse watery diarrhoea...|$|R
40|$|Megakaryopoiesis is a complex, {{stepwise}} {{process that}} takes place largely in the bone marrow. At {{the apex of the}} hierarchy, hematopoietic stem cells undergo a number of lineage commitment decisions that ultimately lead to the production of polyploid megakaryocytes. On average, megakaryocytes release 1011 platelets per day into the blood that repair vascular injuries and prevent excessive <b>bleeding.</b> This differentiation <b>process</b> is tightly controlled by exogenous and endogenous factors, which have been the topics of intense research in the hematopoietic field. Indeed, a skewing of megakaryocyte commitment and differentiation may entail the onset of myeloproliferative neoplasms and other preleukemic disorders together with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, whereas quantitative or qualitative defects in platelet production can lead to inherited platelet disorders. The recent advent of next-generation sequencing has prompted mapping of the genomic landscape of these conditions to provide an accurateview of the underlying lesions. The aims of this review are to introduce the physiological pathways of megakaryopoiesis and to present landmark studies on acquired and inherited disorders that target them. These studies have not only introduced a new era in the fields of molecular medicine and targeted therapies but may also provide us with a better understanding ofthemechanismsunderlying normalmegakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis that can informeffortsto create alternativesources of megakaryocytes and platelets...|$|R
40|$|The {{paradigm}} of treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been recently {{challenged by the}} new direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). The {{aim of the research}} project was to evaluate the impact of DOACs on the management of pulmonary embolism (PE), isolated distal deep vein thrombosis (IDDVT) and <b>bleeding.</b> The approval <b>process</b> of DOACs was delayed in Italy and did not include IDDVT and, until 2015, PE. Therefore, the projects underwent some changes, with the aim of building solid bases for subsequent studies that will adopt DOACs. The project on PE was focused on the prognostic stratification, by applying the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI). The results of the study showed a 2 days significant difference of the median duration of hospital stay between low risk vs. high risk patients, as identified retrospectively by PESI. However, this difference has little clinical significance and led to hypothesize that prospectively adopting PESI may have a significant impact. With regards to IDDVT, a retrospective study was performed on 321 patients, who were treated with a short course of anticoagulation. The results showed a non negligible 15 % rate of recurrent VTE events. Therefore, many cases of IDDVT should be considered in the context of major VTE and may benefit from an extended treatment. Finally, the management of anticoagulant-associated bleeding was explored in a literature review and includes general resuscitation, diagnosis and local treatment of the bleeding source, as well as transfusion of red cells, clotting factor replacements and administration of antidotes and other prohaemostatic agents. Reversal strategies for the ‘conventional’ anticoagulants are based on clinical evidence, whereas evidence on DOACs is emergin...|$|R
