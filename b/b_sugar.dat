40|$|Growth rate {{dispersion}} (GRD) {{has long}} been observed in industrial sugar vacuum pan operation and is a principal cause in broadening crystal size distributions. This is the phenomenon where seeds with an initially narrow size distribution spread their size distribution because each sugar crystal grows at a different rate. These rate differences are maintained as crystals grow towards shipment size. There is a special case of GRD termed common history (CH) crystals, where the crystal size is proportional to its relative growth rate. As CH crystals grow, {{the shape of the}} size distribution on a log size scale is unchanged. Also dimensionless measures of spread, such as the coefficient of variation (CV), are constant. The CV of material in the high grade pan stage in Gunung Madu Plantation sugar factory, Indonesia, which produces plantation white sugar, has been measured. The seed materials were prepared in high grade graining, without washing, using the dissolved intermediate products (<b>B</b> <b>sugar</b> and C sugar). A similar measurement also has been carried out at the Broadwater sugar mill that adopts the classical three massecuite boiling formula, in which C sugar is prepared into magma and serves as footing material for A and B strikes. Shipment sugar is made from the mixture of A sugar and <b>B</b> <b>sugar.</b> The results showed that high grade sugars behave as common history crystals. Within the accuracy of sampling and sizing, the crystal size distributions as the crystals grow appeared to be of identical shape on a log size basis, demonstrating the size distribution reflects the growth rate distribution. This occurred in graining as well as in growth pans. Furthermore, the coefficient of variation values remained constant throughout the boiling process.

These data strongly suggest that A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b LPS is one of the receptors responsible for the lactose-inhibitable coaggregation of A. actinomycetemcomitans to fusobacteria. Lactose-inhibitable coaggregation is a common interaction among oral bacteria, including periodontal microorganisms such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacte-rium nucleatum.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of melanin production {{is important for}} managing skin darkness and hyperpigmentary disorders. Numerous anti-melanogenic agents that target tyrosinase activity/stability, melanosome maturation/transfer, or melanogenesis-related signaling pathways have been developed. As a rate-limiting enzyme in melanogenesis, tyrosinase {{has been the most}} attractive target, but tyrosinase-targeted treatments still pose serious potential risks, indicating the necessity of developing lower-risk anti-melanogenic agents. Sugars are ubiquitous natural compounds found in humans and other organisms. Here, we review the recent advances in research on the roles of sugars and sugar-related agents in melanogenesis and in the development of sugar-based anti-melanogenic agents. The proposed mechanisms of action of these agents include: (a) (natural sugars) disturbing proper melanosome maturation by inducing osmotic stress and inhibiting the PI 3 kinase pathway and (<b>b)</b> (<b>sugar</b> derivatives) inhibiting tyrosinase maturation by blocking N-glycosylation. Finally, we propose an alternative strategy for developing anti-melanogenic sugars that theoretically reduce melanosomal pH by inhibiting a sucrose transporter and reduce tyrosinase activity by inhibiting copper incorporation into an active site. These studies provide evidence of the utility of sugar-based anti-melanogenic agents in managing skin darkness and curing pigmentary disorders and suggest a future direction for the development of physiologically favorable anti-melanogenic agents...|$|E

40|$|Stabilization {{of sewage}} sludge (SS) prior to its land {{disposal}} may help control the mobility of SS-borne contaminants, particularly potentially toxic metals. We {{examined the effects of}} stabilized SS application on soil properties, biomass production, and phytoavailability of Cu and Zn to plants grown in two contrasting soils, Entisol and Aridisol. Stabilized SS mixtures were created by mixing SS in a 3 -to- 1 ratio with bentonite (<b>B),</b> <b>sugar</b> beet factory lime (SL), brick factory fly ash (BFA), rice straw (RS), water hyacinth (WH), and 50 : 50 mixture of RS and SL. Mixtures were applied at 50 Mg ha(- 1), and Sorghum vulgare L. and Eurica sativa were grown in a pot experiment. All the amendments increased plant availability and uptake of both Cu and Zn compared to the unamended control. The application of stabilized SS increased dry plant biomass significantly and decreased DTPA-extractable elements compared to the non-stabilized SS treatment. We conclude that of the six amendments studied, especially sugar beet factory lime (SL) and bentonite (B), are promising for the stabilization of metalcontaminated biosolids and should be tested under field conditions...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve Boer goat semen quality during {{cryopreservation}} process, the influence of sugar supplementation on semen characteristics of sperm were investigated. Three experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of (a) addition of two monosaccharides (fructose and glucose) and two disaccharides sugars (trehalose and sucrose) (<b>b)</b> <b>sugar</b> combination (fructose and trehalose, sucrose and trehalose, glucose and trehalose), and control (glucose without trehalose) (c) different concentrations of trehalose on cryopreservation using Tris based extender. The total motility, forward motility, viability, normal spermatozoa, acrosome integrity and membrane integrity were assessed subjectively. Differences were not detected among monosaccharides, but glucose increased (P 0. 05) among disaccharide sugar supplementation. Combination of glucose and trehalose significantly improved the characteristics of Boer spermatozoa after cryopreservation (P< 0. 05). Supplementation of trehalose (198. 24. mM) into the glucose extender significantly increased total motility, forward motility, live spermatozoa, acrosome integrity and membrane integrity following cryopreservation (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, glucose had the better ability to support Boer sperm motility and movement patterns. Combination of monosaccharide (glucose) and disaccharide (trehalose) improved semen quality following cryopreservation. Trehalose supplementation at the concentration of 198. 24. mM to the glucose extender conferred the greater improvement of semen quality for Boer semen cryopreservation. © 2010 Elsevier B. V. ...|$|E

Application of stabilized SS increased significantly Olsen-P, with high increasing rate with SBFL and WH-stabilized SS. Stabilized-SS decreased significantly Cu and Zn availability compared to mono SS treatment.

40|$|Chromomycin A 3 is an {{antitumor}} drug {{produced by}} Streptomyces griseus subsp. griseus. It {{consists of a}} tricyclic aglycone with two aliphatic side chains and two O-glycosidically linked saccharide chains, a disaccharide of 4 -O-acetyl-d-oliose (sugar A) and 4 -O-methyl-d-oliose (sugar B), and a trisaccharide of d-olivose (sugar C), d-olivose (sugar D), and 4 -O-acetyl-l-chromose <b>B</b> (<b>sugar</b> E). The chromomycin gene cluster contains four glycosyltransferase genes (cmmGI, cmmGII, cmmGIII, and cmmGIV), which were independently inactivated through gene replacement, generating mutants C 60 GI, C 10 GII, C 10 GIII, and C 10 GIV. Mutants C 10 GIV and C 10 GIII produced the known compounds premithramycinone and premithramycin A 1, respectively, indicating the involvement of CmmGIV and CmmGIII in the sequential transfer of sugars C and D and possibly also of sugar E of the trisaccharide chain, to the 12 a position of the tetracyclic intermediate premithramycinone. Mutant C 10 GII produced two new tetracyclic compounds lacking the disaccharide chain at the 8 position, named prechromomycin A 3 and prechromomycin A 2. All three compounds accumulated by mutant C 60 GI were tricyclic and lacked sugar B of the disaccharide chain, and they were named prechromomycin A 4, 4 A-O-deacetyl- 3 A-O-acetyl-prechromomycin A 4, and 3 A-O-acetyl-prechromomycin A 4. CmmGII and CmmGI are therefore responsible {{for the formation of}} the disaccharide chain by incorporating, in a sequential manner, two d-oliosyl residues to the 8 position of the biosynthetic intermediate prechromomycin A 3. A biosynthetic pathway is proposed for the glycosylation events in chromomycin A 3 biosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|Crystals of {{cyclodextrin}} glycosyltransferase (CGTase) from Bacillus circulans strain 251 were {{soaked in}} buffer solutions containing the pseudotetrasaccharide acarbose, a strong amylase- and CGTase inhibitor. The X-ray {{structure of the}} complex was elucidated at 2. 5 -Å resolution with a final crystallographic R value of 15. 8 % for all data between 8. 0 and 2. 5 Å. Acarbose is bound near the catalytic residues Asp 229, Glu 257, and Asp 328. The carboxylic group of Glu 257 is at hydrogen bonding distance from the glycosidic oxygen in the scissile bond between the B and C sugars (residue A is at the nonreducing end of the inhibitor). Asp 328 makes hydrogen bonds with the 4 -amino- 4, 6 -dideoxyglucose (residue B), and Asp 229 is in a close van der Waals contact with the C 1 atom of this sugar. From this we conclude that in CGTase Glu 257 acts as the proton donor and Asp 229 serves as the general base or nucleophile, while Asp 328 is involved in substrate binding and may be important for elevating the pKa of Glu 257. On {{the basis of these}} results it appears that the absence of the C 6 -hydroxyl group in the <b>B</b> <b>sugar</b> is responsible for the inhibitory properties of acarbose on CGTase. This suggests that the C 6 -hydroxyl group of this sugar plays an essential role in the catalytic mechanism of CGTase. The binding mode of acarbose in CGTase differs from that observed in the complex of pancreatic α-amylase with acarbose where the catalytic Glu was found to be hydrogen bonded to the glycosidic nitrogen linking the A and B residues. ...|$|E
40|$|Although the heteromeric {{combination}} of type 1 taste receptors 2 and 3 (T 1 r 2 + T 1 r 3) {{is well established}} as the major receptor for sugars and noncaloric sweeteners, {{there is also evidence}} of T 1 r-independent sweet taste in mice, particularly so for sugars. Before the molecular cloning of the T 1 rs, it had been proposed that sweet taste detection depended on (a) activation of sugar-gated cation channels and/or (<b>b)</b> <b>sugar</b> binding to G protein-coupled receptors to initiate second-messenger cascades. By either mechanism, sugars would elicit depolarization of sweet-responsive taste cells, which would transmit their signal to gustatory afferents. We examined the nature of T 1 r-independent sweet taste; our starting point was to determine if taste cells express glucose transporters (GLUTs) and metabolic sensors that serve as sugar sensors in other tissues. Using RT-PCR, quantitative PCR, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry, we determined that several GLUTs (GLUT 2, GLUT 4, GLUT 8, and GLUT 9), a sodium–glucose cotransporter (SGLT 1), and two components of the ATP-gated K+ (KATP) metabolic sensor [sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) 1 and potassium inwardly rectifying channel (Kir) 6. 1] were expressed selectively in taste cells. Consistent with a role in sweet taste, GLUT 4, SGLT 1, and SUR 1 were expressed preferentially in T 1 r 3 -positive taste cells. Electrophysiological recording determined that nearly 20 % of the total outward current of mouse fungiform taste cells was composed of KATP channels. Because the overwhelming majority of T 1 r 3 -expressing taste cells also express SUR 1, and vice versa, it is likely that KATP channels constitute a major portion of K+ channels in the T 1 r 3 subset of taste cells. Taste cell-expressed glucose sensors and KATP may serve as mediators of the T 1 r-independent sweet taste of sugars...|$|E
