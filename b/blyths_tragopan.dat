50|$|The Blue Mountain National park in Mizoram, India is {{currently}} taking surveys {{of how many}} different <b>Blyth’s</b> <b>tragopan</b> can be heard and seen in the area. The population {{was considered to be}} about 500 and 5000. The continuing monetization for the <b>Blyth’s</b> <b>tragopan</b> is essential for the conservation management aspect of the pheasant. Together with Blue Mountain and the organization proposal there will be a way to help the <b>Blyth’s</b> <b>tragopan.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Blyth’s</b> <b>tragopan</b> starts mating in April and {{continues}} well into May. The males advertise themselves with flamboyant displays to attract females.|$|R
50|$|BirdLife International has {{designated}} Eaglenest and Sessa sanctuaries as an Important Bird Area (IBA IN344), with <b>Blyth's</b> <b>tragopan</b> {{identified as}} a vulnerable species of the area.|$|R
50|$|In 1980 Kohima {{district}} became {{home to the}} Puliebadze Wildlife Sanctuary, {{which has}} an area of 9.2 km2. It is a natural habitat for <b>Blyth’s</b> <b>Tragopan.</b>|$|R
50|$|Overexploitation {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} threats to all birds {{including}} <b>Blyth’s</b> <b>tragopan.</b> Twelve percent of bird species are threatened to extinction and overexploitation. <b>Blyth’s</b> <b>tragopans</b> are considered to be the main threat to thirty seven percent of that number. Overexploitation reduces the population of the species and causes the listing of eleven percent of the threatened birds on the IUCN Red List. The biggest concern is the eleven critically endangered species for which overexploitation is believed to be the factor that the population numbers are declining.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blyth’s</b> <b>tragopan</b> (Tragopan blythii) or the grey-bellied tragopan is a {{pheasant}} that is {{a vulnerable}} species. The common name commemorates Edward Blyth (1810-1873), English zoologist and Curator of the Museum of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.|$|R
50|$|Birds some of {{the exotic}} species from North-east India are present in this {{wildlife}} sanctuary; like <b>Blyth's</b> <b>tragopan,</b> Mountain bamboo partridge, Crested Finchbill, Assam laughingthrush, Striped laughingthrush, Spot-breasted scimitar babbler, Flavescent Bulbul, Naga wren-babbler are to name few.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blyth’s</b> <b>tragopan</b> are generalists. In the wild, {{they consume}} seeds, berries, fruits, and buds. Captive birds usually consume insects, worms, and even small frogs. While they are {{primarily}} vegetarians, most birds have a predilection for berries and fruit.|$|R
50|$|The {{forests are}} home to over 500 species of bird some of which migrate to the higher Himalayas in the hot summer. There are twelve near-endemic bird species {{as well as the}} {{strictly}} endemic rufous-throated wren-babbler. A number of bird species especially pheasant, tragopan and hornbill are easily threatened by changes to their habitat and those found here include the globally threatened rufous-necked hornbill (Aceros nipalensis), Sclater's monal (Lophophorus sclateri), white-bellied heron (Ardea insignis), <b>Blyth's</b> <b>tragopan</b> (Tragopan blythii) and Ward's trogon (Harpactes wardi).|$|R

50|$|Lengteng {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of animal species {{including}} birds. The most notable birds are the dark-rumped swift, grey sibia, Mrs. Hume's pheasant, grey peacock pheasant, Oriental pied hornbill, rufous-bellied eagle, and white-naped yuhina. <b>Blyth’s</b> <b>tragopan</b> was also reported from a survey in 2011. Common animal species include tiger, leopard, sambar deer, barking deer, goral, serow, hoolock gibbon, rhesus macaque and wild boars. An IUCN-classified vulnerable species of primate, northern pig-tailed macaque is reported here.|$|R
50|$|The animal’s {{population}} {{is small and}} {{is believed to be}} decreasing at a rapid rate. <b>Blyth’s</b> <b>tragopan</b> is located in many different areas, including Bhutan through north-east India, north Myanmar to south-east Tibet, and also China. The total {{population is}} estimated to be about 2,500 to 9,999 birds. This estimate is a very small number compared to some of its relative birds. Tragopan blythii normally flocks to wooded areas as it prefers the undergrowth of evergreen oak and rhododendron forests, and other dark, quiet places. This bird has a higher elevation than most birds.|$|R
40|$|Government of Mizoram We {{conducted}} <b>Blyth’s</b> <b>Tragopan</b> status survey at two {{protected areas}} viz. Lengteng Wildlife Sanctuary (LWS) and Murlen National Park (MNP), Mizoram, north-eastern India during April-May 2011. By using call count technique we recorded {{the call of}} one male at an unusual time of 1142 hrs at LWS at an elevation of 2100 m inside the dense forest close to cliff area. The estimated population is 8 from the probable habitat of 15 km 2 in LWS. No signs of Tragopan were detected at MNP.

50|$|The area is {{encircled by}} matted bamboo groves and other {{alluring}} vegetations. There are varieties of butterflies, including some rare species {{found in this}} region. The Farpak area in Phawngpui is a huge grassland adjacent to a cliff area where one can sight birds like peregrine falcon, <b>Blyth's</b> <b>tragopan,</b> sunbirds, grey sibia, golden-throated barbet, Mrs. Hume's pheasant, hornbill, dark-rumped swift, mountain bamboo partridge, black eagle and other birds. The very rare clouded leopard has been recorded in the Farpak area since 1997. There have been instances of wild orchids being stolen from Phawngpui, efforts are being taken to protect and conserve it.|$|R
5000|$|The Dibang Wildlife Sanctuary {{is one of}} {{the eight}} {{wildlife}} sanctuaries of Arunachal Pradesh, India. It is located in the Upper Dibang Valley district covering an area of 4149 km2. The sanctuary is rich in wildlife.

It has been named the Mishmi Hills giant flying squirrel (Petaurista mishmiensis).Dibang Wildlife Sanctuary is located fully or partly within Dihang-Dibang Biosphere Reserve ...|$|R
50|$|The bird {{primarily}} {{moves up}} and down the slopes in search for food. It is, however, uncommon for this species to travel far, due to the change in climate from area to area. This {{is a result of the}} mild winters in their habitat, which are tolerable for longer periods of time. For the majority of the species, travel is only necessary in attempting to avoid the drying out of their vegetation. In this case, they may move down mountain sides for more comfortable living conditions and a readier food supply. There is little information or support on how the <b>Blyth’s</b> <b>tragopan</b> moves, but it is suggested that they travel together in groups of four to five, much like other species of tragopans.|$|R
25|$|About {{one-sixth of}} Nagaland {{is covered by}} {{tropical}} and sub-tropical evergreen forests—including palms, bamboo, rattan as well as timber and mahogany forests. While some forest areas have been cleared for jhum cultivation, many scrub forests, high grass, reeds; secondary dogs, pangolins, porcupines, elephants, leopards, bears, many species of monkeys, sambar, harts, oxen, and buffaloes thrive across the state's forests. The great Indian hornbill {{is one of the}} most famous birds found in the state. <b>Blyth's</b> <b>tragopan,</b> a vulnerable species of pheasant, is the state bird of Nagaland. It is sighted in Mount Japfü and Dzükou Valley of Kohima district, Satoi range in Zunheboto district and Pfütsero in Phek district. Of the mere 2500 tragopans sighted in the world, Dzükou valley is the natural habitat of more than 1,000.|$|R
50|$|About 200 {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} in this ecoregion of which six are endemic; chestnut-breasted partridge (Arborophila mandellii), hoary-throated barwing (Actinodura nipalensis), Ludlow's fulvetta, (Alcippe ludlowi), Nepal wren-babbler (Pnoepyga immaculata), buff-throated partridge (Tetraophasis szechenyii), and Lord Derby's parakeet (Psittacula derbiana). The last two are limited to an area of conifer forest in Arunachal Pradesh. Threatened or endangered birds of the ecoregion include Tibetan eared pheasant (Crossoptilon harmani) and Sclater's monal (Lophophorus sclateri) while {{a number of other}} birds are sensitive to habitat change and therefore potentially vulnerable, these include blood pheasant (Ithaginis cruentus), <b>Blyth's</b> <b>tragopan</b> (Tragopan blythii), satyr tragopan (Tragopan satyra), Ward's trogon (Harpactes wardi) and chestnut-breasted partridge. Indeed this ecoregion forms part of two BirdLife International Endemic Bird Areas {{because of the number of}} birds for which the confifers are important for breeding.|$|R
5000|$|The Phawngpui National Park is {{the natural}} home of a {{wonderful}} range of birdlife including the rare <b>Blyth's</b> <b>tragopan,</b> falcon, sunbirds, dark-rumped swift, and Mrs. Hume's pheasant, which is the Mizoram state bird, and also rare animals like the mountain goat, slow loris, tiger, leopard, leopard cat, serow, goral, Asiatic black bear, stump-tailed macaque and capped langur. In 2000, rare bird species were recorded such as mountain bamboo partridge, oriental pied hornbill, purple cochoa, striped laughingthrush, grey sibia, black eagle and large-billed crow. The clouded leopard Neofelis nebulosa was spotted and documented {{for the first time}} in 1997. [...] The landscape {{is the natural}} habitat of various grasses (in fact is the origin of the name, phawng in Lai dialect means [...] "meadow", and -pui is the suffix for [...] "great"). The steep slopes are covered by orchids and rhododendrons, with areas of bamboos.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blyth’s</b> <b>tragopan</b> {{pheasant}} is {{the largest}} of the genus Tragopan. Like most pheasants, the male is brightly colored. It is recognized by its rusty red head, yellow facial skin, and that it is spotted with small white dots on its back called ocelli. A black band extends {{from the base of the}} bill to the crown coupled with another black band extending behind the eyes. Like the rest of the tragopans, males have two pale blue horns that become erect during matting. Its lappet, a decorated flap, hangs from the throat and is brightly colored. This lappet can be expanded and exposed during mating season as well. Females are not as brightly colored as the male tragopan, for they do not need the extravagant appearance to attract a male counterpart. Overall, they are dark brown with a mixture of black, buff and white mottling. Their simple and dull look is a protection mechanism from other animals, known as camouflage. It also allows the females to protect their young that are in the early stages of life.|$|R
50|$|The Phobjika Valley {{has several}} {{vulnerable}} {{species of birds}} in the Protected Conservation Area established in 2003. The most celebrated species of the region is the black-necked crane. The other vulnerable species are the chestnut-breasted partridge (Arborophila mandellii), wood snipe (Gallinago nemoricola), <b>Blyth's</b> <b>tragopan</b> (Tragopan blythii), greater spotted eagle (Aquila clanga), imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), Baer's pochard (Aythya baeri), Hodgson's bushchat (Saxicola insignis), dark-rumped swift (Apus acuticauda), and grey-crowned prinia (Prinia cinereocapilla).The Conservation Area of 163 km2, which includes Gewogs of Phobji, Gangte and Bjena under the Wangdue Phodrang dzongkhag, has been leased out for Conservation Planning and Management to the Royal Society for the Protection of Nature (RSPN), a non-governmental organization (NGO) set up in Bhutan in 1987 (legally incorporated in 1997). RSPN is involved {{not only in the}} conservation management of the black-necked cranes and their habitat but also in conducting research on public education and awareness, community empowerment for conservation, and integrated conservation and development programmes, including community-based ecotourism in the valley. The black-necked cranes arrive in this valley in late October and depart in mid-February.|$|R
50|$|There {{are about}} 680 bird species. Some {{of them are}} Sclater's monal, <b>Blyth's</b> and Temminck's <b>tragopan,</b> chestnut-breasted partridge, rufous-necked hornbill, pale-capped pigeon, Ward's trogon, dark-sided thrush, green and purple cochoa, rusty-bellied and Gould's shortwing, {{beautiful}} nuthatch, rusty-throated and wedge-billed wren babbler, fire-tailed myzornis, at least four parrotbill species, black-headed greenfinch, scarlet finch and grey-headed bullfinch.|$|R
2500|$|The {{conservation}} area or habitat in the Phobhjikha Valley, established in 2003 has, {{not only the}} black-necked cranes, but also 13 other vulnerable species such as rufous-necked hornbill Aceros nipalensis, chestnut-breasted partridge Arborophila mandellii, Pallas's fish eagle Haliaeetus leucoryphus, nuthatch Sitta Formosa, wood snipe Gallinago nemoricola, <b>Blyth's</b> <b>tragopan</b> Tragopan blythii, greater spotted eagle Clanga clanga, imperial eagle Aquila heliaca, Baer's pochard Aythya baeri, Hodgson's bushchat Saxicola insignis, dark-rumped swift Apus acuticauda, and grey-crowned prinia Prinia cinereocapilla. The black-necked cranes arrive in this valley in late October and depart in mid February. They feed on the particular type of dwarf bamboos that grow in the wetlands of the valley. The thick grasslands of wetlands are also grazing grounds for {{a large number of}} cattle and horses during the summer months that helps the growth of the tender bamboo shoots on which the cranes feed later during the winter season. There were suggestions that the wetlands be drained and used to grow cash crops such as potatoes, which is also the main crop of the valley. Such an action would have deprived the cranes of their main feeding centres. However, Palje [...] "Benjie" [...] Dorji, former Chief Justice of Bhutan, former Minister for Environment and uncle of the present King of Bhutan, as the Chairman of the Royal Bhutan Society and as founder of the Black-necked Conservation Programme prevailed on the Government of Bhutan to drop the proposal to drain the wetlands of the Phobjika Valley to create farms to grow cash rich seed potatoes.|$|R
50|$|The Himalayas, {{created during}} the {{collision}} of the Indian and Asiatic continental plates, form the northern boundary of the Indian subcontinent. Valmik Thapar begins in the cold, dry desert of Ladakh, the northernmost region of India. A sequence of aerial mountain shots and typical fauna including snow leopard, Himalayan ibex and lammergeier is shown, followed by scenes of Buddhist monasteries and winter festivals. The Buddhist's respect for all nature stems from the ancient animist belief system in which animals were thought of as living embodiments of the spirit world. Wildlife is often plentiful around villages, where chukar, robin accentor and red-billed chough are commonly seen. Temperatures plunge to -30 Celsius in winter. Bharal can survive at great height by digging for roots or even climbing trees. Across the border in Pakistan, markhor are not so hardy, and must descend to lower elevations. In spring, melting snows reveal winter's casualties. Himalayan griffon vultures strip a carcass in 20 minutes, then lammergeiers carry away the bones. Further west in the meadows of Deosai, rarities such as Himalayan brown bears, kiang and black-necked cranes are filmed. Bar-headed geese cross the mountains to breed here, and marmots play fight in the meadows. Thapar then travels to {{the south side of}} the mountains where lush forests of oak, birch, spruce and rhododendron thrive on the monsoon rains. Animals in this region include Himalayan tahr, yellow-throated marten and grey langurs, shown feeding on Indian horse chestnut shoots. The golden langur, discovered in the 1950s, survives in the wild only in Bhutan and western Assam. In the north east of India, the animals of the Arunachal Pradesh are very different. Here, species from China and East Asia have colonised the forests. They include spectacular pheasants such as Himalayan monal, Temminck's <b>tragopan</b> and <b>Blyth's</b> <b>tragopan.</b> Mammals include red panda, Malayan giant squirrel and Hoolock gibbon, India's only ape. Valmik Thapar ends the programme at Namo Buddha in Nepal where legend has it Lord Buddha gave his life to a starving tigress and her cubs, and in doing so instilled a protective attitude to all creatures in his followers.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1992 A {{study of}} the phyletic {{relationships}} among five species of tragopans and an outgroup, the Blood Pheasant (Ithaginis cruentus), was conducted from 1987 to 1991. Biochemical, behavioral, and external morphologic characteristics were compared. A cladistic approach {{was used to compare}} the behavioral, biochemical, and external morphologic data collectively, as different phyletic relationships were obtained when each area of investigation was analyzed separately. Although unlike other pheasant species the genera Tragopan and Ithaginis molt their tail feathers centrifugally, study results did not indicate that these two groups were closely related. Based on a compilation of 25 characters, seven possible phylogenetic trees were generated. I rejected six of the seven trees based on current geographical distribution, morphology (size and complexity of lappet in males), behavior (wing coordination during the frontal display of male tragopans), and electrophoretic (number of unique alleles among the different species of tragopans) data. I accepted the tree that grouped Satyr and Western as closely related species and grouped Temminck's, <b>Blyth's,</b> and Cabot's <b>tragopans</b> together, with Temminck's and Cabot's being more closely related to each other than either was to Blyth's. I proposed that the prototype of tragopans probably had their origin in the eastern Himalayas. There were probably two major dispersal events; one population dispersed into central and south-east China and the Himalayas provided a corridor for the dispersal of a second population. Due to geological events in the Himalayas and China, these populations further split and eventually evolved into the extant forms...|$|R
