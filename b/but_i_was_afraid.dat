60|$|ELLIE. Oh, I'm so {{glad you}} think so. I think so too; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> {{it was only a}} silly fancy of my own.|$|E
60|$|He was talking, {{apparently}} to some one, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> to go {{near enough to}} hear what he was saying, lest I might frighten him, and he should run off.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! I thought I smelt it most deliciously as {{you came}} in, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> I only fancied it because I was {{thinking}} about it. Dear Cora, how good you are!' ...|$|E
60|$|LADY MARY. As you choose. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid,</b> Crichton, {{she will}} not suit us.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{doubt it}} is; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{not much of}} a sportsman. <b>I</b> used to <b>be</b> fond of fishing when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a lad, and thought I should like to try my hand at it again, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not as patient as <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> <b>I</b> don't think sea life is a good school for that sort of thing." ...|$|R
60|$|SYBIL [a heroine]. <b>I</b> hesitated, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> no longer; {{whatever}} he asks of me I will do.|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me, Miss Briscoe," [...] he said, {{springing}} {{up to her}} side. [...] "I was a clumsy idiot, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> that {{you would think that}} I had followed you. May I stay?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The color came up into Dan's face, and he {{kept his}} eyes fixed on his plate, as he said very low, [...] "No, ma'am, I'm glad, I wanted to stay, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> you--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! I saw his name; I remember! I gloried in the doings of a Keith; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> he had died, {{as there}} was no such name with the {{regiment}} when it came home." ...|$|E
60|$|Algernon. Yes, that is {{all very}} well; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> Aunt Augusta won't quite approve of your being here.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not too late, if {{you include}} Lucy, herself, in your conditions; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid,</b> Miles, it <b>is</b> 'too late' for Lucy." ...|$|R
60|$|Object. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not elected, or {{chosen to}} salvation, though {{you called me}} fool a little before for so fearing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because he's gone!" [...] said Tackleton; [...] "and the window's open. I don't see any marks--to be sure, it's {{almost on}} a level with the garden: <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> {{there might have been}} some--some scuffle. Eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sorry I couldn't calm your father, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> that {{anything}} I might say {{would only make}} him more excited," [...] he told her. [...] "I meant to go with him, but he wouldn't permit it." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{would have}} looked up at him, or held out my hand, or said a {{soothing}} word; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid,</b> if I stirred, I should either laugh or cry; so odd, in all this, was the mixture of the touching and the absurd.|$|E
60|$|Object. O, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> to pray, {{for fear}} my prayers should {{be counted as}} sin {{in the sight of}} the great God.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! that's {{my great}} recommendation; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> {{shall have to}} take the poacher up, with his quails and his pheasants, indeed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{not quite}} sure, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> your cottages <b>are</b> on that stratum {{where you could}} not bring the water without great expense.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After you swore so at poor Bradley I {{ordered that}} there should be no gongs when we were alone. I did come up to your door about half past eight. I crept up. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> I might upset you if I came in." ...|$|E
6000|$|The rider drew rein and the {{landlord}} introduced {{me as the}} man who was in need of a mount. Each moment my desire to own the horse deepened, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> to show even approval. [...] "How much do you want for him?" [...] I asked indifferently.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Stanislas!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "This is a pleasure, indeed. I {{never for}} a moment dreamt of seeing you. I heard from the Jew who guarded me that you got away, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> that you had been badly wounded. Why, my brave fellow, what brings you here?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{tried to}} smile in a non-committal sort of way, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> there <b>were</b> things in my face beyond my power to control.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> they <b>are</b> drowned," [...] {{and now the}} fun-loving Rover became serious. [...] "What {{makes you}} think that?" [...] asked Sam.|$|R
6000|$|... 'To be sure! to be sure!' replied Montague. 'Nothing more natural. I foresaw that, and {{provided}} against it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> interrupting you.' ...|$|R
60|$|In the morning, leaving Bellinzona, again I went {{in terror}} of the new, evil high-road, with its {{skirting}} of huge cubical houses and its seething navvy population. Only the peasants driving in with fruit were consoling. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of them: the same spirit had set in in them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will be here}} at nine," [...] Harry said, [...] "and will {{go round}} before that and tell her sisters. They will be {{wondering}} they have seen nothing of me to-day, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> to tell them until it was all over. The anxiety {{would have been too}} great for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I had {{no fear of}} him," [...] {{answered}} Elliott. [...] "I don't {{see what}} induced him to go in, anyhow. He must have known he'd no chance. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of Stone--he's a born dabster at mathematics, you know, and I only hold my own in them by hard digging." ...|$|E
60|$|Objection. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not [of the] elect, or {{chosen to}} salvation, though {{you called me}} fool a little before for so fearing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indifferently well, Mr. Oldbuck; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid,</b> {{not quite}} {{able to receive}} your congratulations, or to pay--to pay--Mr. Lovel his thanks for his unparalleled exertions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Truth {{is better}} than fiction, certainly. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> he has a {{tendency}} to morbid self-contemplation, and you ought to shake him out of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Chingachgook--my brother!" [...] {{said the}} guide in the dialect of the other's people, a tremor shaking his voice that betrayed the {{strength}} of his feelings. [...] "Chief of the Mohicans! My heart is very glad. Often have we passed through blood and strife together, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> it was never to be so again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Beforehand with us?' asked Mr. Audley, as Felix broke down. 'The nurse {{has been}} just telling me how he sat on his bed saying bits of psalms and verses {{to him when he}} had that bad fit of cramp, [...] "so pretty," [...] she said; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> it must have been rather like a spell.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{pretended that}} he was never happy out of my presence," [...] sobbed Henrietta. [...] "There never was {{anything}} so cruel. I often wanted to be by myself for a change, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> to hurt his feelings by saying so. And now he has no feelings. But he must come back to me. Mustn't he, mamma?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't--want him to love me," [...] she sobbed. [...] "Oh, I {{know that}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> foolish and wicked and childish, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} trying to {{entertain}} him, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> a very poor substitute. However, I have persuaded him to stay for supper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't have {{beat you}} at all, unless I {{had meant to}} hurt you,' said Bella. 'Did I pinch your legs, Pa?' ...|$|R
