40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} whether the train axle cross wedge rolling(CWR) using square billet as blank is available or not. Based on numerical simulation software DEFORM- 3 D, we built the finite element model. And the whole forming process was simulated successfully. The stress and strain distributions of workpiece in the process were analyzed. The effect of forming angle, stretching angle and billet size on rolling force was investigated, then determined the proper process parameters. The differences between the round <b>billet</b> <b>rolling</b> and the square <b>billet</b> <b>rolling</b> were obtained by comparing the tangential, axial and radial forces during the rolling process. The studied results show the availability of using square billet as blank in train axle CWR and provide important realistic meaning and application value. The cross wedge rolling(CWR) is a metal deformation process of rotary forming. To produce a part, a billet should be placed between two rollers, which move tangentially relative to each other. The billet suffers plastic deformation during its rotation between two rollers. Compared with the traditional practices of forging and machining, CWR possesses many advantages, such as greate...|$|E

In this paper, {{we present}} an {{analytic}} approach for {{the prediction of}} roll force to be applicable to the <b>billet</b> <b>rolling</b> process which consists {{of a series of}} horizontal stands and vertical stands. The approach is based on the deformation shape and employs the assumption that the deformation homogeneously occurs in three directions. Strain and strain rate are calculated by the geometric relationships between those components and the prescribed deformation functions. By integrating the stress components along the rolling direction, roll force is finally obtained. The prediction accuracy of the proposed model is examined through comparison experimentally mesured roll force with computed ones...|$|E

40|$|Continuous {{furnaces}} with roller hearth have wide {{application in}} the steel industry. Typically, furnaces with roller hearth belong to the class of medium-temperature heat treatment furnaces, but {{can be used to}} heat the <b>billets</b> for <b>rolling.</b> In this case, the furnaces belong to the class of high temperature heating furnaces, and their efficiency depends significantly on the reliability of the roller hearth furnace. In the high temperature heating furnaces are used three types of watercooled shaft rollers, namely rollers without insulation, rollers with insulating screens placed between the barrel and the shaft, and rollers with bulk insulation. The definition of the operating conditions of rollers with water-cooled shaft greatly facilitates the choice of their design parameters when designing. In this regard, at the design stage of the furnace with roller hearth, {{it is important to have}} information about the temperature distribution in the body of the rollers at various operating conditions. The article presents the research results of the temperature field of the hearth rollers of metallurgical heating furnaces. Modeling of stationary heat exchange between the oven atmosphere and a surface of rollers, and between the cooling water and shaft was executed by finite elements method. Temperature fields in the water-cooled shaft rollers of various designs are explored. The water-cooled shaft rollers without isolation, rollers with screen and rollers with bulk insulation, placed between the barrel and the water-cooled shaft were investigated. Determined the change of the thermo-physic parameters of the coolant, the temperature change of water when flowing in a pipe and shaft, as well as the desired pressure to supply water with a specified flow rate. Heat transfer coefficients between the cooling water and the shaft were determined directly during the solution based on the specified boundary conditions. Found that the greatest heat losses occur in the rollers without insulation. Insulation (screens or bulk insulation) between the shaft and the barrel of roller allows reducing the cooling water losses. A comparative analysis of research results allowed us to find that operating conditions of the furnace rolls with screen insulation are more favorable in terms of thermal conditions and losses, than those of rollers without the insulation and rollers with the bulk insulation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor a {{specific}} ring rolling, the quantitative {{design of the}} <b>rolling</b> <b>billet</b> and feeding strategy {{is the most important}} factor to obtain the ideal process. This research focuses on developing the quantitative design methodology for the flat ring rolling in a systematic way. The paper is organized in two parts: billet constraint and feeding interval in the flat ring rolling. In the first part, the constraint conditions for both the piercing process and ring rolling are taken into consideration, deducing the limiting wall thickness and the limiting height of the billet for {{a specific}} ring rolling. And for the second part, the expansion of ring outer diameter, the rolling force and rolling temperature, the form error occurrence together with the gripping and penetration condition are included to generate the feeding interval. In the feeding interval created, the response of ring material to the processing parameters must also be considered. So for a specific ring rolling, we established the processing map of the material used. Based on that, a desirable feeding strategy that could obtain a higher efficiency of power dissipation was determined by means of the subroutine VUAMP in ABAQUS. Practical ring rolling experiment was carried out and the microstructure of the finished ring was also observed. The experiment shows that the deformed ring was rolled to the final dimension in a stable manner without macroscopic or microscopic defects, which indicated that the quantitative design of the flat ring rolling process is reasonable...|$|R
50|$|Rolling mills {{are often}} divided into roughing, {{intermediate}} and finishing rolling cages. During shape <b>rolling,</b> an initial <b>billet</b> (round or square) with edge of diameter typically ranging between 100-140 mm is continuously deformed {{to produce a}} certain finished product with smaller cross section dimension and geometry. Different sequences can be adopted to produce a certain final product starting from a given <b>billet.</b> However,since each <b>rolling</b> mill is significantly expensive (up to 2 million euros), a typical requirement is to contract the number or rolling passes. Different approaches have been achieved including empirical knowledge, employment of numerical models, and Artificial Intelligence techniques. Lambiase et al. validated a finite element model (FE) for predicting the final shape of a rolled bar in round-flat pass. {{one of the major}} concern when designing rolling mills is {{to reduce the number of}} passes; a possible solution to such requirement is represented by the slit pass also called split pass which divided an incoming bar in two or more subpart thus virtually increasing the cross section reduction ratio per pass as reported by Lambiase.Another solution for reducing the number of passes in the rolling mills is the employment of automated systems for Roll Pass Design as that proposed by Lambiase and Langella. subsequently, Lambiase further developed an Automated System based on Artificial Intelligence and particularly an integrated system including an inferential engine based on Genetic Algorithms a knowledge database based on an Artificial Neural Network trained by a parametric Finite element model and to optimize and automatically design rolling mills.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{estimation}} of heat temperature influence {{and degree of}} hot reduction of carbon steel {{on the size of}} grain аustenite at making of railway wheels. Methodology. The material for research was carbon steel, mark 60 with carbon content of 0, 55 and 0, 65 %, selected from the fragments of railway wheels. The size of grain аustenite depending on a temperature (from 800 to 1 150 ºC) and degrees of hot deformation (10 − 50 %) was determined. The size of grain was determined under a light microscope with the use of quantitative metallography methods. Findings. The use of cooling in the process of hot reduction of the railway wheel will allow dispergating the structure of аustenite on large distances {{from the surface of the}} rim. The reason for this is that the volumes of metal after cooling have an increased strength and will be exposed in less degree to the plastic deformation. To compare the cooling layers near-by with the surface of rim, they are more warmed-up in internal volumes of metal. In the conditions of continuity of plastic deformation distribution, having a high temperature, they will be exposed to the reduction on the large total degree of deformation. In consequence of the resulted decisions more even austenitic structure must be formed on the section of rim of railway wheel. To obtain the effect of disperse grain of аustenite at making of the whole-rolled railway wheels it is necessary to decrease the heat temperature of <b>billet</b> under <b>rolling</b> or increase the degree of reduction on the lasts stages of shape-generating deformation. The pause by duration of 1, 5 min. after reduction of 20 % at a temperature 950 ºC is sufficiently for processes completion of dynamic and static recrystalization of аustenite carbon steel of the railway wheel. Originality. Increase of plastic deformation degree, especially in the central volumes of rim is accompanied by the decrease of heterogeneity of austenitic structure on his section. The mechanism of disperse structure of аustenite is based on slow down of development processes of recrystallization in carbon steel at the metal reduction temperature decrease of elements in the railway wheel when they are formed on a rolling mill. Practical value. Temperature decrease of hot reduction of billets in the conditions of flatting mill from 1240 − 1260 ºC to 1 150 ºC is accompanied by decrease of size grain of аustenite from a 0 − 1 mark to 2 − 5 in the different elements of the railway wheel...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} {{published}} literature {{was made to}} establish the fundamental aspects of rolling and allow an experimental programme to be planned. Simulated hot rolling tests, using pure lead as a model material, were performed on a laboratory mill to obtain data on load and torque when rolling square section stock. Billet metallurgy and consolidation of representative defects was studied when modelling the rolling of continuously cast square stock {{with a view to}} determining optimal reduction schedules that would result in a product having properties to the high level found in fully wrought billets manufactured from large ingots. It is difficult to characterize sufficiently the complexity of the porous central region in a continuously cast billet for accurate modelling. However, holes drilled into a lead <b>billet</b> prior to <b>rolling</b> was found to be a good means of assessing central void consolidation in the laboratory. A rolling schedule of 30 % (1. 429 : 1) per pass to a total of 60 % (2. 5 : 1) will give a homogeneous, fully recrystallized product. To achieve central consolidation, a total reduction of approximately 70 % (3. 333 : 1) is necessary. At the reduction necessary to achieve consolidation, full recrystallization is assured. A theoretical analysis using a simplified variational principle with experimentally derived spread data has been developed for a homogeneous material. An upper bound analysis of a single, centrally situated void has been shown to give good predictions of void closure with reduction and the reduction required for void closure for initial void area fractions 0. 45 %. A limited number of tests in the works has indicated compliance with the results for void closure obtained in the laboratory...|$|R
