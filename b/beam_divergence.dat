2500|$|The {{shape of}} a Gaussian beam of a given {{wavelength}} λ is governed solely by one parameter, the beam waist [...] w0. This {{is a measure of}} the beam size at the point of its focus (z=0 in the above equations) where the beam width w(z) (as defined above) is the smallest (and likewise where the intensity on-axis (r=0) is the largest). From this parameter the other parameters describing the beam geometry are determined. This includes the Rayleigh range [...] zR and asymptotic <b>beam</b> <b>divergence</b> θ, as detailed below.|$|E
50|$|The <b>beam</b> <b>divergence</b> of a {{laser beam}} is a measure for how fast the beam expands far from the beam waist. It is usually defined as the {{derivative}} of the beam radius {{with respect to the}} axial position in the far field, i.e., in a distance from the beam waist which is much larger than the Rayleigh length. This definition yields a divergence half-angle. (Sometimes, full angles are used in the literature; these are twice as large.) For a diffraction-limited Gaussian beam, the <b>beam</b> <b>divergence</b> is λ/(πw0), where λ is the wavelength (in the medium) and w0 the beam radius (radius with 1/e2 intensity) at the beam waist. A large <b>beam</b> <b>divergence</b> for a given beam radius corresponds to poor beam quality. A low <b>beam</b> <b>divergence</b> can be important for applications such as pointing or free-space optical communications. Beams with very small divergence, i.e., with approximately constant beam radius over significant propagation distances, are called collimated beams. For the measurement of <b>beam</b> <b>divergence,</b> one usually measures the beam radius at different positions, using e.g. a beam profiler. It is also possible to derive the <b>beam</b> <b>divergence</b> from the complex amplitude profile of the beam in a single plane: spatial Fourier transforms deliver the distribution of transverse spatial frequencies, which are directly related to propagation angles. See US Laser Corps application note for a tutorial on how to measure the laser <b>beam</b> <b>divergence</b> with a lens and CCD camera.|$|E

The ratio of the BPP of the real beam to that of an ideal Gaussian beam at the same wavelength is known as M2 ("M squared"). The M2 for a Gaussian beam is one.
