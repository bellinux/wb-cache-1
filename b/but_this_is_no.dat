25|$|Another unique aspect, {{compared}} to other minor pro leagues of North America, {{is the absence of}} a veteran limit rule, which allows teams to stock up on experienced players. The league is slowly trying to clean itself up (for 2005–06, the roster limit went from 20 to 19 players, which for most teams meant one less enforcer), <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> easy task for a league that has always been popular with the fans for its reputation of being the toughest league in the world.|$|E
25|$|Synchronized diving {{was adopted}} as an Olympic sport in 2000. Two divers form {{a team and}} perform dives simultaneously. The dives are identical. It used to be {{possible}} to dive opposites, {{also known as a}} pinwheel, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer part of competitive synchronized diving. For example, one diver would perform a forward dive and the other an inward dive in the same position, or one would do a reverse and the other a back movement. In these events, the diving would be judged both on the quality of execution and the synchronicity – in timing of take-off and entry, height and forward travel.|$|E
25|$|The abbey site {{would have}} been {{enclosed}} by a perimeter ditch <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer apparent. The precinct is still partly enclosed by a wall of undressed stone, around {{the south and west}} sides. The entrance to the abbey was about 130 metres north of the church, where the gatehouse has been traced. There {{would have been}} other buildings serving the community and its guests between the gatehouse and the church but these too remain only in bare outline. The remains of the artificial landscape created in the Middle Ages are discernible further to the north. A reservoir and three possible fish ponds can be identified, along with various other medieval features.|$|E

25|$|In higher education, {{a college}} is {{normally}} a provider {{that does not}} hold university status, although it can also refer to a constituent part of a collegiate or federal university or a grouping of academic faculties or departments within a university. Traditionally the distinction between colleges and universities was that colleges did not award degrees while universities did, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer the case with NCG having gained taught degree awarding powers (the same as some universities) on behalf of its colleges, {{and many of the}} colleges of the University of London holding full degree awarding powers and being effectively universities. Most colleges, however, do not hold their own degree awarding powers and continue to offer higher education courses that are validated by universities or other institutions that can award degrees.|$|E
25|$|Within some Friends Churches in the Evangelical Friends Church, in {{particular}} in Rwanda, Burundi, {{and parts of the}} U.S., an adult believer's baptism by immersion in water, is optional. Within Liberal Friends, Conservative Friends, and Pastoral Friends Churches, Friends do not practise water baptism, Christening, or other initiation ceremonies to admit a new member or a newborn baby. Children are often welcomed into the meeting at their first attendance. Formerly, children born to Quaker parents automatically became members (sometimes called Birthright membership), <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer the case in many areas. Some parents apply for membership on behalf of their children, while others allow the child to decide whether to become a member when they are ready, and older in age. Some meetings adopt a policy that children, some time after becoming young adults, must apply independently for membership.|$|E
25|$|Not all Greeks {{agreed with}} the geocentric model. The Pythagorean system has already been mentioned; some Pythagoreans {{believed}} the Earth {{to be one of}} several planets going around a central fire. Hicetas and Ecphantus, two Pythagoreans of the 5th century BC, and Heraclides Ponticus in the 4th century BC, believed that the Earth rotated on its axis but remained {{at the center of the}} universe. Such a system still qualifies as geocentric. It was revived in the Middle Ages by Jean Buridan. Heraclides Ponticus was once thought to have proposed that both Venus and Mercury went around the Sun rather than the Earth, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer accepted. Martianus Capella definitely put Mercury and Venus in orbit around the Sun. Aristarchus of Samos was the most radical. He wrote a work, which has not survived, on heliocentrism, saying that the Sun was at the center of the universe, while the Earth and other planets revolved around it. His theory was not popular, and he had one named follower, Seleucus of Seleucia.|$|E
