40|$|The Singhason hill {{range in}} Assam is a {{cultural}} landscape with rich biodiversity and implications for conservation of biodiversity. In recent years, the hill range has been under pressure particularly from human interference that poses considerable threats to biodiversity and the landscape. There is no previous study on environment of Singhason hills due to which biodiversity status, agricultural practices and other related aspects of the hill are unknown. In the present paper, drivers of environmental deterioration in Singhason landscape and opportunities for its conservation are discussed. Data collection included interview and participant observations; informant responses on drivers of environmental deterioration have been presented as Relative Frequency. Over-harvesting is the most potent driver with RF score of 91. 7 % followed by mining of lime stone and coal (83. 3 %), monoculture with rubber and teak (35. 4 %) and shifting cultivation (12. 5 %). Overexploitation is the major cause of degradation of agar-wood, cinnamon, <b>black</b> <b>dammar,</b> rattans and bamboo resources. Agroforestry with local plants such as <b>black</b> <b>dammar,</b> cinnamon, broom grass, orange, pineapple and pear hold promises for food production, food security, nutrition, health and socio-cultural benefits...|$|E
40|$|Millions {{of people}} {{worldwide}} {{depend on the}} harvest of non-timber forest products (NTFP) for their livelihoods, {{and the importance of}} understanding the complex relationships between NTFP harvest and conservation is increasingly recognized. This study employs a cross-disciplinary, regional approach to identify some of the links between patterns of harvest, trade, and conservation of one of South India&# 039;s most heavily harvested resins, Canarium strictum Roxb. (Burseraceae), or <b>black</b> <b>dammar.</b> We focus on indigenous communities in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (NBR) and ask: How is C. strictum tapped and is there variation across communities? How is C. strictum resin sold and bought, and what trade routes are involved? What are the impacts of tapping on C. strictum trees and population structure? We carried out interviews and focus-group discussions with harvesters in eight villages in three different regions, and with buyers and traders inside and outside of the NBR. We also established twenty-two 20 x 20 m plots to document population structure. Three broad resin-harvest strategies were identified: collection from natural fissures, tapping using incisions, and tapping using incisions and fire, each practiced in a different region. However, within each strategy there was large variation in tapping frequency and timing, tenure practices, and resin quality. The loss of tree tenure in some areas has led to a higher frequency of tapping and to the production of lower quality, lower value resin. Factors driving changes in both tenure and tapping strategies include rising commercial demand and value, pressure from outside harvesters, changes in livelihood strategies, and habitat destruction. Tapping leads to elevated mortality of C. strictum adults, with fire-tapping have a greater negative impact than tapping with no fire. The combination of social and ecological approaches used here provides insight on strategies for better conservation of C. strictum. These include the promotion of tapping and sale of only high-grade resin&# 8212;which is a good indicator of sustainable harvest&# 8212;enrichment planting to help address some of the underlying causes of overharvest, and sparing of some trees for increased reproduction...|$|E
