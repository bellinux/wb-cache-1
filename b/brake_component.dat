40|$|This report {{represents}} the bachelor thesis examination by Julia Kastehelmi Rintamäki. The examination has been performed during spring semester 2013 at Volvo Construction Equipment in Eskilstuna. This report, Development of parking <b>brake</b> <b>component,</b> describes the {{product development process}} of the parking <b>brake</b> <b>component</b> for articulated hauler, wheel loader and grader. Volvo CE has problems with the parking brake switch that exist today on articulated hauler, wheel loader and grader. The purpose of this project is to develop one common solution for the parking <b>brake</b> <b>component</b> for articulated hauler, wheel loader and grader. The secondary purpose is to find final concept proposal for each machine. Employees at the Volvo CE were interviewed; they were contacted via e-mail, phone calls and via meetings {{to get the information}} about the machines and the information around the parking <b>brake</b> <b>component.</b> Volvo CE databases were also used for gathering information about standards and pictures. Lots of different ideas were sketched and concept proposals were created with the aid of material from marketing analysis, competitor analysis, target group analysis, requirement specification, function analysis, standards and ergonomics. Eight concept proposals were chosen to be evaluated with QFD, Pugh’s matrix and FMEA. Two concepts were most suitable and developed further to three dimensional models with the aid of Solid Works. The different aspects were taken into account when designing and dimensioning the final concepts. Two models were created with the aid of plasticine for figuring out the ergonomics and dimensions of the product. DFM, DFA, DFE, D 4 S were used for taking into account costs, assembly, dimensions and environmental impacts of this product. One of the concepts could replace the existing parking brake switch and suit in different cabins because of its size and design. This concept can be located on vertical or on horizontal plane. The other final concept solution functions better for the  articulated hauler on account of the double function with exhausting brake system activating before parking brake system. Suggestion for next steps for the project could be to make prototypes of the two concepts and test these components in real machines. Also interviewing users for further development of the final concepts and redesign if needed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The dynamic contact {{pressure}} distribution in a disc brake system remains impossible to measure through experimental methods. This makes numerical analysis using the {{finite element method}} an indispensable alternative tool to its prediction. However, the finite element model must first be validated through appropriate analyses so that realistic predicted results can be obtained. This paper proposes and carries out a three-stage validation methodology: validating the dynamic aspect of each <b>brake</b> <b>component</b> and the brake assembly using modal testing data and the contact aspect using the experimental results of static {{contact pressure}}. A detailed 3 -dimensional finite element model of an actual disc brake was developed. Brake pad surface topography is also taken into consideration. Good agreement is achieved between predicted and experimental results both in modal analysis and static contact pressure distributions. Once a validated model was obtained, contact analysis for dynamic condition of the disc brake is performed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of single front wheel brake can yield large deceleration on underbone motorcycle. However, the motorcycle motion potentially {{exposed to the}} nosedive effect during this application. Therefore, {{in order to avoid}} this issue, the {{application of}} concurrent brake are required. Hence, this research was carried out to understand the basic braking performance for underbone motorcycle and elucidate the influenced of concurrent braking application involving the front and rear <b>brake</b> <b>component.</b> A theoritical study was carried out in this work through the derivation of motion equation for underbone motorcycle. The preliminary results showed that the total brake force and the brake force component acting on the front wheel had increased linearly with its deceleration intensity. Further study showed that in order to achieve higher safety range, the brake force applied on the front wheel should be at least 70 % higher than the rear brake force intensity. This is probably due to the weight transferred condition during the underbone motorcycle braking...|$|E
40|$|International audienceScanning laser {{vibrometer}} measurements generate detailed maps of modal {{characteristics in}} normal or 3 D directions. Since many points are measured, individual validation of cannot be performed manually {{in a reasonable}} time frame and a notable fraction of measurements {{is expected to be}} fairly noisy. The key new notion of the paper is a quantiﬁcation of identiﬁcation error and level of contribution for each mode and each sensor based on the comparison of measured and synthesized transfers around each resonance. These criteria are shown to allow efﬁcient analysis of the validity of large measurement sets to provide an automated procedure to select sensors that should be kept for each mode. This quantiﬁcation, being performed before correlation, provides a priori estimates of sources of poor correlation associated with the identiﬁcation process. It thus becomes possible to provide improved Modal Assurance Criterion estimations where, for each modeshape, sensors known to be incorrectly identiﬁed can be discarded. The 3 D vibrometer scan of a <b>brake</b> <b>component</b> is used to illustrate the proposed strategies...|$|E

40|$|Applied use of Silicon {{infiltrated}} SiC matrix carbon fiber-reinforced carbon composites (hereinafter {{referred to}} as Si-SiC matrix C/C composites) Si-SiC matrix C/C composites to improve the properties of C/C composites for use as materials in sliding parts such as brakes is on the increase. As such, we have investigated the behavior of sliding wear on these materials by measuring and observing the amount of sliding wear volume and friction coefficient of the Si-SiC matrix C/C composites, based upon analysis in which these attributes were converted to dimensionless numbers for evaluation of life-span. Based on the results, we conclude that 1) when contact pressure (compressive stress) is applied to a Si-SiC matrix C/C composite, a difference in level between the contact surfaces occurs according {{to the difference between}} the elastic modulus of the C/C composite portion and the Si-SiC matrix portion of the material of which the composite is composed, and this difference in level grinds against the opposing material, causing abrasion, 2) the aforementioned difference in level becomes a primary factor, indicating higher friction coefficient values for Si-SiC matrix C/C composite material than for the friction coefficient of the C/C composite material, and 3) when comparing Si-SiC matrix C/C composite material and C/C composite material as a <b>brake</b> <b>component,</b> the Si-SiC matrix C/C component material is superior, having a higher friction coefficient and a lesser amount of wear volume associated with braking mechanisms (componen...|$|E
40|$|During vehicle {{maintenance}} some components, such as {{motor oil}} and filters are replaced when {{certain period of}} time has passed or mileage reached. Braking system components which are subject to friction and wearout have to replaced when certain minimal thickness is reached. Manufacturer of vehicle provides information about initial and minimal size of braking components. It is a rare situation if the brake pads or discs are found at minimal thickness during inspection at scheduled maintenance. In the real aftersales workshop conditions mechanic have to evaluate condition of the brake pads and discs and determinate whenever to propose replacement of either component. Dynamics of wear of brake components on vehicle differ from front or rear axle and inner or outer pad. Correct prediction of service life can reduce maintenance costs and probability of unexpected vehicle breakdown. Service life of the brake components depend on many conditions, such as vehicle model, type of road, style of driving etc. The road conditions in Latvia differ from other European countries with high ratio of unpaved roads. Some of the vehicles sold in Latvia has maximum maintenance periodicity up to 40 000 km but brake pads are wearing out at 30 000 km. Therefore correct model of prediction of <b>brake</b> <b>component</b> wear for local conditions can only be based on data collected from local data sources.

40|$|While modal {{identification}} is a mature subject, very few studies address {{the characterization of}} errors associated with components of a mode shape. This is particularly important in test/analysis correlation procedures, where the Modal Assurance Criterion is used to pair modes and to localize at which sensors discrepancies occur. Poor correlation is usually attributed to modeling errors, but clearly identification errors also occur. In particular with 3 D Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer measurement, many transfer functions are measured. As a result individual validation of each measurement cannot be performed manually in a reasonable time frame and a notable fraction of measurements {{is expected to be}} fairly noisy leading to poor identification of the associated mode shape components. The paper first addresses measurements and introduces multiple criteria. The error measures the difference between test and synthesized transfer functions around each resonance and can be used to localize poorly identified modal components. For intermediate error values, diagnostic of the origin of the error is needed. The level evaluates the transfer function amplitude in the vicinity of a given mode and can be used to eliminate sensors with low responses. A Noise Over Signal indicator, product of error and level, is then shown to be relevant to detect poorly excited modes and errors due to modal property shifts between test batches. Finally, a contribution is introduced to evaluate the visibility of a mode in each transfer. Using tests on a drum <b>brake</b> <b>component,</b> these indicators are shown to provide relevant insight into the quality of measurements. In a second part, test/analysis correlation is addressed with a focus on the localization of sources of poor mode shape correlation. The MACCo algorithm, which sorts sensors by the impact of their removal on a MAC computation, is shown to be particularly relevant. Combined with the error it avoids keeping erroneous modal components. Applied after removal of poor modal components, it provides spatial maps of poor correlation, which help localizing mode shape correlation errors and thus prepare the selection of model changes in updating procedures...|$|E
