50|$|This {{process is}} related to vacuum bag molding {{in exactly the same}} way as it sounds. A solid female mold is used along with a {{flexible}} male mold. The reinforcement is placed inside the female mold with just enough resin to allow the fabric to stick in place (wet lay up). A measured amount of resin is then liberally brushed indiscriminately into the mold and the mold is then clamped to a machine that contains the male flexible mold. The flexible male membrane is then inflated with heated compressed air or possibly steam. The female mold can also be heated. Excess resin is forced out along with trapped air. This process is extensively used in the production of composite helmets due to the lower cost of unskilled labor. Cycle times for a helmet <b>bag</b> <b>moulding</b> machine vary from 20 to 45 minutes, but the finished shells require no further curing if the molds are heated.|$|E
50|$|Vacuum <b>bag</b> <b>moulding</b> uses a {{flexible}} film to enclose the part and seal it from outside air. Vacuum bag material {{is available in}} a tube shape or a sheet of material. A vacuum is then drawn on the vacuum bag and atmospheric pressure compresses the part during the cure. When a tube shaped bag is used, the entire part can be enclosed within the bag. When using sheet bagging materials, {{the edges of the}} vacuum bag are sealed against the edges of the mould surface to enclose the part against an air-tight mould. When bagged in this way, the lower mold is a rigid structure and the upper surface of the part is formed by the flexible membrane vacuum bag. The flexible membrane can be a reusable silicone material or an extruded polymer film. After sealing the part inside the vacuum bag, a vacuum is drawn on the part (and held) during cure. This process can be performed at either ambient or elevated temperature with ambient atmospheric pressure acting upon the vacuum bag. A vacuum pump is typically used to draw a vacuum. An economical method of drawing a vacuum is with a venturi vacuum and air compressor.|$|E

In the present study, the overall mechanical characteristics of bamboo fibres reinforced composites and sandwich for general marine applications were analysed. An accurate analysis of processing possibilities and statements has been conducted, evaluating the relationship between composites performances and processing characteristics. The effectiveness of vacuum <b>bagging</b> and compression <b>moulding</b> processes were analysed. Accurate chemical â€“ physical and mechanical characterizations of bamboo based reinforced resins (epoxy) were conducted, analyzing also the variation of these properties during the materials ageing. Accelerate ageing tests were conducted on bamboo composites and sandwich specimens, obtaining the relationship between materials characteristics and ageing time. Finally, absorption tests (in distillate and sea water) were performed to simulate the effective environment in which bamboo based composites have to be applied, denoting that bamboo composites exhibit excellent resistance to the marine environment and their applications could make good inroads in the marine sector worldwide. As application, a spinnaker pole have been realised and tested under axial compression load...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, due {{to growing}} {{environmental}} awareness, considerable {{attention has been}} given to the development and production of natural fibre reinforced polymer (both thermoset and thermoplastic) composites. The main objective {{of this study was to}} reinforce epoxy and polylactic acid (PLA) with hemp fibre to produce improved composites by optimising the fibre treatment methods, composite processing methods, and fibre/matrix interfacial bonding. An investigation was conducted to obtain a suitable fibre alkali treatment method to: (i) remove non-cellulosic fibre components such as lignin (sensitive to ultra violet (UV) radiation) and hemicelluloses (sensitive to moisture) to improve long term composites stability (ii) roughen fibre surface to obtain mechanical interlocking with matrices (iii) expose cellulose hydroxyl groups to obtain hydrogen and covalent bonding with matrices (iv) separate the fibres from their fibre bundles to make the fibre surface available for bonding with matrices (v) retain tensile strength by keeping fibre damage to a minimum level and (vi) increase crystalline cellulose by better packing of cellulose chains to enhance the thermal stability of the fibres. An empirical model was developed for fibre tensile strength (TS) obtained with different treatment conditions (different sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium sulphite (Na 2 SO 3) concentrations, treatment temperatures, and digestion times) by a partial factorial design. Upon analysis of the alkali fibre treatments by single fibre tensile testing (SFTT), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), zeta potential measurements, differential thermal analysis/thermogravimetric analysis (DTA/TGA), wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXRD), lignin analysis and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, a treatment consisting of 5 wt% NaOH and 2 wt% Na 2 SO 3 concentrations, with a treatment temperature of 120 oC and a digestion time of 60 minutes, was found to give the best combination of the required properties. This alkali treatment produced fibres with an average TS and Young's modulus (YM) of 463 MPa and 33 GPa respectively. The fibres obtained with the optimised alkali treatment were further treated with acetic anhydride and phenyltrimethoxy silane. However, acetylated and silane treated fibres were not found to give overall performance improvement. Cure kinetics of the neat epoxy (NE) and 40 wt% untreated fibre/epoxy (UTFE) composites were studied and it was found that the addition of fibres into epoxy resin increased the reaction rate and decreased the curing time. An increase in the nucleophilic activity of the amine groups in the presence of fibres is believed to have increased the reaction rate of the fibre/epoxy resin system and hence reduced the activation energies compared to NE. The highest interfacial shear strength (IFSS) value for alkali treated fibre/epoxy (ATFE) samples was 5. 2 MPa which was larger than the highest value of 2. 7 MPa for UTFE samples supporting that there was a stronger interface between alkali treated fibre and epoxy resin. The best fibre/epoxy bonding was found for an epoxy to curing agent ratio of 1 : 1 (E 1 C 1) followed by epoxy to curing agent ratios of 1 : 1. 2 (E 1 C 1. 2), 1 : 0. 8 (E 1 C 0. 8), and finally for 1 : 0. 6 (E 1 C 0. 6). Long and short fibre reinforced epoxy composites were produced with various processing conditions using vacuum <b>bag</b> and compression <b>moulding.</b> A 65 wt% untreated long fibre/epoxy (UTLFE) composite produced by compression moulding at 70 oC with a TS of 165 MPa, YM of 17 GPa, flexural strength of 180 MPa, flexural modulus of 10. 1 GPa, impact energy (IE) of 14. 5 kJ/m 2, and fracture toughness (KIc) of 5 MPa. m 1 / 2 was found to be the best in contrast to the trend of increased IFSS for ATFE samples. This is considered to be due to stress concentration as a result of increased fibre/fibre contact with the increased fibre content in the ATFE composites compared to the UTFE composites. Hygrothermal ageing of 65 wt% untreated and alkali treated long and short fibre/epoxy composites (produced by curing at 70 oC) showed that long fibre/epoxy composites were more resistant than short fibre/epoxy composites and ATFE composites were more resistant than UTFE composites towards hygrothermal ageing environments as revealed from diffusion coefficients and tensile, flexural, impact, fracture toughness, SEM, TGA, and WAXRD test results. Accelerated ageing of 65 wt% UTLFE and alkali treated long fibre/epoxy (ATLFE) composites (produced by curing at 70 oC) showed that ATLFE composites were more resistant than UTLFE composites towards hygrothermal ageing environments as revealed from tensile, flexural, impact, KIc, SEM, TGA, WAXRD, FTIR test results. IFSS obtained with untreated fibre/PLA (UFPLA) and alkali treated fibre/PLA (ATPLA) samples showed that ATPLA samples had greater IFSS than that of UFPLA samples. The increase in the formation of hydrogen bonding and mechanical interlocking of the alkali treated fibres with PLA could be responsible for the increased IFSS for ATPLA system compared to UFPLA system. Long and short fibre reinforced PLA composites were also produced with various processing conditions using compression moulding. A 32 wt% alkali treated long fibre PLA composite produced by film stacking with a TS of 83 MPa, YM of 11 GPa, flexural strength of 143 MPa, flexural modulus of 6. 5 GPa, IE of 9 kJ/m 2, and KIc of 3 MPa. m 1 / 2 was found to be the best. This could be due to the better bonding of the alkali treated fibres with PLA. The mechanical properties of this composite have been found to be the best compared to the available literature. Hygrothermal and accelerated ageing of 32 wt% untreated and alkali treated long fibre/PLA composites ATPLA composites were more resistant than UFPLA composites towards hygrothermal and accelerated ageing environments as revealed from diffusion coefficients and tensile, flexural, impact, KIc, SEM, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), WAXRD, and FTIR results. Increased potential hydrogen bond formation and mechanical interlocking of the alkali treated fibres with PLA could be responsible for the increased resistance of the ATPLA composites. Based on the present study, it can be said that the performance of natural fibre composites largely depend on fibre properties (e. g. length and orientation), matrix properties (e. g. cure kinetics and crystallinity), fibre treatment and processing methods, and composite processing methods...|$|R

40|$|The cohort {{consisted}} of 15, 908 {{men and women}} who worked for at least six months between 1948 and 1977 in 30 participating manufacturing plants in the reinforced plastics and composites industry. These workers were occupationally exposed to the working environment in the industry, which included exposure to styrene. Cause specific mortality analyses were performed based on the standardised mortality ratio (SMR) with the United States population as a comparison. No significant excess of cause specific mortality was found for the total cohort. Mortality from cancer was slightly less than expected (SMR = 88. 1). For cancer of the respiratory system, a small non-significant excess was detected (SMR = 116. 1). For lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer, a non-significant deficit was found (SMR = 73. 3). The observed mortality from leukaemia was similar to that expected (five observed v 4. 76 expected deaths). The plants with hot processes (injection moulding, centrifugal casting, compression moulding, continuous lamination, and pultrusion) experienced a significantly increased SMR (177. 9) for respiratory cancer, which was more than twice that (78. 3) for those with cold processes (resin mixing, lay up and spray up, <b>bag</b> <b>moulding,</b> and filament winding). As potential exposure to styrene from hot processes is considerably less than that from the cold processes, this finding could not be attributed to occupational exposures. A subsequent nested case-control study consisting of 40 cases of deaths from respiratory cancer was conducted. Further information on detailed work history, occupational exposures, and smoking history was collected. The case-control study did not show any significant association between respiratory cancer and direct exposure to styrene (contained in polyester resins), duration of exposure to styrene, the type of process (hot or cold), or whether a resin was used. A statistically significant association (relative risk = 7. 33) was found between cigarette smoking and respiratory cancer among the study subjects...|$|E
