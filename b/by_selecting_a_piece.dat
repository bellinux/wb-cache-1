5000|$|Dio Chrysostom, in {{a speech}} on ideal kingship {{addressed}} to Trajan, refers {{to the story of}} how Timotheus' music inspired martial thoughts in Alexander. For Chrysostom, Timotheus's skill was in [...] "adapting his playing to the king's character <b>by</b> <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> that was not languishing or slow nor of the kind that would cause relaxation or listlessness, but rather, I fancy, the ringing strain which bears Athena's name and none other." [...] Other rulers, such as Sardanapalus who was of languid temperament, would not have responded to such music, but being of a highly volatile nature, Alexander did.|$|E

During his episode, he both gave some insights into his personal life and played piano to four individual mental hospital patients, all dealing with their own mental health issues, inside their psychiatric hospital <b>by</b> <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> for each of them to match their personalities and individual circumstances, ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{closely resembles}} that of the original source material. Players begin <b>by</b> <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> game <b>piece,</b> each modeled after famous Star Wars characters. Playable characters consist of Han Solo, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, R2-D2, Chewbacca, Darth Vader, Boba Fett and Stormtrooper. Whilst the game pieces appear to be cast metal during piece selection, during gameplay they are fully animated and are textured to look like their film counterparts. Players can choose up to four players, with up to three AI players if a person wishes to play solo. Several options allow players to customize the game to their preferences. C-3P0 servers as narrator for the game, voiced by Anthony Daniels.|$|R

50|$|C. Now the {{trimmings}} are divided. Assume w.l.o.g. that #3 {{took the}} trimmed piece. We use Austin's procedure {{again with the}} trimmings and partners #4 and #1, to create 4 pieces each of which equals exactly 1/4 for both of them. Since partners #1 and #2 have an irrevocable advantage over whoever partner that took the trimmed piece, we can let #3 {{be the first to}} <b>select</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> from the trimming, then #2, then #4 and #1.|$|R

5000|$|The show {{traditionally}} asks its {{guests to}} <b>select</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> to perform from a composer of their choice; Deutscher {{opted for the}} German composer Eduard Marxsen, who was the teacher of young Johannes Brahms, and whom Vardi said he'd [...] "never heard of". Deutscher explained that she felt sorry for Marxsen as a long-forgotten composer. After listening to Deutscher perform a sonata by Domenico Scarlatti, Vardi commented that she played Scarlatti's music {{as though she had}} written it.|$|R

Students were to <b>select</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> they had written, the pieces were judged and the best 100 were {{selected}} {{for inclusion in the}} anthology. Print on demand classroom publishing means that students thoughts and opinions can be heard. One student wrote that, [...] "... “It’s easy to write when you have a purpose.

50|$|Like {{many types}} of European folk dance and country-western line dancing in the U.S., each Israeli folk dance has a fixed choreography (sequence of steps) and is danced to <b>a</b> {{specific}} <b>piece</b> of music. The yotzer, or choreographer, <b>selects</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of music, usually {{from one of the}} genres of Israeli music, and arranges a set of steps to fit with that music. The formation of the dance might be a circle, couples, trios, or short lines, as well as a group/line formation as in country-western line dancing.|$|R

40|$|This paper reviews all the {{published}} {{evidence on the}} theory that the act of <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of food or drink structurally coordinates quantitative information across several sensory modalities. The existing data show that the momentary disposition to consume the item is strengthened or weakened by learnt configurations of stimuli perceived through both exteroceptive and interoceptive senses. The observed configural structure of performance shows that the multimodal stimuli are interacting perceptually, rather than merely combining quantities of information from the senses into the observed response...|$|R
5000|$|The {{piece was}} remembered fondly by some Savoyards. In 1906, as a {{professor}} of singing and stage manager at the Royal College of Music, Richard Temple was asked to direct a work from his earlier career for the first performance of the Cambridge University Operatic Club, at the Scala Theatre. He was asked to <b>select</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> [...] "from which students would learn the craft of worthwhile light opera." [...] Instead of choosing The Mikado or The Yeomen of the Guard, for instance, he chose Mirette.|$|R

60|$|When he had {{finished}} he <b>selected</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of meat weighing a hundred pounds, and started to drag {{it down to the}} tent. But the snow was soft, and it was too much for him. He exchanged it for <b>a</b> twenty-pound <b>piece,</b> and, with many pauses to rest, succeeded in getting it to the tent. He fried some of the meat, but ate sparingly. Then, and automatically, he went out to his crouching place on the bank. There were sled-tracks in the fresh snow on the trail. The sled-load of life had passed by while he had been cutting up the moose.|$|R
