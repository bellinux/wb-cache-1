5|$|Maurice <b>Binder</b> {{was hired}} to design the title sequence, and was {{involved}} in a dispute with Eon Production to have his name credited in the film. As Thunderball was the first James Bond film shot in Panavision, <b>Binder</b> had to reshoot the iconic gun barrel scene which permitted him to not only incorporate pinhole photographic techniques to shoot inside a genuine gun barrel, but also made Connery appearing in the sequence {{for the first time a}} reality, as stunt man Bob Simmons had doubled for him in the three previous films. <b>Binder</b> gained access to the tank at Pinewood which he used to film the silhouetted title girls who appeared naked in the opening sequence, which was the first time actual nudity (although concealed) had ever been seen in a Bond film.|$|E

5|$|Parts {{can be made}} by hot {{pressing}} from four commercial grades of h-BN. Grade HBN contains a boron oxide binder; it is usable up to 550–850°C in oxidizing atmosphere and up to 1600°C in vacuum, but due to the boron oxide content is sensitive to water. Grade HBR uses a calcium borate <b>binder</b> and is usable at 1600°C. Grades HBC and HBT contain no <b>binder</b> and can be used up to 3000°C.|$|E

5|$|Glue <b>binder</b> {{was often}} used as an {{inexpensive}} alternative to oil. Many works using this medium were produced but few survive today because of the delicateness of the linen cloth and the solubility of the hide glue from which the <b>binder</b> was derived. Well known and relatively well preserved – though substantially damaged – examples include Matsys' Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine (c.1415–25) and Bouts' Entombment (c.1440–55). The paint was generally applied with brushes or sometimes with thin sticks or brush handles. The artists often softened the contours of shadows with their fingers, at times to blot or reduce the glaze.|$|E

40|$|Waterproof gypsum <b>binders</b> - gypsum <b>binders,</b> able {{to harden}} in a moist environment. They {{are used in}} a wide range of {{construction}} and installation works, from conventional plasters to their incorporation into waterproof concrete and mortar. Water adversely affects gypsum <b>binders.</b> When applied and operated, even in a humid environment, a significant reduction in strength and adhesion characteristics is observed. The ability of water-resistant gypsum <b>binders</b> to permanent exposures to the destructive properties of water and aqueous solutions is a distinctive feature, compared to conventional gypsum <b>binders.</b> With the growth in demand for such materials, the price of raw materials for production increases. This problem is solved by the use of industrial waste with a high content of gypsum.
