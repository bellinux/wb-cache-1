This paper introduces an innovative framework for process-related risk management and describes a working implementation realized by extending the YAWL system. The framework covers three aspects of risk management: risk monitoring, risk prevention, and risk mitigation. Risk monitoring functionality is provided using a sensor-based architecture, where sensors are defined at design time and used at run-time for monitoring purposes. Risk prevention functionality is provided {{in the form of}} suggestions about what should be executed, by who, and how, through the use of decision trees. Finally, risk mitigation functionality is provided as <b>a</b> sequence <b>of</b> remedial actions (e. g. reallocating, skipping, rolling <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> work <b>item)</b> that should be executed to restore the process to a normal situation...|$|R

40|$|There {{is nothing}} {{absolute}} in this world. However, this study could prove that vagueness is inherit {{in the nature}} of language. Vagueness exists in today's newspapers. Concerning this situation and so far there has been no thesis discussing vagueness in newspapers, the researcher could find that vagueness in newspapers is an interesting topic to be further discussed. Moreover, vagueness in newspapers can be used as an instrument to determine the quality of the newspapers. Vagueness is considered as an uncertain, unclear, or imprecise thing which is lack of specification. Moreover, vagueness should be avoided in communicating news since its existence causes misunderstanding among the readers. Driven by her curiousity to know more about vagueness in the writing of news, the researcher formulated two questions, "What kinds of vagueness are found in politics, social-affairs, and economics news in the first pages of Jawa Pos newspaper during the May- 2000 edition?, and, "How is the quality of Jawa Pos newspaper on May- 2000 in terms of writing politics, social-affairs, and economics news in the first pages viewed from the four kinds of vagueness?, as the research questions of the study. According to Kempson in Semantic Theory, there are four kinds of vagueness, namely referential vagueness, indeterminacy of the meaning <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> or phrase, lack of specification in the meaning <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item,</b> and the meaning <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> involves the disjunction of different interpretations. Depending on these kinds of vagueness, the researcher could find kinds <b>of</b> vagueness in <b>a</b> newspaper and judge its quality concerning its ability avoiding vagueness. In line with this case, this study analyzed the news on politics, social-affairs, and economics of the first pages of Jawa Pos newspaper during the edition of May 2000, to find the vagueness contained in the news and to judge the quality of the newspaper under study. The vagueness found was then categorized into referential vagueness, indeterminacy of the meaning <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> or phrase, lack of specification in the meaning <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item,</b> and the meaning <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> involves the disjunction of different interpretations. After that, the researcher count the percentage of the quality that Jawa Pos acquired. The lower the precentage is, the better the quality of Jawa Pos newspaper would be. The analysis on the news found that there were three kinds of vagueness in the news. They were indeterminacy of the meaning <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> or phrase, lack of specification in the meaning <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item,</b> and the meaning <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> involves the disjunction of different interpretations. Out of the 198 news under sudy, only eight of them contained vagueness. There were 2 times of occurrence in the vagueness of indeterminacy of the meaning <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> or phrase, 4 times of occurrence in the vagueness of lack of specification in the meaning <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item,</b> and 2 times of occurrence in the vagueness of the meaning <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> involves the disjunction of different interpretations.

We handle the Gaussian-Categorical non-conjugacy using a stick-breaking formulation coupled with Pólya-Gamma auxiliary variable augmentation for a simple, fully Bayesian inference. On two real world datasets, we demonstrate the predictive ability of our model and its effectiveness in learning explainable user biases to provide insights towards a more reliable product quality estimation.

40|$|Abstract. A Bloom filter {{has been}} widely {{utilized}} to represent <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> <b>items</b> {{because it is a}} simple space-efficient randomized data structure. In this paper, we propose a new structure to support the representation of items with multiple attributes based on Bloom filters. The structure is composed of Parallel Bloom Filters (PBF) and a hash table to support the accurate and efficient representation and query of items. The PBF is a counter-based matrix and consists of multiple submatrixes. Each submatrix can store one attribute <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item.</b> The hash table as an auxiliary structure captures <b>a</b> verification value <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item,</b> which can reflect the inherent dependency of all attributes for the item. Because the correct query <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> with multiple attributes becomes complicated, we use a two-step verification process to ensure the presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> particular <b>item</b> to reduce false positive probability. ...|$|R
