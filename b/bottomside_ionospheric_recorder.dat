Regional ionospheric models, e.g. TEC prediction models and the South African <b>Bottomside</b> <b>Ionospheric</b> Model (SABIM), take into account the local magnetic conditions by using the a index, which are directly derived from the locally recorded K index (Habarulema 2010; McKinnell 2002). An accurate model to predict the local storm time K index might, therefore, make a significant contribution towards improving ionospheric and other regional space weather models that consider magnetic activity as input.|$|R

GPS radio {{occultation}} measurements on board low Earth orbiting satellites can provide vertical electron density {{profiles of the}} ionosphere from satellite orbit heights down to the <b>bottomside.</b> <b>Ionospheric</b> {{radio occultation}} (IRO) measurements carried out onboard the German CHAMP satellite mission since 11 April 2001 were used to derive vertical electron density profiles (EDPs) on a routine basis. About 150 vertical electron density profiles may be retrieved per day thus providing a huge data basis for testing and developing ionospheric models. Although the validation of the EDP retrievals is not yet completed, the paper addresses a systematic comparison of about 78 000 electron density pro- files derived from CHAMP IRO data with the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI 2001). The results are discussed for quite different geophysical conditions, e. g. {{as a function of}} latitude, local time and geomagnetic activity. The comparison of IRO data with corresponding IRI data indicates that IRI generally overestimates {{the upper part of the}} ionosphere whereas it underestimates the lower part of the ionosphere under high solar activity conditions. In a first order correction this systematic deviation could be compensated by introducing a height dependence correction factor in IRI profiling...|$|R

We investigated the eclipse area in Taiwan, using an ionosonde and {{global positioning system}} (GPS) satellite measurements. The measurements of fo F 2, hm F 2, bottomside scale height around the peak height (H m), and slab thickness (B 0) were collected at the ionosonde station at Chung-Li Observatory. In addition, we calculated the total electron content (TEC) to study the differences {{inside and outside the}} eclipse area, using 3 receivers located at Marzhu (denoted as MATZ), Hsinchu (TNML), and Henchun (HENC). The results showed that the fo F 2 values gradually decreased when the annularity began and reached a minimum level of approximately 2. 0 MHz at 06 : 30 LT. The hm F 2 immediately decreased and then increased during the annular eclipse period. The TEC variations also appeared to deplete {{in the path of the}} eclipse and opposite the outside passing area. Further, the rate of change of the TEC values (dTEC / d t measured for 15 min) was examined to study the wave-like fluctuations. The scale height near the F 2 layer peak height (H m) also decreased and then increased during the eclipse period.

The objective has been modelling the <b>bottomside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> characteristics using neural networks. The use of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data is described as a new technique to monitor the dynamics and variations of the ionosphere over South Africa, with possible future application in high frequency radio communication. For this task, the University of New Brunswick Ionospheric Modelling Technique (UNB-IMT) was applied to compute midday (10 : 00 UT) GNSS-derived total electron content (GTEC). GTEC values were computed using GNSS data for stations located near ionosondes for the years 2002 and 2005 near solar maximum and minimum, respectively. The GTEC was compared with the midday ionosonde-derived TEC (ITEC) measurements to validate the UNB-IMT results. It was found that the variation trends of GTEC and ITEC over all stations are in good agreement and show a pronounced seasonal variation for the period near solar maximum, with maximum values (80 TECU) around autumn and spring equinoxes, and minimum values (22 TECU) around winter and summer. Furthermore, the residual ΔTEC = GTEC − ITEC was computed. It was evident that ΔTEC, which is believed to correspond to plasmaspheric electron content, showed a pronounced seasonal variation with maximum values (20 TECU) around equinoxes and minimum (5 TECU) around winter near solar maximum.

Under the assumption of spherical symmetry at the locality of the occultation, the dual-band phase data have been processed to yield ray-path bending angle profiles, which have then been used to yield profiles of refractive index via the Abel integral transform. The refractivity profiles can then, in turn, yield profiles of ionospheric electron density and other atmospheric variables such as neutral atmospheric density, pressure, and temperature in the stratosphere and upper troposphere, and water vapor in the lower troposphere {{with the aid of}} independent temperature data. To approach a near real-time process, electron density profiles can also be derived by the Abel transform through the computation of total electron content (TEC) assuming straight-line propagation (neglecting bending). In order to assess the accuracy of the GPS/MET ionospheric electron density retrievals, coincidences of ionosonde data with GPS/MET occultations have been examined. The retrieved electron density profiles from GPS/MET TEC observations have been compared with ionogram inversion results derived from digital ionospheric sounders operated by the National Central University (the Chung-Li digisonde; 24.6 °N, 121.0 °E) and by Utah State University (the Bear-Lake dynasonde; 41.9 °N, 111.4 °W).

40|$|Ionospheric {{scale height}} {{is a measure}} of the topside {{altitude}} dependence of electron density and is a key ionospheric parameter due to its intrinsic connection to ionospheric dynamics, plasma temperature, and composition. A longtime problem has been that information on the <b>bottomside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> profile is readily available, but the observation of the topside ionosphere is still challenging. Despite numerous data techniques to characterize the topside ionosphere, the knowledge of the behavior of the topside ionosphere and its subsequent scale heights remains insufficient. The goal of this study is to evaluate whether or not we can characterize the topside ionospheric density and temperature profiles in the event that neither temperature nor electron density are measured by using a cost-effective method. In a simple model, the electron density in the F-region topside decreases exponentially with height. This exponential decay is mainly driven by thermal diffusive equilibrium, but also dependent on the dominant ion species, as well as other drivers during nondiffusive conditions. A scale height based on observations of the temperature can generate topside electron density profiles. While a measure of the electron density profile enables a scale height to be inferred, hence yielding temperature information. We found a new way to represent how much total electron content (TEC) is allotted for the topside ionosphere. We then used this information to successfully determine TEC using ionosonde data containing only bottomside electron density information. For the first time, slab thickness, which is directly proportional to scale height, was found to be correlated to the peak density height and introduced as a new index, k. Ultimately, k relates electron density parameters and can be a very useful tool for describing the topside ionosphere shape and subsequently, scale height. The methodology of using cost-effective, readily available ionosonde bottomside electron density data combined with GPS TEC was discovered to be capable of inferring the topside ionosphere. This was verified by incoherent scatter radar (ISR) data, though major issues surrounding the availability of ionogram data during nighttime hours greatly limited our study, especially during diffusive equilibrium conditions. Also, significant differences were found between ISR and ionosonde-determined peak density parameters, NmF 2 and hmF 2, and raised concerns in how the instruments were calibrated...|$|R

TEC {{is defined as the}} integral of the electron density along the satellite-receiver signal path. Electron density profiles can be determined from these TEC values using ionospheric tomographic inversion techniques such as Multi-Instrument Data Analysis System (MIDAS). This thesis reports on a study aimed at evaluating the suitability of ionospheric tomography as a tool to derive one-dimensional electron density profiles, using the MIDAS inversion algorithm over Grahamstown, South Africa (33. 30 � S, 26. 50 � E). The evaluation was done by using ionosonde data from the Louisvale (28. 50 � S, 21. 20 � E) and Madimbo (22. 40 � S, 30. 90 � E) stations to create empirical orthonormal functions (EOFs). These EOFs were used by MIDAS in the inversion process to describe the vertical variation of the electron density. Profiles derived from the MIDAS algorithm were compared with profiles obtained from the international Reference Ionosphere (IRI) 2001 model and with ionosonde profiles from the Grahamstown ionosonde station. The optimised MIDAS profiles show a good agreement with the Grahamstown ionosonde profiles. The South African <b>Bottomside</b> <b>Ionospheric</b> Model (SABIM) was used to set the limits within which MIDAS was producing accurate peak electron density (NmF 2) values and to define accuracy in this project, with the understanding that the national model (SABIM) is currently the best model for the Grahamstown region. Analysis show that MIDAS produces accurate results during the winter season, which had the lowest root mean square (rms) error of 0. 37 × 1011 [e/m 3] and an approximately 86 % chance of producing NmF 2 closer to the actual NmF 2 value than the national model SABIM. MIDAS was found to also produce accurate NmF 2 values at 12 h 00 UT, where an approximately 88 % chance of producing an accurate NmF 2 value, which may deviate from the measured value by 0. 72 × 1011 [e/m 3], was determined. In conclusion, ionospheric tomographic inversion techniques show promise in the reconstruction of electron density profiles over South Africa, and are worth pursuing further in the future. ...|$|R

The intense Doppler velocities of the coherent echoes indicate that the polarization electric field is generated inside the TIDs. We consider that the horizontal gradient of the electric conductivity associated by TIDs and the vertical gradient of the conductivity on the bottomside of the F-region ionosphere generates the 3 -m scale irregularities through the gradient-drift instability process. The anti-correlation of the occurrence rate of the F-region field-aligned irregularities to the solar activity would be caused by the anti-correlation of the amplitude of TIDs and of the vertical gradient of the Pedersen conductivity.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{principal}} contributions of Rao in the academic field was {{the establishment of a}} laboratory for Ionosphere and Space Research (ISRL) at the Waltair campus of Andhra University which would evolve into an advanced space science centre, and it was here, he hosted a number of researchers. He was also instrumental in introducing computer at the university. He maintained his interest in ultrasonics which he had worked on during his doctoral studies and his initial work at ISRL led to the discovery that diffraction patterns followed Braggs Law in high frequency regions. For furthering their research, the team led by him developed novel methodologies for measuring ultrasonic velocities in liquids and solids with high precision and developed purpose-built instruments such as transmitters, receivers and oscillographs for pulse measurement, seismic sounders and satellite signal recorders. He designed a multi-frequency HF phase path radar which was the first equipment of its kind that used spaced-receiver configuration. The other equipment developed by his team included an HF phase path sounder which was a first time development, as well as an <b>ionospheric</b> drift <b>recorder,</b> a meteor radar and a SOnic Detection And Ranging system (SODAR). He and his colleagues published seven articles detailing the body of their work in ultrasonics and six of them appeared in Nature. This pioneering research on ionospheric plasma contributed to the development of HF Doppler radar, meteor radar and SODAR systems presently in use. He also carried out studies on Ionospheric dynamo region and on the horizontal winds over a sunspot cycle. His studies have been documented by way of a number of articles of which many have been listed by the article repository of the Indian Academy of Sciences. He also edited three books, Physics of the solid state : commemoration volume to Professor S. Bhagavantam, and Bhagavantam Volume: Volume in Honour of Prof. S. Bhagavantam on the Occasion of the 60th Birthday, 14.04.1969 both festschrifts on his mentor, as well as Science, Technology and Education for Prosperity, and his work has drawn citations in books published by others.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{seasonal}} {{changes in the}} diurnal variation of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>bottomside</b> slab thickness (B 0), based on observations during high solar activities at the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) area station of Chung-Li (121. 1 ° E, 24. 9 ° N), Taiwan. The data examined in this investigation are derived from ionograms recorded at Chung-Li in 1999, and are compared with International Reference Ionosphere (IRI- 2007) model values. In our data set B 0 shows largest values and biggest changes during the daytime (06 : 00 – 12 : 00 LT) particularly in the summer. Moreover, the diurnal variation of B 0 shows an abnormal peak during the pre-sunrise period, especially in the winter. The variation in the F-peak height (hmF 2) is related to a thermospheric wind traveling toward the equator, which also enhances B 0 during the pre-sunrise period. The results of the comparison with the IRI model show that B 0 is overestimated, in both the B 0 -table and the Gulyaeva option, after noon LT in the equinox (B 0 -table and Gulyaeva average values for the overestimation are 11 and 47 km, respectively) and summer (B 0 -table and Gulyaeva average values for the overestimation are 23 and 71 km, respectively) periods. Furthermore, the modeled values are underestimated at approximately 31 and 14 km for the table and Gulyaeva option during the daytime in the winter, respectively. The F 2 -layer maximum electron density (NmF 2) data show reasonably favorable agreement with the model for a high correlation coefficient of approximately 0. 97, with the major difference observed at approximately noon in the equinox and winter seasons. Regarding the hmF 2 data, the model shows agreement with the observed values, and the largest discrepancy (average value is 39 km) was observed {{in the summer and}} the smallest (average value is 11 km) in the equinox season. This paper provides a comprehensive discussion on the relationship among B 0, the NmF 2 and the hmF 2 for geomagnetic storm events...|$|R
