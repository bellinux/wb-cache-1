5000|$|In the United States, a {{pilot of}} a hot air balloon must have a pilot {{certificate}} from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and it must carry the rating of [...] "Lighter-than-air free balloon", and unless the pilot is also qualified to fly gas balloons, will also carry this limitation: [...] "Limited to hot air balloons with airborne heater". A pilot does not need a license to fly an ultralight aircraft, but training is highly advised, and some hot air <b>balloons</b> <b>meet</b> the criteria.|$|R
50|$|In Falling Upwards: How We Took to the Air (2013), Richard Holmes {{approaches}} {{the history of}} ballooning by presenting biographies of French, English, and American balloonists. The personalities and experiences of those involved are varied and surprising. Balloons were used successfully to send information out of besieged Paris in 1870, and unsuccessfully to fly to the North Pole in the 1890s, to name only two examples. In Holmes' history of <b>ballooning,</b> science <b>meets</b> showmanship and both literary flights and actual adventures capture the imagination.|$|R
2500|$|... 22 July 1980 – Balloon trams 705 and 706 {{collided}} head-on on {{the turning}} loop at the Pleasure Beach. 705 was bound for Starr Gate whilst 706 was stationary on the loop. 705 {{was on the}} wrong line due to the points being incorrectly set and ran into 706, about to depart for Fleetwood. Both trams were severely damaged; 705 was scrapped, the only <b>Balloon</b> to <b>meet</b> this fate until 2009 when 722 was scrapped due to collision damage. 706 was rebuilt as an open-topped Balloon. A County Court judgement in 1982 found that Blackpool Corporation were 80% to blame for the collision.|$|R
50|$|Anteojito and Antifaz {{live in an}} {{apartment}} house in Villa Trompeta, a fantasy city with funny animals, dancing vegetables, and Uncle Antifaz’s enemy, Cachavacha the witch, living with Pajarraco her owl, in the apartment right under his. Uncle Antifaz tries to invent an invisibility formula with Anteojito’s help, and Cachavacha tries to steal it. Anteojito sells some <b>balloons,</b> <b>meets</b> his friend, Buzoncito the little red mailbox, and the balloons escape when he argues with some brats. The circus comes to town and he helps out Castañazo, a friendly clown, and his sick daughter Loli by posing as a second, singing, clown. The con men Bodego and Rapiño are impressed by Anteojito’s singing and pose as talent agents who can get him lucrative theatrical and operatic engagements. Bonaño, a good-natured cat (tall with funny hat), takes him to Meethoven, a Beethovenesque feline music teacher. Anteojito becomes a star. He lets success go to his head, snubs Uncle Antifaz, and dismisses Bodego and Rapiño. The distraught Antifaz gives up his experiments, which are immediately continued disastrously by Cachavacha, who utimatilly dies on an explosion. Anteojito is told a story within the film (based on a separate book by Ferré, El Pararrayos o Historia de una Ambición) and at last realizes that wealth is worthless without true friendship. He returns to being a little boy living with Uncle Antifaz, who throws away the invisibility formula he has finally invented.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a new angioplasty balloon from a new material can be a long and arduous process that may take months. These <b>balloons</b> must <b>meet</b> some very stringent requirements such as high rated burst pressure with minimal wall thickness. The purpose of this thesis is to help reduce the amount of time invested in the experimental development stages of these medical balloons. This can be achieved {{with the aid of a}} cycle-to-cycle controller. The controller presented here may be simplistic, but it has shown that with further testing and modeling, it has the potential to completely replace the trial-and-error method of balloon development in use today...|$|R
50|$|The {{completed}} Aero-Bus lifts off {{to great}} acclaim, though it meets with two difficulties; first the suffragette leader tries to board with the expedition {{at the last}} moment, and then the explorer Tching-Tchun, arriving late, is accidentally left behind. The race to the Pole attracts many other adventurers, who depart in their own machines; soon the sky is full of aircraft of every shape and size. Both Tching-Tchun and the suffragette leader attempt {{to make it to}} the Pole in a <b>balloon,</b> but again <b>meet</b> with failure. (The explorer falls a short distance to the ground and gives up; the suffragette, having held on longer, falls onto a church steeple and explodes.) Meanwhile, the Aero-Bus continues through the sky unimpeded, passing various planets and constellations.|$|R
25|$|Observation planes often {{operated}} individually, as did pursuit {{pilots to}} attack a <b>balloon</b> or to <b>meet</b> the enemy in a dogfight. However the tendency was toward formation flying, for pursuit {{as well as for}} bombardment operations, as a defensive tactic. The dispersal of squadrons among the army ground units (each corps and division had an observation squadron attached) made coordination of air activities difficult, so that squadrons were organized by functions into groups, the first of these being the I Corps Observation Group, organized in April 1918 to patrol the Toul Sector between Flirey and Apremont in support of the U.S. 26th Division. On May 5, 1918, the 1st Pursuit Group was formed, and by the armistice the AEF had 14 heavier-than-air groups (7 observation, 5 pursuit, and 2 bombardment). Of these 14 groups, only the 1st Pursuit and 1st Day Bombardment Groups had their lineage continued into the post-war Air Service. In July 1918 the AEF organized its first wing formation, the 1st Pursuit Wing, made up of the 2d Pursuit, 3rd Pursuit, and 1st Day Bombardment Groups.|$|R
40|$|The experiential work Super K Sonic Booooum imagines what {{it would}} be like to see sub-atomic {{particles}} slam together at high speed and to experience a SONIC BOOUM (when a particle is traveling faster than the speed of light). Offering a glimpse into the world of particle physics, Nelly Ben Hayoun created a super-sized version of a Japanese neutrino observatory, where electrons and neutrinos, a type of fundamental particles that make up the universe, collide to create giant Sonic Boum. Physicists actively participate in the work. On entering the installation, visitors put on helmets, white rubber shoes and boiler suits. They then board dinghies that transport them through a space filled with water and covered with silver <b>balloons</b> where they <b>meet</b> the Nobel Prize Physics winner inside a boat. There, they experienced a light show and a sonic explosion designed by sound artist Tim Holden in partnership with Particle Physicist at Imperial College. Super K Sonic Booooum is based and developed in collaboration with the scientific team of the Super Kamiokande experiment. Super Kamiokande is one of only a few neutrino observatories in the world. It is located a kilometre underneath Kamioka mountain in Japan and consists of a cylindrical steel tank,about 40 m in diameter, filled with 50, 000 tons of ultra-pure water, and lined with 11, 146 hand blown glass photomultiplier tubes. Experiments like the Super Kamiokande are Physicists’ attempt to see into the dimensions that are inaccessible to us, to expand the horizon of our understanding of matter...|$|R
