50|$|The Vijayadashami day is {{the tenth}} and {{final day of the}} Navratri celebrations, and is {{considered}} auspicious for <b>beginning</b> <b>learning</b> in any field. The process of learning and initiation on this day is also closely related to the Ayudha Puja ritual. It is usually on Vijayadashami that the implements kept for puja are taken up again for re-use. This is also considered a day when the Goddess of learning, Saraswati, and teachers (gurus) must be revered by giving Gurudakshina. This usually consists of a betel leaf, Areca nut, along with a small token of money and a new piece of clothing - a dhoti, mundu or saree.|$|E
50|$|Whereas at the <b>beginning</b> <b>learning</b> {{involves}} only basic conditioning, as repertories are {{acquired the}} child's learning improves, being {{aided by the}} repertoires that are already functional. The way a person experiences the world depends on his/her repertoires. The individual's environment to the present results in learning a basic behavioral repertoire (BBR). The individual's behavior is function of the life situation and the individual's BBR. The BBRs are both a dependent and an independent variable, as they result from learning and cause behavior, constituting the individual's personality. According to this theory, biological conditions of learning are essential. Biology provides the mechanisms for learning and performance of behavior. For example, a severely brain-damaged child will not learn BBRs in a normal manner.|$|E
5000|$|Sam Chien {{can also}} be said to allow {{development}} of the eight Five Ancestor principles and so, is considered the most important form in the style. Indeed, {{it is said that}} this form contains all the principles of the Five Ancestors system. Thus it is the first form taught to junior students, so that they may explore the essential points of Five Ancestors from the start of their training. With the practitioner's progress in understanding the essence of Sam Chien, all of their movements are immediately improved as a consequence. Thus, it is a strong adage believed by senior/master level practitioners that, without the most basic essential understanding of Sam Chien, all of the fighting forms are rendered as much less effective. Fighting forms are relatively uncomplicated, but have a heavy reliance on one's Sam Chien evolving understanding. Thus, Sam Chien keeps being practiced even by those who are very senior in the arts: [...] "Since the <b>beginning</b> <b>learning</b> Sam Chien. Until pass away keeps learning Sam Chien." [...] The writer here can't emphasize enough that junior practitioners see {{how important it is to}} keep training Sam Chien while progressing to learn different forms at the same time. It looks and feels boring, but without it a Wuzuquan practitioner is nothing.|$|E

5000|$|Amina began {{studying}} {{music as a}} child, <b>beginning</b> <b>learning</b> the piano, and expanding into musical composition and arrangement as she matured. Figarova attended the Baku Conservatory, where she studied to be a classical concert pianist while {{a young girl in}} Azerbaijan. This was followed by a course of study in jazz performance at the Rotterdam Conservatory before entering and completing her studies at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts.She has toured extensively, developing a tight-knit ensemble that, despite inevitable personnel changes, has attained a distinctive and inimitable voice by concentrating on all-original repertoire for almost 18 years. During that period, having collaborated with musicians residing in both the U.S. and Europe and having built up a circuit of welcoming venues, the Amina Figarova Sextet has triumphed at the main stage of the Newport Jazz Festival, been invited repeatedly to New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, won critical and audience acclaim in Chicago, Detroit, Paris, Amsterdam — and of course New York. Amina's pieces strike a perfect tone, employing genuinely beautiful harmonizations, to capture fleeting thoughts that accompany those precious moments when the puzzling jostle of daily existence comes into unexpected but deeply satisfying sync.Figarova's 12th album, titled Twelve was her debut release on the renowned independent German label In + Out. The album celebrates jazz as an international music and New York City as a locale where [...] "jazz gypsies" [...] may feel most at home. Twelve is suffused with the heightened expectations, sense of adventure and fresh perceptions, as well as the confidence, creative energies and nuanced fulfilment that artists gain from being {{in the right place at}} the right time.|$|E
