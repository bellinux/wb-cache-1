[...] Roosevelt disliked the work, and engaged Saint-Gaudens to design an unofficial medal commemorating the inauguration. [...] Saint-Gaudens foresaw resistance from Barber {{on the question}} of the new coinage; he wrote to his brother, Louis Saint-Gaudens, [...] "Barber is a S.O.A.B.

500|$|Smith's {{first film}} role came in Heaven Help Us (1985). She then played Putter in The Legend of Billie Jean (also 1985). The film was a box office bomb and {{critically}} panned, although Smith [...] "thought {{it would be}} the movie that launched my career. And then it was out at the box office about 10 days before it died." [...] When filming was over, she rejoined The Real Thing before being out of work for six months. Smith worried her career was over. However, the following year, she played Connie in Stephen King's Maximum Overdrive (1986), noting it was [...] "truly a dreadful film, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> great part in it." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 30, Chandler brought Hendrix to the London Polytechnic at Regent Street, where Cream was {{scheduled}} to perform, and where Hendrix and Eric Clapton met. Clapton later commented: [...] "He {{asked if he could}} play a couple of numbers. I said, 'Of course', <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> funny feeling about him." [...] Halfway through Cream's set, Hendrix took the stage and performed a frantic version of the Howlin' Wolf song [...] "Killing Floor". In 1989, Clapton described the performance: [...] "He played just about every style you could think of, and not in a flashy way. I mean he did a few of his tricks, like playing with his teeth and behind his back, but it wasn't in an upstaging sense at all, and that was it... He walked off, and my life was never the same again".|$|E

500|$|Forty-five drivers {{attempted}} to qualify; due to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Keselowski clinched his first pole {{position in the}} Sprint Cup Series, {{with a time of}} 28.515. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Bowyer. Stewart qualified third, Jamie McMurray took fourth, and Juan Pablo Montoya started fifth. Johnson, one of the drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, qualified twenty-fifth, while Harvick was scored in twenty-seventh. The two drivers who failed to qualify for the race were Jeff Green and Johnny Sauter. Once qualifying concluded Keselowski said, [...] "I felt I got a shot at the pole before I qualified but you never really know. When I ran the lap I knew I gave up {{a little bit of time}} right in the middle of both corners <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> plan going into it and stuck to it and it worked. I’m really proud of that lap." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{serving his}} {{suspension}} {{of the rest of}} the , Ron Artest returned to the Pacers at the beginning of the [...] After playing 16 games he demanded to be traded, and the Pacers put him on the injured list. The Pacers' Walsh said that Artest's demands were [...] "the last straw", and many Pacers players who had fought in the brawl to help their teammate felt betrayed. Jackson later said, [...] "I put my career on the line for him, going into the stands and fighting ... I lost $3 million [...] there was no 'thank you' or nothing." [...] After more than a month of inactivity, Indiana traded Artest to the Sacramento Kings for Peja Stojaković. Artest faced Ben Wallace for the first time after the fight in November 2006, and finally made his return to Detroit in January 2007. During the Kings' 91–74 loss to the Pistons, Artest was booed constantly, but there were no unusual incidents. After a year's stop with the Houston Rockets in the 2008–09 season, Artest signed with the Los Angeles Lakers. After winning his first NBA championship in , Artest apologized to Jackson and other Pacers for being [...] "so young and egotistical", stating [...] "sometimes I feel like a coward when I see those guys. I'm on the Lakers, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chance to win with you guys. I feel almost like a coward." [...] On September 16, 2011, Artest legally changed his name to Metta World Peace.|$|E
500|$|The album's Roman numeral title {{referred}} {{to each of}} the band members having turned 20 years old by the time xx was released. Because of their age, many critics interpreted the songs as nocturnal depictions of adolescent lust. Philip Sherburne wrote in Spin that xx brimmed with a [...] "young lust" [...] often found in rock music, and recordings such as [...] "Fantasy" [...] and [...] "Shelter" [...] expressed a jaded yearning, particularly in a lyric from the latter song: [...] "Can I make it better with the lights turned on". Croft vehemently denied this: [...] "We were writing these songs when we were 17. I can honestly say I've never thought this is about my sex life." [...] Croft and Sim, who were both gay, did not intend for the songs to be heard as romantic duets; she said they were singing [...] "past each other" [...] rather than to each other. Having combined their individually written lyrics, they could not definitely explain what their songs were about, although Croft said Sim's lyrics resonated with her nonetheless and enjoyed the personal interpretation it offered. [...] "You can put them into your own life", she explained, [...] "like, 'Oh, this is my song. The romantic situations Sim wrote of had been inspired by other people. [...] "I hadn't really had any relationships to be working off, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> huge interest in life, and looking at other people's relationships around me", he said.|$|E

In {{her debut}} season, she {{combined}} with Wiltze (20-16, 1.88 ERA) for 31 of the 45 victories of the helpless Millerettes. The team received {{some pretty good}} performances from Helen Callaghan, who hit [...]287 (2nd in the league) and Faye Dancer (.274, 44 extrabases), who became the first girl to hit two home runs in a single game and two grand slams in a regular season. Playing their home games at Nicollet Park, the Millerettes could not compete with the local Minneapolis Millers. In addition, Minneapolis {{was far from the}} other five cities in the league, forcing the team to spend most of the season on the road. As a result, the team was replaced by the Fort Wayne Daisies in the 1945 season.|$|E

Coincidentally, Cosloy had just read a review of Girly Sound in Chemical Imbalance that very day and told Phair to send him a tape. Phair sent him a tape of six Girly Sound songs. Cosloy recalls: [...] "The songs were amazing. It was a fairly {{primitive}} recording, especially compared to the resulting album. The songs were really smart, really funny, and really harrowing, sometimes all at the same time[...] [...] [...] I liked it a lot and played it for everybody else.

2500|$|Blackwell {{first became}} {{interested}} in music through the influence of her fourth grade teacher, Nancy Notargiacomo, who eventually became her voice and piano teacher when she was 10. She also credits her high school choral director for encouraging her to pursue a music career. In a 2003 interview Blackwell recalled, [...] "I {{did not come from}} a musical family. I had a fourth grade teacher that introduced me to music and I sang at the Catholic church. In high school I started doing musicals − The Sound of Music, Brigadoon, Oliver!, and so forth. I thought maybe this would be what I would pursue after high school, although even in my {{senior year in high school}} I had doubts. I wanted to go into history or fashion design. <b>But,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> wonderful choral director who said 'no, your calling is music,' and she convinced me." ...|$|E
2500|$|MacCorkindale's film debut came in 1974 with Juggernaut. He {{was cast}} as Simon Doyle in the 1978 film {{adaptation}} of Agatha Christie's Death on the Nile {{at the age}} of 25. He became a friend of co-star Bette Davis, reflecting, [...] "There was a feeling of being in awe of these people <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> certain amount of pioneer courage, so I didn't let it get to me. But there were days when I thought, 'I'm about to do a scene with this cinema legend, am I up to it?' But people were very gracious. I was never the whipping boy because I was less experienced." [...] The role boosted MacCorkindale public profile and he considered it to be his career break. He won the London Evening Standard Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer for this part. MacCorkindale went on to star as sailor and spy Arthur Davies in The Riddle of the Sands (1979), the film adaptation of the celebrated Erskine Childers' novel.|$|E
2500|$|CNBC {{correspondent}} Jane Wells {{reported that}} the Occupy Wall Street movement sparked parodies which connect the movement to pop culture icons from Star Wars and Lord of the Rings and others. An image of Luke Skywalker holding a protest sign was published: [...] "It wasn't glamorous <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> steady living working on my uncle's moisture farm... my aunt and uncle were unjustly murdered and the farm destroyed. I {{was forced to leave}} my home and join an extinct cult just to survive. I am now a member of an upstart movement to take down a greedy corrupt establishment. I AM THE 99%." [...] Skywalker's enemies, the Imperial Storm Troopers, joined the protest on another image circulating on the Internet holding signs: [...] "End Galactic Corporate Greed", [...] "Get Our Troops Off Tatooine" [...] and [...] "Keep Your Empirical Hands Off My Healthcare". Parodies relating to Middle Earth include a woman who had written her complaint in Elvish, allegedly translated: [...] "I spend every waking hour fighting Orcs while Elrond and Galadriel eat lembas bread all day.
