2500|$|Many older North American sockets {{have two}} {{different}} current and voltage ratings, most commonly 10A 250V/15A 125V. This {{has to do}} with a peculiarity of the National Electrical Code from 1923 to the 1950s. Originally, sockets were rated at 10A 250V, because the NEC limited <b>lighting</b> <b>circuits</b> to 10A. In 1923, the code changed to allow <b>lighting</b> <b>circuits</b> to be fused at 15A, but the previous 10A rule still applied to circuits over 125V.
