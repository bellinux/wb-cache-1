[...] Cambridge edged back into {{contention}} by the Chiswick Steps and heading under Barnes Bridge were a length clear. [...] They passed the finishing post first, {{in a time of}} 17 minutes 49 seconds, a length-and-a-quarter ahead of Oxford. [...] It was Cambridge's first victory since 2004 and took their overall lead in the contest to 7973. [...] At the finish, following tradition, the Cambridge crew threw their cox, Dowbiggin, into the water in celebration. [...] She later said [...] "They flung me a really long way in there, and the water was freezing, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|Reportedly, two {{separate}} albums of new music were recorded by Shields {{in his home}} studio, but were abandoned. According to sources, one was possibly influenced by jungle music. Shields later confirmed {{that at least one}} full album of new material was abandoned. He said, [...] "We did an album's worth of half-finished stuff, and it did just get dumped, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> dumping. It was dead. It hadn't got that spirit, that life in it." [...] He later explained, [...] "I just stopped making records myself, and I suppose that must just seem weird to people. 'Why'd you do that?' The answer is, it wasn't as good [...] And I always promised myself I'd never do that, put out a worse record." [...] Shields later said to Magnet magazine, [...] "We are 100 per cent going to make another My Bloody Valentine record unless we die or something", and attributed the band's sparse output to a lack of inspiration. A third My Bloody Valentine album, MBV, was finally released in 2013, 22 years after Loveless.|$|E
500|$|According to Entertainment Weekly, MDNA World Tour {{shed light}} on the impact Madonna has had on the younger {{generation}} of artists, dancers, and general fans [...] "who refuse to conform for conformity's sake". Tull took the best moments from the 88different concerts of the tour, to create a cohesive documentary. He recalled that there were numerous footage available from the tour and they had to find the [...] "perfect" [...] shot for Madonna. He gave an example that the performance of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] had cuts from 50 countries alone. [...] "It was really intense. I think I looked down one day and I was like, 'Oh, my fingers are about to fall off'. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> it", Tull concluded. A preview for the DVD was first shown at the Billboard Music Awards and another preview was released in June 2013, showing the singer performing [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'" [...] on the tour, the lead single from MDNA. Another video showed Madonna auditioning for the dancers, while singing an acoustic version of her 2001 single, [...] "Don't Tell Me".|$|E

[...] said Zorn, [...] "I have to be there with them, and that's why I started playing saxophone, so that I could meet musicians. I still feel that I have to earn a player's trust before they can play my music. At the end of the day, I want players to say: this was fun—it was a lot of fucking work, and it's {{one of the hardest things}} I've ever done, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> the effort." ...|$|E
2500|$|Details {{regarding}} Akhmetov's past, how {{he obtained}} his wealth {{after the fall}} of communism in Ukraine, and the decade between 1985 and 1995 remain controversial. Akhmetov is said to have ties to organized crime. [...] Akhmetov has stated in interviews that he obtained his wealth by making risky business investments in the first years {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union, and responded to allegations in 2010, denying he has ever inherited any money from Akhat Bragin or anyone else: [...] "I have earned my first million by trading coal and coke, and spent the money on assets that no one wanted to buy. It was a risk <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> it". Many publications in Ukraine and other European countries have made claims about Akhmetov's alleged [...] "criminal past", some of which later retracted their statements.|$|E
