25|$|Maggie Barnes: Barnes {{claimed to}} be 117 at her death on 19 January 1998. Barnes, who was born to a slave and married a tenant farmer, had fifteen children; 11 of whom preceded her in death. Inconsistent records {{suggested}} that she was born on 6 March 1882 at the latest, but possibly a year earlier. The conclusion is that Barnes was at least 115 years and 319 days old at her death, and may have <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> two years older.|$|E
2500|$|Ai Ogawa (October 21, 1947 – March 20, 2010), born as Florence Anthony, was an American {{poet and}} educator. She won the 1999 National Book Award for Poetry for Vice: New and Selected Poems. Ai {{is known for}} her mastery of the {{dramatic}} monologue as a poetic form, {{as well as for}} taking on dark, controversial topics in her work. [...] About writing in the dramatic monologue form, she’s said: “I want to take the narrative ‘persona’ poem as far as I can, and I've never <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> do things in halves. All the way or nothing. I won't abandon that desire.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Red Sox {{pitching}} coach John Farrell stated that Buchholz {{would most likely}} be in line for 180–190 innings in the 2008 season. On May 15, Buchholz {{was placed on the}} 15-day disabled list {{as the result of a}} torn fingernail. He was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket following the injury, and remained there for several weeks to work on his fastball. On July 11, he was recalled to Boston and was part of their regular pitching rotation, though he did not record a single win after his return. On August 20, as the Red Sox were trying to sweep the Orioles, the team that Buchholz had no-hit the preceding year, he gave up a 4–0 lead by allowing three runs in the second inning and two more in the third. He was removed after only pitching [...] innings. In his previous start, he had only lasted three innings. In 2008, the Red Sox were 3–12 in Buchholz' fifteen starts. After the game, Buchholz was demoted to Double-A Portland. Buchholz stated [...] "I've never had a streak like this", and [...] "I've never <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> say the pressure was too much for me, but I've felt like I've had a lot of weight on my shoulders just trying to be perfect and trying to do everything as well as I could to help this team win". Following the 2008 season, Buchholz pitched in the Arizona Fall League.|$|E

60|$|Across {{the square}} of turf a tall man was {{advancing}} towards them, leaning on a strange long staff like a sceptre. He was clad in a fine but old-fashioned suit with knee-breeches; its colour was that shade between blue, violet and grey which {{can be seen in}} certain shadows of the woodland. His hair was whitish grey, and at the first glance, taken along with his knee-breeches, looked as if it was powdered. His advance was very quiet; but for the silver frost upon his head, he might have <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> the shadows of the wood.|$|E

Always he had been full of questions concerning all that passed around him; but there never had <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> answer his questions. In childhood he had wanted to KNOW, and, denied almost all knowledge, he still, in manhood, was filled with the great, unsatisfied curiosity of a child.|$|E
