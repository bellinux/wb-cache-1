40|$|In-mold {{assembly}} {{can be used}} {{to create}} plastic products with <b>articulated</b> <b>joints.</b> This process eliminates the need for post-molding assembly and reduces the number of parts being used in the product, hence improving the product quality. However, designing both products and molds is significantly more challenging in case of in-mold assembly. Currently, a systematic methodology does not exist for developing product and processes to exploit potential benefits of in-mold assembly for creating <b>articulated</b> <b>joints.</b> This paper is a step towards creating such a methodology and reports the following three results. First, it presents a model for designing assemblies and molding process so that the joint clearances and variation in the joint clearances can meet the performance goals. Second, it describes proven mold design templates for realizing revolute, prismatic, and spherical joints. Third, it describes a mold design methodology for designing molds for products that contain <b>articulated</b> <b>joints</b> and will be produced using in-mold assembly process.

50|$|A rod end bearing, {{also known}} as a heim joint (N. America) or rose joint (U.K. and elsewhere), is a {{mechanical}} <b>articulating</b> <b>joint.</b> Such joints are used on the ends of control rods, steering links, tie rods, or anywhere a precision <b>articulating</b> <b>joint</b> is required, and where a clevis end (which requires perfect 90 degree alignment between the attached shaft and the second component) is unsuitable. A ball swivel with an opening through which a bolt or other attaching hardware may pass is pressed into a circular casing with a threaded shaft attached. The threaded portion may be either male or female. The heim joint's advantage is that the ball insert permits the rod or bolt passing through it to be misaligned to a limited degree (an angle other than 90 degrees). A link terminated in two heim joints permits misalignment of their attached shafts (viz., other than 180 degrees) when used in tension. When used in compression, the through-rods are forced to the extreme ends of their ball's misalignment range, which cocks the link at an oblique angle.|$|R

40|$|AbstractDynamic {{simulation}} of mechanical behavior and {{response of the}} total human body to external forces provide essential input for the injury prediction criteria and subsequent design and development of crash protection systems. The most sophisticated versions of the total-human-body models are articulated and multisegmented to simulate all the major <b>articulating</b> <b>joints</b> and segments of the human body. Effectiveness of the multisegmented models to predict accurately live human response depends heavily on the proper biomechanical description and {{simulation of}} the <b>articulating</b> <b>joints.</b> This paper is concerned with a mathematical modelling of an <b>articulating</b> <b>joint</b> defined by contact surfaces of two body segments which execute a relative dynamic motion within the constraints of ligament forces. Mathematical equations for the joint model are {{in the form of}} second-order nonlinear differential equations coupled with nonlinear algebraic constraint conditions. Differential equations of motion are reduced to a set of nonlinear simultaneous algebraic equations by applying the Newmark method of differential approximation. By subsequent application of Newton—Raphson iteration process the same equations are converted to a set of simultaneous linear algebraic equations. Iteration process is continued until a solution vector of unknowns satisfying a prescribed convergence criterion is obtained. The two-dimensional version of the mathematical joint model is applied to human knee joint for several dynamic loading conditions on tibia. Results for the ligament and contact forces, contact point locations between femur and tibia and the corresponding dynamic orientation of tibia with respect to femur are obtained...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} report {{describes the}} execution of the master’s thesis that constitutes the completion of the masters degree in Mechanical Engineering with specialization in mechanical construction at Luleå University of Technology, Luleå. The work has been carried out by Johan Marklund in close cooperation with JAMA Mining Machines, Skelleftehamn. The main part of the development work has taken place on the premises of JAMA, with only a number of meetings with the external supervisor at Luleå University of Technology. The main goal of this work is to create a new design for the <b>articulated</b> <b>joint</b> in the chassis on which a number of JAMA’s machines is based on. This new construction will withstand higher loads with lower service needs which together gives the machines greater availability. Service and installation should be simplified with the new construction, primarily with respect to the space around and design of components. By using a structured work method called creative product development by Ulrich & Eppinger ensures a high quality throughout the entire process. As a step in this method, a detailed needs analysis was performed in which several, for JAMA, hidden problems and needs were identified. Several different concepts of alternative solutions were created during the work which four were selected for deeper analysis. On those a static stress analysis was conducted and then compared to a reference model based on the existing <b>articulated</b> <b>joint.</b> The final concept was chosen by qualitative selection methods inspired by Ulrich & Eppinger which consists of a number of weighting and selection matrices. These concepts were scored in consultation with the supervisor of JAMA. The winning concept was further developed and constructed on both system- and detail level. The result is a new <b>articulated</b> <b>joint,</b> which significantly reduces the problem areas that the old design had. The critical stress concentrations previously severely limiting the <b>articulated</b> <b>joints</b> life span has now almost decreased by half. New dedicated routes for example hydraulic hose are available in the new design which now allows more opportunities for hose routing even on a low-built machine. These and several other enhancements gives the machines a lower service needs with greater availability and an increased potential for development.

40|$|Motion {{control is}} one of the {{important}} components of animation. The process of creating motion of an animated character usually involves articulated model as shown in Figure 5. 1. Character animation can be described as the movement of multiple <b>articulated</b> <b>joints</b> hierarchically. All the <b>articulated</b> <b>joints</b> are connected by segments in a hierarchical form. Then, it is combined with a 3 D geometric model such as polygonal mesh. The trajectories or orientations of the joints are specified in the skeleton. The change of a root joint propagates to other sub-joints. For example, a rotation of hip joint made the entire leg to rotate (Jing 2005). There are four main techniques for creating 3 D character animation: keyframing, kinematics, dynamics and motion capture. In keyframing animation, the key values for the animated DOFs are specified by animator while the computer interpolates between these values. Motion capture is the process that is used to record the movements of the objects and to map the movements to a virtual character. These three techniques will be discussed in this chapter...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an articulating endoscopic screw driver {{that can be used to}} place screws in osteosynthetic plates during thoracoscopic surgery. The device is small enough to be used with a 12 mm trocar sleeve and transmits sufficient torque to fully secure bone screws. The <b>articulating</b> <b>joint</b> enables correct screw alignment at obtuse angles, up to 60 ° from the tool axis. A novel <b>articulating</b> <b>joint</b> is presented, wherein a flexible shaft both transmits torque and actuates the joint; antagonist force is provided by a super-elastic spring. Screws are Joseph E Petrzelka MED- 10 - 1046 2 secured against the driver blade during insertion with a retention mechanism that passively releases the screw once it is securely seated in the bone. The prototype has been fitted with a blade compatible with 2. 0 and 2. 3 mm self-drilling screws, though a different driver blade or drill bit can be easily attached. Efficacy of the tool has been demonstrated by thoracoscopically securing an osteosynthetic plate to a rib during an animal trial.

40|$|Pre-assembled {{turnouts}} {{have recently}} been introduced with split concrete sleepers joined by elastic coupling plates. Their effect on the forces, vibration response, and sound radiation as trains run through a turnout is studied here using a calculation model for a whole turnout based on the finite-element method. The non-linear characteristics of the ballast's support under the sleepers, {{as well as the}} special construction of the <b>articulated</b> <b>joints,</b> are included. It is shown that compared with the normal integral sleeper design, the track with articulated switch sleepers has a lower rigidity, which changes more evenly along the track and improves its dynamic performance. Furthermore, the fatigue strength of an articulated switch sleeper is higher due to its lower stress amplitudes. Additionally, when the vehicles are running on the main turnout route, as the switch sleepers’ vibration behaviour is modified, the <b>articulated</b> <b>joints</b> effectively reduce the impact loading of the ballast {{at the end of the}} sleeper under the turnout branch track. This will extend the life of the ballast bed. Finally, the sound radiation from the articulated switch sleeper is very low in the hinged short part and is reduced by about 0. 6 dB for the total length. <br/...|$|R
