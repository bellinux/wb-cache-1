One alternative considered is to have a raised seating area which connects the upper deck area with the Sky <b>Box</b> <b>section,</b> maintaining the view from the bridge. There are other proposed additions which include increasing the number of concession stands and restrooms, as well as installing a Jumbotron outside the east end of the stadium to provide for the viewing of the game from outside the stadium.|$|E

The design may {{have been influenced by}} the Jeep and the prototype, later nicknamed Centre Steer, was built on a Jeep chassis and axles. The early choice of colour was dictated by military surplus supplies of aircraft cockpit paint, so early vehicles only came in various shades of light green; all models until recently feature sturdy <b>box</b> <b>section</b> ladder-frame chassis. Early vehicles like the Series I were field-tested at Long Bennington and designed to be field-serviced.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} an experimental investigation of a novel FRP-concrete composite floor system. The system consists of a moulded glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) grating adhesively bonded to square pultruded GFRP <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> as structural formwork for a concrete slab. Holes cut into the top flange of the <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> at a variable spacing allow concrete ‘studs’ to form at the grating/box section interface. During casting, GFRP dowels are inserted into the holes to further connect the grating and <b>box</b> <b>sections.</b> Following component tests on the concrete-filled grating and shear connectors, six (300 x 150) mm and 3000 mm long slab specimens were designed and tested under five-point bending. From the resulting load-deflection curves, {{it was determined that}} all specimens behaved elastically and fully compositely until the initial peak was reached. No slip was observed between the concrete and GFRP <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> until the longitudinal shear failure occurred at the initial peak. The load capacity carried on increasing at a reduced stiffness in a progressive manner, with significant residual strength and slip observed. All specimens failed by the separation of the webs and flange at the upper corners of the <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> due to the large curvature induced. Full-scale experimental results demonstrated that the controlled longitudinal shear failure provided deformability to the overall system and a robust interaction between the concrete and FRP formwork was achieved...|$|R

The 1.2-metre thick base slab was cast first, {{followed by the}} 50cm thick central walls. [...] The outer walls and roof were cast together in a single operation, in six nominal 20-metre lengths, using special travelling formwork. [...] This was struck inside the formed section, moved along to the next length and then jacked up into position, each within a 72-hour cycle. [...] Each 1000 cubic metre pour required approximately 1500 square metres of formwork. The inside shutters for the outer walls were vertical steel section panels and Alform Beam walers, which were attached to the top slab of the special steel traveller, while the outer shutters were crane handled vertical steel section panels with Alform Beam or steel channel walers.|$|E

[...] They were gently tapering in plan with rounded tips. There was 5° dihedral outboard, but none on the centre section. Mass balanced ailerons, narrower than those of the Streak filled {{more than half of the}} trailing edge. [...] The mass balances were conspicuously mounted on extended upward arms from near the aileron root. The tailplane and split elevators were also of spruce and plywood, but fabric covered. [...] The rounded fin and rudder, though fabric covered had a steel tube structure. [...] The elevators and rudder were mass balanced, with external weights like those on the ailerons. [...] The rudder extended to the bottom of the fuselage, operating in a cut-out between the elevators.|$|E
2500|$|The P.10 was [...] a single-engined two-seat biplane with an {{airframe}} of {{high tensile}} steel, zinc treated and varnished against corrosion.

[...] Rather like the earlier P.6, the interwing gap was large and equal to the chord, putting the upper wing high above the fuselage. Either side of the centre section were a pair of vee struts to front and rear spars, assisted by another strut from front spar to the engine bulkhead [...] The wings were built around two I section spars, each a <b>box</b> <b>section</b> constructed from rolled strips. [...] The forward spar had four of these strips, the rear two. [...] The P.10 was displayed at the Paris Salon d'Aeronautique in 1919 without its fabric covering, the wing construction was in plain view. There were interconnected ailerons on both wings. [...] The P.10 had a small fin, which with its horn balanced rudder formed a teardrop shape. [...] The tail, with unbalanced elevators was strut braced to the fin.|$|E

2500|$|The {{experiments}} of William Fairbairn, and {{the mathematical}} analysis of Eaton Hodgkinson had shown {{by a series}} of experiments that an enclosed box girder, made of riveted wrought iron, combined relative lightness with great strength. The tubular wrought-iron girder – be the cross-section rectangular, triangular or circular – formed a most efficient truss component. If the cross-section was large enough it could be self-supporting. It was Fairbairn's experiments that led to the design of the Menai and Conwy bridges. Stephenson had originally proposed using a box-girder section suspended from chains. The <b>box</b> <b>section</b> would, he argued, be stiff enough to overcome the conventional problems of the bridge-decks of suspension bridges. In the event, Fairbairn showed that a properly constructed box girder would be strong enough so that the chains could be dispensed with. Nevertheless, the decision (not to use chains) was taken late in the project, so the Britannia bridge support towers were still built with holes for the chains. Stephenson's box-girders were a great innovation, and using steel or pre-stressed concrete instead of wrought iron, box-girder construction is the standard today for large bridges. But as Berridge has observed, [...] "Brunel was never one to follow fashion for fashion's sake... (at Chepstow)... Here was the real engineer at work, designing the bridge to suit the site and the best way of getting it into position".|$|E

The system consists of a moulded glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) grating adhesively bonded to rectangular pultruded GFRP <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> as structural formwork for a concrete slab. Holes cut into the top flange of the <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> at a variable spacing allow concrete 'studs' to form at the grating/box interface. During casting, GFRP dowels are inserted into the holes to further connect the grating and <b>box</b> <b>sections.</b> Following preliminary component tests on two concrete blocks, experimental {{results show that the}} concrete filled grating provides a 100 % increase in strain capacity when compared to a plain concrete block. It is therefore feasible to provide ductility to the complete system through the concrete in compression. Four push-out GFRP grating-box section specimens were then tested in double shear to assess the shear behaviour of the proposed GFRP dowel shear connector in both partially concrete-filled and fully concrete-filled <b>box</b> <b>sections.</b> From the resulting load-slip curves, a progressive longitudinal shear failure was seen to be provided by such a connection.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} concentrically loaded welded box and com-posite columns fabricated from 690 MPa high strength steel (HSS) and 100 MPa high strength concrete (HSC). Firstly, this thesis investigates the induced residual stress distributions in square welded sections fabricated from HSS plates with sin-gle and multiple weld passes. The non-destructive neutron diﬀraction technique was used to investigate the residual stresses in six test specimens: four specimens fabricated from 5 mm HSS plates using single weld passes, {{and the other two}} spec-imens fabricated from 16 mm HSS plates using six weld passes. Secondly, this thesis investigates the ultimate strength of short and slender welded box (HS) and short and slender composite sections (CB) fabricated from HSS and ﬁlled with HSC. Herein, forty ﬁve short test specimens having width to thickness ratios ranging from 15 to 40 and length to width ratios ranging from 3. 5 to 5 were tested. Furthermore, ﬁfteen slender test specimens (HS) and thirty nine slender test specimens (CB) having width to thickness ratios ranging from 15 to 40 and slenderness ratios ranging from 18 to 124 were tested to failure. Furthermore, ﬁnite element modelling (FEM) of the all test specimens was veri-ﬁed with the experimental results. The FEM was used to investigate the eﬀects of residual stresses induced from lightly and heavily welded <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> (HS) on the section and member capacity of welded <b>box</b> <b>sections.</b> The column curves of various design speciﬁcations pertaining to slender welded <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> were reviewed by the experimental and FEM peak strengths for the purpose of selecting the most appropriate curves for slender <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> having non-compact cross-sections.
