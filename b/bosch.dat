50|$|<b>Bosch's</b> namesake, the Dutch painter, {{was famous}} for his {{religious}} portrayal of earthly sins (mostly debauchery) and their violent consequences. In several of the books there are parallels suggested between the hell in the paintings and {{the events of the}} fictional <b>Bosch's</b> life.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bosch's</b> {{works are}} {{generally}} organized into three periods {{of his life}} dealing with the early works (c. 1470-1485), the middle period (c.1485-1500), and the late period (c. 1500 until his death). According to Stefan Fischer, thirteen of <b>Bosch's</b> surviving paintings were completed in the late period, with seven surviving paintings attributed to his middle period. <b>Bosch's</b> early period is studied {{in terms of his}} workshop activity and possibly some of his drawings. There are no surviving painting attributed to before 1485.|$|R
5|$|Yu's voice acting {{has been}} handled by Daisuke Namikawa in Japanese and Johnny Yong <b>Bosch</b> in English. <b>Bosch</b> felt uneasy about voicing Yu {{due to the}} fact he also voiced another {{character}} from the game, Tohru Adachi. However, when he initially learned that the protagonist would have very few lines, his worry evaporated. It was first planned that Yu's voice actor for the anime would be recast, because he and Adachi would begin to interact several more times. However, in the end <b>Bosch</b> remained as the voice of Yu to avoid disappointing the game players. In order {{to solve the problem of}} having both of his characters sound too similar, he decided to speak in a lower register for Yu.|$|E
5|$|He {{became a}} friend and {{correspondent}} of Eduard Douwes Dekker, who under the pseudonym Multatuli published Max Havelaar, the 1860 satire that exposed colonial corruption in Java; Dekker {{was one of the}} first subscribers to Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch-Indië. Another acquaintance was W. <b>Bosch,</b> chief of the public health services in the colony, who had written critically on the effects of the colonial system on the health of the population, arguing to his superiors that they should help combat poverty, malnourishment, and communicable diseases. <b>Bosch</b> had provided logistical assistance during the events of May 1848, and they remained friends even after van Hoëvell returned to the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Ichigo is {{voiced by}} Masakazu Morita in the Japanese anime, while {{as a child}} he is voiced by Yuki Matsuoka. Morita said that Ichigo {{was one of his}} {{favorite}} characters he ever played alongside Tidus from Final Fantasy X. Johnny Yong <b>Bosch</b> voices him in the English dub as a teenager, and Mona Marshall as a kid. While describing Ichigo as one of his best roles, Morita notes that voicing him can be at times difficult. <b>Bosch</b> has enjoyed voicing Ichigo's character due to his personal interest in the character's morals. However, he experienced difficulty voicing him in some scenes where Ichigo shouts for a long time.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, <b>Bosch's</b> work enjoyed a popular resurrection. The early surrealists' fascination with dreamscapes, the {{autonomy}} of the imagination, and a free-flowing connection to the unconscious brought about a renewed interest in his work. <b>Bosch's</b> imagery struck a chord with Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí in particular. Both knew his paintings firsthand, having seen The Garden of Earthly Delights in the Museo del Prado, and both regarded him as an art-historical mentor. Miró's The Tilled Field contains several parallels to <b>Bosch's</b> Garden: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work. Dalí's 1929 The Great Masturbator is similar to an image {{on the right side of}} the left panel of <b>Bosch's</b> Garden, composed of rocks, bushes and little animals resembling a face with a prominent nose and long eyelashes.|$|R

5|$|In 1947, Wilhelm Fränger {{argued that}} the triptych's center panel portrays a joyous world when mankind will {{experience}} a rebirth of the innocence enjoyed by Adam and Eve before their fall. In his book The Millennium of Hieronymus <b>Bosch,</b> Fränger wrote that <b>Bosch</b> {{was a member of}} the heretical sect known as the Adamiteswho were also known as the Homines intelligentia and Brethren and Sisters of the Free Spirit. This radical group, active in the area of the Rhine and the Netherlands, strove for a form of spirituality immune from sin even in the flesh and imbued the concept of lust with a paradisical innocence.|$|E
5|$|Just {{like the}} player's pilot, {{most of the}} other {{characters}} are low-key. The non-player character Admiral Aken <b>Bosch,</b> however, plays a crucial part in moving the story. As a prominent antagonist from the start, he sparks off a rebellion which escalates the scale of action, and brings in the other antagonist force, the Shivans, into the story. The storytelling took on a character-driven approach with expositions taking the form of cutscenes in which <b>Bosch</b> gives out monologues, revealing the purpose and driving forces behind his actions. A few established voice actors were brought in to give a polished touch to the voices in the game. Academy Award nominee Robert Loggia voiced the player's commanding officer, Admiral Petrarch, and Admiral <b>Bosch</b> was voiced by Ronny Cox. Kurtwood Smith and Stephen Baldwin participated in bit roles as well.|$|E
5|$|Many {{elements}} in the panel incorporate earlier iconographical conventions depicting hell. However, <b>Bosch</b> is innovative in that he describes hell not as a fantastical space, but as a realistic world containing many elements from day-to-day human life.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bosch's</b> subsidiary, Dreilinden Maschinenbau GmbH (DLMG) was an arms {{manufacturer}} in Kleinmachnow. This subsidiary employed forced laborers, {{prisoners of war}} and concentration camp detainees. There are two books published by Angela Martin and Hanna Sjöberg that report about <b>Bosch's</b> use of slave labor. Since 2006, there is a commemoration in the former forced labor camp.|$|R

5|$|The Brazilian {{subsidiaries}} of Magneti Marelli, Delphi and <b>Bosch</b> {{have developed}} and announced the introduction in 2009 {{of a new}} flex engine generation that {{eliminates the need for}} the secondary gasoline tank by warming the ethanol fuel during starting, and allowing flex vehicles to do a normal cold start at temperatures as low as, the lowest temperature expected anywhere in the Brazilian territory. Another improvement is the reduction of fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions, between 10% to 15% as compared to flex motors sold in 2008. In March 2009 Volkswagen do Brasil launched the Polo E-Flex, the first flex fuel model without an auxiliary tank for cold start. The Flex Start system used by the Polo was developed by <b>Bosch.</b>|$|E
5|$|The oldest writers, Dominicus Lampsonius and Karel van Mander, {{attached}} {{themselves to}} his most evident side, to the subject; their conception of <b>Bosch,</b> inventor of fantastic pieces of devilry and of infernal scenes, which prevails today (1937) {{in the public}} at large, and prevailed with historians until {{the last quarter of}} the 19th century.|$|E
40|$|Hieronymus <b>Bosch’s</b> (1450 - 1516) {{paintings}} have long fascinated, intrigued, and mystified viewers. In particular, the Garden of Earthly Delights (c. 1500) has generated much discussion and speculation. <b>Bosch’s</b> use of medieval symbols and fantastic images, his preoccupation with sinfulness and Hell, and his dismal view of mankind’s future {{have long been}} sources of study and speculation. Not only do art historians ponder his work, but so do social historians, philosophers, creative artists and the general viewing public. There is no definitive interpretation of <b>Bosch’s</b> Garden that explains the power the painting holds over its viewers. By examining various interpretations of <b>Bosch’s</b> works, coupled with a decipherment of the Garden using the Lacan’s theory of the Gaze and semiotics, the author argues {{that it is not}} possible for there to be a single, authoritative interpretation of the work. This dissertation shows that semiotics opens new avenues of investigation and interpretation; one where signs have multiple meanings and anxiety in the viewer can ensue. Consisting of two distinct yet interconnected parts: one written, one visual/creative. This dissertation allows for interaction with the painting in two languages. The written part explores how the Gaze draws the viewer into the narrative and discusses how, through semiotics, the creation of meaning is developed on different semiotic levels. The visual/creative section examines the intersections of ekphrasis, semiotics, and clay sculpture through the lens of Hieronymus <b>Bosch’s</b> work. Specifically, this creative portion the lack of ekphrastic interpretations of <b>Bosch’s</b> work in clay sculpture...|$|R
