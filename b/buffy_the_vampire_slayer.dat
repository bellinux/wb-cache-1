5|$|Perry was {{inspired}} to write the episode due to his interest in conspiracy theory literature, which he finds interesting but does not believe in. The Coast to Coast AM radio show featured in the episode also served as an inspiration, and its host Art Bell agreed to appear as himself.

5|$|Darla {{appears in}} twenty Angel episodes, mainly as an evil antagonist. The {{character}} {{is known for}} dying {{the most in the}} <b>Buffy</b> <b>The</b> <b>Vampire</b> <b>Slayer</b> franchise. Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry. I thought it was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment.

5|$|Each {{season of}} <b>Buffy</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vampire</b> <b>Slayer</b> (often {{simplified}} as Buffy) presents an overall theme episodes tie into.

She has been recovering well. In the previous episode, she receives flowers from a male suitor, which Buffy finds at the end of that episode. The fifth season also introduces Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg), Buffy's 14-year-old sister.

5000|$|As {{a result}} of <b>Buffy</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vampire</b> <b>Slayers</b> success, Whedon was allowed the {{opportunity}} to make his 1999 spin-off series, Angel. David Greenwalt and Whedon collaborated on the pilot {{that was going to be}} developed for The WB Network. During the series' early expansion, efforts were made by the network to mitigate Whedon's original concept. [...] "Corrupt", a precociously optioned second episode, was entirely abandoned due to the gloominess written into the script. The tone was consequently softened, establishing in the opening episodes Angel Investigations as an idealistic, shoestring operation. It follows Angel, who works as a private detective in order to [...] "help the helpless".|$|R
5000|$|The WB Network {{announced}} on February 13, 2004 that Angel {{would not be}} brought back for a sixth season. Whedon said of the cancellation, [...] "I believe the reason Angel had trouble on The WB {{was that it was}} the only show on the network that wasn't trying to be Buffy. It was a show about grown-ups". An official continuation of the story came rather {{in the form of a}} comic book series. Following <b>Buffy</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vampire</b> <b>Slayers</b> successful eighth season, IDW Publishing approached Whedon about similarly producing a canonical sixth season for Angel. Angel: After the Fall released 17 issues written by Whedon and Brian Lynch.|$|R

Jeff Perry, Loretta Devine and Debra Monk reprised their roles as Thatcher Grey, Adele Webber and Louise O'Malley, respectively.

5|$|The role of John Hart in Torchwood {{was written}} with the casting of Marsters in mind after he {{contacted}} the shows' producers expressing {{his interest in}} appearing in the programme's parent show, Doctor Who. The character is used to illuminate some of Jack's own characteristics as a doppelgänger who provides both an exaggerated version of, and a parallel to, aspects of Jack's persona. Both Marsters and the general media also compared aspects of Hart's character to Marsters's role as Spike in <b>Buffy</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vampire</b> <b>Slayer</b> and Angel. Whilst a few reviewers criticised the character in relation to his impact of the show's tone, a larger number welcomed the character and the energy Marsters brought to the role.|$|E
5|$|Nicola Griffith is {{the only}} creator to have won the other work award more than once, having won twice for editing anthologies; she was also {{nominated}} for once for her writing.

500|$|Connor's name {{is often}} {{mentioned}} with <b>Buffy</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vampire</b> <b>Slayers</b> Dawn Summers younger sister to Buffy Summers similarly created {{to give a}} strong emotional connection to the titular character. Four years after the cancellation of Angel, IGN included Connor along with Dawn in their list of classic TV's cliché of ‘Adding a Kid’ as a last-ditch effort to save a dying show. In order to avoid swamping themselves with comments from irate fans of either side, they did not say if his addition was a good or bad choice. David Hofstede in his book What Were They Thinking? openly criticized Connor and Dawn’s addition, appointing them number No.98 in his list of [...] "100 Dumbest Events in Television History".|$|R
500|$|The episode also {{received}} positive reviews in the United States. The Chicago Sun-Times summarised it as [...] "gay and playful sci-fi fun" [...] and compared it with <b>Buffy</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vampire</b> <b>Slayers</b> [...] "good and efficient wit", and theorised that its rising quality made it [...] "not {{hard to imagine}} it could be must-watch TV by season four", the Orlando Sentinel stated it was [...] "a bracing mix of campy comedy, chilling twists and sexual surprises" [...] and commented that it [...] "enlivens Saturdays", and the Sci Fi Channel, who syndicate Doctor Who, called the script [...] "excellent", commented that [...] "Marsters and Barrowman's chemistry is just terrific", and lamented that the show only airs thirteen episodes per series, {{as opposed to the}} American standard of 24.|$|R

In the fifth season of the series, he returned to reprise the role as a guest star in episodes 1-2 and 14-18. Woodside returned as a series regular for the sixth season as the President of the United States.|$|R
5|$|Christy is {{the oldest}} of Carl and Helen Jenkins's two daughters. Both of her parents are mortal, and her powers were {{inherited}} from her maternal grandmother, making her a carrier of the genes determining magical ability. As a witch, Christy possesses the basic ability to cast spells, perform rituals, brew potions, scry for lost people or objects {{through the use of}} a crystal pendant, and communicate with the dead. She also possesses an advanced form of telepathy, enabling her to hear and project her thoughts, as well as channeling other magical creatures' powers. Carl and Helen Jenkins (David Starzyk and Barbara Niven) said Christy heard voices prior to her kidnapping, implying that this power was already active. As a firestarter, Christy had the power of pyrokinesis; this power could be augmented by Billie's projection powers to vanquish demons previously believed to be invincible. Christy was identified as the Key to the Ultimate Power due to her relationship with Billie. Demain of Television Without Pity compared Christy to <b>Buffy</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vampire</b> <b>Slayer</b> character Dawn Summers as they were both referenced as the Key.|$|E
5|$|Veteran Disney Channel writers Schooley and McCorkle were {{recruited}} by the network to develop an animated series that could attract both younger and older audiences, and conceived Kim Possible as a show about a talented action heroine and her less competent sidekick. Inspired by the scarcity of female-led animated series at the time, the episodes, {{some of which are}} based on the creators' own high school experiences, combine elements of action, adventure, drama, romance and comedy to appeal to both girls and boys, while parodying the James Bond franchise, spy and superhero films, and teen sitcoms. Distinct from other Disney Channel shows in its use of self-referential humor, Schooley and McCorkle developed fast-paced sitcom-style dialogue to cater to adult viewers. Set in fictional Middleton, USA, the show's setting and locations exhibit a retro-influenced aesthetic. With a strong emphasis on modern-day technology and the Internet, the series also explores themes such as feminism, girl power and relationships, and receives heavy comparisons to other female-driven action shows such as <b>Buffy</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vampire</b> <b>Slayer,</b> Alias and The Powerpuff Girls.|$|E

5000|$|Alex Petridis of The Guardian {{was mixed}} about the album, {{saying that the}} {{production}} captures the band's live shows and political message but was {{put off by the}} vocal delivery, concluding that [...] "money cannot change vocalist Kathleen Hanna's tendency to sound snotty rather than angry, which frequently leaves you feeling like you're being harangued by <b>Buffy</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vampire</b> <b>Slayers</b> right-on classmate." [...] Nick Sylvester of Pitchfork Media criticized the album for taking less risks with the band's attempt at commercializing its genre-hopping political tracks to the mainstream masses, concluding that it [...] "ends up being merely a squandered opportunity, which sadly sums up This Island as well." [...] Derek Miller of Stylus Magazine felt the album toned down the band's penchant for delivering upbeat socio-political tracks that comes across more slick but soulless in its social message, saying that, [...] "This Island is expertly produced at times, with a crisp, micro-edged flaunt that belies their gauche political discourse." ...|$|R
5000|$|On November 4, 2014, it was {{announced}} that Lifetime had cancelled Witches of East End after a decline in ratings during the second season. The first season averaged 1.67 million viewers, but dropped in its second season to 1.13 million. After its cancellation, fans launched an online petition campaign to save the show called [...] "Renew Witches of East End". The petition became popular on Twitter, where fans were told to use the hashtag #RenewWitchesofEastEnd and tweet it to Lifetime's Twitter account. Fans have also campaigned the online streaming service Netflix to pick up the show.

As of June 2017 and after 3 years since the finale, the petition has received more than 272,000 signatures.|$|R
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, others thought the music felt forced. Inevitably, almost all reviews, both {{positive}} and negative, compared <b>the</b> episode to <b>Buffy</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vampire</b> <b>Slayers</b> musical episode, [...] "Once More, with Feeling". This comparison was also made by Bill Lawrence, who credits Buffy for inspiring Scrubs propensity for [...] "big" [...] episodes (such as this one, the multi-camera [...] "My Life in Four Cameras", and the Wizard of Oz parody [...] "My Way Home"). The singing abilities of the cast (Chalke in particular) came under some fire, but most critics agreed that most were competent, and that anything beyond that simply did not matter. Reyes and Faison were the only members of the cast (besides the Broadway star D'Abruzzo) to receive praise for their singing abilities. In general, the final assessments were positive. The episode was called [...] "the show's best episode thus far this season", [...] "worth all the hype", and [...] "a {{heck of a lot}} of fun". The episode is also the most popular download of the entire series of Scrubs in the iTunes Store.|$|R
