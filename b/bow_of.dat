5|$|A 60-ft-long {{fin whale}} was found {{stuck on the}} <b>bow</b> <b>of</b> a {{container}} ship in New York harbor on 12 April 2014.|$|E
5|$|After the {{war there}} were several plans (Project 27) to {{reconstruct}} Petropavlovsk, as she was now known, using the <b>bow</b> <b>of</b> Frunze and moving her third turret to the forward position, {{but they were not}} accepted and were formally cancelled on 29 June 1948. She was renamed Volkhov, after the nearby river, on 28 November 1950 and served as a stationary training ship until stricken on 4 September 1953 and broken up afterwards.|$|E
5|$|At {{ground level}} {{and inside the}} lobby, bas-reliefs depict {{the origins of the}} Price company. During the 1920s John M. Lyle, an {{influential}} architect of the Beaux-arts school, was developing a uniquely Canadian fusion of French and English colonial styles, and his ideas were applied by designers Ross and Macdonald to the construction of the Price Building. Each floor is symmetrically divided in two by a hallway, and a projection {{at the end of the}} building references the <b>bow</b> <b>of</b> a ship.|$|E
40|$|A case of {{congenital}} angulation and <b>bowing</b> <b>of</b> {{the long}} bones is reported. The condition {{belongs to a}} group of bone pathologies which have as a common feature an abnormal <b>bowing</b> <b>of</b> the diaphysis. The cortex at the concave side shows a thickening while the convex side shows a cortical thinning, corresponding to a structural adaptation to external compressing forces at the site <b>of</b> the <b>bowing</b> <b>of</b> the bone. The angulation is a consequence <b>of</b> <b>bowing</b> <b>of</b> long bones over other foetal parts. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|The most {{prominent}} and extensively documented findings of Weismann-Netter-Stuhl syndrome are on plain radiographs of the bones. Findings include bilateral and symmetric anterior <b>bowing</b> <b>of</b> both tibiae and fibulae, lateral <b>bowing</b> <b>of</b> the tibiae, femoral <b>bowing,</b> and squaring <b>of</b> iliac and pelvis bones.|$|R
5|$|In a final {{flashback}} scene, Guevara is {{aboard the}} Granma in 1956, {{looking out over}} the ocean, as the Cuban Revolution is about to begin. He sees the Castro brothers alone at the <b>bow</b> <b>of</b> the ship; Fidel is talking and Raúl is taking notes. Guevara hands a peeled orange to one of his comrades and returns his gaze to the lone brothers before the scene fades to black.|$|E
5|$|Peirithous– A {{prisoner}} of the Underworld who possessed the <b>Bow</b> <b>of</b> Apollo {{and was in}} love with Persephone; he was imprisoned by Hades for trying to make off with her. He offered his bow to Kratos in exchange for freedom, but the uncaring Spartan ignored the offer, killed Peirithous, and took the bow anyway. The character was voiced by Simon Templeman in God of War III.|$|E
5|$|She resumed her {{original}} name on 31 May 1943. After the war {{there were several}} plans to reconstruct her, using the <b>bow</b> <b>of</b> the Frunze, {{but they were not}} accepted and were formally cancelled on 29 June 1948. She was renamed Volkhov, after the nearby river, on 28 November 1950 and served as a stationary training ship until stricken on 4 September 1953. The ship was subsequently broken up.|$|E
25|$|There {{were four}} goblin-soldiers of greater stature, swart, slant-eyed, with thick legs and large hands. They were armed with short broad-bladed swords, {{not with the}} curved scimitars usual with Orcs: and they had <b>bows</b> <b>of</b> yew, in length and shape like the <b>bows</b> <b>of</b> Men.|$|R

40|$|Congenital {{dislocation}} of {{the knee}} (CDK) is a rare disorder. We report {{the case of a}} 7 -year-old girl with bilateral knee stiffness, marked anterior <b>bowing</b> <b>of</b> both legs, and inability to walk without aid. Radiologic investigation revealed bilateral knee joint dislocation accompanied by severe anterior <b>bowing</b> <b>of</b> both tibia proximally and posterior <b>bowing</b> <b>of</b> both femur distally, demonstrating a complicated congenital knee dislocation. Two-staged open reduction with proximal tibial osteotomy was performed to align the reduced knee joints. The patient was completely independent in her daily activities after surgical correction...|$|R
5|$|A {{fathometer}} was {{not required}} under USCG regulations, and Fitzgerald lacked one, even though fathometers were {{available at the time}} of her sinking. Instead, a hand line was the only method Fitzgerald had to take depth soundings. The hand line consisted of a piece of line knotted at measured intervals with a lead weight on the end. The line was thrown over the <b>bow</b> <b>of</b> the ship and the count of the knots measured the water depth. The NTSB investigation concluded that a fathometer would have provided Fitzgerald additional navigational data and made her less dependent on Anderson for navigational assistance.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{sources tell}} several {{different}} stories about Orion; {{there are two}} major versions of his birth and several versions of his death. The most important recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in Boeotia, his visit to Chios where he met Merope and after he violated her, was blinded by her father, Oenopion, the recovery of his sight at Lemnos, his hunting with Artemis on Crete, his death by the <b>bow</b> <b>of</b> Artemis or the sting of the giant scorpion which became Scorpio, and his elevation to the heavens. Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. These various incidents may originally have been independent, unrelated stories and it is impossible to tell whether omissions are simple brevity or represent a real disagreement.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Königsberg was ordered to attack British commerce around {{the entrance to the}} Red Sea. A lack of coal hampered Looff's efforts; the British prevented his collier Koenig from leaving Dar es Salaam and purchased all the coal in Portuguese East Africa to deny it to Königsberg. Looff then radioed the German steamer Zieten to warn her against using the Suez Canal, where she would have been confiscated. Königsberg chased after the German freighter Goldenfels, whose officers mistook the ship for a British cruiser and refused to stop. Königsberg was forced to fire a warning shot across the <b>bow</b> <b>of</b> Goldenfels to force the ship to stop so that Looff could warn her captain of the state of war.|$|E
40|$|The {{association}} of skeletal anomalies and aggressive fibromatosis has been documented. Isolated <b>bowing</b> <b>of</b> the ulna is rare, yet its occurrence, particularly {{in conjunction with}} congenital dislocation of the radial head, has been documented. This article presents two cases <b>of</b> ulnar <b>bowing</b> in which the patients subsequently developed aggressive fibromatosis. We feel that aggressive fibromatosis may be a latent manifestation <b>of</b> congenital <b>bowing</b> <b>of</b> the ulna. The course of the disease appears to be of an aggressive nature, and patients who present with <b>bowing</b> <b>of</b> the ulna should be followed for the potential development of this disease...|$|R
50|$|<b>Bows</b> <b>of</b> apology {{tend to be}} {{deeper and}} last longer than other types <b>of</b> <b>bow.</b> They occur with {{frequency}} during the apology, generally at about 45-50 degrees with the head lowered and lasting {{for at least the}} count of three, sometimes longer. The depth, frequency and duration <b>of</b> the <b>bow</b> increases with the sincerity of the apology and the severity <b>of</b> the offense. <b>Bows</b> <b>of</b> thanks follow the same pattern.|$|R

5|$|Brody and {{his wife}} Ellen follow an {{ambulance}} to the docks, where they find Tom as he is put on a stretcher; the divers suspect something scared him underwater. Deputy Len Hendricks, Brody's replacement, tells them Mike went sailing with his friends, so Brody, along with Ellen and Hendricks, takes the police boat to rescue them. They find Tina hiding in the <b>bow</b> <b>of</b> her boat, and she informs them of the shark's presence. Hendricks and Ellen take Tina to shore, where the truth is revealed, while Brody goes on to find the kids.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 NOAA divers {{and volunteers}} {{returned}} to the Monitor {{with the goal of}} obtaining overall video of the site to create a permanent record of the current conditions on the wreck after the turret recovery. Jeff Johnston of the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary (MNMS) also wanted a definitive image of the vessel's pilothouse. During the dives, Monitors iron pilothouse was located near the <b>bow</b> <b>of</b> the vessel and documented for the first time by videographer Rick Allen, of Nautilus Productions, in its inverted position.|$|E
5|$|Sevastopol and Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya {{remained}} on the active list {{after the end of}} the war although little is known of their activities. Both were reclassified as 'school battleships' (uchebnyi lineinyi korabl) in 1954 and stricken in 1956 after which they were slowly scrapped. There were several plans (Project 27) to reconstruct Petropavlovsk using the <b>bow</b> <b>of</b> Frunze, but they were not accepted and were formally cancelled on 29 June 1948. She was renamed Volkhov in 1950 and served as a stationary training ship until stricken in 1953 and subsequently broken up. Frunze was finally scrapped beginning in 1949.|$|E

5|$|Ten {{minutes after}} the French opened fire Goliath, {{ignoring}} fire from the fort to starboard and from Guerrier to port, most of which was too high to trouble the ship, crossed {{the head of the}} French line. Captain Thomas Foley had noticed as he approached that there was an unexpected gap between Guerrier and the shallow water of the shoal. On his own initiative, Foley decided to exploit this tactical error and changed his angle of approach to sail through the gap. As the <b>bow</b> <b>of</b> Guerrier came within range, Goliath opened fire, inflicting severe damage with a double-shotted raking broadside as the British ship turned to port and passed down the unprepared port side of Guerrier. Foley's Royal Marines and a company of Austrian grenadiers joined the attack, firing their muskets. Foley had intended to anchor alongside the French ship and engage it closely, but his anchor took too long to descend and his ship passed Guerrier entirely. Goliath eventually stopped close to the <b>bow</b> <b>of</b> Conquérant, opening fire on the new opponent and using the unengaged starboard guns to exchange occasional shots with the frigate Sérieuse and bomb vessel Hercule, which were anchored inshore of the battle line.|$|E
5|$|British {{reinforcement}} entered Basque Roads at 15:20, just as {{the crew}} of Calcutta abandoned the ship, withdrawing across the shoal. Forming a line of battle, the British opened a heavy fire on the nearby, and still grounded, Ville de Varsouvie while Beagle, armed with heavy carronades, nosed close inshore and took up station across the <b>bow</b> <b>of</b> Aquilon and raked the French ship repeatedly. For two hours these immobile French ships were battered by the British line with little reply, until at 17:30 both raised Union flags as an indication that they had surrendered. Shortly afterwards {{the crew of the}} wrecked Tonnere abandoned their ship and set it on fire. The French ship was destroyed by a magazine explosion at 19:30, followed at 20:30 by Calcutta, which had been mistakenly set on fire by an over-enthusiastic British boarding party. The storeship was carrying a large quantity of munitions, reportedly worth over half a million pounds in value, and produced an enormous explosion. Most of the British ships had suffered only minor damage and casualties from fire from the gun batteries on Île-d'Aix, where Revenge had temporarily grounded during the night and suffered 18 casualties. The French losses were minor except on Ville de Varsouvie, which had taken about 100 casualties in the exchange.|$|E
5|$|By 21:15, Pinsum {{realised}} {{that his}} heavily laden ship could not outrun Amethyst and reduced his speed, turning sharply {{in front of}} the British ship in an attempt to rake her. Seymour was prepared for the manoeuvre and countered it by turning sharply away from Thétis so that the French broadside fell harmlessly into the sea and both frigates performed a complete circle before returning to their previous course. Seymour then swung back towards the French ship, bringing Amethyst alongside and pouring a heavy fire into Thétis, which replied in kind. For 25 minutes, the frigates continued firing on one another from close range as they sailed westwards. At 21:40, Pinsum again attempted to rake Amethyst, trying to cross the British ship's stern as she pulled ahead. Seymour countered by slowing his ship and the French rigging became tangled in the British, the firing continuing as the crews worked to free their ships from one another. Separating a few minutes later, the frigates continued their close-range duel. Amethyst again pulled ahead at 22:05, Seymour successfully crossing the <b>bow</b> <b>of</b> the French ship from port and raking her before swinging back along the starboard side to resume the close range exchange of broadsides.|$|E

5|$|Endeavour then {{continued}} {{south along the}} coast of Africa and across the Atlantic to South America, arriving in Rio de Janeiro on 13 November 1768. Fresh food and water were brought aboard and the ship departed for Cape Horn, which she reached during stormy weather on 13 January 1769. Attempts to round the Cape over the next two days were unsuccessful, and Endeavour was repeatedly driven back by wind, rain and contrary tides. Cook noted that the seas off the Cape were large enough to regularly submerge the <b>bow</b> <b>of</b> the ship as she rode down from the crests of waves. At last, on 16 January the wind eased and the ship was able to pass the Cape and anchor in the Bay of Good Success on the Pacific coast. The crew were sent to collect wood and water, while Banks and his team gathered hundreds of plant specimens from along the icy shore. On 17 January two of Banks' servants died from cold while attempting to return to the ship during a heavy snowstorm.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{protection}} scheme of the Yamato class still suffered from several major design flaws and shortcomings. The torpedo defense system performed substantially worse than designed; in particular, very poor jointing between the upper-belt and lower-belt armour created a rupture-prone seam {{just below the}} waterline, causing the class to be susceptible to torpedoes. Other structural weaknesses existed near the <b>bow</b> <b>of</b> the vessels, where the armour plating was generally thinner. These deficiencies proved crucial, particularly {{for the first two}} members of the class when they were each seriously damaged by submarine torpedoes in 1943 and then sunk by torpedo bombers in 1944–45. The hull of the Shinano was subject to even greater structural weaknesses, being hastily constructed {{near the end of the}} war and having been equipped with incomplete armour and unsealed watertight compartments at the time of her sinking.|$|E
5|$|In {{the remains}} of a small cabin in the <b>bow</b> <b>of</b> the ship and in a few other {{locations}} around the wreck was found the earliest dated set of navigation instruments in Europe found so far: compasses, divider calipers, a stick used for charting, protractors, sounding leads, tide calculators and a logreel, an instrument for calculating speed. Several of these objects are not only unique in having such an early, definite dating, but also because they pre-date written records of their use; protractors would have reasonably been used to measure bearings and courses on maps, but sea charts are not known to have been used by English navigators {{during the first half of}} the 16th century, compasses were not depicted on English ships until the 1560s, and the first mention of a logreel is from 1574.|$|E

40|$|An 8 -year-old {{girl was}} {{referred}} to our department because <b>of</b> generalized <b>bowing</b> <b>of</b> long bones (radii, ulnae, and femora) and significant bilateral and symmetrical posteromedial <b>bowing</b> <b>of</b> the tibiae and fibulae. The femora were laterally bowed whereas the tibiae and fibulae showed posteromedial bowing between the middle and distal thirds of the tibia with posterior cortical thickening effectively causing the development of bilateral congenital anterolateral <b>bowing</b> <b>of</b> the tibiae and fibulae. We referred to closing-wedge osteotomy of the left tibia along with fibular osteotomy in order to realign the deformity. Due to the delayed appearance of skin stigmata in her early life, the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis was ruled out. At the age of 9 years, café-au-lait spots and axillary freckling were apparent. Genetic tests confirmed von Recklinghausen disease (neurofibromatosis type-I (NF 1)) (gene has been localised to 17 q 22). Interestingly, bilateral and symmetrical anteromedial <b>bowing</b> <b>of</b> the tibiae and fibulae has not been described in patients with NF-I...|$|R
