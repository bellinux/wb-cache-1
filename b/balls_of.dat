5|$|A few species release fertilized {{eggs into}} the water, but most retain the eggs until they hatch. There are {{four types of}} larvae, but all are <b>balls</b> <b>of</b> cells with an outer layer of cells whose flagellae or cilia enable the larvae to move. After {{swimming}} {{for a few days}} the larvae sink and crawl until they find a place to settle. Most of the cells transform into archeocytes and then into the types appropriate for their locations in a miniature adult sponge.|$|E

5|$|A nucleus {{typically}} contains between 1 and 10 compact structures called Cajal bodies or coiled bodies (CB), whose diameter measures between 0.2µm and 2.0µm {{depending on}} the cell type and species. When seen under an electron microscope, they resemble <b>balls</b> <b>of</b> tangled thread and are dense foci of distribution for the protein coilin. CBs {{are involved in a}} number of different roles relating to RNA processing, specifically small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) maturation, and histone mRNA modification.|$|E
5|$|Dung beetles form spherical <b>balls</b> <b>of</b> animal excrement, {{which they}} roll with their bodies, {{generally}} by walking backwards and pushing {{the ball with}} their rear legs. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times. The behavior of these beetles was noted in ancient Egyptian culture, which imparted sacred significance to their activities. Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face {{many of the same}} mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.|$|E
5|$|Glenn McGrath {{dominates the}} bowling records, and holds {{all but three}} of the records.

Chaminda Vaas took four wickets in five balls against Bangladesh in 2003, including wickets with the first three <b>balls</b> <b>of</b> the match. There have also been hat tricks in Cricket World Cups by Chetan Sharma, Saqlain Mushtaq, Brett Lee, Kemar Roach, Steven Finn and JP Duminy.|$|E

5|$|The only bowler to {{have taken}} three career hat-tricks is Lasith Malinga of Sri Lanka, while three other bowlers (Wasim Akram, Saqlain Mushtaq and Chaminda Vaas) have taken two hat-tricks. Hat-tricks are {{dominated}} by fast bowlers with Pakistan's Saqlain Mushtaq, Bangladesh's Abdur Razzak and Taijul Islam, Zimbabwe's Prosper Utseya, South Africa's JP Duminy, Sri Lanka's Wanidu Hasaranga and India's Kuldeep Yadav, the only seven spinners {{to have taken}} an ODI hat-trick. Vaas of Sri Lanka became the only bowler to claim a hat-trick {{in the first three}} <b>balls</b> <b>of</b> any form of international cricket when he took the first three wickets off the opening three <b>balls</b> <b>of</b> their match against Bangladesh during the 2003 World Cup. Lasith Malinga is also the only player to claim 4 consecutive wickets in 4 balls, a feat he achieved against South Africa. Three players have taken a hat-trick on their ODI debut: Taijul Islam from Bangladesh in a match against Zimbabwe, Kagiso Rabada from South Africa against Bangladesh, and Wanidu Hasaranga from Sri Lanka against Zimbabwe. Eight hat-tricks have occurred in World Cup matches.|$|E

5|$|After its {{perihelion}} passage, {{the comet}} moved into dark skies, {{and although it}} faded as it receded from the Sun it remained {{one of the most}} prominent objects in the sky. On 30 September, observers, including Finlay and E. E. Barnard, began to notice that the comet's nucleus was elongated and broken into two pronounced bright <b>balls</b> <b>of</b> light, and by 17 October it was clear that it had broken into at least five fragments. Observers reported that the relative brightness of the fragments varied from day to day.|$|E
5|$|Although Chell is {{equipped}} with mechanized heel springs to prevent damage from falling, she can be killed by various other hazards in the test chambers, such as turret guns, bouncing <b>balls</b> <b>of</b> energy, and toxic liquid. She can also be killed by objects falling through portals, and {{by a series of}} crushers that appear in certain levels. Unlike most action games at the time, there is no health indicator; Chell dies if she is dealt a certain amount of damage in a short time period, but returns to full health fairly quickly. Some obstacles, such as the energy balls and crushing pistons, deal fatal damage with a single blow.|$|E

Carcaje is a popular sweet red tea extracted from hibiscus leaves. Alcoholic beverages, though absent in the north, are popular in the south, where people drink millet beer, known as billi-billi when brewed from red millet, and as coshate when from white millet.|$|E

A record eighth-wicket partnership between James Hildreth and Thomas of 50 brought the victory within reach, and Thomas' highest-score in Twenty20 cricket granted Somerset the win. Somerset lost their second match, being bowled out for their second-lowest Twenty20 total, 106 by Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E

The album's lyrics focus on the 9 circles of hell, and the morality of man as he is torn between righteousness and evil.

5|$|The oldest known blast {{furnaces}} in the West {{were built in}} Dürstel in Switzerland, the Märkische Sauerland in Germany, and at Lapphyttan in Sweden, where the complex was active between 1205 and 1300. At Noraskog in the Swedish parish of Järnboås, {{there have also been}} found traces of {{blast furnaces}} dated even earlier, possibly to around 1100. These early blast furnaces, like the Chinese examples, were very inefficient compared to those used today. The iron from the Lapphyttan complex was used to produce <b>balls</b> <b>of</b> wrought iron known as osmonds, and these were traded internationally – a possible reference occurs in a treaty with Novgorod from 1203 and several certain references in accounts of English customs from the 1250s and 1320s. Other furnaces of the 13th to 15th centuries have been identified in Westphalia.|$|E

The third pillar has an inscription by Raja Raja Chola I. Apart from these, there are five other pillars with inscriptions by the Pallava kings Dantivarman I, Nandivarman III and Kambavarman, the Rashtrakuta king Krishna III and the Chola king Rajendra Chola III.|$|E
5|$|A {{biography}} by Galileo's pupil Vincenzo Viviani {{stated that}} Galileo had dropped <b>balls</b> <b>of</b> the same material, but different masses, from the Leaning Tower of Pisa {{to demonstrate that}} their time of descent was independent of their mass. This was contrary to what Aristotle had taught: that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones, {{in direct proportion to}} weight. While this story has been retold in popular accounts, there is no account by Galileo himself of such an experiment, and it is generally accepted by historians that it was at most a thought experiment which did not actually take place. An exception is Drake, who argues that the experiment did take place, more or less as Viviani described it. The experiment described was actually performed by Simon Stevin (commonly known as Stevinus) and Jan Cornets de Groot, although the building used was actually the church tower in Delft in 1586. However, most of his experiments with falling bodies were carried out using inclined planes where both the issues of timing and air resistance were much reduced.|$|E
