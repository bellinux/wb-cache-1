40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the variability in spark assisted chemical engraving (SACE) gravity <b>feed</b> <b>drilling</b> in glass. SACE gravity <b>feed</b> <b>drilling</b> is a novel micromachining technology for use on non-conducting materials that has yet to move beyond academic investigation. However, SACE is a promising technology. It can be used to create high quality structures, at low cost, using a machine that could be installed into any laboratory. One problem SACE faces is it has issues with reproducibility. This is why the variability of the process is studied here. The goal of this thesis is to quantify and reduce the variability in SACE gravity <b>feed</b> <b>drilling.</b> This goal is accomplished through three steps. First, the process is modeled to provide an efficient way to quantify variability. Two new stochastic models are presented that relate the depth evolution of SACE gravity <b>feed</b> <b>drilling</b> to the voltage. Statistical tests are used to validate the models. Second, experimental studies of the variability of the depth evolution are discussed. The effect on the variability of having poorly regulated bulk electrolyte temperature and level is studied. Finally, experimental results from two feedback controllers that are capable of reducing the variability in SACE gravity <b>feed</b> <b>drilling</b> are discussed. The results from these controllers are compared with the predictions of one of the models developed...|$|R

50|$|The rechambering to the 8mm calibre and the {{adoption}} of a <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> succeeded in improving both the stopping power and the rate of fire of the machine-gun; however, it reportedly suffered from jammings rather often.|$|R
50|$|The Oerlikon KBA 25 mm cannon is a fully automatic, {{positively}} locked, gas-operated weapon with {{a rotating}} bolt head and double <b>belt</b> <b>feed.</b> These features guarantee high reliability and safety, {{even under the}} most extreme environmental conditions.|$|R
50|$|All {{openings}} on {{the machine}} gun, particularly the ejector port {{on the left and}} the <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> entrance on the right, are covered with spring-loaded dust covers so that the openings are only exposed when they need to be.|$|R
50|$|In {{the factory}} museum at Kongsberg Weapon Factory, there is {{preserved}} an interesting prototype of a M1894 modified for <b>belt</b> <b>feed.</b> Although no documentation has been uncovered, it's {{clear that the}} rifle has been modified {{at an early stage}} in the manufacturing process to use the same <b>feed</b> <b>belts</b> that were used on the Hotchkiss heavy machine gun in use in the Norwegian Army at the time.|$|R
5000|$|The M1919 {{originally}} {{fired the}} [...]30 cal M1906 (30-06) ball cartridge, {{and later the}} [...]30 caliber M2 ball cartridge, contained in a woven cloth <b>belt,</b> <b>feeding</b> from left to right. A metal M1 link was later adopted, forming a [...] "disintegrating" [...] belt.|$|R

50|$|The Oerlikon KBA is a gas {{operated}} selective fire weapon taking a 25 mm cartridge from a dual selective <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> and firing {{at a rate}} of 600 rounds per minute, it has been developed as a close-range multipurpose weapon for the modern battlefield.|$|R
50|$|In 1939, Degtyaryov {{designed}} {{his heavy}} machine gun called ДС, or DS (Дегтярёва Станковый). The DS-39 was issued to the Red Army and used in the Winter War of 1939-1940. The <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> mechanism damaged the cartridge cases and the gun was found too complicated and liable to malfunctions and was withdrawn from service.|$|R
50|$|The gun was fed from a drum {{magazine}} of only thirty rounds, {{and had a}} poor rate of fire. Shpagin developed a <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> mechanism to fit to the DK giving rise, in 1938, {{to the adoption of}} the gun as the DShK 1938. This became the standard Soviet heavy machine gun in World War II.|$|R
50|$|Before long, the Holek {{brothers}} {{abandoned the}} <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> {{in favor of}} a top-feeding box magazine and the resulting weapon, known as the Praha I-23, was selected. Despite the past legal troubles, manufacture of the new weapon had commenced at the ZB factory by late 1926, and it became the standard light machine gun of the Czechoslovak Army by 1928.|$|R
50|$|The Bailey Machine Gun used a <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> {{system that}} did not remove the {{cartridges}} from the belt as the weapon was fired. Other rapid-fire weapons of this era used a drum or hopper to hold the ammunition. The belt-feed {{was considered to be}} very innovative, and many later machine guns would end up using belt-feed mechanisms of some sort.|$|R
50|$|The <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> lever was {{connected}} to the <b>belt</b> <b>feeding</b> pawl at the front end, had a cam pin at the rear end which ran through a track {{in the top of the}} bolt, and a pin in the feed tray cover acted as the pivot between the two ends. The rearward movement of the bolt caused the rear end of the feed lever to pull to the right, causing the feeding pawl at the other end to move left over the belt. The pawl would pull the belt further to the right as the bolt came forward again, also sending the loose M1 link of the previous round to be taken out of the belt to fly out the right side of the receiver. A recoil buffer tube extended from the back of the receiver to make the cycle of the bolt smoother than previous designs, to absorb some of the recoil of the bolt, and formed a place for the pistol grip to be installed.|$|R
50|$|The GSh-6-23 {{uses the}} 23x115 Russian AM-23 round, fed via linked {{cartridge}} belt or a linkless feed system. The linkless system, adopted after {{problems with the}} <b>belt</b> <b>feed,</b> is limited to 8,500 rpm. Fire control is electrical, using a 27 V DC system. The cannon has 10 pyrotechnic cocking charges, {{similar to those used}} in European gas-operated revolver cannons such as the DEFA 554 or Mauser BK-27.|$|R
5000|$|The design drew on many common {{concepts}} in firearms manufacture of the period, such as stamped sheet metal construction, <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> (a modified mechanism for <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> from the MG42 {{with a single}} pawl), quick barrel replacement, a pistol grip and stock, and a Semi bullpup design similar to the FG 42 (much of the action occupies the weapon's stock). The M60's operating system of an operating rod turning a rotating bolt {{was inspired by the}} FG 42, which was based on the much earlier Lewis Gun. The M60 was even constructed with a secondary assisting firing pin spring that is used in the FG 42 in semi-automatic mode even though it is actually unnecessary in the M60 (which operates only in full automatic mode). The M60's gas operation is unique, and drew on technical advances of the period, particularly the White [...] "gas expansion and cutoff" [...] principle also exploited by the M14 rifle. The M60's gas system was simpler than other gas systems and easier to clean.|$|R
50|$|The limited {{ammunition}} capacity was {{an important}} disadvantage. The Type 99 Mark 1 Fixed Model 3 could be equipped with a 100 round drum, but {{the size of the}} drum was itself a problem in fighter installations, although the Model 3 guns were installed on the initial production versions of the A6M3. A more practical solution was provided by the Type 99 Mark 1 Fixed Model 4, which featured a Kawamura-developed <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{aircraft}} {{machine gun}} produced by S.A.F.A.T was the M1928, a scaled-up {{variant of the}} M1926 with a <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> and increased rate of fire. However, its main change was {{the adoption of the}} 8 mm Fiat cartridge instead the usual M1891 6.5 mm ammunition. Worth to mention that the [...] "8mm FIAT" [...] designation was in fact a fancy name for the 7.7x56R cartridge (.303 British). Both types were completely interchangeable.|$|R
50|$|The Caldwell {{machine gun}} was {{designed}} by Thomas F. Caldwell of Melbourne, {{who moved to the}} United Kingdom to bring his invention to the notice of British Army authorities. The weapon was in appearance similar to the Maxim gun, but came with two barrels, capable of working in conjunction or separately with a discharge of 500 rpm. It used pan magazines containing 104 rounds, instead of the <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> of the Maxim gun which was prone to jamming.|$|R
50|$|The {{front of}} the {{basement}} is a crawlspace. The rear is excavated and has the utilities for the house. It has a central vacuum system with connections in each room of {{the house for the}} vacuum hose. It has a coal-burning furnace that produces steam for heating. The furnace has a conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> system that brings coal from the basement utility room. The basement was altered in 1970 that included a bedroom and an acoustical tile ceiling.|$|R
30|$|In summary, {{the divided}} {{conveyer}} <b>belt</b> <b>feeding</b> system, {{which has been}} first presented by the author in 2003 [12], and its potential to reduce, respectively, eliminate the reduction of input performance caused by mutual impediment have been discussed in this article. In the course of developing the system, several validation procedures have been performed on a prototype with four input stations that produced evidence for the occurrence of mutual impediment and gave insight into the origins of this phenomenon [12, 16].|$|R
50|$|The URZ AP is a 7.62x51mm NATO calibre delayed {{blowback}} assault rifle. The weapon uses {{a rotating}} bolt delayed blowback operation with 2 lugs with rollers {{to overcome a}} quarter twist to accelerate the bolt carrier and unlock. To ease extraction, the barrel has a fluted chamber to prevent ruptured cartridges. The select fire capability fires from closed bolt in semi auto and open bolt in full auto. The <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> uses a feeding rotor found in the ammo box.|$|R
50|$|The gun was {{designed}} by Heinrich von Wimmersperg of Austria, who after World War II, moved to Detroit, USA. He also designed the Wimmersperg Maschinengewehr in 1937, a double-barreled, combined gas/recoil operated firearm fed from either magazines or a <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> with 7.92×57mm cartridges — which was unusual for that the top barrel acted as a gas piston. The over/under barrels fire and reload vice versa. In his later years, he patented designs for car seats for infants and toddlers.|$|R
5000|$|The 15.5x106 was FN's second {{effort to}} make a KPV {{competitor}} in the BRG-15, appropriately by necking out the KPV's case. It also utilized an unusual dual feed device (A la Hafdasa C-4), with link ammunition <b>belts</b> <b>feeding</b> from both the right and left. Spent shell casings were ejected out of {{the bottom of the}} gun, as in FN's later P90 personal defense weapon. The quick-change barrel assembly developed for the BRG-15 was redesigned for use in an updated version of the M2HB.|$|R
50|$|The RMG 7.62 is a {{development}} of the MG3, intended as a vehicle mounted weapon where changing the overheated barrel would be a problem. Like the MG3, it is a recoil operated weapon that fires at about 800rpm and uses the <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> from the MG3. The weapon comes with a cluster of 3 barrels that change over when overheated leaving the previously lined up barrel to cool off. This is not a rotary weapon like a Minigun, although {{it appears to be}} one externally.|$|R
50|$|Because the M2 was {{intentionally}} {{designed to}} operate in many configurations, it {{can be adapted to}} feed from the left or right side of the weapon by exchanging the belt-holding pawls, and the front and rear cartridge stops (three-piece set to include link stripper), then reversing the bolt switch. The operator must also convert the top-cover <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> slide assembly from left to right hand feed as well as the spring and plunger in the feed arm. This will take a well trained individual less than two minutes to perform.|$|R
50|$|Hawker's {{innovative}} ideas at {{this time}} greatly benefited the still fledgling RFC. He helped to invent the Prideaux disintegrating link machine-gun <b>belt</b> <b>feed,</b> and initiated the practice of putting fabric protective coverings on the tips of wooden propellers, the use of fur-lined thigh boots, and devising a primitive 'rocking fuselage' for target practice on the ground. In 1916 he also developed (with W.L. French) the increased capacity 97-round 'double drum' for the Lewis machine gun. It was issued for trials in July and after modifications was issued generally to the RFC and RNAS.|$|R
50|$|These factors {{severely}} {{affected the}} weapon's reliability. After {{several months of}} testing, the Stoner 63 system was ultimately deemed to be unacceptable for service use. The Army submitted recommendations for improvements to the design - these included a stainless steel gas cylinder, a two-position fire selector with separate safety, ejection port dust covers and modifications to the <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> mechanism. The upgrades resulted in the improved Stoner 63A, which began production in 1966. Only about 2,000 examples of the initial version were manufactured before {{the transition to the}} model 63A.|$|R
50|$|This mollusc is a {{predator}} and <b>feeds</b> by <b>drilling</b> sedentary or semi-mobile prey. It eats only other molluscs, mainly gastropods {{of the genera}} Cerithium, Rissoina, Heliacus, and Bittium, and the mussel Hormomya.|$|R
30|$|Even {{though the}} {{initially}} chosen approach for removing the phenomenon with a divided conveyer <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> (patent DE 100 51 932 A) seemed promising (cf. [12]), {{it turned out}} {{that as long as the}} input was spatially restricted a slight reduction of the overall performance still occurred. As a result of this insight, the variability of the input moved to the centre of attention. The probabilistic model described in the next section serves, in addition to practical experiment, as a tool to investigate the interplay between the divided conveyer belt as such and the variability of input.|$|R
50|$|Developments in {{machine gun}} {{technology}} {{culminated in the}} Maschinengewehr 42 (MG42) which was of an advanced design unmatched at the time. It spurred post-war development {{on both sides of}} the upcoming Cold War and is still used by some armies to this day including the German Bundeswehr's MG 3. The Heckler & Koch G3, and many other Heckler & Koch designs, came from its system of operation. The United States military meshed the operating system of the FG 42 with the <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> system of the MG42 to create the M60 machine gun used in the Vietnam War.|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{the grit}} sizes {{of the sand}} <b>belt,</b> <b>feeding</b> speed and the feed power of {{the heads of the}} sander on the surface {{roughness}} of the particleboard panels were investigated. Two surface roughness parameters, average roughness (Ra) and mean peak-to-valley height (Rz), obtained from board surfaces were used in the analysis. Sanding factors were found to have a signifi-cant effect on the surface roughness of the particleboard. Better results were obtained with 40 m/min of feeding speed, 40 - 60 - 80 - 120 of grit sizes, and 67 kW of the feed power of the heads of the sander...|$|R
40|$|Oligochaetes (Annelida) {{are active}} bioturbators {{that can be}} present in high densities in the {{transition}} zone between intertidal flats and salt marshes, though their occurrence and functional role remain understudied. This study aimed to clarify the biogeomorphic role of oligochaete bioturbation in facilitating or hindering vegetation establishment. Two microcosm experiments were performed to assess the effect of oligochaete bioturbation on sediment properties, oxidation depth, algal biomass, seed distribution, and germination success of pioneer species Salicornia spp. Oligochaetes created burrow networks in the sediment matrix, which, together with upward conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>feeding,</b> lead to substrate mixing. Sediment reworking rates of oligochaetes were {{compared with those of}} polychaete macrofauna. Bioturbation and bio-irrigation of burrows can stimulate resource flows into the sediment. Oxidation depth increased almost tenfold in the presence of oligochaetes. Their bioturbation did not seem to affect sediment properties such as dry bulk density, porosity, and organic matter content. Sediment reworking, however, significantly reduced algal biomass at the surface with possible cascading effects on sediment stability and erodibility. Oligochaete conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>feeding</b> buried Salicornia spp. seeds until below the critical germination depth, thus negatively affecting Salicornia spp. germination and seedling establishment. Our study indicates that small, though numerous, oligochaete bioturbators may reduce lateral expansion potential of salt marshes by hindering the establishment of pioneer vegetation in the transition zone. Additionally, in dynamic fine-grained habitats, these oligochaetes have the feature to quickly oxygenate the sediment top layer...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s the HK21’s design was {{simplified}} and the feed mechanism was modified. The machine gun's weight was increased, a carrying handle and a hooked buttstock with improved buffer mechanism were also added. Since then, the HK21 was offered in two main variants: the HK21A1 general-purpose machine gun (with a different <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> mechanism) and the HK11A1 automatic rifle (optimized for magazine feed only). The HK11A1 proved {{more successful in}} export sales and {{was adopted by the}} Hellenic Army and several African and Asian armies. Both weapons, as in the original HK21, can be converted to chamber the 5.56×45mm NATO round by replacing the appropriate components.|$|R
