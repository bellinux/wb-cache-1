40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a study of the}} cooling-off or waiting period clauses {{embedded}} in the majority of Bilateral Investment Treaties. Based on an analysis of applicable legislation,investment arbitration case law and doctrine, this paper evidences the existence of three conflicting trends with respect to the existence and nature of any obligations arising out of the cooling-off period clauses. Interpreting article 31 of the Vienna Convention of the Law of Treaties convention this paper concludes that cooling-off period clauses involve a <b>best</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>obligation</b> by the parties to engage in good faith negotiations. To determine the nature of the said obligation and based on negotiation theory, this paper draws on the substantive and formal issues involved in investor-State conflicts. Finally, and contrary to the prevailing trend, this paper concludes that arbitral tribunals should resort to negotiation theory-focused-approaches when determining parties’ compliance with cooling-off period obligations, analyzing each case in a separate and flexible manner...|$|E

40|$|The future {{high-speed}} networks {{will need}} to support diverse traffic and provide services to flows with Quality of Service (QoS) requirements {{as well as to}} <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> flows. In this paper we analyze the coexistence of the QoS and <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> flows from the routing and scheduling point of view. We concentrate in our routing and scheduling analysis on the network bandwidth resource. We present two sets of source routing algorithms: (1) the bandwidth-constrained routing with imprecise state information for QoS flows, and (2) the maxmin fair routing for <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> flows. The routing analysis includes an extensive description of various algorithms in their domains and their complexity discussion. Furthermore, we discuss two level hierarchical scheduling which is tailored towards the needs raised by the coexistence of QoS and <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> flows. We show that this scheduling design accomplishes two design goals (1) guaranteeing QoS for QoS flows and (2) ensuring fairness for <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> flows [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> traffic {{delivery}} in 802. 11 e contention-based networks. Differently from most previous paper which focus on the support of quality of service (QoS) requirements, we study the tuning of the access parameters for the <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> traffic. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we discuss the coexistence between legacy DCF and EDCA stations, since, for guaranteeing the backward compatibility, the <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> service class defined in EDCA should correspond to the legacy DCF. We show what configurations of the access parameters are closer to the DCF protocol, by taking into account the slightly different backoff rules defined in EDCA. Second, we explore the optimizations that can be performed by dynamically tuning the access parameters, on a per-beacon basis, in the case of homogeneous <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> sources. We propose an effective algorithm able to maximize the system throughput, by adapting the minimum contention window to the network contention level. Finally, we analyze the amount of resources available for <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> traffic in presence of QoS traffic. We show that the dynamic adaptation of the minimum contention window {{as a function of the}} channel wasted times can be a valid solution to automatically regulate the <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> offered load in the network...|$|R
40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} and analyze the factors utilized by superintendents in achieving their 2 ̆ 2 personal best 2 ̆ 2 in education. The data for this study were gathered from fifty-two superintendents from California, Iowa, Missouri, and New York during the months of December 1989 and January 1990. The superintendents each filled out and returned a 2 ̆ 2 Personal Best Survey 2 ̆ 2 from which the data for the study were gleaned;Major findings of this study include: (1) The most frequently used practices utilized by superintendents in achieving their personal <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> were delineated. The most frequently used practice reported by superintendents was to enable others to act. (2) The background and situational factors of the personal <b>best</b> <b>efforts</b> were identified and analyzed. The superintendents wrote regarding improving the climate most frequently in their personal <b>best</b> <b>effort.</b> (3) The superintendents 2 ̆ 7 actions, regarding the success of their personal <b>best</b> <b>effort,</b> were categorized into the appropriate strategy utilized. (4) The superintendents were excited and fearful as they initiated their personal <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> and they were self-satisfied during its implementation. (5) Superintendents learned to lead from others, experience, and educational training. (6) The size of the district had no significant impact on how superintendents identified and analyzed factors in achieving their personal <b>best</b> <b>effort...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this thesis, we {{consider}} resource allocation schemes for infrastructure-based multipoint-to-point wireless networks like IEEE 802. 16 networks and infrastructure-less ad-hoc networks. In the multipoint-to-point networks, we propose channel and Transport layer aware uplink scheduling schemes for both real-time and <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> services, whereas in ad-hoc networks, we propose channel aware congestion control schemes for <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> services. We also evaluate {{the performance of}} IEEE 802. 16 networks by conducting various experiments in the current deployed IEEE 802. 16 networks of a leading telecom operator in India. The results of our experiments motivate us to further investigate scheduling schemes specific to real-time and <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> services...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{explanation}} for the underpricing of <b>best</b> <b>efforts</b> new issues and demonstrates that <b>best</b> <b>efforts</b> contracts allow issuers to use information from the market. If investors obtain information that indicates that a project will not be profitable, their demand will be low and the offering will be withdrawn. If this information is costly, investors will have to be compensated for its purchase through a lower offering price, which means that issuers will have to underprice. The result is consistent with the empirical observation that underpricing is considerably greater for <b>best</b> <b>efforts</b> than for firm commitment contracts.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{availability}} of sophisticated network quality of service (QoS) guaranteeing mechanisms, it is apparent {{that a large number of}} applications will continue using the <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> service class. The main reason for this is that the QoS guaranteeing mechanisms are complex and many applications are not capable of using these complex services. At the same time, the standard <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> service is rather unpredictable and hence insufficient for many applications. Thus augmenting <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> services to an appropriate standard without incurring a high level of complexity is necessary. In this paper, two such augmentations are described in the context of the UBR service of ATM networks. Selective packet discarding is used to achieve the necessary goals...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} interactions among flow-level performance metrics when integrating QoS and <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> flows in a wireless system using opportunistic scheduling. We in-troduce a simple flow-level model capturing the salient features of bandwidth sharing for an opportunistic scheduler which ensures a mean throughput to each QoS stream for every time slot. We then explore the flow-level performance showing that integration of QoS and <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> flows results in loss in opportunism, {{which in turn}} results in a reduction of the stability region, degradation in system throughput, and increased file transfer delay. These losses are shown to be proportional to opportunistic gains, the guaranteed bandwidth and number of QoS flows, but inversely proportional to SNR under a Rayleigh fading channel model. In an integrated system exploiting opportunism, local instability {{appears to be more}} severe than in wired networks and average delays experienced by <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> flows are prolonged. We suggest that a form of admission control for <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> flows is necessary to avoid local instability, and ensure adequate performance. I...|$|R
