The horrified king summons Daniel, who upbraids {{him for his}} lack of humility before God and interprets the message: Belshazzar's kingdom {{will be given to}} the Medes and Persians. <b>Belshazzar</b> rewards Daniel and raises him to be third in the kingdom, and that very night <b>Belshazzar</b> is slain and Darius the Mede takes the kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Darius the Mede is {{mentioned}} in the Book of Daniel as king of Babylon between <b>Belshazzar</b> and Cyrus the Great, {{but he is not}} known to history, and no additional king can be placed between the known figures of <b>Belshazzar</b> and Cyrus. Most scholars view him as a literary fiction, but some have tried to harmonise the Book of Daniel with history by identifying him with various known figures, notably Cyrus or Ugbaru, the general who was first to enter Babylon when it fell to the Persians in 539 BCE.|$|E

25|$|The {{short-lived}} 11th dynasty of the Kings of Babylon (6th century BC) is conventionally {{known to}} historians as the Chaldean Dynasty, although the last rulers, Nabonidus {{and his son}} <b>Belshazzar,</b> were from Assyria.|$|E
25|$|Labashi-Marduk reigned {{only for}} a matter of months, being deposed by Nabonidus in late 556 BC. Nabonidus was {{certainly}} not a Chaldean, but an Assyrian from Harran, the last capital of Assyria, and {{proved to be the}} final native Mesopotamian king of Babylon. He and his son, the regent <b>Belshazzar,</b> were deposed by the Persians under Cyrus II in 539 BC.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} Nebuchadnezzar II (c. 634–562 BC) took Jerusalem in 597 BC, but {{the madness}} {{plot of the}} opera differs from both archeological and biblical records of him. In the Book of Daniel, his madness lasts for seven years before his conversion to Judaism. But in the opera it only lasts for the time between the order to kill the Fenena and the Jews, and it being carried out. The biblical story of seven year madness followed by conversion bears more similarity to the Dead Sea Scrolls' story of Nabonidus (556–539 BC), father of <b>Belshazzar</b> in the Cylinders of Nabonidus, than to the historical Nebuchadnezzar. Nabonidus was five kings later than Nebuchadnezzar, the last king of Babylon, and <b>Belshazzar</b> was a temporary regent during Nabonidus' reign. Historical and biblical records agree that the Jews were freed and their temple was rebuilt not by the Babylonians but by Cyrus the Great following his conquest of Babylon in 539 BC. The opera's Nabucco character is thus a composite of historical and biblical Nebuchadnezzar II, Nabonidus and Cyrus.|$|E

25|$|After {{extending}} his empire from the Mediterranean to Central Asia, Cyrus {{turned his attention}} to Babylonia. The most important ancient sources for his conquest of Babylon are the Nabonidus Chronicle (Nabonidus was the last Babylonian king, and <b>Belshazzar,</b> who is described as king of Babylon in the Book of Daniel, was his son and crown prince), the Cyrus Cylinder, and the Verse Account of Naboniduswhich, despite its name, was commissioned by Cyrus.|$|E
25|$|After its fall, Assyria came to {{be ruled}} by the Median Empire as Athura for a short period. Ironically, Nabonidus, the last king of Babylon, was Assyrian, {{originating}} from Harran, as was his son <b>Belshazzar.</b> After this it was ruled by Achaemenid Persia (Assyria revolted against Persia in 520 BC), Seleucid Greece, then again by various Persian dynasties, Sassanids, Parthians, etc. For a brief period under Trajan, it was ruled by Rome.|$|E
25|$|The Neo-Assyrian empire {{collapsed}} due to {{a bitter}} series of civil wars followed by a combined attack by Medes, Persians, Scythians and their own Babylonian relations. The last Assyrian city to fall was Harran in southeast Anatolia. This city was {{the birthplace of the}} last king of Babylon, the Assyrian Nabonidus and his son and regent <b>Belshazzar.</b> Much of the region then fell to the short-lived Iran-based Median Empire, with the Babylonians and Scythians briefly appropriating some territory.|$|E

25|$|Classical-singing {{commentator}} Michael Scott (who, incidentally, calls Coates 'one of {{the finest}} English singers on record') notes in The Record of Singing that his repertoire was exceptionally wide-ranging and included Handel's Messiah and <b>Belshazzar,</b> Mendelssohn's St Paul and Elijah, Bach's St Matthew Passion, Elgar's King Olaf and Saint-Saëns's The Promised Land. John Coates and Gervase Elwes were great friends, and Coates stood in for an indisposed Elwes on (at least) one occasion at Gloucester. On another occasion, at Worcester in 1911, Elwes (a Roman Catholic) was booked to sing Gerontius, but upon being told that the name of Mary Mother of God must be excluded from the text (to sing, 'Jesu, pray for me' instead of 'Mary' etc., and with other absurd substitutions and cuts) on the insistence of the Dean and Chapter, he refused to perform, and Coates {{was called in to}} replace him. Coates performed the Bach Mass in B minor in the April Festival of 1915 at Queen's Hall, under Henri Verbrugghen.|$|E

Daniel interprets the words: <b>Belshazzar</b> has been weighed and found wanting, and his kingdom is to be divided between the Medes and Persians. The story concludes: [...] "That very night <b>Belshazzar</b> the Chaldean (Babylonian) king was killed, and Darius the Mede received the kingdom." ...|$|E

Ugbaru is presumably the same person as the Gorbyras mentioned by the Greek historian Xenophon, a Babylonian provincial governor who switched to the Persian side. Cyrus made his entrance into the city a few days later; Nabonidus was captured and his life spared, but nothing is known of the fate of <b>Belshazzar.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In {{the third}} year of <b>Belshazzar</b> Daniel has vision of a ram and goat. The ram has two mighty horns, one longer than the other, and it charges west, north and south, overpowering all other beasts. A goat with a single horn appears from the west and destroys the ram. The goat becomes very {{powerful}} until the horn breaks off and is replaced by four lesser horns. A small horn that grows very large, it stops the daily temple sacrifices and desecrates the sanctuary for two thousand three hundred [...] "evening and mornings" [...] (which could be either 1150 or 2300 days) until the temple is cleansed. The angel Gabriel informs him that the ram represents the Medes and Persians, the goat is Greece, and the [...] "little horn" [...] is a wicked king.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} year of <b>Belshazzar</b> Daniel has a dream of four monstrous beasts arising from the sea. The fourth, a beast with ten horns, devours the whole earth, {{treading}} it down and crushing it, and a further small horn appears and uproots three of the earlier horns. The Ancient of Days judges and destroys the beast, and [...] "one like a son of man" [...] is given everlasting kingship over the entire world. A divine being explains that the four beasts represent four kings, but that [...] "the holy ones of the Most High" [...] would receive the everlasting kingdom. The fourth beast would be a fourth kingdom with ten kings, and another king who would pull down three kings and make war on the [...] "holy ones" [...] for [...] "a time, two times and a half," [...] after which the heavenly judgement will be made against him and the [...] "holy ones" [...] will receive the everlasting kingdom.|$|E
