Based on shifting level processes II new Irafic model is introduced and its implications are addressed as well. ...|$|R

In the first example, a spherical particle rolling along a rough surface experiences an effective viscous friction on large <b>lime</b> <b>scales.</b> It is due to temporal correlations among collisions with incomplete normal restitution. The second example is a sheared granular packing. There, spatial correlations among non-sliding and sliding contacts with Coulomb friction suggest that the deviatoric stress, although responsible for the dissipation, is localized on bonds that are non-sliding and hence non-dissipativ...|$|R

25|$|The {{effect of}} the latter is {{especially}} evident in day-to-day life {{of people who have}} hard water. Water in aquifers underground can be exposed to levels of CO2 much higher than atmospheric. As such water percolates through calcium carbonate rock, the CaCO3 dissolves according to the second trend. When that same water then emerges from the tap, in time it comes into equilibrium with CO2 levels in the air by outgassing its excess CO2. The calcium carbonate becomes less soluble as a result and the excess precipitates as <b>lime</b> <b>scale.</b> This same process is responsible for the formation of stalactites and stalagmites in limestone caves.|$|R

40|$|R 1393 Magnetic water {{conditioning}} to prevent <b>lime</b> <b>scale</b> formation {{has a long}} and controversial history. The current interpretation of the working principle is that the magnetic field interferes with crystal nucleation and growth processes resulting in formation of less adherent forms of calcium carbonate. Here we report an observation that sheds {{new light on the}} working principle. We conducted hard water through an orthogonal magnetic field. The application of the magnetohydrodynamic force on the water caused pronounced fragmentation of the natural suspended particles. This formation of suspended nanoparticles provides solution borne nucleation centers for crystallization of calcium carbonate thus preventing limestone deposition on the macroscopic surfaces.

50|$|Various {{household}} {{cleaning products}} {{have been developed}} to facilitate the removal of dust and dirt, for surface maintenance, and for disinfection. Products are available in powder, liquid or spray form. The basic ingredients determine the type of cleaning tasks for which they are suitable. Some are packaged as general purpose cleaning materials while others are targeted at specific cleaning tasks such as drain clearing, oven cleaning, <b>lime</b> <b>scale</b> removal and polishing furniture. Household cleaning products provide aesthetic and hygiene benefits but are also associated with health risks for the users, and building occupants. The US Department of Health and Human Services offers the public access to the Household Products Database. This database provides consumer information for over 4,000 products based on information provided by the manufacturer through the material safety data sheet.|$|R
5000|$|Ultrasonic {{cleaning}} uses cavitation bubbles {{induced by}} high frequency pressure (sound) waves to agitate a liquid. The agitation produces high forces on contaminants adhering to substrates like metals, plastics, glass, rubber, and ceramics. This action also penetrates blind holes, cracks, and recesses. The {{intention is to}} thoroughly remove all traces of contamination tightly adhering or embedded onto solid surfaces. Water or solvents can be used, {{depending on the type}} of contamination and the workpiece. Contaminants can include dust, dirt, oil, pigments, rust, grease, algae, fungus, bacteria, <b>lime</b> <b>scale,</b> polishing compounds, flux agents, fingerprints, soot wax and mold release agents, biological soil like blood, and so on. Ultrasonic cleaning can be used for a wide range of workpiece shapes, sizes and materials, and may not require the part to be disassembled prior to cleaning.|$|R
