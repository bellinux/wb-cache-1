5|$|Baldwin {{called a}} general {{election}} for 30 May 1929. Chamberlain expected the Conservatives to easily triumph, and {{thought he would be}} moved either to the Exchequer or <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to serve at the Colonial Office, where Joseph Chamberlain had made his mark. Chamberlain easily won in Edgbaston, which he represented {{for the rest of his}} life, but the general election resulted in a hung parliament, with Labour holding the most seats. Baldwin and his Government resigned, and Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald took office.|$|E

5|$|Brown's {{comments}} at Duke {{and subsequent}} reprimand by President Gerald Ford were {{reported on the}} front page of The Washington Post on 13 and 14 November 1974. There was speculation that Brown would <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to resign, or at least not be nominated for a second two-year term; but he was renominated and went on to serve under the new president, Jimmy Carter.|$|E
5|$|But how, it may <b>be</b> <b>asked,</b> can any {{analogous}} principle {{apply in}} nature? I believe it can and does apply most efficiently, from the simple circumstance {{that the more}} diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature, and so be enabled to increase in numbers.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{commercial}} and critical failure of Pinkerton (1996), Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo placed the band on hiatus. He returned to Harvard University to finish his studies, but eventually dropped out to focus on songwriting. During this time, Cuomo played with a different group of musicians in the band Homie, based in Boston. One {{of the members of}} Homie was Mikey Welsh, a bass player who would eventually <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to replace Matt Sharp in Weezer.|$|E

5|$|Further {{appointments}} followed. Stainer {{became an}} honorary {{fellow of the}} Royal Academy of Music in 1877 and an examiner for the Doctor of Music degree at Cambridge and London Universities. He accepted the post of Musical Director of the Madrigal Society of London. He was particularly honoured to <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to be a juror at the French Exhibition in Paris in 1878 and in 1880 was an adjudicator at the Welsh Eisteddfod at Caernarvon. He was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1879.|$|E
5|$|Questions {{were asked}} in the House of Commons {{about the cost of}} {{policing}} the statue, which required six constables a day at a cost of £700 a year. London's police commissioner wrote to Battersea Council to ask that they contribute to it. Councillor John Archer, later Mayor of Battersea and the first black mayor in London, told the Daily Mail that he was amazed by the request, considering Battersea was already paying £22,000 a year in police rates. The Canine Defence League wondered whether, if Battersea were to organize raids on laboratories, the laboratories would <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to pay the policing costs themselves.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Emily Spivey and {{directed}} by Nicole Holofcener. Parker Posey guest starred as Leslie's rival and former best friend, Lindsay Carlisle Shay. A longtime fan of Parks and Recreation and its star Amy Poehler, Posey had expressed an early interest in appearing on the show, and reportedly became frustrated with {{how long it took}} to <b>be</b> <b>asked.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{remaining}} three contestants <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> 12 questions. Previously (before season 5) {{the number of}} questions was 18.

5|$|The {{idea that}} McGarty play a child groomed for sex {{was put to}} the actress on 9 January 2008. Santer has stated that, had McGarty or her parents objected to the storyline, {{they would not have}} gone ahead with it.

5|$|The patient's own {{description}} {{is the best}} measure of pain; they will usually <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to estimate intensity {{on a scale of}} 0–10 (with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain they have ever felt). Some patients, however, may be unable to give verbal feedback about their pain. In these cases you must rely on physiological indicators such as facial expressions, body movements, and vocalizations such as moaning.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} work on Southampton's defences {{resulted in}} considerable improvements: {{by the late}} 14th century, the town was completely encircled by 2km (1.25 miles) of stone walls. Some existing buildings, including a dovecote, were reinforced and pressed into service {{as part of the}} defences. South Gate was built to protect the southern quays, with a wide archway, complete with parapets and machicolations. The building work proved very expensive, however, and despite the mayor and bailiffs enforcing contributions and assistance from the citizens, Parliament had to <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> several times in the 1370s to assist by remitting arrears of taxes owed by Southampton.|$|E
5000|$|This {{exercise}} {{asks the}} user to occupy several [...] "chairs" [...] {{during the course of}} the practice. Initially, they <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> to occupy the chair of the self-critic, and to express their feelings of self-criticism. They <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> to analyze this criticism and make note of its defining characteristics. Then, the user <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> to take the chair of their criticized self, and to imagine verbally responding to their inner critic. Subsequently, the user is prompted to conduct a dialogue between these two aspects of the self, the criticizer and the criticized. Following this, the user <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> to imagine themself as a compassionate observer of this dialogue, and finally the user <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> to reflect upon the experience.|$|R
5|$|Deployment without weapons: On {{a number}} of occasions, {{soldiers}} <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to deploy without weapons by UNTAG civilian officials.

5|$|Workers who {{experience}} acute {{low back pain}} {{as a result of}} a work injury may <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> by their employers to have x-rays. As in other cases, testing is not indicated unless red flags are present. An employer's concern about legal liability is not a medical indication and should not be used to justify medical testing when it is not indicated. There should be no legal reason for encouraging people to have tests which a health care provider determines are not indicated.|$|E
5|$|Written by Chris Avellone, the {{character}} was {{created as a}} sounding board for the game's theme {{of the role of}} the Jedi and the nature of the Force, and was heavily influenced by s Ravel Puzzlewell. She served both to test the player and to act as a mouthpiece for any questions Avellone thought should <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> about the Star Wars universe. Sara Kestelman voiced {{the character}}, with Kreia's casting being considered the most important of all the characters. Her name references Princess Leia of the original Star Wars trilogy, while her character design draws both on Palpatine's hood and Obi-Wan Kenobi's robes.|$|E

5|$|At this time, private loyalty-review {{boards and}} anti-communist {{investigators}} {{began to appear}} to fill a growing demand among certain industries to certify that their employees were above reproach. Companies that {{were concerned about the}} sensitivity of their business, or who, like the entertainment industry, felt particularly vulnerable to public opinion made use of these private services. For a fee, these teams would investigate employees and question them about their politics and affiliations. At such hearings, the subject would usually not have a right to the presence of an attorney, and as with HUAC, the interviewee might <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to defend himself against accusations without being allowed to cross-examine the accuser. These agencies would keep cross-referenced lists of leftist organizations, publications, rallies, charities and the like, as well as lists of individuals who were known or suspected communists. Books such as Red Channels and newsletters such as Counterattack and Confidential Information were published to keep track of communist and leftist organizations and individuals. Insofar as the various blacklists of McCarthyism were actual physical lists, they were created and maintained by these private organizations.|$|E
5|$|During the study, various {{accusations of}} foul play by or unsuitability of both {{submarine}} designers were made by Australian politicians and the media. These included claims that the similar left-wing political leanings of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Swedish Social Democratic Party, both in power at the time, {{would lead to a}} pro-Kockums bias, investigations into perceived coaching of IDL/HDW representatives in the questions to <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> at an ALP Caucus briefing session on the project, and public emphasis on security incidents in both Sweden and West Germany. These incidents either lacked supporting evidence or were proven false, and were the result of the Liberal Party attempting to discredit the Labor government, or pro-British politicians and organisations who believed both submarines were inferior to the Vickers Type 2400offering.|$|E
5|$|In the Hanzhong state, sin and {{criminal}} behavior were not differentiated. In order to eliminate sin, an adherent {{first had to}} acknowledge his crime, and then {{would have to go}} to a 'quiet room' to meditate. There, he would have to write three confessions which would be offered to the Lord of Heaven, the Lord of Earth and the Lord of Water. For public crimes, an accused would be pardoned three times for his actions and then be sentenced. A sentence depended on the type of crime, but always involved community service. For a minor crime, the sentence was usually to repair a road. A repeat offender might <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to donate building materials to improve local buildings. Other laws banned alcohol and prohibited the killing of animals during the spring and summer.|$|E
