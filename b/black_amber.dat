5000|$|According to Winifred Walker's All the Plants of the Bible, shecheleth {{is a form}} of rock rose, Cistus ladaniferus var. Cistus creticus, which {{produces}} a resin called labdanum. [...] This sweet spicy ingredient has been used in perfumes and incense for thousands of years and grows profusely in the Middle East, specifically in Israel and Palestine. The rock rose is a bush, not a tree (the Talmud states that onycha comes from a ground plant and not a tree) which bears flowers widely noted for the markings upon its petals resembling human fingernails. Labdanum is the gray-black resin that exudes from the branches of the rock rose bush. Labdanum, after it matures, becomes black and is referred to as <b>black</b> <b>amber</b> or black balsam. Gill states that the word [...] "shecheleth is certainly related to the Hebrew word shechor (black)," [...] denoting the color of the shecheleth used in the ketoret formula. Onycha is a play on the word onyx which was a gem. The onyx most esteemed by the ancients was the black gem. The Hebrew word for onyx was shoham and “Braun traces shoham to the Arabic sachma,'blackness:' 'Of such a color,' says he, 'are the Arabian onyxes, which have a black ground-color.' This agrees essentially with Charles William King's remarks [...] 'The Arabian species,' he says, 'were formed of black or blue strata.” [...] The rock rose also has an inseparable identification with rocks because its existence depends upon its roots anchoring among them in areas where no other foliage is able to grow. After labdanum became hard it may have been put through another process causing it to emulate even more of the [...] "beautiful" [...] attributes of the onyx or to refine it, [...] "that it be pleasant." [...] When used in sacred rites resins were often steeped in wine to, among other things, increase their fragrance.|$|E

40|$|Turkish <b>black</b> <b>amber</b> named Oltutaşi in Turkish {{is one of}} {{the best}} {{examples}} of semi-precious stone to be found in the world. It is mainly extracted in the county of Oltu (Erzurum) and surrounding mountains, NE Turkey since the 18 th century. At the present time, it is known as ornamental stone and its rosary is very famous worldwide. However, there is no modern review of geological properties of the Oltutaşi and Oltutaşi-bearing deposits. This paper filling this gap presents the results of original research on the subject. The Oltutaşi-bearing deposit with Jurassic-Cretaceous is a flych-character sequence, including limestone, sandstone interbedded with volcanic, sandstone, marl and claystone levels. The Oltutaşi is seen as a form of lenses with 0. 2 to 75 mm in thick within the Oltutaşi-bearing geological material represented by pebble-sandstone-siltstone alternation, including sandy-claystone and marl levels. These lenses present the folded and faulted structures in parallel with the main rocks due to the tectonic deformation affecting the region. It is seen from microphotographs that Oltutaşi dominantly consists of carbon and it includes resinite and maceral such as fusinite and semifusinite. Also, it is possible to observe that euhedral pyrite and hematite minerals generally finely disseminated the Oltutaşi organic matter...|$|E
40|$|Gagat je vrsta bituminoznog ugljena baršunastocrne ili smeđe boje, voštana ili masna sjaja. U stvari radi se o fosiliziranom drvu iz roda Araucariaceae iz geološkog razdoblja jure, od pred oko 180 milijuna godina. Zbog svog organskog porijekla ne spada u kamenje, ali se zbog svojih svojstava ubraja u plemenite materijale. Odlično se polira i upotrebljava kao uresni kamen. Nalazi se u rudnicima ugljena, u obliku oblutaka različitih dimenzija. Najpoznatija nalazišta gagata u svijetu su u Engleskoj, u Njemačkoj, u Francuskoj, Španjolskoj, Sjedinjenim Američkim Državama, Češkoj, Slovačkoj, Poljskoj, Portugalu. U antici korišten je za izradu nakita (ogrlica, privjesaka, narukvica, prstena, ukosnica i sl.). Radom na sređivanju građe u depoima Arheološkog muzeja Zadar odvojena je poveća skupina uglavnom neiventiranih i nesigniranih ulomaka, te nekoliko cjelovitih narukvica i drugih predmeta od gagata, u članku su kataloški obrađena 22 primjerka. Jet (German Gagat/Pechkohle, French jaïet, jais, Croatian gagat, Spanish azabache, Italian giaietto) {{is a type}} of {{bituminous}} coal of a velvet-black or brown colour, with a waxy or greasy shine. In fact, it is fossilised wood from the Araucariaceae family, from the Jurassic period, more than 180 million years ago. Because of its organic origin it is not considered a stone, but due to its features it is listed among precious materials. The word jet (Croatian: gagat) originates from Greek γαγάτης, Latin lapis gagates, after the town and river of Lycia, in the region in Asia Minor, where it was first discovered. Jet is very easily polished and {{can be used as a}} gemstone. It is highly inflammable, and when set on fire it has a very unpleasant smell. It becomes magnetised if rubbed with wool, just like amber. Although jet is not hard, it is hard enough to be worked, engraved and polished, but it requires great skill. It can also be given a sheen with oak oil. Jet is found in coal mines in the shape of round stones of different dimensions. The most famous deposits of jet in the world are in England (North Yorkshire, in the surroundings of the town of Whitby), in Germany (in the Rhine and Mosel river basins), in France (Languedoc), Spain (Asturia, the province of Oviedo), the United States of America (Colorado, Utah), the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and Portugal. It is found in amber mines in Germany, where it functions as a “coat” for the amber which it greatly resembles, and this is why it is also called <b>black</b> <b>amber.</b> Jet has been used for making jewellery ever since the Palaeolithic and Neolithic ages, but only in the Bronze Age was its full potential revealed, when the production of finely worked pieces of jewellery, bracelets, pearls, rings and similar items began. The use of jet as a gemstone also continued into the Iron Age and the Roman period. In Antiquity, it was also used for making jewellery: necklaces (threaded beads and grains of various sizes), pendants and medallions, bracelets, rings, hairpins, as well as whorls and spindles, knife handles, gaming chips, and various kinds of figurines - amulets. The Romans particularly valued jet for its alleged medicinal qualities. While working on cataloguing the materials in the depots of the Archaeological Museum in Zadar, I separated a large group of fragments that mostly have not been entered into the inventory or registered, as well as several complete bracelets and other artefacts made of jet and dark (black) glass. I managed to separate a group of fragments and artefacts made of jet and pseudo-jet from the holdings of the Museum - several hundreds of fragments - which are now being processed. I selected the most beautiful samples from this group, and have catalogued these 22 items in this paper. Among these pieces of jewellery, the most numerous are bracelets (armilla). A particularly interesting bracelet is the one from Zadar, on both sides of which two dog heads in relief are set toward the bracelet’s rectangular central part. I have not found any similar example in the literature available to me. Some people believe that jewellery made of jet was worn by the priests and priestesses of the Great Mother (Magna Mater) or Cybele, that is, the men and women introduced into the secrets of the Metroac religion. Why a dog, then? A dog is not a typical iconographic attribute of the Great Mother, but it appears in her iconography in Gaul, where the cult of the Great Mother was contaminated by Gallic Mothers (Matres), goddesses of fertility, waters, and health. I also processed three necklaces (monilia) made of threaded beads and several beads of various sizes. There are also several pendants among the finds. A pendant in the shape of an eagle’s head can be connected with an eagle as an attribute of the supreme Roman god - Jupiter, “the bird king,” the symbol of power, strength, and victory. It is also the symbol of the Roman state. Two of the pendants contain impressed male and female busts, and one of them only a female bust. Pendants with male and female busts are also called engagement medallions. According to their typology, two catalogued rings (anuli) do not differ from the metal rings. It is impossible to answer the question of the origin of these pieces of jewellery. There are indications that a jet workshop existed in Trier, Germany, but there are also investigators who are inclined toward the thesis that the jet found in Germany had been imported from England. It is impossible to answer this question, for these jet finds are insufficiently investigated. Indeed, it would primarily be necessary to determine the geological source of every single item made of jet. In Europe, artefacts made of jet and cheaper pseudo-jet are often found among the funerary gifts in the necropolises of the 3 rd and 4 th century, in Germany (Trier, Mainz, Bonn, Cologne, Gellep, Bregenz), then in Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, northern France and Belgium. Pseudo-jet is a somewhat less appreciated version of jet, and is therefore cheaper, for its structure is worse and its colour is brown and grey. The richest finds are from England, where the best quality jet originates from North Yorkshire, from the surroundings of the town of Whitby...|$|E
40|$|Throughout {{the year}} ending on November 16, 1935 {{extension}} work in Cherry County was administered cooperatively and {{sponsored by the}} following groups; namely, Board of County Commissioners; a County Extension Committee of seven members; a District AAA Wheat Control Association with headquarters at Ainsworth; a County AAA Corn-Hog Control Association, the Nebraska Resettlement Administration; and a tentative Farm Bureau organization. Slightly less than one-half of the agents time was devoted to developing the AAA programs for the year. Somewhat less than one-fourth of his time was devoted to Emergency Drouth relief activities including {{the close of the}} cattle buying. The remainder of his time was devoted to general extension activities. These extension activities included promotion and developing of 4 -H clubs, Clarke-McNary tree plantings, Pasture Improvement, Farm Records, Adult Womens Study Club and Home Demonstration Project clubs. Previous to 1935 very little 4 -H club work had been undertaken in this county. The records show ten members only, enrolled for 1934. The total enrollment for 1935 was 60 members in seven clubs. Two of these clubs completed the ten requirements necessary to win achievement seals. Thirty individual members of clubs have completed the work and have earned Achievement Certificates. At the close of the year seven clubs have enrolled 43 members for work which will be completed in 1936. During 1935 a total of 32, 200 Clarke-McNary seedlings were distributed to 37 cooperators in Cherry County. Of these seedling planted approximately 74 % have survived the first season. General bulletin service, including flock management has been extended Cherry County turkey growers. Plans for cooperative marketing have been outlined by mailings. Not enough information concerning the location of flocks is at hand to permit community demonstration work to be undertaken. The 1934 drouth damage to ranges presented the opportunity for carrying on a limited educational program on range and grass land improvement. The details of a system of deferred and rotation grazing practiced by some of the successful ranchers were distributed as information to all cattlemen. A survey of cattle by precincts was taken to determine the number of cattle on a given acreage. This information was used to show why some ranges were standing up good and others were not feeding the cattle well. An exhibit of various specimens of grasses was started. This will be developed to show competition of poor types of grasses in overgrazed areas. General assistance was given to all AAA signers with their record books. 648 records have been at least partly completed. Several have been completely and accurately maintained. More complete extension books {{are in the hands of}} a number who will complete records in order to get cost summaries prepared. The keeping of these records and their use for summary data will assist in farm management plans for the many visitors to the office requesting this service. Names of course will not be disclosed. Information was distributed to assist in the control of local damage from cut worms and scattered damage from other insects. No serious infestations were reported for the year 1935. A late summer migration of grasshoppers indicates an expectation of some damage in 1936. The office gave clerical assistance to local committees, assisting them in conducting the petitions and tabulations of signers requesting area test for Tuberculosis. Prior to 1935 on Adult Study Group Club with an enrollment of 22 was reported from Cherry County. At the close of the year five such clubs are reported with a total membership of 116. No Home Demonstration or Project club work had been attempted until this year. At the close of the year fifteen clubs have been organized. Five of these clubs were organized through Sheridan county office at Rushville. The remaining ten clubs were organized through the Valentine office and comprised of a total membership of 106. During the winter months and until May 15, 1935 nearly one-half of the entire time of the agent was given to the drouth program. This work includied assistance given to the AAA cattle buying administration, the Farm Credit Administration, and to local feed and seed service. In addition to the organized emergency drouth programs the movement of feed as a service to buyers and sellers continued through the winter with the bulk of movement coming in April. The total value of feed for livestock for which information service was given to local buyers was estimated to be close to $ 51, 980. 00. During the spring planting season 8000 bushel of oats were shipped in from the seed stocks supplies. Approximately 6500 bushels of locally grown seen corn was listed with samples displayed and buyers found. 225 bushels of <b>black</b> <b>amber</b> cane seed locally grown near Marriman was brought into the Valentine trade territory. About 900 bushel of rye was moved from growers to those requesting the see. Until the close of the year 1935 the AAA wheat contracts were administered from the District office at Ainsworth. 25 applications are on file for the new 1936 - 1939 wheat contract. Initial steps toward completing a program of 1936 - 1939 rye contracts are under way. Both wheat and rye contracts will be supervised through a Cherry County Grain Control Association with officers yet to be elected. 648 corn-hog contracts were transmitted to Washington for payment. These contracts transmitted represent a corn base of 69, 536 acres and a contracted reduction of 20, 597 acres. They represented a hog base of 25, 826 hogs and a 1935 permitted production of not to exceed 23, 892 head. Actual total acreage planted and a total production of hogs for market will be computed beginning December 2. Gross Benefit Payments totaled $ 166, 033. 95 as compared with $ 208, 199. 30 for the 1934 program. Administrative costs are estimated at $ 8100 as compared with $ 8550 for the 1934 year. The percentage cost is estimated to be slightly less than 5 %. The cost per contract has been reduced approximately 55 ¢ per contract...|$|E

40|$|The {{educational}} program of agricultural extension {{was conducted in}} Cherry County during 1940 by the Cherry County Extension Service. 329 families and business firms subscribed 1529. 15 for support of the work. The county commissioners provided office quarters {{at a cost of}} 258. 00 for the year. Other income provided 80. 00 additional funds making a total operating fund of 1867. 15. Expenditures for the year were 255. 00 for office quarters, heat and light, 89. 60 finance committee expense, and 1824. 14 for conducting the general program. The program of work directed special emphasis to F-F-L, Beef Cattle, 4 -H and Project club work. Test plats of sorghum varieties showed Leoti as superior to other varieties with a green weight yield of 9. 5 tons. This compares with 8 tons for <b>black</b> <b>amber,</b> 7. 2 tons for early sumac with other varieties scaling considerably lower. Grain sorghums were again unsuccessful because of early freezing weather. Results obtained by the Valentine Experiment station do not show enough superiority of hybrid corn over local varieties to justify the added expense. One good stand of Hardistan alfalfa has survived dry weather and is a profitable seed crop. Experimental seedings of strawberry clover in alkali spots; red top, timothy, red and alsike clovers, reed canary grass in wet meadows; and crested wheat grass for dry abandoned cropland areas are being conducted. Greater success with the vegetable garden has been reported by 150 farm and ranch homes due to this year 2 ̆ 7 s Extension program. Timely help for all gardeners in the county has been given. Yard beautification improvements were made in not less than 400 yards at the homes of Cherry County ranchers, farmers, and townspeople, {{as a result of the}} attention given to this phase of the Extension program during 1940. Records were made of some of these improvements. 89 homes followed recommendations for planting shrubs and trees. 98 homes planted new lawns or improved existing lawns according to recommendations made. 69 homes corrected walks, drives, and fences to improve the appearance of their home yards. 80 new yard fences were constructed. 50 yard fences were changed. 88 unsightly views were screened with hedges or constructed screens. 286 homes reported a general clean-up on their yards. These records were obtained as a part of the yard beautification demonstration for project clubs. In addition it is known that many other improvements were made of which no records were taken. 52 cooperators planted 23, 700 Clarke-McNary seedlings to form windbreaks. 113 farmers planted trees as a part of their compliance with the Agricultural Conservation cropland program on 335 acres of windbreak. 81 homemakers reported planting trees for erosion control as a part of the home demonstration program for women 2 ̆ 7 s project clubs. 75 homes in the town of Valentine cooperated with a plan developed by the Junior Chamber of Commerce to stimulate interest in tree planting. There is some duplication in these reports obtained through the above mentioned sources. It is conservatively estimated that 265 different plantings of trees were made during 1940. This number compares with 140 for 1939 when estimated on the same basis. 108 homes were repaired. Major repairs were made in 8 homes; 1 water system was installed; 2 light plants placed; 2 poultry houses constructed; 1 complete new barn constructed; built-in kitchen cabinets were installed in 2 homes; 1 house was remodeled; copies were made of a feature of 40 hay equipment machines; 21 chicken feeders and mail boxes were completed as 4 -H projects. 4 meadows were drained; 1 meadow and 5 garden irrigation systems were installed. These reports of accomplishments are listed as those definitely assisted by the Extension program during 1940. Help with poultry rations was extended to 68 turkey growers and a few chicken growers. Regular monthly turkey bulletins prepared at the state office in Lincoln were forwarded by this office to the turkey growers in the county. 38 farm security clients were given assistance to increase production and improve the quality of milk and cream. The county fair, a spring and fall show sponsored by the Northwest Hereford Breeders 2 ̆ 7 Association, a district calf show at Mullen serving the south part of Cherry County, were exhibits for competitive quality improvement. These were the methods employed to bring to the attention of ranchers in the county the possibilities for beef cattle herd improvement. Nearly every rancher in the county was given information concerning control of Bang 2 ̆ 7 s Disease, hemorrhagic, and such specific troubles as calf diptheria, foul foot, retention of urine, grass tetany, white scours, and blackleg. Office interviews, discussion meetings, and circular mailings were the methods used. Assistance to the Sandhills Feeder Cattle Producers 2 ̆ 7 Association and other livestock organizations in the county was given both by the state office and the county Extension office. With over 42, 000 head of feeder cattle, and the offerings of purebred breeders, it is estimated that the total value of livestock sold by individuals participating in these organizations is in excess of 3, 500, 000. 00 for 1940. Rations and feeding practices came under discussion in office interviews, at meetings, and at farm and ranch visits. Soybean cake vs. cottonseed cake as a source of protein was given particular attention. Our recommendations were that soybean cake should be fed in preference to cottonseed cake when the latter is 4. 00 or more per ton higher in price than the former. When soybean cake is fed, phosphorus mineral should be offered ad lib. Sheep feed requirements for wintering, care of the ewe at lambing time, stomach worm control, and wool marketing information was given to 90 sheep growers in the county. 77 farmers and ranchers cooperated in the 1940 Pasture-Forage-Livestock program. Each contributed an outline of his methods. This program was conducted as a research or study of management methods as found on the ranches when visited. 243 weekly news stories concerning the Extension program in Cherry County were submitted to all or a part of 5 newspapers published in the county, and 6 published at stations outside the county borders. 55 circular letters announcing events or discussing subject matter were mailed. 1926 personal letters were written from the county office. 409 ladies enrolled in 31 project clubs for the year 1939 - 1940. Training centers for leaders were conducted at Valentine, Merriman, Gordon, Hyannis, Mullen, and Thedford. 15 clubs were represented at the Valentine Center, 7 at Merriman, 4 at Gordon, 3 at Hyannis, and 3 at Mullen. At Thedford, members from Cherry County enrolled in Thomas County clubs. The demonstrations given this year were Read for Facts and Sing for Fun, Company Dinners, Merry Christmas for the Home, Table Service, Care and Repair of Walls and Floors, and The Livable Home. 21 4 -H clubs were organized. 104 boys and 70 girls enrolled for 196 projects. In addition 29 associate members enrolled for as many projects. Of these associate members enrolled 13 were boys and 16 were girls. 62 boys and 39 girls finished their projects as achievement members. In addition 13 associate members earned achievement certificates. The county Extension office was given charge of the 4 -H, handicraft, floral, project club, foods and needlework divisions of the exhibit section of the county fair. Assistance was given by the Extension leaders in the crops and poultry divisions and in a general livestock exhibit. 22 communities participated in programs of entertainment, recreation, and discussion of timely economic topics. A series of 16 such community gatherings in 14 communities was conducted during the fall. The title 2 ̆ 2 Community Roundups 2 ̆ 2 was coined to designate a type of these special community events. A total attendance of 3700 was recorded for the events both spring and fall. In addition 4 project club achievement days with an attendance of 727; 2 rural youth meetings with an attendance of 300, and 1 recreation meeting sponsored by the Kennedy community with an attendance of over 100, were conducted. The question of 2 ̆ 2 Shall an appropriation be made annually from the general fund of the county for the support of Agricultural Extension work? 2 ̆ 2 received approval at the November 5 election. The final canvass of ballots totaled 2399 for and 1655 against. This method of financing will be much simpler than the method followed heretofore of soliciting for volunteer subscriptions. It will remove much of the difficulties which have confronted the directors and called for a great deal of their attention. This change will also eliminate the need for constant attention to finances by the office personnel...|$|E
