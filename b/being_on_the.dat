5|$|Ice {{was also}} transported by {{railroad}} from 1841 onwards, the {{first use of}} the technique <b>being</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> track laid down between Fresh Pond and Charleston by the Charlestown Branch Railroad Company.

Ice was not a popular cargo with railway employees, however, as {{it had to be}} moved promptly to avoid melting and was generally awkward to transport. By the 1880s ice was being shipped by rail across the North American continent.|$|E

5|$|Mk. III {{went into}} {{extensive}} testing at No. 25 Sqn in May 1940 and another troubling problem was found. As the target aircraft {{moved to the}} sides of the fighter, the error in the horizontal angle grew. Eventually, at about 60 degrees to the side, the target was indicated as <b>being</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side of the fighter. Hanbury Brown concluded that the problem was due to reflections between the fuselage and engine nacelles, due to the change to the long-nose IVF from the short-nose IF and IIF. In previous examples they had used the fuselage of the aircraft as the reflector, positioning and angling the antennas to run along the nose or wing leading edges.|$|E
