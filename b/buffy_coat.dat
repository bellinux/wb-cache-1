5|$|The {{presence}} of T. cruzi is diagnostic of Chagas disease. It {{can be detected}} by microscopic examination of fresh anticoagulated blood, or its <b>buffy</b> <b>coat,</b> for motile parasites; or by preparation of thin and thick blood smears stained with Giemsa, for direct visualization of parasites. Microscopically, T. cruzi can be confused with Trypanosoma rangeli, which is not known to be pathogenic in humans. Isolation of T. cruzi can occur by inoculation into mice, by culture in specialized media (for example, NNN, LIT); and by xenodiagnosis, where uninfected Reduviidae bugs are fed on the patient's blood, and their gut contents examined for parasites.|$|E
25|$|Trypanosomes can be {{detected}} from patient samples using two different preparations. A wet preparation {{can be used to}} look for the motile trypanosomes. Alternatively, a fixed (dried) smear can be stained using Giemsa's or Field's technique and examined under a microscope. Often, the parasite is in relatively low abundance in the sample, so techniques to concentrate the parasites can be used prior to microscopic examination. For blood samples, these include centrifugation followed by examination of the buffy coat; mini anion-exchange/centrifugation; and the quantitative <b>buffy</b> <b>coat</b> (QBC) technique. For other samples, such as spinal fluid, concentration techniques include centrifugation followed by examination of the sediment.|$|E
25|$|Microfilarial {{detection}} {{was accomplished}} most commonly {{in the past}} by the microscopic identification of microfilariae on a direct blood smear, above the <b>buffy</b> <b>coat</b> in a microhematocrit tube (or capillary tube), using the , or after millipore filtration. The accuracy of these tests, typically used for routine screening or diagnosis of heartworm infection, is improved by multiple testing. The modified Knott test and millipore filtration are more sensitive because they concentrate microfilariae, improving the chance of diagnosis. The direct smear technique allows examination of larval motion, helping in the distinction of D. immitis from Acanthocheilonema reconditum. This distinction is important because {{the presence of the}} latter parasite does not require expensive and potentially harmful therapy. However, the potential for a microfilaremic infections is 5-67%. The number of circulating microfilariae does not correlate with the number of adult heartworms, so is not an indicator of disease severity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Influenza A {{virus has}} been {{detected}} {{in the blood of}} some infected individuals, and may pose a safety concern for collection, handling and transport of specimens for epidemiological and public health investigations if infectious virus is present in samples. Furthermore the effect of storage on virus stability and infectivity has not been well studied. Methods We examined the stability of novel pandemic influenza A (H 1 N 1) virus RNA when the virus was stored in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), plasma, or <b>buffy</b> <b>coated</b> blood at either room temperature or 4 °C using a sensitive Taqman RT-PCR assay. We also investigated virus infectivity using the EID 50 assay when virus was stored in PBS, plasma, or <b>buffy</b> <b>coats</b> isolated from blood at 4 °C. Results Viral RNA stability was affected by the matrix used for storage. The recovery of viral RNA was highest when virus was stored in PBS with lower amounts being recovered from plasma and <b>buffy</b> <b>coats</b> at either room temperature or 4 °C. Incubation time {{did not appear to be}} a major factor for viral RNA stability, although there was gradual decline after longer periods post-incubation. Both sample matrix and incubation time affected virus infectivity. The decay in virus infectivity was greatest in PBS followed by <b>buffy</b> <b>coats</b> and plasma. Virus infectivity was abolished in <b>buffy</b> <b>coats</b> at day 20 post-incubation when virus concentrations were low. Conclusion These data indicate that encapsidated viral RNA was stable overall in all three liquid matrices at room temperature or 4 °C although it was most stable in PBS; virus infectivity in <b>buffy</b> <b>coats</b> at 4 °C decayed in a time dependent manner while it remained unchanged in plasma. These findings have implications for storage, handling and transport of blood derived samples from influenza patients for epidemiological and laboratory investigations. It should be noted that there is little known about influenza viremia, and whether influenza viruses can be transmitted by blood or blood derived samples. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{photochemical}} treatment (PCT) {{process for}} inactivation of infectious pathogens and leukocytes {{has been developed}} and evaluated using single-donor platelet concentrates. This study assessed the application of PCT to platelets prepared from pooled <b>buffy</b> <b>coats.</b> In this study, in vitro functional characteristics of PCT platelets were compared to control platelets prepared from pooled <b>buffy</b> <b>coats</b> using the approved platelet-additive solution T-Sol®. Platelets in platelet PAS III additive solution without PCT were evaluated as well. PCT also included {{the use of a}} psoralen (S- 59) reduction device (SRD). Materials and Methods: Four types of platelet concentrates were compared: (1) platelet concentrate in plasma/T-Sol; (2) platelet concentrate in plasma/PAS III; (3) platelet concentrate in plasma/PAS III, PCT, 9 h SRD and (4) platelet concentrate in plasma/PAS III, PCT, 16 h SRD. PCT occurred on the day after whole-blood collection. In vitro assay parameters included: pH, pO 2, pCO 2, HCO 3,/ - platelet count, mean platelet volume, plasma glucose, plasma lactate, total ATP, expression of p-selectin, hypotonic shock response and electron microscopy. Results: The results indicate that PCT is compatible with platelet concentrates prepared from pooled <b>buffy</b> <b>coats</b> for up to 7 days of storage.

40|$|Abstract Background Genomic tumor information, such as {{identification}} of amplified oncogenes, {{can be used}} to plan treatment. The two sources of a brain tumor that are commonly available include formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections from the small diagnostic biopsy and the ultrasonic surgical aspiration that contains the bulk of the tumor. In research centers, frozen tissue of a brain tumor may also be available. This study compared ultrasonic surgical aspiration and FFPE specimens from the same brain tumors for retrieval of DNA and molecular assessment of amplified oncogenes. Methods Surgical aspirations were centrifuged to separate erythrocytes from the tumor cells that predominantly formed large, overlying <b>buffy</b> <b>coats.</b> These were sampled to harvest nuclear pellets for DNA purification. Four glioblastomas, 2 lung carcinoma metastases, and an ependymoma were tested. An inexpensive PCR technique, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), quantified 79 oncogenes using 3 kits. Copy number (CN) results were normalized to DNA from non-neoplastic brain (NB) in calculated ratios, [tumor DNA]/[NB DNA]. Bland-Altman and Spearman rank correlative comparisons were determined.

40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{investigated}} the effects of ozone on human blood, {{as well as on}} resuspended <b>buffy</b> <b>coats</b> and Ficoll-purified mononuclear cells. Samples were exposed at different ozone concentrations (from 2. 2 micrograms to 108 micrograms/ml) for 30 sec and then incubated for different times at 37 degrees C in a 95 % air- 5 % CO 2 humidified atmosphere. Supernatants were collected and frozen at- 20 degrees C until tested for interferon (IFN) activity. We have determined that the ozone concentration is critical for lymphokine induction. In fact, while low concentrations (2. 2 micrograms/ml) are effective in lymphocytes, they do not induce IFN in either whole or diluted (1 : 1) human blood, or resuspended <b>buffy</b> <b>coats.</b> In such cases levels as high as 42 micrograms/ml are required. On the other hand, a very high ozone concentration (108 micrograms/ml) is not effective and probably toxic. Maximal IFN production occurs 72 - 96 h after ozone exposure, and the kinetics of IFN release is similar to that after Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B addition.

40|$|During {{the last}} century, {{transfusion}} of blood components has become a prerequisite for treatment in many clinical settings. The availability of plastic bags and methods for centrifugation and separation of blood cells, has enabled processing of whole blood into blood cell components, and {{made it possible to}} optimize transfusion therapy, as well as storage conditions. Automation of the processes has been introduced, which increases reproducibility and standardization of the prepared components. Recommendations of leukocyte reduction to minimize side-effects caused by concomitant leukocytes have resulted in development in different types of filters. Today, universal leukocyte reduction is practice in many countries and in Sweden, a majority of the blood components are leukocyte reduced. For the immunosuppressed patients, who are at risk of developing transfusion associated graft-versus host disease attributed to passenger T-lymphocytes, there is need for further treatment of the blood components to restrain the proliferation of T-lymphocytes, and hence prevent TA-GVHD. The prevalent method has been gamma irradiation, and in recent years X-ray irradiation has been available as another alternative to gamma irradiation from radioactive sources. The studies included in the present thesis focus on 1) preparation techniques for leukocyte reduction of whole blood which saves platelet, and results in preparation of erythrocytes, plasma and platelets, 2) automated preparation of leukocyte reduced platelets from pooled <b>buffy</b> <b>coats</b> and standardization of platelet content by selection of <b>buffy</b> <b>coats,</b> 3) evaluation of platelet additive solutions with different composition, with the aim to optimize storage conditions and 4) effects of gamma- and X-ray irradiation on platelets during storage. The results indicate that leukocyte reduction of whole blood with a filter that saves platelets results in blood components with sufficiently low leukocytes, satisfactory recovery of erythrocytes and platelets, and high quality as measured by in vitro parameters, which were maintained during storage. Automated preparation with OrbiSac of leukocyte reduced platelets from pooled <b>buffy</b> <b>coats</b> and standardization of platelet content by selection of <b>buffy</b> <b>coats</b> was introduced. Prepared platelets displayed in vitro characteristics during storage for 7 days, equivalent to the previous manual method. Moreover, the platelet count variation was reduced. Evaluation of different platelet additive solutions concluded that addition of phosphate is beneficial for storage of platelets. This finding has had an impact on development of the next generations of platelet additive solutions. Effects of different irradiation equipments were studied. No major deleterious effects of gamma irradiation on platelets during storage were identified. For X-ray irradiation previous data are scarce especially for platelets and our results imply that X-ray irradiation does not compromise the quality of platelets during storage for 7 days.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The effect of prestorage filtration of buffy coat-prepared platelet concentrates (PCs) on platelet function, metabolism, and activation was investigated. A pool of three PCs, each made of four <b>buffy</b> <b>coats,</b> was split into three equal volumes; two were filtered over two different filters and the third served as a control. Variables monitored immediately after filtration and during the subsequent 8 -day storage period at 22 degrees C included aggregation upon stimulation with collagen and/or ADP, platelet adhesion capacity to collagen and fibrinogen in flowing blood, nucleotide content of and nucleobase release by the platelets, expression of activation-dependent antigens, and beta-thromboglobulin release by the platelets.
