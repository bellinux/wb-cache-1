The tank contents consist of three forms: dissolved salt solution, other waste salt solutions, and sludge containing settled solids. This paper focuses on developing the computational model and estimating the operation time of submersible slurry pump when the tank contents are adequately blended prior to their transfer to the SWPF facility. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics approach was taken by using the full scale configuration of SRS Type-IV tank, Tank 21 H. Major solid obstructions such as the tank wall boundary, the transfer pump column, and three slurry pump housings including one active and two inactive pumps were included in the mixing performance model. Basic flow pattern results predicted by the computational model were benchmarked against the SRNL test results and literature data. Tank 21 is a waste tank that is used to prepare batches of salt feed for SWPF. The salt feed must be a homogeneous solution satisfying the acceptance criterion of the solids entrainment during transfer operation. The work scope described here consists of two modeling areas. They are the steady state flow pattern calculations before the addition of acid solution for <b>tank</b> <b>blending</b> operation and the transient mixing analysis during miscible liquid blending operation. The transient blending calculations were performed by using the 95 % homogeneity criterion for the entire liquid domain of the tank.

40|$|The Salt Disposition Integration (SDI) {{portfolio}} of projects provides the infrastructure within existing Liquid Waste facilities {{to support the}} startup and long term operation of the Salt Waste Processing Facility (SWPF). Within SDI, the Blend and Feed Project will equip existing waste tanks in the Tank Farms to serve as Blend Tanks where 300, 000 - 800, 000 gallons of salt solution will be blended in 1. 3 million gallon tanks and qualified for use as feedstock for SWPF. Blending requires the miscible salt solutions from potentially multiple source tanks per batch to be well mixed without disturbing settled sludge solids that may be present in a Blend Tank. Disturbing solids may be problematic both from a feed quality perspective {{as well as from}} a process safety perspective where hydrogen release from the sludge is a potential flammability concern. To develop the necessary technical basis for the design and operation of blending equipment, Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) completed scaled blending and transfer pump tests and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling. A 94 inch diameter pilot-scale <b>blending</b> <b>tank,</b> including tank internals such as the blending pump, transfer pump, removable cooling coils, and center column, were used in this research. The test tank represents a 1 / 10. 85 scaled version of an 85 foot diameter, Type IIIA, nuclear waste tank that may be typical of Blend Tanks used in SDI. Specifically, Tank 50 was selected as the tank to be modeled per the SRR, Project Engineering Manager. SRNL blending tests investigated various fixed position, non-rotating, dual nozzle pump designs, including a blending pump model provided by the blend pump vendor, Curtiss Wright (CW). Primary research goals were to assess blending times and to evaluate incipient sludge disturbance for waste tanks. Incipient sludge disturbance was defined by SRR and SRNL as minor blending of settled sludge from the tank bottom into suspension due to blending pump operation, where the sludge level was shown to remain constant. To experimentally model the sludge layer, a very thin, pourable, sludge simulant was conservatively used for all testing. To experimentally model the liquid, supernate layer above the sludge in waste tanks, two salt solution simulants were used, which provided a bounding range of supernate properties. One solution was water (H{sub 2 }O + NaOH), and the other was an inhibited, more viscous salt solution. The research performed and data obtained significantly advances the understanding of fluid mechanics, mixing theory and CFD modeling for nuclear waste tanks by benchmarking CFD results to actual experimental data. This research significantly bridges the gap between previous CFD models and actual field experiences in real waste tanks. A finding of the 2009, DOE, Slurry Retrieval, Pipeline Transport and Plugging, and Mixing Workshop was that CFD models were inadequate to assess blending processes in nuclear waste tanks. One recommendation from that Workshop was that a validation, or bench marking program be performed for CFD modeling versus experiment. This research provided experimental data to validate and correct CFD models as they apply to mixing and blending in nuclear waste tanks. Extensive SDI research was a significant step toward bench marking and applying CFD modeling. This research showed that CFD models not only agreed with experiment, but demonstrated that the large variance in actual experimental data accounts for misunderstood discrepancies between CFD models and experiments. Having documented this finding, SRNL was able to provide correction factors to be used with CFD models to statistically bound full scale CFD results. Through the use of pilot scale tests performed for both types of pumps and available engineering literature, SRNL demonstrated how to effectively apply CFD results to salt batch mixing in full scale waste tanks. In other words, CFD models were in error prior to development of experimental correction factors determined during this research, which provided a technique to use CFD models for salt batch mixing and transfer pump operations. This major scientific advance in mixing technology resulted in multi-million dollar cost savings to SRR. New techniques were developed for both experiment and analysis to complete this research. Supporting this success, research findings are summarized in the Conclusions section of this report, and technical recommendations for design and operation are included in this section of the report...|$|E

Often, however, biosolids odors diminish marketability of biosolids, bring community opposition or, {{in the worst}} case, cause to ban the biosolids land application program. This dissertation is aiming to develop practical biosolids odor prediction models {{that can be applied}} for biosolids management on daily basis using the existing data available at the wastewater treatment plant and at the application sites as explanatory variables. Therefore, biosolids producer can use the plant odor predicting models to early detect and notify the hauling contractor when malodorous biosolids are anticipated. With the field odor models, malodorous products can be allocated accordingly to the appropriate sites in preventing the odor complaints from the communities. First, biosolids odors prediction models at wastewater treatment plant were developed using linear regression analysis and categorical data analysis. Biosolids odor was predicted in terms of detection threshold (DT) concentration and class of biosolids odor (odorous or non-odorous). Variables influencing biosolids odor levels at the plant were the percent solids and temperature of biosolids, percentage of the gravity thickener solids (GT) in the <b>blend</b> <b>tank,</b> pH of the GT solids, concentration of the return activated sludge (RAS) at the secondary process, and number of centrifuges running.

Last, a biosolids odors prediction model for use at field site was developed using ordered logit model. Various variables at the field site (i. e. weather conditions, odor measurement time of the day, wind condition, temperature, and inspector odor sensitivity) were included in the analysis.

The other is to estimate the elevation in the tank at which the transfer pump inlet should be located where the solid concentration of the entrained fluid remains below the acceptance criterion (0. 09 wt% or 1200 mg/liter) during transfer operation to the SWPF. Tank 50 H is a Waste Tank that will be used to prepare batches of salt feed for SWPF. The salt feed must be a homogeneous solution satisfying the acceptance criterion of the solids entrainment during transfer operation. The work described here consists of two modeling areas. They are the mixing modeling analysis during miscible liquid blending operation, and the flow pattern analysis during transfer operation of the blended liquid.

40|$|The {{problem of}} fouling on heat {{exchanger}} surfaces {{has been one}} of the major unresolved problems of the hydrotreatment unit at the Homs oil refinery in Syria. In this unit, a feed stream of straight-run naphtha is preheated in a series of four heat exchangers prior to the hydrotreater. Severe fouling conditions led to an overall reduction in the performance of the unit as a result of lower temperatures at the heat exchangers outlet and increased pressure drop. An investigation of the cause or causes of this problem was called for. For this purpose, deposits from the heat exchanger surfaces were analyzed in order to identify the fouling mechanism(s). Such analysis pointed unmistakably to fouling due to polymerization in general and oxygen-initiated polymerization in particular. Various laboratory tests were also conducted on the naphtha feed stream, which provided indications of the stream's polymerization potential. Since the naphtha feed stream was drawn from <b>blending</b> <b>tanks</b> that are not very well blanketed, the naphtha must clearly be exposed to atmospheric oxygen.

40|$|A {{sample of}} PUREX sludge from Tank 4 was characterized, and {{subsequently}} {{combined with a}} Tank 51 sample (Tank 51 -E 1) received following Al dissolution, but prior to a supernate decant by the Tank Farm, to perform a settling and washing study to support Sludge Batch 6 preparation. The sludge source {{for the majority of}} the Tank 51 -E 1 sample is Tank 12 HM sludge. The Tank 51 -E 1 sample was decanted by SRNL prior to use in the settling and washing study. The Tank 4 sample was analyzed for chemical composition including noble metals. The characterization of the Tank 51 -E 1 sample, used here in combination with the Tank 4 sample, was reported previously. SRNL analyses on Tank 4 were requested by Liquid Waste Engineering (LWE) via Technical Task Request (TTR) HLE-TTR- 2009 - 103. The sample preparation work is governed by Task Technical and Quality Assurance Plan (TTQAP), and analyses were controlled by an Analytical Study Plan and modifications received via customer communications. Additional scope included a request for a settling study of decanted Tank 51 -E 1 and a <b>blend</b> of decanted <b>Tank</b> 51 -E 1 and Tank 4, as well as a washing study to look into the fate of undissolved sulfur observed during the Tank 4 characterization. The chemistry of the Tank 4 sample was modeled with OLI Systems, Inc. StreamAnalyzer to determine the likelihood that sulfate could exist in this sample as insoluble Burkeite (2 Na{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 } {center_dot} Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 }). The OLI model was also used to predict the composition of the <b>blended</b> <b>tank</b> materials for the washing study. The following conclusions were drawn from the Tank 4 analytical results reported here: (1) Any projected <b>blend</b> of <b>Tank</b> 4 and the current Tank 51 contents will produce a SB 6 composition that is lower in Ca and U than the current SB 5 composition being processed by DWPF. (2) Unwashed Tank 4 has a relatively large initial S concentration of 3. 68 wt% on a total solids basis, and approximately 10 % of the total S is present as an insoluble or undissolved form. (3) There is 19 % more S than can be accounted for by IC sulfate measurement. This additional soluble S is detected by ICP-AES analysis of the supernate. (4) Total supernate and slurry sulfur by ICP-AES should be monitored during washing in addition to supernate sulfate in order to avoid under estimating the amount of sulfur species removed or remaining in the supernate. (5) OLI simulation calculations show that the presence of undissolved Burkeite in the Tank 4 sample is reasonable, assuming a small difference in the Na concentration that is well within the analytical uncertainties of the reported value. The following conclusions were drawn from the <b>blend</b> studies of <b>Tank</b> 4 and decanted Tank 51 -E 1 : (1) The addition of Tank 4 slurry to a decanted Tank 51 -E 1 sample significantly improved the degree and time for settling. (2) The addition of Tank 4 slurry to a decanted Tank 51 -E 1 sample significantly improved the plastic viscosity and yield stress. (3) The SRNL washing test, where nearly all of the wash solution was decanted from the solids, indicates that approximately 96 % or more of the total S was removed from the blend in these tests, and the removal of the sulfur tracks closely with that of Na. Insoluble (undissolved) S remaining in the washed sludge was calculated from an estimate of the final slurry liquid fraction, the S result in the slurry digestion, and the S in the final decant (which was very close to the method detection limit). Based on this calculated result, about 4 % of the initial total S remained after these washes; this amount is equivalent to about 18 % of the initially undissolved S...|$|R

These tanks were evaluated here to determine blending times, to determine a range of settling times for disturbed sludge, and to determine that the SWPF Waste Acceptance Criteria that less than 1200 mg/liter of solids will be entrained in salt solutions during transfers from the Tank 21 and Tank 24 will be met. Overall conclusions for Tank 21 and Tank 24 operations include: (1) Experimental correction factors were applied to CFD (computational fluid dynamics) models to establish blending times between approximately two and five hours. As shown in Phase 2 research, blending times may be as much as ten times greater, or more, if lighter fluids are added to heavier fluids (i. e., water added to salt solution). As the densities of two salt solutions converge this effect may be minimized, but additional confirmatory research was not performed. (2) At the current sludge levels and the presently planned operating heights of the transfer pumps, solids entrainment will be less than 1200 mg/liter, assuming a conservative, slow settling sludge simulant. (3) Based on theoretical calculations, particles in the density range of 2. 5 to 5. 0 g/mL must be greater than 2 - 4 {micro}m in diameter to ensure they settle adequately in 30 - 60 days to meet the SWPF feed criterion ( 60 days) settling times in Tank 21...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} effect of feed {{composition}} {{on the performance of}} the high-level vitrification process. It is assumed in this study that the tank wastes are retrieved and <b>blended</b> by <b>tank</b> farms, producing 12 different blends from the single-shell <b>tank</b> farms, two <b>blends</b> of double-shell <b>tank</b> waste, and a separately defined all-tank blend. This blending scenario was chosen only for evaluating the impact of composition on the volume of high- level waste glass produced. Special glass compositions were formulated for each waste blend based on glass property models and the properties of similar glasses. These glasses were formulated to meet the applicable viscosity, electrical conductivity, and liquidus temperature constraints for the identified candidate melters. Candidate melters in this study include the low-temperature stirred melter, which operates at 1050 {degrees}C; the reference Hanford Waste Vitrification Plant liquid-fed ceramic melter, which operates at 1150 {degrees}C; and the high-temperature, joule-heated melter and the cold-crucible melter, which operate over a temperature range of 1150 {degrees}C to 1400 {degrees}C. In the most conservative case, it is estimated that 61, 000 MT of glass will be produced if the Site`s high-level wastes are retrieved by tank farms and processed in the reference joule-heated melter. If an all-tank blend was processed under the same conditions, the reference melter would produce 21, 250 MT of glass. If cross-tank blending were used, it is anticipated that $ 2. 0 billion could be saved in repository disposal costs (based on an average disposal cost of $ 217, 000 per canister) by blending the S, SX, B, and T Tank Farm wastes with other wastes prior to vitrification. General blending among all the tank farms is expected to produce great potential benefit...|$|R
40|$|The Department of Energy has a {{large number}} of nuclear waste tanks. It is {{important}} to know if fissionable materials can concentrate when waste is transferred from staging tanks prior to feeding waste treatment plants. Specifically, there is a concern that large, dense particles, e. g., plutonium containing, could accumulate in poorly mixed regions of a <b>blend</b> <b>tank</b> heel for tanks that employ mixing jet pumps. At the request of the DOE Hanford Tank Operations Contractor, Washington River Protection Solutions, the Engineering Development Laboratory of the Savannah River National Laboratory performed a scouting study in a 1 / 22 -scale model of a waste tank to investigate this concern and to develop measurement techniques that could be applied in a more extensive study at a larger scale. Simulated waste tank solids and supernatant were charged to the test tank and rotating liquid jets were used to remove most of the solids. Then the volume and shape of the residual solids and the spatial concentration profiles for the surrogate for plutonium were measured. This paper discusses the overall test results, which indicated heavy solids only accumulate during the first few transfer cycles, along with the techniques and equipment designed and employed in the test. Those techniques include: Magnetic particle separator to remove stainless steel solids, the plutonium surrogate from a flowing stream; Magnetic wand used to manually remove stainless steel solids from samples and the tank heel; Photographs were used to determine the volume and shape of the solids mounds by developing a composite of topographical areas; Laser rangefinders to determine the volume and shape of the solids mounds; Core sampler to determine the stainless steel solids distribution within the solids mounds; Computer driven positioner that placed the laser rangefinders and the core sampler over solids mounds that accumulated on the bottom of a scaled staging tank in locations where jet velocities were low. These devices and techniques were very effective to estimate the movement, location, and concentrations of the solids representing plutonium and are expected to perform well at a larger scale. The operation of the techniques and their measurement accuracies will be discussed as well as the overall results of the accumulated solids test...|$|R
