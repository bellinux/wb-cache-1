5|$|As {{it turned}} out, maybe Hadl {{had led him}} {{to believe that we}} had come down to reach some sort of {{monetary}} settlement with him. And it was really funny <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> what he was expecting and his reaction was shock.|$|E
5|$|However, Vulcan was {{unacceptable}} to the IAU <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{the name of}} an underworld figure and had already been used for a hypothetical planet inside the orbit of Mercury, as well as having given its name to the vulcanoids.|$|E
5|$|Of all {{the summits}} {{that make up}} the Metacomet Ridge, West Rock, in New Haven, Connecticut, bears special mention <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> formed by the {{volcanic}} flooding that created most of the traprock ridges. Rather, it is the remains of an enormous volcanic dike through which the basalt lava floods found access to the surface.|$|E
50|$|The simple {{continued}} fraction expansion of Champernowne's constant {{has been studied}} as well. Kurt Mahler showed that the constant is transcendental; therefore its {{continued fraction}} does <b>not</b> terminate (<b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> rational) and <b>is</b> aperiodic (<b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> an irreducible quadratic).|$|R

5|$|Although the Congress of Tucumán {{had already}} formalized {{the flag of}} Argentina, the Army of the Andes did not use it, {{choosing}} a banner with two columns, light blue and white, and a coat of arms roughly similar to the Coat of arms of Argentina. The army {{did not use the}} flag of Argentina <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> exclusively an Argentine army.|$|E
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{possible}} to upgrade Gardner Hall, a new modern block, Orchard Hall, {{was built to}} replace it. Gardner became an assessment centre for prospective students. In September 2009 Gardner was made available as a venue for hire for functions such as weddings. In addition to the halls of residence, the college also owns several houses {{both on and off}} campus which enable students to gain a greater level of independent living. There is a restaurant which provides meals, or students can choose to be self-catering. All accommodation has kitchen facilities.|$|E
5|$|In Chouteau v. Molony (1853), Justice Wayne, for a {{unanimous}} Court, interpreted {{a grant from}} the Fox tribe to be a mere right to mine lead, rather than a grant of land <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> confirmed by the Spanish authorities as required by Spanish law and because it included a Fox village which the tribe would have been unlikely to cede.|$|E

5|$|The Nyasaland African Congress (NAC) was {{particularly}} vocal about increased African {{representation in the}} Nyasaland Legislative Council, demanding in September 1957 an African majority in the council. Nyasaland's inclusion in the federation was never a goal of its proponents, it was there primarily <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> economically viable by itself. Welensky did not understand or appreciate the party's goal of increased African representation or secession when it relied on the federation for its well being.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} Boom Box {{received}} very little coverage from music critics <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a studio album. The few reviews it received were positive. The album charted at number 206 on the Top Internet Albums. However, in its separate release, The Singles 1992–2003 was reviewed widely and positively, and it charted highly across North America and Europe, peaking at number 2 in the US and number 5 in the UK. Everything in Time, in its separate release, charted on the US Billboard 200 at number 182.|$|E
5|$|Concorde had livery restrictions; the {{majority}} of the surface had to be covered with a highly reflective white paint to avoid overheating the aluminium structure due to heating effects from supersonic flight at Mach 2. The white finish reduced the skin temperature by 6 to 11 degrees Celsius. In 1996, Air France briefly painted F-BTSD in a predominantly blue livery, {{with the exception of the}} wings, in a promotional deal with Pepsi. In this paint scheme, Air France was advised to remain at Mach 2 for no more than 20 minutes at a time, but there was no restriction at speeds under Mach 1.7. F-BTSD was used <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> scheduled for any long flights that required extended Mach 2 operations.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} bankruptcy, Rail Management {{established}} a new company, Ofotbanen Drift AS, {{to take over}} the estate in bankruptcy. They also stated that the cause of the bankruptcy was that Autolink had not let them make a private placement of NOK 10 million. The new company received an operation and safety licence from the inspectorate in January 2009, and plans to start operation again in February. On 9 April 2010, the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate withdrew Ofotbanen's operating certificate <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> economically sound to operate. The company filed for bankruptcy in May, after the Norwegian Tax Administration could not claim NOK700,000 in due taxes.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Amedy (1826), the Court {{held that}} the federal {{criminal}} insurance fraud statute was no subjected to the same formalities as civil insurance fraud claims. First, the Court {{held that the}} state statute of incorporation of the insurance company required {{no more than the}} state's seal to be authenticated. Second, {{there was no need to}} prove the existence of the insurance company (i.e., that its stock had actually been subscribed) <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a party. Nor was it necessary to prove that the policy would have been binding against the insurance company. Nor did it matter whether the policy would have paid out under the circumstances of the fraud. Finally, it was held that an insurance corporation was a person within the meaning of the statute.|$|E
5|$|Maroon: The university's {{official}} color {{used to be}} magenta, {{one which}} was shared by Harvard University. Since it was confusing for the two schools to be wearing the same color during athletic competitions, the matter of which school could lay claim to magenta was to be settled {{through a series of}} baseball games. Fordham won the games, but Harvard reneged on its promise. Both schools continued to use the color until 1874, when the Fordham student government unanimously agreed to change to maroon. Maroon was chosen <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> widely used at the time. Sometime later, Harvard stopped using magenta in favor of crimson.|$|E

5|$|OTA {{announced}} plans to include sound barriers at three points along the turnpike in April 1990. The locations were recommended by a report commissioned by OTA, using guidelines published by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). While another thirteen locations were likely to have similar noise levels as the three sites selected to receive barriers, abatement was not considered at those locations {{because they did not}} meet other criteria, including minimum population density. Although OTA was not required to follow FHWA guidelines on the Creek Turnpike <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a federally funded project, it opted to do so anyway.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the areas}} of focus on object {{permanence}} has been how physical disabilities (blindness, cerebral palsy and deafness) and intellectual disabilities (Down syndrome, etc.) affect the development of object permanence. In a study that was performed in 1975-76, {{the results showed that}} the only area where children with intellectual disabilities performed more weakly than children without disabilities was along the lines of social interaction. Other tasks, such as imitation and causality tasks, were performed more weakly by the children without disabilities. However, object permanence was still acquired similarly <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> related to social interaction.|$|E
5|$|Some Heathens {{practice}} {{forms of}} divination using runes; {{as part of}} this, items with runic markings on them might be pulled out of a bag or bundle, and read accordingly. In some cases, different runes are associated with different deities, one of the nine realms, or aspects of life. It is common for Heathens to utilize the Common Germanic Futhark as a runic alphabet, although some practitioners instead adopt the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc or the Younger Futhark. Some non-Heathens also use runes for divinatory purposes, with {{books on the subject}} being common in New Age bookstores. Some Heathens practice magic, although this is not regarded as an intrinsic part of Heathenry <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a common feature of pre-Christian rituals in Iron Age and Early Medieval Germanic Europe.|$|E

5|$|Southern {{business}} owners sought {{to reproduce the}} profitable arrangement of slavery with a system called peonage, in which disproportionately black workers were entrapped by loans and compelled to work indefinitely because of their debt. Peonage continued well through Reconstruction and ensnared {{a large proportion of}} black workers in the South. These workers remained destitute and persecuted, forced to work dangerous jobs and further confined legally by the racist Jim Crow laws that governed the South. Peonage differed from chattel slavery <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> strictly hereditary and did not allow the sale of people in exactly the same fashion. However, a person's debt—and by extension a person—could still be sold, and the system resembled antebellum slavery in many ways.|$|E
5|$|Thoughts {{of a new}} way {{to improve}} the {{nighttime}} environment began in summer 2011 when the new Cedar Fair CEO, Matt Ouimet was in the park one night and thought they should add more lights and excitement. The goal was to create a new show that would energize the main midway with bright lights and music. Matt Ouimet first mentioned the show at a conference in January 2012. Details of Luminosity were first announced at the PointBuzz winter tour of Cedar Point on February 25, 2012. The 3,600 square foot screen used for American Portrait and Hot Summer Lights was taken down on February 28 <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> needed for the new show. On April 13, Cedar Point officially announced Luminosity. The show debuted on June 1 for previews and its grand opening was held on June 8.|$|E
5|$|While Daniels {{supported}} the legislation, {{he believed the}} Republican lawmakers should drop the bill <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> part of their election platform and deserved a period of public debate. Republicans subsequently dropped the bill, but the Democratic lawmakers still refused {{to return to the}} capital, demanding additional bills be tabled, including a bill to create a statewide school voucher program. Their refusal to return left the Indiana General Assembly unable to pass any legislation, until three of the twelve bills they objected to were dropped from the agenda on March 28. The minority subsequently returned to the statehouse to resume their duties.|$|E
