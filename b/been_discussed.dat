5|$|Menominee Tribe v. United States is a {{landmark}} case in Native American law, {{primarily in the}} area of reserved tribal rights. It has been used in college courses to explain tribal sovereignty rights and that tribes retain some rights even if the tribe has been terminated, as the Menominee tribe was. The decision in the case has affected subsequent legislation, such as the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, in which Congress expressly extinguished all aboriginal rights. The case has <b>been</b> <b>discussed</b> internationally, for example in Australia regarding the relevance of indigenous or aboriginal title.|$|E
5|$|Most historians {{agree that}} Philip campaigned in Thrace in 353 BC, {{but what exactly}} he {{achieved}} {{is a matter of}} some confusion. As has <b>been</b> <b>discussed,</b> some, including Cawkwell and Sealey, place the Maroneia and Abdera campaign in 353 BC. Others suggest that, in a campaign whose details are essentially unknown, Philip defeated the central Thracian king, Amadokos, reducing him to the status of subject ally. Since the Maroneia and Abdera campaign took place in Amadokos's territory, it seems likely that, under either chronology, Philip campaigned against Amadokos in 353 BC.|$|E

5|$|The idea {{of group}} living has <b>been</b> <b>discussed</b> by many evolutionists for its costs and benefits. Alexander {{predicted}} that the cost to large groups {{is that they are}} more likely to suffer from parasitism, but at the same time, they benefit by defense against predation. This theory is not supported in the case of P.exclamans because the parasitism does not always increase with nest size and the predation rate was independent of size.|$|E
