5|$|A four-lane divided <b>bypass</b> of Urbana was {{constructed}} for MD 355 in the 2000s. The {{primary reason for}} constructing the <b>bypass</b> was to relieve traffic heading through the community {{brought on by the}} construction of numerous shopping centers in the area, and the costs for constructing the <b>bypass</b> were entirely paid for by the developers of an area shopping center. The proposal for the <b>bypass</b> called for two roundabouts to control traffic. The first portion of the road opened in late 2005 from MD 355 south to a roundabout at Sugarloaf Parkway. On October 30, 2008, construction began to build the connection of the <b>bypass</b> to MD 355 south of MD 80. The <b>bypass</b> was completed by January 2009, at which point MD355 was realigned onto it and the former alignment became MD355 Bus. In 2013, maintenance of the <b>bypass</b> of MD355 around Urbana was transferred from the developers to the state.|$|E
5|$|By 1997, {{the start}} of {{construction}} of the Hampstead <b>Bypass</b> was proposed {{for three to four}} years in the future; at that time, most of the engineering phase was complete but most of the highway right-of-way had yet to be purchased. The three-year timeframe was again put forth in 2001. Finally, in 2004, officials announced that the <b>bypass</b> would begin construction in autumn 2005. Construction finally got underway in summer 2006. Houcksville Road's bridge over the <b>bypass</b> and the highway's bridges over Shiloh Road and Indian Run were completed in 2007. The roundabouts at MD 482 and {{at the southern end of}} the <b>bypass</b> opened, without connections to the under-construction <b>bypass,</b> in April and May 2009, respectively. The roundabout at the northern end of the <b>bypass</b> opened when the <b>bypass</b> opened to traffic on August 6, 2009. To minimize disruption to the bog turtle habitat, MDSHA installed tunnels under the <b>bypass</b> for the turtles to use and employed goats to consume invasive species in the habitat area near the <b>bypass</b> rather than remove them with mechanical mowers. Old MD 30 through the center of Hampstead was redesignated MD 30 Business when the <b>bypass</b> opened.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, a {{southern}} <b>bypass</b> of Battle Creek opened along Columbia Avenue, {{and the former}} routing through downtown on Michigan Avenue became a Business US12 (Bus. US12). In late 1951 or early 1952, a northerly <b>bypass</b> of Jackson opened, and the former route through downtown on Michigan Avenue became another Bus. US12. By the next year, the western half of the Jackson <b>bypass</b> opened, including a <b>bypass</b> of Parma. In 1954, a new <b>bypass</b> of Kalamazoo and Galesburg opened; US12 was rerouted to follow the new highway while M-96 replaced {{part of the old}} route and the US12A in the area.|$|E
30|$|Other <b>bypassing</b> {{strategies}} are possible, including pre-register allocation <b>bypassing</b> [28], recursively <b>bypassing</b> chain of operations on critical path, <b>bypassing</b> after the block is fully scheduled without changing schedule to reduce only register file accesses, etc.|$|R

5|$|In 1956, several {{changes were}} made to US12's routing. A {{southern}} <b>bypass</b> of Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti was converted to a freeway. US12 was rerouted to follow the <b>bypass,</b> supplanting the M-17 and <b>Bypass</b> US112 designations used previously on the <b>bypass.</b> US112 was also rerouted, and it ran concurrently with US12 along the <b>bypass.</b> The former route of US12 along Plymouth Road from Ann Arbor east to Detroit was renumbered M-14, and the M-112 designation on the Willow Run and Detroit Industrial expressways was replaced by US12. At {{the same time as}} these {{changes were made}}, the Jackson <b>bypass</b> was upgraded to a full freeway. By the middle of 1958, the Kalamazoo <b>bypass</b> was converted to a full freeway.|$|E
5|$|In {{other parts}} of the state, other {{segments}} of highway were built to <b>bypass</b> the cities along the future I-94 corridor. In 1940, a southern <b>bypass</b> of Battle Creek opened along Columbia Avenue, and the former routing through downtown on Michigan Avenue became Business US12 (Bus. US12). In late 1951 or early 1952, a northerly <b>bypass</b> of Jackson opened, and the former route through downtown on Michigan Avenue became another Bus. US12. By the next year, the western half of the Jackson <b>bypass</b> opened, including a <b>bypass</b> of Parma.

5|$|Since {{as early}} as 1967, local {{officials}} have discussed building a Manchester <b>bypass,</b> either as a separate project {{or as part of}} a road bypassing both Hampstead and Manchester. However, by the mid-1970s, the town of Manchester decided it did not want the <b>bypass.</b> The <b>bypass</b> was planned to pass to the west of Manchester, but the town allowed a residential subdivision to be built along the <b>bypass</b> route. The planned <b>bypass</b> route was eventually changed to be east of town. After two decades of disagreement by the town and county over the path of the <b>bypass,</b> in 1993 the <b>bypass</b> was placed in the town's master plan. However, state support for the Manchester <b>bypass</b> was scrapped in 1998 by Smart Growth proponent and governor Parris Glendening, who said the <b>bypass</b> would promote suburban sprawl. The Manchester <b>Bypass</b> is neither in the Maryland Department of Transportation's Consolidated Transportation Program for 2012 to 2017 nor in MDSHA's 2011 Highway Needs Inventory for the next 20 years.|$|E

5|$|While {{plans to}} {{construct}} the <b>bypass</b> existed as late as 1985, the connection to the Queens Boulevard line at Northern Boulevard was built {{as an alternative to}} the <b>bypass.</b> A bellmouth was built at the end of the tunnel should construction on the <b>bypass</b> ever commence.|$|E
5|$|A Caversham <b>bypass</b> was {{constructed}} in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and was officially opened in 1987. It now carries State Highway 1 away from the retail heart of the suburb, connecting at its northern end with the city's one-way street system. With {{the construction of the}} <b>bypass,</b> Caversham Valley Road was truncated close to its junction with South Road, and the upper stretch of the road continued as part of State Highway 1, connecting the <b>bypass</b> with Dunedin Southern Motorway.|$|E
5|$|A MD 30 <b>bypass</b> of Hampstead {{has been}} {{contemplated}} since the 1940s and planned {{since at least}} 1960. The heavy traffic along the highway consisted of three types of highway users: local traffic made up {{of people who had}} moved to Hampstead or Manchester for the municipalities' small-town charm; regional traffic comprising people who had moved to Pennsylvania for cheaper housing and lower taxes but continued to work in the Baltimore area; and truck traffic serving local industry and making connections between Baltimore and Hanover. The increase in congestion on MD 30 accelerated with the completion of I-795 in 1987. By the early 1990s, it took as long as 15 minutes for motorists to pass through each of the towns during rush hour; an average of 20,000 to 25,000 motorists used the highway through Hampstead each day by 2001. Progress toward construction of the <b>bypass</b> was continually delayed. The <b>bypass</b> was removed from MDSHA plans by 1979. The Hampstead <b>Bypass</b> had returned to state plans by 1990, when engineering and design work was underway and construction was planned to begin in 1992. However, in 1991, the <b>bypass</b> was shelved for six years for lack of funding.|$|E

40|$|In {{translational}} <b>bypassing,</b> a peptidyl-tRNA::ribosome complex skips over {{a number}} of nucleotides in a messenger sequence and resumes protein chain elongation after a “landing site” downstream of the <b>bypassed</b> region. The present experiments demonstrate that the complex “scans” processively through the <b>bypassed</b> region. This conclusion rests on three observations. (i) When two potential “landing sites” are present, the protein sequence of the product shows that virtually all ribosomes land at the first and virtually none at the second. (ii) In such a sequence with two landing sites, the presence of a terminator triplet in phase in the coding region immediately after the first landing site drastically reduces the efficiency of <b>bypassing.</b> (iii) Internally complementary sequences that can form a stable stemloop in the <b>bypassed</b> region significantly reduce the efficiency of <b>bypassing.</b> We analyze <b>bypassing</b> from a given “takeoff” site to “landing sites” at different distances downstream so as to derive estimates of the frequency of ribosome takeoff and of the stability of the <b>bypassing</b> complex...|$|R

5|$|An {{engineering}} report {{dating back}} to 1961 suggested that building a <b>bypass</b> around the last two mainline tunnels {{was the best way}} to solve the congestion. The Commission awarded three contracts to construct the <b>bypass</b> from July 1966 to March 1967. The contracts cost $17.2 million for roadway and another $2.5 million for construction of a new Sideling Hill Service Plaza to replace the Cove Valley Service Plaza, which was along the to-be-bypassed alignment. The $2.5 million project was to include ramps from both directions to the service plaza, so it could serve both directions. The style of the tunnel <b>bypass</b> was to follow the same style as the Laurel Hill <b>bypass.</b> On November 26, 1968, the three twinned tunnels opened, and the <b>bypass</b> of the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill Tunnels opened. The new <b>bypass</b> also opened the Breezewood Interchange and the number of lanes along the turnpike expanded to four (two in each direction) or five (two in each direction, plus a climbing lane going uphill).|$|E
5|$|By 1945, Byp. US131, {{along with}} the other various <b>bypass</b> routes, was {{designated}} along the Grand Rapids beltline system, replacing M-114. Byp. US131 followed the south beltline (28th Street) and East Beltline Avenue between Division Avenue and Plainfield Avenue, allowing north–south traffic to <b>bypass</b> downtown Grand Rapids. In late 1949, M-37 was rerouted onto 28th Street between Kalamazoo and East Beltline/Broadmoor avenues. Then in 1953, US131 was rerouted onto the beltlines to replace its <b>bypass</b> route; the former mainline through downtown was redesignated Bus. US131.|$|E

40|$|Low power design {{promotes}} longer {{battery life}} in portable applications and reduces heat dissipation in high performance applications. Multiplication {{is one of}} the important operations in digital signal processing and their power dissipation is the prime concern. Many earlier multiplier designs were analyzed to reduce the switching transition. <b>Bypassing</b> technique is mainly used to reduce the switching power of the multiplier. Various <b>bypassing</b> multipliers such as Row <b>bypassing,</b> Column <b>bypassing,</b> Two-dimensional <b>bypassing</b> and Row-Column <b>bypassing</b> based multipliers were designed based on the simplification of the incremental adders and half adders instead of full adders in an array multiplier. In these multipliers extra correction circuits are required to obtain accurate results. The extra hardware in conventional design results in more power consumption. So, to overcome the drawback of conventional methods, the proposed low power <b>bypassing</b> based multiplier uses a simplified addition operation to reduce the switching activity and it achieves 38. 7 % and 25. 2 % of area and power reduction respectively. By taking the advantage of low power <b>bypassing</b> based multiplier, a digital FIR filter is implemented. The experimental results show that our proposed low power digital FIR filter saves 51 % and 7 % of area and power reduction respectively by using low power <b>bypassing</b> based multiplier...|$|R

5|$|Half a {{mile from}} the start of the <b>bypass</b> and a short {{distance}} before the arterial makes a turn eastward to traverse Canandaigua Lake to the southeast, US20 and NY5 meet NY21 at a four-way intersection. Like US20 and NY5, NY21 once continued directly into downtown, in this instance via Bristol Street to the east of the junction, but now follows US20 and NY5 along the east–west leg of the <b>bypass.</b> Past Bristol Street, the <b>bypass</b> widens from two to four lanes and, after meeting two local streets, enters the city of Canandaigua as the limited-access Western Boulevard, albeit with no exits. The route loses this distinction prior to intersecting South Main Street, where US20, NY5 and NY21 meet the southern terminus of NY332. NY21 departs the <b>bypass,</b> following NY332 into downtown, while US20 and NY5 continue onto the four-laned, median separated Eastern Boulevard, the original section of the US20 and NY5 <b>bypass</b> of Canandaigua.
