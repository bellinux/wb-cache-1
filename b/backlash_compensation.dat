40|$|In {{industrial}} applications, many {{tasks are}} repetitive. Iterative learning controllers are effective for tracking control in these repetitive tasks. This thesis addresses the tracking control problem of low-bandwidth systems with the Fourier series based iterative Learning Control scheme (FLC). With {{the existence of}} flexible parts and slow response, {{the performance of a}} low-bandwidth system is usually unsatisfactory. The main objective {{of this study is to}} develop the FLC for applications in low-bandwidth systems. In this thesis, the FLC is developed with three improvements: (i) <b>backlash</b> <b>compensation</b> in the time domain parallel to the FLC; (ii) phase-shifting compensation; and (iii) auto-tuning learning gains. <b>Backlash</b> <b>compensation</b> is carried out in the time domain to reduce backlash effects in tracking control. To improve the performance while maintaining the stability with the FLC, phase-shifting should be compensated in the learning process. An algorithm for phase-shifting calculation and compensation is proposed. For a nonlinear system, it is difficult to find learning gains to meet the convergence condition. The auto-tuning gain method is proposed in this thesis to solve the problem in choosing learning gains. Experimental results show the efficiency of the improved FLC in application for a low-bandwidth belt-driven system. To make full use of existing friction in mechanical systems, a newly designed asymmetrical trajectory is proposed. A method of using the FLC for system identification with eliminating quantization error in measurement is also proposed...|$|E

40|$|Virtual {{decomposition}} {{control is}} a new non-linear model-based (that is, based on the kinematics and dynamics of rigid bodies) control approach for controlling multiple degrees of freedom robots. It has been successfully applied to control several different hydraulic robots. On the other hand, hydraulic rotary actuators are types of actuator used when high power-to-size ratio and compact space utilization are required. They come in different types; the helical spline type often introduces backlash nonlinearity into control systems because of gear the transmission involved. Therefore, {{in order to achieve}} good reference tracking performance and guaranteed stability of systems in which they are applied, their backlash has to be somewhat accounted for by incorporating <b>backlash</b> <b>compensation</b> into their main controller structure. Thus, the essence of this research was to design a virtual decomposition controller with the capability to reduce or eliminate the effect of backlash in an application where helical type hydraulic rotary actuators is applied and compare the system performance with that obtained by applying the traditional Proportional- Integral- Differential controller. A general overview of robot control is presented, followed by the definition of basic terms related to virtual decomposition control. Thereafter, hydraulic rotary actuator is described, focusing on the helical gear type. Finally, backlash and its inverse are presented in graphical and mathematical forms to show their characteristics. A combination of the aforementioned concepts was used in {{the development and implementation of}} effective control approach for a manipulator actuated by a hydraulic rotary actuator. Based on recently proposed normalizing performance indicator μ, comparison of the three different controller algorithms presented were made. The results obtained indicated that the designed nonlinear model based controller, without and with <b>backlash</b> <b>compensation</b> significantly outperformed the classical Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller.

40|$|In {{automotive}} powertrains, backlash causes {{problems with}} vehicle driveability, specifically at so called tip-in and tip-out maneuvers. These maneuvers may trigger phenomena {{known in the}} automotive industry as shunt and shuffle, which are partially caused by the backlash. These phenomena are considered difficult to cope with, and until recently, only relatively simple controllers {{have been used to}} reduce the discomfort. Also, the tuning of these controllers is made quite subjectively. A number of approaches to the control of systems with backlash are reported in the literature. Most of these approaches assume another system structure around the backlash than what is the case in automotive powertrains. Very few approaches are therefore directly applicable to the control of automotive powertrains. The first part of this thesis gives an overview of available control strategies for backlash control. The strategies can be divided into active and passive strategies, depending on the way the controller handles the backlash. An active controller compensates the backlash nonlinearity by a more active control signal, while the passive controller becomes more cautious when the backlash gap is entered. Some of the strategies, e. g. switched linear controllers and model predictive controllers, are evaluated in the powertrain application by means of simulation. The results show that active nonlinear controllers have a potential for improved backlash control. However, the robustness of these controllers needs further investigation. Open-loop optimal control is used in this thesis as a way to find theoretical limits on <b>backlash</b> <b>compensation</b> performance. High-performance controllers for <b>backlash</b> <b>compensation</b> require high-quality measurements of {{the current state of the}} powertrain.

40|$|Abstract — Cable conduit {{actuation}} {{provides a}} simple yet dexterous mode of power transmission for remote actuation. However, {{they are not}} preferred because of the nonlinearities arising from friction and cable compliance which lead to backlash type of behavior. Unlike most of the current research in backlash control which generally assumes no knowledge {{of one of the}} intermediate states, the controller design in this case can be significantly simplified if output feedback of the system is available. This paper uses a simple feedforward control law for <b>backlash</b> <b>compensation.</b> A novel smooth backlash inverse is proposed, which takes the physical limitations of the actuator in consideration, unlike other designs, and thus makes it more intuitive to use. Implementation of this inverse on physical systems can also improve the system performance over the theoretical exact inverse, as well as other existing smooth inverse designs. Improvement in the performance is shown through experiments on a robot arm of Laprotek surgical system as well as on an experimental setup using polymeric cables for actuation. N I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Cardiac {{catheters}} allow {{physicians to}} access {{the inside of the}} heart and perform therapeutic interventions without stopping the heart or opening the chest. However, conventional manual and actuated cardiac catheters are currently unable to precisely track and manipulate the intracardiac tissue structures because of the fast tissue motion and potential for applying damaging forces. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing and implementing a robotic catheter system that use 3 D ultrasound image guidance and force control to enable constant contact with a moving target surface in order to perform interventional procedures, such as intracardiac tissue ablation. The robotic catheter system, consisting of a catheter module, ablation and force sensing end effector, drive system, and image-guidance and control system, was commanded to apply a constant force against a moving target using a position-modulated force control method.

40|$|When the Gemini Telescopes {{were built}} 20 years ago, the control {{architecture}} {{for the high}} precision requirements was {{the same for all}} systems. It consisted of VME cards, Programmable Multi Axis Con-trollers (PMAC) with speciﬁc ampliﬁers and a central computer. It was the state of the art. Nevertheless such an infrastructure takes up a lot of space. It is also diﬃcult to maintain mainly because of obsoles-cence and the lack of support of the engineers who do not consider this system adapted to the control. The code, documentation and wiring were complex and not fully understood. Thus, it led the Gemini Observatory to consider the acquisition of a new controller {{for one of the most}} critical unit: the Acquisition and Guidance (A&G). To address these issues, I propose an alternative control system which will not only solve the current issues but also improve the performance. The new generation of controller from Delta Tau is more eﬃcient, more reliable and with a high level of integration. The main concern of compatibility with the current motors and encoders of the Acquisition and Guidance has been solved by testing 27 motors out of the 29 present in the unit. Results were obtained using a test bench and mechanical systems built during the internship. A fully functional test bench has been delivered. Furthermore, a new control scheme for the <b>backlash</b> <b>compensation</b> is proposed. It consumes half the energy of the current one, is nearly two times faster and without oscillations.

40|$|Due to {{the demand}} for {{precision}} RF filter solutions, fully automated cavity filter manufacturing systems are a topic of interest for researchers. Currently, tuning stages for filter production lines are implemented by hand. This stringent process is both expensive and time consuming. Depending on {{the complexity of the}} cavity filter, this process may take up to several hours. Therefore, it is not suitable for higher volume production. To overcome this problem, Radio Frequency Systems (RFS Pty Ltd.) company is trying to develop a number of automated filter manufacturing systems that make the leap from conventional &lsquo;trial and error&rsquo; manual filter tuning to automatic robotic tuning and set a new standard for filter production. The aim of this project, supported by RFS, is to design and manufacture a Robotic Computer-Aided Tuning (RoboCAT) system. The first section of this thesis deals with the design and fabrication of an automated robot arm to interface with tuning elements. For this purpose, a customised coaxial screw/nut driver is created to tune and lock the tuning elements simultaneously. Aspects of the automated tuner include: (1) <b>Backlash</b> <b>compensation</b> to increase the tuning resolution and reduce the tuning time. (2) Absolute positioning {{in order to have a}} second feedback source for robot codes along with obtained data from Computer&ndash;Aided Tuning (CAT) software. (3) Fault recognition ability to detect any potential error in CAT codes in early stage. The second stage of this project deals with finding a proper tuning instruction. By having a complete tuning instruction, it is feasible to write a standalone tuning code for an automated tuning system. It can be concluded from literature that circuit model parameter extraction is the only ideal tuning technique to be implemented by automated setup. This technique allows all elements to be tuned simultaneously rather than sequentially. However, in order to tune the filter using this technique, adequate initial optimization variable values are required to prevent the system from running into local minimum or failing to converge to the proper solution. This case arises when the filter is highly detuned. To overcome this problem, a coarse tuning technique based on phase format of input reflection coefficient of the filter is proposed in this thesis. In this method, resonators are tuned by bringing successive resonators to resonance, while the phase passes through the &plusmn; 180 ˚ and 0 ˚ crossing at the center frequency. At the end of each sequence cross coupling is mapped across the entire range of its motion. Tuned cross coupling is recognized by measuring the return loss of the filter. Written codes based on this technique are able to guide the robot through coarse tuning process in a short time. Then, the circuit model parameter extraction technique is practically implemented by automated setup to complete the tuning. This proposed tuning system has been validated through experimental results. Results showed that utilizing the <b>backlash</b> <b>compensation</b> solution enables the robot to use accurate &lsquo; 1 &rsquo; arcminute rotational resolution to achieve less than &lsquo; 5 &rsquo; KHz frequency deviation in obtained filter response. This cannot be achieved with manual tuning. Elimination of mapping the tuning elements throughout the lash reduced the overall tuning time by 11 minutes and 23 seconds in an average of twenty tuning attempts. Absolute positioning system of the RoboCAT successfully detected the faulty tuning attempts caused by an error in CAT software. This enabled the robot to be function without supervision. Fabricated comprehensive coaxial/screw nut driver fitted with the designed SCARA, Cartesian, and multi-armed robots in order to tune the different filter types in the company without need for design updates. Several tuning attempts have been performed by the automated setup utilizing the proposed coarse tuning technique. Obtained filter response at the end of each tuning was very close to the ideal filter response. Therefore perfect initial values for the variables to be optimized were provided for the fine tuning program. This reduced the fine tuning time from 13 minute to less than 32 seconds and prevented the system from running into local minimum. Successful results in all tuning runs showed effectiveness of the tuning technique. Obtained tuning times via created setup was compared with traditional manual tuning attempts. RoboCAT achieved a tuned filter with an average time of 6 minutes compared to the manual tuning approach which took 42 minutes. These results obtained from 20 tuning attempt on a six-pole cross-coupled filter while the filter was tuned to channel 40 at a center frequency of 613. 5 MHz...|$|E
