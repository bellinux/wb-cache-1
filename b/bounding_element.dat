40|$|Generating smooth mixed block-unstructured meshes is a {{promising}} {{way to reduce}} mesh sizes for outer aerodynamic flow analysis. Beyond the core part of the mesh generation, the smooth meshing of the boundary layer region by structured hexahedrons and prisms, for the remaining flow field a triangulation method is needed that allows for a smooth transition between the different element types. In the past the author et al. reported new strategies to generate mixed meshes to significantly reduce mesh sizes without reduction of ac-curacy. The method relies on generating smooth structured hexahedral and prismatic elements for the resolution of boundary layers by a parabolic marching routine based on the face-weighted Laplace equation for a proper alignment and anisotropic stretching of cells resolving viscous flow regimes. Details of the method to generate structured hexahedral and prismatic mesh blocks are described there. One final brick of the mixed meshing method, an anisotropic triangulation method to generate <b>bounding</b> <b>element</b> conforming tetrahedral meshes has been reported by the author, where a special emphasis is put on a new sparse octree method for memory and time efficient propagation of the underlying propagation of the anisotropic metric information in the mesh domain.

Gamble; and Strength of slabs subjected to multiaxial bending and compression, by W. L. Gamble, H. Flug [and] M. A. Sozen. Summary of Flexural Strength Of Reinforced Concrete Slabs With Externally Applied In-Plane Forces by Girolaml, A. G. : Reinforced concrete slabs, bounded by elements which can develop horizontal reactions, have flexural capacities considerably {{in excess of}} the load calculated by an orthodox application of the yield-line analysis. The additional capacity results primarily from changes in geometry of the slab which generates in-plane forces reacting against the <b>bounding</b> <b>element.</b> Calculation of the effect of the in-plane forces on slab flexural strength is essential for a realistic evaluation of the slab capacity because the increase in load caused by the in-plane forces is not negligible, especially for short-time loading. The investigation described in this report was concerned with the development of a simple method of calculation for the flexural {{strength of}} reinforced concrete slabs with in-plane forces and to check the applicability of the method by experiments. Six reinforced concrete slabs with spandrel beams were built, instrumented, and tested. The test slabs, which were six-ft square and 1. 75 in. deep, were reinforced with intermediate grade steel (yield stress was approximately 48, 000 psl) and the concrete strength was approximately 4500 :psl [...] The slab and the spandrel beams had both negative and positive moment reinforcement to stimulate an interior panel in a two-way slab designed to carry 150 psf. Three of the test slabs were supported only at the corners while three were supported at several points along the spandrel beams to investigate the effects of nonyielding beams [...] . Summary of Strength Of Slabs Subjected To Multiaxial Bending And Compression by Gamble, W. L. : Reinforced concrete slab panels which are supported so that horizontal displacement of the edges of the panels are prevented are often capable of supporting considerably more load than would be indicated by simple yield-line analysis methods because of in-plane compression forces developed during deflection. The purpose of the series of tests and analysis described in this report was to demonstrate that the basic principles used in predicting the strength of reinforced concrete elements subjected to bending moments and thrusts in one direction, {{as in the case of}} columns, can also be used satisfactorily to predict the strength and behavior of slabs subjected to bending and in-plane forces acting in several directions at once. The importance of the in-plane forces can perhaps be best illustrated by reference to a set of tests conducted by Ockleston on a large reinforced concrete building. A single interior beam-supported panel carried a uniformly distributed load of 753 psf. While the computed capacity, using the yield-line analysis technique, was 295 psf. The very high load capacity is attributable to the presence of –in-plane compression forces generated when the surrounding panels restrained the lateral movements of the edges of the load panel. Six hexagonal reinforced concrete slabs were constructed and tested in order to investigate the effects of the reinforcement ratio and magnitude of in-plane forces on the strength and behavior of slabs. The slabs were reinforced with steel having a yield stress of about 50 kips/in. ² and the average concrete strength was about 6, 300 1 b/in. ² The slabs were four in. thick, and the basic hexagon measure about 6 ft 2 in. across flats. The edges of the hexagon were slotted to form loading wings, and the load was applied so as to produce constant bending moments in all directions within a three ft diam.
