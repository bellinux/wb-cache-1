25|$|The smoke {{detector}} has two ionization chambers, one {{open to the}} air, and a reference chamber which does not allow the entry of particles. The radioactive source emits alpha particles into both chambers, which ionizes some air molecules. There is a potential difference (voltage) between pairs of electrodes in the chambers; the electrical charge on the ions allows an electric current to flow. The currents in both chambers {{should be the same}} as they are equally affected by air pressure, temperature, and the ageing of the source. If any smoke particles enter the open chamber, some of the ions will attach to the particles and not be available to carry the current in that chamber. An electronic circuit detects that a current difference has developed between the open and sealed chambers, and sounds the alarm. The circuitry also monitors the battery used to supply or back up power, and sounds an intermittent warning when it nears exhaustion. A user-operated test button simulates an imbalance between the ionization chambers, and sounds the alarm if and only if power supply, electronics, and alarm device are functional. The current draw of an ionization {{smoke detector}} is low enough for a small battery used as sole or <b>backup</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> to be able to provide power for months or years without the need for external wiring.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A Data Centre (DC) is a {{facility}} used to house computer systems and their related components, such as storage and communications systems. It usually also includes <b>backup</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> environmental controls, data communications connections and security devices. Crucial aspects of most organizational operations {{around the world}} are IT operations. One of the main concerns is business stability; companies rely on their information systems to run their operations. Company operations may be impaired or stopped completely if a system becomes unavailable. A DC must therefore keep high standards for assuring the integrity and functionality of its hosted IT environment. The computer infrastructure in datacenter needs to be monitored for high availability. The software used for monitoring the DC must adhere the design principles such as reusability, modularity, maintainability etc. Several design patterns used in monitoring software cross cut rudimentary structures of classes. It is observed that many aspects are scattered across the functionalities of the monitoring software. This encouraged us to examine the impact of Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) on the software designs used in various software products in Data Centre. In this paper, impact of AOP on a few gang of four design patterns is analyzed along with an implementation case study of Singleton Pattern...|$|R
5000|$|High {{electric}} grid penetration by intermittent power sources (e.g. wind power) which have low capacity factors {{due to the}} weather, requires either: a) the construction of energy storage projects, which have their own emission intensity, or b) more frequent back up than the reserve requirements necessary to back up more dependable/baseload power sources, such as hydropower and nuclear energy. This higher dependence on back up/load following power plants to ensure a steady power grid output has the knock-on effect of more frequent inefficient (in e g/kWh) throttling up and down of these other power sources in the grid to facilitate the intermittent, or variably output, of these energy supplying systems.
