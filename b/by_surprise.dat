5|$|Some historians {{state that}} the German troops did not expect the Soviet {{armoured}} counterattack and were taken <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> on 12 July. However other historians have stated or argued that the German commanders were aware of, or at least anticipated, the Soviet armour that was massing around Prokhorovka, and therefore the troops {{could not have been}} genuinely surprised. The German historian Dieter Brand argues that even though the German commanders expected a major Soviet armoured deployment at Prokhorovka, the frontline German troops were indeed largely taken <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> when the Soviets counterattacked on the morning of 12 July.|$|E

5|$|After leaving Heraclea, Attalus and Sulpicius sacked both Oreus, on the {{northern}} coast of Euboea, and Opus, the chief city of eastern Locris. The spoils from Oreus had been reserved for Sulpicius, who returned there, while Attalus stayed to collect the spoils from Opus. However, with their forces divided, Philip, alerted by signal fire, attacked and took Opus. Attalus, caught <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> was barely able to escape to his ships.|$|E
5|$|After {{this the}} brigade {{continued}} to advance, moving through Ruddenburg and Greven before carrying out {{an attack on}} Osnabruck on 4 April 1945.

5|$|Although taken <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> Kesselring moved {{rapidly to}} regain control of the situation, {{summoning}} Generaloberst Eberhard von Mackensen's Fourteenth Army headquarters from northern Italy, the 29th and 90th Panzergrenadier Divisions from the Cassino front, and the 26th Panzer Division from Tenth Army. OKW chipped in some divisions from other theatres. By February, Kesselring was able to take the offensive at Anzio but his forces were unable to crush the Allied beachhead, for which Kesselring blamed himself, OKW and von Mackensen for avoidable errors.|$|E

5|$|Following the Wehrmacht's {{victory at}} Operation Market Garden, Hitler decided {{to launch a}} last-ditch {{offensive}} in the West aiming to catch the Anglosphere forces <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> {{with the objective of}} retaking Antwerp, striking the seam between the British and Americans that leads to political as well as military disharmony between the Allies, isolate the 21st Army Group, thereby allowing their encirclement and destruction before the American leadership (particularly the political leadership) could react and erasing the enemy ground threat to the Ruhr.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's {{first major}} {{achievement}} came in 1917 with the Champaran agitation in Bihar. The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against their largely British landlords who were {{backed by the}} local administration. The peasantry was forced to grow Indigo, a cash crop whose demand had been declining over two decades, and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad. Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, Gandhi took the administration <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> and won concessions from the authorities.|$|E

5|$|In May 1798, {{the arrest}} {{of a number of}} the leaders of the United Irishmen {{provoked}} the Irish Rebellion of 1798, a widespread uprising across Ireland. The Rebellion took the British authorities <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> but the introduction of regular British Army troops rapidly defeated the Irish armies and the last resistance was brought to an end in September with the surrender of a small French force at the Battle of Ballinamuck. The French authorities had also been taken <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> by the uprising, and were consequently unprepared: the forces they deployed were inadequate to face the much larger British armies operating in Ireland at the time. News of this defeat had still not reach the continent by October, when a second French invasion force set out. Closely watched by the Royal Navy as soon as it left Brest, the squadron was defeated on 12 October 1798 at the Battle of Tory Island: fewer than a third of the French ships returned to France.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of the help France gave to the Duke and Duchess in providing them with a home, and in lieu of death duties, the Duchess's collection of Louis XVI style furniture, some porcelain, and paintings were made over to the French state. The British royal family received no major bequests. Most of her estate went to the Pasteur Institute medical research foundation, on the instructions of Suzanne Blum. The decision took the royal family and the Duchess's friends <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> as she had shown little interest in charity during her life.|$|E

He ran a European leading time of 10.06seconds at Papaflessia in Greece, and won the 100m and 200m races at the 2009 European Team Championships. He was the fastest entrant at the national championships but 2008 runner-up Simeon Williamson won the final by some distance. The result took Chambers <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> {{and he said that}} limited opportunities to race had made him complacent. He later withdrew from the 200m race citing exhaustion.|$|E

5|$|Libya's prompt retreat {{took many}} {{observers}} <b>by</b> <b>surprise.</b> One reason lay in Gaddafi's desire {{to host the}} OAU's annual conference in 1982 and assume the organization's presidency. Another was Libya's difficult situation in Chad where, without some popular and international acceptance for Libyan presence, {{it would have been}} difficult to take the concrete risk of causing a war with Egypt and Sudan, with US support. Gaddafi had not renounced the goals he had set for Chad, but he had to find a new Chadian leader, as Goukouni had proved himself unreliable.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of June 25, 1950, ten {{divisions}} of the North Korean People's Army launched a full-scale invasion of the nation's neighbor to the south, the Republic of Korea. The force of 89,000men moved in six columns, catching the Republic of Korea Army <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> resulting in a rout.

40|$|Herein {{we explore}} whether {{macroeconomic}} announcements are a driving {{factor in the}} trading activity of US corporate bond market. Prior studies have documented a strong response of bond returns and interest rates to surprises in macroeconomic data in the US Treasury and Treasury futures markets. Likewise, studies have also documented that trading activity changes sharply, based on informational impulses provided by the release of economic data. We contribute to the existing literature by examining how both daily and intraday measures of trading activity are impacted <b>by</b> <b>surprises</b> in macro data. Our main findings are that the thinly-traded market for corporate bonds is largely unaffected <b>by</b> <b>surprises</b> in individual economic reports and {{that the market is}} dominated by day-of-week and time-of-day affects. The results stand in contrast to prior studies documenting increased financial market activity, such as Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold and Vega (2003). The existence of intraday or “diurnal” trading patterns is consistent with earlier findings in Anderson and Bollerslev (1997, 1998) studies with respect to intraday asset returns and volatility. Other authors citing the existence of diurnal trading patterns include, Engle and Ng (1993) and Engle and Solkasa (2012...|$|R

Out of a group of four widely-followed macroeconomic announcements, we find none of the announcements drive activity for investment grade bonds and that only surprises in the Producer Price Index contemporaneously affect speculative-grade bonds. We do however, find a large and significant decrease in activity on Monday and Friday. Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Ben Branch and Hossien Kazemi for helpful comments and suggestions.
