25|$|The {{doctrine}} of limited atonement is often argued from the theological argument of double jeopardy. In the limited view, Jesus Christ {{has taken the}} penalty of the elect - that Jesus died {{for those who would}} <b>believe,</b> <b>so</b> that those for whom Christ died must be saved and cannot be damned as it would be unjust for God to punish the same sins twice (double jeopardy). If Jesus died for all, they argue, then all must be saved. The penal theory of the atonement is therefore the basis of the necessity for a limited atonement.|$|E
25|$|From the {{privy council}} he {{obtained}} the necessary licence for travel. He gave {{out that he}} was going, the next vacation, to visit Sir Richard Sandys in Kent, and possibly to drink the Tunbridge waters. From the Kentish coast he took boat for Rotterdam, in a lay habit with 'scarlet cloake' and 'gold hat band'. In Holland he consorted with Roman Catholics as well as Protestants. On his return to Cambridge he met the rumour of his having been beyond the seas with a wonder 'at their silliness, that they would <b>believe</b> <b>so</b> unlikely a relation'. After all he had been outwitted, for Williams, the lord keeper, suspecting some puritan plot, had set a spy on his movements, who sent weekly intelligence of his doings.|$|E
25|$|Arriving at Cold Bay on 19 March 1945 {{and newly}} {{promoted}} to captain, Maxwell took {{command of the}} naval base there the following day. Under his command were 694 U.S. Navy and United States Coast Guard personnel, 47 United States Marines, and a U.S. Army contingent of 605; his personnel strength soon stabilized at around 1,500 as Army personnel transferred out and naval personnel replaced them. He found that an advance party under his second-in-command, U.S. Coast Guard Lieutenant Commander John J. Hutson, had already established Detachment 3294s Antisubmarine Warfare Department. He also discovered that the naval facilities required more rehabilitation {{than he had been}} led to <b>believe,</b> <b>so</b> he moved his command into Fort Randall, which had been closed since November 1944, and set about readying its facilities to support Project Hula, including the establishment of housing, classrooms, movie theaters, a radio station, and a softball field, the selection of instructors for courses in radio and radar operation, engineering, gunnery, minesweeping, damage control, and landing craft operation, and the procurement of radios, radars, minesweeping gear, gyrocompasses, engines, movie projectors, and training films and other educational tools.|$|E

500|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson (1948) {{states that}} Hel [...] "as a goddess" [...] in {{surviving}} sources seems {{to belong to}} a genre of literary personification, that the word hel is generally [...] "used simply to signify death or the grave," [...] and that the word often appears as the equivalent to the English 'death,' which Davidson states [...] "naturally lends itself to personification by poets." [...] Davidson explains that [...] "whether this personification has originally been based on a belief in a goddess of death called Hel is another question," [...] but that she does not believe that the surviving sources give any reason to <b>believe</b> <b>so.</b> Davidson adds that, on the other hand, various other examples of [...] "certain supernatural women" [...] connected with death {{are to be found in}} sources for Norse mythology, that they [...] "seem to have been closely connected with the world of death, and were pictured as welcoming dead warriors," [...] and that the depiction of Hel [...] "as a goddess" [...] in Gylfaginning [...] "might well owe something to these." ...|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "Fresh Blood" [...] was viewed by an estimated 2.88 million viewers. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. Tina Charles of TV Guide praised the episode, commenting that [...] "it {{was really nice}} to get an enjoyable episode high on intensity, brotherly interaction, blood and gore". Although she had grown a [...] "tad bit weary" [...] of the character's continuous attempts to kill Sam, she was still [...] "really sorry to see Sterling and Gordy go". Charles felt that his transformation was a [...] "good twist", and liked that his [...] "black-and-white beliefs" [...] remained the same even after becoming a vampire. She also enjoyed the character of Lucy and her [...] "really sad" [...] ending, and wished that McNab's role had been larger. It was noted that the [...] "brotherly interaction was front and center", and Charles was [...] "beyond happy" [...] that Sam confronted Dean about is behavior. The [...] "moment that [...] been waiting for all season long" [...] finally came to be when Dean took Sam seriously and actually listened to him instead of replying with sarcasm. Charles also deemed the final scene with the brothers to be [...] "just heartbreaking". Likewise, Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune not only gave the episode an A+, but ranked it as the sixth-best episode of the 2007-2008 television season. She praised writer Sera Gamble and director Kim Manners for [...] "creating the best bonding scene we've had all season", and lauded Padalecki and Ackles for [...] "making us care so much and <b>believe</b> <b>so</b> fully that a scene like this can leave us gasping".|$|E

500|$|... "All Around the World" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Jenna Rubenstein of MTV {{thought that the}} [...] "fist-pumping club banger" [...] is a complete departure from Bieber's previous work, while Diadem Pambid of the International Business Times stated that the singer joined the [...] "'synth-pop' bandwagon" [...] along with Britney Spears, Chris Brown and Usher. Jocelyn Vena also of MTV stated that the song could have been recorded by Usher, due to its [...] "grinding, fist-pumping" [...] background. Entertainment Weekly columnist Ray Rahman gave [...] "All Around the World" [...] a positive review, and stated: [...] "a Euro beat worthy of The Wanted? The vocal swagger of Chris Brown? Lyrics smacking of One Direction? Check, check, and check, please!" [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect rated [...] "All Around the World" [...] five out of five stars, and commented that the track {{is not only a}} sequel to [...] "Baby", but is also [...] "a whole new level for pop itself." [...] Becky Bain of Idolator explained that the song {{is a good example of}} how Bieber is taking [...] "baby steps to 'swaggy' adulthood through the evolution of his music — keep the content G-Rated, but make the beat something the older club-going crowd can enjoy. So far, it’s working." [...] Amy Sciaretto of Pop Crush gave the track a mixed review, and deemed it as highly similar to the work of Spears, stating: [...] "If you told us this song was penned for Britney Spears for her last album Femme Fatale, we'd Believe it, because the computerized style and the thick vocal effects remind us of recent Brit material. It's safe to say that 'All Around the World' is a club banger. And while we love Bieber, it's not our favorite song on <b>Believe</b> <b>so</b> far." ...|$|E
500|$|Homer and Marge are {{scheduled}} to do a singing toast at their cousin Valerie's wedding, causing Marge to become nervous, due to her fear of embarrassment. Homer tells her not to worry, saying that he will {{make sure they do}} not mess up. Homer gets a fortune cookie stating that today will be his lucky day, but he does not <b>believe</b> <b>so.</b> However, he starts to believe this occurs when he crashes into a vending machine causing all of the snacks to fall out on him, and finds an Emerson, Lake & Palmer CD in the parking lot. He sings along to [...] "Lucky Man", driving recklessly to the synthesizer solo. He then goes to the Kwik-E-Mart for a lottery ticket, even though he has to go to the wedding and sing with Marge. After a long wait, Homer gets his lottery ticket, only to find out the wedding has ended. When he takes his eyes off the road for a second, he crashes off the ramp. Homer wakes up in the hospital after the crash, and realizes he won a million dollars in the lottery. Homer does not want Marge to know he missed the wedding to get a lottery ticket, and has Barney pose as the winner. So that Marge does not know he won the money, he secretly leaves gifts for his family members. However, when Homer tries to get money out of the tree where he hid the money, Bart discovers that he won the lottery. Threatening to tell Marge, Bart demands that Homer publicly embarrasses himself, does unethical tasks, and becomes a victim of his own son. Eventually, Homer decides to tell Marge himself and get it over with. Taking Marge on a hot-air balloon, he reveals he won the lottery, causing Marge to become very glad and not furious about his absence at the wedding; he tells her he spent it all, leaving them poor as usual. However, Marge does not care, saying at least they have each other. Homer then reveals he spent the last of the money on a giant cherry blossom grove in the shape of Marge's face with the words [...] "Love of my Life". They then sing the song they were supposed to sing at the wedding together, off in the sunset.|$|E
500|$|Mercedes {{featured}} {{in three of}} the episode's musical numbers. Flandez said of her solo, [...] "She blew Jennifer Hudson's 'Spotlight' out of this world." [...] Benigno wrote that it was [...] "great", but added that it was [...] "not much of a stretch for Amber Riley to hit this one". Berk praised her [...] "amazing voice" [...] and gave the performance four stars out of five, and Goldberg characterized the rendition as [...] "flawless". Other reviewers were more critical, including VanDerWerff, who said that this was the only song in the episode that [...] "really didn't work". Slezak felt that the arrangement used was not distinct enough from the original, though he gave the performance a [...] "B+", as did West, who wrote, [...] "Mercedes looked fantastic and carried herself well, and her voice was as strong as ever but it felt a little lacking." [...] In her [...] "Maria-off" [...] with Rachel, Benigno said they [...] "both kill it", characterized it as [...] "easy but fun", and gave it an [...] "A−", as did Slezak and West, the latter of whom [...] "didn't feel that Mercedes was the clear winner" [...] but thought both singers were [...] "fantastic". Kubicek thought that [...] "Mercedes clearly won" [...] and Flandez maintained that she [...] "clearly outshone her rival", and continued, [...] "You just <b>believe</b> <b>so</b> much of what she sings." [...] Berk agreed, and contrasted the two singers with his rating scale of one to five stars: [...] "Two stars for Rachel, who sang this like Barry Manilow; four for Mercedes, who sang this like she lived it." [...] Futterman had a slightly different take: [...] "Rachel puts on a diva front, but inside she's scared and nervous, while Mercedes is just a diva." [...] However, Hyman thought that the two [...] "were evenly matched", while Canning and Billboard Rae Votta both thought Rachel was the victor; Votta stated, [...] "While the show wants us to believe otherwise, Rachel clearly outsang Mercedes". [...] "It's All Over" [...] from Dreamgirls received the most enthusiastic commentary, including an [...] "A+" [...] from West, who wrote [...] "Mercedes was at her best in this performance", a sentiment echoed by Benigno when he awarded the song an [...] "A". Hyman called it [...] "pretty awesome" [...] and Flandez a [...] "cleverly amusing take", while Futterman said Mercedes [...] "fully embraces her inner Effie White" [...] and that the song was [...] "on par with the best of Glee's Broadway songs in terms of plot relevancy and vocal arrangements". She also praised [...] "the first group showtune the New Directions have done" [...] and added, [...] "we want more". Votta characterized it as [...] "a flawless fantasy homage" [...] and stated, [...] "It's the perfect use of the non-realism of [...] "Glee" [...] and the power of musical theater to express a storyline". Kubicek agreed it was [...] "like a real musical" [...] in these regards and praised Mike's short solo, and West liked the segment where Santana confronts Mercedes in the number. Slezak was not enthusiastic about the rendition, and wrote that he wished that the [...] "scene gelled better than it did", and questioned why Mercedes was the character Effie while all the other members of New Directions were themselves. He gave the number a [...] "C+".|$|E

In contrast, Mal is, at the movie's beginning, a man who has lost all faith.

2500|$|When {{questioned}} on Midweek Politics {{about whether}} reporting on celebrities' sexual orientation incites homophobia {{by making it}} news, Hilton indicated {{that he did not}} <b>believe</b> <b>so.</b> He said that coming out in Hollywood is not necessarily a bad thing, citing Ellen DeGeneres and Rosie O'Donnell as examples: [...] "I know there is some controversy about outing people, but I also believe the only way we're gonna have change is with visibility. And if I have to drag some people screaming out of the closet, then I will. I think that lots of celebrities have an archaic fear that being gay will hurt their career but look at Rosie. Look at Ellen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lines 1-10 {{represent}} the preserved {{core of the}} poem. [...] Lines 11-13 are denoted as [...] "Catullus 2b" [...] and differ significantly in tone and subject from the first 10 lines. [...] Hence, these latter three lines may belong to a different poem, although most scholars do not <b>believe</b> <b>so.</b> [...] Rather, the prevailing hypothesis {{is that the two}} sets of lines (1-10 and 11-13) are fragments of a whole, and that lines bridging the transition between them have been lost. [...] In the original manuscripts, this poem was combined with Catullus 3, which describes the death of Lesbia's sparrow, but the two poems were separated by scholars in the 16th century.|$|E

Brown was instrumental in putting together most of the songs on Muma Gee's debut full-length. In 2006, the album, entitled Kade was released as a CD to music stores. Muma Gee had explained the meaning of its title in an interview, [...] "it is a courageous word that gives hope. I <b>believe</b> <b>so</b> much in empowerment. So Kade represents advocacy and empowerment towards nation building [...] For example, in my language, we say Kade, meaning go, but its typical meaning is keep moving on and you will get there someday." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hazlitt {{discovered}} {{the truth about}} Tomkins, {{and from then on}} his jealousy and suspicions of Sarah Walker's real character afforded him little rest. For months, during the preparations for the divorce and as he tried to earn a living, he alternated between rage and despair, on the one hand, and the comforting if unrealistic thought that she was really [...] "a good girl" [...] and would accept him at last. The divorce was finalised on 17 July 1822, and Hazlitt returned to London to see his beloved—only to find her cold and resistant. They then become involved in angry altercations of jealousy and recrimination. And it was over, though Hazlitt could not for some time persuade himself to <b>believe</b> <b>so.</b> His mind nearly snapped. At his emotional nadir, he contemplated suicide.|$|E
