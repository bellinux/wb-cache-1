5000|$|On July 9, 2008, nearly 12 {{years after}} their daughter's death and two years after Patsy's death, John Ramsey and his late wife were officially cleared in the death by the Boulder District Attorney's office based on new DNA {{evidence}} collected from JonBenét's clothing; this particular type of DNA analysis did not exist {{at the time of}} the killing. Boulder County District Attorney Mary Lacy said new DNA tests point to an [...] "unexplained third party" [...] as possibly responsible for the killing. Modern [...] "touch DNA" [...] suggests that a male of Hispanic origin (per updates on DNA and DNA found under JonBenét's fingernails two weeks after the murder which Hunter had access to) left traces on two separate clothing articles: the undergarment panties and leggings. This was done against normal practice and police still believe them to not be cleared of all charges. (Mark Beckner, retired <b>Boulder</b> Chief of <b>Police,</b> has claimed that Mary Lacy had always strongly believed that a mother could not possibly be responsible for the death of her daughter in that fashion so sought to exonerate Ramsey, and that the [...] "trace DNA" [...] found on JonBenét's underwear by the Colorado Bureau of Investigation was in such minute quantities nanograms that it could have come from the clothing's [...] "manufacturing process." ...|$|R
2500|$|Burke, who {{was nine}} {{years old at the time}} of JonBenét's death, was interviewed by {{investigators}} at least three times. The first two interviews did not raise any concerns about Burke. A review by a child psychologist stated that it appeared that the Ramseys had [...] "healthy, caring family relationships". In 1998, <b>Boulder</b> <b>Police</b> Chief Mark Beckner said during an interview with a news reporter that Burke Ramsey was not involved in the killing of his sister. In May 1999, the Boulder County District Attorney's office reiterated that Burke Ramsey was not a suspect. The investigators had never considered him a suspect.|$|E
2500|$|John and Patsy Ramsey were sued in two {{defamation}} lawsuits {{arising from}} the publication of their book, The Death of Innocence. These suits were brought by two persons named in the book who {{were said to have}} been investigated as suspects by <b>Boulder</b> <b>police.</b> The Ramseys were defended in those lawsuits by Lin Wood and three other Atlanta attorneys, James C. Rawls, Eric P. Schroeder, and S. Derek Bauer. They obtained the dismissal of both lawsuits, including an in-depth decision by U.S. District Court Judge Julie Carnes that [...] "abundant evidence" [...] in the murder case pointed to an intruder having committed the crime.|$|E
2500|$|Mary Lacy, {{the next}} Boulder County District Attorney, {{took over the}} {{investigation}} from the police on December 26, 2002. In April 2003, she agreed with a federal judge who sat on a 2002 libel lawsuit case that evidence in the suit is [...] "more consistent with a theory that an intruder murdered JonBenet than {{it was with a}} theory that Mrs. Ramsey did". On February 2, 2009, <b>Boulder</b> <b>police</b> Chief Mark Beckner announced that Stan Garnett, the new Boulder County District Attorney, was turning the case over to his agency and that his team would resume investigating it.

2500|$|The {{second group}} of {{theories}} is that a family member was involved in her death. <b>Boulder</b> <b>police</b> initially concentrated almost exclusively upon John and Patsy Ramsey. According to Gregg McCrary, a retired profiler with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, [...] "statistically, it is a 12-to-1 probability that it's {{a family member or}} a care giver" [...] who is involved in the death of a child. From the police's perspective, they did not see evidence of a forced entry, saw evidence of staging, such as the ransom note, and did not find the Ramseys cooperative in helping them solve the death of their daughter. The Ramseys had stated that their reluctance was due to their fear that there would not be a full investigation for intruders and that they would be hastily selected as the key suspects in the case, according to Daily Camera.|$|E
2500|$|JonBenét Patricia Ramsey ( [...] ; August 6, 1990 – December 25 or 26, 1996) was an American child {{beauty pageant}} queen {{who was killed}} in her family's home in Boulder, Colorado, on the night of December 25–26, 1996, at the age of six. A lengthy ransom note was found in the house, and her father, John Ramsey, found JonBenét's body in the {{basement}} of their house about eight hours after she was reported missing. She sustained a broken skull from a blow to the head and had been strangled; a garrote was found tied around her neck. The autopsy report stated that the official cause of death was [...] "asphyxia by strangulation associated with craniocerebral trauma". Her death was classified as a homicide. The case generated nationwide public and media interest, in part because her mother Patsy Ramsey (herself a former beauty queen) had entered JonBenét in a series of child beauty pageants. The case still remains an open investigation with the <b>Boulder</b> <b>Police</b> Department.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{the police}} and the DA {{particularly}} said in 1998 that JonBenét's brother Burke, who was 9 {{years old at the time}} of her death, was not a suspect. [...] The Ramseys gave several televised interviews, but resisted police questioning except on their own terms. In October 2013, unsealed court documents revealed that a 1999 grand jury had recommended filing charges against John and Patsy for permitting the child to be in a threatening situation and hindering the prosecution of an unidentified person who had [...] "committed ... the crime of murder in the first degree and child abuse resulting in death". However, the DA determined there was insufficient evidence and did not pursue an indictment. In 2002, the DA's successor took over investigation of the case from {{the police and}} primarily pursued alternative theories of a non-family intruder committing the killing. In 2003, a trace DNA taken from the victim's clothes was found to belong to an unknown male, inducing the DA in 2008 to send the Ramseys a letter of apology declaring the family [...] "completely cleared".

They presented 437 items of evidence, and concluded that the evidence pointed away from the Ramseys. However, they were unable to successfully challenge the police department's steadfast belief that the Ramseys were guilty. The District Attorney's office sought {{to take control of the}} investigation. Due to the animosity between the police department and the DA's office and the pressure to obtain a conviction, Roy Romer, the governor of Colorado, interceded and named Michael Kane as special prosecutor to initiate a grand jury. Two of the lead investigators in the case who had opposing views, Lou Smit and Steve Thomas, resigned. Smit, who had worked for the DA's office, resigned because he believed that the investigation had incompetently overlooked the intruder hypothesis. Thomas, a police detective who later wrote a book about the case, initially cited health concerns when resigning, but later said he had done so because the DA's office had interfered with and failed to support the police investigation of the case.|$|E

40|$|JonBenet Patricia Ramsey was a six {{year old}} rising {{star in the}} beauty pageant world when she was found brutally murdered in the {{basement}} of her home in Boulder, Colorado on December 26, 1996. Nineteen years later, the crime remains unsolved and no convictions have ever been made in the case.

Also, they did not accept help from more experienced agencies, such as the Denver Police Department, available nearby. This paper reviews and analyzes the procedural mistakes made by the <b>Boulder</b> <b>Police</b> Department in Boulder, Colorado throughout the course of the kidnapping and subsequent murder investigation. These mistakes are specified and interpreted as to how the department should have handled the investigation in order to protect and preserve the crime scene evidence that was eventually damaged due to carelessness. Next, the theory of the main suspects, John and Patsy Ramsey, as well as a possible intruder are discussed while addressing the physical and circumstantial evidence gathered during the case and how the mistakes of the police investigation might have hindered a conviction.

[...] Monday 2 ̆ 7 s {{scheduled}} {{interviews with}} John and Patsy Ramsey {{could provide the}} jumpstart that the stalled investigation of their daughter Jon-Benet 2 ̆ 7 s brutal murder needs, says UGA trial and criminal law expert Ron Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 These interviews are a positive sign, 2 ̆ 2 said Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 They signal {{to the public that}} the case remains under active investigation. Second, they bring the Ramseys together with the people responsible for solving this crime - the <b>Boulder</b> <b>police.</b> Such cooperation is virtually always helpful to law enforcement. Finally, while participation in these interviews may not conclusively establish the innocence of the Ramseys, the willingness of John and Patsy to sit for interrogation - which they are not required to do - does impress many people as conduct which is inconsistent with guilt. 2 ̆ 2 Carlson has previously criticized some Colorado police and prosecutors for their refusal to discuss certain aspects of the case, saying that the Ramseys had been 2 ̆ 2 so pilloried, so horribly tried in the media, that in fairness, some of the exonerating evidence should be disclosed. 2 ̆ 2 For example, he cites last fall 2 ̆ 7 s disclosures published by Newsweek magazine: 2 ̆ 2 Newsweek reported that DNA from tissue found under Jon-Benet 2 ̆ 7 s fingernails has not been matched to anyone in the family, 2 ̆ 2 said Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 Particularly when citizens have been subjected to trial by tabloid, careful and measured release of some of the investigative information which is helpful to the individual is in the public interest. 2 ̆ 2 The Monday interviews in Atlanta will be the first major sit-down by the Ramseys with the <b>Boulder</b> <b>police</b> in two years. It has been reported that a substantial delegation of authorities will arrive in Atlanta and that the <b>Boulder</b> <b>police</b> chief apparently has new questions and information - prospects Carlson views as encouraging. 2 ̆ 2 The interview potentially promises to be a pivotal step, 2 ̆ 2 he said. Carlson, a nationally recognized expert in evidence, trial practice and criminal procedure, has litigated many cases and has argued twice before the United States Supreme Court. He has written numerous books on trial techniques and provided extensive commentary for the national media in high-profile trials.
