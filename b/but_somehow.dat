5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder {{encounters}} a delusional man, Gary Lambert (Brian Markinson), who believes his boss, Greg Pincus (John Apicella), may be a monster—and decides to take an entire office building, including Mulder, hostage to prove it. Lambert is eventually killed, <b>but</b> <b>somehow,</b> Mulder inherits his ability to see Pincus as a monster. After Mulder claims that Pincus is a monster, he is locked in a psychiatric hospital, only to be saved by Scully: {{the only person who}} believes him.|$|E
5|$|The {{money was}} used to {{complete}} the line to Nantwich, and to build a reservoir at Bunbury Heath. The work was completed in August 1779, and the company hoped to raise enough money to then build the line to Middlewich. They proposed building it with narrow locks, to reduce the cost, but the shareholders were not prepared to support them; instead they concentrated on trying to generate traffic on the line that had been built. They attempted to mine salt at Nantwich, but failed to find any, and tried running boats on the Trent and Mersey, from which goods were carried over land to Nantwich, for onward carriage to Liverpool. They also ran boats for cargo and passengers on the canal itself. By the end of 1781, the company had no money {{and was unable to}} meet interest payments on the loans. They decided to forfeit the canal to Egerton, the main mortgagee, but he did not respond to their offer. Angry landowners who had not been paid drained Bunbury reservoir in March 1782, <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> the committee managed to keep the canal open, by selling boats and land. Disaster struck in November 1787, when Beeston Staircase Locks collapsed, and there was no money to fund repairs.|$|E
25|$|The Gunlords of Omega Ceti {{try to kill}} Skizz by {{travelling}} back in time <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> end up in 22nd century Australia {{where they}} met Dredd.|$|E
60|$|FITZSIMMONS. <b>But</b> it's <b>somehow</b> {{different}} now when you've got your girl's clothes on.|$|R
60|$|Five showy girls--but Thirty is an age When girls may be ENGAGING, <b>but</b> they <b>somehow</b> don't ENGAGE.|$|R
6000|$|... "This was {{all very}} triumphant: <b>but</b> yet, <b>somehow,</b> the {{prospect}} of the French conquest did not add to Mr. Museau's satisfaction.|$|R
25|$|The crowd booed, barracked and slow-clapped but the Australians {{refused to}} try for a result. It was disappointing <b>but,</b> <b>somehow,</b> inevitable. Winning or losing the Ashes was even then such a huge event that no captain wanted to take {{unnecessary}} risks.|$|E
25|$|After being {{supplied}} with oil southeast of Madagascar by KKpt Oesten's U-861, which was short of fuel herself, U-510 {{ran out of}} fuel in the North Atlantic, <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> managed to reach base at Saint-Nazaire, in France, on 23 April after 103 days at sea.|$|E
25|$|One day for {{the march}} I {{received}} this heavy old gun. A gun? And during a war? Never, I thought to myself. And leaned it against a hut. And walked away. But that stood out even in our group at that time. I don't know now how I got away with it, <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> it worked. And so I got by unarmed.|$|E
60|$|Gambouge, being a Frenchman, did not {{understand}} the quotation, <b>but</b> felt <b>somehow</b> strangely and singularly interested in the conversation of his new friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, old thing, I don't know if I {{have got}} your meaning exactly, <b>but</b> you <b>somehow</b> {{give me the}} {{impression}} that you don't like that jolly old work of Art." ...|$|R
50|$|If {{delinquency}} rates decreased as immigrants {{moved through}} different ecological environments, then delinquency {{could not be}} associated with the particular constitution of the immigrants, <b>but</b> must <b>somehow</b> be connected with their environment.|$|R
25|$|What {{at first}} held his {{attention}} now {{made him want}} to flee. It was maddening to be inside– to be swallowed whole– so long. He had an image of himself, stuffed, behind glass, <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> still alive, crouching over a fake campfire, feeding meat to a lifeless child. Museum silence became a source of torment, a kind of noise; he needed birdsong, breezes, trees.|$|E
25|$|The filín movement, which {{originally}} {{had a place}} every afternoon on Radio Mil Diez, survived {{the first few years}} of the revolution quite well, <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> did not suit the new circumstances and gradually withered, leaving its roots in jazz, romantic song and the bolero perfectly healthy. Some of its most prominent singers, such as Pablo Milanés, took up the banner of the nueva trova.|$|E
25|$|Binsey {{stands on}} the {{otherwise}} low-level watershed separating the catchments of the Ellen {{to the north and}} the Derwent to the south. A slight ridge connects it to Great Cockup in the main massif of the Northern Fells, two miles to the south east. Binsey itself has a rounded form, <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> manages to impress the eye more than the similar Great Mell Fell and Little Mell Fell.|$|E
5000|$|Mary Remmy Njoku as Vanilla, {{a cynical}} {{young woman who}} claims she doesn't [...] "do love," [...] <b>but</b> has <b>somehow</b> managed {{to fall in love}} with Kunle, the man she is dating.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh dear, she isn't of {{the lower}} class," [...] Mrs. Dangerfield {{returned}} with an irritated sense of wasted wisdom. She liked to explain her country, <b>but</b> that <b>somehow</b> always required two persons.|$|R
60|$|The head is motionless, <b>but</b> {{it expresses}} <b>somehow</b> that she does.|$|R
25|$|He {{returned}} to Germany in January 1933, and published Bevor Hitler kam: Urkundlich aus der Frühzeit der Nationalsozialistischen Bewegung (Before Hitler Came: Documents from the Early Days of the National Socialist Movement), {{dealing with the}} Thule Society and the DAP. Hitler himself understandably disliked this book, which was banned. Sebottendorf was arrested, <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> escaped (presumably due to some friendship from his Munich days) and in 1934 {{returned to}} Turkey.|$|E
25|$|Nine months later, Aditya's company {{announces the}} name of a new caller card as Geet on {{television}} which Geet's family sees. When Geet's uncle (Pavan Malhotra) angrily meets Aditya he says Geet is not with him <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> knows that she is fine but actually he does not know Geet's condition as he thought Geet would be with Anshuman. He goes to meet Anshuman and discovers that Anshuman had rejected Geet.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} interpretations for this disparity: either the {{universe}} began with a small preference for matter (total baryonic number of the universe different from zero), or the universe was originally perfectly symmetric, <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> a set of phenomena contributed to a small imbalance in favour of matter over time. The second {{point of view is}} preferred, although there is no clear experimental evidence indicating either of them to be the correct one.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{know it is}} not an embellishing dress, and she {{did look}} gaunt and haggard; <b>but</b> still <b>somehow</b> we liked her better than ever before; and she is so very good and charitable.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Troy: [...] "Till now, I still can't {{forget what}} it was like after disbanding. You {{suddenly}} lose your focus in life. <b>But,</b> this <b>somehow</b> made me grow up and gave my life perspective".|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank you, father dear," [...] she rejoined {{with the}} same natural, even tone of voice which should have tranquillised him as to her mental condition, <b>but</b> which <b>somehow</b> failed to do so.|$|R
25|$|In 2000, Jay-Z {{released}} , {{which was}} {{originally intended to}} become a compilation album for Roc-A-Fella artists <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> turned into a Jay-Z album. The album helped to introduce newcomer producers The Neptunes, Just Blaze, Kanye West, and Bink, which have all gone on to achieve notable success. This is also the first album where Jay-Z utilizes a more soulful sound than his previous albums. The Dynasty sold over two million units in the U.S. alone.|$|E
25|$|The Time Lords {{become the}} masters of time travel when one of their number, the {{scientist}} Omega, creates an {{energy source to power}} their experiments in time. To this end, Omega uses a stellar manipulation device, the Hand of Omega, to rework a nearby star into a new form to serve as that source. Unfortunately, the star flares into a supernova, then collapses into a black hole. Omega is thought killed in the explosion, <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> survives in an antimatter universe beyond the black hole's singularity.|$|E
25|$|<b>But</b> <b>somehow,</b> a small {{misunderstanding}} arose between Mahatma Gandhi and Sree Narayana Guru, {{regarding the}} modus operandi of the Satyagraha. One of Guru's dialogues with the General Secretary of the SNDP was misinterpreted {{in such a}} way that it led to believe that the ideals of Gandhiji and Guru clashed. There was a stage when someone suggested to Gandhiji to withdraw the support for the Satyagraha because the spiritual leader of the Thiyyas was urging his followers to use violence, which is against the principles of Satyagraha.|$|E

60|$|The dog {{looked up}} and raising a paw scraped at her hand, until she opened it, when he thrust his chin into her palm. It was a trivial incident, <b>but</b> it <b>somehow</b> stirred the man.|$|R
60|$|KEITH. The thing can't stand. I'll stop it <b>somehow.</b> <b>But</b> {{you must}} give me time, Larry.|$|R
25|$|The 1940s {{brought forward}} a new {{generation}} of musicians—Aníbal Troilo, Osvaldo Pugliese, Miguel Caló, Alfredo de Ángelis, Ricardo Tanturi, Ángel D'Agostino, etc.—and a new characteristic style. Fresedo sought to adapt to these new times, <b>but</b> <b>somehow,</b> this attempt merely detracted from the strength of the fresediano style that had so successfully combined so as successful rhythm and elegance. From this time forward, his orchestrations become slower and he chooses mellifluous singers who even, in some cases, give a certain boleristic air to their versions of his tangos.|$|E
25|$|Hancock's {{men began}} {{assembling}} near the Brown farm that evening, about 1200 yards {{north of the}} Mule Shoe, in a torrential rainstorm. The men and junior officers were poorly prepared for the assault, lacking basic information {{about the nature of}} the ground to be covered, the obstacles to expect, or how the Confederate line was configured. Confederates could hear their preparations through the storm, but could not decide whether an attack was imminent or the Union Army was preparing to withdraw. Allegheny Johnson became suspicious and requested to Ewell that his artillery be returned. Ewell agreed, <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> the order did not reach the artillery units until 3:30a.m. on May 12, 30 minutes before Hancock's assault was planned to start.|$|E
25|$|They {{were also}} {{critical}} of the races on water weather forecasting, which during the three days of storm, did not alter its forecast for a following SE wind change, which never eventuated. But probably lured yachts further south and away from Tasmania than necessary before tacking due west to close the coast. Sea-U-Later along with other yachts tracked down the 151-degree east longitude, becoming becalmed for 20 hours around 42 degrees south, in {{the centre of the}} weakened low, that all weather reports had said had moved well into the Tasman Sea. Whilst a respite the delay cost them dearly, Sea-U-Later was 37th to complete the race. The official explanation of the meteorology during the period was in the same edition, <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> this was not communicated to yachts at sea at the time.|$|E
50|$|In 1979, Dost {{was among}} those, led by Juhayman al-Otaybi, who were {{involved}} in the Grand Mosque seizure in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. He was arrested after the Saudi government stormed the Mosque, <b>but</b> was <b>somehow</b> freed and fled to Peshawar, Pakistan.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you call}} {{yourself}} a good Christian," [...] said Foy reproachfully. [...] "Now I have heard that your head {{was going to be}} chopped off with this sword, <b>but</b> that <b>somehow</b> you managed to steal it first and got away." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>But</b> beware lest <b>somehow</b> this {{liberty of}} yours become a {{stumbling}} block {{to those who}} are weak.|$|R
