Injection and combustion phases were analysed by digital imaging. Mixing process, autoignition and pollutants formation were investigated by broadband ultraviolet–visible extinction spectroscopy and flame emission measurements. Moreover, fuel distribution and oxidation were studied as well. Liquid fuel and vapour phase, injected around the top dead centre, were analysed. The liquid diesel fuel was observed by extinction measurements when the liquid jet reached the <b>bowl</b> <b>rim</b> and aromatic compounds due to fuel decomposition were identified.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis deals with measuring in-cylinder combustion species and events using different laser-based diagnostic methods. A variety of engine operating modes, like HCCI and partially premixed diesel combustion, have been investigated. In the very first measurements, in-cylinder flow-fields were compared to CFD and steady-state blow rig results. After that, the ignition and combustion process of HCCI was investigated using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) of formaldehyde and hydroxyl. In the low-temperature reactions that precede the main combustion, formaldehyde (HCOH) was seen to form homogeneously over the viewed area. Hydroxyl, OH, is formed in the high temperature regions that mark the main combustion; {{it was determined that}} OH is formed in areas from which formaldehyde had disappeared. By using different start of injection timings, different degrees of homogeneity could be obtained for HCCI combustion and the effects of this were examined using the above mentioned laser-technique. The engine-out NOx level was monitored to see what in-homogeneity level could be tolerated before getting too much NOx. Going from early injections towards late, a distinct change in the homogeneity was seen with injection at 70 CAD and around 50 CAD NOx levels started to increase. Later, LIF measurements were performed on combustion modes other than HCCI, these studies also included the use of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). The modes that were examined and compared with port and DI HCCI were UNIBUS combustion using two fuel injection events and low-temperature diesel combustion with one injection 8 crank angles before top dead centre. The feasibility of using formaldehyde, or other partially-oxidized fuel elements, as a naturally occurring fuel tracer were investigated by comparing the distribution of those species with that of the common fuel tracer toluene. The distributions of the two species are similar to each other in HCCI meaning that formaldehyde could be a tracer candidate. In low-temperature diesel, it seems like a good tracer; however more research is needed on the impact of polyaromatic hydrocarbons. In the last part, high-dilution low-temperature diesel combustion was studied and during this time the first planar flow measurements in a firing diesel engine were obtained. Furthermore, LIF measurements of partially-oxidized fuel and LII of soot were performed. The initial distribution of partially-oxidized fuel was found to correlate well with regions of heat release that were identified from the flow field divergence. In the later stages of combustion, soot and partially-oxidized fuel were found to be concentrated in the cylinder centre and no bulk flow exist, at least not for our piston design, that transport this fluid to regions where oxidation could take place. Partially-oxidized fuel was also found in the squish region which can be a source of emissions of CO and unburned fuel. It was also seen that single-cycle measurements show good similarity to the mean results. In the very last study that is presented, the flow structures of two low-temperature diesel operating conditions are compared at two swirl ratios. Differences are seen in the reverse-squish flow {{as well as in the}} fluid motion near the <b>bowl</b> <b>rim.</b> The main influence of decreasing the swirl was that the fluid motion at the <b>bowl</b> <b>rim</b> was altered...|$|E

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of the project, Tailored Materials for High Efficiency Compression Ignition Direct Injection (CIDI) Engines, is to enable the {{implementation}} of new combustion strategies, such as homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI), that {{have the potential to}} significantly increase the energy efficiency of current diesel engines and decrease fuel consumption and environmental emissions. These strategies, however, are increasing the demands on conventional engine materials, either from increases in peak cylinder pressure (PCP) or from increases in the temperature of operation. The specific objective of this project is to investigate the application of a new material processing technology, friction stir processing (FSP), to improve the thermal and mechanical properties of engine components. The concept is to modify the surfaces of conventional, low-cost engine materials. The project focused primarily on FSP in aluminum materials that are compositional analogs to the typical piston and head alloys seen in small- to mid-sized CIDI engines. Investigations have been primarily of two types over the duration of this project: (1) FSP of a cast hypoeutectic Al-Si-Mg (A 356 / 357) alloy with no introduction of any new components, and (2) FSP of Al-Cu-Ni alloys (Alloy 339) by physically stirring-in various quantities of carbon nanotubes/nanofibers or carbon fibers. Experimental work to date on aluminum systems has shown significant increases in fatigue lifetime and stress-level performance in aluminum-silicon alloys using friction processing alone, but work to demonstrate the addition of carbon nanotubes and fibers into aluminum substrates has shown mixed results due primarily to the difficulty in achieving porosity-free, homogeneous distributions of the particulate. A limited effort to understand the effects of FSP on steel materials was also undertaken {{during the course of this}} project. Processed regions were created in high-strength, low-alloyed steels up to 0. 5 in. deep that showed significant grain refinement and homogeneous microstructures favorable to increased fracture toughness and fatigue performance. The final tasks of the project demonstrated that the FSP concept can be applied to a relevant part geometry by fabricating diesel piston crowns with FSP regions applied selectively to the edge of the <b>bowl</b> <b>rim.</b> This area of the piston typically suffers from conditions at high PCP that cause severe thermal fatigue issues.

40|$|Surrogate organisms {{have been}} used to study highly {{pathogenic}} organisms, or organisms that cannot be cultured in the laboratory. Surrogates are selected based on multiple similarities to the pathogen, such as morphology, genome size and structure, and environmental characteristics. This dissertation utilized MS 2 coliphage as a surrogate for norovirus and Ebola virus in three environments. MS 2 is an icosahedral, single-stranded RNA bacteriophage. It is a male-specific coliphage that infects the bacteria Escherichia coli. Its properties, such as morphology and survival in the environment, have been likened to those of many enteric viruses. Because of this, it {{has been used as a}} surrogate for pathogenic enteric viruses for disinfection testing on surfaces, in water and in food; modeling the movement and survival of pathogens in different environments; and transfer properties from surfaces. This dissertation utilized MS 2 as a surrogate in three different studies. In the first, MS 2 is used as a surrogate for human enteric viruses in irrigation canals to predict the re-suspension of pathogenic viruses from bed sediment into overlying irrigation water using a flume to re-create field conditions in the laboratory. MS 2 re-suspension into the overlying water was characterized at varying flow rates and velocities using two sediment types. Its overall re-suspension was not statistically significantly different (p > 0. 05) between flow rates. The additional studies in this dissertation used MS 2 as a surrogate for Ebola virus in human waste. Ebola virus is a BSL- 4 organism that is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids. It is found in bodily fluids in concentrations between 10 ^ 5. 5 and 10 ⁸ genome copies per milliliter. In the first study using MS 2 as a surrogate for Ebola virus, efficacies of four disinfectants were tested using 10 ¹² PFU of MS 2 in one liter containing 2. 25 % (w/v) organic matter at three contact times (1, 15 and 30 minutes). The purpose of this study was to assess the disinfectants on reducing virus in waste before toilet flushing. Peracetic acid and quaternary ammonium formulation were found to reduce the concentration of MS 2 in the toilet bowl the fastest (within one minute) with the greatest reduction (2. 26 and 1. 99 log₁₀), when compared with the other disinfectants. Reductions observed from hydrogen peroxide were significantly less than those from peracetic acid and quaternary ammonium (p < 0. 05). The contamination of restroom surfaces by MS 2 was also evaluated after toilet flushing with and without disinfectant treatment. All four disinfectants were found to significantly reduce the viral concentrations on fomites after 15 minutes of contact (p < 0. 05). Despite disinfectant use, three sites were contaminated in 100 % of trials (N = 18). These were the toilet <b>bowl</b> <b>rim,</b> the toilet seat top and underside. The final study evaluated the inactivation of MS 2 and several other viruses by thermophilic and mesophilic anaerobic digestion. Little information is available on the influence of the wastewater treatment process, specifically anaerobic digestion, on emerging viruses, such as Ebola virus. It is important to evaluate this process due to the environmental disposal and discharge of wastewater and solids into the environment. All viruses were recoverable after mesophilic digestion (reductions from 1. 8 - 6. 6 log₁₀ per mL), except the lipid-containing bacteriophage Φ 6. Thermophilic digestion inactivated all viruses significantly (p = 0. 0011) more than mesophilic digestion. The reductions by thermophilic digestion ranged from 2. 8 - 7. 1 log₁₀ per mL. The inactivation between the initial concentration and both digestion types was statistically significant (p = 0. 007) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{reported in}} this thesis {{is concerned with the}} topic of soot formation and soot particle motion in the cylinder of a light duty automotive diesel engine. CFD has been employed to simulate in-cylinder conditions and to investigate the source of particles which are transferred to the oil. The accumulation of soot in the lubricating oil of diesel engines is one of the factors limiting the interval between oil changes and hence service interval. Soot particles can be transferred to oil film on the cylinder wall layers through the complex motion of the fluid flow in the cylinder. The paths of soot particles from specific in-cylinder locations and crank angle instants have been explored using the results for cylinder charge motion predicted by the Kiva- 3 v CFD code. Using the velocity fields from the simulation data, massless tracking of the in-cylinder soot particles in space and time is carried out employing a particle tracking with trilinear interpolation technique. From this investigation, new computational codes for the prediction of soot particle paths and soot particle size change along a specific path in a diesel engine have been developed. This investigation is the first numerical study into soot particle trajectories within an engine and thus opens up a novel branch of research of soot formation within internal combustion engines. Computed soot paths from the investigation show that soot particles formed just below the fuel spray axis inside the middle bowl area during early injection period are more likely sources of soot particles on the cylinder wall layers than those formed later. Soot particles that are formed above the fuel axis have less tendency to be transported to the cylinder wall layers thus {{are not likely to be}} the main source of soot at the cylinder walls. Soot particles that are from the <b>bowl</b> <b>rim</b> area are found to be another source of soot transfer to the boundary layer, as they are directly exposed to reverse squish motion during the expansion stroke. Soot particles that are formed near the cylinder jet axis during fuel injection tend to move into the bowl. These soot particles are found to be from the relatively less concentrated area. In contrast, particles from the most concentrated areas tend to be moving into the bowl and pose least risk of contaminating oil films on the liner. Sensitivity studies of soot particle paths to swirl show that engine operating with low swirl ratios are more vulnerable to soot in oil problem as low swirls cause the bulk fluid flow to be moving closer to the cylinder walls due to fuel jet velocity and reverse squish motions. Decreasing the spray angle lessens the possibilities of soot particles from being transported close the cylinder wall layers while increasing the spray angle increases the possibilities of soot from the bowl region to be transported close to the cylinder wall layers. The temporal and spatial evolution of soot particle size can be predicted by using the history of temperature, pressure and gas species along the paths. An explorative investigation has been carried out to determine the most suitable method to tackle this soot particle evolution. With proper multipliers, all approaches perform quite satisfactorily in terms of predicting the trend of size change. Soot particles that are likely to be transferred to the cylinder wall layers are predicted to change in size parallel to the average mass profile in the whole cylinder where they quickly peak to maximum at around 18 ° CA ATDC, and gradually decrease in size through EVO...|$|E
