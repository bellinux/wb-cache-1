5|$|An error as to a jurisdictional, or precedent, fact is an {{exception}} to the general rule that the High Court does not judicially review errors of fact. Under the threefold classification of the broad grounds of judicial review set out in Council of Civil Service Unions v.

5|$|Biofuels have {{a limited}} ability to replace fossil fuels and should not <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> ‘silver bullet’ to deal with {{transport}} emissions. However, they offer the prospect of increased market competition and oil price moderation. A healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes and reduce dependency on fossil fuels, especially in the transport sector. Using transportation fuels more efficiently is also {{an integral part of}} a sustainable transport strategy.|$|E
5|$|A {{cluster is}} a group of loosely coupled {{computers}} that work together closely, so that in some respects they can <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> single computer. Clusters are composed of multiple standalone machines connected by a network. While machines in a cluster {{do not have to be}} symmetric, load balancing is more difficult if they are not. The most common type of cluster is the Beowulf cluster, which is a cluster implemented on multiple identical commercial off-the-shelf computers connected with a TCP/IP Ethernet local area network. Beowulf technology was originally developed by Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker. The vast majority of the TOP500 supercomputers are clusters.|$|E

5|$|Anxious-ambivalent {{attachment}} is also misnamed as 'resistant attachment'. In general, a {{child with}} an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the mother departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when she returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy {{is a response to}} unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant) or helplessness (ambivalent passive) towards the caregiver on reunion can <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.|$|E
5|$|Biofuels have {{a limited}} ability to replace fossil fuels and should not <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> ‘silver bullet’ to deal with {{transport}} emissions. Biofuels on their own cannot deliver a sustainable transport system and so must be developed {{as part of an}} integrated approach, which promotes other renewable energy options and energy efficiency, as well as reducing the overall energy demand and need for transport. Consideration needs to be given to the development of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, public transport, and better town and rural planning.|$|E
5|$|Concentrator {{photovoltaics}} (CPV) systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for {{the purpose}} of electrical power production. Contrary to conventional photovoltaic systems, it uses lenses and curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto small, but highly efficient, multi-junction solar cells. Solar concentrators of all varieties may be used, and these are often mounted on a solar tracker {{in order to keep the}} focal point upon the cell as the sun moves across the sky. Luminescent solar concentrators (when combined with a PV-solar cell) can also <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> CPV system. Concentrated photovoltaics are useful as they can improve efficiency of PV-solar panels drastically.|$|E

5|$|During the 1930s Vaughan Williams came to <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> leading {{figure in}} British music, {{particularly}} after {{the deaths of}} Elgar, Delius and Holst in 1934. Holst's death was a severe personal and professional blow to Vaughan Williams; the two had been each other's closest friends and musical advisers since their college days. After Holst's death Vaughan Williams was glad of the advice and support of other friends including Boult and the composer Gerald Finzi, but his relationship with Holst was irreplaceable.|$|E
5|$|In April 1883 Carvalho finally revived Carmen at the Opéra-Comique, with Adèle Isaac {{featuring}} in an under-rehearsed {{production that}} removed {{some of the}} controversial aspects of the original. Carvalho was roundly condemned by the critics for offering a travesty of what had come to <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> masterpiece of French opera; nevertheless, this version was acclaimed by the public and played to full houses. In October Carvalho yielded to pressure and revised the production; he brought back Galli-Marié, and restored the score and libretto to their 1875 forms.|$|E
5|$|In middle age, Walton left Britain {{and set up}} {{home with}} his young wife Susana on the Italian island of Ischia. By this time, he had ceased to <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> modernist, {{and some of his}} {{compositions}} of the 1950s were criticised as old-fashioned. His only full-length opera, Troilus and Cressida, was among the works to be so labelled and has made little impact in opera houses. In his last years, his works came back into critical fashion; his later compositions, dismissed by critics {{at the time of their}} premieres, were revalued and regarded alongside his earlier works.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} these steps toward equal treatment, a legal flaw remained: if {{children}} were born within a lesbian marriage, the non-biological mother was not legally regarded as a parent; she still had to undergo the lengthy financial process of adoption. This right was granted to heterosexual couples (married or not), where a stepfather could declare his wife's children to be his without further process. On 7 November 2006, the Spanish Parliament amended the law on assisted reproduction, allowing the non-biological mother to <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> parent alongside her female spouse who is the birth-mother.|$|E
5|$|Junkin played {{four years}} of college {{football}} at Duke University. In the 1987 NFL Draft, the Cleveland Browns traded up to select him with the fifth overall pick. He played in parts of two seasons for the Browns, both of which ended early due to injury. Junkin was then traded to the Kansas City Chiefs for a fifth-round selection and played in five more games. After his release from the Chiefs, he did not play another game in the NFL. His failure to establish himself in the NFL has caused him to <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> draft bust.|$|E

In 984, in obedience to a vision of St Andrew, he persuaded King Æthelred to appoint Ælfheah as Bishop of Winchester in succession to Æthelwold. In 986, Dunstan induced the king, by a donation of 100 pounds of silver, to stop his persecution of the See of Rochester.|$|E

5|$|The 1832 {{exhibition}} of Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm, a painting containing apparently gratuitous nude figures, met a hostile reception from critics. From then on, while Etty continued to paint nude {{figures for the}} rest of his career, he made a conscious effort to try to illustrate moral lessons with his work. This effort was not wholly successful, and he continued to <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pornographer by some throughout his career.

5|$|The 19th-century {{historian}} Theodor Mommsen compiled {{and described}} in detail the various elements {{that at one time}} or another have been asserted as elements within the ritualistic execution of a parricide during the Roman Era. The following paragraph is based on that description, it is not to <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> static ritual that always was observed, but as a descriptive enumeration of elements gleaned from several sources written over a period of several centuries. Mommsen, for example, notes that the monkey hardly can have been an ancient element in the execution ritual.|$|E
5|$|The Muslim {{conquest of}} the city {{solidified}} the Arab control over Palestine, control which would not again be threatened until the First Crusade in the late 11th century. Thus, it came to <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> holy site by Islam, {{as well as by}} Christianity and Judaism. This stabilized control of Palestina Prima. In 613, the Jewish revolt against the Byzantine Heraclius culminated with the conquest of Jerusalem in 614 by Persian and Jewish forces and establishment of Jewish autonomy. The revolt ended with the departure of the Persians and also ended 15years of Jewish autonomy.|$|E
