25|$|Many {{people with}} {{narcolepsy}} also suffer from insomnia {{for extended periods}} of time. The excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy often become severe enough to cause serious problems in a person's social, personal, and professional life. Normally, when an individual is awake, <b>brain</b> <b>waves</b> show a regular rhythm. When a person first falls asleep, the <b>brain</b> <b>waves</b> become slower and less regular, which is called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. After {{about an hour and}} a half of NREM sleep, the <b>brain</b> <b>waves</b> begin to show a more active pattern again, called REM sleep (rapid eye movement sleep), when most remembered dreaming occurs. Associated with the EEG-observed waves during REM sleep, muscle atonia is present called REM atonia.|$|E

40|$|The {{non-linear}} resonance {{hypothesis of}} music perception was tested {{in an experiment}} comparing a group of musically sophisticated {{and a group of}} less sophisticated subjects. The prediction that weakly chaotic music entrains less complex <b>brain</b> <b>wave</b> (EEG) oscillations at the prefrontal cortex was confirmed by using a correlational dimension algorithm. Strongly chaotic (stochastic) and periodic music both stimulated higher <b>brain</b> <b>wave</b> complexity. More sophisticated subjects who prefer classical music showed higher EEG dimensions while less sophisticated subjects responded with a drop in <b>brain</b> <b>wave</b> complexity to rhythmical weakly chaotic music.

25|$|VEP {{testing of}} acuity is {{somewhat}} similar to preferential looking in using {{a series of}} black and white stripes (sine wave gratings) or checkerboard patterns (which produce larger responses than stripes). Behavioral responses are not required and <b>brain</b> <b>waves</b> created by the presentation of the patterns are recorded instead. The patterns become finer and finer until the evoked brain wave just disappears, which is considered to be the endpoint measure of visual acuity. In adults and older, verbal children capable of paying attention and following instructions, the endpoint provided by the VEP corresponds very well to the psychophysical measure in the standard measurement (i.e. the perceptual endpoint determined by asking the subject when they can no longer see the pattern). There is an assumption that this correspondence also applies to much younger children and infants, though this does not necessarily have to be the case. Studies do show the evoked <b>brain</b> <b>waves,</b> as well as derived acuities, are very adult-like by one year of age.|$|E

25|$|The REM {{phase is}} also known as {{paradoxical}} sleep (PS) and sometimes desynchronized sleep because of physiological similarities to waking states, including rapid, low-voltage desynchronized <b>brain</b> <b>waves.</b> Electrical and chemical activity regulating this phase seems to originate in the brain stem and is characterized most notably by an abundance of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, combined with a nearly complete absence of monoamine neurotransmitters histamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine.|$|E

25|$|In the ultradian sleep cycle an {{organism}} alternates between deep sleep (slow, large, synchronized <b>brain</b> <b>waves)</b> and paradoxical sleep (faster, desynchronized waves). Sleep {{happens in the}} context of the larger circadian rhythm, which influences sleepiness and physiological factors based on timekeepers within the body. Sleep can be distributed throughout the day or clustered during one part of the rhythm: in nocturnal animals, during the day, and in diurnal animals, at night. The organism returns to homeostatic regulation almost immediately after REM sleep ends.|$|E

25|$|Next, the {{significance}} of this newly identified relay system was evaluated by placing lesions in the medial and lateral portions of the front of the midbrain. Cats with mesancephalic interruptions to the ARAS entered into a deep sleep and displayed corresponding <b>brain</b> <b>waves.</b> In alternative fashion, cats with similarly placed interruptions to ascending auditory and somatic pathways exhibited normal sleeping and wakefulness, and could be awakened with somatic stimuli. Because these external stimuli would be blocked by the interruptions, this indicated that the ascending transmission must travel through the newly discovered ARAS.|$|E
25|$|Janov {{initiated}} {{from the}} outset small-scale research using questionnaires and measures of EEG, body temperature, blood pressure and pulse from his patients. A 1971 Pittsburgh Press article cited a University of California at Irvine study on primal therapy patients that showed a slowing of <b>brain</b> <b>waves.</b> Janov claimed that primal therapy reduced, in some patients, the frequency and the amplitude of Alpha waves, core body temperature (as much as three degrees) and blood pressure (as much as 30 percent). Two Brain Research Institute (UCLA) scientists confirmed that there were brain-wave changes in primal patients.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to fast direct synaptic interactions between neurons forming a network, oscillatory activity is modulated by neurotransmitters {{on a much}} slower time scale. That is, the concentration levels of certain neurotransmitters are known to regulate the amount of oscillatory activity. For instance, GABA concentration {{has been shown to}} be positively correlated with frequency of oscillations in induced stimuli. A number of nuclei in the brainstem have diffuse projections throughout the brain influencing concentration levels of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, acetylcholine and serotonin. These neurotransmitter systems affect the physiological state, e.g., wakefulness or arousal, and have a pronounced effect on amplitude of different <b>brain</b> <b>waves,</b> such as alpha activity.|$|E

25|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} {{experiments on}} animals {{can be set}} up differently than those on humans. The “flower pot” method involves placing a laboratory animal above water on a platform so small that it falls off upon losing muscle tone. The naturally rude awakening which results may elicit changes in the organism which necessarily exceed the simple absence of a sleep phase. This method also stops working after about 3 days as the subjects (typically rats) lose their will to avoid the water. Another method involves computer monitoring of <b>brain</b> <b>waves,</b> complete with automatic mechanized shaking of the cage when the test animal drifts into REM sleep.|$|E
25|$|The main {{function}} of the ARAS is to modify and potentiate thalamic and cortical function such that electroencephalogram (EEG) desynchronization ensues. There are distinct differences in the brain’s electrical activity during periods of wakefulness and sleep: Low voltage fast burst <b>brain</b> <b>waves</b> (EEG desynchronization) are associated with wakefulness and REM sleep (which are electrophysiologically similar); high voltage slow waves are found during non-REM sleep. Generally speaking, when thalamic relay neurons are in burst mode the EEG is synchronized {{and when they are}} in tonic mode it is desynchronized. Stimulation of the ARAS produces EEG desynchronization by suppressing slow cortical waves (0.3–1Hz), delta waves (1–4Hz), and spindle wave oscillations (11–14Hz) and by promoting gamma band (20 – 40Hz) oscillations.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis is {{relatively}} easy when all the symptoms of narcolepsy are present, but if the sleep attacks are isolated and cataplexy is mild or absent, diagnosis is more difficult. It is also possible for cataplexy to occur in isolation. Three tests that are commonly used in diagnosing narcolepsy are the polysomnogram, the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), and administration of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. These tests are usually performed by a sleep specialist. The polysomnogram involves continuous recording of sleep <b>brain</b> <b>waves</b> {{and a number of}} nerve and muscle functions during night time sleep. When tested, people with narcolepsy fall asleep rapidly, enter REM sleep early, and may often awaken during the night. The polysomnogram also helps to detect other possible sleep disorders that could cause daytime sleepiness.|$|E
