6000|$|... "Oh, Sam Rover!" [...] exclaimed the girl. [...] "And Will Jackson! Whatever <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> <b>here?</b> Where is Songbird--do {{you know}} {{anything}} about him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Make an end {{of these}} fine speeches, madam. I <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> to tell me if the child will grow up pretty and fortunate.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Little Ghita!" [...] exclaimed Vito Viti, [...] "as I hope {{one day to}} lie in {{the bosom}} of Father Abraham! Bellissima Ghita, what has <b>brought</b> <b>thee</b> <b>here,</b> and in such evil company?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Depart in peace, in God's name,' {{returned}} the Mask in a melancholy tone, 'and keep our secret, remembering {{that those who}} <b>brought</b> <b>thee</b> <b>here</b> were crushed and stricken women, and that those who bade thee go free could have had thy life with one word, and no man the wiser.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want to {{know what}} <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> out <b>here,</b> Dike Powell?" [...] he heard Mr. Arbuckle say in excited tones. [...] "Did you follow me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{give up the}} Tower--just yet. That is what--he has <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> for. He {{wants you}} {{to give it up}} and go back. Don't!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{is in the}} house, Marie; that is why I have <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> <b>here.</b> These {{good people}} have nursed and {{concealed}} him for five months." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It may be--it may be," [...] agreed Rinkitink, sadly. [...] "It {{is one of}} my {{greatest}} failings. But what chance <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> <b>here,</b> my Lord Pinkerbloo?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> down <b>here</b> for one thing. If you wire it up I'll {{have you}} {{sent back to}} your own time continuum. If you don't--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss March, I do {{not wish}} you to suppose that I <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> up <b>here</b> {{for the purpose of}} viewing those rolling hills and distant forests." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Father Agustin <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> in <b>here</b> {{several hours}} ago," [...] she explained; [...] "but {{that was before}} I arrived. I was worried, but the doctor says we needn't be alarmed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The payment, you mean. It {{can hardly}} serve {{us now to}} go into matters such as that. What is it that has <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> <b>here,</b> Lefroy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|When the {{servants}} had retired, 'In {{the name of}} God, Waverley, what has <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> <b>here?</b> It may {{be as much as}} your life is worth.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What I <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> for,' said Louis, 'was {{to ask you}} to let me do what I {{have long}} wished--to let me put the letter M here?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Dunwoodie! how happy, on many accounts, I am to see <b>you!</b> I have <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> in <b>here,</b> {{to prepare}} <b>you</b> {{to meet an}} {{unexpected}} friend in the opposite room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{want you}} to find another slave girl, Dick," [...] she said earnestly, [...] "not even if it <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> down <b>here</b> again. I should not like that at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{all over}} with us, my lad," [...] the captain said to Roger, who was {{standing}} quietly beside him. [...] "God forgive me, I have <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> all <b>here</b> to die." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, it is Master Lirriper!" [...] {{one of them}} said. [...] "Why, {{what has}} <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> <b>here?</b> I {{did not know that}} your trips often {{extended}} to London." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know it. They say {{the death}} is easy. I <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> <b>here.</b> Forgive me that. I should {{have tried to}} row you ashore as you said." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have said}} you were honoured for your conduct, Nick, and paid for it. Now, {{let me know what}} has <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> to-night, and whence you come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Miss Walters, I don't think I {{ought to}} have <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> out <b>here,</b> and I am quite sure I ought not to stay any longer. Do return. Your Aunt will be annoyed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But after all," [...] he said, [...] "it wasn't to {{talk about}} Heneage that I <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> down <b>here.</b> What I want to know, Colonel, is {{if you can help}} me at all with Louise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not here, to the arroyo," [...] {{and half}} leading, half {{dragging}} him, {{made her way}} through a copse of manzanita and alder until they heard the faint tinkling of water. [...] "Dost thou remember," [...] said the girl, [...] "it was here," [...] pointing to an embayed pool in the dark current, [...] "that I baptized thee, when Father Pedro first <b>brought</b> <b>thee</b> <b>here,</b> when we both played at being monks? They were dear old days, for Father Pedro would trust no one with thee but me, and always kept us near him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is none, Inkoosi. They <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> <b>here,</b> {{they told}} me how the evil brute of a buffalo had nearly killed you in the pool; that is all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is this?" [...] cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. [...] "What is the matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> <b>here?</b> What is it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't it!" [...] he replied. [...] "Well, I {{will tell}} you the real reason of my having <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> and of my having made this confession. I <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> because I could not bear to go on living, if not under your roof, at any rate in the neighbourhood, without telling you the truth. Now you know it. I am here to watch Mr. Fentolin. I am going on {{watching}} him. You can put him on his guard, if you like; I shan't complain. Or you can--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you were}} in my place," [...] {{answered}} the Sergeant, [...] "you would have formed an opinion--and, as things are now, any doubt you might previously have felt about your own conclusions would be completely set at rest. Never mind for the present what those conclusions are, Mr. Betteredge. I haven't <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> out <b>here</b> to draw me like a badger; I have <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> out <b>here</b> to ask for some information. You might have given it to me no doubt, in the house, instead of out of it. But doors and listeners have a knack of getting together; and, in my line of life, we cultivate a healthy taste for the open air." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you know," [...] {{continued}} the little man, with a deprecatory glance, [...] "w'en {{a man in}} ragged clo'se orders people here about as if 'e was the commander-in-chief o' the British Army, an' flings yellow boys about as if 'e was chancellor o' the checkers, an orders sassengers offhand for all 'ands, 'e may be a gentleman--wery likely 'e is,--but 'e ain't a redooced one, such as slopes into lodgin'-'ouse kitchens. W'atever little game may 'ave <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> <b>'ere,</b> sir, it ain't poverty--an' nobody will be fool enough in this 'ouse to believe it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hare," [...] began August, presently. [...] "I'm {{responsible}} for this cowardly attack on <b>you.</b> I <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> out <b>here.</b> This is the second one. Beware of the third! I see--but tell me, {{do you remember that}} I said you must meet Snap as man to man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{have the}} truth, then!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> {{to be alone}} with you, because I hoped that I might find you a little kinder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bad business, I am afraid, Jeekie. Shouldn't have <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> <b>here,</b> {{or those}} poor beggars either," [...] {{and he looked}} at the scared, frozen Ogula. [...] "I begin to wonder----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come {{here again}} in the morning," [...] she whispered. [...] "You will see then. I <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> {{to show you the}} place. It was here that the {{accident}} happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|FANNY. Thanks. Maybe {{you will}} also mention it to the butler. Possibly also to the--[She {{suddenly}} changes.] Honoria. Suppose it had been you--you know, you're awfully pretty--who had married Lord Bantock, and he had <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> back <b>here,</b> among them all--uncle, aunt, all the lot of them--what would you have done? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, so thou sayest--and joy, too, {{that comes}} with love! Never talk lightly of love, my King, for it <b>brought</b> <b>thee</b> <b>here!</b> La! la! but it is always the way--'The goose on the wing laughs at {{crocodiles}},' so goes their saying down at Alexandria; 'but when the goose is asleep on the water, it is the crocodiles that laugh.' Not but what women are pretty crocodiles. Men worship the crocodiles at Anthribis--Crocodilopolis they call it now, don't they?--but they worship women all the world over! La! how my tongue runs on, and thou about to be crowned Pharaoh! Did I not prophesy it to thee? Well, thou art clean, Lord of the Double Crown. Go forth!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Steve Mokone, a black South African {{who later}} played for Barcelona, left Coventry City after his manager said to him, [...] "We <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> over <b>here</b> and <b>you</b> are not satisfied. That's {{the trouble with}} you people"; Mokone {{interpreted}} this as being racist, and he swiftly signed for Dutch side Heracles Almelo.|$|R
