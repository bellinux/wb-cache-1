5000|$|Proposed in 1931 and {{introduced}} in 1932, the four-colour camouflage patterns incorporated [...] "splinters" [...] {{on top of}} the 1918 colour pattern. The pattern included ochre, rust and brown overlaid on a green foundation, with sharp corners between coloured patches. This new pattern was printed on zeltbahn (triangular tent) material and could also be used as a camouflage rain poncho in the field. Both sides of the material showed the same pattern but the printing was <b>brighter</b> on <b>one</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pius VII's {{imprisonment}} {{did in fact}} {{come with}} <b>one</b> <b>bright</b> <b>side</b> for him. It gave him an aura that recognized him as a living martyr, {{so that when he}} arrived back in Rome in May 1814, he was greeted most warmly by the Italians as a hero.|$|R
50|$|The {{continuous}} casting method {{is much less}} energy intensive and has become the preferred process. For thicknesses below 0.025 mm, two layers are usually put together for the final pass and afterwards separated which produces foil with <b>one</b> <b>bright</b> <b>side</b> and <b>one</b> matte <b>side.</b> The two sides in {{contact with each other}} are matte and the exterior sides become bright; this is done to reduce tearing, increase production rates, control thickness, and get around the need for a smaller diameter roller.|$|R
60|$|They {{slipped out}} into the street, and Ingleby stopped a moment {{at the end of}} it and looked back with a curious {{expression}} in his face. The sunlight that lay <b>bright</b> upon <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of it emphasized its unattractiveness. Tall houses, grim in their squalid ugliness, shut it in, and the hot air that scarcely stirred between them was heavy with the sour odours from a neighbouring tanyard. A hoarse clamour and a woman's voice, high-pitched and shrill with fear or anger, came out of a shadowy alley where unkempt children played in the gutter. The uproar did not concern them. They were apparently used to it.|$|R
50|$|For {{the young}} shoot, the cone of growth is white, {{slightly}} reddish on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> {{and covered with}} thick felt-like white coating. The newly opened first leaf is covered with white-reddish down, on the underside {{is covered with a}} thick-felt like coating, the petiole is also covered with a reddish white coating; the following second and third leaves are lightly coated on the topside, which is grayish and downy. On the underside is a thick felt-like coating; the petiole of the third and fourth leaves is bright-green; violet on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> and slightly covered with hairy down.The young shoot is <b>bright</b> green on <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> while on another - violet, and lightly covered with a grayish hairy coating that becomes more extensive to the tip of a shoot.|$|R
60|$|We were {{surprised}} that, after moving {{as far as}} we had along the valley, we would still meet with the same impervious thickets; and thinking that although the borders of the stream might be lined for some distance with them, yet beyond there might be more open ground, I requested Toby to keep a <b>bright</b> look-out upon <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> while I did the same on the other, in order to discover some opening in the bushes, and especially to watch for the slightest appearance of a path or anything else that might indicate the vicinity of the islanders.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the Chandra {{discovery}} of large scale non [...] thermal emission features in the double lobed SSRL quasar 3 C 207 (z= 0. 684). These are: a diffuse emission well correlated with the western radio lobe, a <b>bright</b> <b>one</b> <b>sided</b> jet whose structure coincides {{with that of the}} eastern radio jet and an X-ray source {{at the tip of the}} jet coincident with the hot spot of the eastern lobe. The diffuse X-ray structure is best interpreted as inverse Compton (IC) scattering of the IR photons from the nuclear source and provides direct observational support to an earlier conjecture (Brunetti et al., 1997) that the spectrum of the relativistic electrons in the lobes of radio galaxies extends to much lower energies than those involved in the synchrotron radio emission. The X-ray luminous and spatially resolved knot along the jet is of particular interest: by combining VLA and Chandra data we show that a SSC model is ruled out, while the X-ray spectrum and flux can be accounted for by the IC scattering of the CMB photons (EIC) under the assumptions of a relatively strong boosting and of an energy distribution of the relativistic electrons as that expected from shock acceleration mechanisms. The X-ray properties of the hot spot are consistent with a SSC model. In all cases we find that the inferred magnetic field strength are lower, but close to the equipartition values. The constraints on the energy distribution of the relativistic electrons, imposed by the X-ray spectra of the observed features, are discussed. To this aim we derive in the Appendices precise semi [...] analytic formulae for the emissivities due to the SSC and EIC processes. Comment: 16 pag. + 13.

40|$|In 'Happiness for All?', Carol Graham raises disquieting {{ideas about}} today’s United States. The {{challenge}} she puts forward {{is an important}} one. Here we review the intellectual case and offer additional evidence. We conclude broadly on the author’s side. Strikingly, Americans {{appear to be in}} greater pain than citizens of other countries, and most sub-groups of citizens have downwardly trended happiness levels. There is, however, <b>one</b> <b>bright</b> <b>side</b> to an otherwise dark story. The happiness of black Americans has risen strongly since the 1970 s. It is now almost equal to that of white Americans...|$|R

6000|$|I {{could fill}} this account with the strange {{relations}} such people give {{every day of}} what they have seen; and every one was so positive of their having seen what they pretended to see, that there was no contradicting them, without breach of friendship, or being accounted rude and unmannerly on the one hand, and profane and impenetrable on the other. One time before the plague was begun, otherwise than as I have said in St. Giles's (I think it was in March), seeing a crowd of people in the street, I joined with them to satisfy my curiosity, and found them all staring up into the air to see what a woman told them appeared plain to her, which was an angel clothed in white, with a fiery sword in his hand, waving it or brandishing it over his head. She described every part of the figure to the life, showed them the motion and the form, and the poor people came into it so eagerly and with so much readiness. [...] "Yes, I see it all plainly," [...] says one: [...] "there's the sword as plain as can be." [...] Another saw the angel; one saw his very face, and cried out what a glorious creature he was. One saw one thing, and one another. I looked as earnestly as the rest, but perhaps not with so much willingness to be imposed upon; and I said, indeed, that I could see nothing but a white cloud, <b>bright</b> on <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> by the shining of the sun upon the other part. The woman endeavored to show it me, but could not make me confess that I saw it; which, indeed, if I had, I must have lied. But the woman, turning to me, looked me in the face, and fancied I laughed, in which her imagination deceived her too, for I really did not laugh, but was seriously reflecting how the poor people were terrified by the force of their own imagination. However, she turned to me, called me profane fellow and a scoffer, {{told me that it was}} a time of God's anger, and dreadful judgments were approaching, and that despisers such as I should wander and perish.|$|R

30|$|In firefly algorithms, the {{attractiveness}} of a firefly is proportional to its brightness. For any couple of flashing fireflies, the less <b>bright</b> <b>one</b> will move toward the <b>brighter</b> <b>one.</b> Attractiveness {{is proportional to the}} brightness which decreases with increasing distance between fireflies. If there are no brighter fireflies than a particular firefly, this individual will move randomly in space. Attractiveness and brightness both increase as their distance decreases. For a maximization problem, the brightness can simply be proportional to the objective function (Gandomi et al. 2011).|$|R
