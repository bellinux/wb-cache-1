25|$|The {{separation}} of the electrodes and the voltage proof of the dielectric material defines the <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> of the capacitor. The <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> {{is proportional to the}} thickness of the dielectric.|$|E
25|$|The {{maximum energy}} {{that can be}} stored safely in a {{capacitor}} {{is limited by the}} <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage.</b> Due to the scaling of capacitance and <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> with dielectric thickness, all capacitors made with a particular dielectric have approximately equal maximum energy density, {{to the extent that the}} dielectric dominates their volume.|$|E
25|$|The <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> can be {{increased}} by using one-sided partially metallized films, or the <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> of the capacitor can {{be increased}} by using double-sided metallized films. Double-sided metallized films also can be combined with internal series-connected capacitors by partial metallization. These multiple technique designs are especially used for high-reliability applications with polypropylene films.|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{results of}} <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> and V-I {{characteristics}} measured {{for the first}} time using coaxial cylindrical electrodes over the pressure range 0. 006 - 0. 72 kPa in sodium, potassium, cadmium, and zinc vapors are reported. The <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> in all the vapors are found to obey Paschen’s Law. The <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> in cadmium and zinc are substantially higher than those in alkaline sodium and potassium, directly in relation to their ionization potentials. The investigations also reveal that the V-I characteristics are pressure dependent and do not exhibit any negative current growth...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{focuses on}} the {{relative}} decrease in the values of power dissipation {{and the increase in}} <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> of 4 H-SiC Schottky barrier devices compared to those with uniformly doped drift regions. The paper also highlights the possibility to design and develop 4 H-SiC Schottky Barrier Diode (SBD) which can yield higher <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> at a lower device thickness by using linearly graded drift region...|$|R
25|$|The {{rated voltage}} {{includes}} a safety margin against the electrolyte's <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> {{at which the}} electrolyte decomposes. The <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> decomposes the separating solvent molecules in the Helmholtz double-layer, f. e. water splits into hydrogen and oxide. The solvent molecules then cannot separate the electrical charges from each other. Higher voltages than rated voltage cause hydrogen gas formation or a short circuit.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{roughness}} of a metallized paper surface can cause many small air-filled bubbles between the dielectric and the metallization, decreasing the <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> of the capacitor. For this reason, larger film capacitors or power capacitors using paper as carrier of the electrodes usually {{are filled with}} an insulating oil or gas, to displace the air bubbles for a higher <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{gives the}} {{historical}} background of 250 year old question: should the Franklin rod tip be sharp or blunt ? The earlier works, the new field results from USA and own laboratory experiments are presented. The switching impulse tests {{were carried out}} with two different shapes of high voltage electrodes: rod or sphere and without additional dc bias voltage. In the arrangement with rod as high voltage electrode the smaller <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> were measured with sharp grounded electrode with negative impulse polarity. At the positive polarity the <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> do {{not depend on the}} shape of grounded electrode. The tests with spherical high voltage electrode showed, that <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> under negative polarity are practically the same for three different grounded electrodes. In spite of that, the remarkable differences in time to breakdown were noted...|$|R
40|$|It is {{possible}} to prepare low‐voltage varistors from the zinc antimony spinel Zn 7 Sb 2 O 12 with <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> {{in the range of}} 3 – 20 V and nonlinearity coefficient α= 7 – 15. The varistor property is due to the formation of high ohmic potential barriers at the grain boundary regions on low‐ohmic n‐type grain interiors of the polycrystalline samples. The method of preparation of the spinel, synthesized by coprecipitation followed by annealing under restricted partial pressures of oxygen, controls the mixed valence states for antimony, namely, Sb 3 + and Sb 5 +. This is critical in attaining high nonlinearity and lower <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages...</b>|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that it is {{possible}} to extend the validity of the Townsend breakdown criterion for evaluating the <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> in the complete pd range in which Paschen curves are available. Evaluation of the <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> for air (pd= 0. 0133 to 1400 kPa · cm), N 2 (pd= 0. 0313 to 1400 kPa · cm) and SF 6 (pd= 0. 3000 to 1200 kPa · cm) has been done and in most cases the computed values are accurate to ± 3 % of the measured values. The computations show that it is also possible to estimate the secondary ionization coefficient ¿ in the pd ranges mentioned above...|$|R
25|$|The voltage {{at which}} the {{dielectric}} becomes conductive is called the <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage,</b> and is given by {{the product of the}} dielectric strength and the separation between the electrodes. The dielectric strength depends on temperature, frequency, shape of the electrodes, etc. Because a breakdown in a capacitor normally is a short circuit and destroys the component, the operating voltage is lower than the <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage.</b> The operating voltage is specified such that the voltage may be applied continuously throughout the life of the capacitor.|$|E
25|$|For most capacitors, a {{physically}} conditioned dielectric strength or a <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> usually could be specified for each dielectric material and thickness. This {{is not possible}} with ceramic capacitors. The <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> of a ceramic dielectric layer may {{vary depending on the}} electrode material and the sintering conditions of the ceramic up to a factor of 10. A high degree of precision and control of process parameters is necessary to keep the scattering of electrical properties for today's very thin ceramic layers within specified limits.|$|E
25|$|The {{substrates}} {{are characterized}} by several key parameters, chiefly thermomechanical (glass transition temperature, tensile strength, shear strength, thermal expansion), electrical (dielectric constant, loss tangent, dielectric <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage,</b> leakage current, tracking resistance...), and others (e.g. moisture absorption).|$|E
25|$|The {{transistors}} Q3, Q4 help {{to increase}} the reverse VBE rating: the base-emitter junctions of the NPN transistors Q1 and Q2 break down at around 7V, but the PNP transistors Q3 and Q4 have VBE <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> around 50 V.|$|R

50|$|The {{transistors}} Q3, Q4 help {{to increase}} the reverse VBE rating: the base-emitter junctions of the NPN transistors Q1 and Q2 break down at around 7V, but the PNP transistors Q3 and Q4 have VBE <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> around 50 V.|$|R
25|$|Forced {{commutation}} — {{in which}} the transient peak reverse recovery current causes such a high voltage drop in the sub-cathode region that it exceeds the reverse <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> of the gate cathode diode junction (SCRs only).|$|E
25|$|Therefore, {{dielectric}} thickness {{does not}} affect energy density within a capacitor of fixed overall dimensions. Using a few thick layers of dielectric can support a high voltage, but low capacitance, while thin layers of dielectric produce a low <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage,</b> but a higher capacitance.|$|E
25|$|Avalanche photodiodes are photodiodes with {{structure}} {{optimized for}} operating with high reverse bias, approaching the reverse <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage.</b> This allows each photo-generated carrier to be multiplied by avalanche breakdown, resulting in internal gain within the photodiode, {{which increases the}} effective responsivity of the device.|$|E
40|$|Measurements {{have been}} made of dc corona onset and <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> for both {{positive}} and negative point/plane electrode systems in compressed sulphur hexafluoride in the presence of water vapour. The presence of moisture lowered the onset voltages and raised the <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> significantly. The effect of moisture on flashover voltages in the presence of metallic particles was also investigated and the results showed that there was little effect except when moisture was likely to be condensing of the spacer surface; If the moisture froze there was again little effect. The reduction in flashover voltage due to moisture was independent of and in addition to the effect of the presence of a metallic particle. Department of Electrical Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|LHCb VELO modules will be {{operated}} in low vacuum with voltages {{as high as}} 500 ~V on both hybrids of the module. This note provides the first study on the <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> of a pre-production VELO module with varying pressures and venting with air. The <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> are measured by studying the leakage currents of the sensors on the module and the measured breakdown curve is compared to the theoretical breakdown for a parallel plate capacitor.

40|$|GaInP/GaAs/GaInP double {{heterojunction}} {{bipolar transistor}} (DHBT) with an Al 0. 11 Ga 0. 89 As layer within lowly doped GaAs–GaInP composite collector was characterized. In comparison to an abrupt GaInP/GaAs/GaInP DHBT with saturation voltages in excess of 20  V, current gains of 25 at high biases, and <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> {{in the range of}} 22  V, the DHBT incorporating GaAs–Al 0. 11 Ga 0. 89 As–GaInP composite collector has demonstrated lower saturation voltages of less than 6  V and high current gains of 50 without compromising the <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> of the GaInP collector. Al 0. 11 Ga 0. 89 As layer can thus provide an alternative design to effectively minimize the potential spike effects at the GaAs/GaInP heterojunction...|$|R
25|$|Ripple and AC {{currents}} mainly warms the capacitor body. By this currents internal generated temperature {{influences the}} <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> of the dielectric. Higher temperature lower the voltage proof of all capacitors. In wet electrolytic capacitors higher temperatures force the evaporation of electrolytes, shortening the life {{time of the}} capacitors. In film capacitors higher temperatures may shrink the plastic film changing the capacitor's properties.|$|E
25|$|The <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> of film {{capacitors}} decreases {{with increasing}} temperature. When using film capacitors at temperatures between the upper rated temperature {{and the upper}} category temperature, only a temperature-derated category voltage VC is allowed. The derating factors apply to both DC and AC voltages. Some manufacturers may have quite different derating curves for their capacitors compared with the generic curves given in the picture at the right.|$|E
25|$|When the anode is at a {{positive}} potential VAK {{with respect to}} the cathode with no voltage applied at the gate, junctions J1 and J3 are forward biased, while junction J2 is reverse biased. As J2 is reverse biased, no conduction takes place (Off state). Now if VAK is increased beyond the <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> VBO of the thyristor, avalanche breakdown of J2 takes place and the thyristor starts conducting (On state).|$|E
50|$|Since {{temperature}} and time {{stability of the}} characteristics of gas diodes and neon lamps is low, and also the statistical dispersion of <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> is high, the above formula can only give a qualitative indication of what the real frequency of oscillation is.|$|R

5000|$|For <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> {{greater than}} 7 volts, the {{semiconductor}} junction width is thicker and primary breakdown mechanism is an avalanche. The noise output is more complicated. There is excess noise (i.e., noise {{over and above}} the simple shot noise) because there is avalanche multiplication.|$|R
25|$|The usual {{breakdown}} {{route is}} that the field strength becomes large enough to pull electrons in the dielectric from their atoms thus causing conduction. Other scenarios are possible, such as impurities in the dielectric, and, if the dielectric is of a crystalline nature, imperfections in the crystal structure can result in an avalanche breakdown as seen in semi-conductor devices. <b>Breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> is also affected by pressure, humidity and temperature.|$|E
25|$|When {{the voltage}} across the {{capacitor}} reaches the <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> of the spark gap (SG) a spark starts, reducing the spark gap resistance {{to a very}} low value. This completes the primary circuit and current from the capacitor flows through the primary coil (L1). The current flows rapidly {{back and forth between}} the plates of the capacitor through the coil, generating radio frequency oscillating current in the primary circuit at the circuit's resonant frequency.|$|E
25|$|Another type of {{transient}} suppressor is the gas-tube suppressor. This {{is a type}} of spark gap that may use air or an inert gas mixture and often, a small amount of radioactive material such as Ni-63, to provide a more consistent <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> and reduce response time. Unfortunately, these devices may have higher breakdown voltages and longer response times than varistors. However, they can handle significantly higher fault currents and withstand multiple high-voltage hits (for example, from lightning) without significant degradation.|$|E
40|$|Measurements of <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> and V-I {{characteristics}} were carried out, using co-axial cylindrical electrodes in Se and Te vapors in the pressure range of 6 × 10 ^- 3 to 1. 131 kPa. A high temperature heat-pipe app. {{developed in the}} laboratory for detetcting the elecronic and plasma properties of metal vapors was used. The <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> in Se and Te vapors are higher than those obtained by earlier workers in Hg, Na, K, Cd and Zn vapors under similar conditions. Since the {{studies were carried out}} in metals in their vapor state, the theory of gas breakdown is considered to explain the variation in the data.

This paper is a consecutive research of the case that the underlying probability distribution is assumed to be a normal model. Similarly to the normal model, the new step-up test method, in the Weibull model, also has advantages compared to the conventional method: (1) the confidence intervals of the estimates become smaller and (2) the estimates can be obtained with higher probability. The bias observed when sample size is small can be reduced by using the bootstrap method...|$|R
