60|$|Early in May {{the winter}} {{congregation}} breaks up, the cliff-breeders {{going back to}} the rocks and the village birds to their chimneys, where they presently set about relining their old nests. There are plenty of places for all, since there are chimneys in almost every cottage where fires are never lighted, and as ventilation is not wanted in bedrooms the birds are allowed to bring in more materials each year, until the whole flue is filled up. Year by year the materials brought in, sink lower and lower until they rest on the closed iron register and change in time to a solid <b>brown</b> <b>mould.</b> Thus, however long-lived a daw may be--and there are probably more centenarians among the daws than among the human inhabitants of the villages--it is a rare thing for one to be disturbed in his tenancy.|$|E

Well, that is what Mrs. Inglethorp did. You will notice that the word 'possessed' is spelt first with one 's' and {{subsequently}} with two--correctly. To make sure, she had further tried it in a sentence, thus: 'I am possessed.' Now, what did that tell me? It told me that Mrs. Inglethorp had been writing the word 'possessed' that afternoon, and, having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh in my mind, the possibility of a will--(a document almost certain to contain that word)--occurred to me at once. This possibility was confirmed by a further circumstance. In the general confusion, the boudoir had not been swept that morning, and near the desk were several traces of <b>brown</b> <b>mould</b> and earth. The weather had been perfectly fine for some days, and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy deposit.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of two postharvest biocontrol products under commercial development was determined in semi-commercial tests on table grapes and sweet cherries. The products consist of the yeast Candida saitoana combined with either chitosan (Bio-Coat) or an antifungal lytic enzyme (Biocure). On table grape (cv. ‘Italia’) field {{applications of the}} two biocontrol products 21 days and 1 day before harvest significantly reduced the incidence of grey mould rots, from 33 to 46 %. Field rots (mainly sour rot) were also reduced on bunches of grapes treated 21 days before harvest. The level of control was {{comparable to that of}} a conventional chemical fungicide (Mepanypirim). On sweet cherries (cv. ‘Lapins’) postharvest dipping treatments significantly reduced total rots (mainly gray and <b>brown</b> <b>mould)</b> by 59 % (Bio-Coat) and 64 % (Biocure). Similar results were obtained on sweet cherries cv. ‘Moreau’. The two biocontrol products did not cause any phytotoxic effect and did not affect the fruit quality...|$|E
40|$|New {{species of}} fungi {{that belong to}} the class Wallemiomycetes and related {{lineages}} were discovered and characterized. The Wallemiomycetes includes species of <b>brown</b> <b>moulds</b> from the genus Wallemia. Further study was warranted for Wallemia sebi because of its ubiquity in the human indoor environments and its potential roles in food spoilage, human allergy and disease. A survey of Wallemia in house dust was conducted. Sequencing of DNA and application of the genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition (GCPSR) led to recognition of four species within the W. sebi species complex (WSSC) and served {{as the foundation for}} phenotypic assessment and the formal description of three new species called W. mellicola, W. canadensis and W. tropicalis. A survey of heat resistant fungi in soils coincidentally resulted in the discovery of a new lineage of fungi related to Wallemia. This new lineage included a previously described monotypic genus Basidioascus and a new sister genus given the name Geminibasidium. A part of the morphological life cycle of these fungi was documented where two new basidial types were discovered, followed by the description of three new species called B. magus, G. donsium and G. hirsutum. Further studies on the sexuality and origins of the species B. undulatus were carried out with genome sequencing, genome analysis, confocal microscopy and electron microscopy. These results {{led to the creation of}} a new class of fungi called the Geminibasidiomycetes, which are distantly related to the Wallemiomycetes. Solving the WSSC, circumscribing a new class of fungi called Geminibasidiomycetes and characterizing the species of Geminibasidiomycetes on a taxonomic and genomic level are my original contributions to scientific knowledge...|$|R

It is manufactured at home or by small cottage industries, using traditional solid-state starters (Men). With the objective of improving the knowledge about the functionality of traditional Men, this study deals with the properties and composition of 29 samples of Vietnamese commercial rice wine starters. We selected 6 rice wine starters for their superior ability to liquefy cooked rice, high ethanol accumulation, and production of attractive flavour and colour in the resulting wine. Ethanol contents reached 12 g/ 100 ml, a sweet alcoholic fragrance was noticed and the wine colour varied from red to lightly <b>brown.</b> Total <b>mould,</b> yeast and bacteria counts in Men were 3. 4 ¿ 6. 0, 5. 8 ¿ 7. 2 and 2. 6 ¿ 6. 2 log CFU/g of dry weight sample, respectively.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of short hypobaric treatments against postharvest rots was investigated by exposing sweet cherries, strawberries and table grapes to sub-atmospheric pressures (0. 25, 0. 50, and 0. 75 atm) for different times (from 1 to 24 h). Postharvest rots of sweet cherries and strawberries arose from natural infections, whereas small table grape bunches and artificially wounded single berries were inoculated with Botrytis cinerea after hypobaric treatment. Sweet cherries exposed to 0. 50 atm for 4 h {{had the lowest}} incidence of gray <b>mould,</b> <b>brown</b> rot and total rots, while a 1 h treatment was not effective. On strawberries, the greatest reductions of gray mould and Rhizopus rot were observed on fruits treated for 4 h at 0. 25 and 0. 50 atm, respectively. On table grape bunches treatment with 0. 25 atm applied for 24 h significantly reduced the incidence of gray mould. In experiments performed with artificially wounded single table grape berries exposed to 0. 50 atm for 24 h and then inoculated, the percentage of infected fruits and {{the diameter of the}} lesions were significantly reduced, in comparison with the controls. As a sub-atmospheric pressure of 0. 25 atm did not affect radial growth of B. cinerea and Monilinia laxa, induced resistance was likely to be responsible for the observed reduction in decay.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of grey mould (caused by Botrytis cinerea) and brown rot (caused by Monilinia laxa) {{in the major}} stone fruit regions in the Western Cape Province was studied over a 3 -year period by samplin g reject fruit from the Unifruco Quality Evaluation Scheme and from 11 stone fruit orchards. Flowers and fruit from the orchards were treated to facilitate disease expression by surface conidia and latent mycelia (unsterile vs. surface sterilised; untreated vs. paraquat-treated). B. cinerea {{was found to be}} the most important pathogen causing blossom blight and postharvest decay on stone fruit. The pathogen was most prominent on early and mid-season cultivars. Surface conidia and latent mycelia consistently occurred on fruit in each orchard, although at fluctuating levels. The amount of B. cinerea on fruits was generally higher during spring than summer. Disease expression on fruit was not governed by the amount of B. cinerea occurring on fruit, but by the ability of fruit to resist disease expression. Blossom infection did not contribute directly to postharvest grey <b>mould.</b> <b>Brown</b> rot was exclusively caused by M. laxa and no evidence was found that M. fructicola had been introduced into the Western Cape Province of South Africa. The pathogen was most prominent on the later maturing cultivars. Immature fruit were generally pathogen-free and disease expression only occurred on maturing fruit. Long-term latency therefore does not seem to play a prominent role in M. laxa fruit rot. Articl...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of chitosan and short hypobaric treatments, {{alone or in}} combination, to control storage decay of sweet cherries, was investigated over 2 years. In single treatments, chitosan was applied by postharvest dipping or preharvest spraying at 0. 1, 0. 5, and 1. 0 % concentrations; hypobaric treatments at 0. 50 and 0. 25 atm were applied for 4 h. In combined treatments, sweet cherries were dipped in 1. 0 % chitosan and then exposed to 0. 50 and 0. 25 atm, or sprayed with chitosan (0. 1, 0. 5, and 1. 0 %) 7 days before harvest and exposed to 0. 50 atm. soon after harvest. Untreated sweet cherries kept at normal pressure (near 1. 00 atm) were used as controls. Rot incidence was evaluated after 14 days storage at 0 +/- 1 degreesC, followed by a 7 day shelf life. In both years, chitosan and hypobaric treatments applied alone significantly reduced <b>brown</b> rot, grey <b>mould,</b> and total rots, the latter also including blue mould, Alternaria, Rhizopus and green rots. A combined treatment with 1. 0 % chitosan and 0. 50 atm was the best in controlling decay, showing in the first year, a synergistic effect in the reduction of brown rot and total rots. The {{results indicate that the}} combination of hypobaric and chitosan treatments is a valid strategy for increasing the {{effectiveness of}} the treatments in controlling postharvest decay of sweet cherries.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of short hyperbaric treatments to control postharvest decay of sweet cherries (Prunus avium L., cv Ferrovia) and table grapes (Vitis vinifera L., cv Italia) was investigated. Sweet cherries and table grape berries {{were exposed to}} the pressure of 1140 mmHg (1. 5 atm) for 4 and 24 It, respectively, in 64 L gas-proof tanks. Fruit kept at ambient pressure (near 760 mmHg, 1. 0 atm) served as a control. Postharvest rots of sweet cherries arose from naturally occurring infections, whereas table grape berries were artificially wounded, exposed to the hyperbaric treatment, then the wounds inoculated with 20 mu L of a Botrytis cinerea conidial suspension (5 x 10 (4) spores mL(- 1)). Sweet cherries were stored at 0 +/- 1 degrees C for 14 d, followed by 7 d at 20 +/- 1 degrees C. Table grapes berries were kept at 20 +/- 1 degrees C for 3 d. On sweet cherries, hyperbaric treatment reduced the incidence of <b>brown</b> rot, grey <b>mould,</b> and blue mould, with respect to the control. Similarly; on treated table grapes a significant reduction of lesion diameter and percentage of B. cinerea infected berries was observed. Induced resistance was likely to be responsible for the observed decay reduction. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the {{effectiveness of}} short hyperbaric treatments in controlling postharvest decay of sweet cherries and table grapes. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The use {{of plant}} {{extracts}} {{could be a}} useful alternative to synthetic fungicides {{in the management of}} rot fungi during postharvest handling of fruit and vegetables. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the in vitro and in vivo activity of extracts obtained from nine wild edible herbaceous species (Borago officinalis, Orobanche crenata, Plantago coronopus, P. lanceolata, Sanguisorba minor, Silene vulgaris, Sonchus asper, Sonchus oleraceus, and Taraxacum officinale) against some important postharvest pathogens, i. e. Botrytis cinerea, Monilinia taxa, Penicillium digitatum, P. expansum, P. italicum, Aspergillus carbonarius, and A. niger. Phenolic composition of all extracts was evaluated by HPLC. Several derivatives of caffeic acid, of the flavones apigenin and luteolin, and of the flavonols kaempferol and quercetin, were identified. Extracts from S. minor and O. crenata showed the highest efficacy in all the trials. In particular, S. minor completely inhibited in vitro the conidial germination of M. laxa, P. digitatum, P. italicum, and A. niger and strongly reduced those of B. cinerea; O. crenata extract showed a lower but still significant reduction of conidial germination on all the tested fungi. Moreover, the extracts from both species were effective in reducing the germ tube elongation also when a slight inhibition of conidial germination was observed. In many cases, a dose effect was observed, with an increase of antifungal activity as the phenolic concentration increased. In trials performed on wounded fruit, S. minor extract completely inhibited brown rot on apricots and nectarines; O. crenata extract strongly reduced grey <b>mould,</b> <b>brown</b> rot, and green mould on table grapes, apricots and nectarines, and oranges, respectively. The inhibition efficacy of extracts was ascribed to the presence of some caffeic acid derivatives and/or flavonoids. HPLC phenolic analyses provided useful information to identify the possible active compounds. (C) 2011 Elsevier By. All rights reserved...|$|R
