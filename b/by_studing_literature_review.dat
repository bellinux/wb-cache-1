Main aim of this work is to design a methodology, which can be use for project cost estimation in the initial part of the project stadium. Defining a basic terms of the project management and describing the most widely use cost estimation metods are the first step to archive main aim. This will be achived <b>by</b> <b>studing</b> <b>literature</b> and relevant articles of the project management. Next step is find an appropriate factors which help to set up the methodology. This factors can derive from a stakeholder's analysis. After definition these factors there si possible to set up a particular methodology. Universality (for a wide group of the projects), accuracy (to determine a particular method) and usability (in the initial part of the project stadium) are the most important criteria to review this methodology. Finally, it is necessary to evaluate the proposed methodology. This can be achieved by comparing the methods recommended in the methodology and the methods actually used for the real project cost estimation. The expected benefits of this work are the most widely use cost estimation metods arrangement and creation of the recommended metodology which can be used to cost estimation of future projects...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} that face students, lecturers, and scholars is to <b>review</b> the <b>literature</b> that has preceded them. Essays and <b>literature</b> <b>reviews</b> may be read and written by students. Lecturers may also read essays and reviews, and write reviews and then submit the article to journals. It is therefore important that these two groups of people understand the aim of <b>literature</b> <b>reviews</b> {{and are able to}} tell the difference between a review and other types of written work. The number of students that approached the author and the presentations by lecturers at various conferences indicates that students and lecturers could be better informed of the aim of a <b>literature</b> <b>review.</b> This article argues that a sound understanding of the aim of a <b>literature</b> <b>review</b> would equip students and lecturers so that the purpose of a <b>literature</b> <b>review</b> can be correctly achieved. With the aid of other conference presentations and publication material, this article describes the aims of: essays, <b>literature</b> <b>reviews,</b> and journal article submissions. The three types of articles are compared, with an emphasis on <b>literature</b> <b>reviews</b> and how they differ from essays and journal articles. The paper also provides useful descriptions of <b>literature</b> <b>review</b> purposes that will assist students on successful essay and <b>literature</b> <b>review</b> writing. Essays are prescriptive whereas <b>literature</b> <b>reviews</b> are described as research involving analysis and research implication statements.

40|$|<b>Literature</b> <b>reviews</b> play an {{important}} role in the development of knowledge. Yet, we observe a lack of theoretical underpinning of and epistemological insights into how <b>literature</b> <b>reviews</b> can contribute to knowledge creation and have actually contributed in the IS discipline. To address these theoretical and empirical research gaps, we suggest a novel epistemological model of <b>literature</b> <b>reviews.</b> This model allows us to align different contributions of <b>literature</b> <b>reviews</b> with their underlying knowledge conversions - thereby building a bridge between the previously largely unconnected fields of <b>literature</b> <b>reviews</b> and epistemology. We evaluate the appropriateness of the model by conducting an empirical analysis of 173 IS <b>literature</b> <b>reviews</b> which were published in 39 pertinent IS journals between 2000 and 2014.

40|$|The <b>literature</b> <b>review</b> is {{fundamental}} to the doctoral enterprise of academic disciplines, yet research into how the doctoral <b>literature</b> <b>review</b> is learned, taught or experienced is limited. Responding to an apparent under-examination of the <b>literature</b> <b>review</b> as a critical feature of doctoral learning, this thesis investigates the doctoral <b>literature</b> <b>review</b> process as experienced by American and Australian doctoral candidates, doctoral supervisors and academic librarians. The research followed a qualitative approach shaped by two questions: "How is the doctoral <b>literature</b> <b>review</b> process learned?" and, "What is learned by doing a doctoral literature review?" Data were generated from in-depth interviews conducted with 42 participants in education, nursing and the physical and biological sciences. Critical literacy, critical pedagogy and critical information literacy provided frameworks for interpreting participants‘ experiences and perspectives on <b>literature</b> <b>reviewing</b> practices, disciplinary influences and mutually associated doctoral literacies. The doctoral <b>literature</b> <b>review</b> is traditionally considered to be two segregated events—literature seeking and writing in an academic genre. The study findings challenge this perspective, proposing instead that doctoral <b>literature</b> <b>reviewing</b> is a complex, comprehensive process characterised by interdependent activities in a cycle of gathering, reflecting upon and synthesising literatures. Moreover, these findings indicate that, by engaging with disciplinary literatures and the <b>literature</b> <b>review</b> process, doctoral researchers become familiar {{with an array of}} critical doctoral literacies—disciplinary literacy, information literacy and reading and writing literacies. Thus, the doctoral <b>literature</b> <b>review</b> can be conceptualised as a pedagogy through which candidates acquire the lived practices and craft skills of disciplinary-specific research; learn to manage large bodies of information, literature and knowledge; and learn to read and write as scholars in their disciplines. This project reconceptualises traditional perspectives on doctoral <b>literature</b> <b>reviewing</b> and recommends further exploration into its pedagogical potential. By approaching the doctoral <b>literature</b> <b>review</b> as a pedagogical process, the inquiry attempts to unpack literacies embedded within the doctoral enterprise, thereby exposing them as explicit aspects of doctoral learning. Becoming aware of the interrelatedness of critical doctoral literacies can mobilise supervisors, librarians and candidates to exploit the <b>literature</b> <b>review</b> process more fully. Ultimately, this research contributes to an international focus on a central feature of the doctorate and, as such, more broadly informs and supports doctoral pedagogy, particularly for those involved in American and Australian doctoral education. <br /...|$|R
