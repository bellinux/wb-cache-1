5|$|The Republican {{convention}} met first, convening in Chicago, Illinois, on June 2. Of the men {{vying for}} the Republican nomination, the three strongest candidates {{leading up to the}} convention were former president Ulysses S. Grant, Senator James G. Blaine and Treasury Secretary John Sherman. Grant had been the leading military commander for the Northern forces during the Civil War, and had served two terms as president from 1869 to 1877. He was seeking an unprecedented third term in the office. He was <b>backed</b> <b>by</b> Conkling's faction of the Republican Party, now known as the Stalwarts. They are mainly known for their opposition to the civil service reforms sought by President Hayes. Blaine, a senator and former representative from Maine, was <b>backed</b> <b>by</b> the Half-Breed faction of the party, which did support civil service reform. Sherman, the brother of Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, was a former senator from Ohio serving in Hayes's cabinet. He was <b>backed</b> <b>by</b> a smaller delegation that supported neither of the major factions.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was now precarious and violence appeared likely as the rebels prepared to unleash a volley of arrows.

Tyler's head was cut off and displayed on a pole and, with their leader dead and the royal government now <b>backed</b> <b>by</b> the London militia, the rebel movement began to collapse. Richard promptly knighted Walworth and his leading supporters for their services.|$|E

5|$|In 1531, the ikki {{control of}} Kaga was of such {{dominance}} that a conflict for leadership within the Hongan-ji embroiled the province {{in a civil}} war, often called the Daishō-Ikki, or Big League-Little League, war. A faction led by Renjun, a son of Rennyo, {{came to power in}} the Hongan-ji, and was hostile to the three main Kaga temples. In the resultant war, the three Kaga temples were <b>backed</b> <b>by</b> the Togashi clan, other powerful vassals, local Hongan-ji priests, and the ikki based in Echizen. Renjun was <b>backed</b> <b>by</b> many of the smaller temples and emerged victorious from the conflict when he brought in an Ikkō-Ikki army from Mikawa Province. Togashi Taneyasu was exiled, as were the other opposition leaders, and the position of shugo abolished.|$|E

MacGuire told him {{that a group of}} businessmen, supposedly <b>backed</b> <b>by</b> a private army of 500,000 ex-soldiers and others, intended to establish a fascist dictatorship. Butler had been asked to lead it, he said, by MacGuire, who was a bond salesman with Grayson M–P Murphy & Co. The New York Times reported that Butler had told friends that General Hugh S. Johnson, former head of the National Recovery Administration, was to be installed as dictator, and that the J.P. Morgan banking firm was behind the plot. Butler told Congress that MacGuire had told him the attempted coup was <b>backed</b> <b>by</b> three million dollars, and that the 500,000 men were probably to be assembled in Washington, D.C. the following year. All the parties alleged to be involved publicly said there was no truth in the story, calling it a joke and a fantasy.|$|E
