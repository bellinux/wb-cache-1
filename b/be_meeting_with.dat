500|$|During Tankersley's {{tenure as}} {{publisher}} of the Times-Herald, the paper was embroiled in two controversies related to McCarthy, one involving attacks intended to help unseat Democratic Senator Millard E. Tydings in 1950, {{and the other a}} lawsuit brought by Drew Pearson in 1951 over what Pearson viewed as a [...] "conspiracy to smear his reputation". In the Tydings case, a composite photograph created by Garvin Tankersley made Tydings appear to <b>be</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> a communist party leader and was a factor in Tydings losing his race. It also brought Bazy and her paper {{to the attention of the}} United States Senate, where the paper's treatment of Tydings was viewed by a bipartisan Senate panel as a violation of [...] "simple decency and honesty" [...] and [...] "a shocking abuse of the spirit and intent of the First Amendment of the Constitution". The lawsuit was a $5.1 million cause filed by Pearson against multiple defendants, including McCarthy and the Times-Herald, Westbrook Pegler and Fulton Lewis, alleging they had [...] "contrived... to hold plaintiff up to public scorn and ridicule". Pearson frequently criticized McCarthy, McCarthy criticized Pearson in a speech on the floor of the Senate, and the two men had even been in a physical altercation in December 1950. The Times-Herald ran articles critical of Pearson and in one case described Pearson as a [...] "New Deal communist", though it was asserted to have been a typographical error that should have read [...] "columnist".|$|E

The civilization would not be looking for anything except knowledge, therefore we would likely never notice it.|$|E
