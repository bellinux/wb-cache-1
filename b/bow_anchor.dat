5|$|In 1969, Fitzgerald {{received}} a safety award {{for eight years}} of operation without a time-off worker injury. The vessel ran aground in 1969, and she collided with SS Hochelaga in 1970. Later that same year, she struck {{the wall of a}} lock, an accident repeated in 1973 and 1974. During 1974, she lost her original <b>bow</b> <b>anchor</b> in the Detroit River. None of these mishaps, however, were considered serious or unusual. Freshwater ships were built to last more than half a century, and Fitzgerald should still have had a long career ahead of her when she sank.|$|E
5|$|At 20:45, with Jason {{far behind}} in the darkness, Mars hauled up and Hood {{attempted}} to manoeuvre into an effective position from which to attack the waiting Hercule. The vagaries of the current in the Raz de Sein passage prevented Hood from handling his ship effectively however and instead he resolved on bringing Mars directly alongside and fighting broadside to broadside. At 21:15 Mars was in range and L'Héritier opened fire, Hood replying immediately. For ten minutes, the masts and rigging of Mars came under fire, with damage to the bowsprit and foremast, as Hood continued to attempt to hold his firing position against the current before pulling slightly ahead of Hercule at 21:25 and dropping anchor. The port <b>bow</b> <b>anchor</b> became entangled with the starboard anchor on Hercule and the British ship was swung violently into the French ship, {{the force of the}} collision unhinging four of the gunports on Mars.|$|E
5|$|Within {{minutes of}} the British attack, Ceylon {{surrendered}} and boats from Magicienne sought but failed to take possession of her. The French crew drove the captured East Indiaman on shore, joined shortly afterwards by Minerve, Bellone and later by Victor, so that by 6:30 pm the entire French force was grounded and all but Bellone prevented from firing their main broadsides by beached ships blocking their arc of fire. Bellone however was ideally positioned to maintain her fire on Nereide from her beached position, and at 7:00 pm a cannon shot cut Nereides stern anchor cable. The British frigate swung around, presenting her stern to Bellone and pulling both her broadsides away from the French squadron. Raked by Bellone and desperate to return fire, Willoughby had the <b>bow</b> <b>anchor</b> cable cut, bringing {{a portion of his}} ship's starboard broadside to bear on Bellone. At 8:00 pm, Duperré was seriously wounded in the cheek by shrapnel from a grape shot fired by Nereide; Ensign Vigoureux concealed his unconscious body under a signal flag and discreetly brought him below decks while Bouvet assumed command of the French squadron on board Bellone, placing Lieutenant Albin Roussin in charge of Minerve. Building an improvised bridge between the French ships and the shore, Bouvet increased the men and ammunition reaching Bellone and thus significantly increased her rate of fire. He also had the rail removed between the foredeck and the quarterdeck of Minerve, and had iron hooks nailed to the freeboard below the starboard gangway as to provide attachment points for additional guns, thus building a continuous second deck on his frigate where he constituted a complete second battery. By 10:00 pm Nereide was a wreck, receiving shot from several sides, with most of her guns dismounted and casualties mounting to over 200: the first lieutenant was dying, the second was severely wounded and Willoughby's left eye had been dislodged from its socket by a wooden splinter. Recognising her battered state, Bouvet then diverted fire from Nereide to concentrate on Magicienne.|$|E
50|$|On 14 October 2014, {{an anchor}} {{believed}} to have belonged to Niobe was unearthed at HMC Dockyard in Halifax. The particular anchor, and the location it was discovered, is consistent with being from Niobe. The anchor {{is believed to be}} one of her three <b>bow</b> <b>anchors</b> used to secure her in her new position following the Halifax Explosion.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this case}} report was to {{evaluate}} the results of deep overbite correction by the segmented arch technique. METHODS: The first stage of the treatment was performed with this technique to intrude incisors and canines. A maxillary transpalatal bar and a mandibular lingual arch using 0. 051 -in archwire were employed associated to a facial <b>bow,</b> <b>anchored</b> primarily with occipital pull and, after molar relationship correction, changed to high pull. RESULTS: Upper incisors presented {{a great amount of}} intrusion and some palatal root inclination as programmed in the treatment plan. The skeletal mandibular response was favorable to achieve profile balance. Periapical radiograph showed rounded apex of incisor roots, expected in any orthodontic intrusion movement. CONCLUSION: The clinical results present the successful approach to deep overbite malocclusion...|$|R
50|$|During the First Barbary War (1801-1805), Philadelphia cruised off Tripoli until October 31, 1803, {{while giving}} chase and firing upon a pirate ship she ran aground on an uncharted reef two miles off Tripoli Harbor. The Captain, William Bainbridge, tried to refloat her, first laying the sails back, and casting off three <b>bow</b> <b>anchors</b> and {{shifting}} the guns rear-ward. But {{a strong wind}} and rising waves drove her further aground. Next they dumped many of her cannons, barrels of water, and other heavy articles overboard {{in order to make}} her lighter but this too failed. They then sawed off the foremast in one last desperate attempt to lighten her. All of these attempts failed and Bainbridge, in order not to resupply the pirates, ordered holes drilled in the ship's bottom, gunpowder dampened, sheets set afire and all other weapons thrown overboard before surrendering. Her officers and men were made slaves of the Pasha (or Bashaw).|$|R

500|$|As Hercule {{approached}} the channel, Hood put Mars on the starboard tack, overtaking Jason and {{bearing down on}} the French ship. At 20:30, L'Héritier recognised that the current was too strong for Hercule to successfully navigate the Raz de Sein and instead anchored [...] {{at the mouth of}} the channel with a spring on his cable, a system of attaching the <b>bow</b> <b>anchor</b> that increased stability and allowed L'Héritier to swing his broadside to face the enemy while stationary, roughly [...] southwest of Pointe de Raz and about [...] from his destination at Brest.|$|E
500|$|Jurien {{recognised}} {{immediately that}} his force was severely outnumbered and steered for the coast {{in search of}} a safe anchorage. The best available was the town of Les Sables-d'Olonne, which had a small harbour protected by gun batteries. At 09:10 Amelia was in range to fire on Cybèles stern before the British frigate dropped back to join Stopford's rapidly advcing force. The French then anchored under the batteries of the town with [...] "springs" [...] on their anchor cables, a system of attaching the <b>bow</b> <b>anchor</b> that increased stability and allowed the ships to swing their broadsides to face an enemy while stationary.|$|E
50|$|Later she was {{surrendered}} to the Allied nations, repaired, and arrived at Hamburg on 3 August 1920. She left Hamburg for the UK, in ballast, and was wrecked on 3 September 1921 on Knivestone, Farne Islands. Considered {{to be the largest}} wreck on the Farnes, she remains popular with divers and her broken <b>bow</b> section, <b>anchor</b> and chain lie to {{the west side of the}} Knivestone Reef.|$|R

500|$|At daybreak on 28 September 1918, Gorgon, {{in company}} with , {{anchored}} about [...] off De Panne, Belgium {{and opened fire}} about 7:15 on a bridge at Snaeskerke, Belgium at a range of [...] Conditions were not good as both wind and tide were against her. Gorgons stern anchor cable parted and she swung around on her <b>bow</b> <b>anchor</b> so that only her rear turret could bear on the target. No aircraft were made available to spot for her so there was little chance of a hit and she only fired eleven rounds. She, and the other monitors, were attacked {{several times during the}} day by German aircraft with little effect and several coast defense batteries attempted to engage them through the smokescreen put up by the motor launches supporting the operation. She fired thirteen shells the next day in another attempt to destroy the bridge and claimed one hit although this was not confirmed by subsequent observations.|$|E
500|$|With Kronan as its flagship, {{the fleet}} went to sea in October 1675 under Admiral of the Realm (riksamiral) Gustaf Otto Stenbock, but got no farther than Stora Karlsö off Gotland. The weather was unusually cold and stormy and the ships {{could not be}} heated. The crew were poorly clothed and soon many of them fell ill. Supplies dwindled, and after Kronan lost a <b>bow</b> <b>anchor</b> after {{less than two weeks}} at sea, Stenbock decided to turn back to the Dalarö {{anchorage}} north of Stockholm. Nothing came of the reinforcements of the North German provinces. King Charles reacted with anger and held Stenbock personally responsible for the failed expedition, forcing him to pay more than 100,000 dalers out of his own pocket. King Charles later rehabilitated Stenbock by giving him an army appointment in Norway, but in early 1676 he replaced him with Lorentz Creutz, a prominent treasury official. Naval historian Jan Glete has explained this as a step that was [...] "necessary in a time of crisis" [...] due to Creutz's administrative skills and treasury connections, but Creutz had no experience as a naval commander, something that would later prove crucial.|$|E
500|$|Nelson {{ordered the}} fleet {{to slow down}} at 16:00 to allow his ships to rig [...] "springs" [...] on their anchor cables, a system of {{attaching}} the <b>bow</b> <b>anchor</b> that increased stability and allowed his ships to swing their broadsides to face an enemy while stationary. It also increased manoeuvrability and therefore reduced the risk of coming under raking fire. Nelson's plan, shaped through discussion with his senior captains during the return voyage to Alexandria, was to advance on the French and pass down the seaward side of the van and centre of the French line, so that each French ship would face two British ships and the massive Orient would be fighting against three. The direction of the wind meant that the French rear division {{would be unable to}} join the battle easily and would be cut off from the front portions of the line. To ensure that in the smoke and confusion of a night battle his ships would not accidentally open fire on one another, Nelson ordered that each ship prepare four horizontal lights at the head of their mizzen mast and [...] hoist an illuminated White Ensign, which was different enough from the French tricolour {{that it would not be}} mistaken in poor visibility, reducing the risk that British ships might fire on one another in the darkness. As his ship was readied for battle, Nelson held a final dinner with Vanguards officers, announcing as he rose: [...] "Before this time tomorrow I shall have gained a peerage or Westminster Abbey," [...] in reference to the rewards of victory or the traditional burial place of British military heroes.|$|E
500|$|... e. [...] Darby {{may have}} {{intended}} to anchor alongside the 80-gun Franklin, the ship immediately ahead of Orient, {{or to have}} tacked alongside the gap between Franklin and Orient, {{so as to be}} able to rake Orients bows.

Adkin prefers the explanation that Darby intended to rake Orients <b>bows,</b> but the <b>anchor</b> had dragged.|$|R
25|$|Salvage divers from Halliburton first {{detached}} the bow {{from the}} rest of the vessel because it may have contained unexploded torpedo warheads and because it could break off and destabilise the lifting. The divers installed two large hydraulic suction anchors into the seabed and attached a high-strength tungsten carbide abrasive saw that was pulled back and forth over the <b>bow</b> between the <b>anchors.</b> It took ten days to detach the bow.|$|R

60|$|This {{unpleasant}} {{information was}} not long delayed. The little steamer pitched and plunged more violently than before, but without the sickening motion of being dragged under, which was apparent when the <b>bow</b> <b>anchor</b> held, and after ten minutes of this wild tossing she lurched forward suddenly as if the screw had been set in motion.|$|E
60|$|At {{five o'clock}} in the {{afternoon}} the gale was full upon them, coming directly out of the east, and so furiously did the little craft toss and pitch that Bob took the precaution of stretching life-lines fore and aft.

500|$|General Wolfe was {{assigned}} to the Dover Patrol on 15 August 1918, but did not fire on any targets until 28 September, when a large force of monitors was gathered to harass German lines of communication. She was <b>anchored</b> <b>bow</b> and stern, broadside to her target, and had difficulties dealing with the tidal currents. She opened fire on the railway bridge at Snaeskerke ( [...] south of Ostend) at a range of [...] and made naval history as the heaviest shell fired from the largest gun at the longest range in action to date. She fired 52 shells that day and found that the recoil from her 18–inch gun moved her sideways with her shallow hull and also caused her to roll, which slowed her rate of fire. She fired a total of 81 rounds {{before the end of the}} war.|$|R
