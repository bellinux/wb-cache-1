5|$|Romanian vampires {{were said}} to bite their victims over the heart or <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> and sudden deaths could {{indicate}} {{the presence of a}} vampire. Graves were often opened five or seven years after burial and the corpse checked for vampirism, before being washed and reburied.|$|E
5|$|The front (rostral) part of {{the skull}} is shortshorter and broader than in T.hylophilusand flat and the notches in the {{zygomatic}} plates at the sides are poorly developed. The plates themselves are broad. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) spread broadly and are rounded in shape. The narrow interorbital region (<b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes)</b> is hourglass-shaped. The braincase is robust.|$|E
5|$|The nasal bones end bluntly {{close to}} the hindmost extent of the premaxillary bones. The narrow interorbital region, located <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> converges towards the front and is flanked by low beads. The interparietal bone, located in {{the roof of the}} skull on the braincase, is nearly as wide as the frontals, but does not reach the squamosals.|$|E
50|$|The skull {{measures}} on average 16.3 mm in length. The palate averages 6.82 mm {{in length and}} <b>the</b> distance <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> sockets averages 3.31 mm. The cranium is around 4.59 mm long and 7.96 mm wide. The overall shape of the skull is rather flat and broad, with a depression <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> sockets.|$|R

5|$|Herrerasaurus had a long, narrow skull that lacked {{nearly all}} the specializations that {{characterized}} later dinosaurs, and more closely resembled those of more primitive archosaurs such as Euparkeria. It had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings) in its skull, two pairs of which were for the eyes and nostrils. <b>Between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> and the nostrils were two antorbital fenestrae {{and a pair of}} tiny, 1-centimeter-long (0.4in) slit-like holes called promaxillary fenestrae.|$|E
5|$|The Danube crested newt's {{back and}} sides are dark brown with black spots and white stippling. The belly is orange to red (in other crested newts, {{it is usually}} yellow or orangeâ€“yellow), with small or {{medium-sized}} black blotches that have sharp edges. Like all crested newts, T.dobrogicus males develop a crest on their back and tail during breeding phase, which can be quite high and jagged and usually starts <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> and nostrils. Another feature of males at breeding season is a bluish-white stripe along the tail.|$|E
5|$|The skull is {{flattened}} {{in general}} shape. The front part {{is short and}} broad. The broad interorbital region (located <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes)</b> is hourglass-shaped, with squared edges and weakly developed beading. A postorbital ridge is present, obscuring the suture (joint) between the frontal and squamosal bones, a feature shared only with Holochilus among oryzomyines. The braincase is squarish. The interparietal bone is wide, but does not reach the squamosals on the sides. The zygomatic arches, which are well-developed, are furthest apart at the back and converge toward the front. The jugal bone is small.|$|E

5|$|At the back, the nasals are {{separated}} by the frontal in K. langenbergensis, the back third of which is somewhat vaulted. The portion of the frontal <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> is one-third {{the width of the}} entire skull in both species, but it widens further back to form the front of the skull roof. The prefrontal is straight along its contact with the frontal and nasal (about half of the bone is in contact with each), but forms an angle between the margin of the eye socket and the lacrimal on the other side. This angle is rounded in K. guimarotae such that the bone is oval-shaped, but very pointed in K. langenbergensis such that the bone is triangular.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, {{the front}} part (rostrum) is large, {{but not as}} long as in A.budini. The skull is more robust than in the very similar Akodon boliviensis, but less so than in A.simulator. The hourglass-shaped interorbital region (<b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes)</b> is {{narrower}} than in A.caenosus and not as squared as in A.polopi. Members of the Akodon varius group, with which Akodon oenos was formerly associated, tend to have much broader interorbital regions. The braincase is somewhat inflated and bears well-developed temporal and lambdoid crests relative to the situation in A.caenosus; Akodon polopi has even better developed crests.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) {{is large}} and robust. The nasal bones are short, not {{extending}} further back than the lacrimals, and the premaxillaries extend about {{as far back as}} the nasals. The zygomatic plate is narrow and lacks a zygomatic notch, an extension of the plate at the front. The plate's back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. The narrowest part of the interorbital region, located <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> is to the front and its margins exhibit strong beading. Various crests develop on the long braincase, especially in old animals. The parietal bones form part of the roof of the braincase and, unlike in some other rice rats, also extend to the sides of the braincase.|$|E

50|$|Hypertelorism is an {{abnormally}} increased {{distance between}} two organs or bodily parts, usually referring {{to an increased}} distance <b>between</b> <b>the</b> orbits (<b>eyes),</b> or orbital hypertelorism. In this condition <b>the</b> distance <b>between</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>eye</b> corners as well as <b>the</b> distance <b>between</b> <b>the</b> pupils is greater than normal. Hypertelorism {{should not be confused}} with telecanthus, in which <b>the</b> distance <b>between</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>eye</b> corners is increased but that of <b>the</b> outer <b>eye</b> corners remains unchanged. Therefore <b>the</b> distance <b>between</b> <b>the</b> pupils is normal.|$|R
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{relatively}} long. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend {{in front of}} the incisors, forming a rostral tube, which is shared among oryzomyines only with Handleyomys. The zygomatic notch (a notch formed by a projection {{at the front of the}} zygomatic plate, a bony plate at the side of the skull) is shallow. The interorbital region (<b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes)</b> is narrow and long, with the narrowest part towards the front. The crests on the braincase and interorbital region are weakly developed. Eremoryzomys has larger crests on its interorbital region.|$|E
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} is congenital and {{is characterized by}} a number of nasal, facial and cranial features. These include a broad and high, sometimes depressed nasal bridge (top of the nose, <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes)</b> and a flattened nasal tip. This can give the nose a shortened, arch-like appearance. Hypertelorism (unusually wide-set eyes), prominent frontal bones and supraorbital ridge (the eyebrow ridge), bilateral epicanthic folds (an extra flap of skin over the eyelids), a broad forehead and an overall enlarged head circumference have also been observed. A bulging of the upper lip with an exaggerated cupid's bow shape, and maxillary hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the upper jaw) with retraction have also been reported.|$|E
5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse has a {{large and}} robust skull with {{well-developed}} zygomatic arches (cheekbones). The interorbital region of the skull (<b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes)</b> is smooth, as in greater big-footed mouse, and lacks the shelves characteristic of the bastard big-footed mouse. The palate is broad and the incisive foramina (openings in the front portion of the palate) are long and broad. In the mandible (lower jaw), {{the root of the}} lower incisor is housed in a distinct capsular process, a protuberance {{at the back of the}} jawbone. The lower masseteric ridge (a crest on the outer side of the mandible) is prominent. As is typical of Macrotarsomys, the molars are cuspidate and low-crowned.|$|E
50|$|Two species (H. aztecus and H. gertschi) were {{separated}} {{and placed in}} the genus Hoffmannihadrurus based on <b>the</b> larger distance <b>between</b> <b>the</b> lateral <b>eyes</b> and <b>the</b> anterior margin of the carapace as well as <b>the</b> shorter distance <b>between</b> <b>the</b> median <b>eyes</b> and <b>the</b> lateral <b>eyes.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{snakes and}} reptiles, a loreal scale also {{refers to the}} scales which lie <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and <b>the</b> nostril. In crotaline snakes (pit vipers), loreal pits are present {{on either side of}} the head.|$|R
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, muscular, compact {{dog that}} gives the {{impression}} of agility and strength. It has a broad skull that flattens to a definite stop <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> with muscular cheeks and a medium-length, deep, powerful muzzle. The ears are pricked, small to medium in size and set wide apart, with a covering of hair on the inside. The eyes are oval and dark, with an alert, keen expression. The neck and shoulders are strong and muscular; the forelegs are straight and parallel; and the feet round and arched, with small, sturdy toes and nails.|$|E
5|$|The Sunda slow loris has dark rings {{around its}} large eyes, a white nose with a whitish strip that {{extends to the}} {{forehead}} and a dark stripe that stretches {{from the back of}} the head along the spine. Its soft, thick, woolly fur ranges from light brown to deep reddish brown, with a lighter underside. The species is distinct from the Bengal slow loris due to the dark inverse teardrop markings around the eyes which meet the dark dorsal stripe on the back of the head. It tends to have a much more distinct white stripe <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> more distinct dark coloring around the eyes, and a browner coat than the Bengal slow loris which is larger, grayer, and shows less contrast. The Sunda slow loris has less white facial coloring than the much smaller pygmy slow loris. Local color variations are known to occur.|$|E
5|$|The muzzle is {{narrow and}} long. The lower eyelid {{contains}} a large, transparent disk. The head is olive-brown. There are black scales {{with a white}} border <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> and the ears. The body is somewhat darker than the head and covered with irregular black and white spots above and is bluish white below. The limbs are yellowish white below. The tail is light brown above, but has two rows of darker spots, and yellowish white below. Snout-to-vent length is 83mm (3.3in), head length 10mm (0.39in), head width 6.5mm (0.26in), length of the body 33mm (1.3in), length of the forelimb 15mm (0.59in), length of the hindlimb 23mm (0.91in), and length of the (incomplete) tail 40mm (1.6in).|$|E
50|$|The ICL is {{implanted}} under pharmacological mydriasis and {{implanted in}} <b>the</b> retropupillay position, <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye's</b> iris and <b>the</b> crystalline lens, using cartridge-injector or forceps. Both eyes {{can usually be}} done on the same day.|$|R
5000|$|The {{palpebral fissure}} is <b>the</b> {{elliptic}} space <b>between</b> <b>the</b> medial and lateral canthi {{of the two}} open lids. In simple terms, it refers to <b>the</b> opening <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> lids. In adults, this measures about 10mm vertically and 30mm horizontally.|$|R
50|$|After this is accomplished, all lit {{surfaces}} will {{correspond to}} a 0 in the stencil buffer, where {{the numbers of}} front and back surfaces of all shadow volumes <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and that surface are equal.|$|R
5|$|The scales {{along the}} lips of the snake are called labials. Those on the upper lip are called supralabials or upper labials, while those on the lower lip are called infralabials or lower labials. On top of the head, <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{adjacent}} to the supraoculars is the frontal scale. The prefrontal scales are the scales connected to the frontal towards {{the tip of the}} snout which are in contact with the internasals. They may have a scale in between them. The back of {{the top of the head}} has scales connected to the frontal scale called the parietal scales. At the sides of the back of the head between the parietals above and the supralabials below are scales called temporal scales.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{has a long}} rostrum (front part), broad interorbital region (<b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes),</b> and low braincase. It {{differs from}} that of T.bolivaris in various proportions, which are more {{apparent}} in adults than in juveniles. The skull of H.megacephalus is distinctly larger. The zygomatic plate is broad and includes a well-developed zygomatic notch at its front. Its back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. The zygomatic arch (cheekbone) is heavy. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend about as far backward. The interorbital region is narrowest toward the front and shows weak beading at its margins; T.bolivaris is similar, but has stronger beading and H.megacephalus entirely lacks the beading. The parietal bone is usually limited to the roof of the braincase and does not extend to its side, as it does in most T.bolivaris. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, is large.|$|E
5|$|The skull is {{delicate}} and lightly built. The rostrum, the front {{part of the}} skull, is narrow and fairly long; it is shorter in eastern voalavo. The narrow zygomatic plate (a plate {{on the side of}} the skull) extends back to about the front of the first upper molar (M1). The zygomatic notch, a notch in the upper part of the zygomatic plate, is small. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are narrow, but as usual in nesomyines contain a relatively long jugal bone. The interorbital region (<b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes)</b> is narrow and short and lacks accessory shelves and ridges. The braincase also lacks such ridges.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> region <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> {{and bill}} {{on the side of}} a bird's head is called the lore. This region is {{sometimes}} featherless, and the skin may be tinted, as in many species of the cormorant family.|$|R
50|$|This {{species can}} be {{distinguished}} from the widespread Oriental white-eye, Zosterops palpebrosus, by its larger size, duller green back and more extensive yellow on the breast. It has a darker patch <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and <b>the</b> bill.|$|R
50|$|It {{is about}} 34 cm long. Its {{coloring}} is mostly green, with blue cheeks from around <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> to <b>the</b> neck (less on young), a yellow-orange wing speculum, a yellowish crown, and orange lores (<b>the</b> region <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and {{bill on the}} side of a bird's head).|$|R
