5|$|In {{an effort}} to prevent poisoning, often a <b>bittering</b> <b>agent</b> called denatonium benzoate, known by the trade name Bitrex, is added to {{ethylene}} glycol preparations as an adversant to prevent accidental or intentional ingestion. The <b>bittering</b> <b>agent</b> is thought to stop ingestion {{as part of the}} human defense against ingestion of harmful substances is rejection of bitter tasting substances. In the United States, eight states (Oregon, California, New Mexico, Virginia, Arizona, Maine, Tennessee, Washington) have made the addition of bittering agents to antifreeze compulsory. Three follow up studies targeting limited populations or suicidal persons to assess the efficacy of bittering agents in preventing toxicity or death have, however, shown limited benefit of bittering ethylene glycol preparations in these two populations. Specifically, Mullins finds that bittering of antifreeze does not reduce reported cases of poisoning of preschoolers in the US state of Oregon. Similarly, White found that adding bittering agents did not decrease the frequency or severity of antifreeze poisonings in {{children under the age of}} 5. Additionally, another study by White found that suicidal persons are not deterred by the bittered taste of antifreeze in their attempts to kill themselves. These studies did not focus on poisoning of domestic pets or livestock, for example, or inadvertent exposure to bittered antifreeze among a large population (of non-preschool age children).|$|E
50|$|As {{with most}} beers, ale {{typically}} has a <b>bittering</b> <b>agent</b> {{to balance the}} sweetness of the malt and act as a preservative.

40|$|Economic losses {{caused by}} herbivores {{and other species}} that inflict damage by {{browsing}} or gnawing are substantial. Because lethal approaches to damage reduction are not always practical or desirable, there {{is an increase in}} interest in the development of alternative, non-lethal technologies. Repellents may provide a feasible alternative. Here, we present recent studies of three repellent types: 1) anthranilate derivatives (e. g., methyl anthranilate), 2) predator scents (e. g., coyote urine), and 3) <b>bittering</b> <b>agents</b> (e. g., denatonium saccharide). Anthranilate derivatives and predator odors both appear to be promising repellents. Avoidance of the former substances is based on irritant volatiles, and anthranilates may be especially beneficial when the aim is to prevent gnawing damage. Predator odors may be most applicable for protection of vegetation. The effectiveness of these substances appear {{to be based on the}} presence of highly volatile, light molecular weight sulfur compounds. Unlike anthranilates or predator odors, bitter substances are largely ineffective as repellents for herbivores...|$|R
40|$|The {{bitter taste}} {{elicited}} by dairy protein hydrolysates (DPH) is a renowned issue for their acceptability by consumers and therefore incorporation into foods. The traditional method of assessment of taste in foods is by sensory analysis but {{this can be}} problematic due to the overall unpleasantness of the samples. Thus, {{there is a growing}} interest into the use of electronic tongues (e-tongues) as an alternative method to quantify the bitterness in such samples. In the present study the response of the e-tongue to the standard <b>bitter</b> <b>agent</b> caffeine and a range of both casein and whey based hydrolysates was compared to that of a trained sensory panel. Partial least square regression (PLS) was employed to compare the response of the e-tongue and the sensory panel. There was strong correlation shown between the two methods in the analysis of caffeine (R 2 of 0. 98) and DPH samples with R 2 values ranging from 0. 94 - 0. 99. This study exhibits potential for the e-tongue to be used in bitterness screening in DPHs to reduce the reliance on expensive and time consuming sensory panels...|$|R
40|$|WO 200054608 A UPAB: 20021105 NOVELTY - Method for {{treating}} and processing lupin seeds, containing alkaloids (I), oil and proteins, to recover products by targeted fractionation, comprises deoiling the comminuted seeds by immersion in a solvent, then {{treatment of the}} residue with acid to remove acid-soluble components, particularly (I). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The seeds are comminuted and/or formed into small disk-shaped flakes, using a cooled flaking roller, after preliminary breakage of the optionally dehusked seeds. The flakes are heated indirectly to eliminate most {{of the water and}} after removal of the oil, the acid-solubles are removed by aqueous extraction to leave a raffinate of reduced (I) content and an aqueous extract. USE - The method is used to produce (i) proteins, for human or animal feeding; (ii) oils and (iii) alkaloids, for use as agricultural or pharmaceutical active ingredients. The same method can be applied to other seeds such as rape, linseed, soya, groundnut, peas and field beans. ADVANTAGE - The method produces proteins (i) in unaltered (native) form, although seed enzymes are inactivated, so that development of rancidity is prevented and (ii) practically free from bitter components (mainly lipophilic (I) that are usually difficult to remove). Compared with known methods for removing <b>bitter</b> <b>agents,</b> it is technically simpler and is operated under milder conditions...|$|R
50|$|Salmon's {{first goal}} for the hop {{breeding}} program, {{as an extension of}} his research in plant pathology, was to develop disease-resistant strains. Through Salmon's career, hops were known to be a <b>bittering</b> <b>agent,</b> but research and interest in hops, particularly those originating in the Americas, was around the preservative value of the hops, the source of that value, and methods of measurement. Despite this value, brewers generally regarded American-grown hops as inferior, because of their higher levels of bitterness and particularly because of aromas considered unpleasant at the time. Salmon noted early on that English brewers were forced to blend in American-grown hops for their higher preservative value, despite this inferiority, and his breeding research expanded to include this criteria.|$|E
5000|$|Metaldehyde-containing slug baits {{should be}} used with caution, as they are toxic to dogs and cats. [...] If {{ingested}} by dogs or cats, tremors, drooling, and restlessness will proceed to seizures and death within hours to days if treatment is not started quickly. Due to this toxicity, pet owners may want to investigate alternatives which are not as toxic to pets, such as Ferric Sodium EDTA or Iron(III) phosphate. [...] The metaldehyde tablets resemble sweetmeats and do not taste bad, making accidental ingestion possible by children or even by adults unaware of their true nature. Their use was popular during the inter-war period and several cases of poisoning resulted. Baits may contain a <b>bittering</b> <b>agent</b> to prevent accidental consumption by pets or children.|$|E
5000|$|Since gas dusters {{are one of}} {{the many}} inhalants that can be easily abused, many {{manufacturers}} have added a <b>bittering</b> <b>agent</b> to deter people from inhaling the product. Because of the generic name [...] "canned air", it is mistakenly believed that the can only contains normal air or contains a less harmful substance such as nitrous oxide. However, the gases actually used are denser than air, such as difluoroethane. When inhaled, the gas displaces the oxygen in the lungs and removes carbon dioxide from the blood causing the user to suffer from hypoxia which results in the euphoric feeling abusers desire. This type of inhalant abuse can cause a plethora of negative effects including brain and nerve damage, paralysis, serious injury, or death.|$|E
40|$|Quality {{control of}} plants is {{essential}} {{and at the}} same time very challenging. In this thesis, studies involving quality issues of two plants used in the production of two popular beverages, hops (in beer) and Ilex paraguariensis (yerba mate) were undertaken. Hops are used as <b>bittering</b> <b>agents</b> and to increase foam stability in beer brewing. The compounds responsible for this are cis/trans isohumulones, produced by isomerisation of the 3 α-acids present in hops. To evaluate their individual effect, they had to be obtained in gram-scale amounts. For this, 3 methods based on the use of CPC (centrifugal partition chromatography) in combination with selective precipitation methods (DCHA) of trans-isomers were developed. Trans-isohumulones were found to precipitate selectively with β-cyclodextrin. Yerba mate is a popular tea-like beverage consumed in S America made from the leaves of Ilex paraguariensis, a species unique for its high caffeine content. The detection of adulterants i. e., cogeneric authoctonous Ilex species is vital for its quality control. The metabolomic profile of 11 Ilex species was determined, resulting in the clear separation of all species. Additionally, arbutin was detected (0. 5 - 10 % dw) in several of the tested species but not in I. paraguariensis, though its presence had not been formerly reported. Promotors: R. Verpoorte, P. G.

40|$|AbstractAloe vera (L.) Burm. f., Xanthorrhoeaceae, a succulent, {{produces}} barbaloin, a bioactive compounds used {{in various}} pharmaceutical products. Extracts prepared from the leaves {{have been widely}} used as <b>bittering</b> <b>agents,</b> taste modifiers and also as cathartic agent against severe constipation. Barbaloin is reported for its anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antiviral and anticancer activities and these properties are mostly mediated by its antioxidative capacity. Presently, a study has been conducted on the comparative High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography analysis of barbaloin from the dried leaf skin powder of in vivo and in vitro grown A. vera. Shoot tips of A. vera were cultured in Murashige and Skoog media supplemented with different combination of 6 -benzylaminopurine and 1 -naphthaleneacetic acid. [Best multiplication response was noted in benzylaminopurine (2. 0 mg/l) + 1 -naphthaleneacetic acid (0. 1 mg/l) supplemented Murashige and Skoog media]. The quantitative determination of barbaloin was performed on silica gel 60 F 254 HPTLC plates as stationary phase. The linear ascending development was carried out in a twin trough glass chamber saturated with a mobile phase consisting of ethyl acetate: methanol: water (100 : 16. 5 : 13. 5) at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C). CAMAG Thin Layer Chromatography scanner- 3 equipped with CATS software (version: 1. 4. 4. 6337) was used for spectrodensitometric scanning and analysis in the ultraviolet region at λ= 366 nm. The method was validated for linearity, precision and accuracy. Correlation coefficient, limit of detection, limit of quantification as well as recovery values were found to be satisfactory. Out of the five populations studied, the leaf skin of A. vera collected from Jodhpur (Rajasthan, India) and raised in vitro was found to contain higher amount of barbaloin (2. 78 %) when compared to its naturally growing counterparts (2. 46 %) and other plant populations...|$|R
