Calcareous grassland is species rich, typified by blue moor-grass, wild-mountain thyme, lady's bedstraw, fairy flax and lady's-mantle as well as fescue grasses, sweet vernal grass, <b>bent</b> <b>grass,</b> crested dog's-tail grass, carnation sedge Cyperaceae and devil's-bit scabious on the thin layer of soil which covers the limestone rock. Within this type of habitat, limestone pavement can also often be found, which can promote an even greater diversity of species.|$|E
25|$|In its 2015–16 {{listing of}} the best golf courses by state, Golf Digest ranked Oak Tree National #51 in their Americas 100 Greatest Golf Courses. Also, they ranked it second {{in the state of}} Oklahoma. The course was {{redesigned}} by Pete Dye in 2002. The course measures 7,412 yards from the tournament tees and 6,873 yards from the championship tees. However, for the 2006 Senior PGA Championship, the course played to 7,102 yards. Oak Tree has <b>Bent</b> <b>grass</b> for the greens, and Bermuda grass for the fairways. Water comes into play on 13 of the 18 holes.

50|$|It {{is found}} growing in neutral to acidic soils. It {{has a very}} fine texture and like most <b>bent</b> <b>grasses</b> grows very dense. Although this species is used on golf courses, {{providing}} {{some of the best}} ball playing surfaces in the world, it also produces a spectacular visual appearance when maintained properly. It provides an excellent home lawn but is not tolerant of heavy use. Colonial bent is fairly easy to grow from seeds and fertilization of the lawn is not as intense. This grass also takes longer to establish than creeping bent. However it does not require the intense maintenance.|$|R
60|$|The later summer sunbeams lay on {{an expanse}} of {{slightly}} broken ground where purple and crimson heather were relieved by the golden blossoms of the dwarf gorse, interspersed with white stars of stitch-wort. Here and there, on the slopes, grew stunted oaks and hollies, whose polished leaves gleamed white with {{the reflection of the}} light; but there was not a trace of human habitation save a track, as if trodden by horses' feet, clear of the furze and heath, and bordered by soft <b>bent</b> <b>grass,</b> beginning to grow brown.|$|E
60|$|At {{daylight}} I {{went back}} to the spot. I found without trouble where the fawn had fallen; the moss told mutely of his struggle; and a stain or two showed where Mooween grabbed him. The rest was a plain trail of crushed moss and <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> and stained leaves, and a tuft of soft hair here and there on the jagged ends of knots in the old windfalls. So the trail hurried up the hill into a wild, rough country where it was of no use to follow.|$|E

Another dreary stage among the now divided {{branches}} of the Brenta, forming irregular and half-stagnant canals; with one or two more villas {{on the other side of}} them, but these of the old Venetian type, which we may have recognised before at Padua, and sinking fast into utter ruin, black, and rent, and lonely, set close to the edge of the dull water, with what were once small gardens beside them, kneaded into mud, and with blighted fragments of gnarled hedges and broken stakes for their fencing; and here and there a few fragments of marble steps, which have once given them graceful access from the water's edge, now settling into the mud in broken joints, all aslope, and slippery with green weed. At last the road turns sharply to the north, and there is an open space, covered with <b>bent</b> <b>grass,</b> on the right of it: but do not look that way.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Documentation {{is needed}} to {{characterize}} the Stafford Township landfill restoration (Figure 1). The landfill received a series of closure treatments finalized by capping and seeding of the soils {{with a mixture of}} various grasses. The seeding occurred in late 2007 and early 2008. The initial mixture included three native warm season species. The mixture included switch grass (Panicum virgatum), Indian grass (Sorgastrum nutans) and little blue stem (Schizachyrium scoparium). The mixture was divided between the species, using a combination of 45 % switch grass, 35 % little blue stem and 20 % Indian grass. This mixture was drilled into the prepared surface substrate. A second separate planting involving common drought tolerant soil erosion control grasses occurred on the same landfill cap. Ryegrass, fescues and <b>bent</b> <b>grasses</b> were part of this second planting. Today, the landfill cap is in the initial stages of grass cover recovery...|$|R
60|$|Here {{there was}} just enough life and {{adventure}} to charm them, as they gaily trod the path, winding picturesquely beside the dashing, dancing, foaming stream, now between bare salient bluffs of dark rock, now between glades of verdant thicket, or bold shouldering slopes of purple heath and soft <b>bent</b> <b>grass.</b> They were constantly crying out with delight, as they bounded from one point of view to another, sometimes climbing among loose stones, leading between ferns and hazel stems to a well-planted hermitage, sometimes springing across the streamlet upon stepping-stones. At {{the end of the}} wood another lodge-gate brought them beyond the private grounds, that showed care, even in their rusticity, and they came out on the open hill-side in true mountain air, soft turf beneath their feet, the stream rushing away {{at the bottom of the}} slope, and the view closed in with blue mountains, on which the clouds marked purple shadows. This was freedom! this was enjoyment! this was worth the journey! and Cilla's elastic feet sprang along as if she had been a young kid. How much was delight in the scenery, how much in the scramble, need not be analyzed.|$|E
60|$|The {{shore in}} {{face of these}} islets is {{altogether}} waste. Here is no dwelling of man, and scarce any passage, or at most of vagabond children running at their play. Gillane is a small place {{on the far side}} of the Ness, the folk of Dirleton go to their business in the inland fields, and those of North Berwick straight to the sea-fishing from their haven; so that few parts of the coast are lonelier. But I mind, as we crawled upon our bellies into that multiplicity of heights and hollows, keeping a bright eye upon all sides, and our hearts hammering at our ribs, there was such a shining of the sun and the sea, such a stir of the wind in the <b>bent</b> <b>grass,</b> and such a bustle of down-popping rabbits and up-flying gulls, that the desert seemed to me like a place alive. No doubt it was in all ways well chosen for a secret embarcation, if the secret had been kept; and even now that it was out, and the place watched, we were able to creep unperceived to the front of the sandhills, where they look down immediately on the beach and sea.|$|E
60|$|These {{thoughts}} {{brought me}} {{to the head of the}} beach. I cast a look behind, the boat was nearing the brig, and Alan flew his handkerchief for a farewell, which I replied to with the waving of my hand. But Alan himself was shrunk to a small thing in my view, alongside of this pass that lay in front of me. I set my hat hard on my head, clenched my teeth, and went right before me up the face of the sand-wreath. It made a hard climb, being steep, and the sand like water underfoot. But I caught hold at last by the long <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> on the brae-top, and pulled myself to a good footing. The same moment men stirred and stood up here and there, six or seven of them, ragged-like knaves, each with a dagger in his hand. The fair truth is, I shut my eyes and prayed. When I opened them again, the rogues were crept the least thing nearer without speech or hurry. Every eye was upon mine, which struck me with a strange sensation of their brightness, and of the fear with which they continued to approach me. I held out my hands empty: whereupon one asked, with a strong Highland brogue, if I surrendered.|$|E

6000|$|Presently I {{crossed a}} fresh bear track, so fresh that I {{could see the}} {{dampness}} of the dark earth, the rolling of little particles, the springing erect of <b>bent</b> <b>grasses.</b> In some places big sections of earth, a yard wide had slipped under the feet of this particular bear. He appeared to be working down. Right then I wanted to go up! But I could not climb out there. I had to go down. Soon I was under low-spreading, dense spruces, and I had to hold on desperately to keep from sliding. All the time naturally I kept a keen lookout for a bear. Every stone and tree trunk resembled a bear. I decided if I met a grizzly that I would not annoy him on that slope. I would say: [...] "Nice bear, I won't hurt you!" [...] Still the situation {{had some kind of}} charm. But to claim I was not frightened would not be strictly truthful. I slid over the trail of that bear into the trail of another one, and under the last big spruce on that part of the slope I found a hollow nest of pine needles and leaves, and if that bed was not still warm then my imagination lent considerable to the moment.|$|R

60|$|A roar, {{resembling}} {{an approaching}} storm at sea, came on puffs of wind, as the horses got into their stride. Long streaks of dust whipped up in different places; the silver-white <b>grass</b> <b>bent</b> to the ground; round bunches of sage went rolling before us. The puffs grew longer, steadier, harder. Then a shrieking blast howled on our trail, seeming to swoop {{down on us}} with a yellow, blinding pall. I shut my eyes and covered my face with a handkerchief.

60|$|One {{of those}} {{who had been in the}} midst of the pageant, and had {{returned}} unscathed, was Blind Hal of Bethnal Green. Many a coin had gone into his scrip--uncontested king of the beggars as he was; many a savoury morsel had been conveyed to him and his child by his admiring brethren of the wallet; with many a gibing scoff had he driven from the field presuming mendicants, not of his own fraternity; and with half-bitter, half-amused remarks, had he listened to the rapturous descriptions of the splendours of king, queen, and their noble suite. And pretty Bessee had clung fast to his hand, and discreetly guided him through every maze of the crowd, with the strange dexterity of a child bred up in throngs. And now tired out with the long-continued festivities, the beggar sat in front of his hut, basking in the sun, and more than half asleep; while Bessee, her lap full of heather-blossoms and long <b>bents</b> of <b>grass,</b> was endeavouring to weave herself chains, bracelets, and coronals, in imitation of those which had recently dazzled her eyes.|$|R
