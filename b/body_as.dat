5|$|A {{black hole}} is {{a region of}} spacetime exhibiting such strong {{gravitational}} effects that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black <b>body,</b> <b>as</b> it reflects no light.|$|E
5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} (collapsed lung) is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall. The lung cannot expand against the air pressure inside the pleural space. An easy to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural space from outside the <b>body,</b> <b>as</b> occurs with puncture to the chest wall. Similarly, a scuba diver ascending while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the pleural space.|$|E

This, in turn, was disbanded in 1916 following disagreements over World War I. Although the organisation reformed in 1923 as the Labour and Socialist International, supporters of the October Revolution and the Bolsheviks had already set up the Communist International (Comintern), which they regarded as the Third International. This was organised on a democratic centralist basis, with component parties required to fight for policies adopted by the <b>body</b> <b>as</b> a whole.|$|E

Females lay clutches of eggs with an incubation period of some 80 to 90 days. Like most snakes female mambas are both oviparous and iteroparous. Egg-laying typically occurs during the middle of summer and egg clutches range from 6 to 17 eggs.|$|E
5|$|Descartes' famous {{argument}} for this position {{can be summarized}} as follows: Seth has a clear and distinct idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be {{measured in terms of}} length, weight, height, and so on). He also has a clear and distinct idea of his <b>body</b> <b>as</b> something that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to think. It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties.|$|E
5|$|Dimetrodon was {{probably}} one of the apex predators of the Cisuralian ecosystems, feeding on fish and tetrapods, including reptiles and amphibians. Smaller Dimetrodon species may have had different ecological roles. The sail of Dimetrodon may have been used to stabilize its spine or to heat and cool its <b>body</b> <b>as</b> a form of thermoregulation. Some recent studies argue that the sail would have been ineffective at removing heat from the body, and was most likely used in courtship display.|$|E

The Grande Loge de France formed under the Grand Mastership of the Duke of Clermont, who {{exercised}} only nominal authority.

5|$|In general relativity, the apsides of any orbit (the {{point of}} the {{orbiting}} body's closest approach to the system's center of mass) will precess—the orbit is not an ellipse, but akin to an ellipse that rotates on its focus, resulting in a rose curve-like shape (see image). Einstein first derived this result by using an approximate metric representing the Newtonian limit and treating the orbiting <b>body</b> <b>as</b> a test particle. For him, {{the fact that his}} theory gave a straightforward explanation of Mercury's anomalous perihelion shift, discovered earlier by Urbain Le Verrier in 1859, was important evidence that he had at last identified the correct form of the gravitational field equations.|$|E
