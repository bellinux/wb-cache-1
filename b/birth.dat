5|$|About 222million {{women who}} want to avoid {{pregnancy}} in developing countries are not using a modern <b>birth</b> control method. <b>Birth</b> control use in developing countries has decreased the number of deaths during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for <b>birth</b> control were met. By lengthening the time between pregnancies, <b>birth</b> control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children. In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access to <b>birth</b> control. <b>Birth</b> control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.|$|E

5|$|<b>Birth</b> control {{practices}} were generally adopted earlier in Europe {{than in the}} United States. Knowlton's book was reprinted in 1877 in England by Charles Bradlaugh and Annie Besant, {{with the goal of}} challenging Britain's obscenity laws. They were arrested (and later acquitted) but the publicity of their trial contributed to the formation, in 1877, of the Malthusian League– the world's first <b>birth</b> control advocacy group– which sought to limit population growth to avoid Thomas Malthus's dire predictions of exponential population growth leading to worldwide poverty and famine. By 1930, similar societies had been established in nearly all European countries, and <b>birth</b> control began to find acceptance in most Western European countries, except Catholic Ireland, Spain, and France. As the <b>birth</b> control societies spread across Europe, so did <b>birth</b> control clinics. The first <b>birth</b> control clinic in the world was established in the Netherlands in 1882, run by the Netherlands' first female physician, Aletta Jacobs. The first <b>birth</b> control clinic in England was established in 1921 by Marie Stopes, in London.|$|E
5|$|<b>Birth</b> control, {{also known}} as {{contraception}} and fertility control, is a method or device used to prevent pregnancy. <b>Birth</b> control has been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods of <b>birth</b> control only became available in the 20th century. Planning, making available, and using <b>birth</b> control is called family planning. Some cultures limit or discourage access to <b>birth</b> control because they consider it to be morally, religiously, or politically undesirable.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reform}} period, the Communist regime in China {{regulated}} <b>birth</b> control. The government shaped policies {{with the intention}} to develop population science “through selective absorption of Western science and technology.” In 1979, the Planned <b>Birth</b> Policy was implemented. The Chinese government only allowed one child per Han family, with more children allowed to non-Han families. Since this planned <b>birth</b> policy was implemented based on local laws rather than on a national population law, the level of <b>birth</b> restriction differed in urban and rural areas. In families reliant on farming for income, the household is the fundamental unit of production, so many rural families would rather pay the hefty fines for excess <b>birth.</b>|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{evaluated}} {{the increase in}} risk of multiple <b>births</b> associated with ovulation induction and calculated the proportion of multiple <b>births</b> attributable to this treatment. METHODS: Cases were 350 multiple <b>births</b> and controls were 737 single <b>births</b> enrolled from April 1993 to March 1994 in the Mercurio Project, an investigation of reproductive outcomes in Italy. RESULTS: Ovulation induction was used in 45 case <b>births</b> (12. 9 %) and 24 control <b>births</b> (3. 3 %); the adjusted odds ratio was 4. 1 (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 2. 4, 6. 9). The odds ratio for triplet or higher order <b>births</b> was 72. 2 (95 % CI = 25. 7, 202. 8). When unlike-sexed multiple <b>births</b> were considered, the odds ratio increased for twin <b>births,</b> but not for triplet or higher <b>births.</b> The highest odds ratios were found when ovulation induction was used with assisted reproduction. The proportion of multiple <b>births</b> attributable to ovulation induction was 9. 7 % overall, 5. 4 % for twin <b>births,</b> and 69. 8 % for triplet or higher <b>births.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Ovulation induction {{increases the risk of}} multiple <b>births</b> and has been responsible for the rise in the rate of triplet or higher order <b>births</b> in Italy in the last decade. Its indiscriminate and improper use should be avoided...|$|R

5|$|For {{individuals}} with specific health problems, {{certain forms of}} <b>birth</b> control may require further investigations. For women who are otherwise healthy, many methods of <b>birth</b> control should not require a medical exam—including <b>birth</b> control pills, injectable or implantable <b>birth</b> control, and condoms. For example, a pelvic exam, breast exam, or blood test before starting <b>birth</b> control pills {{does not appear to}} affect outcomes. In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a detailed list of medical eligibility criteria for each type of <b>birth</b> control.|$|E
5|$|In teenagers, pregnancies are {{at greater}} risk of poor outcomes. Comprehensive sex {{education}} and access to <b>birth</b> control decreases the rate of unwanted pregnancies in this age group. While all forms of <b>birth</b> control can generally be used by young people, long-acting reversible <b>birth</b> control such as implants, IUDs, or vaginal rings are more successful in reducing rates of teenage pregnancy. After the delivery of a child, a woman who is not exclusively breastfeeding may become pregnant again after as few as four to six weeks. Some methods of <b>birth</b> control can be started immediately following the <b>birth,</b> while others require a delay of up to six months. In women who are breastfeeding, progestin-only methods are preferred over combined oral <b>birth</b> control pills. In women who have reached menopause, it is recommended that <b>birth</b> control be continued for one year after the last period.|$|E

40|$|Numbers of {{caesarean}} sections, epidurals, {{and other}} forms of medical interventions for <b>birthing</b> are rising in the United States healthcare industry. One possible reason is the medicalization of <b>birthing</b> and labor techniques. Another potential reason is the increasing distinction between laboring in a hospital versus laboring in the home or an independent <b>birthing</b> center. The dominance of the medical model of <b>birthing</b> has led to social constructions of <b>birthing</b> that divide women by diagnosis, into either high-risk or low-risk prenatal categories, further perpetuating the medical model’s power to marginalize the midwifery model. Forty percent of U. S. <b>births</b> are financed by Medicaid insurance. Because Medicaid insurance is based on the technocratic medical model, <b>birthing</b> providers that accept Medicaid insurance may be pressured, directly and indirectly, to adopt the medical model as the most appropriate <b>birthing</b> option, decentering the midwifery model. Inevitably, this potentially shifts <b>birthing</b> options and experiences for low-income women in the U. S. In order to understand how low-income women experience <b>birthing</b> in U. S <b>birthing</b> institutions, we first need {{to take a closer look}} at how <b>birthing</b> facilities socially construct <b>birthing.</b> Among many areas of influence for the social construction of <b>birthing,</b> website content has been neglected as a form of primary data. Using content analysis, this study investigates how web content aids in the social stock of knowledge on labor and delivery. Analyzing the websites of three <b>birthing</b> centers and two public hospitals that accept Medicaid insurance in Miami, Florida, this study’s findings indicate that the language used on <b>birthing</b> center websites aligns with the midwifery model, but reverts to the medical model used by hospitals, in language and policy, when discussing cases of emergency <b>birthing.</b> The public hospital websites, meanwhile, appropriate the language and procedures of the midwifery model without providing the practical benefits of natural <b>birthing.</b> Findings in this study also capture a snapshot of <b>birthing</b> models used by providers in Miami, Florida ahead of its 2016 transition from the Florida Medicaid system to the Federally-Funded Marketplace, as per the Affordable Care Act of 2009. By assessing how <b>birthing</b> providers socially construct <b>birthing,</b> we could reduce the underrepresentation of natural <b>birthing,</b> exposing low-income women to more balanced depictions of both the medical and midwifery models of <b>birthing,</b> possibly reducing negative socio-emotional outcomes during <b>birthing,</b> postpartum depression and maternity-mortality rates among the poor...|$|R

5|$|The most {{effective}} methods of <b>birth</b> control are sterilization {{by means of}} vasectomy in males and tubal ligation in females, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and implantable <b>birth</b> control. This {{is followed by a}} number of hormone-based methods including oral pills, patches, vaginal rings, and injections. Less effective methods include physical barriers such as condoms, diaphragms and <b>birth</b> control sponges and fertility awareness methods. The least effective methods are spermicides and withdrawal by the male before ejaculation. Sterilization, while highly effective, is not usually reversible; all other methods are reversible, most immediately upon stopping them. Safe sex practices, such as with the use of male or female condoms, can also help prevent sexually transmitted infections. Other methods of <b>birth</b> control do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. Emergency <b>birth</b> control can prevent pregnancy if taken within the 72 to 120 hours after unprotected sex. Some argue not having sex as a form of <b>birth</b> control, but abstinence-only sex education may increase teenage pregnancies if offered without <b>birth</b> control education, due to non-compliance.|$|E
