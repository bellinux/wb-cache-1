The results show that <b>backgrounding</b> systems beginning in the fall and ending from April to late August are associated with higher expected returns relative to summer <b>backgrounding.</b> However, winter <b>backgrounding</b> is associated with greater overall risk relative to summer <b>backgrounding.</b> Stochastic dominance analysis indicated that slightly risk averse backgrounders prefer both winter and summer baskgrounding but summer <b>backgrounding</b> is preferred by strongly risk averse decision makers.

40|$|June-born cattle <b>backgrounded</b> at a {{lower rate}} during the winter were unable to fully {{compensate}} during sum¬mer grazing for restricted gain during <b>backgrounding.</b> Increased gain during <b>backgrounding</b> resulted in cattle being heavier for all market periods. The higher cost associated with increased gain was offset by heavier sale weights.

40|$|A {{class of}} {{potential}} <b>backgrounds</b> for Higgs boson searches in the h→WW (∗) → `ν `′ν channel {{at both the}} Tevatron and Large Hadron Collider is presented. <b>Backgrounds</b> from Wγ production with external conversion of the on-shell photon in detector ma-terial to an asymmetric electron–positron pair, γ → e(e), with loss of the trailing electron or positron has been treated adequately in Higgs searches. Here we consider analogous <b>backgrounds</b> from Wγ ∗ production with internal conversion of the off-shell photon in vacuum to an asymmetric lepton–anti-lepton pair γ ∗ → `(`). While the for-mer process yields almost entirely electrons or positrons, the latter can give electron, positron, muon, and anti-muon <b>backgrounds</b> in roughly equal amounts. We estimate that asymmetric internal conversion <b>backgrounds</b> are comparable to the Higgs boson signal in the standard signal region of phase space. These processes also represent potential <b>backgrounds</b> for new physics searches in same-sign di-lepton channels.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the geometry of}} all type II common sector <b>backgrounds</b> with two supersymmetries. In particular, we determine the spacetime geometry of those supersymmetric <b>backgrounds</b> for which each copy of the Killing spinor equations admits a Killing spinor. The stability subgroups of both Killing spinors are Spin(7) ^ 8, SU(4) ^ 8 and G_ 2 for IIB <b>backgrounds,</b> and Spin(7), SU(4) and G_ 2 ^ 8 for IIA <b>backgrounds.</b> We show that the spacetime of <b>backgrounds</b> with spinors that have stability subgroup K^ 8 is a pp-wave propagating in an eight-dimensional manifold with a K-structure. The spacetime of <b>backgrounds</b> with K-invariant Killing spinors is a fibre bundle with fibre spanned by the orbits of two commuting null Killing vector fields and base space an eight-dimensional manifold which admits a K-structure. Type II T-duality interchanges the <b>backgrounds</b> with K- and K^ 8 -invariant Killing spinors. We show that the geometries of the base space of the fibre bundle and the corresponding space in which the pp-wave propagates are the same. The conformal symmetry of the world-sheet action of type II strings propagating in these N= 2 <b>backgrounds</b> can always be fixed in the light-cone gauge. Comment: 30 page...|$|R
