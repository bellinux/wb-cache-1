5000|$|Seeing {{little sign}} of an {{increase}} in production capacity at Ashford, Maunsell decided to construct the prototype N1 locomotive from parts intended for use on the next N class locomotive in the <b>batch,</b> <b>No.</b> 822. The outside cylinders were exchanged for the N1 type, which had been machined at the GWR's Swindon railway works following casting at Ashford to quicken construction once the N class frames were modified to accept the new design of cylinder block. This produced a robust chassis capable of supporting both sets of Walschaerts and the Holcroft conjugated valve gear. The latter was provided with grease-gun lubrication points to ease maintenance.|$|E
5000|$|The company {{introduced}} the Willett Pot Still Reserve bourbon brand in 2008. It was originally a single barrel bourbon.Each bottle was sealed with a label identifying the individual aging barrel, {{the number of}} the bottle within the series of bottles for that barrel, and the total number of bottles from the barrel (example: [...] "Bottle No. 116 of 242 from Single Barrel 149"). However, {{at some point in time}} roughly around 2015, it stopped being a single barrel brand and became a small batch brand instead. The bottles as still sealed with a paper labeling strip, but they no longer carry bottle numbers (example: [...] "Small Batch Bourbon made in Kentucky - <b>Batch</b> <b>No.</b> 16A3"). For its definition of the term [...] "small batch", the company said in 2011 that it used at most 12 barrels per batch for its [...] "small batch" [...] brands.|$|E
5000|$|The {{decision}} {{to preserve a}} member of the class was made in November 1960. It was first intended to preserve the King Arthur class doyen No. 453 King Arthur, and it was stored for a time after withdrawal in 1961 pending restoration to museum condition. However, it was decided to restore the preserved locomotive to as-built condition, and the lack of a suitable Drummond [...] "watercart" [...] tender precluded this consideration. No. 453 was subsequently scrapped and it was decided to preserve one of the North British-built <b>batch,</b> <b>No.</b> 30777 Sir Lamiel, withdrawn in October 1961, instead. Sir Lamiel was named after a character in Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, Sir Lamiel of Cardiff. This locomotive was restored to Maunsell livery as No. E777, and became part of the National Collection. It was restored to the later British Railways livery in 2003, and No. 30777 can be seen at the Great Central Railway and on the railway network hauling mainline railtours as of 2010.|$|E

These withdrawals meant that by the New Year of 1964, there were only 22 of the class remaining. Nos. 46229, 46233 and 46236 followed in early 1964, although two of this group - No. 46229 Duchess of Hamilton and No. 46233 Duchess of Sutherland - were destined for preservation.|$|R

Originally they were allocated to the Way and Works Branch for construction work, but later saw some use by the Mechanical Branch as shunting engines for hire to private industries whose own engines were under repair. The three engines were transferred to the Mechanical Branch in 1951 and received the class letter 'Y' in 1952. During their service life with the NZR, the locomotives retained their original PWD numbers.|$|R

5|$|Black was the {{overriding}} colour for this period, with one exception. Streamlined locomotives Nos. 6245–6248 were outshopped at Crewe in 1943 painted plain black. The following two <b>batches,</b> <b>Nos.</b> 6249–6255, constructed without streamlining, were also painted unlined black; the lettering and numerals {{on all these}} locomotives was in serif style coloured yellow with red shading. From 1946 onwards de-streamlined locomotives were mostly repainted in black with LMS-style lining. The lining comprised a broad maroon centre with fine straw yellow edging. Lettering and numbers were in a sans-serif Grotesque font, coloured yellow with an inner maroon line. By the end of 1947, 29 of the 37 locomotives were painted thus.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{secretion}} of melatonin (MT) {{is obviously}} {{different in the}} younger and the senior sectors of the population, and the maximum plasma concentration of seniors is only half {{of that in the}} younger population group. If exogenous MT can be supplied to senior citizens based on the secretion rate and amount of endogenous MT in the younger population by a bio-mimetic drug delivery system (DDS), an improved therapeutic effect and reduced side effects can be expected. Based upon this hypothesis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of MT, namely, the absorption rate constant (ka), the elimination rate constant (ke), and the ratio of absorption rate (F) to the apparent volume of distribution (V) were obtained by a residual method depending on the plasma concentration curve of immediate release preparations in the healthy younger population. The dose-division method was applied to calculate the cumulative release profiles of MT achieved by oral administration of a controlled release drug delivery system (DDS) to generate plasma MT profiles similar to the physiological level-time profiles. The in vivo release of MT deduced from the healthy younger population physiological MT profiles as the pharmacokinetic output of the bio-mimetic DDS showed a two-phase profile with two different zero order release rates, namely, 4. 919 μg/h during 0 – 4 h (r= 0. 9992), and 11. 097 μg/h during 4 – 12 h (r= 0. 9886), respectively. Since the osmotic pump type of DDS generally exhibits a good correlation between in vivo and in vitro release behaviors, an osmotic pump controlled delivery system was designed in combination with dry coating technology targeting on the cumulative release characteristics to mimic the physiological MT profiles in the healthy younger population. The high similarity between the experimental drug release profiles and the theoretical profiles (similarity factor f 2 > 50) and the high correlation between the predicted plasma concentration profiles and the theoretical plasma concentration profiles (r= 0. 9366, 0. 9163, 0. 9264) indicated that a prototype bio-mimetic drug delivery system of MT was established. The similarity factors between the experimental drug release profiles and the theoretical release profile were all larger than 50 both in periods of 0 – 4 h and 4 – 12 h, namely, 68. 8 and 57. 3 for the first batch (<b>Batch</b> <b>No.</b> 20131031), 76. 7 and 50. 2 for the second batch (<b>Batch</b> <b>No.</b> 20131101), and 73. 7 and 51. 1 for the third batch (<b>Batch</b> <b>No.</b> 20131126), respectively. The correlation coefficients between the predicted plasma concentration profiles based on the release profiles of the bio-mimetic DDS and physiological profiles were 0. 9366 (<b>Batch</b> <b>No.</b> 20131031), 0. 9163 (<b>Batch</b> <b>No.</b> 20131101), 0. 9264 (<b>Batch</b> <b>No.</b> 20131126), respectively. Since the pharmacokinetic profile of MT in any kind of animal differs markedly from that of human beings, it is impossible to test the bio-mimetic DDS in animals directly. Therefore, the predicted pharmacokinetic profile based upon the in vitro release kinetics is an acceptable surrogate for the conventional animal test. In this research, a bio-mimetic DDS for replacement of MT was designed with in silico evaluation...|$|E
