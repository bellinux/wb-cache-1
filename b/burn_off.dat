25|$|The welder must add {{the filler}} rod to the molten puddle. The welder must also keep the filler metal {{in the hot}} outer flame zone when not adding it to the puddle to protect filler metal from oxidation. Do not let the welding flame <b>burn</b> <b>off</b> the filler metal. The metal will not wet into the base metal and will look {{like a series of}} cold dots on the base metal. There is very little {{strength}} in a cold weld. When the filler metal is properly added to the molten puddle, the resulting weld will be stronger than the original base metal.|$|E
25|$|Pseudotsuga macrocarpa, {{has several}} {{features}} to tolerate and survive wildfire, notably the very thick bark, {{and the presence}} of numerous adventitious buds on the upper side of the branches; this enables the trees to survive even crown fires which <b>burn</b> <b>off</b> all the branchlets, the apparently dead trees becoming green again the following spring. Wildfire frequencies in the chaparral habitats in which it often grows typically range from 15-50 year intervals. Bigcone Douglas-fir is closely associated with canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis) and often establishes itself in its shade; after about 50 years, it emerges above the oak canopy.|$|E

25|$|Gassing is {{the process}} of passing yarn, as {{distinct}} from fabric very rapidly through a series of Bunsen gas flames in a gassing frame, in order to <b>burn</b> <b>off</b> the projecting fibres and make the thread round and smooth and also brighter. Only the better qualities of yarn are gassed, such as that used for voiles, poplins, venetians, gabardines, many Egyptian qualities, etc. There is a loss of weight in gassing, which varies' about 5 to 8 per cent., so that if a 2/60's yarn is required 2/56's would be used. The gassed yarn is darker in shade afterwards, but should not be scorched.|$|E
25|$|On June 13, 2012, Dallas, a {{continuation}} of the 1978 original series premiered on the cable network, TNT. The revived series, which was canceled after three seasons in 2014, delivered solid ratings for the channel. In 2012, Nick at Nite debuted a primetime soap opera, Hollywood Heights, which aired episodes five nights a week (on Monday through Fridays) {{in a manner similar to}} a daytime soap opera, instead of the once-a-week episode output common of other primetime soaps. The series, which was an adaptation of the Mexican telenovela Alcanzar una estrella, suffered from low ratings (generally receiving less than one million viewers) and was later moved to sister cable channel TeenNick halfway through its run to <b>burn</b> <b>off</b> the remaining episodes.|$|E

Passengers were able to watch their own coverage live from the satellite broadcast on JetBlue in-flight TV seat displays of their plane as it made an emergency landing with the front landing gear visibly becoming damaged. Because JetBlue did not serve LAX at the time, the aircraft was evaluated and repaired at a Continental Airlines hangar.|$|E

25|$|Flaming {{is done to}} {{loops and}} straight-wires in {{microbiology}} labs. Leaving the loop in the flame of a Bunsen burner or alcohol lamp until it glows red ensures that any infectious agent is inactivated. This is commonly used for small metal or glass objects, but not for large objects (see Incineration below). However, during the initial heating infectious material may be sprayed from the wire surface before it is killed, contaminating nearby surfaces and objects. Therefore, special heaters have been developed that surround the inoculating loop with a heated cage, ensuring that such sprayed material does not further contaminate the area. Another problem is that gas flames may leave carbon or other residues on the object if the object is not heated enough. A variation on flaming is to dip the object in 70% or higher ethanol, then briefly touch the object to a Bunsen burner flame. The ethanol will ignite and <b>burn</b> <b>off</b> rapidly, leaving less residue than a gas flame.|$|E
25|$|Fusion {{splicing}} is {{done with}} a specialized instrument. The fiber ends are first stripped of their protective polymer coating (as well as the more sturdy outer jacket, if present). The ends are cleaved (cut) with a precision cleaver to make them perpendicular, and are placed into special holders in the fusion splicer. The splice is usually inspected via a magnified viewing screen to check the cleaves {{before and after the}} splice. The splicer uses small motors to align the end faces together, and emits a small spark between electrodes at the gap to <b>burn</b> <b>off</b> dust and moisture. Then the splicer generates a larger spark that raises the temperature above the melting point of the glass, fusing the ends together permanently. The location and energy of the spark is carefully controlled so that the molten core and cladding do not mix, and this minimizes optical loss. A splice loss estimate is measured by the splicer, by directing light through the cladding on one side and measuring the light leaking from the cladding on the other side. A splice loss under 0.1dB is typical. The complexity of this process makes fiber splicing much more difficult than splicing copper wire.|$|E

500|$|Several small {{passerine}} species survive freezing winter nights by inducing a lower {{metabolic rate}} and hypothermia, of {{a maximum of}} [...] below normal body temperature, {{in order to reduce}} energy consumption overnight. However, in freezing conditions, it may be that for very small birds, including the tiny goldcrest, the energy economies of induced hypothermia may be insufficient to counterbalance the negative effects of hypothermia including the energy required to raise body temperature back to normal at dawn. Observations of five well-fed birds suggest that they maintain normal body temperatures during cold nights by metabolising fat laid down during the day, and that they actually use behavioural thermoregulation strategies, such as collective roosting in dense foliage or snow holes to survive winter nights. Two birds roosting together reduce their heat loss by a quarter, and three birds by a third. During an 18‑hour winter night, with temperatures as low as [...] in the north of its range, goldcrests huddled together can each <b>burn</b> <b>off</b> fat equivalent to 20% of body weight to keep warm.|$|E

[...] After lunch, the submarine was to display its operational abilities and then return the DVs to Pearl Harbor for a reception that was scheduled to begin at 14:30. [...] The lunch service ran late, and other Greeneville officers repeatedly reminded Waddle that the submarine needed to begin its demonstration maneuvers or it would be late back to port.

500|$|Since {{the vessel}} {{was no longer}} {{seaworthy}} and could not move under its own power, even if freed from the beach, {{the focus of the}} operation changed. Oil from the ship's fuel tanks continued to pose an environmental hazard, a situation exacerbated by both the ship's structural failure and continuing pounding from the surf. In order to mitigate the situation, the Unified Command decided to set the fuel tanks on fire in order to <b>burn</b> <b>off</b> the oil. The first attempt was made on February 10. Napalm and other incendiary devices were used to ignite the fuel, but only one of the diesel tanks was burned effectively. A second attempt was made on February 11 when US Navy explosive experts placed 39 shaped charges to breach the top of the fuel tanks from within the cargo holds. 2,280liters of napalm and nearly 180kg of plastic explosives were also used to ignite the fuel on board. The ship burned for approximately 33hours. Additional smaller-scale attempts were made to burn more oil over the next two days, with limited success. The total amount of oil that was burned is estimated to be between [...] The structural stress caused by the fire, combined with continued severe weather, caused the vessel to break into two sections around midnight on February 11.|$|E
