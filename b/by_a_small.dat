5|$|Anatomically, spiders {{differ from}} other {{arthropods}} {{in that the}} usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, the cephalothorax and abdomen, and joined <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> cylindrical pedicel.

In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax. Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure.|$|E
