5|$|Significant {{logistical}} operations {{take place}} to bring people into the festival by public transport each year. Additional festival trains are provided to Castle Cary railway station, mostly from London Paddington. The station operates as a mini hub with waiting shuttle buses transferring passengers from Castle Cary to the festival site as required. This is an intensive operation on the Wednesday and Thursday each year with local bus and coach operators providing these buses over the two days. Additional extra buses normally provided by Go South Coast run from Bristol to the festival. On the Monday, passengers are transferred <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> one day with additional buses provided to meet the increased requirement. National Express provide extra coaches direct to the festival site from major UK towns and much of this work is subcontracted to smaller coach operators to provide the capacity required.|$|E

Typically a single train is used while the other comes out during busier times.|$|E

50|$|In 2006, Polaris Shipping Co Ltd, Seoul, {{purchased}} four single-hulled oil tankers, including Sunrise III, for {{conversion to}} very large ore carriers (VLOC) at Cosco (Zhoushan) Shipyard in China. At the time, {{this was a}} typical strategy to increase the lifetime of an otherwise obsolete vessel by another 10 to 14 years and, thanks to the high charter rates of large bulk carriers used to transport iron ore to China, the conversion would pay itself <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> one to two years. Typically, the center tanks of the oil tanker would be split into dry cargo holds while the side tanks {{would be used for}} ballast or remain empty. Holes cut on the main deck for cargo hatches and coamings would require additional structural strengthening to retain sufficient longitudinal strength after conversion. A tank top strengthened for high loading rate and grab unloading would be fitted above the bottom frames and girders. The vessel returned to service in 2008 as Stellar Daisy.|$|E

5000|$|Another of the Moonbase crew, Ralph, has {{disappeared}} in the food stores, and the Moonbase radio transmissions are being monitored from somewhere else on the moon. Jamie has been placed in the sickbay where, feverish and delirious, he begins mumbling about a [...] "Phantom Piper", a figure which Jamie believes appears to a McCrimmon before he dies. While attending to Jamie, Polly sees a large figure leave through the door. When Hobson, the Doctor, Ben, John and Nils arrive to collect Evans' body, it {{has disappeared}}. They then leave to investigate where this 'piper' is. Polly goes to get water, and Jamie wakes {{up to see the}} 'piper' advancing on him.The 'piper' ignores Jamie, as he doesn't have the disease, so he steals another patient and leaves. Polly comes <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> as the figure is leaving and recognises it as a Cyberman, and the Doctor realises their old enemies are stalking the Moonbase and taking the patients' bodies. Hobson brushes away the cyber-story, believing they died out years ago. He gives the Doctor 24 hours to discover the cause of the virus, or else he and his companions must leave the moon.|$|E
50|$|Devance and Intal weren't {{able to play}} {{much because}} of {{injuries}} but B-Meg once again booked {{a ticket to the}} 2012 Governors' Cup Finals against Rain or Shine after beating Barangay Ginebra, 74-72 courtesy of a Peter June Simon follow up. B-Meg dropped their first game 91-80, but the resilient Llamados bounced back and defeated Rain or Shine 85-80, where Yap was named Best Player of the Game with 24 pts, 9 rebound performance. But B-Meg lost two straight with a 93-84 (where Cone benched his superstars in the final quarter and put Marqus Blakey and Pingris <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> few minutes remaining) and 94-89 respectively and RoS led the series 3-1. But Yap exploded for a conference high 57 points and dedicated his performance to the late former President Corazon Aquino, his former mother-in-law as they defeated the E-Painters,91-81. He scored again with 20 pts in the crucial Game 6 and they won in convincing fashion, 97-81 to tie the series at 3-all with Simon being hailed as the Best Player of the Game. B-Meg looks to be the 4th team to come back from a 1-3 deficit (they accomplished this in 2006). They also look for their first back-to-back championships. However, the Elasto Painters fought hard in Game 7 and defeated B-Meg, 83-76 despite Yap's 23 point performance. The Llamados have missed crucial shots during crunch and their import Blakely being fouled out early in the fourth quarter and Rain or Shine took advantage.|$|E
