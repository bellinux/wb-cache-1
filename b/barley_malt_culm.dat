5|$|Nearly all beer {{includes}} <b>barley</b> <b>malt</b> as {{the majority}} of the starch. This is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing. After <b>malting,</b> <b>barley</b> is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain with the grain during the mash, and act as a filter bed during lautering, when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and rye, and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. Some brewers have produced gluten-free beer, made with sorghum with no <b>barley</b> <b>malt,</b> for those who cannot consume gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} was {{examined}} composition and content of nitrogen fractions in extracts of different grains mixtures, in different conditions of thermal digestion of extracts. Reaction mixtures were prepared out of <b>barley</b> <b>malt</b> and of certain portion (by 30 %) of adjuncts: raw barley, corn grits and rice. The control sample was 100 % <b>barley</b> <b>malt.</b> Lower concentrations of α-amino nitrogen (FAN) in the extracts prepared of grains replacement {{are the result of}} the: lower content of proteins in these grains, unfavorable pH-values for decomposition of particular proteins, but because of the weaker enzyme effects of <b>barley</b> <b>malt</b> peptidases, as well. Studying the concentration of nitrogen fractions in extracts treated in different conditions of thermal digestion, it is noted that concentrations of these decomposable products are lower in fermentable extracts treated by overpressure thermal digestion, in relation to the termal digestion by STP. We suggest decreasing initial teemperature of extraction to 38 °C and holding the extract at the same temperature for a half an hour. This results shows that with this procedure of extraction it is possible to get extracts with optimal composition and satisfying content of nitrogen fractions. The mixture of maize grits and <b>barley</b> <b>malt</b> show the most favourable content of nitrogen fractions in extracts.

The xylose (Xyl) levels of centrifuged wort (indicative of arabinoxylan levels) made from 100 % <b>barley</b> <b>malt</b> were 0. 46, 0. 70, and 0. 55 % (% dry matter), while the corresponding malt water-extractable Xyl contents were 0. 31, 0. 44, and 0. 41 %. The Xyl levels in centrifuged worts from 60 % <b>barley</b> <b>malt</b> and 40 % wheat (0. 37 - 0. 58 %) depended mainly on the water-extractable arabinoxylan content of the starting material. The endoxylanolytic levels of the malts had only minor effect on the resulting Xyl contents of the worts. The increase of Xyl levels during mashing with 40 % wheat (0. 05 - 0. 10 %) were 12 - 58 % lower than 60 % {{of the increase in}} Xyl with a corresponding 100 % malt wort. The addition of the endoxylanase from B. subtilis increased the centrifuged wort Xyl level. Experiments in which the endoxylanolytic activity of malt extracts was measured in the presence of wheat water-extractables provided evidence for the presence of one or more endoxylanase inhibitors in wheat that are inactivated by heat treatment. The wheat inhibitors however did not inactivate the B. subtilis endoxylanase. status: publishe...|$|R
