500|$|Critics reacted {{positively}} to the episode. Joseph P.

[...] Joyce Millman of Salon.com stated that she disliked Seinfelds pilot episode, but after seeing a scene from [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend" [...] in which Jerry and Kramer discuss returning fruit, she was [...] "awed by Seinfeld and co-creator/writer Larry David's brilliant grasp of, A) working-class Jewish craziness, and, B) the absurd humor of the deeply mundane." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2012 the Dumas was {{conveyed}} to new owners, locals Michael Piche and Travis Eskelson. By this time however, {{the building was}} in great disrepair; among other things, there was water damage, a collapsed wall and no structurally sound roof. The new owners planned to have summer tours for $8 in the following year, but their ultimate goal was turning the Dumas into a bed and breakfast. [...] "It needs to be around. It needs to <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> {{the rest of the}} community and {{the people who want to}} visit it," [...] said Piche. In late 2013 the duo sought a loan from the local urban revitalization body in Butte. The requested amount was $92,000 with an additional $8,750 grant. As of December 2013, tours were still being offered at the Dumas on a limited basis.|$|E

500|$|Betty was the longest-serving barmaid of the soap's public house, The Rovers Return. She first served {{behind the}} bar in 1969 and had been shown to work there for 42 years, as of 2011. There have been brief breaks however, as storylines {{have led to the}} {{character}} being fired or quitting her post. She was fired by Annie Walker (Doris Speed), who accused her of theft, and she quit her post in 1995 when Jack (Bill Tarmey) and Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn) took over as landlords. In the summer of 2009, Betty was sacked again temporarily by manager Poppy Morales. A Coronation Street insider reassured The Sun that Betty was not being written out of the show, however, stating: [...] "She’ll <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> {{a long time to come}} – she’ll just be on the other side of the bar for a change". In a storyline that aired in February 2010, Betty – at 90 years old – was named Manchester's Oldest Barmaid. In a plot twist, a 91-year-old rival came forward, resulting in Betty fearing she killed her, when the rival consumes a two-month-old hotpot.|$|E
500|$|On 1 August 2017, Abbasi {{was elected}} Prime Minister of Pakistan by the National Assembly, {{defeating}} his rival Naveed Qamar of the PPP by 221 votes to 47. Jamiat Ulema-e Islam (F) and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement also supported his election. Addressing the National Assembly after his election, he said [...] "I may <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> 45 days or 45 hours, but I'm {{not here to}} keep the seat warm. I intend to work and get some important things done." [...] On that same day, he {{was sworn in as}} the Prime Minister in an oath-taking ceremony at Presidency Palace. After he took charge, Nawaz Sharif decided that Shehbaz Sharif would remain in Punjab and Abbasi would continue as Prime Minister until the 2018 general election to be held in June. According to Rana Sanaullah Khan, PML (N) senior leadership feared that abandonment of the post of Chief Ministership of Punjab by Shahbaz Sharif would weaken the party's hold in the country's most populous province, which has 183 out of the 342 seats in the National Assembly and plays a crucial role in determining the future government in Pakistan.|$|E
500|$|Critics reacted {{positively}} to the season. During its 1991 Program awards, Entertainment Weekly, ranked Seinfeld {{second place in}} the [...] "Program of the year" [...] category, behind Roseanne. Joseph P. Kahn, a critic for the Wilmington Morning Star, praised the writing and acting of the season premiere and stated, [...] "One safe prediction, Seinfeld will <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> a good long run this time around." [...] Writing for The Spokesman-Review, critic Jon Burlingame stated that [...] "Seinfeld is an offbeat take on the standard sitcom concept. While rarely hilarious, it's often smart and amusing." [...] Dave Kehr of The New York Times felt that [...] "The Pony Remark" [...] was a turning point for the show, noting that after the first few episodes, the show [...] "turn into something sharp and distinctive [...] Here, suddenly, is the tight knot of guilt and denial, of hypersensitivity and sarcastic contempt that Seinfeld would explore for the next eight years." [...] Despite the critical acclaim for the season and several of its episodes, two of the season's episodes, [...] "The Busboy" [...] and [...] "The Baby Shower", were named to a list of Seinfelds [...] "Not-so-top episodes", compiled by the New York Daily News.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, Aulie was {{assigned}} to the Marlies after training camp with the Maple Leafs. [...] He was later called up to the NHL on November 12, 2010, when Dion Phaneuf was injured. Aulie played his first career NHL game the next day against the Vancouver Canucks, playing 12 games total with the Maple Leafs in his call-up before ultimately being returned to the Marlies. Despite the time he spent away from the AHL, Aulie was selected to the Western Conference team for the AHL All-Star Game. During the Skills Competition, Aulie competed in the hardest shot event, finishing third, with a top speed of 95.5mph. After the Maple Leafs traded defenceman François Beauchemin to the Anaheim Ducks, Aulie was called up to rejoin the team. Maple Leafs General Manager Brian Burke said {{one of the reasons for}} the trade was to open up a spot at the NHL level for Aulie: [...] "...as soon as we get a roster spot, we're calling up Keith Aulie. We expect him to <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> a while." [...] Aulie engaged in his first career NHL fight against Scott Hartnell of the Philadelphia Flyers, earning him the nickname [...] "Muhammad Aulie."

Schiller indicated that the plant was largely undamaged, and that the main impediment to full reopening {{was the lack of}} adequate electric service, as well as the fact that rail lines were closed.|$|E
