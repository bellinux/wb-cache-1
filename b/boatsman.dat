25|$|Catarafts are {{constructed}} {{from the same}} materials as rafts. They can either be paddled or rowed with oars. Typical catarafts {{are constructed}} from two inflatable pontoons {{on either side of}} the craft that are bridged by a frame. Oar-propelled catarafts have the occupants sitting on seats mounted on the frame. Virtually all oar-powered catarafts are operated by a <b>boatsman</b> with passengers having no direct responsibilities. Catarafts can be of all sizes; many are smaller and more maneuverable than a typical raft.|$|E
25|$|The Swedish Navy {{recruited}} their seamen {{using the}} same system as the army, but from coastal provinces and towns (including non-coastal towns). As with the infantry, the farms in coastal areas were organized into rotar, which would each provide a croft (båtmanstorp) for a navy volunteer. Recruits only had duties on board the ships, for example as artillerymen or sailors, and were not used for other combat duties, such as boardings and landings, which were executed by army units transported on the ships. The seamen often served in the navy six months over the summer of every third year. Later, {{from the middle of}} the 18th century, some of the rotar in the cities would pay a fee equal to the approximate cost of providing a <b>boatsman,</b> instead of providing one from among themselves.|$|E
2500|$|To help boats leave (downstream) a lock, the locksman would {{sometimes}} open the paddles {{to create a}} swell, which would help [...] "flush" [...] the boat out of the lock. In one case, a <b>boatsman</b> asked for a back swell, that is, open and shut the paddles {{a few times to}} create some waves, to help him get off the bank where he was stuck. If boats ran aground (from being overloaded) they sometimes asked passing crews to tell the upstream lock to give them an extra heavy swell, which consisted of opening all the paddles on the lock gate, creating a surge that affected the whole pound below.|$|E
