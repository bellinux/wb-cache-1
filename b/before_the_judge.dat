5|$|Marshall {{opened a}} law {{practice}} in Columbia City in 1876, taking on many minor cases. After gaining prominence, he accepted William F. McNagny {{as a partner}} in 1879 and began taking many criminal defense cases. The two men functioned well as partners. McNagny was better educated in law and worked out their legal arguments. Marshall, the superior orator, argued the cases <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> and jury. Their firm became well known in the region after they handled a number of high-profile cases. In 1880 Marshall ran for public office {{for the first time as}} the Democratic candidate for his district's prosecuting attorney. The district was a Republican stronghold, and he was defeated. About the same time, he met and began to court Kate Hooper, and the two became engaged to marry. Kate died of an illness in 1882, one day before they were to be wed. Her death was a major emotional blow to Marshall, leading him to become an alcoholic.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{has been}} arrested several times for {{marijuana}} possession. The first occasion was in 1974 in Dallas, Texas. In 1977 after a tour with Hank Cochran, Nelson traveled to The Bahamas. Nelson and Cochran arrived late {{to the airport and}} boarded the flight without luggage. The bags were later sent to them. As Nelson and Cochran claimed their luggage in the Bahamas, a customs officer questioned Nelson after marijuana was found in a pair of his jeans. Nelson was arrested and jailed. As Cochran made arrangements to pay the bail, he took Nelson a six-pack of beer to his cell. Nelson was released a few hours later. Inebriated, he fell after he jumped celebrating and was taken to the emergency room. He then appeared <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge,</b> who dropped the charges but ordered Nelson to never return to the country.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} day, prosecutor Anatoly Zadorozhny {{delivered his}} closing argument <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge.</b> Harking towards the earlier testimony of psychiatrists at the trial, Zadorozhny argued that Chikatilo fully understood the criminality of his actions, {{was able to}} resist his homicidal impulses, and had made numerous conscious efforts to avoid detection. Moreover, Zadorozhny emphasized that in 19 of the charges, the material evidence of the crimes had been provided by Chikatilo himself. Zadorozhny then recited each of the charges before formally requesting the death penalty.|$|E

25|$|In November 2008 Gonzales {{was indicted}} by {{a grand jury}} in Willacy County in Texas. He was accused of {{stopping}} an investigation into abuses at the Willacy Detention Center, a federal detention center. Vice President Dick Cheney and other elected officials were also indicted. A judge dismissed the indictments and chastised the Willacy County district attorney, Juan Angel Gonzales, who brought the case. The district attorney himself had been under indictment {{for more than a}} year and a half <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> dismissed the indictment. The district attorney left office after losing in a Democratic primary in March 2008. All charges were dropped after further investigation.|$|E
25|$|At sentencing, the judge, by a {{preponderance}} of the evidence, determined that Fanfan was responsible for 2.5 kilograms of cocaine powder, and 261.6grams of crack and was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in the criminal activity. This would have resulted 188 to 235 months sentence under the Guidelines, which was a 10-year increase in the sentencing range above that which the jury found. The Supreme Court issued its Blakely decision four days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> imposed Fanfan's sentence. The sentencing judge, believing that Blakely had implications on federal judges increasing sentences on facts not found by juries, imposed the 78 month maximum sentence based on the jury's verdict. The Government asked the judge to correct Fanfanâ€™s sentence, which was denied.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{advice from}} his attorney, Gacy entered a {{plea of guilty}} to one count of sodomy in {{relation}} to the charges filed against him by Donald Voorhees. He pleaded not guilty to the other charges lodged against him by other youths at a formal arraignment held on November 7, 1968. <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge,</b> Gacy contended that he and Voorhees had indeed engaged in sexual relations, yet he insisted Voorhees had offered his sexual services to him and that he had acted out of curiosity. His story was not believed. Despite his lawyers' recommendations for parole, Gacy was convicted of sodomy on December 3, 1968, and sentenced to 10 years at the Anamosa State Penitentiary. On the day Gacy was convicted and sentenced, his wife petitioned for divorce, requesting possession of the couple's home, property, sole custody of their two children and subsequent alimony payments. The Court ruled in her favor and the divorce was finalized on September 18, 1969. Gacy never saw his first wife or children again.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of this exercise {{because it is}} such a common and necessary command for a dog. Generally the handler will order the dog to sit and stay and then the judge will order the handler {{to walk away from the}} dog. Depending on the level of the competition the judge will order the handler to: walk around the ring, walk to the other side of the ring and wait for an order to return, or walk out of sight of the dog and wait for an order to return. In the later two cases the length of time <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> orders the handler to return, and the time the dog must remain sitting, increases depending on the class the team is competing in. This exercise can also be performed in a group where as many as 10 dogs may perform the exercise simultaneously. In any case should a dog break the sit by lying down or getting up to walk around the team will usually fail the exercise and receive a non qualifying score for the class.|$|E
25|$|Among the few {{revisions}} Devil's Due instituted was {{the expansion}} of Cobra Commander's origin. After his brother's death, the future Commander sought out the surviving son of the family killed by Dan. He found the soldier (Snake Eyes) at a bar, where the Commander saved him from an oncoming truck and the two became friends. They traveled from state to state, acting as vigilantes. One night, Cobra Commander took Snake Eyes {{to the house of}} a corrupt Judge who he blamed for the hardships they had both experienced: years <b>before,</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> had presided over a case involving Cobra Commander's brother Dan, who ran a veteran's hospital. The hospital had been burned down by a patient, but the judge ruled that it was insurance fraud; Dan lost everything and turned to drinking, which led to the crash that took his life and the lives of Snake Eyes' family. Realizing where his anger had taken him, Snake Eyes refused to kill the man and walked away. Cobra Commander killed the judge himself and vowed revenge against Snake Eyes for having turned on him.|$|E
25|$|One {{contention}} by {{some tax}} protesters {{is that a}} taxpayer {{should be allowed to}} introduce, as evidence in court, copies of statutes, cases or other materials to persuade the jury about what the law is. Courts do not allow this procedure as, under the U.S. legal system, the general rule is that neither side in a civil or criminal case is allowed to try to prove to the jury what the law is. For example, in a murder case the defendant is not allowed to persuade the jury that there is no law against murder, or to try to interpret the law for the jury. Likewise, the prosecution is not allowed to do this. Instead, disagreements about what the law is are argued by both sides <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge,</b> who then makes a ruling. Prior to jury deliberations, the judge instructs the jury on the law. Examples of applications of this rule in tax controversies are United States v. Ambort, United States v. Bonneau, and United States v. Willie.|$|E

500|$|Despite these {{regional}} differences, Hampton credits Illmatic {{with providing}} a common artistic ground for rappers on the West Coast and East Coast rap scenes. In the 2009 essay [...] "Born Alone, Die Alone," [...] she recounts the album's impact on West Coast artist, Tupac Shakur. While {{working as a}} journalist for The Source in 1994, Hampton covered three court cases involving Tupac. Around this time, she received an advance-copy of Illmatic and immediately dubbed a cassette version for Tupac, who became [...] "an instant convert" [...] of the album. The next day, she writes, Tupac [...] "arrived in his assigned courtroom blasting Illmatic so loudly that the bailiff yelled at him {{to turn it off}} <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> took his seat on the bench." [...] In her essay, Hampton implies that Nas' lyricism might have influenced Tupac's acclaimed album, Me Against the World, which was recorded that same year.|$|E
500|$|The Mint Act of 1837 {{established}} the Assay Commission {{in the form}} it would have {{for most of the}} remainder of its existence.

[...] The usual procedure for members of the public to be named to the commission after public appointments began was for the Mint Director to send the president a list of candidates for his approval.
