40|$|<b>Backward</b> <b>demodulation</b> is a simpli cation {{technique}} used in saturation-based theorem proving with superposition and ordered paramodulation. It requires instance retrieval, i. e., search for instances of some term in a typically large set of terms. Path indexing {{is a family}} of indexing techniques {{that can be used}} to solve this problem efficiently. We propose a number of powerful optimisations to standard path indexing. We also describe a novel framework that combines path indexing with relational joins. The main advantage of the proposed scheme is exibility, which we illustrate by sketching how to adapt the scheme to instance retrieval modulo commutativity and backward subsumption on multi-literal clauses...|$|E
40|$|Otter is a clause-based {{theorem prover}} for rst-order logic with equality. It oers the infer-ence rules binary resolution, hyperresolution, unit-resulting resolution, and paramodulation; it also oers forward and {{backward}} subsumption, forward and <b>backward</b> <b>demodulation</b> (rewriting), term ordering, Knuth-Bendix completion, answer literals, and conversion of rst-order formulas to clauses. Otter 3. 0 {{can be used in}} two modes. In the ordinary mode, the user species inferences rules and a search strategy, and in the autonomous mode (new in Otter 3. 0, see below) the user simply supplies a set of clauses. The goal in building Otter was to have a fast, production-quality theorem prover for experimenting with new methods and for assisting mathematicians and logicians with their research. At the core ofOtter is a straightforwardmechanism, the given-clause algorithm, for drawing inferences and searching for a refutation with the set of support strategy. The given-clause algorithm operates mainly on two lists of clauses, sos and usable. At the start of the search, sos is the supported clauses, and usable is the nonsupported clauses. The main loop of the given-clause algorithm is the following. While (sos is not empty and no refutation has been found...|$|E
