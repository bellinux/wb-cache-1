30|$|Central Asia {{is one of}} {{the regions}} that suffer the most {{prominent}} transboundary water and energy problems in the world. Effective transboundary water-energy resource management and cooperation are closely related with socioeconomic development and stability in the entire Central Asia. Similar to Central Asia, Northwest China has an arid climate and is experiencing a water shortage. It is now facing imbalanced supply—demand relations of water and energy resources. These issues in Northwest China and Central Asia pose severe challenges in the implementation of the Silk Road Economic Belt strategy. Based on the analysis of water and energy distribution characteristics in Central Asia as well as demand characteristics of different countries, the complexity of local transboundary water problems was explored by reviewing corresponding historical problems of involved countries, correlated energy issues, and the evolution of inter-country water-energy cooperation. With references to experiences and lessons of five countries, contradictions, opportunities, challenges and strategies for transboundary water-energy cooperation between China and Central Asia were discussed under the promotion of the Silk Road Economic <b>Belt</b> <b>construction</b> based on current cooperation conditions.|$|E

Engineering overview With the rapid development of construction industry, reinforced concrete structure appeared super-long, oversized trend, and the shrinkage in hardening process of deformation greatly increased the risk of permeable crack. For the large underground industry tank, due to the inherent property of the concrete material itself and the unique plate (shell) system and the restraint form, the requirement for anti-seepage, crack resistance of concrete is higher [1], we should take effective measures to control the non-structural cracks, ensure egineering quality.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the failure {{analysis}} of a conveyor belt related {{to the place of}} impact where material lands. It studies how the number of conveyor carrying idlers influences the belt compression stress in the place of impact. The landing material is represented by an impactor of 500 kg landing from the height of 4 m. The analyses are grounded in mathematical modelling of the transport belt and experimentally determine the quantities vital for the simulations. The place of impact under examination is the critical site of the whole facility as it is subject to extreme stress. The failure analysis considers two variants of idler number in the place of material impact. The results clearly demonstrate that the construction making use of a higher number of idlers is more suitable due to lower deformations of the belt. The conclusions presented in the article may thus lead to conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>construction</b> optimisations, and thus contribute to their longer life. At the same time, there is a great potential for further research, as the topic of longer conveyor belt life via changing the number of carrying idlers at the place of impact has not been widely investigated.

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{two sets}} of performance ratings for light-duty-vehicle tires. The aim was to ascertain whether some of the ratings in either set convey redundant information. The first set included the Uniform Tire Quality Grade (UTQG) ratings for 2, 734 tires, published by the U. S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The second set consisted of ratings for 49 tires published by Consumer Reports. The approach consisted of using factor analysis {{to determine whether the}} number of variables in the two sets (3 in UTQG, and 11 in Consumer Reports) can be reduced to a smaller number of independent factors. The results indicate that the three UTQG variables form two factors. The first is dominated by tread properties, while the second factor reflects tread-abrasion resistance. The two factors accounted for 83 % of the variance. The 11 Consumer Reports variables form four factors. These factors are dominated, in turn, by tread properties, the tire (and especially <b>belt)</b> <b>construction,</b> tread-band flexibility (particularly in the longitudinal direction), and tread-abrasion resistance. Each of the 11 variables loaded highly on at least one factor. The four factors accounted for 68 % of the variance. The examination of the factors in each analysis suggests that each factor that is highly loaded by more than one variable represents richer and more complex information than what smaller subsets of variables could capture. Therefore, none of the variables could be excluded if one wants to provide the same information conveyed by the full sets of the variables...|$|E
40|$|We give a {{classical}} confidence <b>belt</b> <b>construction</b> which unifies {{the treatment of}} upper confidence limits for null results and two-sided confidence intervals for non-null results. The unified treatment solves a problem (apparently not previously recognized) that the choice of upper limit or two-sided intervals leads to intervals which are not confidence intervals if the choice {{is based on the}} data. We apply the construction to two related problems which have recently been a battle-ground between classical and Bayesian statistics: Poisson processes with background, and Gaussian errors with a bounded physical region. In contrast with the usual classical construction for upper limits, our construction avoids unphysical confidence intervals. In contrast with some popular Bayesian intervals, our intervals eliminate conservatism (frequentist coverage greater than the stated confidence) in the Gaussian case and reduce it to a level dictated by discreteness in the Poisson case. We generalize the method in order to apply it to analysis of experiments searching for neutrino oscillations. We show that this technique both gives correct coverage and is powerful, while other classical techniques that have been used by neutrino oscillation search experiments fail one or both of these criteria.

40|$|The {{indentation}} {{rolling resistance}} of conveyor belts {{is an important}} design consideration for long belt conveyors and can also be important for heavily loaded belt conveyors. Indentation rolling resistance {{is dependent on the}} properties of the conveyor belt, including the carcass and bottom cover as well as properties of the belt conveyor including induced loads, belt speed, ambient temperature and idler roll diameter. A purpose built laboratory test facility is described to measure the indentation rolling resistance of conveyor belts.

Results are presented for a range of test parameters, including; load, belt speed, idler roll diameter, ambient temperature and bottom cover compound.
