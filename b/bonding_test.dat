40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the issues associated with parasitic surface conduction (PSC) in oxidized high resistivity (HR) Si wafers, such as HR SOI, in which PSC is related to the presence of free carriers at the substrate surface. Most of these issues are suppressed when the substrate surface is passivated with a trap-rich layer of material, such as polysilicon. A technique to fabricate substrate-passivated HR SOI wafer is presented, where the wafers are obtained by bonding a polysilicon-passivated HR Si substrate with an oxidized donor substrate.

40|$|The {{existing}} {{reinforced concrete}} structures may require rehabilitation and strengthening to overcome deficiencies due to defect and environmental deterioration. Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) -concrete bonding systems can provide {{solution for the}} deficiencies, but the durability of the bonded joint needs to be investigated for reliable structural performance. In this research the interfacial bonding behaviour of CFRP-concrete system under tropical climate exposure is main interest. A 300 mm concrete prism was bonded with CFRP plate on its two sides and exposed for 3, 6, and 9 months to laboratory environment, continuous natural weather, and wet-dry exposure in 3. 5 % saltwater solution at room and 40 °C temperature. The prisms were subjected to tension and compression load under <b>bonding</b> <b>test</b> to measure the strain and determine stress distribution and shear stress transfer behaviour. The results of the <b>bonding</b> <b>test</b> showed that load transfer was fairly linear and uniform at lower load level and changed to non-linear and non- uniform at higher load level. The force transfers causes the shear stress distribution being shifted along the bonded length. The combination of climate effects may have provided better curing of the bonded joints, but longer duration of exposure {{may be required to}} weaken the bond strength. Nevertheless, CFRP-concrete bonding system was only minimally affected under the tropical climate and salt solution...|$|E

40|$|Background: Recent {{advances}} in enamel and dentine adhesive technology {{have resulted in}} the emergence of many new adhesive systems. Self-etching bonding systems do not require a separate etching step and the newest systems are the "all-in-one" systems which combine etching, priming and bonding into a single application. This study reports laboratory enamel microshear bond strengths of a self-etching priming and three all-in-one systems and also evaluates two different microshear <b>bond</b> <b>test</b> methods. Methods: One hundred and nineteen enamel specimens were bonded (0. 8 mm diameter) with either Clearfil Protect Bond (Kuraray), Xeno III (Dentsply), G Bond (GC) or One-Up Bond F (Tokuyama) using Palfique Estelite resin composite and stored in 37 °C water for seven days. The microshear <b>bond</b> <b>test</b> method used either a blade or wire to apply the shear stress. Results were analysed with one-way ANOVA and post hoc (Tukey) multiple comparison analysis. Results: Clearfil Protect Bond demonstrated higher and more consistent bond strengths than Xeno III, G Bond or One-Up Bond F. The wire method showed much greater reliability in results, with a coefficient of variation half that of the blade method. Conclusions: All-in-one adhesives seem to be less reliable than the two-step self-etching priming adhesive when bonding to enamel.

In order to assess the influence of geometrical and mechanical properties of the adhesive on the debonding load, parametric analyses have been carried out by means of some selected bond strength models.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the effects of {{different}} enamel conditioning techniques for bracket bonding. Methods: Ninety-one human premolars were randomly divided in six groups of 15 specimens each. The enamel surfaces of the teeth were etched with 35 % orthophosphoric acid in Group 1, with a self-etching primer in Group 2, sandblasted in Group 3, sandblasted and etched with 35 % orthophosphoric acid in Group 4, conditioned by Er:YAG laser in Group 5 and conditioned by Er:YAG laser and etched with 35 % phosphoric acid gel respectively in Group 6. After enamel conditioning procedures, brackets were bonded and shear <b>bonding</b> <b>test</b> was performed. After debonding, adhesive remnant index scores were calculated for all groups. One tooth from each group were inspected by scanning electron microscope for evaluating the enamel surface characteristics. Results: The laser and acid etched group showed the highest mean shear bond strength (SBS) value (13. 61 ± 1. 14 MPa) while sandblasted group yielded the lowest value (3. 12 ± 0. 61 MPa). Conclusions: Although the SBS values were higher, the teeth in laser conditioned groups were highly damaged.

Several algorithms to test the hardware functionality and performance have been developed and implemented into an object-oriented software framework. Examples are the pixel readout test, the bump <b>bonding</b> <b>test</b> or the noise measurement. The qualification procedure also includes calibration routines. For instance the gain of each pixel or the temperature sensors of the readout chips have to be calibrated. Furthermore, an algorithm to unify the thresholds of all pixels was developed. According to specific quality criteria, each module is graded into one of three categories. Out of 981 tested modules, 806 were qualified for the usage in the detector. The second part of this work deals with a Monte-Carlo study of the Higgs decay channel H→τ^+τ^-→ l^+l^-Et with a jet balancing the large transverse momentum of the Higgs boson. In contrast to many other studies, the analysis concentrates not on the vector boson fusion but on the gluon fusion production mechanism. The backgrounds are mainly suppressed by requiring a large invariant mass of the Higgs boson and the balancing jet.

The results obtained are summarized as follows: (1) When particle-mat is heated by hot-press platen, {{the time required to}} reach a temperature of 110 °C {{at the center of the}} mat thickness (20 mm) is about 25 min, while it only 2. 5 min in the case of microwave heating (Fig. 1).

These heat transfer and moisture movement in particle-mat are contrary to that in hot-press method (Fig. 2 - 4). And so, the density profils throughout the thickness of the boards by both heating method show a contrary inclination (Fig. 5). (3) As shown in Fig. 2 and 3, the boards by microwave heating method show higher strength values than the ones by hot-press method not only in internal <b>bonding</b> <b>test</b> but also in bending test. In these data, the values of modulus of rupture seem to be affected to some degree by internal shear strength of boards, as the span-depth ratio used bending test is not large enough.

40|$|Externally Bonded FRP Reinforcement (EBR) {{has become}} a popular {{technique}} for Reinforced Concrete (RC) structures strengthening. Several theoretical models, based on the fracture mechanics, have been developed by researchers {{in the last years}} to estimate the debonding load of Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) reinforcement applied on concrete surface. Theoretical fracture energy relationships generally include parameters calibrated with experimental data obtained by FRP-concrete <b>bond</b> <b>test.</b> The main available experimental FRP-concrete <b>bond</b> <b>tests</b> show that the most used test procedure is the Single Shear Test (SST) and the largest part of tests involved FRP sheets rather than plates. The results of 34 SST tests carried out by authors on both CFRP sheets (18) and plates (16) are reported and discussed in the present paper; a comparison between plates and sheets reinforcements in terms of debonding load is also given. Based on an enlarged database of FRP-concrete <b>bond</b> <b>tests,</b> a refined calibration of the experimental coefficient {{to be used in the}} design equations provided by CNR-DT 200 / 2004 to compute fracture energy for EBR FRP strengthening has been performed; the calibration has been separately performed for sheets and plates in order to specifically take into account the influence of the type of reinforcement on fracture energy. Finally a comparison between experimental results and theoretical predictions provided by the re-calibrated CNR-DT 200 / 2004 equation, fib bulletin 14 and ACI 440. 2 R- 08 is reported...|$|R
