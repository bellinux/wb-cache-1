25|$|<b>Beach</b> <b>nourishment</b> (also {{referred}} to as beach renourishment, beach replenishment, or sand replenishment) describes a process by which sediment, usually sand, lost through longshore drift or erosion is replaced from other sources.

40|$|Beaches {{are one of}} {{the most}} dynamic environments on earth. They provide storm surge protection, flood control, {{recreational}} activities, habitat for a variety of plants and animals and also provide an important source of income for economies around the country through tourism. Impacts on beaches from natural and anthropogenic sources of erosion are becoming more prevalent as sea levels rise and urban coastal areas grow in population. As a result, engineered erosion control techniques were developed to mitigate for beach erosion and protect coastal development. Early forms of these techniques included the use of engineered hard structures such as seawalls, jetties and groins to armor the coast line but they often have unintended impacts or side effects. <b>Beach</b> <b>nourishments,</b> which are increasingly employed around the United States, are considered a more environmentally friendly method by some and are now the preferred method of choice for engineered coastal protection. There is much debate as to whether erosion control techniques, including <b>beach</b> <b>nourishments,</b> are an effective mitigation tool for beach erosion or if tactics such as human population retreat are a better solution. Due to the large number of people that live and recreate near beaches and the economies that rely on the tourism generated earnings, retreat is not a viable option.

40|$|Coastal {{areas have}} been {{historically}} characterized as being a source of wealth. Nowadays, beaches have become more relevant as a place for rest and leisure. This had led to a very high population pressure due to rapid urbanisation processes. The impacts associated with coastal tourism, demand the development of anthropic actions to protect the shoreline. This paper has studied the impacts of these actions on the Marineta Cassiana beach, in Denia, Spain. This particular Mediterranean beach has traditionally suffered a major shoreline regression, and the <b>beach</b> <b>nourishments</b> {{carried out in the}} 1980 s would not have achieved the reliability desired. This research has analysed the historic evolution of the beach and its environment for a period of 65 years (1950 â€“ 2015). A Geographic Information System (GIS) has been used to integrate and perform a spatial analysis of urban development, soil erosion, stream flow, swell, longshore transport, submerged vegetation species and shoreline evolution. The results show how the anthropic actions have affected the shoreline. After the excessive urban development of the catchments, there is no natural sediment supply to the beach. The change in the typology of the sediment, from pebbles to sand, during the <b>beach</b> <b>nourishments</b> has led to a crucial imbalance in the studied area. Moreover, the beach area gained has disappeared, affecting the Posidonia oceanica meadow, and incrementing the erosion rates.

40|$|If {{the wave}} climate is {{dominated}} by a wave approach in deep water that is very oblique {{with respect to the}} shoreline, the littoral drift may render the rectilinear trend of the shoreline unstable. This instability causes large scale shoreline sand waves (L 1 - 10 km, T 1 - 10 yr) that grow and propagate along the coast, implying erosional hot spots. This was known to be primarily due to gradients in alongshore transport rate. However, it is here shown that the cross-shore transport is also essential to the instability, the faster the relaxation to the equilibrium profile, the stronger the instability. Furthermore, it is found that the cross-shore location of the initial bathymetric perturbation is very important. The maximum efficiency in triggering the instability corresponds to perturbations spread across both the surf and shoaling zones. In contrast, for a perturbation confined only in the surf zone, the development may be so slow that the instability is hardly relevant to coastal engineering.

40|$|Here {{we present}} {{data on the}} wax and wane of a subtidal Ensis directus {{population}} which settled in 2009 {{off the coast of}} Egmond (North Holland Coast in The Netherlands). Initial densities decreased from a maximum of 700 m- 2 in early 2010 to about 50 m- 2 in June 2013. In this period the average length increased from ~ 4 cm to ~ 12 cm. In 2011 â€“ 2012 the population was sampled at 3 to 6 week intervals and near bottom environmental conditions were monitored continuously. Samples of animals that were collected were used to follow the change in gonadal mass, tissue glycogen content, tissue weight and shell length. On the basis of these data well defined seasonal cycles were observed. The data indicate that the maturation of gonadal tissue already starts early in the year, initially at the expense of somatic tissue. Main spawning takes place in May. After spawning net somatic tissue growth starts after compensation of losses due to spawning. Somatic growth precedes shell growth which starts at water temperatures exceeding 12 â€“ 14 Â°C.

2500|$|The {{proportion}} of total sand in a beach that lies below the waterline (submersion fraction) critically impacts <b>beach</b> <b>nourishment.</b> Two beaches {{with the same}} amount of visible sand may be much different below the surface. An eroded beach with substantial submerged sand surrounding it may recover without nourishment. Nourishing a beach that has little submerged sand requires understanding of the reason that the submerged sand is missing. The same forces that stripped the submerged sand once are likely to do so again. The amount of submerged sand eroded is typically much greater than the amount of missing sand on shore. Replacing only the visible sand is insufficient unless the submerged sand is also replaced. Otherwise, the beach is unstable and the replenished sand quickly erodes. If human activity is a major cause of the erosion, mitigating that activity may be more cost effective over both short and long term periods than direct nourishment.|$|E
