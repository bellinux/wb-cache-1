5000|$|Creswell had two railway stations. Creswell & Welbeck (known {{locally as}} Top Station) was opened by the LD&ECR in 1897 and closed in September 1939. Elmton and Creswell (known as <b>Bottom</b> <b>Station)</b> {{was on the}} Midland Railway line running between [...] and [...] The line and station closed in October 1964, leaving the village without a rail service. From 1993 the line was reopened northwards from Nottingham in stages under the name Robin Hood Line.

40|$|Based on year-long cross-correlations of {{broad-band}} seismic records {{obtained at}} sixty-six stations within or {{adjacent to the}} Pacific Basin, we show that broad-band ambient noise is observed to propagate coherently between island stations and between island and continent stations. For many station pairs, high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) fundamental mode Rayleigh wave Green functions are observed, which establishes the physical basis for ambient noise tomography across the Pacific. Similar trends for continental and oceanic stations are observed {{in the relationship between}} the ambient noise level at a 1 station and the “noise coherence distance ” – the longest distance at which a high SNR cross-correlation signal is observed for a station. Because locally generated noise obscures long distance coherent noise, situating stations at quiet locations on islands is necessary for the success of ambient noise tomography. Local noise poses a particular challenge at atoll sites and, on the basis of analysis of data from station H 2 O, at ocean bottom sites at periods above ~ 25 sec. Reducing long-period (> 20 sec) local noise caused by tilts and subsurface deformation on ocean <b>bottom</b> <b>stations</b> by using horizontal components and differential pressure meters is recommended to improve the suitability of ocean <b>bottom</b> <b>stations</b> for ambient noise tomography...|$|R
50|$|There {{originally}} was no <b>bottom</b> <b>station,</b> passengers {{stepped into the}} tramcars directly from the pavement as the control equipment was incorporated in the upper station and no station was provided {{at the bottom of}} the lift. Fares are paid at the top station.|$|E
50|$|The Green Track {{was built}} in 1988 and was a welcome {{addition}} because it reduced the queuing times and provided an opportunity for younger children and families to enjoy the ride.

50|$|The {{original}} town of Peach Bottom {{was located}} {{across the river}} in York County. With {{the construction of the}} Columbia and Port Deposit Railroad up {{the east side of the}} Susquehanna (1866-1868), a station was built on the Lancaster County side, near the mouth of Peters Creek, from which Peach Bottom could be reached by ferry. This was known as Peach <b>Bottom</b> <b>Station.</b>|$|E
50|$|Originally {{the railway}} was {{powered by a}} simple system using water and gravity.
