30|$|Since our {{simulation}} results {{are based on}} the very poor performance of the Eastern Germany labour market since reunification, we have also analysed an alternative scenario {{based on the assumption that}} future employment careers of younger <b>birth</b> <b>cohorts</b> follow the average trend over all cohorts in our observation period. This assumption implies that the future careers of younger <b>birth</b> <b>cohorts</b> improve markedly relative to those of older <b>birth</b> <b>cohorts</b> to compensate for the large difference in unemployment already cumulated by younger <b>birth</b> <b>cohorts</b> at the end of the observation period. In this scenario, the strong employment decline and dramatic increase in cumulated unemployment among younger <b>birth</b> <b>cohorts</b> would be significantly dampened although not fully compensated. This more optimistic scenario would not only require a substantial overall improvement of the East German labour market but also an improvement of future employment careers of younger <b>birth</b> <b>cohorts</b> relative to those of older cohorts. This does not seem very likely, given that the high level of long-term unemployment accumulated since reunification may well have negative effects on future employment careers.|$|R

25|$|In their {{review of}} data from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (a {{longitudinal}} <b>birth</b> <b>cohort</b> study; n = 941) Moffitt et al. report that while men exhibit more aggression overall, gender is not a reliable predictor of interpersonal aggression, including psychological aggression. The study found that whether male or female, aggressive people share a cluster of traits, including high rates of suspicion and jealousy; sudden and drastic mood swings; poor self-control; and higher than average rates of approval of violence and aggression (in American society, females are, on average, approved of violence against males). Moffitt et al. also argue that antisocial men exhibit two distinct types of interpersonal aggression (one against strangers, the other against intimate female partners), while antisocial women are rarely aggressive against anyone other than intimate male partners.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} before, {{these results}} of increased proportions of people seropositive for the parasite {{in cases of}} these neurological disorders do not necessarily indicate a causal relationship between the infection and disorder. It {{is also important to}} mention that in 2016 a population-representative <b>birth</b> <b>cohort</b> study which was done, to test a hypothesis that toxoplasmosis is related to impairment in brain and behaviour measured by a range of phenotypes including neuropsychiatric disorders, poor impulse control, personality and neurocognitive deficits. The results of this study did not support the results in the previously mentioned studies, more than marginally. None of the P-values showed significance for any outcome measure. Thus, according to this study, the presence of T. gondii antibodies is not correlated to increase susceptibility to any of the behaviour phenotypes (except possibly to a higher rate of unsuccessful attempted suicide). This team did not observe any significant association between T. gondii serpositivity and schizophrenia. The team notes that the null findings might be a false negative due to low statistical power because of small sample sizes, but against this weights that their set-up should avoid some possibilities for errors in the about 40 studies that did show a positive correlation. They conclude that further studies should be performed.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} impact of {{changing}} employment patterns and pension reforms on the future level of public pensions across <b>birth</b> <b>cohorts</b> in Germany. The analysis {{is based on a}} microsimulation model which accounts for cohort effects in individual employment and unemployment and earnings over the lifecycle as well as the differential impact of recent pension reforms on <b>birth</b> <b>cohorts.</b> Cohort effects estimated on the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) for for individuals born between 1937 and 1971 vary greatly by region, gender and education and strongly affect lifecycle wage profiles, in particular in East Germany and for people with little education. Using simulated life cycle employment and income profiles, we project gross future pensions across cohorts taking into account changing demographics and recent pension reforms. Simulations show that pension levels for East German men and women will fall dramatically among younger <b>birth</b> <b>cohorts,</b> not only because of policy reforms but due to higher cumulated unemployment. For West German men, the small reduction of average pension levels among younger <b>birth</b> <b>cohorts</b> is mainly driven by {{the impact of}} pension reforms, while future pension levels of West German women are increasing or stable due to rising labor market participation of younger <b>birth</b> <b>cohorts...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} and quantify {{the differences in}} risk behaviours, HIV prevalence and incidence rates by <b>birth</b> <b>cohorts</b> {{among a group of}} women in Durban, South Africa. Methods: Cross-sectional and prospective cohort analyses were conducted for women who consented to be screened and enrolled in an HIV prevention trial. Demographic and sexual behaviours were described by five-year <b>birth</b> <b>cohorts.</b> Semiparametric regression models were used to investigate the bivariate associations between these factors and the <b>birth</b> <b>cohorts.</b> HIV seroconversion rates were also estimated by <b>birth</b> <b>cohorts.</b> Results: The prevalence of HIV- 1 infection at the screening visit was lowest (20. 0 %) among the oldest (born before 1960) cohorts, while the highest prevalence was observed among those born between 1975 and 79. Level of education increased across the <b>birth</b> <b>cohorts</b> while the median age at first sexual experience declined among those born after 1975 compared to those born before 1975. Only 33. 03 % of the oldest group reported ever using a condom while engaging in vaginal sex compared to 73. 68 % in the youngest group; however, HIV and other sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence rates were significantly higher among younger women compared to older women. Conclusions: These findings clearly suggest that demographic and sexual risk behaviours are differentially related to the <b>birth</b> <b>cohorts.</b> Significantly high HIV and STI incidence rates were observed among the younger group. Although the level of education increased, early age at sexual debut was more common among the younger group. The continuing increase in HIV and STI incidence rates among the later cohorts suggests that the future trajectory of the epidemic will be dependent on the infection patterns in younger <b>birth</b> <b>cohorts...</b>|$|R

The aim of the present work is to provide the stepwise proceedings of the development and current version of the harmonized MeDALL-Core Questionnaire (MeDALL-CQ) used prospectively in 11 European <b>birth</b> <b>cohorts.</b> Methods: The harmonization of questions was accomplished in 4 steps: (i) collection of variables from 14 <b>birth</b> <b>cohorts,</b> (ii) consensus on questionnaire items, (iii) translation and back-translation of the harmonized English MeDALL-CQ into 8 other languages and (iv) implementation of the harmonized follow-up. Results: Three harmonized MeDALL-CQs (2 for parents of children aged 4 - 9 and 14 - 18, 1 for adolescents aged 14 - 18) were developed and used for a harmonized follow-up assessment of 11 European <b>birth</b> <b>cohorts</b> on asthma and allergies with over 13, 000 children. Conclusions: The harmonized MeDALL follow-up produced more comparable data across different cohorts and countries in Europe and will offer the possibility to verify results of former cohort analyses.
