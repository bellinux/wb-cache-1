40|$|To improve {{yarn quality}} in ring {{spinning}} frame, this paper examines transposal spinning with the movable <b>balloon</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring.</b> The left-transposal spinning and the right-transposal spinning were experimented to spin two yarns; after installing the movable <b>balloon</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring,</b> the two methods were respectively used to spin two other yarns again. All the experiments {{were on the}} same ring frame and the raw material was wool/polyester blend roving with a ration of 30 / 70. The main quality indexes of the four yarns were tested and analyzed, including hairiness, tensile property, evenness and usual faults. The results show that the yarn spun by the left-transposal spinning has a better quality than the right-transposal spinning, and after adding the movable <b>balloon</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring,</b> the improvement of yarn hairiness strength and evenness, as well usual faults, is very obvious. So, in the advantage of transposal spinning, the method of installing the movable <b>balloon</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> can improve some deteriorative problems and make yarn quality better. In addition, the method gives new insight into energy efficiency. The research in this field in on the way and the result is in accord with the Low-carbon Economy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Compared {{to other}} {{spinning}} system, the ring spinning {{process has been}} used to produce higher quality yarns, but with a much lower spinning efficiency, resulted from the relatively high spinning tension that leads to increased yarn breakage rates and makes high power consumption. Thus, depressing yarn tension is essential to change the status. In this paper, we design a movable balloon controller system to reduce yarn tension. The system is automatic, composed of powder switch, touch screen, PLC (Programmable Logic Controller), pulling-thread displacement sensor, controller of step motor, step motor and linear module. PLC, the core of the system, controls the position of the balloon controller by a series of programs. Then yarn tension was tested while spinning with movable <b>balloon</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring,</b> fixed <b>balloon</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> and no <b>balloon</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring,</b> respectively. The result shows that the yarn tension can be depressed indeed by equipping this movable balloon controller system to some extent. Additionally, we find that the number of hairiness of ring spun yarns with this system can be reduced to some extent, while yarn tensile properties are not as sensitive to be worse. It is significant to cut down ends-down rate, improve the quality of ring spun yarns, the spinning efficiency as well as the energy efficiency of ring spinning...|$|E
40|$|The ring {{spinning}} {{process has been}} used to produce fine and high quality staple fibre yarns. The stability of the rotating yarn loop (i. e. balloon) between the yarn-guide and the traveller-ring is crucial to the success and economics of this process. Balloon control rings are used to contain the yarn-loop, by reducing the yarn tension and decreasing the balloon flutter instability. Flutter instability here refers to the uncontrolled changes in a ballooning yarn under dynamic forces, including the air drag. Due to the significant variation in the length and radius of the balloon during the bobbin filling process, the optimal location for the <b>balloon</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> is not easily determined. In order to address this difficulty, this study investigates the variation in the radius of a free balloon and examines the effect of balloon control rings of various diameters at different locations on yarn tension and balloon flutter stability. The results indicate that the maximum radius of a free balloon and its corresponding position depend not only on the yarn-length to balloon-height ratio, but also on yarn type and count. A control ring of suitable radius and position can significantly reduce yarn tension and decrease flutter instability of free single-loop balloons. While the balloon control rings are usually fixed to, and move in sinc with, the ring frame, results reported in this study suggest that theoretically, a <b>balloon</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> that always remains approximately half way between the yarn-guide and the ring rail du{{ring spinning}} can lead to significant reduction in yarn tension. <br /...|$|E

40|$|With the {{increasing}} interest in decreasing {{the environmental impact}} from internal combustion engines as well as increasing the fuel efficiency has led to deeper investigation into {{the components of the}} engine. The mechanical friction in an engine is a major concern, any improvements or reductions in friction can have large implication on the' efficiency of the engines. This thesis focuses on the piston/ ring pack assembly and its contribution to friction. It investigates several key components and trends in friction for the piston/ ring pack assembly, specifically the trends related to the oil <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> and the liner surface. The Floating Liner Engine is used in this study to isolate results from different components. The data collected can be used for comparative analysis and to identify trends in the friction trace. The thesis starts with describing the Floating Liner Engine system at MIT in detail. Both the data collection and the hardware systems are described as well as the test capabilities of the Floating Liner Engine. The results used in the thesis have been collected using the motoring condition. The oil <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> {{plays a key role in}} controlling the supply of oil to the top two rings and hence has a higher tension that the top two rings. This leads to the oil <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> having a significant contribution to the total friction of the system. The two most prevalent oil <b>control</b> <b>rings</b> used in the industry are the twin land oil <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> (TLOCR) and the three piece oil <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> (TPOCR). The thesis investigates the effect of changing liner roughness on the friction of the TLOCR. A comparison between the TLOCR and the TPOCR is also performed using the same liner surfaces. The results from these studies show a marked difference between the friction traces from the two oil <b>control</b> <b>rings.</b> by Sarthak Vaish. Thesis: S.

40|$|Twin-land oil <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> {{is widely}} used in the {{automotive}} diesel engines, and is gaining more and more applications in the modern designs of gasoline engines. Its interaction with the cylinder liner surface accounts for around 10 % of the total frictional losses within an internal combustion engine, and {{is the most important}} factor that affects the lubricant oil consumption. A twin-land oil <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> model is developed based on the deterministic hydrodynamic method by Li et al. [31] and the Greenwood Tripp asperity contact model [39]. Unlike the traditional methods of piston ring pack modeling determined by the ring face macro profile which hardly exists on the twin-land oil <b>control</b> <b>ring,</b> the model considers the liner finish micro geometry, and uses a correlation method to predict the behavior of the ring liner interaction in both frictions losses and oil control. The model is used to study the effect of some key design parameters of the twin-land oil <b>control</b> <b>ring,</b> including the unit load pressure, the ring tension and the ring axial land width. The results show a large potential of the model in the optimization of the twin-land oil <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> design. Although many non-conventional cylinder liner finishes are now being developed to reduce friction and oil consumption, the effects of surface finish on ring-pack performance is not well understood. To solver this mystery, the twin-land oil <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> model and Li's deterministic hydrodynamic model are used to study the effect of the liner finish micro geometry. Several key parameters of liner finish texture are examined, and the analytical results show important effects of some of these key parameters on the twin-land oil <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> friction losses as well as the lubricant oil control. (cont.) These key parameters include the surface wavelength of the plateau part, the frequency of deep valleys and the honing cross-hatch angle.

40|$|Piston ring {{friction}} losses account for approximately 20 % {{of the total}} mechanical losses in modern internal combustion engines. A reduction in piston ring friction would therefore result in higher efficiency, lower fuel consumption and reduced emissions. The goal {{of this study was}} to develop low-friction piston ring designs to improve engine efficiency, without adversely affecting oil consumption, blowby, wear, or cost. These are desirable objectives for today's engine manufacturers as they strive to improve engine performance while trying to meet increasingly stringent emissions regulations. Using an existing piston ring friction and lubrication model, the main contributors to friction in modern internal combustion engines were identified as the top ring around top dead center of the compression/expansion strokes and the oil <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> throughout the engine cycle. Model predictions indicated that the top ring friction could be reduced by implementing a skewed barrel profile design or an upward piston groove tilt design, and oil <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> friction could be reduced by decreasing ring tension. An increase in groove wear was predicted to occur with the upward piston groove tilt design, which could be eliminated by the introduction of a positive static twist on the top ring. An increase in oil consumption was predicted to occur with the low-tension oil <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> design, which could be mitigated either by the introduction of a negative static twist on the second ring, or by the implementation of the skewed barrel top ring design. Model predictions indicated that by combining the low-friction designs, a reduction in piston ring pack friction of 30 - 35 % could be achieved, without an increase in blowby, wear, or oil consumption. (cont.) Experimental results conducted on a full-scale natural gas power generation engine supported the model predictions for the low-tension oil <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> design. The predicted reduction in piston ring friction would translate to a 0. 5 - 1 % increase in brake thermal efficiency, which would result in a significant improvement in fuel economy and a substantial reduction in emissions over the life of the engine. by Grant Smedley.

40|$|To {{assess whether}} aortic vessels of rats with {{cirrhosis}} and ascites possess an enhanced vascular response to endothelium-derived, nitric oxide-dependent vasodilators, we performed relaxation studies in isolated aortic <b>rings</b> of 21 <b>control</b> rats and 24 rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis and ascites. We carried out studies after contracting the vessels with norepinephrine. We measured endothelium-dependent vasodilator response by administering increasing concentrations of acetylcholine (10 (- 6) to 10 (- 2) mol/L) and ADP (10 (- 7) to 10 (- 4) mol/L). We evaluated endothelium-independent response by giving increased concentration of sodium nitrite (10 (- 5) to 10 (- 2) mol/L). The maximal absolute tension developed {{in response to}} norepinephrine was significantly decreased in cirrhotic rings (816 +/- 72 mg, p < 0. 025) compared with control (1, 425 +/- 75 mg) rings. Dose-response curves for endothelium-dependent vasodilators were shifted to the left in aortic rings of cirrhotic rats, and EC 50 for acetylcholine and ADP were significantly decreased in cirrhotic (0. 8 +/- 0. 15 mmol/L and 0. 42 +/- 0. 16 mumol/L, p < 0. 025 and p < 0. 01, respectively) than in <b>control</b> <b>rings</b> (1. 91 +/- 0. 33 mmol/L and 3. 09 +/- 0. 82 mumol/L).
