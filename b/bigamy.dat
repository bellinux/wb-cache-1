5|$|To {{resolve the}} {{possibility}} of his <b>bigamy</b> being exposed, Minnie pushed Brinkley to file for divorce from Sally, which he did in December 1915. To prevent the court from inquiring of Sally directly, he wrote {{that they had been}} married in New York City, and {{that he did not know}} her current place of residence. The divorce was finalized on February 21, 1916. Four days later, Minnie and Brinkley were married again, this time in Liberty, Missouri. Brinkley had not waited the required six months from divorce to subsequent remarriage.|$|E
5|$|At one time, some dynasties adhered {{strictly}} {{to the concept}} of royal intermarriage. The Bernadottes, Habsburgs, Sicilian and Spanish Bourbons and Romanovs, among others, introduced house laws which governed dynastic marriages; it was considered important that dynasts marry social equals (i.e., other royalty), thereby ruling out even the highest-born non-royal nobles. Those dynasts who contracted undesirable marriages often did so morganatically. Generally, this is a marriage between a man of high birth and a woman of lesser status (such as a daughter of a low-ranked noble family or a commoner). Usually, neither the bride nor any children of the marriage has a claim on the bridegroom's succession rights, titles, precedence, or entailed property. The children are considered legitimate for all other purposes and the prohibition against <b>bigamy</b> applies.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the male}} and female of the species reach sexual {{maturity}} after 1 year of life. The breeding season occurs in the spring and early summer. The males arrive before {{the beginning of the season}} to establish their territories. The males use a series of courtship displays to attract the females to their sites. They run around the area either to showcase their territory to the females or to pursue the females. The males also engage in flight to showcase their wings. They sing and call as they perform all of these displays. The species can remain monogamous for many years, but incidents of polygyny and <b>bigamy</b> have been reported to occur during the bird's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Yash Raj Films' first release came in 1973 {{with the}} Chopra-directed , a drama about <b>bigamy,</b> {{starring}} Rajesh Khanna, Raakhee and Sharmila Tagore. The company had four more releases in the 1970s, including the family drama Kabhie Kabhie {{and the action}} film Kaala Patthar, both of which starred Amitabh Bachchan. Yash Raj Films' sole commercial success in the 1980s was the Sridevi-starring romance Chandni. The year 1995 marked the directorial debut of Yash Chopra's son, Aditya Chopra, with the highly successful romantic drama Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. Starring Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, the film has the longest theatrical run in Indian cinema history. Other successful releases of the 1990s were Darr (1993) and Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), both starring Khan.|$|E
5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is monogamous, and {{typically}} mates for life. Birds from pairs often engage in extra-pair copulations, so about 15% of house sparrow fledglings are unrelated to their mother's mate. Male house sparrows guard their mates carefully {{to avoid being}} cuckolded, and most extra-pair copulation occurs away from nest sites. Males may sometimes have multiple mates, and <b>bigamy</b> is mostly limited by aggression between females. Many birds do not find a nest and a mate, and instead may serve as helpers around the nest for mated pairs, a role which increases the chances of being chosen to replace a lost mate. Lost mates of both sexes can be replaced quickly during the breeding season. The formation of a pair and the bond between the two birds {{is tied to the}} holding of a nest site, though paired house sparrows can recognise each other away from the nest.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bigamy</b> is the act {{of marrying}} one person while already being married to another, and is legally {{prohibited}} in most countries in which monogamy is the cultural norm. Some <b>bigamy</b> statutes are broad enough to potentially encompass polyamorous relationships involving cohabitation, even if none of the participants claim marriage {{to more than one}} partner.|$|E
25|$|In the U.K, {{there are}} {{believed}} to be up to 20,000 polygamous marriages in Britain's Muslim's community, even though <b>bigamy</b> is an offence.|$|E
25|$|The {{operations}} were against Tobruk (Agreement), Benghazi (<b>Bigamy),</b> Jalo oasis (Nicety) and Barce (Caravan). Caravan {{was the only}} successful operation of the group.|$|E
25|$|An inquisition was {{a process}} that {{developed}} to investigate alleged instances of crimes. Its use in ecclesiastical courts was not at first directed to matters of heresy, but a broad assortment of offenses such as clandestine marriage and <b>bigamy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Romania: <b>Bigamy,</b> {{defined as}} {{marriage}} {{conducted by a}} person which is already married, is punishable by up to 2 years in prison or fine. Knowingly marrying a married person is punishable by up to 1 year in prison or by fine.|$|E
25|$|Scalia {{wrote that}} if the court was not {{prepared}} to validate laws based on moral choices as it had done in Bowers, state laws against <b>bigamy,</b> same-sex marriage, adult incest, prostitution, masturbation, adultery, fornication, bestiality, and obscenity would not prove sustainable.|$|E
25|$|The film {{touched on}} {{the topics of}} gold-digging, adultery, <b>bigamy,</b> gigolos, and theft. The rights to the story were optioned in late 1930, and the film went into {{production}} in March 1931. After approximately four weeks of filming, the film was screened in May.|$|E
25|$|Brazil – A legally {{married person}} or a married couple {{cohabiting}} {{with one or more}} sexual partner(s) is prohibited by law as <b>bigamy,</b> which is punishable by two to six years of imprisonment, and is valid for every Brazilian citizen, including naturalized ones.|$|E
25|$|Belaney had {{relationships}} {{with at least}} five women. He deserted his first wife and child, later committing <b>bigamy</b> by marrying Constance Holmes in England. He had a daughter with his first and third wives, and was known to have fathered a boy as well.|$|E
25|$|In 1876, Reuss married Delphina Garbois from Dublin, {{and moved}} to Munich in 1878. Their {{marriage}} was annulled, due to <b>bigamy</b> (Hergemöller, 1998). They had a son, Albert Franz Theodor Reuss (1879–1958), a self-educated zoologist who lived in Berlin (Krecsák and Bohle 2008).|$|E
25|$|On 13 December 2013, {{a federal}} judge, {{spurred by the}} American Civil Liberties Union and other groups, struck down the parts of Utah's <b>bigamy</b> law that criminalized cohabitation, while also {{acknowledging}} that the state may still enforce bans on having multiple marriage licenses.|$|E
25|$|Under John III, the {{activity}} of the courts was extended to the censure of books, as well as undertaking cases of divination, witchcraft, and <b>bigamy.</b> Originally aimed at religious matters, the Inquisition had an influence on almost every aspect of Portuguese life – political, cultural, and social.|$|E
25|$|In most countries, {{a person}} who marries a person while still being {{lawfully}} married to another commits <b>bigamy.</b> In all such cases, the second marriage is considered legally null and void. Besides the second and subsequent marriages being void, the bigamist is also liable to other penalties, which vary between jurisdictions.|$|E
25|$|Ravenoff {{successfully}} convinces Rita to spurn Ranger Jim on {{the pretext}} that Jim will arrest Roberto. Rita unhappily agrees to marry Ravenoff {{to prevent him}} from exposing Roberto as the Kinkajou. Meanwhile, Wheeler's first wife, Katie (Helen Kaiser), shows up to accuse him of <b>bigamy,</b> but conveniently falls in love with Woolsey.|$|E
25|$|Before the Supreme Court, Reynolds {{argued that}} his {{conviction}} for <b>bigamy</b> should be overturned on four issues: {{that it was}} his religious duty to marry multiple times and the First Amendment protected his practice of his religion; that his grand jury had not been legally constituted; that challenges of certain jurors were improperly overruled; that testimony was not admissible as it was under another indictment.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{recognized}} {{that under the}} First Amendment, the Congress cannot pass a law that prohibits {{the free exercise of}} religion. However it held that the law prohibiting <b>bigamy</b> did not meet that standard. The principle that a person could only be married singly, not plurally, existed since the times of King James I of England in English law, upon which United States law was based.|$|E
25|$|George Reynolds was {{a member}} of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), charged with <b>bigamy</b> under the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act after marrying Amelia Jane Schofield while still married to Mary Ann Tuddenham in Utah Territory. He was {{secretary}} to Brigham Young and presented himself as a test of the federal government's attempt to outlaw polygamy. An earlier conviction was overturned on technical grounds.|$|E
25|$|The LDS Church, {{believing that}} the law unconstitutionally {{deprived}} its members of their First Amendment right to freely practice their religion, chose to ignore the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act at the time. On the other hand, in subsequent years, efforts had been underway to strengthen the anti-bigamy laws. Eventually, amid the efforts to indict the LDS leadership for <b>bigamy,</b> the First Presidency agreed to furnish a defendant in a test case to be brought before the United States Supreme Court to determine {{the constitutionality of the}} anti-bigamy law. Reynolds, a secretary {{in the office of the}} president of the church, agreed to serve as the defendant, then provided the United States Attorney with numerous witnesses who could testify of his being married to two wives, and was indicted for <b>bigamy</b> by a grand jury on October 23, 1874. In 1875, Reynolds was convicted and sentenced to two years hard labor in prison and a fine of five hundred dollars. In 1876 the Utah Territorial Supreme Court upheld the sentence.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, {{the church}} {{received}} increased {{attention from the}} state of Utah when police officer Rodney Holm, a member of the church, was convicted of unlawful sexual conduct with a 16- or 17-year-old and one count of <b>bigamy</b> for his marriage to and impregnation of plural wife Ruth Stubbs. The conviction was the first legal action against a member of the FLDS Church since the Short Creek raid.|$|E
25|$|While Franklin was in London, {{his trip}} was extended, {{and there were}} {{problems}} with Sir William's promises of support. Perhaps because of the circumstances of this delay, Deborah married a man named John Rodgers. This {{proved to be a}} regrettable decision. Rodgers shortly avoided his debts and prosecution by fleeing to Barbados with her dowry, leaving her behind. Rodgers's fate was unknown, and because of <b>bigamy</b> laws, Deborah was not free to remarry.|$|E
25|$|The Testament of Joseph {{primarily}} concerns Chastity, {{and seems}} heavily {{to be based}} on Joseph's resistance against Potiphar's wife that the canonical bible portrays. The narrative contains a large expansion on the attempts of Potiphar's wife to seduce Joseph, portraying her as first threatening Joseph, then employing torture, then flattering Joseph, then plotting to kill her husband so that Joseph would be able to marry her without <b>bigamy,</b> then using love potions, and finally threatening suicide.|$|E
25|$|The Jews of Gibraltar {{initially}} preserved {{some old}} customs. For example, in 1777, Issac Aboab, a Gibraltarian Jew born in Tetuan, {{was listed as}} having two wives, Hannah Aboab and Simah Aboab. <b>Bigamy</b> was illegal in the Kingdom of Great Britain at the time, but the law was apparently not fully operative in Gibraltar, and though polygamy had been banned by Rabbenu Gershom Meor Hagola since approximately 1000 CE, this ban was only accepted by Ashkenazi communities.|$|E
25|$|Rachel Jackson {{was also}} a {{frequent}} target of attacks, and was widely accused of <b>bigamy,</b> {{a reference to the}} controversial situation of her marriage with Jackson. Jackson's campaigners fired back by claiming that while serving as Minister to Russia, Adams had procured a young girl to serve as a prostitute for Emperor Alexander I. They also stated that Adams had a billiard table in the White House and that he had charged the government for it.|$|E
25|$|Kenneth Duremdes married Vanessa Cariaga in 1993 at the Manila City Hall, and the {{ceremony}} was officiated by Reverend Jesus Mesa before witnesses Manolita San Luis and Nora Atienzo. Duremdes contracted a second marriage with Teresa Ibasco in 1996. Cariaga filed a <b>bigamy</b> lawsuit against him. Thereafter, he filed an annulment of marriage case which was later dismissed by a Quezon City regional trial court, Branch 255. The ruling was affirmed on October 21, 2008, by the Philippine Court of Appeals' 9th division.|$|E
25|$|After {{finishing}} the film, Valentino married Rambova, {{which led to}} a <b>bigamy</b> trial. The trial was a sensation and the pair was forced to have their marriage annulled and separated for a year. Despite the trial, the film was still a success, with critics calling it a masterpiece on par with Broken Blossoms and Four Horsemen. Blood and Sand became one of the four top-grossing movies of 1922, breaking attendance records, and grossing $37,400 at the Rivoli Theatre alone. Valentino considered this one of his best films.|$|E
25|$|Mathis {{was also}} one of the people who helped bail Valentino out of jail when he was arrested for <b>bigamy,</b> having married Natacha Rambova without finalizing his divorce to Jean Acker. Though the two were inseparable, their {{relationship}} became strained during Valentino's marriage to Rambova. When Mathis submitted a script for The Hooded Falcon, one of Valentino's pet projects, the couple deemed it unacceptable and asked to have it rewritten. Mathis took it as a great insult and broke off all contact with Valentino.|$|E
25|$|The {{middle section}} of the book details Maclean's first set of {{experiences}} in World War II. He was {{invited to join the}} newly formed Special Air Service (SAS), where, as part of the Western Desert Campaign, he planned and executed raids on Axis-held Benghazi, on the coast of Libya (Operation <b>Bigamy).</b> When {{it became clear that the}} North African Campaign was drawing to a close towards the end of 1942 and it became too quiet for his taste, he travelled east to arrest General Fazlollah Zahedi, at the time the head of the Persian armed forces in the south.|$|E
25|$|This {{death penalty}} was also set for conduct that placed another {{in danger of}} death. The form of death penalty was {{specified}} for the following cases: gibbeting: for burglary (on the spot where crime was committed), later also for encroaching on the king's highway, for getting a slave-brand obliterated, for procuring a husband's death; burning: for incest with own mother, for a vestal entering or opening a tavern, for looting a house on fire (thrown into the fire); drowning: for adultery, rape of a betrothed maiden, <b>bigamy,</b> bad conduct as a wife, seduction of a daughter-in-law.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, {{when the}} {{relationship}} between Ion Antonescu and King Carol II degenerated into open conflict, the monarch engineered Ion Antonescu's trial for <b>bigamy,</b> based on charges that she and Fueller had never actually divorced. Assisted by his lawyer Mihai Antonescu, the future Conducător disproved the claim, and the perception {{that he was being}} persecuted by an authoritarian ruler reportedly earned him the public's respect. By then, although the officer spoke out against Carol II's extramarital affair with the commoner Elena Lupescu, his own marriage to a divorcée was being treated with contempt by some commentators of the time.|$|E
25|$|Luther {{had been}} {{suffering}} from ill health for years, including Ménière's disease, vertigo, fainting, tinnitus, and a cataract in one eye. From 1531 to 1546 his health deteriorated further. The years of struggle with Rome, the antagonisms with and among his fellow reformers, and the scandal that ensued from the <b>bigamy</b> of the Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse incident, in which Luther had played a leading role, all may have contributed. In 1536, he began to suffer from kidney and bladder stones, arthritis, and an ear infection ruptured an ear drum. In December 1544, {{he began to feel}} the effects of angina.|$|E
25|$|Before the 20th century, {{adultery}} {{was often}} punished harshly. In Scandinavia, in the 17th century, adultery and <b>bigamy</b> {{were subject to}} the death penalty, although few people were actually executed. Examples {{of women who have}} been executed for adultery in Medieval and Early Modern Europe include Maria of Brabant, Duchess of Bavaria (in 1256), Agnese Visconti (in 1391), Beatrice Lascaris di Tenda (in 1418), Anne Boleyn (in 1536), and Catherine Howard (in 1542). The enforcement of adultery laws varied by jurisdiction. In England, the last execution for adultery is believed to have taken place in 1654, when a woman named Susan Bounty was hanged.|$|E
