5|$|After {{the loss}} of these two railway {{executive}} positions, Beauregard spent time <b>briefly</b> <b>at</b> a variety of companies and civil engineering pursuits, but his personal wealth became assured when he was recruited as a supervisor of the Louisiana Lottery in 1877. He and former Confederate general Jubal Early presided over lottery drawings and made numerous public appearances, lending the effort some respectability. For 15 years the two generals served in these positions, but the public became opposed to government-sponsored gambling and the lottery was closed down by the legislature.|$|E
5|$|Another {{attempt was}} made to collect a {{specimen}} by Lord Crawford on his yacht Valhalla in 1905. A final {{attempt was made}} during the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition, which passed by in April 1922 on its way back to Britain. This visit also failed, but members of the expedition left collecting material with a Rev. H. M. C. Rogers, then chaplain on Tristan da Cunha. The following year two study skins arrived in the Natural History Museum, London, followed soon after by another skin and a specimen in spirits. Physician Percy Lowe was then able to use the skins to describe the species. He did so, <b>briefly,</b> <b>at</b> a meeting of the British Ornithologists' Club, in 1923.|$|E

5|$|Estre {{was issued}} with a drive-through penalty {{after he was}} adjudged to have caused the {{collision}} between himself and Tandy. Tandy stopped his Porsche <b>briefly</b> <b>at</b> the pit lane entry, while Bonanomi went wide driving up to Radallion corner battling Wurz for sixth. The incident involving Hartley handed the No. 17 Porsche a 15-second, stop-and-go penalty as he was deemed not to have respected track limits and causing danger to marshals. Bernhard took the penalty on the 17th lap, promoting teammate Jani to the lead. Evans moved {{to the front of}} the LMP2 field after overtaking Canal heading into the Bus Stop chicane. Fässler ceded third position to Duval at Les Combes corner.|$|E
5|$|On leaving Holloway, Davison {{became a}} live-in governess, and {{continued}} studying in the evenings. She saved {{enough money to}} enrol at St Hugh's College, Oxford, for one term to sit her finals; she achieved first-class honours in English, but could not graduate because degrees from Oxford were closed to women. She worked <b>briefly</b> <b>at</b> a church school in Edgbaston between 1895 and 1896, but found it difficult and moved to Seabury, a private school in Worthing, where she was more settled; she left the town in 1898 and became a private tutor and governess to a family in Northamptonshire. In 1902 she began reading for a degree at the University of London; she graduated with third-class honours in 1908.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the KGB general {{set up by}} Koskov was to be General Gogol; however, Walter Gotell was {{too sick}} to handle the major role, and the {{character}} of Leonid Pushkin replaced Gogol, who appears <b>briefly</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of the}} film, having transferred to the Soviet diplomatic service. This was Gogol's final appearance in a James Bond film. Morten Harket, the lead vocalist of the Norwegian rock group A-ha (which performed the film's title song), was offered a small role as a villain's henchman in the film, but declined, because of lack of time and because he felt they wanted to cast him due to his popularity rather than his acting.|$|E

5|$|Simcoe County Road90 is two lanes wide between McKinnon Road, {{north of}} Angus, and Ferndale Drive in Barrie, {{although}} a passing lane is provided for eastbound traffic between Angus and Essa. The road also widens to four lanes <b>briefly</b> <b>at</b> the junction with former Highway131 west of Barrie, {{as well as}} within the city and within Angus. The land use surrounding the route is mixed, with pastures and forests composing {{the majority of the}} setting. Residences and small businesses are also scattered throughout the length of the route.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently visiting Boston, and Rockland, Maine, Yancey {{participated in}} amphibious boat {{exercises}} at Provincetown, Massachusetts, {{before she got}} underway on 24 July for Davisville, Rhode Island. There, she loaded a Seabee unit and their equipment and headed eastward, bound for Rota, Spain. Offloading one Seabee unit and onloading another, Yancey then paused <b>briefly</b> <b>at</b> Gibraltar before touching at Lisbon on the return leg of her voyage to the United States. Disembarking the seabees and unloading their equipment at Davisville, Yancey headed back to Norfolk, reaching her homeport on 18 August 1962.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} {{spent the}} next several months in training at locations about the central North Island before embarking for New Caledonia in December. Arriving at Nouméa on 31 December 1942, the battalion was earmarked to be the basis for a new brigade, the 15th. However this proved to be only a short-term measure and by March 1943, it was back with 14th Brigade. While on New Caledonia, the battalion underwent jungle training and performed security duties before departing for Guadalcanal in mid-August 1943. After stopping <b>briefly</b> <b>at</b> the New Hebrides, it arrived at Guadalcanal on 27 August and spent a month here, establishing camps and conducting patrols to monitor for any surprise landings by the Japanese.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} of the episode, originally scheduled for January 1990, was moved to December 1989 to accommodate the filming availability of Crosby and Whoopi Goldberg, who played Guinan. The task of writing and polishing the new treatment in half the time fell upon writer Ronald D. Moore, who submitted his first draft on November 9. Moore's script removed the alien probe and made the alternate universe militaristic, with the Federation and the Klingons at war. Some characters, such as Troi, appeared only <b>briefly</b> <b>at</b> {{the beginning of the}} episode to allow more screen time for the guest characters. The beat sheet for the episode, which detailed characters and scenes, was distributed on November 27.|$|E
5|$|Theobald's {{household}} {{included many}} young men of ability, including his successor Thomas Becket. Theobald {{was instrumental in the}} early spread of Roman law to England, inviting the Bologna-schooled jurist Vacarius to join his administration and advise on legal matters. Whether Vacarius actually started a school in Theobald's household is unclear, but in the 1140s he taught <b>briefly</b> <b>at</b> Oxford. Theobald was instrumental in fostering the teaching of canon law in England; the conflict that later arose between Henry II and Thomas Becket had its roots in disputes that were exposed during Theobald's time in office. While still in Normandy, Theobald had made an intense study of ecclesiastical or canon law, which he continued after being elected archbishop.|$|E
5|$|They {{asked him}} to leave because they were uncomfortable about sexual remarks he had made to young female members of the family.

He became well-known locally and was a regular patron of the Shamrock Cafe on Stratford Road and of the Rainbow pub in Digbeth, where he was employed on a casual basis as an odd-jobber and served as an unofficial taxi driver for drinkers.|$|E
