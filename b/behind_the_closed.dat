25|$|Raymond {{tells of}} the words he heard Sir Ackroyd say <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> door at 9.30 and Blunt also says he heard the words when he was walking on the terrace but his {{attention}} was caught {{by the sight of}} a woman in white just passing behind a hedge in the garden. Flora tells of seeing her uncle at 9.45 and she and Parker recreate what happened for Poirot. Bourne is summoned and questioned if she was the woman who Blunt saw and she confirms that she was going out to post a letter in the box by the gate. The others retire to bed and Poirot sits and smokes in the semi-darkness, looking at the dead body of Sir Roger and thinking...|$|E
25|$|Poirot has had Sheppard and Caryl round for dinner. They {{are expecting}} further guests as Poirot {{has asked the}} {{household}} from Fernley to call round but his first visitor is Bourne, panicked over a newspaper report that Poirot asked Davies to insert claiming that Ralph had been arrested in Liverpool. This forces Bourne {{to admit that she}} and Ralph are married. She had confessed this to Sir Roger and he had dismissed her. Ralph came to Fernley after an urgent telegram from her but she insists they only met in the summerhouse for ten minutes and then she left him there. Poirot wants her to join the others when they arrive and Caryl insists that the former maid can stay the night at their house. She goes to make arrangements as the party from Fernley arrives. Poirot asks them to sit down as he addresses them and he first reveals Bourne's marriage to Ralph. However the time when the two people met in the summerhouse coincided with the time that Sir Roger's voice was heard <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> study door. They are therefore all puzzled as to who was with him but Poirot has another idea – no one was with him: the formal words that Ackroyd were using were intended for the Dictaphone. This creates problems for Ralph as his alibi for the time is now useless and Raymond thinks the young man should come forward and explain himself. Poirot agrees and opens the curtains to the conservatory, revealing Ralph. Poirot guessed that Sheppard met him that night, knowing that he had gone to the inn where he was staying, and had then hidden him. Poirot further deduced that a doctor would hide someone in a nursing home, hence his questions to Caryl. Ralph’s alibi is now useless and Poirot tells the assembled group that to save him the real murderer – {{who is one of the}} people in the room – must confess. They have until midday tomorrow and then Poirot will go to the police.|$|E

She later compared the episode to live theater, which she had worked in previously. The four acts of [...] "Triangle" [...] were filmed in several continuous shots, and edited together to give the impression of four seamless acts. This included the scenes in the FBI; when the actors entered the stage elevator, the set that they would next move onto had to be constructed <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> doors. Many times during filming, these doors would open before the set behind had been completed, which ruined the shot.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of April 4, 1958, after the Oscar {{telecast}} which she had attended without him, Stompanato arrived at Turner's rented house at 730 North Bedford Drive in Beverly Hills. The two began arguing heatedly in the bedroom, during which Stompanato threatened to kill Turner, her daughter, and her mother. Fearing that her mother's life was in danger, Turner's fourteen-year-old daughter, Cheryl, grabbed a kitchen knife and ran to Turner's defense. According to testimony provided by Turner at the coroner's inquest, Cheryl, who had {{been listening to the}} couple's fight <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> door, stabbed Stompanato in the stomach when Turner attempted to usher him out of the bedroom. [...] " [...] I thought [...] hit him in the stomach," [...] Turner testified in court. The killing was ultimately deemed a justifiable homicide.|$|E

2500|$|The {{accident}} {{was determined to}} {{have been caused by}} a closed [...] "angle cock", a valve on the front and rear of all locomotives and rail cars used in the train's airbrake system, on the rear of the third car in the train. The handle of the angle cock had been improperly placed and had contacted the bottom of the car. Once it was closed the air brake pipe on all the cars <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> valve remained at full pressure, keeping the brakes released on those cars while the brakes on the locomotive and first three cars were applied in emergency.|$|E
2500|$|The {{air brake}} can fail {{if one of}} the cocks where the pipes of each {{carriage}} are joined together is accidentally closed. In this case, the brakes on the wagons <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> cock will fail to respond to the driver's command. This happened in the 1953 Pennsylvania Railroad train wreck to the Federal Express, a Pennsylvania Railroad train which became runaway while heading into Washington DC's Union Station, causing the train to crash into the passenger concourse and fall through the floor. [...] Similarly, in the Gare de Lyon train accident, a valve was accidentally closed by the crew, reducing braking power.|$|E

[...] They were welcomed by Barton S. Tibbits, and then ushered into the seating area. [...] <b>Behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> curtain, actors and crew waited to present Maid of Arran.

(This was how Payumu's prayer was recorded by Padre Lapus for posterity). The impatient Spanish lieutenant barked: “Puñeta! Todo esto lo que haces es ya de masiado! Levantate!” (Goddammit! This is all simply getting too much! Stand up!). Knowing no Spanish, Duman remained kneeling down and was weeping in utter hopelessness feeling abandoned to certain death by the Apu. [...] Without warning, a local soldier grabbed his arm and forcefully pulled him up, yelling: “Puta naida mo! Ticdo na ca canu! Panaca ning alte! (Son of a bitch! Stand up now! You thunderstrucked!). Losing his balance, Duman fell to the ground. The guards pulled him up and brusquely pushed him forward to the execution spot, which was the corner church wall before reaching the present sacristy door.|$|E

50|$|As closers {{were reduced}} to one-inning specialists, setup men became more prominent. Setup {{pitchers}} often come into the game with the team losing or the game tied. They are usually the second best relief pitcher on a team, <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>closer.</b> After closers became one-inning pitchers, primarily in the ninth inning, setup pitchers became more highly valued. A pitcher who succeeds in this role is often promoted to a closer. Setup men are paid less than closers and mostly make less than the average Major League salary.|$|R
