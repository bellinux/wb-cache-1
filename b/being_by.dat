5|$|A {{transport}} fleet {{protected by}} warships was organised; sixty ships sailed in all.

5|$|Following the {{recapture}} 5.cxd5, Black has {{an eccentric}} option in 5...Bd6, the Snake Benoni. But most players prefer 5...d6, which stops White's d-pawn from advancing to d6. Black's {{control over the}} central dark squares d4 and e5 will then be augmented by fianchettoing the bishop on g7. Meanwhile, White must {{decide whether or not}} to play 6.e4. Although this move gains space in the centre, it also gives Black a target of attack on the half-open e-file. White can deny Black this target for the time <b>being</b> <b>by</b> playing 6.Nf3 first.|$|E
5|$|The 2015 Bears {{were more}} {{competitive}} in games {{compared to the}} 2014 team, with six of their ten losses <b>being</b> <b>by</b> less than a touchdown. Additionally, new coordinators Adam Gase and Vic Fangio helped revitalize the offense and defense, respectively; under Gase, quarterback Jay Cutler threw a career-low eleven interceptions and recorded a 92.3 passer rating, the highest in his career. With Fangio, the defense allowed 397 points; the last two defenses had previously allowed franchise highs in points, including 442 in 2014. However, the team was marred by injuries during the year, with only four players starting all sixteen games. The Bears also went 1–7 at home in 2015, the worst home record in franchise history.|$|E
5|$|The Amtrak {{ticket office}} was closed in April 2001 {{as part of}} {{austerity}} measures. Vandalism also forced the closure of elevators. The same year, SEPTA proposed closing the station because it served few inbound commuters. However, advocacy from the Delaware Valley Association of Rail Passengers, which showed that the station was more heavily used by commuters from the Chestnut Hill West Line changing to SEPTA Trenton Line trains and Amtrak Clockers to Trenton and New York, succeeded in persuading SEPTA to keep the station open for the time <b>being.</b> <b>By</b> 2005, no official decision {{had been made to}} permanently keep the station, but SEPTA planned repairs to the deteriorated platforms.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} Age, the Age of Eden, the player learns a mysterious entity is {{controlling}} the world's other lifeforms and sending {{them against the}} player. This entity {{turns out to be}} Bolbox, a lifeform that has evolved into a freakish and evil advanced <b>being</b> <b>by</b> consuming the crystals, believing itself to be the first human, but in reality is a gigantic single-celled organism. In the game's final battle, the player and Bolbox fight to determine who will gain entry into Eden and become Gaia's partner. Bolbox is defeated, and the player joins Gaia in Eden and is granted the gift of intelligence. It is also revealed the crystals were introduced to Earth by an advanced civilization on Mars, who misguidedly wished to help Earth by speeding its evolution with the crystals. Upon realizing the dangers the crystals create, the Martians decide to leave Earth alone and observe until it becomes advanced enough for them to interact with.|$|E

5|$|Indo-European {{parallels}} {{have been}} proposed between myths of Fenrir and the Persian demon Ahriman. The Yashts refer to a story where Taxma Urupi rode Angra Mainyu as a horse for thirty years. An elaboration of this allusion is found only in a late Parsi commentary. The ruler Taxmoruw (Taxma Urupi) managed to lasso Ahriman (Angra Mainyu) and keep him tied up while taking him for a ride three times a day. After thirty years Ahriman outwitted and swallowed Taxmoruw. In a sexual encounter with Ahriman, Jamshid, Taxmoruw's brother, inserted his hand into Ahriman's anus and pulled out his brother's corpse. His hand withered from contact with the diabolic innards. The suggested parallels with Fenrir myths are the binding of an evil <b>being</b> <b>by</b> a ruler figure and the subsequent swallowing of the ruler figure by the evil being (Odin and Fenrir), trickery involving the thrusting of a hand into a monster's orifice and the affliction of the inserted limb (Týr and Fenrir).|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas feature {{prominently}} in the rituals of certain African cultures. In the Gelede cult of the Yoruba people of Benin and Southwest Nigeria, a spotted hyena mask is used at dawn to signal {{the end of the}} èfè ceremony. As the spotted hyena usually finishes the meals of other carnivores, the animal is associated with the conclusion of all things. Among the Korè cult of the Bambara people in Mali, the belief that spotted hyenas are hermaphrodites appears as an ideal in-between in the ritual domain. The role of the spotted hyena mask in their rituals is often to turn the neophyte into a complete moral <b>being</b> <b>by</b> integrating his male principles with femininity. The Beng people believe that upon finding a freshly killed hyena with its anus inverted, one must plug it back in, for fear of being struck down with perpetual laughter. They also view spotted hyena faeces as contaminating, and will evacuate a village if a hyena relieves itself within village boundaries. In Harar, Ethiopia, spotted hyenas are regularly fed by the city's inhabitants, who believe the hyenas' presence keeps devils at bay, and associate mystical properties such as fortune telling to them.|$|E
