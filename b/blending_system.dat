5|$|Being Naughty Dog's first PlayStation 3 game, {{the project}} {{required}} {{the company to}} familiarize themselves with the new hardware, and resulted in several development mistakes. The switch from developing for the PlayStation 2 to the PlayStation 3 prompted the staff to implement changes to their development technology. Naughty Dog switched to the industry standard language C++ in order to participate in technology sharing among Sony's first-party developers—the company had previously used their own proprietary programming language GOAL, a Lisp-based language. In rewriting their game code, they decided to create new programming tools as well. This switch, however, delayed the team's progress in developing a prototype, as the new tools proved to be unreliable and too difficult to use. Ten months into full production, the team decided to recreate the game's pipeline, the chain of processing elements designed to progress data through a system. In retrospect, Naughty Dog's Co-President Evan Wells considered this the greatest improvement to the project. Additionally, the animation <b>blending</b> <b>system</b> was rewritten several times to obtain the desired character animations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The cure behaviors, {{dielectric}} {{characteristics and}} fracture toughness of diglycidylether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) /poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) <b>blend</b> <b>system</b> were investigated. The degree of conversion for the DGEBA/PET <b>blend</b> <b>system</b> {{was measured using}} Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The cure kinetics were investigated by measuring the cure activation energies (E a) with dynamic differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The dielectric characteristic was examined by dielectric analysis (DEA). The mechanical properties were investigated by measuring the critical stress intensity factor (K IC), critical strain energy release rate (G IC), and impact strength test. As a result, DGEBA/PET was successfully blended. The E a of the <b>blend</b> <b>system</b> was increased with increasing PET content to a maximum at 10 phr PET. The dielectric constant was decreased with increasing PET content. The mechanical properties of the <b>blend</b> <b>system</b> were also superior {{to those of the}} neat DGEBA. These results were attributed to the increased cross-linking density of the <b>blend</b> <b>system,</b> resulting from the interaction between the epoxy group of DGEBA and the carboxyl group of PET...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Foaming of <b>blend</b> <b>systems</b> is a {{promising}} approach to develop cellular materials {{with a set}} of desired properties. However, foaming of <b>blend</b> <b>systems</b> is not only a chance but also a challenge, as different polymers have to be foamed at the same foaming conditions. The best conditions during foaming are individual to each polymer and influence the obtained cellular structure. In immiscible polymer blends like poly(2, 6 -dimethyl- 1, 4 -phenylene ether) (PPE) and poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (SAN) the differences in glass-transition temperature (Tg) and viscosity are vast and can inhibit the foaming of the <b>blend</b> <b>system.</b> In order to minimize the above-mentioned difference in Tg and viscosity, one approach is to choose a blowing agent, which shows a selective solubility in one polymer phase, working as a selective plasticizer. The aim of the present study is to evaluate systematically the foaming behavior of immiscible PPE/SAN <b>blend</b> <b>systems</b> using ethanol and n-pentane as blowing agents. Mass uptake of ethanol and n-pentane in the PPE/SAN-blends as function of the blend composition is measured, offering a selective solubility of ethanol in SAN, whil...|$|R

2500|$|Production {{began in}} November 2000 when LucasArts {{were asked to}} make a game based on [...] {{featuring}} Jango Fett. They presented the game design proposal in March 2001, and development started soon after. Jon Knoles revealed {{in an interview that}} they wanted to develop Jango into the ideal action-based video-game character and that he was to be exciting to watch and fun to play. Secondly they wanted to develop a story that fleshed out Fett's character more fully than in Attack of the Clones, {{while at the same time}} remaining true to the spirit of his character as seen in the film. It was imperative to not dull the game with a slow story and leaden script; as such, their goal was to work a fine balance between back story, narrative, and action-packed gameplay. Knoles said Jango Fett was developed to be an extension of the player's will, the ideal vessel through which the player could live out the fantasy of being the galaxy's most dangerous bounty hunter. His movement and animation <b>blending</b> <b>system</b> was designed to automatically react to other world objects and to never be unable to use his weapons or devices in any situation. The jet-pack was originally designed to be used in areas specifically designed for its use. When the team got it working, they changed their minds and implemented a rechargeable timer on it so the player could use it anywhere for a limited time. At the most, the crew was over fifty people that were working on the game, excluding Industrial Light & Magic (ILM).|$|E

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in studying crystalline/crystalline <b>blend</b> <b>systems</b> {{in the last decade}} because of the different morphological structures formed during the crystallization process. Of particular interest is <b>blend</b> <b>systems</b> formed from polymers with similar thermal properties. In this study crystalline/crystalline <b>blend</b> <b>system</b> of polycaprolactone (PCL) and poly (hexylene adipate) (PhAd), having similar thermal properties was studied. Miscibility and crystallization behavior were investigated using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Polarized Light Microscopy (PLM). Miscibility was confirmed by the presence of a homogeneous phase in the melt state. All the blends showed a major crystallization exotherm around 30 0 C. For blends with PCL content less than 40 %, an additional crystallization exotherm at low temperatures was observed (Fig. 1 inset) and is due to fractional crystallization. A similar behaviour has also been seen in PESub/PEO blend [1]. The intensity of the crystalline bands of PCL and PhAd at 841 cm- 1 and 911 cm- 1 respectively was monitored by FTIR (Fig. 2) to explain the crystallization kinetics of each component in the <b>blend</b> <b>system.</b> <b>Blends</b> isothermally crystallized at 47 0 C showed simultaneous increase in both the band’s absorbance with PhAd showing a faster crystallization rate.

40|$|For {{construction}} equipment in general fuel efficiency {{is one of}} the most critical product attributes. Pure fuel economy improvements from the engines are extremely expensive to develop. This creates an incitement for development of hybrid technology. This thesis was done in corporation with CPAC Systems in Gothenburg, Sweden. With regenerative braking, the energy that is normally transferred into heat during braking can be stored in a battery or a super capacitor and the stored energy can later be used for propulsion. However the regenerative braking also affects the vehicle dynamics and the driver’s interpretation of the brake pedal which demands for a physical test platform for testing. In this thesis a test platform for testing of concepts was developed and built and a brake <b>blending</b> <b>system</b> was developed and tested on the test platform. The test platform was built in small scale compared to a full wheel loader with an articulated rideable lawn mower as base. A small scale test platform has the benefits of fast and easy testing and much lower cost compared to a full scale wheel loader. The test platform is equipped with individual wheel motors and a mechanical brake system based on brakes from a motorcycle. The first step in the development of the control system for the test platform was to make Simulink models for the components in the test platform. Models for the overall vehicle, the brakes and the electrical motors were developed. From the models a control strategy was developed to control the requested torque to the electric motors and the requested brake pressure to the brakes from the driver’s inputs. The control strategy was developed in Simulink and from Simulink C-code was automatically generated by the code generation tool TargetLink. All testing including testing of the brake <b>blending</b> <b>system</b> was performed on the test platform. The result of this thesis is a test platform that is built to emulate a small scale hybrid wheel loader.

A matrix effect of a-BPDA/ODA was investigated by comparing with an isomer PI system, s-BPDA/ODA (s-BPDA: 3, 3, 4, 4 -biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride). Neither of the PMDA/PDA-based <b>blend</b> <b>systems</b> with a minor fraction of these flexible PIs showed any distinct glass transitions during dynamic mechanical thermal analysis.
