25|$|There {{is also a}} {{well-known}} Romanian legend about {{a young man named}} Dragoș Vodă who went hunting for an aurochs or a wisent, followed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> dogs. During the hunting expedition, all the dogs got tired and fell down, except for a female dog named Molda which ran to the wild animal all the time. After the wisent entered into a river, the female dog did the same thing, but unfortunately it got drowned and died in that way. Thanks to Molda, Dragoș finally killed the wisent and cut its head off, and in memory of his dog's sacrifice, he named the river and the land after MOLda – MOLdovA. That legend, which is a fictional story, explains the name of the territory and country's etymology and also explains why the symbol of Moldova is the wisent head.|$|E
500|$|Thompson {{also took}} issue with another 2 Live Crew song, [...] "Banned in the U.S.A.". He {{sent a letter to}} Jon Landau, manager of Bruce Springsteen, whose song [...] "Born in the U.S.A." [...] was to be sampled by the group. Thompson {{suggested}} that Landau [...] "protect 'Born in the U.S.A.' from its apparent theft <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> clowns who traffic toxic waste to kids," [...] or else Thompson would [...] "be telling the nation about Mr. Springsteen's tacit approval" [...] of the song, which, according to Campbell, [...] "expresses anger about the failure of the First Amendment to protect 2 Live Crew from prosecution". Thompson also said, [...] "the 'social commentary' on this album is akin to a sociopath's discharging his AK-47 into a crowded schoolyard, with the machine gun bursts interrupted by Pee-wee Herman's views on politics".|$|E

Valverde's victory– his fourth of the season since returning from a doping ban– was enough to move him into the lead of the points classification, while the bonus seconds awarded on the line moved him into sixth place overall, 20 seconds down on race leader Wiggins.|$|E

500|$|Alan Sepinwall {{was very}} {{positive}} towards the episode on his blog What's Alan Watching, calling Czuchry's casting [...] "genius" [...] and that [...] "the heavier {{focus on the}} rape storyline was welcome, though {{the amount of time}} spent on Logan Squared robbed it of some urgency." [...] In addition, he wrote that [...] "The 'Just Shoot Me' reunion gave an interesting twist to the usual private eye infidelity case." [...] Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, gave a mostly positive review, writing that it struck a good balance in a storyline that could go wrong very quickly. [...] "This happens with emotionally charged criminal cases. Mass public scapegoating is an all-too-human reaction, one studied <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> social sciences (Salem Witch Trials, anyone?).

500|$|A recent {{nickname}} for Town is [...] "The Tractor Boys", which was coined during the club's brief {{period in the}} Premiership (2000–01 and 2001–02) when the team regularly competed against more fashionable clubs. The nickname {{is an example of}} self-deprecating humour referring to Ipswich's agricultural heritage. The origins of the nickname are not certain, but the first generally accepted use of the nickname was created whilst playing at Leeds United in 2000–2001: Ipswich were winning the game 2–1 and the Leeds fans started chanting, 'We're being beaten <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> tractor drivers.' Barracking by supporters of more established Premiership clubs during Town's spell in the Premiership lent the ironic chant '1–0 to the Tractor Boys' increased potency and publicity, and the nickname is commonly used by the media. Former Town manager Jim Magilton commented, in the local press, that he disliked the nickname and said that it conjured up, 'images of carrot-crunching yokels', while players such as Matt Holland accepted the chant with good humour.|$|E
500|$|... "Paranoid Android" [...] {{received}} acclaim {{from music}} critics. NME chose it as its [...] "Single of the Week", and journalist Simon Williams described how the song [...] "prawls {{out like a}} plump man on a small sofa, featuring all manner of crypto-flamenco shufflings, medieval wailings, furiously wrenched guitars and ravishingly over-ambitious ideas. Possesses {{one of the most}} unorthodox 'axe' solos known to mankind." [...] The style of the song was compared to that of Queen by Rolling Stones Mark Kemp, while other critics, including David Browne of Entertainment Weekly, Jon Lusk of the BBC and Simon Williams of NME wrote about its similarity to Queen's [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody". Williams described the song as being [...] "not unlike 'Bohemian Rhapsody' being played backwards <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> Vietnam vets high on Kings Cross-quality crack". Kemp praised the song's mix of acoustic and electronic instrumentation, which he believed were melded to produce [...] "complex tempo changes, touches of dissonance, ancient choral music and a King Crimson-like melodic structure". Meanwhile Browne wrote of [...] "celestial call-and-response vocal passages, dynamically varied sections, and Thom Yorke's high-voiced bleat". The A.V. Club called the song unforgettable and an [...] "amazing epic single".|$|E

S by Shakira Eau Florale is categorized as a [...] "floral musky scent", and according to Shakira's official website, it is a [...] "floral interpretation of the first fragrance by Shakira". The top notes include bergamot and cassis; the heart notes consist of jasmine, heliotropium, and wild red fruits; the base notes consist of musk and vanilla extracts.

500|$|In an NPR {{interview}} via affiliate WBUR-FM, Mumbai Mirror columnist Aseem Chhabra called Chak De! India [...] "an {{example of}} a film that's been made {{within the framework of}} Bollywood and yet it is a very different film. It does take up some realistic issues, and what I really liked about the film was that the women who acted, you know, who are part of the team, each one of them got a chance. Their personality, their characters, were very well-written, and so, the superstar in the film was Shahrukh Khan, who was the coach of the team; he doesn't sort of take over the whole film. Every supporting character gets a role, and it's a very inspiring movie that really changed the mood in India. People loved it". Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave the film four out of five stars stating that it was a film of [...] "great performances <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> unknowns." [...] India Today called Chak De! India [...] "the most feisty girl power movie to have come out of Bollywood ever."

[...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "Chak De's ... a winner all the way." [...] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express called the film [...] "the most authentic, meticulously researched sports movie India has made". [...] In Kolkata's Telegraph, Bharathi S. Pradhan wrote that the film combines [...] "an extremely well-knit screenplay with unrelentingly deft direction, 16 unknown, and not even glamorous, girls simply carried you with them, with one single known actor compelling you to watch Chak De India without blinking". Jaspreet Pandohar of the BBC gave Chak De! India four out of five stars stating that [...] "while the tale of the sporting underdog is hardly new, Jaideep Sahni's screenplay offers a rare look at a popular Indian sport often overshadowed by cricket." [...] Andy Webster of The New York Times wrote that the film gave a fresh look to the conventional underdog sports film, comparing its premise to the U.S. victory in the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup. Derek Elley of Variety called Chak De! India [...] "a patriotic heartwarmer that scores some old-fashioned entertainment goals." [...] In The Hollywood Reporter, Kirk Honeycutt wrote that the [...] "technical credits are first rate with excellent cinematography, quicksilver editing, musical montages of practice and a fine use of locations." ...|$|E

[...] Later in 2008, he testified to the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, stating that [...] "The rapid growth in the use of derivatives has created an opaque market whose outstanding notional value is measured in the hundreds of trillions of dollars.

[...] Hardcore historian Steven Blush states that for West coasters, the first hardcore record was Out of Vogue by the Santa Ana band Middle Class. The band pioneered a shouted, fast version of punk rock which would shape the hardcore sound that would soon emerge. In terms of impact upon the hardcore scene, Black Flag has been deemed the most influential group. Michael Azerrad, author of Our Band Could Be Your Life, calls Black Flag the [...] "godfathers" [...] of hardcore punk and states that even [...] "...more than the flagship band of American hardcore", they were [...] "...required listening for anyone who was interested in underground music."

Formed in Hermosa Beach, California by guitarist and lyricist Greg Ginn, they played their first show in December 1977. Originally called Panic, they changed their name to Black Flag in 1978.
