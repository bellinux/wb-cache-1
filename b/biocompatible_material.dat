2500|$|The {{biomaterial}} term is {{used for}} materials {{that can be used}} in biomedical and clinical applications. They are bioactive and biocompatible in nature. Currently, many types of metals and alloys (stainless steel, titanium, nickel, magnesium, Co–Cr alloys, Ti alloys), ceramics (zirconia, bioglass, alumina, hydroxyapatite) [...] and polymers (acrylic, nylon, silicone, polyurethane, polycaprolactone, polyanhydrides) [...] are used for load bearing application. This includes dental replacement and bone joining or replacement for medical and clinical application. Therefore their mechanical properties are very important. Mechanical properties of some biomaterials and bone are summarized in table 1. Among them hydroxyapatite is most widely studied bioactive and <b>biocompatible</b> <b>material.</b> However, it has lower young’s modulus and fracture toughness with brittle nature. Hence, it is required to produce a biomaterial with good mechanical properties.|$|E
2500|$|Selecting {{the type}} of head group depends on the {{application}} of the SAM. Typically, head groups are connected to a molecular chain in which the terminal end can be functionalized (i.e. adding –OH, –NH2, –COOH, or –SH groups) to vary the wetting and interfacial properties. An appropriate substrate is chosen to react with the head group. Substrates can be planar surfaces, such as silicon and metals, or curved surfaces, such as nanoparticles. Alkanethiols are the most commonly used molecules for SAMs. Alkanethiols are molecules with an alkyl chain, (C-C)ⁿ chain, as the back bone, a tail group, and a S-H head group. Other types of interesting molecules include aromatic thiols, of interest in molecular electronics, in which the alkane chain is (partly) replaced by aromatic rings. An example is the dithiol 1,4-Benzenedimethanethiol (SHCH2C6H4CH2SH)). Interest in such dithiols stems from the possibility of linking the two sulfur ends to metallic contacts, which was first used in molecular conduction measurements. Thiols are frequently used on noble metal substrates because of the strong affinity of sulfur for these metals. The sulfur gold interaction is semi-covalent and has a strength of approximately 45kcal/mol. [...] In addition, gold is an inert and <b>biocompatible</b> <b>material</b> that is easy to acquire. It is also easy to pattern via lithography, a useful feature for applications in nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS). Additionally, it can withstand harsh chemical cleaning treatments. Recently other chalcogenide SAMs: selenides and tellurides have attracted attention in a search for different bonding characteristics to substrates affecting the SAM characteristics and which could be of interest in some applications such as molecular electronics. Silanes are generally used on nonmetallic oxide surfaces; however monolayers formed from covalent bonds between silicon and carbon or oxygen cannot be considered self assembled because they do not form reversibly. Self-assembled monolayers of thiolates on noble metals are a special case because the metal-metal bonds become reversible after the formation of the thiolate-metal complex. This reversibility is what gives rise to vacancy islands and it is why SAMs of alkanethiolates can be thermally desorbed and undergo exchange with free thiols.|$|E

Biologic mesh is primarily indicated for several types of hernia repair, including inguinal and ventral hernias, hernia prophylaxis, and contaminated hernia repairs. However, it has also been used in pelvic floor dysfunction, parotidectomy, and reconstructive plastic surgery.

40|$|Paramagnetic {{centers in}} the two {{exemplary}} synthetic and natural dental <b>biocompatible</b> <b>materials</b> applied in implantology were examined {{by the use of}} an X-band (9. 3 GHz) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The EPR spectra were measured in the range of microwave power 2. 2 – 70 mW. The aims of this work were to compare paramagnetic centers concentrations in different dental <b>biocompatible</b> <b>materials</b> and to determine the effect of microwave power on parameters of their EPR spectra. It is the very first and innovatory examination of paramagnetic {{centers in the}}se materials. It was pointed out that paramagnetic centers existed in both natural (~ 1018 spin/g) and synthetic (~ 1019 spin/g) dental <b>biocompatible</b> <b>materials,</b> but the lower free radical concentration characterized the natural sample. Continuous microwave saturation of EPR spectra indicated that faster spin-lattice relaxation processes existed in synthetic dental <b>biocompatible</b> <b>materials</b> than in natural material. Linewidths (ΔBpp) of the EPR spectra of the natural dental material slightly increased for the higher microwave powers. Such effect was not observed for the synthetic material. The broad EPR lines (ΔBpp) : 2. 4 mT, 3. 9 mT, were measured for the natural and synthetic dental materials, respectively. Probably strong dipolar interactions between paramagnetic centers in the studied samples may be responsible for their line broadening. EPR spectroscopy is the useful experimental method in the examination of paramagnetic centers in dental <b>biocompatible</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R
