5|$|Prior to the {{outbreak}} of war, Congress Heights (so called because the Capitol building in downtown Washington could {{be seen from the}} tops of the hills) were owned by the Berry family, who also owned much of the Anacostia River <b>bottomland</b> {{to the west of the}} Heights. In the days following the First Battle of Bull Run, panicked efforts by the Union were made to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack. These makeshift entrenchments were largely confined to the direct approaches to Washington and the bridges that spanned the Potomac.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} year, the {{garrison}} would be plagued by mosquitoes and the heat and humidity common to the Washington area during the summer. Though Fort Greble was built on a hill, the area immediately surrounding the fort consisted of swampy <b>bottomland</b> drained by the Anacostia and Potomac rivers, {{a breeding ground for}} malaria. Communication with the outside world was provided by the military road that served the Eastern Branch line of forts, and supply wagons would usually arrive on a weekly schedule. Trips to Washington or Uniontown from the fort were uncommon, and by virtue of its location at the extreme end of the Eastern Branch defenses, Fort Greble was isolated even from its neighboring forts.|$|E
5|$|Since its founding, Cooper {{has served}} as the center of attractions for Delta County. The city became host to several small schools and churches. In 1955, the {{construction}} of Cooper Lake was authorized. In 1986, major work on the lake began, and the lake was finished in 1991. The lake is now the most popular tourist attraction in the area. Boating, swimming, and fishing are available at Cooper Lake. The main fish stocked in the lake are catfish, largemouth bass, and crappie. Along the north shore of the lake is the Doctor's Creek Unit of Cooper Lake State Park. The park contains several picnic areas, campgrounds and a large swimming area on Cooper Lake. The park also contains several hiking and equestrian trails. On {{the eastern edge of the}} lake near the Cooper Lake Dam is the Wildlife Observation Deck, a large birdwatching platform. Along the west and northwest shores of the lake is the Cooper Wildlife Management Area. The park was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and protects four unique habitat types. These are wetland, Blackland Prairie, Upland Post Oak, and <b>Bottomland</b> Hardwood. The park contains several hiking trails, as well as birdwatching stations and wildlife viewing areas. The park allows fishing and hunting to visitors if they have a proper license.|$|E

25|$|The first settler was Morgan T. Rich. His plow {{turned the}} first furrow of rich black <b>bottomland</b> in 1869. When other {{settlers}} arrived, {{they formed a}} tiny community and named it Richville, commemorating both its founder and the fertile quality of the soil.|$|E

50|$|Wetlands {{are defined}} {{anywhere}} by {{an abundance of}} water, hydric soils, and a unique flora. The wetland of the New England area exhibit considerable diversity across the range and elevations within the three category: bogs, swamps, and <b>bottomlands.</b> Swamps and bogs are specific habitats whereas <b>bottomlands</b> are any moist area including riparian zones, lake and pond banks, and the moist area surrounding bogs, marshes and swamps.|$|R
25|$|Appalachia is {{characterized}} by winding narrow coves and hidden hollows separated by high ridges. Many of these hollows contained just enough <b>bottomland</b> to support an economy based on subsistence agriculture, but with each crop, the soil grew poorer and poorer. Thus, to make ends meet, farmers in communities such as Cosby and Del Rio began setting aside some of their corn crop for liquor production. These early distillers found an easy market in the taverns and saloons of Newport, itself located {{at a point where}} the Appalachian highlands meet the Tennessee Valley.|$|E
25|$|Blacks cleared land, selling {{timber and}} {{developing}} <b>bottomland</b> to achieve ownership. In 1900, two-thirds of farm owners in Mississippi were blacks, a major achievement {{for them and}} their families. Due to the poor economy, low cotton prices and difficulty of getting credit, many of these farmers could not make it through the extended financial difficulties. Two decades later, the majority of African Americans were sharecroppers. The low prices of cotton into the 1890s meant that more than a generation of African Americans lost the result of their labor when they had to sell their farms to pay off accumulated debts.|$|E
25|$|Because the Mississippi Delta {{contained}} so much fertile <b>bottomland</b> {{that had}} not been developed before the Civil War, 90 percent of the land was still frontier. After the Civil War, tens of thousands of migrants were attracted to the area by higher wages offered by planters trying to develop land. In addition, black and white workers could earn money by clearing the land and raising timber, and eventually advance to ownership. The new farmers included many freedmen, who achieved unusually high rates of land ownership in the Mississippi bottomlands by the late 19th century. In the 1870s and 1880s, many black farmers succeeded in gaining land ownership.|$|E

25|$|Mississippi's rank {{as one of}} {{the poorest}} states is related to its {{dependence}} on cotton agriculture before and after the Civil War, late development of its frontier bottomlands in the Mississippi Delta, repeated natural disasters of flooding in the late 19th and early 20th century that required massive capital investment in levees, and ditching and draining the bottomlands, and slow development of railroads to link <b>bottomland</b> towns and river cities. In addition, when Democrats regained control of the state legislature, they passed the 1890 constitution that discouraged corporate industrial development in favor of rural agriculture, a legacy that would slow the state's progress for years.|$|E

Closest viewing areas of Mount Hood from the valley floor are from the village of Kenwood, from the intersection of State Route 12 with Pythian Road, and from the community of Oakmont, the easternmost neighborhood of Santa Rosa. From these viewing locations a volcanic rocky outcrop near the peak of Mount Hood, also known as Gunsight Point, is prominent on the Mayacmas ridgeline, along with Bald Mountain, within Sugarloaf Ridge State Park, itself located approximately three miles east.|$|E
25|$|Winder's brigade {{crossed the}} river by 5 a.m. and {{deployed}} to attack east across the <b>bottomland.</b> Winder sent two regiments (2nd Virginia and 4th Virginia) {{into the woods}} to flank the Union line and assault the Coaling. When the main Confederate battle line advanced, it {{came under heavy fire}} from the Union artillery and was soon pinned down. Confederate batteries were brought forward onto the plain but were outgunned and forced to seek safer positions. Ewell's brigades were hurried forward to cross the river. Seeing the strength of the Union artillery at the Coaling, Jackson sent Richard Taylor's brigade (including the famed Louisiana Tigers) to the right into the woods to support the flanking column that was attempting to advance through the thick underbrush.|$|E

The <b>bottomlands</b> and margin areas of the coniferous forests consist of: red maple, silver maple, white cedar, and balsam poplar. In wet areas throughout the region many sub-canopy species of willow (Salix spp.) occur, as does speckled alder (Alnus rugosa), which is very common.|$|R
25|$|Hunting parties {{left their}} towns after the growing season, moving up {{tributary}} streams to temporary camps {{through the winter}} in the state. Local legends suggest the hunt had a religious aspect.). The Riparian zone on the lower western drainage of the Allegheny Mountains has some creek bottoms which were covered over with shallow beaver lakes. At the base of these hills is the mantel created by watering animals {{at the edge of}} the beaver lake. The narrower bottom creeks become brooks flowing around cliff ridge-lines and rolling hills on enveloped terraces feeding the <b>bottomland</b> of major rivers. Along the bottom land and terrace of slower moving waters, the Late Prehistoric farming Indian had lived and canoed. Occasionally, an earlier hunter's point from antiquity can be found around these mantels, which are distant from today's dryer creek beds across plowable bottoms. With the exception of elk and mountain lion, absent today, these bowmen hunted today's game.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the arrival}} of European settlers, the area that would become Harlem (originally Haarlem) was {{inhabited}} by the Manhattans, a native tribe, who along with other Native Americans, most likely Lenape occupied the area on a semi-nomadic basis. As many as several hundred farmed the Harlem flatlands. The first European settlement in the area was by siblings Hendrick (Henry), Isaac and Rachel de Forest, Franco-Dutch immigrants in 1637. In 1639 Jochem Pietersen Kuyter established the homestead named Zedendaal, or Blessed Valley, stretched along the Harlem River from about the present 127th Street to 140th Street. Early European settlers were forced to flee to New Amsterdam in lower Manhattan whenever hostilities with the natives heated up, and the native population gradually decreased amidst conflict with the Dutch. The settlement was named Nieuw Haarlem (New Haarlem), after the Dutch city of Haarlem, and was formally incorporated in 1660 under leadership of Peter Stuyvesant. The Indian trail to Harlem's lush <b>bottomland</b> meadows was rebuilt by black laborers of the Dutch West India Company, and eventually developed into the Boston Post Road.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of European American {{settlers}} and explorers, the Allegheny Mountain Range of the Appalachian Mountains was overlaid with old-growth forests consisting predominantly of deciduous hardwood trees, which were characterized by individual trees of enormous size and girth. The American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) was one of the species of trees that proliferated throughout these old-growth forests. American sycamores can grow at least [...] in height and the species is distributed throughout the Eastern United States. It usually thrives in moist soils along streams, especially in sandy loam soils. American sycamores are a dominant species in <b>bottomland</b> and riparian forests. The species is present throughout every county in West Virginia, and is most abundant along the state's streams.|$|E
50|$|In North America, {{the species}} is widely {{distributed}} east of the Rocky Mountains, but elsewhere, it is mostly replaced by the black-tailed or mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). In western North America, it is found in aspen parklands and deciduous river <b>bottomlands</b> within the central and northern Great Plains, and in mixed deciduous riparian corridors, river valley <b>bottomlands,</b> and lower foothills of the northern Rocky Mountain regions from South Dakota and Wyoming to northeastern British Columbia, including the Montana Valley and Foothill grasslands.|$|R

50|$|Isaiah T. Montgomery led the {{founding}} of Mound Bayou in 1887 in wilderness in northwest Mississippi. The <b>bottomlands</b> of the Delta were a relatively undeveloped frontier, and blacks {{had a chance to}} clear land and acquire ownership in such frontier areas. By 1900 two-thirds of the owners of land in the <b>bottomlands</b> were black farmers. With high debt and continuing agricultural problems, most of them lost their land and by 1920 were sharecroppers. As cotton prices fell, the town suffered a severe economic decline in the 1920s and 1930s.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{the rivers}} support {{intensive}} irrigated agriculture on the fertile <b>bottomlands.</b> Two of Peru's five largest cities, including Piura and Chiclayo, lie within the agricultural {{region in the}} north.|$|R
25|$|Despite discrimination, {{many blacks}} became {{property}} owners {{in areas that}} were still developing. For instance, 90% of the Mississippi's <b>bottomlands</b> were still frontier and undeveloped after the war. By {{the end of the}} century, two-thirds of the farmers in Mississippi's Delta <b>bottomlands</b> were black. They had cleared the land themselves and often made money in early years by selling off timber. Tens of thousands of migrants went to the Delta, both to work as laborers to clear timber for lumber companies, and many to develop their own farms. By the end of the century, two-thirds of farm owners in the Delta <b>bottomlands</b> were black. However, the long agricultural depression, along with disenfranchisement and lack of access to credit, led to many blacks in the Delta losing their property by 1910 and becoming sharecroppers or landless workers over the following decade. More than two generations of free African Americans lost their stake in property.|$|R
