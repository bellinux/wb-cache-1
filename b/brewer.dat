5|$|At the 2000 NHL Entry Draft, the Islanders traded <b>Brewer,</b> Josh Green {{and their}} second round {{selection}} (Brad Winchester) {{in the same}} draft to the Edmonton Oilers for Roman Hamrlík. Although surprised to be traded, <b>Brewer</b> was excited {{at the prospect of}} playing for the Oilers, who saw <b>Brewer</b> as a top-four defenceman. However, Brewer's Oiler career began on a sour note as he suffered a bruised left hip and tailbone in his first game with the team. <b>Brewer</b> missed the next four games before returning to the lineup. <b>Brewer</b> scored his first goal as an Oiler on November 7, 2000, against the New York Rangers. <b>Brewer</b> finished his first Oiler season with career highs in goals, assists and points, as well as the best plus/minus rating on the Oilers team, a plus-15. Further, <b>Brewer</b> gained his first NHL playoff experience, a quarterfinal series versus the Dallas Stars. <b>Brewer</b> had six points, but the Oilers were eliminated four games to two by the Stars.|$|E
5|$|<b>Brewer</b> {{was born}} on April 17, 1979, in Vernon, British Columbia, to Anna and Frank <b>Brewer.</b> He was raised in Ashcroft, British Columbia, and began playing ice hockey in the Ashcroft Minor Hockey program. When he was fourteen, {{his family moved to}} Kamloops, British Columbia, where he {{attended}} junior and senior high school. <b>Brewer</b> excelled with the Kamloops Bantam AAA Jardine Blazers of the British Columbia Amateur Hockey Association (BCAHA). In 1995, <b>Brewer</b> was exposed to BCAHA Best Ever, a program designed to find and develop players and coaches for play in international competition. As a young hockey player, <b>Brewer</b> looked up to NHL stars Scott Niedermayer and Jeremy Roenick as role models.|$|E
5|$|In August 2005, {{following}} the lockout, the Oilers traded <b>Brewer,</b> Jeff Woywitka and Doug Lynch to the St. Louis Blues {{in exchange for}} defenceman Chris Pronger. At {{the time of the}} trade, <b>Brewer</b> was a restricted free agent, so on August 15, 2005, <b>Brewer</b> accepted the Blues' qualifying offer, signing a one-year, $2-million contract. Brewer's first season with the Blues was a particularly poor one. After playing the first 18 games of the season, <b>Brewer</b> separated his shoulder on November 16, 2005, in a 2–0 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets. <b>Brewer</b> missed ten games before being activated from the injured reserve list, returning to the St. Louis line-up for a game on December 20, 2005, against the Phoenix Coyotes. Less than a month later, in a game on January 13, 2006, against the Atlanta Thrashers, <b>Brewer</b> collided with the Thrashers' centre Karl Stewart, and dislocated his left shoulder, which ended his season. In just 32 games, <b>Brewer</b> finished his season with nine points, including six goals, two shy of his career best of eight set in the 2002–04 season. Despite his limited play, the Blues re-signed <b>Brewer</b> to a one-year, $2.014 million contract for the 2006–07 season.|$|E

50|$|Following the no hitter, the <b>Brewers</b> {{recorded}} eleven {{hits and}} defeated the Tigers in a come-back win. The following day, the <b>Brewers</b> defeated the Tigers {{to win the}} series. The <b>Brewers</b> traveled to Minnesota to face the rival Twins. In the first game, the <b>Brewers</b> recorded fifteen hits with an 11-3 win. In the three games following the no hitter, the <b>Brewers</b> recorded 39 hits and 20 runs. The <b>Brewers</b> were victorious in two of three games against the Twins.|$|R
5|$|Just over a {{year after}} being drafted, <b>Brewer</b> signed his first {{professional}} contract with his draft team, the New York Islanders, in August 1998. Entering the NHL, <b>Brewer</b> {{was regarded as a}} future Norris Trophy candidate, and as a result, his contract was an entry level three-year, $2.775-million deal complemented by a $1-million signing bonus, the highest base salary available for a rookie. <b>Brewer</b> made his NHL debut on October 10, 1998, against the Pittsburgh Penguins, and on November 5, <b>Brewer</b> scored his first career goal against the Carolina Hurricanes' Trevor Kidd. Throughout his rookie season, <b>Brewer</b> was considered {{an integral part of the}} Islanders' defence, and, along with Zdeno Chára, Kenny Jönsson and Roberto Luongo, was considered untouchable by management at the 1999 NHL trade deadline. <b>Brewer</b> finished his rookie season with eleven points in 63 games.|$|E
5|$|On May 15, 2004, <b>Brewer</b> {{was named}} to the Canadian roster for the 2004 World Cup of Hockey. In the {{semifinal}} of the tournament, <b>Brewer</b> scored Canada's first goal of the game in 4–3 overtime victory against the Czech Republic. Team Canada would go on to win the tournament on home ice in Toronto, defeating Finland 3–2 in the final. Just under one year following his World Cup appearance, <b>Brewer</b> {{was named to}} the orientation camp for the Canadian team at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy held from August 15–20, 2005, in Vancouver and Kelowna, British Columbia. Following the camp, on October 18, 2005, <b>Brewer</b> {{was named to the}} preliminary 81-man Canadian roster for the tournament. However, when the final roster was announced on December 21, 2005, <b>Brewer</b> was not among the 26 players listed. As a result, it would be nearly three years before <b>Brewer</b> would next suit up for his country, when on April 3, 2007, <b>Brewer</b> was among the first five players named to play for Canada at the 2007 IIHF World Championship in Moscow and Mytishchi, Russia. For the tournament, <b>Brewer</b> was named as the team's only permanent alternate captain and helped the team to its third gold medal at the tournament in the past five years.|$|E
5|$|After playing {{just three}} {{games of the}} 1999–2000 NHL season, <b>Brewer</b> was {{assigned}} to the Islanders' AHL affiliate, the Lowell Lock Monsters. It was speculated that the reason behind this move was laziness by <b>Brewer,</b> who was benched during the final thirty minutes by head coach Butch Goring after losing a race for the puck against Mike Knuble in the Islanders' October 11, 1999, loss to the New York Rangers. <b>Brewer</b> also took a bad penalty earlier in the game, putting the Islanders down two men. After a two-week, five-game stint with the Lock Monsters, <b>Brewer</b> was subsequently recalled by the Islanders. After playing 26 games with the Islanders in which he only recorded two assists, <b>Brewer</b> was reassigned to the Lock Monsters on January 8, 2000, {{for the remainder of the}} season. Shortly after joining the Lock Monsters, <b>Brewer</b> suffered a sprained knee and missed the next two-and-a-half months of the season. <b>Brewer</b> went on to play 25 games for the Lock Monsters, recording two goals and two assists. He also participated in his first professional playoffs, as the Lock Monsters swept the Saint John Flames in three games in the first round, before being swept themselves in four games in the Eastern Conference semifinals by the Providence Bruins.|$|E

Later in the season, in a game on January 29, 2004, versus the Chicago Blackhawks, <b>Brewer</b> recorded his one-hundredth career point. Since his team depended on <b>Brewer</b> to play against the opposing teams' best offensive players, he finished the season with an average time on ice of 24:39, ranking fourteenth in the league. In the final year of his two-year contract, <b>Brewer</b> finished the season with his point totals matching those from his 2001–02 NHL season, a slight fall from his career highs set in his third season with the Oilers.|$|E
5|$|In {{his third}} {{season with the}} Blues, <b>Brewer</b> {{continued}} to do well under Andy Murray. <b>Brewer</b> evolved {{into one of the}} top two-way defencemen in the NHL, with comparisons being made between him and former first overall draft pick Chris Phillips of the Ottawa Senators. His play and leadership abilities were recognized, when on February 8, 2008, <b>Brewer</b> was named as the nineteenth captain {{in the history of the}} St. Louis Blues, filling the vacancy created when former Blues captain Dallas Drake had his contract bought out following the 2006–07 season.
