40|$|Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) {{is quickly}} gaining a {{foothold}} in the identification and security industry. However, one major roadblock that prevents companies in adopting RFID technologies is its high manufacturing cost, particularly assembly cost. One approach to reduce the assembly cost is using surface mount technology. Currently anisotropic conductive adhesives (ACA) tape, isotropic conductive adhesives (ICA) and non-conductive adhesives (NCA) are being used for RFID flip chip assembly. Typically the ACA tape and NCA provide the necessary height control in the assembly. However, few literatures discuss about the possibility of using ICA as flip chip connection for different RFID product. In this work, we have developed techniques based on finite-element method. We use the full wave analysis approach that combines full wave simulator HFSS (High Frequency Structure Simulator) with circuit simulator ADS (Advanced Design System) to simulate the different packaging approach and the electromagnetic effects on the transponder strap. From the results, design guideline by using low cost ICA as RFID flip chip interconnect can be obtained.

40|$|The {{advent of}} storage {{phosphor}} {{technology has been}} of considerable benefit to the imaging of gel-separated radiolabeled proteins due to the rapid and quantitative nature of the data acquisition process. Previously, times over one month were required to obtain fluorographs of the same gel to yield data of sufficient dynamic range for quantitative analysis of high-resolution two-dimensional (2 -D) gels. As {{we are in the}} process of building a human 2 -D gel protein database, and therefore have a high throughput of 2 -D gels both to image and quantitate using the Quest II software, we undertook an evaluation of a storage phosphor imager, including an evaluation of signal fade. The results of this evaluation demonstrate the feasibility of using such a system, and we describe the procedures that allow us to use this technique for quantitative analysis of many complex 2 -D gel patterns. These procedures include a useful <b>batch</b> <b>printing</b> program that allows printing of many images in a non-interactive mode. Examples will be presented of how autoradiography, using storage phosphor plates and the Quest II system, have enabled us to begin building a human 2 -D gel protein database including posttranslational modification information, without the previous time constraints associated with such a project...|$|E

For 0.5 -mm-thick disks, produced using scan strategy D, the coefficient of variation of disk thickness was 2.7 % and it is therefore possible that a similar variation in collimator septa could also be present (although no image distortion or significant variation in image resolution was observed). It {{is also possible that}} collimator production may vary between <b>print</b> <b>batches.</b> To assess batch reproducibility, the performance characteristics of identical collimators manufactured at different times would have to be analysed.

40|$|Liquid chromatography–mass {{spectrometry}} (LC–MS) with electrospray (ES) ionization in {{the positive}} ion mode {{was applied to}} drug analysis in forensic toxicology. Several types of screening and confirmation strategies were developed, based essentially on searching of comprehensive MS libraries and databases that were created in-house for the purpose. Two spectral libraries, both containing spectra for approximately 400 drugs, were created. Spectra for the LC–MS/in-source collision-induced dissociation (CID) library were acquired by continuously switching between low (25  V) and high (90  V) orifice voltages during the run, and the summed mass spectra {{were added to the}} library. A library for liquid chromatography–triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) was created by obtaining product ion spectra at a collision energy of 35  eV, and additionally at 20  eV or 50  eV, if the latter were more informative. The product ion spectra were reproducible in the long-term, based on a four-year experiment. Comparison of two libraries, independently created with similar instruments in different laboratories, showed that the libraries were fully compatible. Comparison of spectra obtained with different manufacturers' instruments suggested that after standardization of collision energy and gas pressure, LC–MS/MS spectral libraries are suitable for interlaboratory use. The libraries were utilized in two fully automated methods for selected drug groups, comprising screening and confirmation. Analysis of 16 β-blocking drugs in urine involved two-step MS analysis, including a screening step based on monitoring of protonated molecules and a confirmation step based on LC–MS/MS product ion spectra. A method for simultaneous screening and quantitation of 18 antihistamine drugs in blood involved multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) for screening and quantitation and product ion spectra for confirmation of the drugs. The antihistamines were identified and quantified at concentrations ranging from subtherapeutic to toxic in blood. A data-dependent experiment (DDE) was utilized for automation of both procedures, from starting the sample <b>batch</b> to <b>printing</b> of the library search results. Two different approaches for comprehensive screening of drugs were developed. A method for simultaneous screening of 238 drugs in blood was developed using LC–MS/MS with multiple-reaction monitoring. Identification was based on RT and the presence of protonated molecule and one representative fragment ion. The method was shown to be sufficiently selective and sensitive to allow the majority of the drugs to be detected at therapeutic concentrations. Another approach was based on accurate mass determination with liquid chromatography–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC–MS/TOF), using a target database of monoisotopic masses for 433 drugs. The method was tentatively suitable for rapid screening of drugs in urine even without referral to primary reference standards. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} of additive manufacturing is great: highly complex and efficient structures can be manufactured with hardly any waste material. While high-tech {{industries such as}} aviation and medicine have already embraced additive manufacturing, civil engineering is lagging behind. Research on the structural properties of additive manufactures in civil constructions is necessary to build confidence with structural engineers. The MX 3 D project aims to 3 D print an 8 meter stainless steel bridge with {{gas metal arc welding}} based additive manufacturing. The basic elements - rods of 5 to 7 mm in diameter - are printed with 308 LSi and 316 LSi stainless steel. In this thesis, the structural properties of these elements are investigated by characterizing the geometry, performing structural tests, and studying the microstructure. Several <b>batches</b> were <b>printed</b> with varying process parameters. Every batch contained three types of rods, produced at different angles to the vertical: 0 °, 30 °, and 60 °. The rods were measured through photography and characterized by statistical distributions. Greater production angles led to larger geometrical inaccuracies. The critical geometrical parameters are the minimum and mean diameter. The variation around the mean was described using a normal distribution; the occurrence of small diameters using a Weibull distribution. This resulted in design graphs for the minimum diameter at increasing rod lengths. Micrographs indicated an anisotropic austenitic microstructure of large columnar grains. The grains grew perpendicular to the weld pool, {{in the direction of the}} thermal gradient, across different deposition layers. For 0 ° rods, the grains grew in the main direction of the rod. At 30 ° and 60 °, the weld pool was tilted, and the grain orientation deviated from the main direction, influencing structural behavior. Tensile tests on milled rods confirmed a reduction of the ultimate stress of 10 % for rods produced under an angle. Tensile tests further showed ultimate strength values averaging at 611 MPa. Because the 0, 2 % proof strength was difficult to determine, it is proposed to use 50 % of the ultimate strength as a value for the 0, 2 % proof strength, ensuring that strength and ductility requirements are met. The observed Young's modulus showed great spread and was much lower than expected. This may be result of the anisotropic microstructure, but this is still unclear. Tests also revealed ductile material behaviour, meeting Eurocode requirements. Buckling tests were performed for varying slendernesses. The results are not safely described by any of the existing Eurocode buckling curves. An alternative curve has been presented based on altered values for the imperfection factor and limiting non-dimensional slenderness. Fatigue tests have been performed on one type of element. Using the minimum diameter, a detail class of 81 was found. Because of the large spreads in the properties and the risk of production errors, a quality control system based on ordinary welding is proposed. Conservative models give safe predictions of structural behaviour. Accurate structural models should take into account both geometrical and material variations. This research gives confidence that stainless steel additive manufactures can be used in civil engineering structures and lays the basis for structural design rules.
