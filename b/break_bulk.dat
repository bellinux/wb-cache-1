5|$|There are {{two main}} kinds of freight, bulk cargo and <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> or general cargo, most of which is now transported in containers. Commodities {{in the form of}} liquids, powder or {{particles}} are carried loose in the holds of bulk carriers and include oil, grain, coal, ore, scrap metal, sand and gravel. <b>Break</b> <b>bulk</b> cargo is usually manufactured goods and is transported in packages, often stacked on pallets. Before the arrival of containerization in the 1950s, these goods were loaded, transported and unloaded piecemeal. The use of containers has greatly increased the efficiency and decreased the cost of moving them with most freight now traveling in standard sized, lockable containers loaded on purpose-built container ships at dedicated terminals. Freight forwarding firms book cargo, arrange pickup and delivery, and manage documentation. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization, based in London and first convened in 1959. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.|$|E

25|$|The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (also {{known as}} the Jones Act) {{prevents}} foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between two American ports (a practice known as cabotage). Because of the Jones Act, foreign ships inbound with goods from Central and South America, Western Europe, and Africa cannot stop in Puerto Rico, offload Puerto Rico-bound goods, load mainland-bound Puerto Rico-manufactured goods, and continue to U.S. ports. Instead, they must proceed directly to U.S. ports, where distributors <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> and send Puerto Rico-bound manufactured goods to Puerto Rico across the ocean by U.S.-flagged ships.|$|E
25|$|Before containerization, {{goods were}} usually handled {{manually}} as <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> cargo. Typically, goods would be loaded onto a vehicle {{from the factory}} and taken to a port warehouse {{where they would be}} offloaded and stored awaiting the next vessel. When the vessel arrived, they would be moved {{to the side of the}} ship along with other cargo to be lowered or carried into the hold and packed by dock workers. The ship might call at several other ports before off-loading a given consignment of cargo. Each port visit would delay the delivery of other cargo. Delivered cargo might then have been offloaded into another warehouse before being picked up and delivered to its destination. Multiple handling and delays made transport costly, time consuming and unreliable.|$|E

Containerisation of shipping did not begin until a decade after war, so most wartime military shipments were <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> cargo, with goods in bags, boxes, crates, barrels and drums. This was very efficient in terms of shipping space, but loading and unloading was consequently slow and manpower intensive. It also meant that ships could be unloaded with their own tackle, without special port facilities. Loading a ship was something of an art form. The ideal was to make best use of irregular spaces. Goods had to be stowed so as to wedge everything together tightly, as items that shifted at sea could break open and cause damage to their contents and other items. A load that shifted could even cause the ship to capsize.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} IIA compactifications on solvmanifolds with O 6 /D 6 branes {{and study}} the conditions for obtaining de Sitter vacua in ten dimensions. While this is a popular set-up for searching de Sitter vacua, we propose a new method to include supersymmetry breaking sources. For space-time filling branes preserving bulk supersymmetry, the energy density can easily be extremized with respect to all fields, thanks to {{the replacement of the}} DBI action by a pullback of a special form given by a pure spinor. For sources <b>breaking</b> <b>bulk</b> supersymmetry, we propose to replace the DBI action by the pullback of a more general polyform, which is no longer pure.
