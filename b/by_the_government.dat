5|$|Finally, {{the third}} major factor behind the {{resolution}} of the financial crisis was the decision <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> of Iceland to apply for membership in the EU in July 2009. While views on the feasibility of EU membership are quite mixed in Iceland, this action has served to enhance the credibility of the country on international financial markets. One sign {{of the success of the}} above efforts is the fact that the Icelandic government was successfully able to raise $1 billion with a bond issue on 9 June 2011. This development indicates that international investors have given the government and the new banking system, with two of the three biggest banks now in foreign hands, a clean bill of health. The first two major measures were implemented <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> of Geir H. Haarde but also carried out <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> of Johanna Sigurdardottir, which then took the step to apply for EU membership.|$|E
