500|$|Brosnan has {{expressed}} contempt for his education by the Christian Brothers. However, in 2013 he commented, [...] "It always {{helps to have}} a bit of prayer in your back pocket. At the end of the day, you have to have something and for me that is God, Jesus, my Catholic upbringing, my faith... God has <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> me. My faith has <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> me in the moments of deepest suffering, doubt and fear. It is a constant, the language of prayer... I might not have got my sums right from the Christian Brothers or might not have got the greatest learning of literature from them but I certainly got a strapping amount of faith." [...] Brosnan attends Mass, but adheres to other spiritual beliefs. In 2008 he said [...] "I also love the teachings of Buddhist philosophy. It's my own private faith. I don't preach it, but it's a faith that is a comfort to me when the night is long." ...|$|E

His name was changed after a Baptist preacher visited Jennings's parents and congratulated his mother for naming {{him after the}} Wayland Baptist University in Plainview, Texas. Lorene Jennings, who had been unaware of the college, changed the spelling to Waylon. Jennings later expressed in his autobiography, [...] "I didn't like Waylon.

500|$|In 1976, Ontario singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot wrote, composed, and {{recorded}} the song [...] "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" [...] for his album Summertime Dream. On NPR's Saturday Morning Edition on February 14, 2015, Gordon Lightfoot {{said he was}} inspired to write the song {{when he saw the}} name misspelled [...] "Edmond" [...] in Newsweek magazine two weeks after the sinking; Lightfoot said he felt that it dishonored the memory of the 29 who died. Lightfoot's popular ballad made the sinking of Fitzgerald one of the better-known disasters in the history of Great Lakes shipping. The original lyrics of the song show a degree of artistic license compared to the events of the actual sinking: it states the destination as Cleveland instead of Detroit and, in light of new evidence about what happened, Lightfoot has modified one line for live performances, changing “When suppertime came the old cook came on deck / Saying ‘Fellas, it’s too rough to feed ya.’ / At 7 p.m. a main hatchway caved in / He said, ‘Fellas, it's <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> know ya.” to “When suppertime came the old cook came on deck / Saying ‘Fellows it’s too rough to feed ya.’ / At 7 p.m. it grew dark, it was then / He said, ‘Fellas, it's <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> know ya.’” The song has been covered by many performers. The Toronto rock band Rheostatics recorded it for their second album, Melville, and their live album Double Live. The Dandy Warhols also covered the song in their The Black Album in 2004.|$|E

Muldaur left after season two, with McFadden returning as Crusher for season three.

500|$|May 3, 2006, was {{the premiere}} of Dylan's radio {{presenting}} career, hosting a weekly radio program, Theme Time Radio Hour, for XM Satellite Radio, with song selections revolving around a chosen theme.

The show was praised by fans and critics as [...] "great radio," [...] as Dylan told stories and made eclectic references with his sardonic humor, while achieving a thematic beauty with his musical choices.

500|$|In the Browns' early years, Paul Brown {{wanted to}} keep on reserve a number of {{promising}} players who {{did not make the}} team's official roster.
