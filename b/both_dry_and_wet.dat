25|$|Renaissance Park was {{originally}} {{designated as a}} research park, originally established in May 2003 as the Peoria Medical and Technology District. It consisted of nine residential neighborhoods, Bradley University, the medical district, Caterpillar world headquarters, and the National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research. The Peoria NEXT Innovation Center opened in August 2007 and provides <b>both</b> <b>dry</b> <b>and</b> <b>wet</b> labs, as well as conference and office space for emerging start-up companies. Over $2 billion in research is conducted in Peoria annually. While the Renaissance Park research park project never came to full fruition, many of the original ideas from the original Renaissance Park concept still continue on a smaller level via The Renaissance Park Community Association.|$|E
5|$|The {{cannibalism}} of {{the frog}} {{has been speculated}} to cause its decline in some areas, because the smaller tadpoles can be toxic. Other postulated causes of the decline include increased ultraviolet radiation due to {{the hole in the}} ozone layer, global warming, and increased drought. The first theory was tested and the results were inconclusive. Global warming is not thought to be a credible cause, as the extremities of the frog's range have not changed, while declines in population have occurred in <b>both</b> <b>dry</b> <b>and</b> <b>wetter</b> areas.|$|R
40|$|Fire is a {{prevalent}} {{feature of}} most rangelands, whereas not all fire-prone ecosystems are rangelands. The major rangeland ecosystems at {{a global scale}} (savanna, grasslands, steppe and grassy woodlands) generally occur in regions of intermediate rainfall, are dominated by grasses and experience regular fire (annually to one every few years). In broad transitional zones with <b>both</b> <b>drier</b> <b>and</b> <b>wetter</b> regions, long-term rainfall deviations are largely responsible for fire in vegetation which otherwise doesn 2 Ì† 7 t carry fire. Consequently fire is relatively infrequent in these transitional zones...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} widely {{anticipated}} {{that the combination of}} recent advances in nanocomposites technology with traditional and novel resin systems may create materials with enhanced electrical, thermal and mechanical properties. It has been recognised that charge dynamics under an electric field {{play an important role in}} determining the electrical performance of a material. In this research, the pulsed electroacoustic (PEA) technique has been used to measure space charge in epoxy anhydrite samples loaded with various nano-fillers. Space charge characteristics in <b>both</b> <b>dried</b> <b>and</b> <b>wet</b> samples have been measured at ~ 27 kV/mm. In addition to different charge dynamics, it has also been noticed that the electrical performance of nanocomposites has been affected in the presence of moisture. Further tests have been carried out at a lower field to reveal if different mechanisms take place...|$|R

40|$|The soil {{transport}} coefficient D {{represents the}} relationship between local topographical gradient and soil flux in the landscape evolution model. This work presents new estimates of the soil transport coefficient D at 9 sites and compares them, along with a compilation of 16 previously published estimates of D, against three climate proxies (mean annual precipitation, aridity index, and mean annual temperature) {{with the goal of}} characterizing climatic influences on soil transport efficiency. The new measurements were performed at sites that extend the range into <b>both</b> <b>drier</b> <b>and</b> <b>wetter</b> climates than those published. Together the data suggest that D increases with mean annual precipitation <b>and</b> aridity in <b>dry</b> climates, <b>and</b> levels off or decreases gradually in wetter climates. by Naomi D.

40|$|Adhesive mortars {{are widely}} used to set {{porcelain}} stoneware tiles on buildings because their bond strength and flexibility properties increase the cladding serviceability. However, their long-term performance is not well understood, mainly the degradation of the polymeric matrix. The influence of moisture content on the flexibility of six adhesive mortars is investigated, based on standard EN 12002. Four of them have defined formulations {{and the other two}} are commercial and {{are widely used}} to set porcelain stoneware tiles on building facades in Brazil. The results show that moisture content above 6 % is sufficient to reduce 50 % of the mortar deformability, but that the drying process allows it to recover to a value similar to that prior to saturation; a logarithmic function best fits the correlation between moisture content and flexibility; water immersion increases matrix rigidity. It is suggested that standards should consider flexibility tests on <b>both</b> <b>dried</b> <b>and</b> <b>wet</b> samples as a requirement for polymer-modified mortars. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{effect of}} climate change on the spatiotemporal {{dynamics}} of malaria transmission is studied using an unprecedented ensemble of climate projections, employing three diverse bias correction and downscaling techniques, in order to partially account for uncertainty in climate- driven malaria projections. These large climate ensembles drive two dynamical and spatially explicit epidemiological malaria models to provide future hazard projections for the focus region of eastern Africa. While the two malaria models produce very distinct transmission patterns for the recent climate, their response to future climate change is similar in terms of sign and spatial distribution, with malaria transmission moving to higher altitudes in the East African Community (EAC) region, while transmission reduces in lowland, marginal transmission zones such as South Sudan. The climate model ensemble generally projects warmer <b>and</b> <b>wetter</b> conditions over EAC. The simulated malaria response appears {{to be driven by}} temperature rather than precipitation effects. This reduces the uncertainty due to the climate models, as precipitation trends in tropical regions are very diverse, projecting <b>both</b> <b>drier</b> <b>and</b> <b>wetter</b> conditions with the current state-of-the-art climate model ensemble. The magnitude of the projected changes differed considerably between the two dynamical malaria models, with one much more sensitive to climate change, highlighting that uncertainty in the malaria projections is also associated with the disease modelling approach...|$|R
