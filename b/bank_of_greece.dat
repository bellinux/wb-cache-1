5|$|The World Bank and International Monetary Fund were {{designed}} by delegates at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 and the World Bank, then consisting of only the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, became operational in 1946. Robert L. Garner joined the World Bank in 1947 as a senior executive and expressed his view that private business could {{play an important role}} in international development. In 1950, Garner and his colleagues proposed establishing a new institution for the purpose of making private investments in the developing countries served by the Bank. The U.S. government encouraged the idea of an international corporation working in tandem with the World Bank to invest in private enterprises without accepting guarantees from governments, without managing those enterprises, and by collaborating with third party investors. When describing the IFC in 1955, World Bank President Eugene R. Black said that the IFC would only invest in private firms, rather than make loans to governments, and it would not manage the projects in which it invests. In 1956 the International Finance Corporation became operational under the leadership of Garner. It initially had 12 staff members and $100 million ($844.9 million in 2012 dollars) in capital. The corporation made its inaugural investment in 1957 by making a $2 million ($16.4 million in 2012 dollars) loan to a Brazil-based affiliate of Siemens & Halske (now Siemens AG). In 2007, IFC bought 18% stake in the Indian Financial firm, Angel Broking. In December 2015 IFC supported Greek banks with 150 million euros by buying shares in four of them: Alpha Bank (60 million), Eurobank (50 million), Piraeus Bank (20 million) and National <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Greece</b> (20 million).|$|E

40|$|Although {{the title}} {{seems to be}} a contradictio in terminis, this paper {{identifies}} a small, eclectic number <b>of</b> central <b>banks</b> with private shareholders about which little has been published. It is shown that only the central <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> Belgium, <b>Greece,</b> Italy, Japan, South Africa, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States (US) Federal Reserve allow shareholding other than by the government of the respective countries, although not in all instances by the general public. This paper considers private shareholding in this eclectic group <b>of</b> central <b>banks,</b> despite the trend <b>of</b> nationalising central <b>banks</b> that commenced in 1935. Private shareholding is defined as shareholding in a central bank by any party other than the respective government or governments (e. g. the European Central Bank) where the central bank is located. Large differences in the classes of shareholders of these eclectic central banks and differences in their approaches to dividend payments are highlighted in the paper. The conclusions reached are, firstly, that investment only in the shares <b>of</b> the central <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> Belgium and <b>Greece</b> (albeit only for residents in the latter instance) can be regarded as growth investments. Secondly, shareholding in the Italian central bank has been used to recapitalise ailing commercial banks. Thirdly, shareholders play no role in the formulation and implementation of monetary policy. Lastly, the shareholding structure <b>of</b> these <b>banks</b> contributes to improved governance in the case <b>of</b> the central <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> Belgium, <b>Greece,</b> Italy, South Africa, Switzerland and Turkey, but no evidence can be found that central banks with shareholders in any way outperform central banks without shareholders...|$|R

25|$|The reverberations of the Great Depression hit Greece in 1932. The <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Greece</b> {{tried to}} adopt deflationary {{policies}} {{to stave off}} the crises that were going on in other countries, but these largely failed. For a brief period the drachma was pegged to the U.S. dollar, but this was unsustainable given the country's large trade deficit and the only long-term effects of this were Greece's foreign exchange reserves being almost totally wiped out in 1932. Remittances from abroad declined sharply and the value of the drachma began to plummet from 77 drachmas to the dollar in March 1931 to 111 drachmas to the dollar in April, 1931. This was especially harmful to Greece as the country relied on imports from the UK, France and the Middle East for many necessities. Greece went off the gold standard in April, 1932 and declared a moratorium on all interest payments. The country also adopted protectionist policies such as import quotas, which a number of European countries did during the time period.|$|E

The analysis shows that subsidiary <b>banks</b> located outside <b>of</b> <b>Greece,</b> Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain (GIIPS) but with ownership linkages to these countries have a lower loan growth rate during the crisis period. This suggests that the liquidity shock experienced by GIIPS countries was indeed transmitted to those banks through ownership linkages. Larger subsidiary banks and those subsidiaries that were more profitable {{are found to be}} more resilient to the shock. We also find that the parent bank’s characteristics affect the transmission of the shock, supporting the notion of an internal capital market operating within these banks...|$|R

40|$|The Greek Banking System, in {{its effort}} to prepare itself for the {{changeover}} to the EURO, will face some initial costs. Being the basic institution of money distribution, this changeover will impose a heavy burden on banks. In addition to the costs that banks will sustain, they will derive new benefits. The impact of the EURO on Greek Banks is explained through a cost-benefit analysis, by providing a perspective of the anticipated costs, benefits and outcome. The primary objective {{of this paper is to}} examine the costs that will arise from this changeover and the benefits that will be produced, as explained by the change in the bank profits. The study results consider the existence of two projects: one without the introduction to EURO and one with the introduction to EURO. We proceed through an incremental method to determine when profits will be produced. To further demonstrate this, we have calculated the NPV of the introduction to the EURO by considering the year 2002 as the basic year. The analysis shows that during the period 2002 - 2007 banks will face a loss in their bank profits. Further analysis indicates that profits will rapidly show increases in the long-term period. Therefore, the changeover to the EURO will probably be very lucrative for the <b>banking</b> system <b>of</b> <b>Greece</b> and the economy in general over the long-term. ...|$|R
