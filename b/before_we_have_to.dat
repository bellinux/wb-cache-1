According to Peter Mosely, the band liked the Dixie Chicks' and even thought of collaborating with Maines on Ocean Avenue for the song [...] "View from Heaven". Mosely also revealed that the band approached Maines about singing on [...] "How I Go"; [...] "The original plan was just for her to sing back-up (on the song). [...] it ended up turning into a duet." [...] He also added that Maines took a demo of the song and returned to the studio, Sunset Sound, where the band were working, in addition to the Dixie Chicks working on their album, with lyrics and vocals of her own.|$|E

The policeman took your names and addresses, and will have told the officer in charge of the case the nature of the evidence you will probably give.

5000|$|Noel Murray of The A.V. Club {{described}} the episode {{as having a}} [...] "strong finish" [...] but [...] "very shaky start". He found the resolution of Ben's blackmail plot implausible and the subtext excessive, commenting: [...] "every scene and line in this episode seemed designed {{to make sure that}} we got the point about the cruelty of fate, the burden of power, and so on and so on." [...] Murray enjoyed the episode's [...] "poignant and tense" [...] final minutes, however, and rated the episode [...] "B-" [...] overall, later rethinking his grade and changing it to a [...] "B". BuddyTV's John Kubicek was similarly critical of the episode's subtext, and commented on his growing frustration with the alternate universe: [...] "If the point is to show us how the Island made everyone a more interesting person, we get it, so please stop <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> watch another watered-down character wuss out."

This sparked debate, with Jillian York of Vices Motherboard writing that [...] "If Facebook’s goal is to make the world more open and connected, it could start by treating queer communities with equality", and Tristan Greene of The Next Web writing that [...] "What I don’t understand, Facebook, is why you’re limiting these things at all?

While most of the story for {{the second season}} had been decided before the first season aired, the Duffers took in the audience reactions from the first season to adjust some of the details within the second season. They knew they would not have the same element of audience surprise as when the show aired anew, and were aware fans wanted to see certain elements, but Ross said [...] "...the point is not to give everyone what they think they want.

5000|$|In [...] "Countdown to Destruction", Bulk and Skull undergo {{their most}} {{noteworthy}} change. The Space Rangers had battled the invading forces of Astronema, but were overwhelmed {{and forced to}} retreat. Astronema demanded that the Rangers {{be turned over to}} her or else Earth would be destroyed. When other civilians openly question the Ranger's dependability, Bulk says, [...] "The Rangers have never let us down <b>before.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> believe they'll be here." [...] The next morning, the Rangers (sans Andros, who left to board the Dark Fortress) intend to turn themselves in to save Earth. However, Bulk suddenly announces he's a Ranger, prompting Skull, Professor Phenomenus and every other present civilian to do the same. A frustrated Astronema orders their destruction, but then the real Space Rangers reveal themselves (Bulk is stunned to learn the Rangers were [...] "them"). As the Rangers battle Elgar, the Quantrons and the Piranhatrons, Bulk & Skull have arguably their most defining moment. Bulk, inspired by the Rangers, rallies the civilians together to [...] "get in there" [...] and he and Skull lead the charge to help the Rangers in battle, Bulk fighting off a Quantron to protect Zhane and Skull pulling a Piranhatron off Ashley and throwing it away. After Zordon's energy wave destroys the invading forces, Bulk, Skull, and Professor Phenomenous are among those celebrating.|$|E

40|$|The {{difference}} between learning to copy {{and learning to}} think For senior managers, the {{difference between}} learning by rote and learning to think independently is central. In rote learning we learn how to exactly reproduce something, we copy. This is fine for some purposes: {{we need to know}} exactly where the keys on the keyboard are, otherwise we produce nonsense or type very slowly; and we must reproduce our signature consistently otherwise our cheques or credit card payments may be rejected. But for most purposes in senior management we need to make intelligent judgments about cases that consist of a unique new set of circumstances, not completely the same as anything we saw <b>before.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> think critically, to judge how far previous examples or various general management ideas are relevant to the new case. By ‘critically’ I mean relying on evidence, good logic and considered values, not automatic opposition. A good film critic gives both praise and criticism, according to when they seem due.

40|$|Aronson {{published}} an article indicating that John Bostock’s malady and descrip-tion is the first for ‘summer catarrh / catar-rhus aestivus’. 1 I will {{like to point out}} that a case of nasal allergy has been described <b>before.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go back to the early 10 th century and to Razi (Abubakr Mohammad Ibn Zakaria). He explicitly describes the illness of Abu Zaid Ahmad Ibn Sahl Albal-khi (850 – 934) who suffered from ‘coryza’ every spring when the roses bloomed. Though now there is not a universal agree-ment that roses ’ pollinosis cause the symp-toms but no doubt that the symptoms described and the lengthy treatments and prevention of Razi points to hay fever/ nasal allergy. There are two points of note in this description. The paper describing this was first published by Friedrun R Hau in Medizinhistorisches Journal 2 in the German language and later translated into English and printed in Pakistan Journal of Otolaryngology 3 which I was editing at the time. The second point is the fact that Razi’s writing was not pre-sented as an independent writing but included in Al-Fusul-almuhimma fi tibqa-lumma present in Oxford Codex Hunting-tonianus 461, p 78 - 80.

40|$|Broad band digital {{communication}} that operates over a standard copper wires. It requires the DSL modems which splits the transmissions into 2 frequency bands. The lower frequencies for {{voice and the}} higher frequencies for digital data (internet) in order to transmit the data to larger distances through a copper cable we need modulation techniques. Generally in this DSL modems modulation used is QAM technique. The output of the QAM is complex data this complex data we cannot transfer directly through a copper cable because the data should be in time domain or otherwise the phase of the data which is in frequency domain can be lost, in copper cable so this data should be converted in time domain by using IDFT technique. As IDFT requires more number of complex multiplications and more number of complex additions in comparison to IFFT so to reduce the additions and multiplications IFFT technique is used. At the receiver side we can retrieve the same data by using FFT technique. In this section the implemented FFT architecture is fully efficient and this architecture will require less area.

As Adam fumbled down the stairs, almost tripping several times, he eventually entered into the kitchen. With backpack in hand, he motioned past his father, glancing only faintly into his face, knowing that was what his father was expecting. He plopped his backpack down on the kitchen floor and sat down in his chair at the ever familiar table, following the same routine he had grown accustomed to. It was comfortable to him, allowing a sense of calmness to radiate throughout his self. On the table laid the pop tarts he so enjoyed, the ones that didn’t have the icing on top, the ones with only cherry filling. He handled a pop tart, picking the crust off prior to placing a small portion into his mouth. He nibbled quietly to himself, often smiling between bites. And then slowly he began to hum a rendition of a song, as if there was a concert playing in his head. His fingers tapped lightly on the table’s edge as if to echo the beat that played in his head. His father sat quietly while watching his son begin to fully act out his part in the concert…guitar playing, drum rolls, facial grimaces of the band members he must of seen on the TV…all quite normal for a Monday morning.

40|$|Our main {{interest}} is in the problem of making predictions in the online mode of learning where at every step in time a signal arrives and a prediction {{needs to be made}} before the corresponding outcome arrives. Loss is suffered if the prediction and outcome do not match perfectly. In the prediction with expert advice framework, this protocol is augmented by a pool of experts that produce their predictions <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make ours. The Aggregating Algorithm (AA) is a technique that optimally merges these experts so that the resulting strategy suffers a cumulative loss that is almost as good as that of the best expert in the pool. The AA was applied to the problem of regression, where outcomes are continuous real numbers, to get the AA for Regression (AAR) and its kernel version, KAAR. On typical datasets, KAAR’s empirical performance is not as good as that of Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) which is a popular regression method. KAAR performs better than KRR only when the data is corrupted with lots of noise or contains severe outliers. To alleviate this we introduce methods that are a hybrid between KRR and KAAR. Empirical experiments suggest that, in general, these new methods perform as good as or better than both KRR and KAAR. In the second part of this dissertation we deal with a more difficult problem— we allow the dependence of outcomes on signals to change with time. To handle this we propose two new methods: WeCKAAR and KAARCh. WeCKAAR is a simple modification of one of our methods from {{the first part of the}} dissertation to include decaying weights. KAARCh is an application of the AA to the case where the experts are all the predictors that can change with time. We show that KAARCh suffers a cumulative loss that is almost as good as that of any expert that does not change very rapidly. Empirical results on data with changing dependencies demonstrate that WeCKAAR and KAARCh perform well in practice and are considerably better than Kernel Ridge Regression...|$|E
