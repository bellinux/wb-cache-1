5|$|Similar to its predecessor, Watch Dogs 2 is an action-adventure {{game with}} stealth {{elements}} and played from a third-person perspective as protagonist Marcus Holloway, a young hacker, the game features an open world environment {{set in a}} fictionalized version of the San Francisco Bay Area, an area {{more than twice as}} large as the Chicago setting from Watch Dogs. The Bay Area consists of four different areas: San Francisco, Oakland, Marin, and Silicon Valley, all of which have different characteristics and aesthetics. Players can navigate the game's world on-foot or by the various vehicles featured in the game, such as cars, trucks, buses, cable cars, motorcycles, quad bikes and boats. The driving mechanic was overhauled and designed to be more accessible. The players can shoot their weapons while driving. Marcus also has improved acrobatic skills, and the ability to parkour around the city. Players can use different methods to approach the game's missions, choosing between the aggressive approach, in which they defeat enemies with guns which are made with a 3D printer; explosives, like mines; or Marcus' own melee weapon, a billiard ball attached to a <b>bungee</b> <b>cord.</b> Alternatively, players can use the stealth approach, in which they can evade enemies or paralyze them temporarily with Marcus' taser. Players can also complete the game through hacking alone. When players commit too many crimes, the police officers will become alerted and will attempt to arrest the player. The game upgrades system is a returning feature, with items being divided into three categories: Ghost, Aggressor, and Trickster. Players can choose their upgrades in accordance with their own playstyle.|$|E
25|$|Initial trials {{revealed}} {{a lack of}} longitudinal control, and the single-acting ailerons caused problems when taxying downwind, so the two prototype were fitted with lengths of <b>bungee</b> <b>cord</b> attached to control horns on the upper aileron surface to return the aileron to the neutral position. This only produced a marginal improvement, so ailerons were then added to the lower wings, these being fitted to all the aircraft built apart from the two prototypes. These were linked by cables to the upper ailerons, and the <b>bungee</b> <b>cord</b> to return the ailerons was rigged between {{the top of the}} rear interplane struts and the lower ailerons.|$|E
25|$|Bungee ending: This {{is similar}} to the first, but a <b>bungee</b> <b>cord</b> can be seen {{attached}} to Goldman's leg. Goldman returns to where he was and belches. This ending is achieved by typing a combination of honest and untruthful or strange answers to questions asked in the boss fight.|$|E
50|$|In early playings, {{batteries}} were 20 points each, and {{the adults}} were harnessed into <b>bungee</b> <b>cords</b> when they threw the gunge. The <b>bungee</b> <b>cords</b> were dropped in later playings.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bungee</b> <b>cords</b> {{have been}} used to provide a {{lightweight}} suspension for aircraft undercarriages from before World War I, and are still used on many small homebuilt aircraft where weight remains critical. [...] <b>Bungee</b> <b>cords</b> were also used in parachuting to assist in opening the old-style parachute container after the ripcord was pulled.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bungee</b> <b>cords</b> {{have also}} been used to make bungee chairs and for other purposes.|$|R
25|$|The SG 38 was {{designed}} to be a training glider for basic flight training by the Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps (NSFK). The usual launch method was by <b>bungee</b> <b>cord</b> from a sloped hill. Because training was conducted solely by solo flight the aircraft had to be very easy to fly and also easy to repair.|$|E
25|$|The sole {{surviving}} English Electric Wren (G-EBNV) flies occasionally at the Shuttleworth Collection at Old Warden and {{is powered}} by an ABC 8hp engine. With barely enough power to maintain flight the aircraft is assisted into the air {{by a team of}} volunteers using <b>bungee</b> <b>cord,</b> after which the Wren lands straight ahead following a short 'hop'.|$|E
25|$|In the Dreamcast version, {{there are}} six extreme sports {{including}} bungee jumping and skysurfing. Players {{will have the opportunity}} to skirt down the side of mountain vistas and surf through the air on a snowboard, barrel over rocky trails on an all-terrain vehicle (ATV), hurtle off bridges on a <b>bungee</b> <b>cord,</b> hang glide through canyons and crevices, and race on a mountain bike.|$|E

5000|$|In less {{sophisticated}} solutions, <b>bungee</b> <b>cords</b> {{can be used}} as a cheap isolation system which may be effective enough for some applications. The item to be isolated is suspended from the <b>bungee</b> <b>cords.</b> This is difficult to implement without a danger of the isolated item falling. Tennis balls cut in half have been used under washing machines and other items with some success.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bungee</b> <b>cords</b> are a {{major source}} of eye injury and doctors suggest not using them.|$|R
25|$|The {{alternative}} is to donate the primary demand valve that the donor is currently breathing from, {{on the principle that}} it is known to be working and is immediately recognizable and accessible. The donor, who should be less stressed, will then switch to the secondary demand valve, which in this arrangement is generally mounted on a loop of <b>bungee</b> <b>cord</b> which hangs on the neck, and keeps the secondary demand valve tucked up under the diver's chin, where it can often be reached without the use of the hands, by bending the head forward and gripping the mouthpiece with the teeth.|$|E
25|$|Early {{marks of}} the Whitley {{featured}} bomb bay doors, fitted on both the fuselage and wing bays, that were held shut by bungee cords; during bombing operations, these were opened {{by the weight of}} the bombs as they fell on them and closed again by the <b>bungee</b> <b>cord.</b> The short and unpredictable delay for the doors to open led to highly inaccurate bombing. The Mk.III introduced hydraulically actuated doors which greatly improved bombing accuracy. To aim bombs, the bomb aimer opened a hatch in the nose of the aircraft, which extended the bomb sight out of the fuselage but the Mk IV replaced this hatch with a slightly extended transparent plexiglas panel, improving crew comfort.|$|E
500|$|Cast member Jonathan Frakes {{directed}} the episode, having {{prepared for it}} while shooting the episode [...] "". He {{said that he was}} not involved in the casting process, as they had offered the role of Captain Morgan Bateson to Kelsey Grammer, who'd accepted. Grammer was a Star Trek fan, and in his role as Frasier Crane on Cheers, he filmed on the Paramount lot near where The Next Generation was produced. Frakes found it a challenge to film the same scenes with the same dialogue over and over but in a way which made them look different. Marvin V. Rush, the director of photography, worked with cameraman Waverly Smothers to develop an attachment for a camera using a <b>bungee</b> <b>cord</b> which allowed for a different style of shooting. Frakes also worked while at home planning out shots {{in order to ensure that}} there was a variety to each loop. Executive producer Rick Berman had made it clear that Frakes could not re-use footage and each loop needed to be filmed fresh, in order to prevent the episode from looking like a clip show.|$|E

50|$|A bungee {{trampoline}} is {{a mechanical}} amusement attraction which contains a support structure of 3 to 8 m in height or 10 to 26 feet, a pulley system to anchor and retract <b>bungee</b> <b>cords,</b> a trampoline the jumper will bounce on, a harness {{to attach the}} jumper to the cords and structure, and a winch—either electric or manual—to put tension on the <b>bungee</b> <b>cords</b> by pulling on them through the pulleys.|$|R
5000|$|Today, <b>bungee</b> <b>cords</b> {{are most}} often used to secure objects without tying knots and to absorb shock. Inexpensive <b>bungee</b> <b>cords,</b> with metal or plastic hooks on each end, are marketed as a general utility item. This form {{is also known as}} kangaroo, octopus, or [...] "occy", straps in Australia. These can be an {{individual}} strap, or a set of four hooked straps held together by a metal ring allowing the occy strap to secure items around various tie points, for example a suitcase to a car roof rack. Extensions of the concept are available as a coarse net of <b>bungee</b> <b>cords</b> with metal or plastic hooks around the periphery, for securing irregularly shaped loads of luggage and cargo on the backs of pickup trucks, roofs of cars, and so on.|$|R
500|$|By {{the fifth}} orbit, Schirra {{had begun to}} relax, commenting {{that it was the}} first rest he had had since December 1961. He used a small <b>bungee</b> <b>cord</b> {{exercise}} device for [...] "a little bit of stretching", before dropping into manual attitude control, where he reported a sudden burst of oversteering and high fuel use. Over the Atlantic he returned to observation and photography; he failed to spot the planned high-power light near Durban, in South Africa, due to cloud cover, but did make out the brightly lit city of Port Elizabeth. Over the Philippines, he reported on his fuel status; after four and a half of the planned six orbits, he still had eighty percent remaining in both manual and automatic fuel tanks. Passing over Quito, Ecuador, towards the end of his fifth orbit, Schirra was asked by the tracking station if he had any message to pass on [...] "in Spanish to the fellows down here", and he made some comments on how beautiful the country appeared from orbit, ending with a cheery [...] "Buenos Dias, y'all!" [...] Schirra later noted that he was [...] "furious" [...] at this point—he was preparing for re-entry and didn't want to be distracted with making public statements.|$|E
2500|$|Sling Shot: A <b>bungee</b> <b>cord</b> ride {{in which}} two riders sat in a seat and were {{strapped}} in while the ride was shot {{up in the air}} and supported by a <b>bungee</b> <b>cord.</b> Riders looped upside down. There are a few similar rides still standing in a handful of major amusement parks, the most common name being the Slingshot found at many Six Flags parks, but they are upcharge attractions (an additional charge to admission) due to insurance issues. At Action Park, the extra fee was only $5. This particular ride was open from 1993 to 1995. [...] "We often wondered how many whiplash cases came out of that ride", one former employee recalled.|$|E
2500|$|The little engine {{probably}} {{did not have enough}} power to get the Budig airborne but was used to maintain altitude or decrease the sink rate; launches were made with the usual <b>bungee</b> <b>cord</b> catapult. Nonetheless, Flight noted it as [...] " [...] probably the first glider with an auxiliary engine to fly".|$|E

2500|$|All bicycle rack-equipped {{cars have}} a yellow [...] "Bike Car" [...] sign posted by the door. Cyclists are {{required}} to tie their bicycle to the rack with the <b>bungee</b> <b>cord</b> provided, and must be racked so they do not protrude into the aisle. Each rack can accommodate four bicycles. Because the bikes are stacked together against the racks, most riders place a destination tag, available from a conductor, on their bicycles to optimize placement and minimize shuffling.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: Figure 6-4. The first U.S. “treadmill” {{utilized}} during spaceflight was {{a passive}} device used {{only on the}} Skylab 4 mission of 84 d duration. The high loading (175 lbs) via <b>bungee</b> <b>cords</b> provided more of a resistive rather than an aerobic modality. It consisted of a Teflon-coated aluminum plate attached to the Skylab isogrid floor. The exercising crewmember wore a waist and shoulder harness that attached to the iso-grid floor surrounding the treadmill plate by means of 4 <b>bungee</b> <b>cords.</b> Socks had to be worn to provide a low-friction interface between the plantar surface of the feet and the Teflon-coated treadmill plate. From reference.|$|R

2500|$|The US Coast Guard has {{deployed}} the MH-68A to its {{newly created}} Helicopter Interdiction Tactical Squadron (HITRON), {{and it is}} the only helicopter in USCG inventory specifically tasked with the Airborne Use of Force (AUF) mission. These helicopters feature a defensive armament system composed of a single M240G mounted at the port cabin door, along with a Robar Arms RC-50 rifle attached to the cabin via a <b>bungee</b> <b>cord</b> for disabling hostile light vessels. [...] The kit is also capable of being used on the HH-65C aircraft. When so fitted the aircraft is designated MH-65C.|$|E
2500|$|The E.115 {{appeared}} in 1937 with significant {{changes to the}} wing. The span was only slightly reduced (by 200mm or 7.9in) but continuous taper reduced the area by 20%. The ailerons were fabric covered. It could be powered by either the Praga B or D and was noticeably faster than earlier variants, even with the smaller engine. The E.115 also had a revised undercarriage, with single, streamlined steel struts hinged to the lower fuselage braced by [...] rods to the centre section. The wheels were spatted and the legs sprung with <b>bungee</b> <b>cord</b> inside the fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|Larger outdoor {{models are}} usually {{radio-controlled}} gliders that are piloted remotely {{from the ground}} with a transmitter. These can remain airborne for extended periods by using the lift produced by slopes and thermals. These can be winched into wind by a line attached to a hook under the fuselage with a ring, so that the line will drop when the model is overhead. Other methods of launching include towing aloft using a model powered aircraft, catapult-launching using an elastic <b>bungee</b> <b>cord</b> and hand-launching. When hand-launching the newer [...] "discus" [...] style of wing-tip hand-launching has largely supplanted the earlier [...] "javelin" [...] type of launch.|$|E
5000|$|Contenders and Gladiators face {{one another}} on <b>bungee</b> <b>cords.</b> Contenders have sixty seconds to deposit as many balls as {{possible}} into their goal basket, which the gladiators have to defend. Two points are scored by the contender for each [...] "goal".|$|R
