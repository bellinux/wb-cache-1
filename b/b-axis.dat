The crystal structure consists of SO42−, 2(N+H3CH2COOH) (G1 and G2 in the crystal-structure diagram), and +NH3CH2COO− (G3) species held together by hydrogen bonds. These bonds are easily broken by the polar molecules of water that explains the hygroscopicity of TGS - its crystals are easily etched by water.

There are four distinct oxygen atoms in the structure. O2 is a bridging oxygen shared between two tetrahedra, and O1 is a non-silicate oxygen (not bonded to Si). The potentially hydrated O1 atom lies at the center of four edge-sharing Mg2+ octahedra (Smyth, 1987, 1994). If this oxygen is hydrated (protonated), a Mg vacancy can occur at M3.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a turning process is {{presented}} which {{is enhanced by}} a third tool movement axis. Besides the two already existing translational X- and Z-axes an additional rotational axis {{is added to the}} process. This is realized by integrating the already existing but yet unused <b>B-axis</b> of 5 -axis turn-/mill-centers into the turning process. By moving the <b>B-axis</b> simultaneously during turning operations it is possible to adapt the tool/ workpiece engagement arbitrary to the individual machining case. Thus, the flexibility and the efficiency of turning can be increased significantly. This gives major benefits regarding tool consumption and machining time when turning geometrical complex parts made of hard to machine materials such as turbomachinery components. To gain a basic understanding of simultaneous three axis turning it is investigated which effect the additional tool movement has on the turning process regarding uncut chip parameters, process forces and tool wear development. Process parameters of the <b>B-axis</b> like rotational speed, rotational range and direction of rotation are varied. It is shown that the uncut chip geometry in three axis turning differs from the geometry in conventional turning. Especially the rotational speed and the direction of rotation have a major effect on the shape and size of the uncut chip. Besides this, the process forces are also affected by the <b>B-axis</b> movement. While the process forces are constant in conventional turning, these alter over time in three axis turning. It can be observed that the process forces are significantly shifted towards higher and lower levels in dependence of the rotational speed and direction. This effect increases with decreasing tool cutting edge angles. However, the influence of the <b>B-axis</b> movement on the tool wear is also investigated. It is shown that the tool wear can be distributed arbitrarily over the tool edge by changing the position of the <b>B-axis.</b> Thus, the tool life can be more than doubled...|$|E

40|$|Particle size {{frequency}} distributions {{are usually}} obtained by sieving bulk samples of sediment. In {{the case of}} surface samples, this is often impractical because particles can be fairly large. Consequently, various particle size axes or dimensions are measured to determine the equivalent sieve size. The Wolman pebble count is commonly used to sample the surface particle size distribution of gravel-bed rivers. Typically, 100 individual particles are selected from the streambed and the intermediate axis of each particle is measured. The standard practice is to measure the maximum dimensions of three mutually perpendicular axes, with the largest dimension being the a-axis, the intermediate the <b>b-axis,</b> and the smallest the c-axis. Since most streambed particles approximate ellipsoids, the b-dimension is an acceptable predictor of nominal diameter.

40|$|Controlling {{material}} properties by modulating the crystalline structure has been attempted using various techniques, e. g., hydrostatic pressure, chemical pressure, and epitaxy. These techniques succeed to improve properties and achieve desired functionalities {{by changing the}} unit cell in all dimensions. In order to obtain a more detailed understanding on {{the relation between the}} crystal lattice and {{material properties}}, it is desirable to investigate the influence of a smaller number of parameters. Here, we utilize the combination of chemical pressure and epitaxy to modify a single lattice parameter of the multiferroic orthorhombic RMnO_ 3 (R = rare-earth, o-RMnO_ 3) system. By growing a series of o-RMnO_ 3 (R = Gd - Lu) films coherently on (010) -oriented YAlO_ 3 substrates, the influence of chemical pressure is reflected only along the <b>b-axis.</b> Thus, a series of o-RMnO_ 3 with a 5. 18 Å, 5. 77 Å < b < 5. 98 Å, and c 7. 37 Å were obtained.

40|$|Symmetry {{protected}} Dirac semimetals can {{be transformed}} into Weyl semimetals by breaking the protecting symmetry, leading to many exotic quantum phenomena such as chiral anomaly and anomalous Hall effect. Here we show that, due to the large Zeeman g factor and small band width along <b>b-axis</b> in Dirac semimetal ZrTe 5, a magnetic field of about 8 T along <b>b-axis</b> direction may annihilate the Weyl points and open up a two-dimensional (2 D) Dirac mass gap, when the Zeeman splitting exceeds the band width along <b>b-axis.</b> This is manifested by a sharp drop of magnetoresistance (MR) above 8 T, which is probably due to additional carriers induced by the orbital splitting of the zeroth Landau level associated with the 2 D Dirac point, which is descendant of the original Weyl points.

40|$|Iron-based high {{temperature}} superconductivity develops when the `parent' antiferromagnetic/orthorhombic phase is suppressed, typically by introduction of dopant atoms. But {{their impact on}} atomic-scale electronic structure, while in theory quite complex, is unknown experimentally. What is known is that a strong transport anisotropy with its resistivity maximum along the crystal <b>b-axis,</b> develops with increasing concentration of dopant atoms; this `nematicity' vanishes when the `parent' phase disappears near the maximum superconducting Tc. The interplay between the electronic structure surrounding each dopant atom, quasiparticle scattering therefrom, and the transport nematicity has therefore become a pivotal focus of research into these materials. Here, by directly visualizing the atomic-scale electronic structure, we show that substituting Co for Fe atoms in underdoped Ca(Fe 1 -xCox) 2 As 2 generates a dense population of identical anisotropic impurity states. Each is ~ 8 Fe-Fe unit cells in length, and all are distributed randomly but aligned with the antiferromagnetic a-axis. By imaging their surrounding interference patterns, we further demonstrate that these impurity states scatter quasiparticles in a highly anisotropic manner, with the maximum scattering rate concentrated along the <b>b-axis.</b> These data provide direct support for the recent proposals that it is primarily anisotropic scattering by dopant-induced impurity states that generates the transport nematicity; they also yield simple explanations for the enhancement of the nematicity proportional to the dopant density and for the occurrence of the highest resistivity along the <b>b-axis...</b>|$|E
