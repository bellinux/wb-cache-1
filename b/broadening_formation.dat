40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} if magic angle spinning (MAS) 1 H NMR {{can be used}} as a {{tool for}} detection of liquid-ordered domains (rafts) in membranes. In experiments with the lipids SOPC, DOPC, DPPC, and cholesterol we demonstrated that 1 H MAS NMR spectra of liquid-ordered domains (lo) are distinctly different from liquid-disordered (ld) and solid-ordered (so) membrane regions. At a MAS frequency of 10 kHz the methylene proton resonance of hydrocarbon chains in the ld phase has a linewidth of ∼ 50 Hz. The corresponding linewidth is ∼ 1 kHz for the lo phase and several kHz for the so phase. According to results of 1 H NMR dipolar echo spectroscopy, the broadening of MAS resonances in the lo phase results from an increase in effective strength of intramolecular proton dipolar interactions between adjacent methylene groups, most likely because of a lower probability of gauche/trans isomerization in lo. In spectra recorded as a function of temperature, the onset of lo domain (raft) formation is seen as a sudden onset of line <b>broadening.</b> <b>Formation</b> of small domains yielded homogenously broadened resonance lines, whereas large lo domains (diameter > 0. 3 μm) in an ld environment resulted in superposition of the narrow resonances of the ld phase and the much broader resonances of lo. 1 H MAS NMR may be applied to detection of rafts in cell membranes...|$|E

In 2009 Bob English also anchored the bands in a TradeStation version of the indicator. Andrew Coles created the bands in Metastock in 2011 while also replacing the VWAP formula with the MIDAS formula.Coles has cautioned against excessive use of this indicator while suggesting that its application be restricted to technical patterns known as <b>Broadening</b> <b>Formations</b> or to sharp, angular prices moves springing out of low volatility conditions or as part of zigzag price formations. This restriction is argued {{to be based on the}} main drawback of the indicator to fan out from asset prices much too quickly and much too excessively.|$|R

40|$|The {{interfacial}} adsorption {{layers of}} gelatin at a benzene/gelatin solution in D 2 O interface were studied by NMR using the oil-in-water emulsions prepared by ultrasonic dispersion in conditions where the gelatin macromolecules {{are in a}} coiled conformation. The intensities of the proton signals from the gelatin decreased and the NMR spectral lines <b>broadened</b> upon the <b>formation</b> of interfacial adsorption layers of gelatin (T > 313 K). The result {{is similar to that}} of collagen-like helices and gels of gelatin and shows that the fraction of mobile gelatin segments in interfacial adsorption layers decreases virtually to zero.

40|$|We {{investigate}} general {{properties of}} the interferograms from a frequency comb laser in a non-linear dispersive medium. The focus is on interferograms at large delay distances and in particular on their <b>broadening,</b> the fringe <b>formation</b> and shape. It is observed that at large delay distances the interferograms spread linearly and that its shape {{is determined by the}} source spectral profile. It is also shown that each intensity point of the interferogram is formed by the contribution of one dominant stationary frequency. This stationary frequency is seen to vary {{as a function of the}} path length difference even within the interferogram. We also show that the contributing stationary frequency remains constant if the evolution of a particular fringe is followed in the successive interferograms found periodically at different path length differences. This can be used to measure very large distances in dispersive media. IST/Imaging Science and TechnologyApplied Science...|$|R
40|$|Undoped ZnO single {{crystals}} {{were implanted}} with aluminum ions up to {{a dose of}} 1015 Al+/cm 2. Vacancy defects in the implanted layers were detected using positron lifetime and Doppler broadening measurements with slow positron beams. It shows that vacancy clusters, which {{are close to the}} size of V 8, are generated by implantation. Postimplantation annealing shows that the Doppler broadening S parameter increases in the temperature range from 200 °C to 600 °C suggesting further agglomeration of vacancy clusters to voids. Detailed analyses of Doppler <b>broadening</b> spectra show <b>formation</b> of positronium after 600 °C annealing of the implanted samples with doses higher than 1014 Al+/cm 2. Positron lifetime measurements further suggest that the void diameter is about 0. 8 nm. The voids disappear and the vacancy concentration reaches the detection limit after annealing at 600 – 900 °C. Hall measurement shows that the implanted Al+ ions are fully activated with improved carrier mobility after final annealing. Cathodoluminescence measurements show that the ultraviolet luminescence is much stronger than the unimplanted state. These findings also suggest that the electrical and optical properties of ZnO become much better by Al+ implantation and subsequent annealing...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of specific phase-separated morphologies {{is central to}} achieving high performance polyurethanes. Polyurethanes are composed of various structural elements possessing a mixture of different functional groups, molecular weights, and sequence lengths. The chemistry, the phase behavior, and the kinetics of phase evolution will influence the type of phase-separated morphology formed. In fact, the phase behavior also depends upon the chemical structure and the molecular weight distribution of the components. Despite the importance of chemical structure, {{it is still not}} understood quantitatively. In addition, little is known about how the developing structure organizes into different phase-separated morphologies. ^ The work herein addresses these issues. The molecular weight distributions, end groups, and linkages of polyurethane structural elements were quantitatively determined. The structural elements included polyether and polyester macrodiols, polyurethane prepolymers, and polyurea hard segments. Under homogeneous conditions, the molecular weight distribution formed obeys a Schultz-Flory distribution; although when toluene diisocyanates are used as the diisocyanate the effect of change in reactivity narrows the distribution. Under heterogeneous conditions, the phase separation of water causes a change in the local stoichiometry and narrows the distribution further. In the presence of typical polyurethane side reactions, the distribution is <b>broadened.</b> The <b>formation</b> of allophanate linkages was most prevalent in PPG prepolymers prepared at reaction temperatures of 145 °C. ^ Infrared spectroscopy was used to study the crystallization behavior of semicrystalline polyurethanes and the reaction and morphological evolution of polyurethane foams. Hydrogen bonding between urethane groups was shown to influence all aspects of the crystallization behavior, including the initial state, nucleation and growth rates, and the final morphology. Hydrogen bonding proves to be less crucial in the onset of phase separation in polyurethane foams. The most crucial parameter was shown to be hard segment anisotropy. Foams prepared from diisocyanates yielding highly anisotropic hard segments phase separate at lower reaction conversion, with a faster rate, and to a higher degree of phase separation and perfection. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{plasmonic}} properties of coupled noble-metal nanochains {{in the case}} of different number of coupled chains and doping by different transition-metal (TM) atoms within the time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) approach. We find that as the number of chains in the array increases the plasmon peak shifts from the sub-eV towards the visible range. As doping with TM atoms increases, the visible absorption band <b>broadens,</b> owing to <b>formation</b> of additional plasmon peaks. The optical response is very sensitive to the type of doped atoms, their number and position; in particular, the additional peaks are most pronounced {{in the case of}} weak doping when they correspond to local plasmon oscillations around the impurity atom. These effects have a potential to be used in various modern technologies, from sensors to solar cells. Most of the studies of nano-plasmon effects have been focused on alkali- and noble-metal systems with extended s-electron states, while it was believed that doping with TM atoms with their more localized charge as a rule leads to an attenuation of the plasmon modes. We demonstrate that TM atoms can play a constructive role in plasmon generation in small chain systems, and that plasmonic modes can emerge even in some pure TM nanochains...|$|R
40|$|Optical and {{structural}} properties of reactive ion beam sputter deposited CeO 2 films {{as a function}} of oxygen partial pressures (P-O 2) and substrate temperatures (T-s) have been investigated. The films deposited at ambient temperature with P-O 2 of 0. 01 Pa have shown a refractive index of 2. 36 which increased to 2. 44 at 400 degrees C. Refractive index and extinction coefficient are sensitive up to a T-s of similar to 200 degrees C. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) have been used to characterise the structural properties. A preferential orientation of (220) was observed up to a T-s of 200 degrees C and it changed to (200) at 400 degrees C: and above. Raman line broadening, peak shift and XRD <b>broadening</b> indicate the <b>formation</b> of nanocrystalline phase for the films deposited up to a substrate temperature of 300 degrees C. However, crystallinity of the films were better for T-s values above 300 degrees C. In general both optical {{and structural}} properties were unusual compared to the films deposited by conventional electron beam evaporation, but were similar in some aspects to those deposited by ion-assisted deposition. Apart from thermal effects, this behavior is also attributed to the bombardment of backscattered ions/neutrals on the growing film as well as the higher kinetic energy of the condensing species, together resulting in increased packing density.

40|$|The {{mixing of}} Au in Si induced by {{secondary}} and high-order recoil implantation was investigated using 350 keV Ar + and 350 keV Kr + ions to fluences from 1 ?×? 10 16 to 3 ?×? 10 16 ions/cm 2 at room temperature. The {{thickness of the}} Au layer evaporated on Si substrate was ~ 2400. The ranges of the Ar and Kr ions were chosen to be lower than {{the thickness of the}} Au layer {{in order to avoid the}} ballistic mixing produced by the primary knock-on atoms. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) experiments were carried out to study the effects induced by Ar and Kr irradiation at the interface of Au-Si system. We observed that in the case of the irradiation with Ar + ions, a broadening of the Au-Si interface occurred only at the fluence of 3 ?×? 10 16 Ar + /cm 2 and it is attributed to the surface roughening induced by ion bombardment. In contrast, the RBS analysis of a sample irradiated with 2 ?×? 10 16 Kr + /cm 2 clearly showed, in addition to the <b>broadening</b> effect, the <b>formation</b> of a mixed zone of Au and Si atoms at the interface. The mixing of Au in Si atoms can be explained by the secondary and high-order recoil implantation followed by subsequent collision cascade...|$|R
40|$|Archival IUE {{spectra of}} the VY Sculptoris system MV Lyrae, taken during an {{intermediate}} state, can be best fit by an isothermal accretion disk extending half-way to the tidal cutoff radius. In contrast, a recent HST spectrum, while MV Lyr {{was in a}} high state, can be best fit with a standard T(R) profile for an accretion disk extending from an inner truncation radius to an intermediate radius with an isothermal accretion disk beyond. These fits use component-star parameters determined from a study of MV Lyr in a low state. Model systems containing accretion disks with standard T(R) profiles have continua that are too blue. The observed high-state absorption-line spectrum exhibits excitation higher than provided by the T(R) profile, indicating likely line formation in a high-temperature region extending vertically above the accretion disk. The absorption lines show a blueshift and line <b>broadening</b> corresponding to <b>formation</b> in a low-velocity wind apparently coextensive with the high-temperature region. Lines of N v, Si IV, C IV, and He II are anomalously strong relative to our synthetic spectra, indicating possible composition effects, but unmodeled excitation effects could also produce the anomalies. An analysis of a low state of MV Lyr, considered in an earlier study and extended in this paper, sets a limit of 2500 K for the T-eff of an accretion disk that may {{be present in the}} low state. This limit is in conflict with two recent models of the VY Sculptoris phenomenon. ...|$|R
40|$|High yield {{synthesis}} of carbon nanotubes in activated carbon by Ni-catalyzed {{chemical vapor deposition}} is demonstrated and a parametric study {{on the effect of}} the most crucial experimental conditions on the growth is performed. Reaction temperature, time and carbon precursor flow rate were systematically varied and their influence on nanotube size, uniformity, density, growth rate, and yield was evaluated. In situ monitoring of growth evolution was achieved by a microbalance system connected on-line to the reaction zone. The porous structure of the support provides high surface area for catalyst particle deposition and improved catalyst particle dispersion properties, while its composition appeared to enhance nanotube yield. The resulting carbon nanotube-loaded activated carbons were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, while the pore transformation after nanotube growth was evaluated by mercury and nitrogen porosimetry. A strong effect of the reaction temperature was found on nanotube growth leading to an optimal value of 750 degrees C, while for a reaction duration longer than 5 min the growth rate was continuously suppressed, the nanotube size distribution was <b>broaden,</b> and the <b>formation</b> of amorphous carbon was favored. Controlled oxidation experiments on the outer surface of the impregnated activated carbon support were performed in order to remove outer layers and observe the catalyst morphology, content, and activity in the inner parts of the material. The composites produced in the present work, combining the exciting characteristics of carbon nanotubes with those of activated carbon, are anticipated to {{contribute to the development of}} novel composite materials based on carbon nanotubes with enhanced physical, chemical and electronic characteristics for important applications such as in catalysis, energy, and environment.

40|$|Blue supergiant {{stars are}} known to display {{photometric}} and spectroscopic variability that is suggested {{to be linked to}} stellar pulsations. Pulsational activity in massive stars strongly depends on the star's evolutionary stage and is assumed to be connected with mass-loss episodes, the appearance of macroturbulent line <b>broadening,</b> and the <b>formation</b> of clumps in the wind. To investigate a possible interplay between pulsations and mass-loss, we carried out an observational campaign of the supergiant 55 Cyg over a period of five years to search for photospheric activity and cyclic mass-loss variability in the stellar wind. We modeled the H, He I, Si II and Si III lines using the nonlocal thermal equilibrium atmosphere code FASTWIND and derived the photospheric and wind parameters. In addition, we searched for variability in the intensity and radial velocity of photospheric lines and performed a moment analysis of the line profiles to derive frequencies and amplitudes of the variations. The Halpha line varies with time in both intensity and shape, displaying various types of profiles: P Cygni, pure emission, almost complete absence, and double or multiple peaked. The star undergoes episodes of variable mass-loss rates that change by a factor of 1. 7 - 2 on different timescales. We also observe changes in the ionization rate of Si II and determine a multiperiodic oscillation in the He I absorption lines, with periods ranging from a few hours to 22. 5 days. We interpret the photospheric line variations in terms of oscillations in p-, g-, and strange modes. We suggest that these pulsations can lead to phases of enhanced mass loss. Furthermore, they can mislead the determination of the stellar rotation. We classify the star as a post-red supergiant, belonging to the group of alpha Cyg variables.
