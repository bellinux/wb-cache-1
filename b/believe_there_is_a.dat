25|$|Today, theism {{is losing}} {{prevalence}} in Europe {{in favour of}} atheism and agnosticism, and religion is losing prevalence in favour of secularism. European countries have experienced a decline in church attendance {{as well as a}} {{decline in the number of}} people professing a religious belief.

500|$|Within 48 {{hours of}} taking over, Butler {{organized}} raids {{on more than}} 900 speakeasies, ordering them padlocked and, in many cases, destroyed. In addition to raiding the speakeasies, he also attempted to eliminate other illegal activities: bootlegging, prostitution, gambling, and police corruption. More zealous than he was political, he ordered crackdowns on the social elite's favorite hangouts, such as the Ritz-Carlton and the Union League, {{as well as on}} drinking establishments that served the working class. Although he was effective in reducing crime and police corruption, he was a controversial leader. In one instance he made a statement that he would promote the first officer to kill a bandit and stated, [...] "I don't <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> single bandit notch on a policeman's guns [...] in this city, go out and get some."

[...] He went home to Knoxville to reflect on {{swimming}} and life in general. He told his parents {{that he could not}} stand hearing coverage of the Olympics, so his father quickly organized a vacation to Costa Rica. After returning home, Tarwater's uncle, Richmond Flowers Jr., was able to help him through the experience. [...] In 1968, Flowers had been a gold medal favorite in the hurdles before suffering a hamstring injury two months before the Olympic Trials. [...] "I think he knew the pain I was feeling and the disappointment I was feeling, because he felt same thing," [...] Tarwater recalled. Flowers offered perspective, instead of comfort: [...] "I <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> God who created this, and it ain't no accident.

500|$|There {{are several}} uses for {{employing}} economic weapons against one country or another. One use for using economic weapons would concern the seller/buyer bargaining on {{the conditions of}} a business contract. This would include price, transportation, timetable for consignment and payment, etc. [...] Although {{this is an example}} of the successful application of food power, it is not a political objective. Another use concerns the economic objectives other than these relating to the transaction of goods; to the general economic policy of the buyer. This would be balance of payments, general problems, such as inflation or taxation and land holding. [...] What distinguishes this from the first is the fact that there is no link between the conditions laid down and the transfer of product. The conditions refer to the economic realm of life. [...] A political use would be one concerning the buyer’s foreign and defense policies. [...] Many <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> moral threshold between economy and politics, making the use of economic means for political gains questionable. [...] Examples of the use of economic weapons for political aims are boycotts against certain countries as well as the buying of votes in the UN. A fourth purpose pertains to the basic assumption of the third category: the governments no longer accept each other as legitimate. [...] The economic goals are no longer seen as a means of influencing an opposite government but rather to stimulate opposition and achieve the overthrow or capitulation of the government.|$|E
500|$|My lads, {{you must}} all have {{observed}} the great {{increase in the}} enemy's force, and the threatening posture they have assumed.

We {{are in a position to}} defend ourselves against regular troops, far less a set of naked savages, with their spears and krisses. It is true they have swivels in their boats, but they cannot act here. I have not observed that they have any muskets, but if they have, so have we. When we were first thrown on shore we could only muster seventy-five musket ball cartridges [...] we now have sixteen hundred. They cannot send up, I believe, more than five hundred men; but with two hundred such as now stand around me, I do not fear a thousand [...] nor fifteen hundred of them. The pikemen standing firm, we will give them such a volley of musketry as they will be little prepared for; and when they are thrown into confusion, we will sally out, chase them into the water, and ten to one but we secure their vessels. let every man be on the alert, and should these barbarians this night attempt our hill, I trust we shall convince them they are dealing with Britons.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim, {{with many}} critics praising {{the return of}} Mac and the increased role of peripheral characters, the resolution to the rape mystery, and the setup of the next major story arc. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8 out of 10, indicating that it was [...] "great". He wrote that [...] "Spit & Eggs" [...] was a welcome episode for longtime fans, as it involved several plots converging {{in a way that}} he found satisfactory. He praised the final few scenes, writing that the episode transitions well into the next mystery of Dean O'Dell's death by developing it slowly {{over the course of the}} season's prior episodes, but he was more mixed towards the reveal of Mercer as the rapist, commenting [...] "the ultimate revelation can't help but be a little underwhelming, since not enough time has been spent on any of the credible suspects to really have a good handle on them or be invested in them one way or another." [...] Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, who was quite critical of the rape storyline in earlier episodes, said that the conclusion made the storyline slightly better overall. He praised the double reveal of Mercer and Moe as accomplices, stating, [...] "That twist overall is effective because it plays on everyone's expectations. The characters all <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> single culprit here. [...] It makes the revelations more plausible, while also making the need for those revelations less intense (the two are related)." ...|$|E
