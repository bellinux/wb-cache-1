5000|$|The [...] "Sportsnet PPV" [...] {{name was}} not {{originally}} used on-air, as individual packages and programs were marketed directly by participating service providers. Following its expansion to general-interest programming, the service launched a <b>barker</b> <b>channel</b> which promotes special events under the Sportsnet PPV brand, {{as well as}} adult programming under the Adult4U brand. Unlike Viewers Choice and most other pay-per-view services in Canada, the service does not carry mass-market movies, though its <b>barker</b> <b>channel</b> shows previews of movies which are promoted as being available through individual cable companies' video on demand services.|$|E
50|$|Sneak Prevue was an American basic {{cable and}} {{satellite}} television network {{that served as a}} <b>barker</b> <b>channel</b> to provide previews of pay-per-view films and events to cable television providers. The channel launched in 1991 and existed until 2002.|$|E
50|$|<b>Barker</b> <b>channels</b> are {{normally}} free-to-view or occasionally free-to-air, {{even without a}} subscription; this also indicates success in the installation of satellite systems, and particularly in aiming small satellite dishes.|$|R

50|$|In its Prevue incarnation, {{the channel}} {{operated}} a sister barker service, Sneak Prevue, which provided information on pay-per-view programming along with ordering information; the service operated until 2002 (three {{years after its}} parent network evolved into the TV Guide Channel), {{as a result of}} the rise in in-house <b>barker</b> <b>channels</b> operated by pay-per-view services to promote their content.|$|R
50|$|Several barker {{channels}} {{exist on}} digital cable systems, and especially on direct broadcast satellite {{systems such as}} DirecTV. On interactive television systems, these also allow for ordering of pay-per-view program selections or other pay television services. Prior to its 2008 purchase by Lions Gate Entertainment and subsequent conversion into a general entertainment channel (eventually leading to its rebranding as Pop in January 2015), the TV Guide Network - along with featuring listings for upcoming programs - functioned essentially as a <b>barker</b> <b>channel</b> with film and program descriptions. During its years as Prevue Guide/Channel, it served as a <b>barker</b> <b>channel</b> outright, incorporating video program promotions and short-form film trailers at {{the top half of}} the screen.|$|E
50|$|A {{community}} {{bulletin board}} (CBB) is a digital signage system that public, educational, and government access cable television providers {{use as a}} <b>Barker</b> <b>channel</b> to keep communities up to date of events listings, weather and other news that can be delivered by using digital on-screen graphic s. The electronic bulletin board concept {{is a form of}} Technological convergence.|$|E
50|$|In July 2014, Videotron {{indicated}} to the CRTC that it intended to change Canal Indigo into a bilingual (English / French) service, {{due to the}} planned shutdown of English-language provider Viewers Choice {{at the end of}} September 2014. Due to new standard conditions of licence for PPV providers being introduced in 2014, CRTC approval is no longer required to convert from a single-language service to a bilingual one. However, since Videotron operates almost exclusively in French-language markets, the company requested an exemption from the standard requirement for bilingual PPV services which would otherwise require it to operate a minimum of 15 English-language channels and 5 French-language channels, plus a separate <b>barker</b> <b>channel</b> in each language. Under Videotron's original proposal, Canal Indigo would offer at least 8 French-language channels and 2 English-language channels, plus a bilingual <b>barker</b> <b>channel.</b> The application was approved on September 30, on condition that Canal Indigo maintain the same ratio but with a minimum of 3 English-language channels (and thus 12 French-language channels).|$|E
30|$|Saraca asoca is {{a medium}} sized, {{evergreen}} tree grows to {{a height of}} 7 – 10  m, which occurs up to an altitude of 750  m MSL. Leaves are 15 – 20  cm long, rachis glabrous, corky at the base; petioles very short; stipules intrapetiolar, completely united, 4 – 6 pairs of leaflets which are oblong- lanceolate, obtuse or acute, quite glabrous, base rounded or cuneate. The bark is rough and uneven, dark brown or grey or almost black with warty surface. <b>Bark</b> <b>channeled,</b> smooth with circular lenticels and traversely ridged, sometimes cracked (Ali 2008; Rastogi 2003).|$|R
50|$|The station {{signed on}} the air on May 14, 2000. Despite {{transmitting}} its signal on UHF channel 21, KNBN identifies as NewsCenter1 on-air, an artifact of when the main cable systems in the market carried the station on Channel 1, which today is usually used solely to provide a slot for video on demand services, <b>barker</b> <b>channels</b> or electronic program guide services. Currently, KNBN is carried on local cable systems on channel 10, though it retains the NewsCenter1 branding. Before KNBN signed on, NBC was provided via cable from KUSA in Denver- before that, KEVN served as the primary NBC station in the area.|$|R
50|$|As of 2017, many cable {{providers}} {{have switched}} to digital-only systems which require mandatory use of either their approved set top boxes or an approved CableCARD device. In many cases, no analog channels are available, {{and if they}} are, are usually just the provider's paid programming, Emergency Alert System and <b>barker</b> <b>channels,</b> or merely a one-channel signal which lets a customer or installer know the signal is viewable on a television set. Channels and programming may also be available through digital media player devices such as the Roku or Apple TV (along with tablets and smartphones) via provider apps, which confirm subscriber eligibility through a private internal IP network and require an on-network connection to the provider, making any piracy through that venue virtually impossible.|$|R
50|$|A <b>barker</b> <b>channel</b> {{is a form}} {{of digital}} signage, {{operating}} {{in the form of a}} television channel that is entirely composed of sales promotion and advertising, usually marketing various features of the service carrying the channel. The name is derived from the circus barker, who stood outside a circus and shouted to passers-by to encourage them to enter to view the entertainment being provided by the attraction.|$|E
50|$|E! was {{originally}} launched on July 31, 1987 as Movietime, {{a service that}} aired movie trailers, entertainment news, event and awards coverage, and interviews as an early example of a national <b>barker</b> <b>channel.</b> The channel was founded by Larry Namer and Alan Mruvka. Early Movietime hosts included Greg Kinnear, Paula Abdul, Katie Wagner, Julie Moran, Suzanne Kay (daughter of Diahann Carroll), Mark DeCarlo, Sam Rubin and Richard Blade.|$|E
50|$|Top Up TV Promo was {{a digital}} {{television}} <b>Barker</b> <b>channel</b> broadcast in the United Kingdom to promote services offered by Top Up TV. The channel launched on 18 September 2006, and closed on 6 October 2013. The channel broadcast a looped promotional video, presented by Craig Doyle, advertising Top Up TV's new Anytime service. The channel broadcast free to air on {{digital terrestrial television}} between 6:00 am and noon each day.|$|E
50|$|Juglans californica can {{be either}} a large shrub with 1-5 trunks, or a small, single-trunked tree. The main trunk can fork close to the ground, making it look like two trees that have grown together, then diverged. It has thick <b>bark,</b> deeply <b>channeled</b> or furrowed at maturity. It has large, pinnately {{compound}} leaves with 11-19 lanceolate leaflets with toothed margins and no hair in the vein angles. It has a small hard nut in a shallowly grooved, thick shell {{that is difficult to}} remove.|$|R
40|$|Tree {{architectural}} model {{is basically a}} tree construction {{as a result of}} meristematic growth pattern. Tree architectureis closely associated with water and soil components, i. e. rainfall, throughfall, stem flow, infiltration, surface run-off,and erosion. For Altingia excelsa (Rasamala) plots, the results showed that the daily average of the rainfall intensityobserved was 9. 67 mm, stem flow 0. 03 mm, canopy throughfall 5. 43 mm, infiltration 0. 51 ml/mm 2 /second,surface run-off 3. 45 mm, and erosion 5. 66 kg/m 2. For Schima wallichii (Puspa), the daily average of rainfall was 9. 67 mm, stem flow 0. 04 mm, canopy throughfall 4. 02 mm, infiltration 0. 49 ml/mm 2 /second, surface run-off 8. 18 mm, and erosion 12. 71 kg/m 2. Compared to A. excelsa, S. wallichii significantly had larger values in someparameters measured, i. e. stem flow, surface run-off, and erosion, indicating that on land sopes of 70 % of theMount Gede Pangrango National Park, individual plants of S. wallichii seemed to be well adapted. However,individuals of A. excelsa possessed a more spreadly branching model, larger vertical width, denser canopy, andskewed <b>bark</b> <b>channels</b> capable for slowing down the stem flow and canopy throughfall. Consequently plants of A. excelsa would generally be able to hold and conserve water and soil better than S. wallichii plants...|$|R

50|$|The {{monaural}} audio {{used for}} SuperTV's film broadcasts was transmitted on a subcarrier, which {{would later be}} used to transmit the difference signal of multichannel television sound after 1984. Until the first MTS sets became available in 1985, most conventional television sets could not decode the audio; however shortly afterward, the <b>barker</b> <b>channel</b> would be transmitted on the right audio channel and the monoural program audio feed would transmit on the left.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} a <b>barker</b> <b>channel</b> is the NBA League Pass Preview Channel, {{which is used to}} {{advertise}} and promote the NBA League Pass out-of-market sports package available to digital cable and satellite systems. In a technical form, specialty channels focused on a single sport such as NBA TV, NFL Network, NHL Network and MLB Network could be considered barkers, which may push devoted viewers into ordering those leagues' respective pay-per-view packages to watch complete game broadcasts.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, Prevue Networks {{launched}} Sneak Prevue, a spin-off <b>barker</b> <b>channel</b> {{that was}} exclusively {{used to promote}} programming on a provider's pay-per-view services; it displayed full-screen promos (augmented by graphics displaying scheduling and ordering information) and a schedule of upcoming films and events airing on each pay-per-view channel based on either airtime or genre. The channel was also driven by Amiga 2000 hardware, and its software was as crash-prone as the Prevue Guide software itself. TV Guide Network ceased operations of Sneak Prevue in 2002.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to his work on The Fast Show, in 1997 Thomas made a BBC Two pilot with Ulrika Jonsson called It's Ulrika written by Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer. In 1998 he starred in Shooting Stars and The Fast Show Live at the Hammersmith Apollo, the sketch show <b>Barking</b> for <b>Channel</b> 4 alongside Mackenzie Crook, Catherine Tate, Peter Kay and David Walliams and appeared at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival with Stay Alive Pepi. He also appeared in Sir Bernard Chumley's Stately Homes and the pilot show Crazy Jonathan's with Matt Lucas and David Walliams. In 1999 he workedas a team writer on series one of the The 11 O'Clock Show and was a radio presenter on the XFM breakfast show with Natasha Desborough.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The present {{work was}} carried out to perform the morphoanatomical and {{physicochemical}} evaluation of Casuarina equisetifolia L. stem bark. Method: The pharmacognostic {{studies were carried out}} in terms of organoleptic, macroscopic, microscopic, fluorescence analysis and physicochemical parameters. Results: The <b>bark</b> consists of <b>channelled,</b> curved, slightly quilled, usually 0. 2 – 0. 8  cm thick, lenticellate pieces with outer surface ash-grey to greyish-brown and internal surface light yellow to deep dirty brown coloured having no odour and astringent taste. The main microscopic characteristics of the bark include phellem (2 – 5 or more layers of cork), phellogen (3 – 5 layered) followed by 12 – 18 layered phelloderm. Other important microscopic components observed include phloem parenchyma, phloem fibre and stone cells. Stem bark powder showed thick walled oval to polygonal cork cells, hexagonal phelloderm cells, rectangular thin walled cortex cells, thick walled elongated phloem fibres, lignified stone cells and rhomboidal crystals of calcium oxalate. Further, physicochemical analysis of the bark power showed loss on drying, total ash, water soluble ash, acid insoluble ash and sulphated ash as 2. 3, 5. 0, 1. 6, 0. 7 and 5. 7 % w/w respectively. The alcohol and water soluble extractives values of the stem bark were 17. 10 and 11. 0 % w/w respectively. Conclusion: Various pharmacognostic characters observed in this study helps in botanical identification and standardization of C. equisetifolia L. in crude form...|$|R
50|$|In 1831, on the {{recommendation}} of Charles Sturt, who had discovered the shoaled mouth of the Murray River the previous year, Barker was sent to explore the east coast of Gulf St Vincent in South Australia to see if another channel from the Murray entered the sea there.On 13 April 1831, Barker and his party arrived at Cape Jervis on the Isabella. He examined the coast and found that there was no <b>channel.</b> <b>Barker</b> discovered the Onkaparinga River on 15 April. He then explored the ranges inland, north of the present site of Adelaide, and climbed Mount Lofty where he sighted the Port River inlet, Barker Inlet and the future Port Adelaide, his most important discovery. He then moored Isabella near present Yankalilla Bay and went overland to explore the area around Lake Alexandrina and Encounter Bay. On 29 April the mouth of the Murray was reached. Barker swam across the narrow channel the next morning, went over a sandhill, and was never seen again. A few days later the party learned that Barker had been killed by the local Indigenous people who may have taken him for a whaler or sealer, many of whom had abducted Indigenous women. The men responsible had been identified but no retaliation or punitive action against those believed responsible was undertaken, which one commentator believed emboldened those people to commit further attacks on Europeans, notably the Maria survivors.|$|R
50|$|The Viewers Choice {{channels}} {{left the}} air between 10:00pm and 12:00 midnight EDT {{on the evening of}} September 30, 2014. The final programs scheduled for the various channels included replays of the previous weekend's UFC 178 event; movies including Winter's Tale, 300: Rise of an Empire, The Quiet Ones, The Grand Seduction, and The Other Woman; and various adult programs. The service's <b>barker</b> <b>channel</b> continued to air previews right up until midnight EDT, at which point it began to air a loop of an animated Viewers Choice bumper until eventually shutting down entirely.|$|E
50|$|PBS America {{launched}} on 1 November 2011 (as PBS UK) via satellite on Sky and via cable on Virgin Media. On 23 August 2011, PBS UK launched a placeholder channel called Rosa on Sky channel 231, however {{they were able}} to acquire the more prominent channel 166 EPG slot from Information TV for use from launch. On 28 October 2011, a <b>barker</b> <b>channel</b> for PBS UK was added to Virgin Media channel 243. The cable operator has also secured the rights to offer PBS content on its video on demand service, including the Virgin Media Player.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, the new {{management}} planned another revamp for the network, {{with plans to}} rename the channel as Screen TV. However these plans were eventually scrapped, and the channel quietly ceased operations in April 2002 as its content was merged within the scrolling listings grid of parent network TV Guide Channel, including pricing and ordering information. This was most likely {{due to the fact}} that dominant pay-per-view provider In Demand provided its own <b>barker</b> <b>channel,</b> and as a result of other cable systems deciding to advertise their film lineups on their own. The ending also coincided with the discontinuation of Laserdisc production by Imation.|$|E
50|$|Virgin Central was a <b>barker</b> <b>channel</b> from Virgin Media Television, {{promoting}} video-on-demand content. The {{service was}} launched on the Virgin Media cable television platform on 20 February 2007. Viewers {{were presented with}} a video loop promoting the programmes available. They would then press the red button on the remote control and would be presented {{with a list of}} television series, episodes of which they could have watched at any time they like during the week. The programmes were all free to watch, and did not have any adverts in them. The viewer could also have use their remote control to pause, fast forward, rewind and stop the programme at any time.|$|E
50|$|On October 1, 2014, {{following}} the shutdown of Viewers Choice, {{most of that}} service's channels were replaced on Rogers Cable by new Sportsnet PPV channels carrying similar programming; however, at least on Rogers, the new channels solely feature live special events and adult programming. Several channels which aired general-interest movies were not replaced, though such content is now generally available through video on demand services operated directly by most service providers. In fact, the service's <b>barker</b> <b>channel</b> prominently promotes movies available on demand through Rogers and most other carrying providers, although neither Rogers nor any other service provider is explicitly named on that channel.|$|E
50|$|The {{network was}} {{originally}} conceived in 1981 as a <b>barker</b> <b>channel</b> service providing {{a display of}} localized channel and program listings for cable television providers. Later on, the service, now branded as Prevue, began to broadcast interstitial segments alongside the on-screen guide, which included entertainment news and promotions for upcoming programs. After Prevue's parent company, United Video Satellite Group, acquired the entertainment magazine TV Guide in 1998 (UVSG would in turn, be acquired by Gemstar the following year), the service was relaunched as TV Guide Channel (later TV Guide Network), which now featured full-length programs dealing with the entertainment industry, including news magazines and reality shows, along with red carpet coverage from major award shows.|$|E
5000|$|The network {{launched}} on 31 July 1987 as Movietime, {{a service that}} aired movie trailers, entertainment news, event and awards coverage, and interviews as an early example of a national <b>barker</b> <b>channel.</b> Three years later, in June 1990, Movietime was renamed E! Entertainment Television to emphasise its widening coverage of the celebrity-industrial complex, contemporary film, television and music, daily Hollywood gossip, and fashion.In the Fall of 1999, Zone Vision launched E! Entertainment in Poland, under a licensing agreement on the Polish digital platform Wizja TV, with Zone's Studio Company providing localized content. [...] The channel was shut down by 2002.In 2002 E! launched in Europe with its headquarters situated in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. One of the first countries E! broadcast in was Germany, where it telecast daily.|$|E
50|$|The {{predecessor}} to TW3, Time Warner 9, {{was on the}} {{air from}} 1997 (when Time Warner purchased the CVI and Cablevision systems in the market) until 2002. Originally, the channel was primarily a <b>barker</b> <b>channel</b> for the then-new services of digital cable and Road Runner plus a clearinghouse for overflow sports programming, most notably WWOR-produced New York Mets games. After Time Warner purchased the former TCI systems in Schenectady and Amsterdam in 1999, it evolved into a showcase for Time Warner's own programming {{as well as a}} home for local sports programming. Time Warner 9 was also the home for New York Yankees games in 1999 and from 2000 until 2002 aired a replay of WRGB's 6:00 p.m. newscast at 6:30 p.m., the success of which was a catalyst for the establishment of its replacement, Capital News 9.|$|E
50|$|SelecTV was {{transmitted}} via scrambled signal {{from a local}} UHF television station. A decoder box was required to unscramble the signal in order to view its programming. SelecTV was available {{in at least three}} markets: in Milwaukee on WCGV (channel 24, now a MyNetworkTV affiliate), in Los Angeles on KWHY-TV (channel 22, now a MundoMax affiliate), and in Philadelphia on WWSG (channel 57, now CW owned-and-operated station WPSG). On WWSG, the service utilized the gated-pulse scrambling technique for the video - and for the audio using technology that would later be used to enable multichannel television sound, moving the audio to a different subcarrier, freeing the standard audio channel for use as a <b>barker</b> <b>channel</b> (which was used for sales promotions). In 1984, New Jersey-based Wometco Home Theater began offering SelecTV on its affiliated television stations after the network ceased programming; however, the affiliation with SelecTV would not last long, as within a year, WHT ceased operations. This occurred following a massive financial collapse, its own {{as a result of a}} majority of their subscribers defecting to cable television services which offered more channels, including pay television services such as HBO and Showtime.|$|E
