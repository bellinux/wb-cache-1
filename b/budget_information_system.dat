40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{development}} of methods and tools to design hybrid distributed data warehouses. The analysis of the existing research aimed at solving this problem has shown the lack of the combined logical and physical data distribution in the data warehouse, based on both the data characteristics and query statistics. The thesis proposes the introduction of the concept of multibase data warehouses, as well as their models and inter-level transitions. Logical data distribution is performed based on the data structuredness with the purpose to choose models to represent the source data. Physical data distribution combines placement of data among the nodes and routing data replication, both operations are provided based on the minimal cost criterion. Multibase data warehouse concept is introduced. Multibase data warehouses consist of three levels: the data level, nodes level and data stores level. The data may be stored in the data stores, which are subject to data storage optimization, and the data sources that store the data loaded in the data stores and provide an extra level of data redundancy to protect the data warehouse from data retrieval failures. The nodes are classified into the central nodes that hold geo-independent data, and regional ones that store geo-dependent data. The data stores in nodes are classified into the primary and secondary ones, with the primary stores used for read and write access, and the secondary ones ? for read only access. Based on the the concept of multibase data warehouses, the process of their building envisions application of hybrid distributed data warehousing an adaptive technology. It starts with the source analysis and then continues with the conceptual, logical and physical design phases. Conceptual design phase is done based on E/R model with the additional ?split entity? and ?merge entity? operations to support partly-structured data. To categorize the data into areas, relational model has been extended with ?the linked set building? operation. Logical design phase determines the logical model, which describes the entity-to-data-store-element and the link-to-data-store-relation correspondence. To decide which model of data store will be chosen, the structuredness is analyzed, so the data is classified into the structured, semi-structured and partly-structured data. The models to store data are chosen based on the structuredness class and minimal cost criteria. To load the data properly, the procedures of converting data from the models of sources to the model of warehouse and vice versa are described. Physical design phase envisions distribution of data between the nodes and routes data replication based on the minimal cost criteria as well. Minimal cost criteria used in this paper ensures accounting for the data placement, processing and replication cost. The data placement and replication configuration, which provides minimal cost are found using the modified genetic algorithm. This algorithm uses block-based crossover and mutation with ad hoc adjusted probabilities, as well as the preliminary stage of forming initial population based on the artificial bee colony (ABC) method, which provides for approaching the sought solution and reducing the overall time needed to find it. The Information technology for building distributed hybrid data warehouses which utilizes the proposed models and methods was developed. To implement this technology in public finance of Ukraine, the generic system of public finance management is proposed. It has the levels of data storage, processing and delivery. The multibase data warehouse and its data access services are used for the data storage. The data can be accessed using standard SQL notation, regardless of the node, where the data have been stored and the model represented, and the distributed data services provide for the data usage with the acceptable connection latency regardless of user location that helps to maintain query processing time within the preset limit. Processing of data is done by applications that use the data in the warehouse. Different applications may use the same or different data depending on the business processes and the data warehouse will adapt to the resulting data usage. The data are delivered through both the Web services and sites, as well as non-Web thin clients and thick clients due to the diversity of existing applications and new developments. The examples of Public Finance Management System, ?Transparent <b>Budget?</b> <b>information</b> <b>system,</b> as well as several e-learning and scientific resources demonstrate efficiency of the information technology due to the increase of query performance and decrease of total cost of storing and processing data in the warehouse. The software used for implementation of this information technology is Multibase Data Warehouse Management System (MDWMS), which consists of querying agents, database management agents, data placement and data warehouse description modules, MDWMS Configurator and Client applications. These modules have been designed to manage databases based on the proposed method and to support the environment for the user and applications access. User applications connect to the data through the software interface (MDWMS API) and the end users use MDW Client for direct data access. Having provided such access, user applications can use the data, regardless of their location and the actual data model, where they have been stored. The statistics is checked on a regular basis to find out whether the requirements to the data warehouse performance and reliability are met. If these requirements are not met, the repeated data warehouse building is performed based on the current data in the warehouse and data sources, query statistics, so that after such building has been completed, the set requirements will be met. ? ??????????????? ?????? ?????? ?????????? ??????-???????????? ?????? ?????????? ?????????????? ???????? ?????? ?????????? ???? ? ?????? ??????? ?????? ? ?????????? ?????????? ???????? ? ?????????. ??????????? ?????? ?????? ?????????? ?????????????? ???????? ?????? ?????????? ????, ?????????? ???????????? ??????? ???? ??????. ?????????? ?????????? ? ?????????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????????? ???????? ?????? ?????????? ????. ??????? ??????? ????????????? ???????? ??????, ??????????? ??????????????, ?????????? ? ?????????? ?????? ????? ???????? ? ???????? ???????????? ?????????. ??????? ?????????? ?????? ? ????????? ? ??????? ???????? ??????????? ?????? ? ????????, ? ????? ?????? ??????? ??? ????????????? ??????. ?????????? ?????? ????? ?????? ????????? ? ???????? ?????????? ?????? ???????????? ??? ?????? ???????? ????????? ? ????????????????? ????????????? ?????????. ?? ????????? ???????????? ??????? ? ??????? ??????????? ?????????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????????? ???????? ?????? ?????????? ????, ??????? ?????? ???????????? ??????? ??????. ????????? ?????????? ????????? ??? ?????????? ?????????????? ? ?????????????-????????????? ?????? ??? ???????????? ???????? ???????. ?????????? ????????? ???????????, ??? ??? ???????? ???????? ???????????...|$|E

30|$|At the {{beginning}} of the period, the principal designs the budgeting process. The principal has two options for the design of the budgeting process. She can either implement a top-down (TB) or a participative (PB) budgeting process. With a participative budgeting process in place, the agents obtain private information and the principal asks the agents to report on their private information. She cannot observe whether the reports are truthful or not. The report of agent i on his private information is denoted by r_i and can either be η _L or η _H. When the principal implements a top-down budgeting process, the agents neither obtain private information nor are asked to send a report. This means, whereas, in the participative budgeting process, the principal implements an <b>information</b> <b>system</b> that privately informs the agents about their divisions’ market fit, no <b>information</b> <b>system</b> is installed in the top-down <b>budgeting</b> process.

But differences with security standards, security guideline could be organisation specified, i. e. certain type of organisations could only concern certain security requirements. And also security guideline could be updated much quicker than security standards to deal cutting-edges security issues quicker. Security guideline should meet some common security requirements. For most of <b>information</b> <b>systems,</b> there are common security issues. The security guideline produced in the final is going to mention with some common facts for any <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> School of Computing, Communications and Electronic...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The US Department of Energy has {{a goal to}} make ethanol from biomass cost {{competitive}} with petroleum by 2012. Feedstock procurement is expected to represent {{a significant portion of}} the operating costs for a refinery that produces ethanol from biomass such as switchgrass. Thus, cost-effective feedstock logistics will be a key factor for the future development of a capital intensive cellulosic ethanol industry. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the cost of various logistic methods of switchgrass production, harvesting, storing, and transportation. Design/methodology/approach – This study applied enterprise <b>budgeting</b> and geographical <b>information</b> <b>system</b> (GIS) software to analyze the costs of three logistic methods of acquiring switchgrass feedstock for a 25 million gallon per year refinery. Procurement methods included traditional large round and rectangular bale harvest and storage systems and satellite preprocessing facilities using field-chopped material. The analysis evaluated tradeoffs in operating costs, dry matter losses during storage, and investment requirements among the three systems. Findings – Results suggest that the preprocessing system outperformed the conventional bale harvest methods in the delivered costs of switchgrass. Practical implications – The cost savings in harvest, transportation, and dry matter losses for the preprocessing system offset their extensive capital costs and generated cost advantages over the conventional methods. Social implications – The traditional round bale system has a higher overall investment cost, may not be the most cost-effective way to procure switchgrass feedstock for a refinery, and may limit farmer participation in the feedstock value chain. Originality/value – GIS methods combined with enterprise budgeting can be useful tools for evaluating investment in feedstock supply chain infrastructure.

40|$|This {{workshop}} {{looks at}} how accounting packages such as MYOB {{can act as}} an accounting <b>information</b> <b>system</b> (AIS). The workshop will briefly overview what an accounting <b>information</b> <b>system</b> is; particularly identifying the requirement of the system to produce business intelligence and value added information or processes. The aim is then to explore (hands-on) the various MYOB command centres to identify where business intelligence exists and where the program value adds for business. It is suggested that such an activity is ideally what students {{will be able to}} explore and do. The business intelligence and value added concepts will include reflection on the large amount of information available from the MYOB system; this includes a wide range of reports, customer database communication, marketing and <b>budgeting</b> <b>information</b> and automation features. Participants are encouraged to bring along laptops with the MYOB software loaded. This AIS approach differs from the current teaching focus taken in the 501 Accounting Practices paper, which tends to concentrate on transactional processing and the preparation of financial statements. The author is suggesting a refocus or rejuvenation of the prescription to incorporate an AIS approach. This will help meet the growing needs of business for business intelligence collected from the accounting system...|$|R
