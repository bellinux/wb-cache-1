5000|$|In 1977, Wood {{indicated}} {{that there were two}} types of <b>bio-metric</b> authentication approaches - physiological and behavioral bio-metrics.

The utilization of the bio-metrics for user authentication had been developed in the field such as: location-based access control, notably keystroke dynamics and typing pattern. In 2010, Shi et al. had migrated bio-metrics authentication approach to mobile device which contained many sensors, and significantly increased the accuracy of the authentication, and they called the new approach [...] "implicit authentication". Due to the fast growth of smart technology, smart device became more and more sophisticated with computational power grew in each year, and it provided the foundation for IA to achieve high accurate and user-friendly authentication. The current IA approaches mainly focused on touch sensor, GPS and accelerometer, and the corresponding techniques were SVM, kNN, GMM and topic model.|$|E

40|$|Context: The {{invention}} of mobile phones makes the human life easier. The {{purpose of this}} study is to identify security risks in mobile banking and to provide an authentication method for mobile banking transaction by using <b>bio-metric</b> mechanism. Objectives: Current mobile banking authentication is challenging and identified as a major security risk. Literature review shows that customer distrusts mobile banking due to security issues. The authors discuss security risks in current authentication methods in mobile banking. Methods: There are different methods and approaches to handle authentication in mobile banking. In this thesis, we propose a new approach of authentication in mobile banking. The strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches of authentication are identified with the help of Literature Review and interviews. The authors present basic transaction model and include security risks. By Literature Review it is found that finger print mechanism is a suitable method for authentication. Authors focus on authentication method and present a biometric scanning device which can identify the customer’s finger print thus enabling the customer to access mobile banking facility. Results: An authentication model is proposed through design process. The proposed biometric design was validated by conducting a workshop. The analysis of the workshop’s results showed that customer’s trust in security for mobile banking will be increased by finger print mechanism. To promote mobile banking, it is necessary to improve customer trust in terms of security. Conclusions: The authors concluded that, only authorized person will be able to use mobile banking services by incorporating <b>bio-metric</b> finger-print mechanism. By literature review and interview it was found that finger-print mechanism is more suitable than other ordinary mechanisms like login and password mechanism, SMS etc. Using mobile phones for mobile banking, customers can push or pull the details like Funds transfer, Bill payment, Share trade, Check order and also inquiries like Account balance, Account statement and Check status Transaction history etc. It means that the customer is interacting with the files, databases etc., of the bank. Database at the server end is sensitive in terms of security. Customers distrust mobile devices to transfer money or for making any transactions. The reason is that security is a major concern for the customer’s fulfillment. Customer’s main concern in using mobile devices for mobile banking is the authentication method used to ensure that the right person is accessing the services like transaction etc. The authors made a basic model for mobile banking transaction. All security risks were included in the transaction model. Then the authors focused on authentication method. By literature review and interview it was concluded that security can be improved by bio metric methods. The authors focused on different <b>bio-metric</b> mechanism and concluded that fingerprint mechanism is more suitable as it requires less storage capacity in database and identifies the uniqueness of customers. The authors suggest a possible solution by proposing finger-print mechanism model and designed a <b>bio-metric</b> scanning device as a solution through which customer can interact with banking system using their finger-print. The result of workshop shows that <b>bio-metric</b> finger print mechanism is more suitable and secure then other authentication methods for mobile banking. 00453184779...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Cryptography is {{a concept}} to protect data during {{transmission}} over wireless network. Cryptography is used in information security to protect information from unauthorized or accidental disclosure while the information is in transmitting (either electrically or physically) and while information is in storage. The information could be accessed by the unauthorized user for malicious purpose. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} apply effective encryption/decryption methods to enhance data security. The existing system limits only the total number of users from the unknown remote host to as low as the known remote host. It uses the white list values for tracking legitimate users. But the cookie value expires after certain time period. So the attackers may use different browsers or may try on another machine or may retry after certain time. If any malicious attacks occurred the authenticated user does not know about that. The proposed system uses two algorithms known us <b>Bio-Metric</b> Encryption Algorithm (BEA), Minutiae Extraction Algorithm (MEA). It uses Multi <b>Bio-metric</b> features for authentication purpose. And also this system dynamically generates a new Session Key for each transaction. So the proposed system will protect Dat...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Currently <b>Bio-metric</b> {{authentication}} {{systems are}} widely used, {{in order to}} provide authentication without processing any physical material. Some important aspects of biometric authentication systems are security, privacy and accuracy. Fingerprint, face, voice, palm and iris are biometric features used in <b>bio-metric</b> authentication systems. In this paper, we tend to propose a demonstrably, more secured method of identity verification system, that addresses the user’s privacy, network security, and accuracy. Iris authentication technique is proposed for protecting identity of user in e-commerce transactions. Iris authentication technique is planned for safeguarding identity of user in e-commerce transactions. To boost the protection, three layered system architecture is designed in which two layers for data security and single layer for accuracy are provided. Protocol is not revealing the plain biometric details when traveling through the network. Encrypted data template is prepared by using Augmented key generation algorithm along with RSA. This feature provides network security. While transmission system uses Augmented key generation RSA algorithm which is having more encryption strength & optimized key generation time as compared to RSA. This will provide more data security and efficient key generation technique in our system. Using 3 DES, system will offer more security and legitimacy...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays <b>bio-metric</b> {{authentication}} {{systems are}} widely used {{in order to provide}} authentication without possessing any physical materials. <b>Bio-metric</b> authentication systems are mainly concentrating on security, revocability, privacy, and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a provably two way secured biometric authentication system, which addresses the concerns of user’s privacy, template protection, trust issues, network security, and accuracy. The system is highly secure in the sense, biometric details are going to be encrypted twice, the system won’t reveal any additional information about the user or biometric, to the authenticating server’s database or to the insecure network. In this system two different encryption algorithms have been used both in the client and server side. One is public key cryptography another one is private key cryptography. User’s privacy as concern it is revealing only the identity of the user. In template protection this protocol will store the template as encrypted form. Protocol will provide trust between remote user and server, while a remote user cannot be reliably identified without biometric information. Since network security as concern protocol is not revealing the plain biometric details while it is passed through the network. The proposed approach has no restrictions on the biometric data used and it is applicable for multiple biometrics(face, iris, hand geometry, and finger print). Authentication by using two way encryption will give additional layer of security when comparing with existing system.
