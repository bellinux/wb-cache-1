25|$|Alexander Livingstone Bruce was {{reported}} as living permanently in Edinburgh in 1940, having left Nyasaland and retired, although the date he left is uncertain.

A government survey of the estate showed {{that it had been}} badly managed and deforested, and its soil had lost fertility. Nevertheless, the Governor felt it was necessary to buy the land. Bruce wanted a figure that would wipe-out its accumulated losses since 1925, but the Governor considered this was excessive, and ended negotiations. In 1947 the company provisionally agreed to sell Magomero to a private buyer at a price of £80,000. However, this sale fell through, leaving Bruce feeling outraged.|$|E
25|$|Roberts was a {{real estate}} {{salesperson}} in 1964 when Abe Hirschfeld hired her {{to sit in the}} lobby and sell at 925 Park Avenue in New York. She was a condominium <b>broker</b> <b>in</b> 1968 when she met and began her involvement with the then-married multi-millionaire real estate entrepreneur Harry Helmsley. In 1970, she joined one of Helmsley's brokerage firms—Brown, Harris, Stevens—as a senior vice-president. At that time, she was already a millionaire in her own right. Helmsley divorced his wife of 33 years and married Roberts on April 8, 1972. Roberts's marriage to Helmsley may well have saved her career. Late in 1971, several of her tenants sued her for forcing the tenants of one of the apartments she managed to buy condominiums. They won, and she was forced not only to compensate the tenants but to give them three-year leases. Her real estate license was also suspended, so she focused on running Helmsley's growing hotel empire.|$|E

25|$|The largest {{producers}} of cotton, currently (2009), are China and India, with annual production of about 34 million bales and 33.4 million bales, respectively; {{most of this}} production is consumed by their respective textile industries. The largest exporters of raw cotton are the United States, with sales of $4.9 billion, and Africa, with sales of $2.1 billion. The total international trade {{is estimated to be}} $12 billion. Africa's share of the cotton trade has doubled since 1980. Neither area has a significant domestic textile industry, textile manufacturing having moved to developing nations in Eastern and South Asia such as India and China. In Africa, cotton is grown by numerous small holders. Dunavant Enterprises, based in Memphis, Tennessee, is the leading cotton <b>broker</b> <b>in</b> Africa, with hundreds of purchasing agents. It operates cotton gins in Uganda, Mozambique, and Zambia. In Zambia, it often offers loans for seed and expenses to the 180,000 small farmers who grow cotton for it, as well as advice on farming methods. Cargill also purchases cotton in Africa for export.|$|E
25|$|The Stock Market Crash of 1929 {{wiped the}} Wilders out; their daughter's {{investments}} were devastated as well. They still owned the 200 acre (81 hectare) farm, {{but they had}} invested most of their savings with their daughter Rose Wilder Lane's <b>broker.</b> <b>In</b> 1930, Wilder requested Lane's opinion about an autobiographical manuscript Wilder had written about her pioneering childhood. The Great Depression, coupled with the deaths of Wilder's mother in 1924 and her older sister in 1928, seem to have prompted her to preserve her memories in a life story called Pioneer Girl. Wilder also hoped that her writing would generate some additional income. The original title {{of the first of}} the books was When Grandma Was a Little Girl. On the advice of Lane's publisher, Wilder greatly expanded the story. As a result of Lane's publishing connections as a successful writer and after editing by Lane, Harper & Brothers published Wilder's book in 1932 as Little House in the Big Woods. After its success, Wilder continued writing. The close and often rocky collaboration between her and Lane continued, in person until 1935 when Lane permanently left Rocky Ridge Farm, and afterward by correspondence.|$|E
25|$|Another weak phase {{followed}} Tudhaliya I, and the Hittites' enemies {{from all}} directions were able to advance even to Hattusa and raze it. However, the Kingdom recovered its former glory under Suppiluliuma I (c. 1350 BC), who again conquered Aleppo, Mitanni was reduced to vassalage by the Assyrians under his son-in-law, and he defeated Carchemish, another Amorite city-state. With his own sons placed over all of these new conquests, Babylonia still {{in the hands of}} the allied Kassites, this left Suppiluliuma the supreme power <b>broker</b> <b>in</b> the known world, alongside Assyria and Egypt, and it was not long before Egypt was seeking an alliance by marriage of another of his sons with the widow of Tutankhamen. Unfortunately, that son was evidently murdered before reaching his destination, and this alliance was never consummated. However, the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365-1050 BC) once more began to grow in power also, with the ascension of Ashur-uballit I in 1365 BC. Ashur-uballit I attacked and defeated Mattiwaza the Mitanni king despite attempts by the Hittite king Suppiluliumas I, now fearful of growing Assyrian power, attempting to preserve his throne with military support. The lands of the Mitanni and Hurrians were duly appropriated by Assyria, enabling it to encroach on Hittite territory in eastern Asia Minor, and Adad-nirari I annexed Carchemish and north east Syria from the control of the Hittites.|$|E
