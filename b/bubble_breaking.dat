40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} experimentally the bubble breakup in a microfluidic T-junction divergence using a high-speed digital camera and a micro-Particle Image Velocimetry (micro-PIV) system. The breakup and non-breakup of N- 2 bubbles in glycerol-water mixtures with several concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) as surfactant were studied with capillary number ranging from 0. 001 to 0. 1. The cross section of PMMA square microchannel is 400 mu m wide and 400 mu m deep. Four various flow patterns were observed at the T-junction by changing gas and liquid flow rates. The dynamics of three various types of symmetric breakup of bubbles were investigated. The symmetric breakup of bubbles type I is mainly controlled by the augmented pressure in liquid phase. The symmetric breakup of bubbles type II is controlled by both the increased pressure and viscous forces. In the symmetric breakup of bubbles type III, a scaling law for the minimum bubble neck and the remaining time during <b>bubble</b> <b>breaking</b> process were found. The transitions between breakup and non-breakup of bubbles were investigated, and a power-law relationship between bubble extension and capillary number was proposed to predict the transitions between adjacent regimes. Our experimental results reveal that the bubble breakup in a microfluidic T-junction divergence {{is similar to the}} droplet behaviours in such a device (Jullien et al., 2009; Leshansky and Pismen, 2009; Link et al., 2004) ...|$|E
40|$|Polymeric foams are {{ubiquitous}} in foods and industrial manufacturing. Since, {{they are used}} {{in a number of}} applications as thermal and acoustic insulators, in some cases it is desirable to create foams with cells not interconnected (i. e. closed cells), while in others cases an efficient interconnections between cells (i. e. opened cells) is required, as instance for culture substrates for living cells. In both cases, a fundamental understanding of the physics governing the cell opening process is needed to improve the final product and reduce the polymeric manufacturing cost. In this dissertation, the physical mechanisms leading to cell opening in foams is investigated from a fundamental point of view. As such, the complex foaming process (i. e. involving different physical mechanisms) was studied with a bottom-up process, dividing it in four elementary steps namely: 1) cells growth, 2) cells interaction, 3) rupture and 4) retraction of the cells walls. Different experimental techniques are employed in this thesis; most of them were designed during the Ph. D. to reproduce particular experimental conditions, which are difficult to be obtained with typical foaming equipment. In fact, different new experimental apparatus were developed (i. e. Mini-batch, Interfacial <b>bubble,</b> <b>Breaking</b> bubble) and specifically designed to make unique measurements. The new apparata are particularly useful for testing theoretical predictions on some types of simplified systems useful {{for the study of the}} foaming process. The main and novel result of this thesis is the fundamentals understanding of the entire foaming process that leads to a fundamental comprehension of how to produce a particular foam morphology, called fully opened cell. In the literature, there was not fundamentals understanding of the mechanisms behind the cell opening in thermoplastic foaming, since the reported foaming models stop the modeling at the rupture event in the cell walls, without considering the retraction event of the produced hole. The introduction of the retraction as the fundamental step to produce a fully open cell morphology is the novelty of this thesis. Moreover, the comprehension of the retraction step, leads to us to identify the importance of the role of the viscoelasticity for making a fully opened cell foam, that is a new concept that is unique and it was not covered earlier in the previous literature. Moreover, a model of the entire foaming process was developed and it was identified a criterion that employs the computed stresses, the elongational rate and the film thickness among the bubbles to predict the rupture of the polymeric layer between the bubbles and its retraction. As a result, the foaming process model is able to make predictions on the final foam morphology, starting from any polymer/gas solution. Independent experiments to assess the validity of each step of the proposed approach were performed. In conclusion, the developed methodology allows to design the materials and processing conditions to control foam morphology. In the first part of this thesis, a general overview of the foaming process is supplied, focusing the attention on the crucial points of each foaming steps pointed out by the existent literature. The main part will be occupied by the contributions published during the years of this Ph. D. because they represent the steps ahead achieved with respect to the literature...|$|E
40|$|Magister Pharmaceuticae - MPharmThis {{study was}} based on Dioxy MP 14 (DMP), a brand of {{stabilized}} chlorine dioxide (SCD). The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of DMP is chlorine dioxide (CD) which is a potent oxidant and biocide. These properties have proved invaluable for various applications. The main goals of this study were: {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of DMP for disinfecting Mycobateria tuberculosis (TB) contaminated medical instruments, devices, floors and surfaces; to investigate the stability of DMP; and to explore possibilities for medical application of DMP. Evaluation of disinfectant activity of DMP on TB was performed using the spectrophotometric method, a modification of the European suspension test, EN 14348. M. bovis BCG was employed as surrogate in this test. Results were as follows: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC₉₀) = 12. 5 ppm; the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) = 15. 4 ppm; the Mycobactericidal Effect (ME) = 8. 8 log reduction; and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC₉₀) x minimum exposure time (CT) = 12. 5 ppm. s. The long term stability study of DMP was performed by monitoring the rate of degradation of DMP stored in the fridge (2 - 8 °C), in the oven (40 °C), and under ambient conditions (15 - 30 °C). Analytical methods of assessing DMP concentration was by Iodometric titration method. The shelf life of DMP stored in a transparent bottle at room temperature was 9. 8 weeks, as opposed to 52. 7 weeks when stored in an amber colored reagent bottle at the same temperature. Both oven samples had an expiry date of about 20 weeks and the fridge samples about 70 weeks. Foam formulations for a vaginal douche (VGD), mouth rinse (MRF), and foot/sit bubble bath (F/SBB) ], were developed in the laboratory. DMP and the formulated concentrate were designed to be mixed just prior to administration. During foam evaluation studies, a mechanical overhead stirrer was used to generate foam. Foamability was assessed by quantifying the amount of foam generated. The stability of foams were assessed by: 1) determining the rate of foam decay and the rate of foam drainage observed concurrently from foam loaded in a measuring cylinder; and 2) determining the life span of single bubbles of each foam system i. e. the <b>bubble</b> <b>breaking</b> time (BBT). The density of each foam system was also determined. Potentiometric acid base titration was used to select suitable adjuster alkali, and to show the benefits of employing a buffer. Concentrate development was initiated by a simple mixture of all the ingredients followed by stirring and observing the deviations from desired quality attributes of the product. The subsequent five processes were improvements designed to circumvent the shortcomings of the initial procedure to arrive at the optimized method E. Prototype formulations were employed to optimize excipient quantities to eventually arrive at an optimized master formula. In foam evaluation, it was found that sodium lauryl sulphate/ammonium lauryl sulphate/cocoamidopropyl betaine/cetostearyl alcohol (SLS/ALS/CAPB/CSA) foam system was the most appropriate to use in the formulation. NaOH was selected as the adjuster solution and KHP as the buffer. The dosage formula (DF) of the VGD and F/SBB was determined to be MDF = 5 ml of 50 ppm DMP + 5 ml concentrate + 40 ml water = 50 ml and that of MRF as MDF = 19 ml diluted concentrate + 1 ml of 50 ppm DMP. In conclusion, DMP was found to be a highly effective disinfectant against Mycobacteria. DMP has reasonable shelf life if stored appropriately. Pharmaceutical formulation from DMP was found to be delicate due to the narrow pH window of DMP stability, but is feasible...|$|E

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} numerical {{study of}} Taylor bubble breakup {{is carried out}}, where Taylor bubble flows in a horizontal T- section microchannel with T-junction bifurcation. The numerical simulation is carried out by using the Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) multiphase model in ANSYS Fluent®. The Taylor bubble is formed at the upstream T-junction where air and water enter through two inlets perpendicular to each other. At {{the end of the}} channel, the Taylor <b>bubble</b> <b>breaks</b> up into two equal sizes at the bifurcated T junction. For controlled breakup of the Taylor bubble into two unequal lengths, an obstacle is positioned at the T-junction bifurcation to which the Taylor bubble strikes. The bubble breakup will be symmetrical, asymmetrical or no breakup depending on the position and height of the obstacle. In this work the obstacle position varied from X = 0 to 0. 1 mm, where X is the distance from the center of T-junction bifurcation to the obstacle and height, is varied from Y = 0. 05 to 0. 2 mm. When X = 0 (i. e. the obstacle is positioned at the center), the symmetrical bubble breakup occurs and when X > 0 asymmetrical bubble breakup occurs. When the <b>bubble</b> <b>breaks</b> into unequal lengths, the length of the bifurcated bubble is higher along the outlet path opposite to that of the obstacle positioned. In this work, some parameters are calculated such as bubble length ratio, breakup length, breakup time and pressure drop. The result reveals that the bubble length ratio decreases as the obstacle height increases for a particular position of the obstacle. Similarly the breakup length and the breakup time decreases as the obstacle height increases for a particular obstacle position. From the results, it also observed that the pressure drop increases as the obstacle height increases for a particular position of the obstacle...|$|R
