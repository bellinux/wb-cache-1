5|$|At the marabout's zawiya, Eberhardt was {{weakened}} by fever. She returned to Aïn Sefra, and was treated {{at the military}} hospital. She left the hospital against medical advice and asked Ehnni, from whom she had been separated for several months, to join her. Reunited on 20October 1904, they rented a small mud house. The following day, a flash flood struck the area. As soon as the waters subsided, Lyautey launched a search for her. Ehnni was discovered almost immediately, saying that Eberhardt had been swept away by the water. Based on this information, Lyautey and his men searched the surrounding area for several days before deciding to explore {{the ruins of the}} house the couple had stayed in. Her body was crushed under one of the house's supporting beams. The exact circumstances of her death were never discovered. While some biographers have raised suspicions regarding Ehnni, most believe it more likely that Eberhardt, who had always believed she would die young, instead accepted her fate. Mackworth speculated that after initially trying to run from the floodwaters, Eberhardt instead turned back to face them. <b>Blanch</b> argued that due to Eberhardt's history of suicidal tendencies, she probably would have still chosen to stay in the area even if she had known the flood was coming. Lyautey buried Eberhardt in Aïn Sefra and had a marble tombstone, engraved with her adopted name in Arabic and her birth name in French, placed on her grave.|$|E

25|$|Why {{does the}} Court not apply this clear law to these clear facts, and conclude, as I do, that the funding scheme {{here is a}} clear {{constitutional}} violation? The answer must be, in part, that the Court fails to confront the evidence {{set out in the}} preceding section. Throughout its opinion, the Court refers uniformly to Wide Awakes Christian viewpoint or its religious perspective, and in distinguishing funding of Wide Awake from the funding of a church, the Court maintains that Wide Awake is not a religious institution, at least in the usual sense. The Court does not quote the magazine's adoption of Saint Paul's exhortation to awaken to the nearness of salvation, or any of its articles enjoining readers to accept Jesus Christ, or the religious verses, or the religious textual analyses, or the suggested prayers. And so, it is easy for the Court to lose sight of what the University students and the Court of Appeals found so obvious, and to <b>blanch</b> the patently and frankly evangelistic character of the magazine by unrevealing allusions to religious points of view.|$|E

After a slow decline following the dynastic union of the Crown of Aragon with the Kingdom of Castile, this came definitely to an end with the Expulsion of the Moriscos in 1609 by the Hispanic Monarchy, which represented the loss of up to one third {{of the population of the}} Kingdom of Valencia and took the main agricultural labor force away.In 1707, in the context of the War of the Spanish Succession, and by means of the Nova Planta decrees, king Philip V of Spain abolished the Kingdom of Valencia, and the rest of states belonging to the former Crown of Aragon and which had retained some autonomy, and subordinated it to the structure of the Kingdom of Castile and its laws and customs. As a result of this, the institutions and laws created by the Furs of Valencia (Furs de València) were abolished and the usage of the Valencian language in official instances and education was forbidden.

The finite-element technique was used to predict the temperature distribution within the tissue during <b>blanching.</b> The temperature-related behaviour of the enzyme indicated that <b>blanching</b> between 60 and 70 degreesC induced thermal activation of PME in <b>blanched</b> potatoes. The temperature distribution in the tissue during <b>blanching</b> showed that activation takes place as soon as the tissue reaches an average temperature above 50 degreesC. However, the temperature dependence of the absolute residual PME activity in the tissue, when <b>blanching</b> at temperatures between 50 and 70 degreesC, did not follow Arrehenius' law. The degree of PME activity in the <b>blanched</b> tissue was found to depend on the "effective exposure time" to the temperature at which the activation/deactivation of the enzyme takes places. Thermal activation of PME in potato tissue occurred during the first two minutes of <b>blanching.</b> Longer heating times induced rapid deactivation of the enzyme in the tissue.

Eberhardt nursed her father, growing closer to him. She also commenced a relationship and became engaged to Rehid Bay, an Armenian diplomat with whom she had been friends and possibly lovers when she was seventeen. Though Trophimowsky approved of the engagement, the relationship soon ended. Historian Lesley <b>Blanch</b> attributes the relationship's downfall to Bey being assigned to Stockholm. Trophimowsky died in May. <b>Blanch</b> attributes the death to a chloral overdose, with which Eberhardt may have intentionally euthanised him. Eberhardt intended to sell the villa, although Trophimowsky's legitimate wife opposed the execution of the will. After several weeks of legal contentions, Eberhardt mortgaged the property and returned to Africa on the first available ship. With both parents dead, she considered herself free of human attachments and able to live as a vagabond. Eberhardt relinquished her mother's name, and called herself Si Mahmoud Saadi.

40|$|Abstract The date {{industry}} faces {{economic losses}} due to non-conformities with quality standards (pre and post-harvest defects). The present study deals with {{two types of}} discarded date palm: Medjoul (post-harvest defects) and Confitera (pre-harvest cracks) with the aim to obtain valuable products. Dates were processed to obtain paste and <b>blanching</b> water. Nutritional value and antioxidant properties of the paste and <b>blanching</b> water were determined. Medjoul paste and <b>blanching</b> water have demonstrated {{to be a good}} source of sugars (33. 02 % and 5. 44 %, respectively) whereas Confitera paste and <b>blanching</b> water have an important content in phenols and flavonoids, which in particular confers antioxidant properties to Confitera <b>blanching</b> water. Furthermore both date pastes are a good source of fiber. <b>Blanching</b> process especially affects Confitera cultivar since a huge amount of organic acids, phenolics and flavonoids are solubilized and leaked during date processing, increasing the bioactive content in Confitera <b>blanching</b> water. These results showed the opportunity to incorporate these new products from non-commercial dates as functional ingredients into the food chain helping, whereas improving, waste management in the date industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of different treatments, i. e., crushing, {{high temperature short time}} (90 degrees C/ 4 min) (HTST) and low temperature long time (60 degrees C/ 40 min) (LTLT) <b>blanching,</b> acidification (pH 4. 3), and sequences of these treatments on the folate poly-gamma-glutamate profile and stability were investigated. In this study, broccoli {{was used as}} a case study. Regarding the folate poly-gamma-glutamate profile, endogenous folate poly-gamma-glutamates in broccoli florets were found predominantly as hepta- and hexa-gamma-glutamates. Crushing raw broccoli, acidification and LTLT <b>blanching</b> enhanced folate deconjugation resulting in monoglutamate, di- and tri-gamma-glutamates. Compared to other treatments, HTST <b>blanching</b> preformed prior to crushing resulted in the highest concentration of long chain poly-gamma-glutamates. Regarding folate poly-gamma-glutamates stability, acidification combined with LTLT <b>blanching</b> decreased folate stability whereas HTST <b>blanching</b> combined with different sequences of <b>blanching</b> and crushing did not affect folate poly-gamma-glutamates stability. It was concluded that crushing (prior to heating), acidification and <b>blanching</b> could be strategically applied to increase the folate monoglutamate content of broccoli. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
