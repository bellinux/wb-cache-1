The instruments which undoubtedly meet the above requirements are a civil law contract and an administrative agreement. The author has carried out the analysis of the said acts defining their characteristic features and pointing out to {{the differences between the two}} insruments. According to the author, common features of both acts are relatively equal status of participants (parties) and their unanimous expression of the will to conclude an act on cooperation. In the author's opinion, the law in force seems to point out to the tendency of a further development of a civil law contract and an administrative agreement as forms of the administrative agencies' activity in the management of the state economy. He indicates that the appearance of new types of <b>bilateral</b> <b>acts</b> and the transformation of the traditional ones is a natural course for the evolution of legal forms of the administrative activity. He stresses the need to work out a consistent conception, expressed in legal norms, of applying those acts by the administrative agencies. He presented some elements of such a conception and formulated some postulates as to the future law. Finally, he is against an excessively detailed legal regulation of the said instruments.

40|$|Resume Contract of {{employment}} Contract {{of employment}} is the <b>bilateral</b> legal <b>act</b> that creates employment relationship. It {{is used in}} labour law and this contract sets rights and obligations between employer and employee (worker). These rights and obligation are mediated between two parties, which are in equal position. Because it is a contract, {{it is necessary for}} both parties to agree on whole content of contract, otherwise employment contract and also employment relationship can't be created. Employment in Czech republic can also be created by nomination, but this type is exceptional. Both employment contract and nomination are set in Act No. 262 / 2006 Coll., labour code. Contract of employment is optional contract and so it's up to parties to the contract to set terms of this contract. Thanks to these terms, both parties will know what to expect during employment. Before concluding contract of employment, the employer is to provide the employee with full information about the rights and obligations ensuing from the proposed contract (such as working condition).

40|$|Background: A recent {{microarray}} study {{identified a}} set of genes whose combined expression patterns were predictive of poor outcome in a cohort of adult adrenocortical tumors (ACTs). The difference between the expression values measured by qRT-PCR of DLGAP 5 and PINK 1 genes was the best molecular predictor of recurrence and malignancy. Among the adrenocortical carcinomas, the combined expression of BUB 1 B and PINK 1 genes was the most reliable predictor of overall survival. The prognostic and molecular heterogeneity of ACTs raises the need to study the applicability of these molecular markers in other cohorts. Objective: To validate the combined expression of BUB 1 B, DLGAP 5, and PINK 1 as outcome predictor in ACTs from a Brazilian cohort of adult and pediatric patients. Patients and methods: BUB 1 B, DLGAP 5, and PINK 1 expression was assessed by quantitative PCR in 53 ACTs from 52 patients - 24 pediatric and 28 adults (one pediatric patient presented a <b>bilateral</b> asynchronous <b>ACT).</b> Results: DLGAP 5 PINK 1 and BUB 1 B PINK 1 were strong predictors of disease-free survival and overall survival, respectively, among adult patients with ACT. In the pediatric cohort, these molecular predictors were only marginally associated with disease-free survival but not with overall survival. Conclusion: This study confirms the prognostic value of the combined expression of BUB 1 B, DLGAP 5, and PINK 1 genes in a Brazilian group of adult ACTs. Among pediatric ACTs, other molecular predictors of outcome are required.

OVX C 57 BL/ 6 J mice, aged 12 weeks, were orally administrated daily with vehicle or 17 b-oestradiol (3. 2 mg/kg), SWH (60 % ethanol crude extract; 1. 0 g/kg), SWA (water eluate; 0. 570 g/kg), SWB (30 % ethanol eluate; 0. 128 g/kg) or SWC (50 and 95 % ethanol eluates; 0. 189 g/kg) for 12 weeks. The effects of the different fractions on bone properties in the OVX mice model were studied. In addition, their effects on osteoblast proliferation and differentiation were evaluated in UMR 106 cells. SWC significantly restored bone mineral density and improved bone size and bone content parameters in the femur and tibia as well as increased biomechanical strength at the tibia diaphysis in OVX mice. Similarly, SWC was the most potent fraction in stimulating cell proliferation and differentiation in UMR 106 cells. Also, SWC did not alter uterus weight in OVX mice. Nine major peaks, seven lignans and two phenolic acids, in the HPLC fingerprint of the SWC fraction were identified, isolated and characterised. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that SWC was the most potent fraction in SWH that exerted antiosteoporotic effects.

40|$|France and Germany {{have played}} a pivotal role in the history and {{politics}} of European integration. Yet, paradoxically, a study that systematically investigates the interrelated reality of Franco-German bilateralism and multilateral European integration has been conspicuously lacking. Formulating an approach the authors call "embedded bilateralism", this book offers exactly that. It scrutinizes in empirical and historical detail the bilateral Franco-German order and France and Germany's joint role in shaping Europe over the past half century. The book addresses two key questions regarding France and Germany in Europe from the Elysée Treaty to the twenty-first century: Why have France and Germany continued to hang together in an especially tight relationship for over five decades amidst frequently dramatic domestic change, lasting differences, and fundamental international transformation? And why has the joint Franco-German impact on shaping Europe's polity and European policies, while fundamental, proved so uneven across political domains and time? In answer to the first question, Shaping Europe argues that the actions and practices of the Franco-German order-its regularized <b>bilateral</b> intergovernmentalism, symbolic <b>acts</b> and practices, and parapublic underpinnings-together have rendered this bilateral connection historically resilient and politically adaptable. Regarding the second question, the book holds that different combinations of a limited number of factors located at the bilateral, domestic, regional European, and international levels explain central aspects of variation. Together, these factors condition and modulate France and Germany's joint impact on Europe. In pursuing its research questions, theoretical work, historical reconstructions, and empirical analyses, Shaping Europe fruitfully combines the study of European integration, EU politics and policymaking, Franco-German affairs, and French and German politics with general theorizing and conceptual grounding in international relations and political science.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the process of formulating policies and lobbying to set carbon limit values for new passenger cars in the European Union. Structurally the contents of the dissertation are embedded in two phases of the policy cycle: in the agenda-setting and in the policy formulation. In the context of the agenda-setting process the dissertation highlights which developments preceded the EU Commission’s legislative proposal for limiting carbon emissions for passenger cars. These statements take particular account of the idea of outlining as comprehensive a picture as possible of this lobbying process. In addition, they also provide {{a better understanding of the}} actual policy formulation process. The dissertation focuses in particular on the national, i. e. the German, policy formulation as this was not only key to the resolution of the current policy conflict but also to the success of the German automotive industry within the lobbying process. Actor-centred policy research and – embedded within it – the approach of actor-centred institutionalism and the network analysis serve as the dissertation’s theoretical reference framework. In the context of actor-centred institutionalism, developed by Renate Mayntz and Fritz Scharpf, the actors participating, their positions, interests and/or preferences, as well as their institutional contexts, can be portrayed. Actor-centred institutionalism functions as an analytical approach to resolving policy conflicts. With its help we can find the answer to the question which institutional contexts have led to a solution for a problem in the case study presented here. In this context I put forward the hypothesis that the major impetus to resolve the conflict did not stem primarily from the European institutions formally participating in the process, i. e. the EU Parliament and the EU Council of Minsters, but from an alternative institutional arrangement of the participating (inter-) national elite. This consisted of – and this is one outcome of the dissertation – a network comprised of the heads of state and government of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain. The <b>bilateral</b> German-French compromise <b>acted</b> as a major impetus in resolving the conflict for the entire policy formulation process, in particular with a view to the Council, This should be viewed as an act of hierarchical management, although complex institutional structures, i. e. the formal agreement of Parliament and Council were required for it to be implemented. Apart from analysing institutional contexts and their impact on the resolution of problems, the dissertation should also be considered as a contribution to research into interest groups. The focus is on two issues. I first examined how the German automotive industry, represented by the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), asserted its interests and why the participating environmental associations did not succeed in doing so. I have also analysed the question which role the European automotive association ACEA played as compared to that of the national automotive association. As regards how the German automotive industry succeeded in asserting its interests, I refer back to the network analysis. It is based inter alia on the works of Adrienne Windhoff-Héritier, Frans van Waarden, Patrick Kenis, Volker Schneider and Frank Janning. I have also included some observations by David Marsh and R. A. W. Rhodes. I put forward the hypothesis that the existence of network-like structures still plays a key role in successful lobbying processes. The study makes it clear that network-like structures – composed of political decision-makers in key positions both in European and national institutions – played a major role in the success of the lobbying process in the case of the German automotive industry. The basis for the activation of these network-like structures is the German automotive industry’s economic importance. In contrast to the environmental associations, this crucial resource advantage makes it possible for it to be assured of the support of key decision-makers - in particular the German Chancellor. As regards the division of roles between the ACEA and VDA I would like to state that the ACEA - due to its institutional structure which covers the diverse interests of the manufacturers - could not establish a joint preference, even after lengthy internal debates – particularly on one important issue. The consequence was that on certain issues the European automotive association was not able to present a joint position vis-à-vis the delegates of the political institutions. Thus the main conflictual issues, also those within the ACEA, were ultimately resolved by the political decision-makers, i. e. in these cases the issues through the German-French compromise...|$|R
40|$|Agreements and {{administration}} of a decedent's estate In this thesis, I shall discuss agreements entered into by parties to a decedent's estate on {{administration of the}} estate. These agreements (shareholders' agreements) may cause problems in either {{the relationships between the}} shareholders or their relationships with third parties outside the estate. My particular aim is to assess: (1) how the mutual rights and obligations are arranged once the shareholders have entered into a joint administration agreement, and (2) what effect a joint administration agreement has when one of the parties in a legal relationship comes from outside the estate. In addition to actual contracts, I shall discuss situations (agreement-like situations) where acts performed by the parties create new rights and obligations. One example of such a situation is ex post facto ratification (ratihabition). In addition to clarify the contents of the norms, I shall seek to systematize the set of norms concerning shareholders' agreements. Therefore, this study falls within the sphere of legal dogmatics. In this thesis, I shall particularly focus on the possible effects of the interaction between contractual parties on the legal relations between both the parties to the estate and between the contractual parties and third parties. In this respect, the subject extends to other areas of the Finnish contract doctrine, and the original subject of this study - joint administration agreements - becomes a research tool as well. The {{purpose of this study is}} to establish to what extent the interaction between contractual parties (or joint actors) may create, alter or revoke rights and obligations in the same ways as specific declarations of intent. A particular point of my interest is the dynamic features of the Finnish contract doctrine. For this reason, the starting-point of my study is the hypothesis that a typical agreement on the administration of a decedent's estate and the legal relations created by the agreement forms a process. This hypothesis will be tested in this study. This study shows that the Finnish contract doctrine, which has largely been created for the purposes of <b>bilateral</b> legal <b>acts</b> related to the sale of movables, does not easily apply to the regulation of continuous contractual relationships such as those discussed in this study. Changes in long-term contractual relations occur only gradually and on a factual level. The status of the agreement which has originally defined the rights and obligations of the shareholders can change with the shareholders' acts (whether these are active or passive). The shareholder's acts may indicate that they no longer consider an original term of the agreement binding on them. As a result of the interaction between the shareholders, internal agreements (of a certain kind) may emerge during the contractual relationship, which will considerably alter the role of the original agreement setting out the norms for the relationships between the shareholders. Accordingly, the shareholders' contractual relationship is a non-static process. The shareholders' legal positions may also be affected after the conclusion of the contract by changes in the circumstances, in which case the doctrines on excess difficulty or force majeure apply, for instance. Furthermore, the processual nature of the contractual relationship is effected by several flexible norms (Section 36 of the Contracts Act; Chapter 24, Section 5 of the Code of Inheritance; and the principle of fidelity). It can therefore be said that the importance of the declarations of intent (and events at the time of these declarations) underlying the shareholders' rights and obligations and creating contractual relations declines as the interaction between shareholders increases and circumstances change. The shareholders' legal positions with regard to an undistributed estate are thus determined on the basis of a very broad range of material. In some cases, such material implies an agreement or authorization between the shareholders (or between the estate and third parties). Occasionally, such agreements or authorizations imply an ex post facto ratification (ratihabition). In some rare cases, the shareholders or the decedent's estate have, under certain facts and circumstances, incurred an obligation under Chapter 18, Section 3 of the Code of Commerce to pay compensation for the benefit gained. Considering that an obligation incurred by a decedent's estate or the shareholders of a decedent's estate may often be based on other facts in law than a specific agreement, we could, similarly to Kurt Grönfors, call this a case of facts giving rise to an obligation. Facts giving rise to an obligation often affect contractual relationships even where they do not lead to an actual contract. Ratihabition, for instance, is often evidenced by the parties' actions rather than their specific declarations of intent. A commitment (of which entering a contract is also an example) may be a process which consists of a continuum of facts in law. Sometimes (although rarely) an obligation may emerge even without the principal being aware of a party's lack of authority to perform an act (Chapter 18, Section 3 of the Code of Commerce). If the principal is aware of an unauthorized act but does not respond to it in any way, this may imply that the act has their ex post facto ratification. An active act performed by a party may directly create an agreement or a comparable state of affairs. We could therefore see a commitment as a process and speak of facts establishing an obligation. Examining whether acts performed by shareholders have created an agreement requires considering the type of the agreement. For instance, the facts and circumstances referring to leaving an estate undistributed (joint administration agreement) can reasonably be expected to manifest a clear intention of a commitment. Leaving an estate undistributed is usually a very significant legal act for the shareholders as it deprives them of an opportunity to place the estate under an administrator or have the estate distributed during the life of the agreement. The situation is different if there is already undeniably a joint administration agreement between the shareholders and the problem is whether the shareholders can be considered to have altered their contractual relationship through an internal agreement. The legal situation created by a joint distribution agreement (and sometimes administration under Chapter 18 of the Code of Inheritance) must often be given a specific meaning. A successful determination of a rational meaning which corresponds best to the shareholders' intentions usually requires a low threshold for agreements. In practice, this specifically means that other acts of the shareholders than actual declarations of intent may gain significance easier when internal agreements are considered. This will also emphasize the processual nature of the contractual relationship between the shareholders. An ex post facto ratification of a legal act constitutes a recognition of the binding nature of that act. Unlike a contract, such a ratification is not future-oriented; it does not imply that any other future acts of the other party will be accepted as well. Consequently, the emergence of a ratification is based on lighter facts and circumstances than an agreement. The same applies for authorization. Because the authorizing party always has the option of revoking the authorization, an authorization is less restrictive on a principal's freedom of action than a contract. Paying compensation for benefit gained is the least compelling of the above obligations. It may have all the constituent elements of an obligation even if the act performed by the party showed no intention of a commitment. After all, in the case of compensation for benefit, principals' are bound by other parties' legal acts only to the extent of the benefit they may gain from it. If that benefit is less than the commitment, the obligation is limited to the amount of the benefit, or the amount of the enrichment. Whether any of the constituent elements referred to by the legal institutions mentioned above exist cannot be determined on the basis of a single legal act. Examination of social contractual relationships such as decedent's estates requires a more than atomistic approach. If the contract as a whole and the operating environment are taken into account in the legal acts performed by the parties in their contractual relationships, exclusion of such aspects when judicial decisions are being made will easily lead to an outcome which the parties have not anticipated at all, and the contract(s) will have failed to provide and ensure the stability and predictability expected from it. This study shows that, for the dynamics of the relationship between the contracting parties, the processual nature of a contractual relationship has more weight than that of an agreement (if the actual agreement is defined as a set of facts that consist of declarations of intent creating certain rights and obligations; in other words, defined as a legal act). Because of the above legal institutions, the shareholders' right and obligations cannot be considered static. This is illustrated by the main claim of my thesis: joint administration should not examined in the light of the norms of the Code of Inheritance and the principle of joint administration alone. As joint administration continues and cooperation increases, the rules of contract law gain more weight in joint administration. To this day, joint administration has been rather too narrowly considered a problem in the application of the Code of Inheritance, particularly Chapter 18, Section 2, which concerns the principle of joint administration. The following remark on joint administration agreements is also related to the main claim of my thesis: While the time when the declarations of intent which establish the original contractual relationship (non-distribution agreement) are made still remains the key moment for determining the shareholders' rights and obligations, the significance of that moment for shareholders' agreements is lower than usual; in this case, applying the time of the declarations of intent as the main systemic rule for determining the moment when legal consequences begin is clearly a weaker rule than in the case of a sale of movables, for instance. With regard to shareholders' agreements (and other long-term agreements), judicial decisions should be made in a manner which involves the option of departing from the main rule referred to above if it is evident from the parties' actions that they had not intended to fix their mutual rights and obligations to that specific time. Antti Kolehmainen käsittelee väitöskirjassaan kuolinpesien osakashallinnon synnyttämiä ongelmia. Osakashallinnossa pesän osakkaat voivat täydentää jäämistöoikeudellista sääntelyä keskinäisillä sopimuksilla. Tällöin osakkaille voi kuitenkin jäädä epäselväksi, millaisia oikeuksia ja velvollisuuksia heillä on ja kuka saa tehdä päätöksiä pesän puolesta. Teos antaa vastauksia muun muassa näihin kysymyksiin. Jäämistöhallintoa koskevista sopimuksista aiheutuvat ongelmat eivät aina jää vain pesän sisäisiksi. Osakkaat voivat sopia, että vain joku heistä edustaa kuolinpesää tehtäessä sopimuksia ulkopuolisten kanssa. Näissä tilanteissa voi jäädä tulkinnanvaraiseksi, onko pesän puolesta toimineella osakkaalla lopulta ollut oikeus edustaa kuolinpesää ja saako hänen kanssaan asioinut ulkopuolinen suojaa muiden osakkaiden vaatimuksilta. Osakkaiden tekemät sopimukset saattavat aiheuttaa ongelmia esimerkiksi pesänselvittäjän ja pesänjakajan toimivallan kannalta. Tässä teoksessa käsitellään näitäkin kysymyksiä. Varsinaisten sopimusten lisäksi Kolehmainen tarkastelee työssään myös sopimuksen kaltaisia tilanteita, joissa osapuolten toiminta synnyttää oikeuksia ja velvollisuuksia. Antti Kolehmaisen tutkimuksessa tullaan siihen tulokseen, että tähän asti yhteishallinto on nähty liian ahtaasti perintökaaren ja etenkin ns. yhteishallintoperiaatetta ilmentävän PK 18 : 2 :n soveltamisongelmana. Osakashallintoa ei tule kuitenkaan tarkastella pelkästään perintökaaren normien ja yhteishallintoperiaatteen valossa. Osakashallinnon pitkittyessä ja osakkaiden keskinäisen yhteistoiminnan lisääntyessä myös velvoiteoikeudellisen säännöstön merkitys yhteishallinnon normittajana kasvaa. Kuolinpesän osakkaiden väliset suhteet ovat dynaamisia, heidän oikeutensa ja velvollisuutensa elävät yhteishallinnon aikana erilaisten velvoiteoikeudellisten oikeusinstituuttien johdosta.
