25|$|In 1920 the French {{automobile}} and aircraft pioneer Gabriel Voisin experimented with systems that modulated the hydraulic braking pressure on his aircraft brakes {{to reduce the}} risk of tire slippage. These systems use a flywheel and valve attached to a hydraulic line that feeds the brake cylinders. The flywheel is attached to a drum that runs at the same speed as the wheel. In normal braking, the drum and flywheel should spin at the same speed. However, when a wheel slows down, then the drum would do the same, leaving the flywheel spinning at a faster rate. This causes the valve to open, allowing a small amount of brake fluid to bypass the master cylinder into a local reservoir, lowering the pressure on the cylinder and releasing the brakes. The use of the drum and flywheel meant the valve only opened when the wheel was turning. In testing, a 30% improvement in <b>braking</b> <b>performance</b> was noted, because the pilots immediately applied full brakes instead of slowly increasing pressure in order to find the skid point. An additional benefit was the elimination of burned or burst tires.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] The aim of {{this study}} is to find the optimal {{geometric}} parameters of the wedge disc <b>brake</b> <b>performance</b> using experimental and statistical studies. A standard response surface methodology called central composite design is applied to study four geometric parameters each with three levels. A total of thirty experimental tests are run using the brake dynamometer to evaluate the main and interaction effect of these variables namely; number of rotor holes, number of friction material slots, friction material length and friction material thickness. The variability in dependent variables is explained by coefficient of determination. The model equation is used to predict the optimum value and subsequently to clarify the interaction between the parameters within the specified range. The experimental results indicate that the proposed mathematical model successfully describes the performance of adaptive wedge brakes within the limits of the geometric parameters that are being investigated.

40|$|Abstract.

On these basses, the author puts forward the prediction model of automobile braking distance with artificial neural network method.

40|$|This work investigates and {{provides}} a methodology that enables better prediction of <b>brake</b> <b>performance.</b> Aircraft <b>brake</b> <b>performance</b> depends on the tribological properties of the friction couple used in the brake design. The behaviour of this couple combines both surface and bulk characteristics of the material. The increase in aircraft performance requirements {{has led to the}} development of new brake designs and new friction materials. The development of brakes for large commercial aircraft has stabilised to that of a carbon-carbon composite multi-disk brake design. The results of this investigation established a relationship between mean mass loading and the mean friction radius of the brake. This relationship provides a statistically good description of the results and will provide the <b>brake</b> <b>performance</b> engineer with a useful tool. In addition, the variance within the results of the 100 Normals aircraft qualification programme was also studied. In this case the relationship is not particularly good at describing the results. A case study has been included to promote further understanding of the developed methodology and to illustrate some of the trade-offs required when designing a carbon brake. The design of a multi-disk brake is a complex engineering task that requires many specialist engineering disciplines such as structural analysis and dynamic analysis etc. The wider context of aircraft braking is even broader and requires not only mechanical engineering skills but also electronic and software engineering.

500|$|Most of the {{braking force}} of {{standard}} upright bikes {{comes from the}} front wheel. As the analysis above shows, if the brakes themselves are strong enough, the rear wheel is easy to skid, while the front wheel often can generate enough stopping force to flip the rider and bike over the front wheel. This is called a stoppie if the rear wheel is lifted but the bike does not flip, or an endo (abbreviated form of end-over-end) if the bike flips. On long or low bikes, however, such as cruiser motorcycles and recumbent bicycles, the front tire will skid instead, possibly causing a loss of balance. [...] Assuming no loss of balance, {{it is possible to}} calculate optimum <b>braking</b> <b>performance</b> depending on the bike's geometry, the location of center of gravity of bike and rider, and the maximum coefficient of friction.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike car {{disc brakes}} that are buried within the wheel, bike disc brakes {{are in the}} {{airstream}} and have optimum cooling. Although cast iron discs have a porous surface which give superior <b>braking</b> <b>performance,</b> such discs rust {{in the rain and}} become unsightly. Accordingly, motorcycle discs are usually stainless steel, drilled, slotted or wavy to disperse rain water. Modern motorcycle discs tend to have a floating design whereby the disc [...] "floats" [...] on bobbins and can move slightly, allowing better disc centering with a fixed caliper. A floating disc also avoids disc warping and reduces heat transfer to the wheel hub. Calipers have evolved from simple single-piston units to two-, four- and even six-piston items.

Front brakes absorb most of the braking forces, while the rear brake serves mainly to balance the motorcycle during braking. Modern sport bikes typically have twin large front discs, with a much smaller single rear disc. Bikes that are particularly fast or heavy may have vented discs.|$|E
