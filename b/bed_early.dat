5|$|Mansfield {{spent the}} {{remainder}} of his life at Kenwood House. Most of his time was spent maintaining the grounds. In the summer, he was visited by groups of barristers who informed him of the goings-on at court. On 1 August 1792 he was made Earl of Mansfield, in the County of Middlesex. On 10 March 1793, he complained of feeling sleepy, and although he recovered the next day, by 12 March, he was again complaining of a need for sleep. He went to <b>bed</b> <b>early</b> and remained asleep until 18 March, when he finally died. His body was buried in the North Transept of Westminster Abbey. Mansfield left a large amount of money after his death, including land worth £26,000. He gave £2,000 to Francis Buller.|$|E

25|$|Hannibal made careful {{preparations}} {{to break}} out of the trap, but not through a pitched battle as the Romans had hoped. The day before Hannibal put his plan in motion, he had most of his men eat a hearty supper and go to <b>bed</b> <b>early</b> while leaving the campfires burning. 2,000 oxen from the captured herds were selected, along with 2,000 camp followers to drive the cattle and 2,000 spearmen to guard the whole gang, cattle and all. Dry wood and fagots were tied on the horns of the oxen. An officer called Hasdrubal, in charge of army supplies as his role as Quarter master general (the same who would later lead the heavy cavalry at Cannae), oversaw the whole operation. Once the preparations were complete, this group was to move towards the pass being guarded by 4,000 Romans. However, combat with the Romans or capturing the pass was not to be their objective. There was a saddle below the camp of Fabius to the east, and on the north west of the pass, at the foot of Mount Callicula. The Carthaginian spearmen were to capture and hold the saddle. There is a story recorded by Appian (Roman History 7.3.14) that Hannibal executed 5,000 prisoners so that they would not cause trouble before the march, an incident which is not mentioned by either Polybius or Livy.|$|E
500|$|At {{some time}} during the night of 24/25 November 1974, Nick Drake died at his home ("Far Leys") in Tanworth-in-Arden, from an {{overdose}} of amitriptyline, a type of antidepressant. He had gone to <b>bed</b> <b>early</b> after spending the afternoon visiting a friend. His mother said that around dawn he left his room for the kitchen. His family was used to hearing him do this many times before but, during this instance, he {{did not make a}} sound. They presumed he was eating a bowl of cereal. He returned to his room a short while later, and took some pills [...] "to help him sleep".|$|E
500|$|Part of the {{attraction}} for the writers {{is that they}} are able to break the rules and include violence that would not make a regular episode. In some cases, the writers will have an idea that is too violent and far-fetched or too short for a normal episode, but {{can be used as a}} segment in the seasonal special. Several of the writers, former executive producer David Mirkin among them, believe that the episodes should be scary and not just funny. [...] "Treehouse of Horror V" [...] has been described by Mirkin as being one of [...] "the most intense, disturbing Halloween show ever" [...] as it was filled with violence and gore in response to new censorship rules. Earlier [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] episodes began with Marge issuing a disclaimer that [...] "if you have sensitive children, maybe you should tuck them into <b>bed</b> <b>early</b> tonight instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow." [...] However, these episodes seem mild compared to the carnage that followed in later episodes, according to Jean, who calls it [...] "a societal thing". [...] He points out that his 10-year-old daughter loves films like Coraline, and that, [...] " [...] the age of scary stories [...] appropriateness has gotten lower." ...|$|E

500|$|The Quadrophenia tour {{started in}} Stoke on Trent in October and was {{immediately}} beset with problems. Daltrey resisted Townshend's wish to add Joe Cocker's keyboardist Chris Stainton (who played on the album) to the touring band. As a compromise, Townshend assembled the keyboard and synthesizer parts on backing tapes, as such a strategy had been successful with [...] "Baba O'Riley" [...] and [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again". Unfortunately, the technology was not sophisticated {{enough to deal with}} the demands of the music; added to this issue, tour rehearsals had been interrupted due to an argument that culminated in Daltrey punching Townshend and knocking him out cold. At a gig in Newcastle, the tapes completely malfunctioned, and an enraged Townshend dragged sound-man Bob Pridden on-stage, screamed at him, kicked all the amps over and partially destroyed the backing tapes. The show was abandoned for an [...] "oldies" [...] set, {{at the end of which}} Townshend smashed his guitar and Moon kicked over his drumkit. The Independent described this gig as one of the worst of all time. The US tour started on 20 November at the Cow Palace in Daly City, California; Moon passed out during [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again" [...] and during [...] "Magic Bus". Townshend asked the audience, [...] "Can anyone play the drums?—I mean somebody good." [...] An audience member, Scot Halpin, filled in for the rest of the show. After a show in Montreal, the band (except for Daltrey, who retired to <b>bed</b> <b>early)</b> caused so much damage to their hotel room, including destroying an antique painting and ramming a marble table through a wall, that federal law enforcement arrested them.|$|E
500|$|Harding went to <b>bed</b> <b>early</b> in {{the evening}} of July 27, 1923. Later that night, he called for his physician, Charles E. Sawyer, {{complaining}} of pain in the upper abdomen. Sawyer {{thought it was a}} recurrence of a dietary upset, but Dr. Joel T. Boone suspected a heart problem. The next day, as the train rushed to San Francisco, Harding felt better, and when they arrived on the morning of July 29, 1923, he insisted on walking from the train to the car, which rushed him to the Palace Hotel where he suffered a relapse. Doctors found that not only was Harding's heart causing problems, but he also had pneumonia, a serious matter in the days before effective antibiotics. When treated with caffeine and digitalis, Harding seemed to improve. He was pleased when his planned foreign policy address advocating membership in the World Court was released to the press by Hoover and received a favorable reception. By the afternoon of August 2, 1923, doctors allowed Harding to sit up in bed. That evening, about 7:30 pm, he was listening to his wife read him a flattering article about him from The Saturday Evening Post, [...] "A Calm Review of a Calm Man". When she paused to plump his pillows, he said, [...] "That's good, read some more". As Florence Harding resumed, her husband twisted convulsively and collapsed, and she raced to get the doctors. They attempted stimulants, but were unable to revive him, and President Harding {{died of a heart attack}} on August 2, 1923, at the age of 57. His death was initially attributed to a cerebral hemorrhage, as doctors at the time did not generally understand the symptoms of a heart attack.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{not until}} two years later that Grove stood again in Chamonix, this time {{accompanied}} by Edward Buxton and Reginald Macdonald, {{both of whom were}} keen to attain the unclimbed peak, especially as the Aiguille de Bionnassay was [...] "the only peak passing thirteen thousand feet which had escaped the devastations of the Alpine Club". Their suggestion was not met enthusiastically by the two usual guides whom Grove employed: Jean Pierre Cachat and Michel Payot. Later that day, however, (27 July) they hired a carriage to carry them to Les Ouches (Les Houches) and then walked to the Pavillon de Belle Vue from where they could view the ice-clad slopes of the Bionnassay towering above them through what Grove describes as [...] "the driving clouds and mist of a stormy afternoon". They retired to <b>bed</b> <b>early,</b> waking again at midnight for a 1 a.m. start, noting the sky was clear, but had a treacherous nature; fog banks were building up on the horizon and wisps of thin cloud streaked ominously across the sky.|$|E

2500|$|In 1961, the American children's {{anthology}} TV series Shirley Temple's Storybook (hosted by Shirley Temple) {{included an}} adaptation of Pippi Longstocking, Episode 2-15, aired on January 8. This was the first Americ{{an adaptation of}} Astrid Lindgren's character, {{not to mention the}} first adaptation done in color, and the first to feature a child actress playing Pippi—in this case, former Mousketeer Gina Gillespie. Gillespie also plays a girl named Susan Scholfield, who appears {{at the beginning and end}} of the story with her younger sister Betsy (played by Gina's sister Jennifer), both dreaming up the whole story after being sent to <b>bed</b> <b>early.</b> Although the story is mostly faithful to the original books, a few liberties are taken; Pippi is shown to be extremely intelligent (flawlessly answering a strict but well-meaning teacher's questions), which she attributes to her firsthand experiences in her world travels, and Pippi can fly (rather, she lands softly onto the ground from the rooftop of her house, à la Peter Pan). Among the characters, Pippi's originally nameless pet horse is named Horatio, and Thunder-Karlsson and Bloom are renamed [...] "Scar Face" [...] Seymour and [...] "Mad Dog" [...] Jerome. Also of note is Swedish wrestler/actor Tor Johnson, in one of his final roles, playing a circus strongman, the Mighty Adolf, whom Pippi challenges to a match of strength at the circus.|$|E
2500|$|Woolf {{wrote about}} meeting Sackville-West in 1925: [...] "Vita shines in the grocer's shop in Sevenoaks...pink growing, grape clustered, pearl hung...There is her {{maturity}} and full-breastedness; her being so much full in sail {{on the high}} tides, where I am coasting down backwaters; her capacity I mean to take the floor in any company, to represent her country, to visit Chatsworth, to control silver, servants, chow dogs, her motherhood...her in short being (what I have never been) a real woman". [...] Sackville-West greatly admired Woolf's writings, declaring in a 1925 letter: [...] "My darling, last night I went to <b>bed</b> <b>early</b> and read Mrs. Dalloway-It was a very curious sensation: I thought {{you were in the}} room...I was very unhappy because I had a row with my mother and very happy because of you; so it felt like being two different people at the same time...I felt quite light, as though I was falling through my bed, like when one has a high fever. Today I am quite solid again and my boots are quite muddy. They weigh me down. Yet I am not solid as usual-not quite an oaf-because there is {{at the back of my}} mind all the time...a glow, a sort of nebula, which only when I examine it hardens into a shape; as soon as I think of something else it dissolves again, remaining there like the sun through a fog and I have to reach out again, to take it into my hands & feel its contours: then it hardens, [...] "Virginia is coming on Saturday!". Sackville-West considered Woolf to be the better writer, telling Woolf in one letter: [...] "I contrast my illiterate writing with your scholarly one, and I am ashamed". Though Woolf envied Sackville-West's ability to quickly turn out books compared to her laborious efforts to turn out a novel, she was inclined to agree with this assessment, writing in her diary that A Passenger to Tehran was written too much in haste as [...] "Vita's prose is too fluent". Before going on her second trip to Persia in 1927, a chastened Sackville-West, after receiving several letters from Woolf telling her not to churn out books, wrote to Woolf: [...] "I shall work so hard , partly to please you and partly to please myself...I treasure your sudden discourse on literature yesterday morning, a send-off to me, rather like Polonius to Laertes. It is quite true that you have had infinitely more influence on me intellectually than anyone else, and for this alone, I love you...You do like me to write well, don't you? And I do hate writing badly-and having written so badly in the past. But now, like Queen Victoria, I will be good".|$|E
