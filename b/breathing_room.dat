Oklahoma quarterback Gene Calame rushed twice to gain some <b>breathing</b> <b>room</b> before the Sooners punted it away. Maryland took over on the Oklahoma 37-yard line. Quarterback Charlie Boxold {{completed}} a nine-yard pass to Dick Nolan. Halfback Chet Hanulak then connected with Nolan again.

Felton rushed from the one-yard line, but was stopped sixinches shy of the end zone, and Maryland turned over on downs. Maryland again drove inside the Oklahoma 10-yard line. Wilkinson sent in the alternate line-up and Oklahoma again stopped Maryland short. The Sooners fumbled at their own 20-yard line, but the Terrapins again failed to capitalize.|$|E
5|$|Penn State {{received}} the opening kickoff, however {{on their first}} play from scrimmage, Bill Belton lost a fumble and Minnesota recovered and kicked a field goal after failing to achieve a first down. Penn State's punt on the subsequent drive was downed at the four-yard line, but the poor field position did not adversely affect Minnesota, who drove down the field for a 15-play, 96-yard drive, highlighted by a 24-yard pass from Philip Nelson to Maxx Williams to convert a fourth down {{to get down to}} the Penn State four-yard line, from which point they scored two plays later via a 1-yard run by David Cobb. Penn State responded, however, with Zach Zwinak rushing the ball 5 times for 61 yards including a 38-yard run, and ultimately a 6-yard touchdown scamper. At the end of the first quarter, Minnesota led 10–7. In the second quarter, Minnesota wasted no time, embarking on a 13-play, 70-yard drive that lasted 6:54 and ended with Nelson rushing for a 6-yard touchdown. Penn State responded, driving down the field on 13 plays for 65 yards lasting 5:57, culminating with Ficken kicking a 27-yard field goal after the drive stalled in the red zone. Late in the half, Minnesota drove down the field, and Nelson completed a 24-yard touchdown pass to Williams, putting Minnesota on top 24–10 at the half. Receiving the second half kickoff, Minnesota initiated a drive that included a 39-yard run by Cobb, but ultimately ended in their first punt of the day, which they downed inside the one-yard line. Penn State achieved two first downs, but an illegal block in the back on Jesse James decimated the drive, which ended with a punt, but they caught a break a play later when Minnesota fumbled and Malcolm Willis recovered in Minnesota territory. The break did not materialize with any points, but their subsequent punt was downed inside the five yard line. Dreadful field position continued when, after driving for several yards, Minnesota's punt settled inside the five yard line, again setting Penn State up with a long field. In the waning moments of the third quarter, Penn State relied on Zwinak, who rushed several consecutive times to garner Penn State <b>breathing</b> <b>room.</b> There was no scoring in the third quarter. Penn State failed to convert a third down (they had still not converted any in the game), but Minnesota committed a roughing the kicker penalty, giving Penn State a second chance with which they converted their first third down of the game, but ultimately turned the ball over on downs. After a Minnesota punt, Penn State, for the first drive of the game, relied on their passing game to drive down the field, but, when faced with a fourth down and ten deep in Minnesota territory, failed to convert. On Minnesota's ensuing possession, however, they managed to run only 47 seconds off the clock, and went three-and-out. Hoping not to again blow an opportunity, Penn State moved promptly down the field, and got into the red zone. While there, a pass to Allen Robinson resulted in a pass interference penalty called against Minnesota, giving Penn State the ball at the two-yard line, from where they fumbled, and Minnesota recovered, and embarked on a possession from which they would not relinquish the ball, winning the game 24–10, after no scoring in the second half.|$|E

40|$|Background: Diffusion hypoxia is {{the most}} serious {{potential}} complication associated with nitrous oxide. It occurs during the recovery period. Hence, administration of 100 % oxygen is mandatory as suggested by many authors. Aim: The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the occurrence/nonoccurrence of diffusion hypoxia in two groups of patients undergoing routine dental treatment under nitrous oxide sedation when one group is subjected to 7 min of postsedation oxygenation and the second group of the patients is made to <b>breathe</b> <b>room</b> air for the similar period. Materials and Methods: A total of sixty patients within the age group of 7 – 10 years requiring invasive dental procedures were randomly divided into two groups of 30 each using chit method. In the control group, patients were administered 100 % oxygen postsedation, whereas, in the study group, patients were made to <b>breathe</b> <b>room</b> air postsedation. Various parameters (pulse rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation [SpO 2]) were recorded pre- and post-operatively. Data were collected and then sent for statistical analysis. Results: The mean postoperative SpO 2 at measurement times 1, 3, 5, and 7 min in both the groups was higher than the mean preoperative SpO 2. This increase was statistically significant.

40|$|Abstract. A {{technique}} is described {{for studying the}} distribution of {{blood flow to the}} maternal and fetal placental vessels in sheep and dogs with radioactive labeled macroaggregates of albumin. When the maternal animal <b>breathed</b> <b>room</b> air the distribution of maternal placental blood flow was uneven among the cotyledons as well as within a given cotyledon. Fetal blood flow was also distributed nonuniformly among and within the cotyledons. The relation of maternal to fetal placental blood flow was also markedly uneven (coefficient of correlation, r = 0. 066). After the animal was made hypoxic by breathing 10 - 12 % ° 2 the distribution of maternal, fetal, and maternal/fetal placental flows became more uniform. The coefficient of correlation of maternal to fetal flow was high (r = 0. 53, P < 0. 01). While the maternal animal <b>breathed</b> <b>room</b> air, after ligation of a major branch of the umbilical artery the distribution of maternal, fetal, and ma-ternal/fetal flows in the remaining two-thirds to three-fourths of the placenta became more uniform. The correlation coefficient for maternal to fetal flow was high (r = 0. 35, P < 0. 01). It appears that under normal circumstances with uneven distribution of blood flows there is a considerable portion of the placenta that does not re-ceive blood flow in optimum quantities to promote efficient ° 2 exchange. Failure to consider the influence of nonuniform maternal flow/fetal flow will result in overestimation of mean maternal-fetal oxygen tension gradients, and thus underestimation of the placental diffusing capacity for oxygen. In response to maternal hypoxia or compromise of the fetal placental circu-lation the distribution of maternal, fetal, and maternal/fetal flows becomes more uniform, thereby increasing the efficiency of placental 02 exchange...|$|R
