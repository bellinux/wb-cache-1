[...] He later included the movie in his Great Movies collection, comparing the movie favorably to Jarmusch's later efforts like Dead Man and The Limits of Control. In an April 2000 retrospective of Jarmusch's work for Sight & Sound, Shawn Levy concluded that the film was [...] "as much a valentine to the allure of the American way of pop culture as it is a cheeky bit of structural legerdemain without terribly much resonating significance".|$|E

Highly recommended." [...] In her review dated 3 October, and printed in the same newspaper, Allison Pearson was comically critical of certain design aspects, such as the surface of Mars, the exterior of the Mysteron city and the London Car-Vu model (described as a [...] "Philippe Starck cake-stand"). However, she also referred to the episode as being part of a [...] "classic Sixties puppet show." ...|$|E
