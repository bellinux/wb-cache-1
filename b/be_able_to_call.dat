5|$|The Buccaneers scored {{their first}} points, {{but were not}} able to score enough to win, despite {{statistically}} outperforming the Buffalo Bills in most phases of the game. The Buccaneers had only three Dave Green field goals to show for seven possessions inside the Bills’ 22-yard line. O.J. Simpson, who would rush for a season total of 1,503 yards, was held to only 39 yards on twenty carries. The Bills, the highest-scoring team in recent years, were 1 of 12 in third-down conversions, and were surpassed in yardage, first downs, rushing average, and number of total plays. Buffalo took the lead on Bob Chandler’s 58-yard reception of a tipped pass. The Buccaneers’ 338 yards of offense, a great improvement over their previous two games, coincided with coach McKay’s relenting to Steve Spurrier’s demands that he <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> his own plays. Spurrier suffered a bone chip in his throwing hand that made his status questionable for the next week’s game.|$|E

Selection favors the most efficient call production, a good quality call that does not require {{high levels of}} energy. allowing a male frog to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> continuously for females. Dendropsophus microcephalus, a small tree frog, will produce 100 notes per minute for several hours, requiring up to 25 times more oxygen. Some frogs produce less energetic calls and remain in chorus {{for longer periods of}} time with the ability to remain active longer being better for mating success than a higher energy vocal display.|$|E
500|$|Miyazaki forgoes {{traditional}} screenplays in his productions, instead {{developing the}} film's narrative as he designs the storyboards. [...] "We {{never know where}} the story will go but we just keep working on the film as it develops," [...] he said. In each of his films, Miyazaki has employed traditional animation methods, drawing each frame by hand; computer-generated imagery has been employed in several of his later films, beginning with Princess Mononoke, to [...] "enrich the visual look", though he ensures that each film can [...] "retain the right ratio between working by hand and computer ... and still <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> my films 2D".

500|$|Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{has been}} {{assigned}} {{to set up the}} Halloween party by Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who wants {{to live up to the}} expectations set by Robert California (James Spader). Robert arrives with his son Bert (David Mazouz) and remarks that the party is more tailored to kids than adults. In response, Andy asks Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) to take over and re-tailor the party, much to Erin's chagrin. Andy also tells her that he wishes to speak with her at the end of the day. Worried that he intends to fire her, she asks Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) to help her make the party more [...] "scary" [...] and [...] "sexy", and he gives her a tape to show everyone. Gabe explains to the camera crew that the video is a Cinema of the Unsettling movie, an avant garde film genre defined by its disturbing images and absence of plot. Disgusted by the video, the office staff demand an explanation from Erin. In desperation, she shows them her idea for making the party more [...] "sexy": a card game with photos of genitalia. This only makes them more outraged, and Andy and Robert talk with Erin in his office regarding the incident. Erin admits her fears about their planned talk at the end of the day. Andy tells her what he wanted to talk to her about: he has reached a point in his romantic relationship where his girlfriend should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> him at the office, and that he wanted to clear this with Erin first since she handles all calls. Erin had not even known that he was dating someone, and is shocked to hear they have been out on 31 dates so far. Erin feels dejected and leaves.|$|E

There she concludes that the problem of our reliance on images and especially photographic images is not that [...] "people remember through photographs but that they remember only the photographs ... that the photographic image eclipses other forms of understanding – and remembering. ... To remember is, more and more, not to recall a story but to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> up a picture" [...] (p.94).|$|E

He also envisioned a [...] "personal transceiver, so small and compact that every man carries one." [...] He wrote: [...] "the time will come when we will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> a person anywhere on Earth merely by dialling a number." [...] Such a device would also, in Clarke's vision, include means for global positioning so that [...] "no one need ever again be lost." [...] Later, in Profiles of the Future, he predicted the advent of such a device {{taking place in the}} mid-1980s.|$|E

Brearley was captain during the infamous aluminium bat incident in 1979, when he objected to Dennis Lillee's use of the bat, instead of one made of willow. On the same tour he caused controversy by ordering all his fielders including the wicketkeeper to the boundary with three runs required off the last ball of the match (this was legal {{by the rules of}} the time).|$|E

In addition one platoon was positioned in a location from where they could provide support by fire on to the company-sized position in order to distract them during the initial assault. By noon the battle preparation had been completed and Maunsell led his two assault platoons in single file up the ridge towards the summit. An advance party, consisting of 16 men {{under the command of}} Lance Corporal Rambahadur Limbu, led the way, crawling silently up the steep ridge and clearing the way {{for the rest of the}} company.

2500|$|Yasht 13 {{begins with}} a cosmogonical chapter in which the Creator Ahura Mazda is portrayed as acknowleding that {{material}} creation was brought about {{with the assistance of}} [...] "many hundreds, many thousands, many tens of thousands" [...] of [...] "mighty, victorious fravashis" [...] (13.1-2). Moreover, Mazda is presented as acknowledging that without the help of the fravashis, cattle and men would have been lost to Angra Mainyu. [...] "This declaration is wholly unorthodox, and unsupported by any other text." [...] Verses 14-15, as also several other verses scattered through the text, describe how the fravashis continue to sustain the material world and mankind in the post-creation phase of the world. Verses 16-17, as also several other later verses, celebrate their military prowess and assistance in battle, where they are invoked. Verse 20 includes an injunction to memorize their invocation, so as to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> on them in times of need.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{multiplayer}} mode is {{an extension}} of the Mother Base base-building feature. Players are able to expand their operations to include [...] "Forward Operating Bases" [...] which can be used to generate resources and income for the single-player campaign. These facilities can be attacked by other players, making a player-versus-player mode available whereby the attacking team attempts to steal resources and/or soldiers and the defending team tries to protect the Forward Operating Base from the intruder. Defenders will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> on their friends to aid in the defence, especially if their Forward Operating Base is attacked during a story mission. Players are able to customize the security, staffing and layout of their Forward Operating Bases, allowing for a large number of compound configurations. Following {{the success or failure of}} the intrusion, the location of the attacking player's Forward Operating Base is revealed to the defending player; however, defending players can only launch a retaliatory strike if the attacker was discovered during their infiltration. The Forward Operating Base feature is intended to be an entirely separate multiplayer experience to Metal Gear Online, and is also needed to increase the number of combat units the player can deploy.|$|E

2500|$|The Chancellorsville Campaign {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{lopsided}} clashes of the war, with the Union's effective fighting force more than twice the Confederates', the greatest imbalance during the war in Virginia. Hooker's army was much better supplied and was well-rested after several months of inactivity. Lee's forces, on the other hand, were poorly provisioned and were scattered all over the state of Virginia. Some 15,000 men of Longstreet's Corps had previously been detached and stationed near Norfolk in order to block a potential threat to Richmond from Federal troops stationed at Fort Monroe and Newport News on the Peninsula, as well as at Norfolk and Suffolk. In light of the continued Federal inactivity, by late March Longstreet's primary assignment became that of requisitioning provisions for Lee's forces from the farmers and planters of North Carolina and Virginia. As a result of this the two divisions of Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood and Maj. Gen. [...] George Pickett were [...] away from Lee's army and would take a week or more of marching to reach it in an emergency. After nearly a year of campaigning, allowing these troops to slip away from his immediate control was Lee's gravest miscalculation.
