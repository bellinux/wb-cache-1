5|$|Realizing his situation, Maroboduus {{requested}} Roman aid. It had <b>been</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> {{since the}} Marcommani refused to help Roman against {{the forces of}} Arminius, and so Tiberius refused to send aid. Instead, Tiberius sent Drusus to further Roman interests at Maroboduus' expense as he knew the Marcomanni were vulnerable. During the summer of 18, Drusus received intelligence from a former captive of Maroboduus, Catualda, that Maroboduus was weak and {{that it was a good}} time to attack. Hence, Drusus led a powerful force into the heart of the Marcomanni, and stormed their royal stronghold. Maroboduus fled, but was forced to seek asylum in Rome, which Tiberius granted. Later, Catualda lost a battle against the Hermunduri, and he too was granted asylum. The Senate decreed that Drusus be given an ovation for his success, which he received on his return to Rome on 28 May 20.|$|E

She plotted to kidnap Allegra from the convent and asked Shelley to forge a letter of {{permission}} from Byron. Shelley refused her request. Byron's seemingly callous treatment of the child was further vilified when Allegra died there at age five from a fever some scholars identify as typhus and others speculate was a malarial-type fever. Clairmont held Byron entirely responsible {{for the loss of}} their daughter and hated him {{for the rest of her}} life. Shelley's death followed only two months later.|$|E
25|$|The Continental Army was {{put through}} a new {{training}} program, supervised by Baron von Steuben, introducing the most modern Prussian methods of drilling. Meanwhile, Howe resigned, {{and was replaced by}} Henry Clinton on May 24, 1778. Clinton received orders to abandon Philadelphia and fortify New York following France's entry into the war. On June 18, the British departed Philadelphia, with the reinvigorated Americans in pursuit. The two armies fought at Monmouth Court House on June 28, with the Americans holding the field, greatly boosting morale and confidence. By July, both armies were back in the same positions they had <b>been</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> prior.|$|E
25|$|Outside the stadium, a {{bottleneck}} {{developed with}} more fans arriving {{than could be}} safely filtered through the turnstiles before 3:00pm.

25|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, however, the {{cultural}} climate had completely changed, as {{the growth in}} SCP interest had taken place against a shifting economic and cultural scene (136). First, {{the price of oil}} rose catastrophically in 1974, so that its cost per barrel was five times greater than it had <b>been</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> earlier. Second, despite continuing hunger around the world, anticipated demand also began to shift from humans to animals. The program had begun with the vision of growing food for Third World people, yet the product was instead launched as an animal food for the developed world. The rapidly rising demand for animal feed made that market appear economically more attractive. The ultimate downfall of the SCP project, however, came from public resistance.|$|E
500|$|In 1870, Stone and Blackwell {{founded the}} Woman's Journal, an eight-page weekly {{newspaper}} based in Boston. [...] Originally intended primarily to voice {{the concerns of}} the NEWSA and the AWSA, by the 1880s it had become an unofficial voice of the suffrage movement as a whole. Stone edited the journal {{for the rest of her}} life, assisted by her husband and their daughter Alice Stone Blackwell. [...] Stone did not collect a salary for her work on the paper, which required continual financial support. [...] One of her greatest challenges was raising money to keep it going. [...] Its circulation reached a peak of 6,000, although in 1878 it was 2,000 less than it had <b>been</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> earlier.|$|E
500|$|During {{the course}} of the battle, the Australians lost 10 killed and 25 wounded, while 34 Japanese bodies were found on the position, with several more lying in irretrievable {{positions}} down the steep slopes. In addition one Japanese soldier was taken prisoner. According to the Australian official historian, Gavin Long, the attack on Pearl Ridge was a significant gain for the Australians, not only strategically but morally. Having been put in against a force of roughly equal size, [...] consisting of troops who were significantly more experienced than the Australians, whose only previous combat experience had <b>been</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> earlier during the Battle of Milne Bay, Long argues that the battle highlighted the effectiveness of the training the 25th Infantry Battalion had undertaken prior to deploying to Bougainville. James also supports this view, stating that McKinna's skilled leadership and aggressive nature had also been a strong factor. Meanwhile, for the Japanese, the loss of Pearl Ridge damaged the prestige of the 38th Mixed Independent Brigade, with Japanese commanders ascribing the loss to poor support from their artillery and mortars. James attributes this to the limited infrastructure in the area, and the lack of defensive construction or development undertaken following the Japanese capture of the island in 1942.|$|E

500|$|O'Dea {{signed with}} Major League Soccer club Toronto FC on 3 August 2012, {{and made his}} club debut on 18 August in a 1–0 home loss to Sporting Kansas City. According to CBC News, he looked [...] "lively" [...] in his first match with the team. In a match against Houston Dynamo he passed to Terry Dunfield, who scored, {{and at the end}} of the game said he was [...] "delighted" [...] with the result. Manager Paul Mariner named O'Dea team captain in September, {{succeeding}} the injured Torsten Frings. The following month, he was unable to play a match against Montreal Impact due to a thigh injury sustained during World Cup qualifying play for Ireland. In O'Dea's first season for Toronto, he played nine times as Toronto finished tenth in the Eastern Conference. O'Dea was employed at left back for the 2013 season after the regular player at that position was injured. According to him, it had <b>been</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> since he had previously played left back. O'Dea scored his first goal for Toronto on 3 July 2013 in a 3–3 home draw with Canadian rivals Montreal Impact. Because of his [...] "keen sense of positioning and timing" [...] against Sporting Kansas City, he was named to the Team of the Week for 12 March. Originally part of a transfer (a [...] "win-win for both parties", according to head coach Ryan Nelsen, since O'Dea was the highest-paid player in the league), he was released by Toronto on 18 July 2013 to sign with FC Metalurh Donetsk. Club president Kevin Payne wished him luck and hoped he would return in the future. O'Dea played a total of 26 times for Toronto, scoring one goal and setting up three, and was succeeded as team captain by Steven Caldwell.|$|E

2500|$|By late 1710, John and Maria Anna had not {{produced}} an {{heir to the}} throne. It had <b>been</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> since the couple had been married, and the court was starting to question {{the future of the}} House of Braganza. In early 1711, the king met with Franciscan Cardinal Nuno da Cunha e Ataíde, High Inquisitor of the Portuguese Inquisition, who told him that if he promised God to build a Franciscan convent in Mafra, God would deliver his long desired heir. Accordingly, John promised that if Maria Anna became pregnant before the end of 1711, he would build a Franciscan convent in Mafra. [...] John's wish would come true later that year, when Maria Anna fulfilled her duty as queen [...] and gave birth to the Infanta Maria Barbara of Braganza on 4 December 1711.|$|E
2500|$|Andrews {{was forced}} to quit the show {{towards the end of}} the Broadway run in 1997 when she {{developed}} hoarseness in her voice. She subsequently underwent surgery at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital to remove non-cancerous nodules from her throat. (However, Andrews has recently stated that it was due to [...] "a certain kind of muscular striation [...] happens on the vocal cords" [...] as a result of strain from Victor/Victoria, adding [...] "I didn't have cancer, I didn't have nodules, I didn't have anything.") She emerged from the surgery with permanent damage that destroyed the purity of her singing and gave a rasp to her speaking voice. In 1999 she filed a malpractice suit against the doctors at Mount Sinai Hospital, including Scott Kessler and Jeffrey Libin, who had operated on her throat. Originally, the doctors assured Andrews that she should regain her voice within six weeks, but Andrews' stepdaughter Jennifer Edwards said in 1999 [...] "it's <b>been</b> <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> and it [...] still hasn't returned." [...] The lawsuit was settled in September 2000 for an undisclosed amount.|$|E
2500|$|The Vatican {{was placed}} in a dilemma by this turn of events. If Yohannan's {{profession}} of faith was genuine, he might be the Catholic patriarch of Babylon the Vatican had long been hoping for, and his confirmation would be rapidly followed by the adoption of Catholicism by all the villages of the Mosul patriarchate. On the other hand, to confirm Yohannan's election would be to condone the distasteful practice of hereditary succession. [...] There was also the possibility that Yohannan's submission was no more sincere than Ishoyahb's had <b>been</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> earlier. [...] The Vatican's initial response was therefore to inform Raphael Terconuski, the superior of the Catholic mission at Mosul, that Yohannan Hormizd's profession of faith appeared to be satisfactory, but that his election was to be considered null. On 18 February 1783, having considered further, the Sacred Congregation decided to appoint Yohannan archbishop of Mosul and administrator of the patriarchate of Babylon, granting him all the necessary powers to that end except the title and the insignia of the patriarch.|$|E

2500|$|Warnings {{of famine}} began in March 1974 {{when the price}} of rice rose sharply. In this month [...] "widespread {{starvation}} started in Rangpur district", the region which would become one of three most afflicted. It had only <b>been</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> and three months {{since the end of the}} war for Bangladeshi independence (December 1971) and the country's formal creation. In many ways, Bangladesh's new state and devastated infrastructure and markets were wholly unprepared to deal with the situation. Corruption among the newly appointed officials was rampant and widespread. In April, though government officials reiterated that the crisis would be temporary, rice prices continued to rise sharply and reports of starvation became more widespread. From April to July, Bangladesh was hit by heavy rainfall and a series of devastating floods along the Brahmaputra river, with notably destructive incidents in May, July; the ability of the rice crops to survive this was reduced by the growing monoculture of HYV rice. In addition, neighbouring India declined to co-operate with the government of Bangladesh. Rice crops were devastated and prices rocketed. In October rice prices peaked and conditions eased by November 1974 as foreign aid and the winter crop arrived. The famine was officially over by December, though [...] "excess" [...] mortality (e.g. by disease) continued well into the following year, as is the case with most famines. More people suffered in the rural areas due to starvation. Generally, regional famine intensity was correlated to flood exposure and no doubt the floods exacerbated the famine. However, though warnings of famine began long before the flood (as demonstrated above), it is to the floods which the famine is popularly blamed.|$|E
