40|$|Individuals. {{thinking}} styles play {{central role in}} their decision making process. Epstein, Pacini, Denes Raj, and Heier, (1996) and Pacini and Epstein (1999) described two major types of thinking patterns i. e. rational and experiential. Prior research investigated different factors that affect {{thinking styles}} of people. These factors range from inherited instincts to environmental pressures. The current study aimed to {{examine the impact of}} religious affiliations of secondary school students on their rational thinking. Profound review of related literature leaded the researcher to adapt age-universal I-E scale developed by Allport and Ross (1967) and revised by Kirkpatrick, Moberg, and Lynn (1988) and rational experiential inventory for adolescents (REI-A) developed by Pacini and Epstein (1999) and revised by Marks, Hine, Blore, and Phillips (2008). The age universal I-E scale measures three dimensions of religiousness i. e. intrinsic, extrinsic personal and extrinsic social religiosity of the individuals of all ages. The REI-A is to scale rational and experiential thinking of adolescents. The 3517 secondary school students having religious affiliations with Hinduism (1050), Christianity (1073) and Islam (1394) were included in the sample using non random sampling techniques. It was ensured that only the students studying government prepared syllabus were selected in the samples. The adapted instruments were translated into Urdu and validated through the opinions of ten field experts. All five subscales demonstrated high reliability of the data of Pakistani samples. Collected data were entered in SPSS files. The negative statements were recoded and results were presented in graphs and tables. Results of skewness, Kurtosis, Kaiser Meyer Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy and <b>Bartlett.</b> <b>s</b> <b>test</b> of sphericity supported the normality of sample distribution and homogeneity of data. Principal component analysis, rotated component matrix and structural equation models endorsed the structures of scales and subscales. Statistical analysis of the data was done using t test, ANOVA, correlation coefficients and regression analysis. Findings revealed that Muslim secondary school students were comparatively more intrinsically religious and rational in thinking than their Hindu and Christian fellows. In contrast the Christian students were comparatively more extrinsic personal and extrinsic social religious than their Hindu and Muslim secondary school fellows. Similarly, the Christian students were more experiential in thinking than their fellows. Major contribution {{of the study was to}} trace out the relationship between religious orientations and thinking patterns of the students. It was concluded that rational thinking of Hindu, Christian and Muslim secondary school students (separately and collectively) was directly associated with their intrinsic and extrinsic personal religiousness and indirectly correlated with their extrinsic social religiosity. The three aspects of religious orientations moderately explained the variances in rational thinking of the Hindu and Muslim secondary school students whereas for the Christian students this share was significantly small. The study proposed further research in the field to investigate the factors (social, cultural, political, financial etc.) that played role in forming religious orientations of the students having different faith. The study also suggests further investigation of factors that transform students thinking styles with the passage of time...|$|E
50|$|Durham's {{location}} {{is a result}} of the needs of the 19th century railroad industry. The wood-burning steam locomotives of the time had to stop frequently for wood and water and the new North Carolina Railroad needed a depot between the settled towns of Raleigh and Hillsborough. The residents of what is now downtown Durham thought their businesses catering to livestock drivers had a better future than a new-fangled nonsense like a railroad and refused to sell or lease land for a depot. Eventually a railway depot was established on land donated by <b>Bartlett</b> <b>S.</b> Durham in 1849.|$|R

Methods We searched a range of bibliographic and ‘grey’ literature databases to identify studies that had processed domestic water samples using both the H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> and recognized tests for thermotolerant coliforms or Escherichia coli. We screened 661 study abstracts and identified 51 relevant studies based on 13 853 water samples. For each relevant study, we recorded the level of correspondence between the H 2 <b>S</b> and recognized <b>tests,</b> microbial testing procedures, details of the samples processed and study quality indicators. We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the impact of testing procedures, study quality and sample characteristics on the diagnostic accuracy of the H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test.</b> Results H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> implementation varied between studies, and the test’s diagnostic accuracy varied significantly and substantially between studies. Little of this variation was explained by testing procedures, study quality or the nature of the samples processed.

40|$|Aims: The {{object of}} this study was to assess the {{usefulness}} of the H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> for detection of fecal pollution of water in comparison to fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). Materials and Methods: A total of 70 raw water samples were collected from drinking water sources in Isfahan province of Iran, aseptically in sterile containers during May-October 2012. The modified H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> medium of Manja et al. was used except that L-cysteine was added as an additional medium component. Total coliforms (TCs), fecal coliforms (FCs), and fecal streptococci (FS) were also estimated by multiple-tube fermentation method. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 20 at the 95 % conﬁdence level (α = 0. 05). Results: It was found that out of 70 water samples assessed, 48. 3 %, 30. 0 %, 34. 6 %, and 32. 9 % of the samples were positive for TCs, FCs, FS, and H 2 S, respectively. Analysis of data showed that 95. 6 %, 69. 5 %, and 76. 9 % of water samples, which were positive for H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> were also positive for TCs, FCs, and FS, respectively.

40|$|Results of {{previous}} studies have not indicated clearly which tests {{should be used to}} assess short-term efforts of people with intellectual disabilities. Thus, the aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate laboratory and field-based tests of short-term effort with maximal intensity of subjects with intellectual disabilities. Twenty four people with intellectual disability, who trained soccer, participated in this study. The 30 <b>s</b> Wingate <b>test</b> and additionally an 8 <b>s</b> <b>test</b> with maximum intensity were performed on a bicycle ergometer. The fatigue index, maximal and mean power, relative maximal and relative mean power were measured. Overall, nine field-based tests were conducted: 5, 10 and 20 m sprints, a 20 m shuttle run, a seated medicine ball throw, a bent arm hang test, a standing broad jump, sit-ups and a hand grip test. The reliability of the 30 s and 8 <b>s</b> Wingate <b>tests</b> for subjects with intellectual disability was confirmed. Significant correlation was observed for mean power between the 30 s and 8 <b>s</b> <b>tests</b> on the bicycle ergometer at a moderate level (r > 0. 4).

(8) The changes in total protein and gamma globulin levels were most closely related to vitamin B_ 1 deficiency. (9) Of all the tests for liver function, Takada 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>test</b> produced sesults which corresponded most closely to vitamin B_ 1 deficiency in total protein and gamma globulin levels. Significant difference in albumin fraction level and the ratio albumin/globulin between liver function disturbance and vitamin B_ 1 deficiency was found in the results of Takada 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>test</b> alone,. The group consisting of cases positive for Takada 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>test</b> showed a rise in gamma globulin level, while the group consisting of cases of vitamin B_ 1 de ficiency showed a lowering in gamma globulin level. Vitamin B_ 1 {{plays an important role in}} the metabolism of carbohydrates. Birbic acid is formed as an intermediary product of the metabolism of sugar and is converted into acetaldehyd and carbon dioxideby the catalyzing action of co-carboxylase. The disturbance in liver function is often noticed in cases of disorder of the metabolism of birbic acid as well as of vitamin B_ 1 deficiency. The author carried out experiments in about 100 each of normal and tubercular persons to see if there are any relations between the metabolism of vitamin B_ 1, the metabolism of birbic acid and the liver function. The statistical analysis of the results is givenbelow: (1) There was correlation between vitamin B_ 1 deficiency and the disturbance in liver function revealed as the results of BSP test, Takada 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>test</b> and the tests for urobilin and urobilinogen in the urine. There was closer relation between vitamin B_ 1 deficiency and the disturbance in excretory function as revealed by Takada 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>test</b> and the tests for urobilin and urobilinogen in the urine, than between _vitamin B_ 1 deficiency and the disturbance in metabolic function as revealed by BSP test. (2) There was correlation between the results of Sawada 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> urinary <b>test</b> and the disturbance in liver function. The association of the latter with the former was found to be the highest in the results of the test for urobilinogen in the urine, followed by those of Takada 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>test,</b> the test for urobilin in urine and B <b>S</b> P <b>test</b> in the indicated order.
