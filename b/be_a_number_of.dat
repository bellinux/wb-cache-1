There may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Assistant Pack Scouters, with nicknames from other Jungle Book characters. The Cub Advancement Programme is based on Cubs working towards the Silver Wolf and Gold Wolf badges, each divided into four Challenge Awards: Aptitude, Awareness, Outdoor, and Community; and the Leaping Wolf badge.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this work}} we propose an {{approach}} to prioritizing order of transmission of sensed data in wireless sensor network that are very popular in, for example, environmental monitoring. The approach is based on determination of a consensus relation which is in "nearest distance " from all initial rankings shaped by multiple sensors of each network node. Statistically and probabilistically based analytical models useful for assuring network performance and providing reasonable number values n – k and m are proposed and discussed, where n – k <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> packets transmitted to the sink; n <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the network sensor nodes; k <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> dropped packets due to a congestion; and m <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> node sensors (or rankings) ...|$|R

25|$|Cathedrals of monastic foundation, {{and some}} of secular clergy have cloisters which {{traditionally}} provided an open area where secular activities took place protected from wind and rain. Some cathedrals also have a chapter house where the chapter could meet. In England, where these buildings have survived, they are often octagonal. A cathedral may front onto the main square of a town, as in Florence, {{or it may be}} set in a walled close as at Canterbury. There may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> associated monastic or clergy buildings, a bishop's palace and often a school to educate the choristers.|$|E
25|$|There may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> {{side effects}} {{following}} the surgery. Because certain nerve {{connections to the}} lungs are cut during the procedure, transplant recipients cannot feel the urge to cough or feel when their new lungs are becoming congested. They must therefore make conscious efforts to take deep breaths and cough in order to clear secretions from the lungs. Their heart rate responds less quickly to exertion due to the cutting of the vagus nerve that would normally help regulate it. They may also notice a change in their voice due to potential damage to the nerves that coordinate the vocal cords.|$|E
25|$|The mate {{deprivation}} hypothesis {{alludes to}} the concept that the threshold for rape is lowered in males that lack alternative reproductive options. This idea {{is supported by the}} fact that rape is disproportionately committed by men with a lower socioeconomic status. However, Malamuth found a relationship between low socioeconomic status and a rearing environment in which social relationships were not committed, which in turn resulted in a male’s reduced ability to form enduring relationships in later life. This subsequently results in less alternative reproductive options. Therefore, while there is indeed a relationship between a lack of alternative reproductive options and rape behaviour, there are likely to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> co-morbid factors affecting this correlation, leading Thornhill and Palmer to conclude that the idea of a specific psychological adaptation that motivated men with a lack of sexual access to females is unlikely, and that further research need be conducted.|$|E

500|$|The {{technique}} and clothing of Roman charioteers differed significantly from {{those used by}} the Greeks. Roman drivers wrapped the reins round their waist, while the Greeks held the reins in their hands. Because of this, the Romans could not {{let go of the}} reins in a crash, so they would be dragged around the circus until they were killed or they freed themselves. In order to cut the reins and keep from being dragged in case of accident, they carried a falx, a curved knife. They also wore helmets and other protective gear. In any given race, there might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> teams put up by each faction, who would cooperate to maximize their chances of victory by ganging up on opponents, forcing them out of the preferred inside track or making them lose concentration and [...] expose themselves to accident and injury. Spectators could also play a part as there is evidence they threw lead [...] "curse" [...] amulets studded with nails at teams opposing their favourite.|$|E
