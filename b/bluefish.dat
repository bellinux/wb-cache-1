5|$|Old Crow Flats and <b>Bluefish</b> Caves {{are some}} of the {{earliest}} known sites of human habitation in Canada. The Paleo-Indian Clovis, Plano and Pre-Dorset cultures pre-date current indigenous peoples of the Americas. Projectile point tools, spears, pottery, bangles, chisels and scrapers mark archaeological sites, thus distinguishing cultural periods, traditions and lithic reduction styles.|$|E
5|$|In 1834, Weston {{established}} a large shipyard on the <b>Bluefish</b> River in Duxbury {{known as the}} Ten Acre Yard. The largest vessels of the Weston fleet were built there, and it had the capacity for the simultaneous construction of two vessels. When Samuel Hall left Weston's employment, a local master carpenter named Samuel Cushing took over as superintendent of the Ten Acre Yard and built vessels there until the yard ceased operation in 1843.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, at the beach, Brody sees a {{dark shadow}} that approaches the swimmers. Thinking it is a shark, he frantically orders everyone {{out of the}} water, and causes a panic by firing his gun. However, the shadow is revealed to be a school of <b>bluefish.</b> His fears are confirmed when he acquires a close-up picture of the shark from the diver's camera. The Amity town council, including local developer Len Peterson, deny the evidence and fire Brody.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Beringian wolf, other Beringian carnivores include the Beringian cave lion (Panthera leo spelaea), scimitar-toothed cat (Homotherium serum), short-faced bear (Arctodus simus), and the omnivorous brown bear (Ursus arctos). Beringian wolves would have faced competition for the carcasses of large herbivores from the formidable short-faced bear, a scavenger. Additionally, humans had reached the <b>Bluefish</b> Caves in the Yukon Territory by 24,000YBP, with cutmarks being found there on specimens of Yukon horse, steppe bison, caribou, wapiti (Cervus elaphus), and Dall sheep (Ovis dalli).|$|E
5|$|The Old Crow Flats and basin {{was one of}} {{the areas}} in Canada {{untouched}} by glaciations during the Pleistocene Ice ages, thus it served as a pathway and refuge for ice age plants and animals. The area holds evidence of early human habitation in Canada dating from about 12,000. Fossils from the area include some never accounted for in North America, such as hyenas and large camels. <b>Bluefish</b> Caves is an archaeological site in Yukon, Canada from which a specimen of apparently human-worked mammoth bone has been radiocarbon dated to 12,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|The first {{inhabitants}} of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia {{by way of}} the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago, though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival. The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and <b>Bluefish</b> Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada. The characteristics of Canadian indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks. Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations.|$|E
5|$|Most terns hunt fish by diving, often {{hovering}} first, and {{the particular}} approach technique used can help to distinguish similar species at a distance. Sea terns often hunt in association with porpoises or predatory fish, such as <b>bluefish,</b> tuna or bonitos, since these large marine animals drive the prey to the surface. Sooty terns feed at night as the fish rise to the surface, and are believed {{to sleep on the}} wing since they become waterlogged easily. Terns of several species will feed on invertebrates, following the plough or hunting on foot on mudflats. The marsh terns normally catch insects in the air or pick them off the surface of fresh water. Other species will sometimes use these techniques if the opportunity arises. An individual tern's foraging efficiency increases with its age.|$|E
5|$|Some 97% of {{the common}} thresher's diet is {{composed}} of bony fishes, mostly small schooling forage fish such as mackerel, <b>bluefish,</b> herring, needlefish, and lanternfish. Before striking, the sharks compact schools of prey by swimming around them and splashing the water with its tail, often in pairs or small groups. Threshers are also known to take large, solitary fishes such as lancetfish, as well as squid and other pelagic invertebrates. Off California, common threshers feed mostly on the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), with Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus), market squid (Loligo opalescens), and pelagic red crab (Pleuroncodes planipes) also being important food items. The sharks concentrate on a few prey species during cold water years, but become less discriminating during less productive, warmer El Niño periods.|$|E
5|$|Schirra {{was awakened}} at 1:40 am ET {{on the morning}} of October 3, and after a hearty breakfast—including a <b>bluefish</b> he had speared the day before—and a brief {{physical}} he left for the launchpad at around 4 am. He entered the spacecraft at 4:41 am ET, where he found a steak sandwich left for him in the 'glove compartment', and began the pre-launch checks. The launch countdown proceeded as planned until 6:15, when there was a 15-minute hold to allow the Canary Islands tracking station to repair a radar set. The countdown resumed at 6:30 and proceeded to booster ignition with no further delays. Liftoff proceeded smoothly, but there was a momentary clockwise roll transient at liftoff, which reached 7.83° per second and approached 80% of the required threshold to trigger the ASIS abort system. This was later identified as being due to a slight misalignment of the main engines and was kept under control by the booster's vernier thrusters. Sustainer engine thrust during the launch was slightly below normal and fuel consumption higher than normal due to a suspected leak in the sustainer fuel system.|$|E
5|$|Spinner sharks feed {{primarily}} on small bony fish, including tenpounders, sardines, herring, anchovies, sea catfish, lizardfish, mullets, <b>bluefish,</b> tunas, bonito, croakers, jacks, mojarras, and tongue-soles. They {{have also been}} known to eat stingrays, cuttlefish, squid, and octopus. Groups of spinner sharks are often found pursuing schools of prey at high speed. Individual prey are seized and swallowed whole, as this shark lacks cutting dentition. This species employs an unusual tactic when feeding on schools of small fish; the shark charges vertically through the school, spinning on its axis with its mouth open and snapping all around it. The shark's momentum {{at the end of}} these spiraling runs often carries it into the air, giving it its common name. The blacktip shark also performs this behavior, though not as often. Off Madagascar, spinner sharks follow migrating schools of mackerel, tunas, and jacks. Like blacktip sharks, they congregate around shrimp trawlers to feed on the discarded bycatch, and may be incited into feeding frenzies.|$|E
25|$|Cape Cod {{is known}} {{around the world}} as a spring-to-fall {{destination}} for sport anglers. Among the species most widely pursued are striped bass, <b>bluefish,</b> bluefin tuna, false albacore (little tunny), bonito, tautog, flounder and fluke. The Cape Cod Bay side of the Cape, from Sandwich to Provincetown, has numerous harbors, saltwater creeks, and shoals that hold bait fish and attract the larger game fish, such as striped bass, <b>bluefish</b> and bluefin tuna.|$|E
25|$|Striped bass has {{firm and}} flavorful flesh {{with a large}} flake. The hybrid striped bass yields more meat, has a more fragile texture, and a blander flavor than wild striped bass. The fish has a mild and {{distinctive}} flavor. In recipes, it can be substituted for milder fish like cod, {{as well as for}} stronger fish like <b>bluefish.</b> Other fish can substitute it, including weakfish, tilefish, blackfish, small <b>bluefish,</b> catfish, salmon, swordfish, and shark. Striped bass is easily grilled in fillets, and is therefore popular in beach communities.|$|E
25|$|In marine environments {{trolling}} {{is used in}} big-game fishing {{to catch}} large offshore or open-water species such as tuna and marlin. Saltwater anglers also troll for inshore species such as <b>bluefish,</b> kingfish and various jacks.|$|E
25|$|The Ballpark at Harbor Yard {{serves as}} a minor-league {{baseball}} stadium, and was built in 1998 {{to serve as the}} homefield of the Bridgeport <b>Bluefish.</b> It is located downtown on a former brownfield site. It is visually prominent to commuters on I-95 or on passing trains.|$|E
25|$|The Hartford Yard Goats of the Eastern League are a AA {{affiliate}} of the Colorado Rockies. Also, the Connecticut Tigers {{play in the}} New York-Penn League and are a A {{affiliate of}} the Detroit Tigers. The Bridgeport <b>Bluefish</b> and the New Britain Bees play in the Atlantic League.|$|E
25|$|Electricity is {{provided}} to Yellowknife by Northland Utilities, serving 6,350 residential and 800 commercial customers. Yellowknife operates {{almost entirely on}} hydroelectricity from the Snare-Bluefish systems, provided by the Northwest Territories Power Corporation (NTPC). NTPC's local production capacity is 67.9 megawatts, 30.89MW from 10 generators at the Jackfish Diesel Plant, 28.8MW from Snare Lake, and 7.5MW from Miramar <b>Bluefish.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} minor league {{baseball}} and hockey teams based in larger cities such as the Bridgeport <b>Bluefish</b> (baseball), the Bridgeport Sound Tigers (hockey), the Connecticut Tigers (baseball), the Hartford Yard Goats (baseball), the Hartford Wolf Pack (hockey), the Lowell Spinners (baseball), the Manchester Monarchs (hockey), the New Britain Bees (baseball), the New Hampshire Fisher Cats (baseball), the Pawtucket Red Sox (baseball), the Portland Sea Dogs (baseball), the Providence Bruins (hockey), the Springfield Thunderbirds (hockey), the Vermont Lake Monsters (baseball), and the Worcester Railers (hockey).|$|E
25|$|The Scandinavian {{fisherman}} {{founded the}} Independent Dock, {{which is now}} known as Viking Village and, today, provides a combined shopping and industrial establishment with both handcrafted goods and fresh seafood. Catches typically consist of scallops, tuna, swordfish, tilefish, weakfish, monkfish, <b>bluefish,</b> shad, dogfish, and various other types of in-shore fish. In the 1960s and 1970s, foreign trawlers were permitted to fish in the area. Nearly all of the cod to have been fished out of the area. The scallop boat Lindsay L, docked at Viking Village, was used in the movie The Perfect Storm.|$|E
25|$|Commercial fishing {{has always}} been an {{important}} component of the island economy. Historically, this trade included whaling and the hunting of dolphins. Until ice became available in the 1920s, the primary commercial catch was mullet, which was caught near the beaches of Shackleford Bank and Core Bank and salted on shore. In the late 19th century, the Core Sound area produced 80% of the salted mullet sold on the United States east coast. An ice plant was built in nearby Beaufort in 1920, and fish houses were established on the island to process fish and shellfish. Some bay areas on the north side of the island have been developed for harvesting cultured shellfish. In addition to mullet, the commercial fishing industry of Harkers Island brings in oysters, clams, shrimp, scallops, crabs, spot, croaker, trout, flounder, <b>bluefish,</b> and mackerel.|$|E
25|$|On August 20, 2012, Clemens {{signed with}} the Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He made his debut for the Skeeters against the Bridgeport <b>Bluefish</b> on August 25, 2012, {{in front of a}} crowd of 7,724. It {{was the first time the}} 50-year-old had taken the mound in almost five years. Clemens pitched 3 {{scoreless}} innings and struck out two: former major leaguers Joey Gathright and Prentice Redman. He also retired Luis Figueroa, who played briefly with the Pirates, Blue Jays and the Giants. Clemens allowed only one hit and no walks on 37 pitches in the Skeeters' 1-0 victory. Clemens made his second start for the Skeeters on September 7 against the Long Island Ducks. He pitched 4 scoreless innings, with his son, Koby, as his catcher. He retired former New York Met outfielder Timo Perez for the final out in the fourth inning, and was named the winning pitcher by the official scorer. Clemens' fastball was clocked as high as 88mph, and the Astros sent scouts to both of his outings with the Skeeters in consideration of a possible return to the team that season.|$|E
25|$|The Barnstormers' first playing season came in 2005 at {{the newly}} built Clipper Magazine Stadium. On May 11, the Barnstormers lost their first game 4–3 to the Atlantic City Surf, {{in front of}} 7,300 fans. They {{finished}} the 2005 season {{with a record of}} 64 wins and 76 losses. In finishing {{the first half of the}} 2006 season with a record of 38–25, the Barnstormers qualified for their first Atlantic League playoff berth. They followed this feat with a second-half win, posting a record of 37–26. After besting division challenger, Atlantic City, in the first round of the playoffs, the Barnstormers swept the Bridgeport <b>Bluefish</b> on October 1, 2006 for their first ever Atlantic League championship, in only their second season. Pitcher Denny Harriger threw a complete game, breaking a franchise record for consecutive pitches. In doing so, the Barnstormers became the first Atlantic League team in history to sweep their way through both rounds of the playoffs on the way to a title. It was the city of Lancaster’s first professional championship since 1955, when the former Red Roses won the Piedmont League title. The Barnstormers played in the 2012 Atlantic League Championship Series but were ultimately defeated by the Long Island Ducks in Game 5.|$|E
500|$|In 1803, Ezra I {{earned the}} nickname, [...] "King Caesar", {{partly due to}} his ambitious character, but also due to his victory in a local {{political}} conflict that year involving {{the construction of the}} first <b>Bluefish</b> River Bridge in Duxbury. Ezra I succeeded in pushing the expensive project through town meeting, much to the consternation of his opponents. When Ezra I died in 1822, the nickname passed to Ezra Weston II.|$|E
500|$|Marine environments are near-pristine with a {{mixtures}} of temperate, subtropical and tropical species derived from cool-temperate ocean currents {{in the winter}} and the warm East Australian Current, which flows from the Great Barrier Reef, in summer. Of the 490 fish species recorded 13 are endemic and 60% are tropical. The main angling fish are yellowtail kingfish and New Zealand <b>bluefish</b> while game fish include marlin, tuna and giant kingfish called [...] "greenbacks". Over 80 species of coral occur in the reefs surrounding the islands. Australian underwater photographer Neville Coleman has photographed various nudibranchs at Lord Howe Island.|$|E
500|$|In {{the northwestern}} Atlantic, around 60% of the dusky shark's diet {{consists}} of bony fishes, from over ten families with <b>bluefish</b> (Pomatomus saltatrix) and summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) being especially important. Cartilaginous fishes, mainly skates and their egg cases, are the second-most important dietary component, while the lady crab (Ovalipes ocellatus) {{is also a}} relatively significant food source. In South African and Australian waters, bony fishes are again the most important prey type. Newborn and juvenile sharks subsist mainly on small pelagic prey such as sardines and squid; older sharks over [...] long broaden their diets to include larger bony and cartilaginous fishes. The run of the southern African pilchard (Sardinops sagax), occurring off the eastern coast of South Africa every winter, is attended by medium and large-sized dusky sharks. Pregnant and post-partum females do not join, possibly because the energy cost of gestation leaves them unable to pursue such swift prey. One South African study reported that 0.2% of the sharks examined had preyed upon bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus).|$|E
2500|$|Highlands {{became known}} for sport {{fishing in the}} 1920s. [...] Today, countless boats {{can be seen in}} the rivers, bays and ocean to catch fluke, <b>bluefish,</b> striped bass or whiting.|$|E
2500|$|By 16,000 {{years ago}} the glacial melt allowed people to move by land south and east out of Beringia, and into Canada. [...] The Queen Charlotte Islands, Old Crow Flats, and <b>Bluefish</b> Caves contain some of the {{earliest}} Paleo-Indian archaeological sites in Canada. Ice Age hunter-gatherers of this period left lithic flake fluted stone tools and the remains of large butchered mammals.|$|E
2500|$|Cuttyhunk {{continues}} to be a popular site for sportfishing, with striped bass and <b>bluefish</b> being the most frequent catches. [...] Lobstering is an occupation for a few of the island’s residents, as is boat building, shellfishing, and carpentry. [...] The island is served by a ferry named the M/V Cuttyhunk, which makes frequent trips to Cuttyhunk from New Bedford during the summer.|$|E
2500|$|Pre-Last Glacial Maximum {{migration}} across Beringia {{into the}} Americas {{has been proposed}} to explain purported pre-LGM ages of archaeosites in the Americas such as <b>Bluefish</b> Caves and Old Crow Flats in the Yukon Territory, and Meadowcroft Rock Shelter in Pennsylvania. The earlier 14C date from a bone artifact at the Old Crow Flats site has been supplanted by an Accelerator Mass Spectrometry 14C date that indicates a Holocene age. The interpretations of butcher marks and the geologic association of bones at the <b>Bluefish</b> Cave and Old Crow Flats sites have been called into question. The ages of the earliest positively identified artifacts at the Meadowcroft site are constrained by a compiled age estimate from 14C {{in the range of}} 12k-15k 14C years BP (13.8k-18.5k cal years BP). [...] The Meadowcroft Rockshelter site and the Monte Verde site in southern Chile, with a date of 14.8k cal years BP, are the archaeosites in the Americas with the oldest dates that have gained broad acceptance.|$|E

2500|$|A scenic {{overlook}} {{is located}} {{at the north end of}} the bridge and was formerly located at South Thimble Island, near the south end. At South Thimble Island, passing ships may include U.S. Navy warships, nuclear submarines, and aircraft carriers, as well as large cargo vessels and sailing ships. A restaurant and gift shop on the island opened in 1964, along with the [...] Sea Gull Pier. <b>Bluefish,</b> trout, croaker, flounder, and other species have been caught from the pier. Since birds use the habitat created by the bridges and islands of the CBBT, birders have travelled to the bridge–tunnel to see them at South Thimble Island and the scenic overlook at the north end. As part of the Thimble Shoal Channel Tunnel twinning, the building housing the restaurant and gift shop closed and access to the pier was prohibited starting at the end of September 2017. The building will be demolished and not replaced, and the pier will reopen to the public at the end of the project in 2022.|$|E
2500|$|The widely {{variable}} diet of {{the species}} throughout its life stages led authors in the 1950s and 1960s to conclude the species was indiscriminate in its feeding habits, eating whatever was locally available. The diets of the populations in both the southern USA and Ghana also varied quite markedly by season and year, which led the authors of both these studies to agree with these earlier conclusions. Recent laboratory studies, however, [...] have shown the species may have preferences for certain sizes of prey. In these experiments, the fish were presented {{with a range of}} size classes of the same prey species, Menidia beryllina, with the results showing they prefer to take the smallest size class possible, which contrasts with more aggressive predators, such as <b>bluefish.</b> Both adults and juveniles feed throughout the day, generally becoming inactive at night. During some feeding periods recorded in Ghana, digestion in the species was so rapid that food becomes unidentifiable within four to five hours of consumption. The crevalle jack is also an important prey species itself, taken by larger fish, such as billfish and sharks, as well as seabirds. As well as being preyed on during its adult stage, the spawn of the crevalle jack is known to be eaten by planktivorous organisms, including whale sharks in the Caribbean.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an earlier}} time, one person had {{described}} the transparency of the water: [...] "I remember the time, gentlemen, {{when you could}} go in twelve feet of water {{and you could see}} the pebbles on the bottom of this river." [...] As the water got more polluted, it darkened, underwater vegetation (such as photosynthesizing seagrass) began dying, and as the seagrass beds declined, the many associated species of their ecosystems declined as well, contributing to the decline of the river. Also harmful was the general destruction of the once plentiful oyster beds in the waters around the city, and the over-fishing of menhaden, or mossbunker, a small silvery fish which had been used since the time of the Native Americans for fertilizing crops - however it took 8,000 of these schooling fish to fertilize a single acre, so mechanized fishing using the purse seine was developed, and eventually the menhaden population collapsed. [...] Menhaden feed on phytoplankton, helping to keep them in check, and are also a vital step in the food chain, as <b>bluefish,</b> striped bass and other fish species which do not eat phytoplankton feed on the menhaden. [...] The oyster is another filter feeder: oysters purify 10 to 100 gallons a day, while each menhaden filters four gallons in a minute, and their schools were immense: one report had a farmer collecting 20 oxcarts worth of menhaden using simple fishing nets deployed from the shore. [...] The combination of more sewage, due to the availability of more potable water [...] New York's water consumption per capita was twice that of Europe [...] indoor plumbing, the destruction of filter feeders, and the collapse of the food chain, damaged the ecosystem of the waters around New York, including the East River, almost beyond repair.|$|E

The {{mackerel}} are gone, the <b>bluefish</b> are going, the menhaden are gone, every year the amberjack and kingfish grow smaller and fewer. We must find ways and means to save our game fish of the sea; and one of the finest and most sportsman-like ways is to use light tackle.|$|E
