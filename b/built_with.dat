5|$|Another council plan {{during the}} 1960s was to {{separate}} pedestrians and traffic, {{and it was}} proposed that any new buildings in City Square would be <b>built</b> <b>with</b> an overhead walkway – this never came to fruition, with only a short section ever being built.|$|E
5|$|Australia and New Zealand were <b>built</b> <b>with</b> a {{different}} arrangement. The spotting top {{on the main}} mast was deleted and an armoured spotting tower was built instead into the conning tower where it was better protected, had an improved field of vision and {{direct access to the}} primary conning position. The rear Transmitting Station was also deleted and the forward TS was consequently enlarged. Their 'A' turrets were <b>built</b> <b>with</b> the improvements listed above.|$|E

5|$|Cardonal de Panilonco and La Aguada; most of {{the already}} damaged {{buildings}} in La Aguada fell down, including the local church. The road to Cardonal de Panilonco was damaged, and many houses <b>built</b> <b>with</b> adobe did not resist the shaking.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} stages of {{excavation}} of the wreck, it was believed that the ship had originally been <b>built</b> <b>with</b> clinker (or clench) planking, a technique where the hull consisted of overlapping planks that bore the structural strength of the ship. Cutting gunports into a clinker-built hull would have meant weakening the ship's structural integrity, and it was assumed that she was later rebuilt to accommodate a hull with carvel edge-to-edge planking with a skeletal structure to support a hull perforated with gunports. Later examination indicates that the clinker planking is not present throughout the ship; only the outer structure of the sterncastle is <b>built</b> <b>with</b> overlapping planking, though not with a true clinker technique.|$|E
5|$|From West Main Street to South Avenue, {{the bridge}} {{supports}} were largely <b>built</b> <b>with</b> concrete while the supports on the section between Brown Street and West Main Street were mostly <b>built</b> <b>with</b> steel. Unlike the concrete supports, the steel supports flexed throughout the year, creating holes and {{gaps in the}} pavement on the deck above. The city of Rochester, which owns and maintains the section of NY31 within the city, closed the outer northbound lane of West Broad Street (westbound NY31) between Brown and Main Streets in June 2008 for this reason.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, local {{politicians}} {{proposed that the}} line be built administratively {{as part of the}} Jæren Line, but this was rejected by the government. Instead, the ministry wanted to again consider the Ålgård Line as part of the Sørlandet Line, and proposed that the Ålgård Line be <b>built</b> <b>with</b> standard gauge—which would be used for the Sørlandet Line—instead of the narrow gauge used by the Jæren Line. However, there would be no need for standard gauge until the Sørlandet Line was extended to Rogaland, so the line was planned to be <b>built</b> <b>with</b> narrow gauge track, but all other installations would be prepared for standard gauge.|$|E

5|$|A Thousand Leaves is the 10th studio album by the American {{experimental}} {{rock band}} Sonic Youth. It {{was released on}} May 12, 1998, by DGC Records. A Thousand Leaves was the band's first album recorded at their own studio in Lower Manhattan, which was <b>built</b> <b>with</b> the money they had made at the 1995 Lollapalooza music festival. Since the band had an unlimited {{amount of time to}} work in their studio, the album features numerous lengthy and improvisational tracks that were developed unevenly. Three highly experimental extended plays, , , and , were recorded simultaneously with the album.|$|E
5|$|A new {{construction}} technique {{was employed to}} save weight. Previous battlecruisers were <b>built</b> <b>with</b> a combination of transverse and longitudinal steel frames; the Derfflinger-class ships dispensed with the transverse frames and used only the longitudinal ones. This enabled the ship to retain structural strength and a lower weight. As with all preceding capital ships, the outer hull spaces between the hull wall and the torpedo bulkhead were used for coal storage.|$|E
5|$|A {{road from}} US 82 to MS 1 was {{constructed}} during 1940, and opened in 1941. The road was unsigned, and was already paved in concrete. It was designated as MS 454 by 1953. By 1999, US 278 became concurrent with US 82 through MS 454's western terminus. A bypass around Greenville has been planned in the 1990s, and construction began in 2008. It was partially built before funding stopped. A bridge for MS 454's future alignment has been <b>built,</b> <b>with</b> no roads connecting to it.|$|E

It is for the most part residential; on the northern side stands the Belvedere Court block of flats. <b>Built</b> <b>with</b> the road in the 1930s, the building is now Grade II Listed as an example of 1930s architecture.|$|E
5|$|All {{houses were}} <b>built</b> <b>with</b> marble-mantelpieced {{fireplaces}} and flues.
