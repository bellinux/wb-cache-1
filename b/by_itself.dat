5|$|Borscht, {{like any}} other soup in East Slavic cuisines, is seldom eaten <b>by</b> <b>itself,</b> but rather {{accompanied}} by a side dish. At a minimum, spoonfuls of borscht are alternated with bites of a slice of bread.

5|$|Considered <b>by</b> <b>itself,</b> Artemisium was a {{relatively}} insignificant battle. The Allies did not defeat the Persian navy, nor prevent it from advancing further {{along the coast of}} Greece. Conversely, neither did the Persians destroy the Greek fleet, nor irreparably weaken it. The battle was thus an indecisive one, which pleased neither side.|$|E
5|$|Corn (USA), or maize (British English), is {{the second}} most {{palatable}} grain. It provides twice as much digestible energy as an equal volume of oats and is low in fiber. Because of these characteristics, it is easy to over-feed corn, causing obesity, so horses are seldom fed corn all <b>by</b> <b>itself.</b> Nutritionists caution horse owners that moldy corn is poisonous if fed to horses.|$|E
