5|$|The {{compound}} had no Internet or landline telephone service. Its residents burned their refuse, {{unlike their}} neighbors, who set their garbage out for collection. Local residents called the building the Waziristan Haveli, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> {{the owner was}} from Waziristan. Following the American raid and killing of bin Laden, the Pakistani government demolished the compound in February 2012.|$|E
5|$|Wirth Business Credit is a small-business {{supplies}} {{leasing company}} owned by Winmark. In a 2008 {{interview with the}} Star Tribune, CEO John Morgan said Winmark plowed the $9 million to $10 million in profit from its franchisees into Wirth Business Credit <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> leasing supplies will become a profitable business even though the current growth had been slow. In 2008, there were 27 Wirth Business Credit franchises.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{sales of}} private {{underground}} blast shelters increased noticeably after 2009, with many construction companies' advertisements {{calling attention to}} the 2012 apocalypse. In Michigan, schools were closed for the Christmas holidays two days early, in part because rumours of the 2012 apocalypse were raising fears of repeat shootings similar to that at Sandy Hook. American reality TV stars Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt revealed that they had spent most of their $10 million of accumulated earnings by 2010 <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> the world would end in 2012.|$|E

5|$|Lewis {{argues that}} Applewhite {{effectively}} controlled his followers by packaging his teachings in familiar terms. Richard Hecht of the University of California, Santa Barbara, echoes this sentiment, arguing {{that members of}} the group killed themselves <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> the narrative that he had constructed, rather than because he psychologically controlled them. In his 2000 study of apocalyptic movements, John R. Hall posits that they were motivated to commit suicide because they saw {{it as a way to}} demonstrate that they had conquered the fear of death and truly believed Applewhite.|$|E
5|$|Michelle Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, {{also known}} as the omnibus autism {{proceeding}} (OAP), was a court case involving the family of Michelle Cedillo, an autistic girl whose parents sued the United States government <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> that her autism was caused by her receipt of both the measles-mumps-and-rubella vaccine ({{also known as}} the MMR vaccine) and thimerosal-containing vaccines. The omnibus proceeding required the petitioners to present three test cases for each proposed mechanism by which vaccines had, according to them, caused their children's autism; Michelle was the first such case for the MMR-and-thimerosal hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|The Mariners faced much {{adversity}} in the Newcastle region {{because of}} the Australian Rugby League's Newcastle Knights team being already well established in the region. The club played its home games at Topper Stadium and missed out on the finals of the 1997 Super League season, but made the grand final of the World Club Challenge. The team was overshadowed by the Newcastle Knights who won the ARL competition and were admitted into the 1998 re-united competition. The Mariners were disbanded after being {{left out of the}} new competition <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> that the Hunter region could not support two entities.|$|E

5|$|The {{rejection}} of their protest greatly upset the German forces, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> {{they were treated}} unjustly in the war. Shortly after the protest was rejected, Germany issued threats that they would punish all captured American soldiers that {{were found to be}} armed with a shotgun. This led to the United States issuing a retaliation threat, stating that any measures unjustly taken against captured American soldiers would lead to an equal act by the United States on captured German soldiers.|$|E
5|$|British Waterways {{introduced}} a similar system in September 1974. Called BACAT, for Barges Aboard Catamaran, the system consisted of trains of barges, which were pushed by a tug, and {{which would be}} loaded between the twin hulls of a custom-built delivery ship. The ship would then transport them across the North Sea to continental waterways, without their contents having to be transshipped. The concept failed after 18 months, as the dock workers at Hull blacklisted the entire British Waterways fleet, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> that the system would threaten their jobs. Most of the commercial traffic using the navigation now consists of petroleum tankers and gravel barges.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Shaughnessy hired {{his former}} {{teammate}} Bernie Bierman {{as an assistant}} coach. Bierman remained on the staff for three seasons before he left to become head coach at Mississippi A. In 1924, Tulane set a new school record for wins and finished with an 8–1 record. The following season, the Green Wave bested the prior year's mark and posted a 9–0–1 record. School officials declined an invitation to face Washington in the Rose Bowl, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> the Tulane players were too small. Indiana University attempted to hire Shaughnessy after his undefeated season, but he instead chose to sign a ten-year extension with Tulane.|$|E

5|$|In {{advance of}} the 2000 United States Census, city {{officials}} made a push to get residents to respond {{and participate in the}} enumeration, citing calculations by city officials that as many as 30,000 people were not reflected in estimates from the Census Bureau, which resulted in the loss of government aid and political representation. It is believed that heavily immigrant areas of Newark were significantly undercounted in the 2010 Census, especially in the East Ward. Many households refused to participate in the census, with immigrants often reluctant to submit census forms <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> that the information could be used to justify their deportation.|$|E
5|$|New Labour {{accepted}} the economic efficiency of {{free markets and}} believed {{that they could be}} detached from capitalism to achieve the aims of socialism, while maintaining the efficiency of capitalism. Markets were also useful for giving power to consumers and allowing citizens {{to make their own decisions}} and act responsibly. New Labour embraced market economics <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> they could be used for their social aims, as well as economic efficiency. The party did not believe that public ownership was efficient or desirable; ensuring that they were not seen to be ideologically pursuing centralised public ownership was important to the party. In government, the party relied on public-private partnerships and private finance initiatives to raise funds and mitigate fears of a 'tax and spend' policy or excessive borrowing.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{report on}} the {{accident}} noted, but did not criticise, the medical operation at the scene. It described how paramedics attended {{to those who were}} conscious with life-threatening injuries, but did not make any attempts to resuscitate victims who appeared drowned or lacked vital signs <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> that they could not be revived because they had succumbed to the cold salt water. It was estimated by the authorities who attended the scene of the crash that 15 ambulances responded to the accident site, all of which were used to transport the injured to hospitals, and that 40 additional ambulances were available near the site of the crash, but were not needed.|$|E

5|$|The aye-aye {{is almost}} universally viewed unfavorably across Madagascar, though the tales vary from village to village and region to region. If people see an aye-aye, they may kill it and hang the corpse on a pole near a road {{outside of town}} (so others can carry the bad {{fortunes}} away) or burn their village and move. The superstitions behind aye-aye fady include beliefs that they kill and eat chickens or people, that they kill people in their sleep by cutting their aortic vein, that they embody ancestral spirits, or that they warn of illness, death, or bad luck in the family. As of 1970, {{the people of the}} Marolambo District in the Toamasina Province feared the aye-aye <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> it had supernatural powers. Because of this, no one was allowed to mock, kill, or eat one.|$|E
5|$|The {{conclusion}} of the Cambodian Civil War and the Fall of Saigon in April 1975 immediately brought a new conflict between Vietnam and Kampuchea. Although both the North Vietnamese and the Khmer Rouge had previously fought side by side, {{the leaders of the}} newly created Democratic Kampuchea continued to view Vietnam with great suspicion, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> the Vietnamese Communists had never given up their dream of creating an Indochinese federation with Vietnam as the leader. For that reason, the Kampuchean Government decided to remove all North Vietnamese military forces from Kampuchean territory shortly after their capture of Phnom Penh on 17 April 1975. In the first major clash between the two former allies, the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army invaded the Vietnamese island of Phú Quốc on 1 May 1975 (barely 24 hours after Saigon fell), which they claimed was part of Kampuchea’s territory.|$|E
5|$|Dolman joined Howard and Lucas at Skywalker Ranch for {{a series}} of lengthy story conferences, and wrote seven drafts of his script between the spring and fall of 1986. Pre-production began in late 1986. Various major film studios turned down the chance to {{distribute}} and co-finance it with Lucasfilm <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> the fantasy genre was unsuccessful. This was largely due to films such as Krull, Legend, Dragonslayer, and Labyrinth. Lucas took it to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), which was headed by Alan Ladd, Jr. Ladd and Lucas shared a relationship {{as far back as the}} mid-1970s, when Ladd, running 20th Century Fox, greenlighted Lucas' idea for Star Wars. However, in 1986, MGM was facing financial troubles, and major investment in a fantasy film was perceived as a risk. Ladd advanced half the $35 million budget for it in return for theatrical and television rights, leaving Lucasfilm with home video and pay television rights to offer in exchange for the other half.|$|E
2500|$|The second model, the {{perception}} mediation model, suggests {{that individuals with}} high core self-evaluations {{will be more likely}} to perceive higher levels of the appropriate job characteristics than individuals with low core self-evaluations. For example, those low in the CSE trait will likely perceive less job autonomy and thus, have lower job satisfaction <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> outside forces control their lives.

5|$|During the 2004 trial {{regarding}} {{allegations of}} Rush Limbaugh's drug abuse, the ACLU argued that his privacy {{should not have}} been compromised by allowing law enforcement examination of his medical records. In June 2004, the school district in Dover, Pennsylvania, required that its high school biology students listen to a statement which asserted that the theory of evolution is not fact and mentioning intelligent design as an alternative theory. Several parents called the ACLU to complain, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> that the school was promoting a religious idea in the classroom and violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The ACLU, joined by Americans United for Separation of Church and State, represented the parents in a lawsuit against the school district. After a lengthy trial, Judge John E. Jones III ruled in favor of the parents in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District decision, finding that intelligent design is not science and permanently forbidding the Dover school system from teaching intelligent design in science classes.|$|E
5|$|In July 1996, Firaxis {{began work}} on Alpha Centauri, with Reynolds heading the project. Meier and Reynolds wrote playable {{prototype}} code and Jason Coleman wrote the first lines of the development libraries. Because the development of Gettysburg took up most of Firaxis' time, the designers spent the first year prototyping the basic ideas. By late 1996, the developers were playing games on the prototype, and {{by the middle of}} the next year, they were working on a multiplayer engine. Although Firaxis intended to include multiplayer support in its games, an important goal was to create games with depth and longevity in single-player mode <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> that the majority of players spend most of their time playing this way. Reynolds felt that smart computer opponents are an integral part of a classic computer game, and considered it a challenge to make them so. Reynolds' previous games omitted internet support because he believed that complex turn-based games with many player options and opportunities for player input are difficult to facilitate online.|$|E
5|$|The Duke of Kent died quite {{suddenly}} in 1820, followed quickly by his father, King George III. Victoria's uncle, the Prince Regent, ascended the throne as King George IV. Victoria was now third {{in line to}} the throne, after her uncles the Duke of York and the Duke of Clarence, {{both of whom were}} well past middle age and neither of whom had legitimate heirs. As the likely eventual heir, Victoria had to be educated accordingly. Feodora was now 14, and no longer required the services of a governess. After the dismissal of nursemaid Mrs. Brock, Lehzen – as she was always known in the household – took over five-year-old Victoria's care in 1824. The Duchess and her comptroller, John Conroy made the appointment not only because Lehzen was German (rather than English), but also <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> she was unlikely to operate independently of their wishes.|$|E
