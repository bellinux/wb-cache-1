With a second-place finish in the penultimate mass start race of the season, Neuner won the 2007–08 Mass start World Cup. At the season final in Oslo, she also claimed the season's Sprint World Cup and took over the yellow bib of the Overall World Cup leader {{for the first time}} in her career. In the last race of the season, a ninth place in the mass start ensured Neuner the 2007–08 Overall <b>Biathlon</b> World Cup victory. She was the youngest Overall World Cup winner since the International <b>Biathlon</b> Union was established in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Neuner {{had been}} {{involved}} in a nearly two-year relationship with Austrian ski technician and former biathlete Franz Perwein, whom she had met during the 2006 Junior/Youth World Championships. Until the autumn of 2009, she then lived in a relationship with DSV chief <b>biathlon</b> technician Björn Weisheit for 19 months.|$|E
5|$|Neuner started <b>biathlon</b> {{when she}} {{was nine years old}} after she had participated in a try out course at her local ski club. She won 29 races at the <b>biathlon</b> Student's Cup of the German Ski Association (DSV), {{claiming}} the overall title in her respective age-group for four years in a row from 1999 to 2002. After finishing school, Neuner joined the German Customs Administration in August 2003 to become a member in the government-supported Customs-Ski-Team (Zoll-Ski-Team).

5|$|The FIS Cross-Country World Cup {{has been}} hosted three times, in 1993, 2000 and 2002, all in February or March. The FIS Nordic Combined World Cup has been hosted seven {{times at the}} stadium, in 1998, 2000, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2009 and 2010. All tournaments have been held in December, and have seen the ski jumping {{competition}} hosted at Lysgårdsbakken, the Olympic ski jumping hill in Lillehammer. Birkebeineren hosted <b>Biathlon</b> World Cup events from 1993 to 1997. The stadium has also since 1992 been used as the goal area for Birkebeinerrennet, an annual ski marathon with thousands of participants. It has also hosted the Norwegian Nordic Ski Championships in 1993. Lillehammer is scheduled to host the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics.

5|$|The Olympic Winter Institute of Australia has {{programs}} in alpine skiing, freestyle skiing (aerial and mogul), snowboarding, short track speed skating, figure skating and (along with the Australian Institute of Sport) skeleton. Australia also competed in <b>biathlon,</b> cross-country skiing, bobsleigh and luge at the 2006 Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The Olympic {{program was}} {{adjusted}} {{from that of}} the 1956 Winter Olympics omitting bobsleigh and adding a sport new to Olympic competition, men's <b>biathlon.</b> The sport of military patrol, similar to <b>biathlon,</b> had previously been a medal sport in 1924 and a demonstration sport in 1928, 1936 and 1948. The removal of bobsleigh from the Olympic program was by necessity; the site for the 1960 Games lacked a bobsleigh track and the funds were not available to build one. Despite only five nations confirming their intention to take part, the removal of the event from the program garnered international criticism. Both men and women competed at the 1960 Games, with women taking part in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, and speed skating.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{is a list of}} all Winter Olympics and World Cup events to be held at the stadium. It includes date, sport (cross-country skiing, Nordic combined or <b>biathlon),</b> tournament, distance, and top three athletes (gold, silver and bronze).|$|E

At the season final in Khanty-Mansiysk, Neuner won the pursuit race—her 14th World Cup win. She ended the season fourth in the Overall <b>Biathlon</b> World Cup, which was generally considered disappointing in the media.|$|E
5|$|Athletes from 21 {{countries}} won {{at least}} one medal, 15 of them winning {{at least one}} gold medal. For the second consecutive Winter Games, Russia won the most medals in total, with 38.

5|$|Australia {{has participated}} in <b>biathlon</b> at every Olympics since 1984 except for 2002; Kerryn Rim's eighth place in 1994 in the 15km {{individual}} event was their best result. Cameron Morton represented Australia in 2006 and finished in the bottom 10% {{in each of his}} two races. In 2010, Australia's sole representative Alexei Almoukov came second last in his event—one competitor did not finish. Rim's result remains the only top-20 finish by an Australian in the discipline, and more than 80% of Australian entrants have finished in {{the bottom half of the}} field, including many in the bottom fifth.|$|E
5|$|During her seven {{season on}} the World Cup tour, Neuner had competed {{in a total of}} 175 races, winning 47 of them (a 26.86 win percentage). She has claimed at least one win in each {{discipline}} of <b>biathlon</b> and has scored World Cup points in all but three of her races.

5|$|During the 2005–06 season, Neuner {{made her}} first {{appearances}} in the <b>Biathlon</b> World Cup. Germany's women's national coach Uwe Müßiggang had already considered her for the team two years earlier, however, her parents and her hometown coaches Bernhard Kröll and Herbert Mayer were reluctant to let her start prematurely. On 13 January 2006, Neuner made her debut in the World Cup sprint race in Ruhpolding, Germany, where she substituted for the injured Uschi Disl. Although her first appearance ended unsuccessfully, coming in 41st place, she was appointed for nine more World Cup races {{for the remainder of}} the season.|$|E

Neuner also won the 2011–12 Sprint World Cup thanks to an {{unprecedented}} eight out of ten sprint wins. With ten victories in total, her final World Cup season was the most successful in her career. She also became only the second woman after Magdalena Forsberg to win the overall title more than twice. On 18 March 2012, Neuner ended her <b>biathlon</b> career with a sixth place in the Khanty-Mansiysk mass start.|$|E
5|$|In December 2003, Neuner won the German Cup for 17-year-olds, {{which led}} to her {{appointment}} for the 2003–04 European Cup competition for juniors. With four wins at European level, Neuner qualified for the 2004 Junior/Youth World Championships in Haute Maurienne, France, where she won the sprint and relay events, as well as silver in the pursuit. One year later at the 2005 Junior/Youth World Championships in Kontiolahti, Finland, she claimed two silver medals (pursuit and relay), and again won the sprint discipline. With her success at junior level, Neuner at 18 years old, {{was considered one of}} Germany's biggest <b>biathlon</b> talents ever. Even before achieving any results at senior level, she had signed a sponsorship deal.|$|E
5|$|Lillehammer Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track {{hosted the}} {{skeleton}} {{part of the}} FIBT World Championships in 1995, {{as well as the}} FIL World Luge Championships in 1995. Birkebeineren hosted its last <b>Biathlon</b> World Cup event in 1997, and its last cross-country skiing World Cup event was in March 2002. The FIS Nordic Combined World Cup has been hosted in Lillehammer on various occasions, most recently in December 2010.

In {{the history of the}} International <b>Biathlon</b> Union she is ranked second behind Magdalena Forsberg (42), with Uschi Disl (30) third, for all-time career victories. In addition, she has won nine relay races and three mixed relay events as part of the German World Cup team. Neuner has often started slowly {{at the beginning of a}} winter season and has claimed only three of her individual victories before Christmas. Consequently, 18 of her 47 wins came in the month of March. Geographically most of her wins occurred in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia (10), followed by Antholz, Italy (6) and Ruhpolding, Germany (6).|$|E
5|$|The Olympic {{programme}} was adjusted {{from that}} of the 1936 Winter Olympics with the addition of skeleton for men. The sport had first appeared at the 1928 Winter Olympics, which had also taken place in St. Moritz, but would not make another appearance until 2002 in Salt Lake City. Two demonstration sports were held in St. Moritz, winter pentathlon and military patrol. This was the fourth time military patrol had been held as a demonstration event, the closely related sport of <b>biathlon</b> was added to the programme beginning with the 1960 Squaw Valley Olympics. Both men and women competed in the 1948 Games, with women taking part in alpine skiing and figure skating.|$|E
5|$|With a 78% accuracy, Neuner had solid {{shooting}} results {{during her}} 2005–06 season debut. Her average dropped to 74% {{in her first}} complete season in 2006–07. Neuner won the 2007–08 <b>Biathlon</b> World Cup with a shooting accuracy of 73%, which is the lowest result for an Overall World Cup winner ever and roughly ten per cent below the previous three winners' averages: Andrea Henkel (84%), Kati Wilhelm (87%) and Sandrine Bailly (81%). She steadily increased her shooting percentages in the following two seasons with a 76% average in 2008–09, and her career best results of 82% in the 2009–10 Olympic season. In the 2010–11 season, she set her career high in the standing position with a 75% accuracy.|$|E
5|$|At the 2011 World Championships in Khanty-Mansiysk, Neuner {{won three}} gold and two silver medals.

She {{finished second in the}} pursuit and fifth in the individual subsequently. On 12 March 2011, Neuner won her second title in the mass start despite of four shooing errors. The following day she also claimed gold in the women's relay, together with Andrea Henkel, Miriam Gössner and Tina Bachmann. Running the last leg for Germany, Neuner started in fourth, 67.5seconds off the lead, but she pulled back the entire time and moved in front on the last lap. Her five medals made her the most successful female athlete in the history of <b>Biathlon</b> World Championships.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Neuner hinted the {{upcoming}} season might be her last. She began the winter in Östersund with the best season start of her career, beating Tora Berger by 0.2 seconds in the sprint to claim her 25th World Cup win.
