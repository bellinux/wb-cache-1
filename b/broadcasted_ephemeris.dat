Results show that the bias of BeiDou <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> can reach up to 2 meter. To further verify this finding, we perform precise point positioning for about 18 MGEX stations using BeiDou <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> and wide-area differential correction parameters. Data of 97 days are analyzed and pseudo-range residuals of each frequency for each station are derived.

This proves that the BEB applying the differential correction parameters is mainly due to the biases of the TGD parameters in <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris.</b> By correcting the biases into TGD parameters, we performed point positioning at different stations. Results show that after applying the biases, the pseudo-range error reduces much, and the positioning precision can improve about 14. 9 %, 28. 4 %, 15. 5 % in N,E,U, direction for dual-frequency users, respectively...|$|R

A comparison of precise and broadcast ephemerides, treating the former as the standard, yielded information about the state disturbance that {{can be associated with}} the <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris.</b> Statistical information about the state disturbance was used with current observational data for improved position recovery. The rank deficiency problem encountered in the short arc geodetic adjustment procedure was analysed and it was deduced that the fundamental rank deficiency is six, scale information being derivable from the wavelength of transmission. Coordinate differences between stations coobserving a pass are estimable. The uncertainty of the <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris,</b> now in the WGS 72 system, was assessed.

Although GPS was developed for precise instantaneous position and velocity determination, {{it can be used}} for high precision relative positioning, with numerous applications for both surveyors and geodesists. The high resolution of the satellite's carrier phase has enabled relative positioning accuracies of the order of one part per million to be routinely obtained, from only one or two hours of data. These accuracies are obtained using the <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris,</b> which is the orbit data that is broadcast in the satellite's radio transmission. However, the <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> is estimated to be in error by up to twenty five metres and this error is one of the principle limitations for precise relative positioning with GPS. An alternative to the <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris,</b> is to determine the satellite orbits using the carrier phase measurements, obtained from a network of GPS tracking stations. This thesis describes the algorithms and processing techniques used for the determination of GPS satellite orbits using double differenced carrier phase measurements.

40|$|The {{frequent}} maneuvering of BeiDou Geostationary Orbit (GEO) and Inclined Geosynchronous Orbit (IGSO) satellites {{affects the}} availability of real-time orbit, and decreases the accuracy and performance of positioning, navigation and time (PNT) services. BeiDou satellite maneuver information cannot be obtained by common users. BeiDou <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> is the only indicator of the health status of satellites, which are broadcast on an hourly basis, easily leading to ineffective observations. Sometimes, identification errors of satellite abnormity also appear in the <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris.</b> This study presents a real-time robust detection method for a satellite orbital maneuver with high frequency and high reliability. By using the <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> and pseudo-range observations, the time discrimination factor and the satellite identification factor were defined and used for the real-time detection of start time and the pseudo-random noise code (PRN) of satellites was used for orbital maneuvers. Data from a Multi-GNSS Experiment (MGEX) was collected and analyzed. The {{results show that the}} start time and the PRN of the satellite orbital maneuver could be detected accurately in real time. In addition, abnormal start times and satellite abnormities caused by non-maneuver factors also could be detected using the proposed method. The new method not only improves the utilization of observations for users with the data effective for about 92 min, but also promotes the reliability of real-time PNT services...|$|R

40|$|Satellite {{orbit and}} clock {{corrections}} are always treated as known quantities in GPS positioning models. Therefore, any {{error in the}} satellite orbit and clock products will probably cause significant consequences for GPS positioning, especially for real-time applications. Currently three types of satellite products have been made available for real-time positioning, including the <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris,</b> the International GNSS Service (IGS) predicted ultra-rapid product, and the real-time product. In this study, these three predicted/real-time satellite orbit and clock products are first evaluated {{with respect to the}} post-mission IGS final product, which demonstrates cm to m level orbit accuracies and sub-ns to ns level clock accuracies. Impacts of real-time satellite orbit and clock products on GPS point and relative positioning are then investigated using the P 3 and GAMIT software packages, respectively. Numerical results show that the real-time satellite clock corrections affect the point positioning more significantly than the orbit corrections. On the contrary, only the real-time orbit corrections impact the relative positioning. Compared with the positioning solution using the IGS final product with the nominal orbit accuracy of ~ 2. 5 cm, the real-time <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> with ~ 2 m orbit accuracy provided < 2 cm relative positioning error for baselines no longer than 216 km. As for the baselines ranging from 574 to 2982 km, the cm–dm level positioning error was identified for the relative positioning solution using the <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris.</b> The real-time product could result in < 5 mm relative positioning accuracy for baselines within 2982 km, slightly better than the predicted ultra-rapid product...|$|R
40|$|In GPS {{satellite}} positioning, {{the satellite}} coordinates require to be continuously updated to obtain coordinates of ground single-point positioning by using determined coordinates and method of backward intersection. Real-time satellite coordinates {{are determined by}} <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris.</b> The <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> forecasts the data every two hours. If the data are used to calculate satellite coordinates, the data would be enormous and calculation is complex. Therefore, this study applied Chebyshev polynomials fitting method to reduce computation process and save data memory space. This study analyzed satellite data from the TC 02 GPS base station in Taichung City, applied Chebyshev polynomials to fit <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris,</b> and discusses impacts of sampling time and fitting order on 3 D components and precision results of satellite coordinates for ground point-positioning after fitting. In selection of fitting order, this study applied the 12 th order Chebyshev polynomials to fit experimental fitting order, because too many orders may require longer sampling time and cannot be used in calculation of real-time satellite positioning. Thus, the 12 th order was selected to balance sampling time and fitting precision. The fitting {{results showed that the}} fitting precision of 3 D coordinate components is lower than 2 m when using satellite coordinates of Chebyshev polynomials fitting. The satellite coordinates after fitting were used to calculate single-point positioning results of TC 02 GPS base station. Errors of the coordinate components were less than 6 m. The precision of fitting results were 0. 2 ~ 0. 5 m higher than that of satellite coordinates obtained from original equation. These findings can be used to reduce the computation procedure of satellite coordinates needed for GPS satellite single-point positioning. This study can improve the shortcomings in the equations of computing satellite coordinates using <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> to lift the speed of single-point positioning. 在GPS衛星定位中，需不斷的計算及更新衛星坐標，進而利用所得坐標進行地面後方交會法求得地面單點定位坐標。即時的衛星坐標是由廣播星曆計算而得。廣播星曆是以兩小時為間隔的預報資料，如果直接使用於計算衛星坐標，資料龐大且計算繁雜，故本研究加入切比雪夫多項式擬合法以簡化運算流程、減低資料內存空間等。 本研究以分析台中市TC 02 GPS基站所接收之衛星資料為基礎，研究利用切比雪夫(Chebyshev) 多項式擬合廣播星曆，就其採樣時間、擬合階數對衛星坐標三維分量的影響，以及分析擬合後衛星坐標用於地面單點定位之精度成果。 在擬合階數的選定上，本研究採用 12 階切比雪夫多項式擬合為實驗擬合階數，其原因在於過多階數會影響取樣時間過長，導致無法應用於即時衛星定位的計算，故將擬合階數選定在 12 階，以期在取樣時間及擬合精度上取得一個平衡。 根據本研究擬合結果顯示，使用切比雪夫多項式擬合之衛星坐標，其三維坐標分量之擬合精度在± 2 m以下，使用擬合後之衛星坐標用於計算TC 02 GPS基站單點定位成果，各坐標分量的中誤差都在± 6 m以下，其擬合結果較原公式法計算之衛星坐標精度約高出 0. 2 ~ 0. 5 m不等。 本研究成果可應用於簡化目前GPS衛星單點定位所需之衛星坐標計算流程。改善部分利用廣播星曆直接計算衛星坐標公式的缺點，進而提升單點定位之計算速度。摘要	i Abstract	ii 目錄	iii 圖目錄	v 表目錄	vii 第一章 緒論	 1 1 - 1 前言	 1 1 - 2 研究動機與目的	 1 1 - 3 文獻回顧	 2 1 - 4 論文架構	 3 第二章 研究理論基礎	 4 2 - 1 全球定位系統 (Global Positioning System,GPS) 	 4 2 - 1 - 1 GPS系統介紹	 4 2 - 1 - 2 GPS定位基本原理	 6 2 - 1 - 3 GPS之誤差來源	 7 2 - 2 廣播星曆 (<b>Broadcast</b> <b>Ephemeris)</b> 	 9 2 - 3 精密星曆 (Precise Ephemeris) 	 10 2 - 4 衛星軌道擬合	 11 第三章 研究方法與流程	 13 3 - 1 GPS定位測量之基本概念	 13 3 - 2 GPS衛星坐標計算	 13 3 - 3 切比雪夫多項式	 17 3 - 4 單點定位	 18 3 - 5 GPS衛星後方交會法測站坐標計算	 19 3 - 6 研究設計流程	 22 3 - 7 計算程式使用介紹	 25 第四章 研究成果分析	 27 4 - 1 公式計算衛星坐標結果	 27 4 - 2 切比雪夫多項式擬合衛星坐標結果	 29 4 - 2 - 1 切比雪夫多項式擬合階數比較	 30 4 - 2 - 2 12 階切比雪夫多項式擬合結果	 31 4 - 3 以擬合坐標用於單點定位精度分析	 33 第五章 結論與建議	 39 5 - 1 結論	 39 5 - 2 建議	 40 參考文獻	 41 附錄	 4...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of BeiDou satellite orbits during eclipse periods {{is an important}} part of the performance analysis of BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS). Accuracy evaluation of satellite orbits in ephemeris of BDS during eclipse periods can provide support for the service performance assessment. It also helps to find possible deficiencies in the orbit modeling during eclipse periods, which may further contribute to the improvements of functional models for precise orbit determination. The effects of eclipse periods on the orbits of the three types of satellites of BDS are analyzed with the satellite laser ranging (SLR) observations ranging from January 2014 to July 2015. At the same time, the orbit radial accuracy of BDS <b>broadcast</b> and precise <b>ephemeris</b> are validated. The results show that, obvious orbit accuracy decrease can be observed in both <b>broadcast</b> and precise <b>ephemeris</b> for IGSO/MEO satellites during eclipse periods (especially the yaw-maneuver periods). And orbit radial errors of IGSO/MEO satellites in <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> reach 1. 5 ~ 2. 0 m, and exceed 10. 0 cm for that in precise ephemeris. Performance decrease of the GEO satellite orbit during eclipse arcs can hardly be revealed by the orbit radial residual series. During non-eclipse periods, radial accuracy of IGSO/MEO and GEO satellite orbits in <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> are better than 0. 5 m and 0. 9 m respectively. The radial accuracy of IGSO/MEO satellite orbits in precise ephemeris are better than 10. 0 cm and that of the GEO satellite is about 50. 0 cm with a systematic bias of 40. 0 cm around...|$|R
40|$|In high {{precision}} positioning, its necessary that systematic errors inherent in several spatial positioning system, as the Global Navigation Satellite System, be minimized or even eliminated. Among them, stands out orbital errors, which occurs {{because of the}} variations in the reference: while the satellites coordinates are determined {{in relation to a}} fixed reference system (inertial), the coordinates of the stations located on the earth surface are subject to variations caused by the rotation of the Earth. Thus, errors present in the satellite coordinates are propagated directly to the users position. This fact can be noticed by the processing and adjustment of Global Positioning System datas, analyzing the variations caused by the choice of using either satellites orbits pos-processed (precise ephemeris) or orbits transmitted in real time (<b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris).</b> In order to study these discrepancies, 13 stations of the local GNSS lan, located in Federal University of Uberlândia, Santa Mônica campus, were surveyed with GPS receivers of single frequency (L 1), considering MGUB (Uberlândia, MG), station belonging to the Brazilian network for continuos monitoring, as the base, referenced to SIRGAS 2000 (epoch 2000, 4). Two strategies have been adopted in the datas processing: one applying <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> and other accurate ephemeris of the Internacional GNSS Service. It was verified that the variations between the results obtained with <b>broadcast</b> and accurate <b>ephemeris</b> are in the milimeter order for the vertical component, and in the centimetric order for horizontal components.

Each LAAS installation provides services through a LAAS Ground Facility (LGF) which {{is located at the}} airport it serves. By monitoring the GPS signals, measurements, and navigation messages, the LGF is able to exclude unhealthy satellites and broadcast real-time range-correction messages for healthy satellites to users via a VHF data link. Airborne users apply these corrections to remove errors that are common between the LGF and the aircraft. The LGF is also responsible for warning the aircraft of any potential integrity threats that cannot easily be resolved by excluding unhealthy satellites. One source of potential errors is the satellite <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> message, which users decode and use to compute GPS satellite positions. In LAAS, potential GPS ephemeris faults are categorized into two types, A and B, based upon whether or not the fault is associated with a satellite maneuver. This work focuses on aviation navigation threats caused by Type A faults. To detect and mitigate these threats, we investigate two LGF monitors based on comparing expected ranges and range rates (based on <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris)</b> with those measured by the LGF.

The more global ground stations cannot be built in the short term. The ground regional monitoring stations are difficult to observe the global Medium Earth Orbit Satellite (MEO) continuously, which leads to low precision of orbits in BDS real-time <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris.</b> Based on the above problems, in view of real time satellite GNSS data of low earth orbit satellite can effectively make up the lack of regional monitoring stations in space overlay, a method is proposed that the GNSS receivers of LEO satellites used as high dynamic space-based monitoring stations combining with the data of the ground monitoring stations to calculate and forecast the MEO satellite orbits. The numeral results show that, using the data of seven regional monitoring stations add 1 to 3 LEO satellites, the precision of the MEO orbit determination can be increased by about 21 %, 34 % and 55 % respectively.

40|$|Satellite {{velocity}} determination {{using the}} <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> is discussed {{and it is}} {{pointed out that the}} conventional rotation matrix method involves a complicated process of computation. This paper proposes an alternative method using a simple differentiator to derive satellite Earth-Centred-Earth-Fixed (ECEF) velocity from the ECEF satellite positions that are calculated using the standard ICD-GPS- 200 algorithm. The proposed algorithm simplifies the velocity transformation procedure, and therefore provides a good alternative. It is demonstrated that +/- 1 mm/s per axis ECEF satellite velocity is achievable by using the first-order central difference of a Taylor series approximation. A closed-form formula is also derived for the determination of GPS satellite ECEF acceleration using the <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris.</b> This formula is capable of accuracies better than +/- 0. 1 mm per second squared in each axis. With such a high accuracy of satellite acceleration in real-time, it is possible to detect the line-of-sight range acceleration precisely and as such it is concluded that a GPS receiver can be considered as a precise accelerometer. The success of the position differential method implies that real-time satellite ECEF velocities can be directly derived through numerical differentiation of the position polynomials. This is desirable for GPS velocity determination applications which require high output rate results in real-time. The derived closed-form formula for GPS satellite ECEF acceleration would benefit those who attempt to use a GPS receiver as an accurate accelerometer in real-time...|$|R

40|$|Precise {{satellite}} orbit and clocks {{are essential for}} providing high accuracy real-time PPP (Precise Point Positioning) service. However, by treating the predicted orbits as fixed, the orbital errors may be partially assimilated by the estimated satellite clock and hence impact the positioning solutions. This paper presents the impact analysis of errors in radial and tangential orbital components on the estimation of satellite clocks and PPP through theoretical study and experimental evaluation. The relationship between the compensation of the orbital errors by the satellite clocks and the satellite-station geometry is discussed in details. Based on the satellite clocks estimated with regional station networks of different sizes (∼ 100, ∼ 300, ∼ 500 and ∼ 700 km in radius), {{results indicated that the}} orbital errors compensated by the satellite clock estimates reduce as the size of the network increases. An interesting regional PPP mode based on the <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> and the corresponding estimated satellite clocks is proposed and evaluated through the numerical study.

40|$|The {{failure to}} detect {{anomalies}} and maneuvering of the orbits of navigation satellite sensors will deteriorate the performance of positioning and orbit determination. Motivated by {{the influence of the}} frequent maneuvering of BDS GEO and IGSO satellites, this paper analyzes the limitations of existing methods, where BDS orbit maneuvering and anomalies can be detected, and develops a method to solve this problem based on the RMS model of orbit mutual differences proposed in this paper. The performance of this method was assessed by comparison with the health flag of <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris,</b> precise orbit products of GFZ, the O-C values of a GNSS station and a conventional method. The results show that the performance of the method developed in this paper is better than that of the conventional method when the periodicity and trend items are obvious.

The Cartesian coordinates of these receiving points are determined within 2 m error in each axis by the precise ephemeris point-positioning and the test is made by estimating the radial offset between the translocation solution point and the above-specified standard point. Since the translocaiton {{is based on the}} <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> system and the standard points are in the precise ephemeris system, coordinate transform is required before direct comparison of the station coordinates. Tests showed that LeRoy 2 ̆ 7 s transform formula is appropriate in the region concerned, though 1. 5 - 2. 0 m transform discrepancy has to be considered. Since the translocation is a relative positioning technique of one station with respect to the other reference point, the error in the reference point may affect on the accuracy of translocation solution. Tests showed that when the "bug station" with large coordinate errors was used as the reference point, the involved errors transferred to the coordinates of the translocation solution point. It is thus imoprtant to use the reference point which is determined as accurate as possible. When the translocation is made relative to thus determined standard point, the convergence of the translocation solution can be obtained with a smaller number of satellite passes. The necessary passes to maintain 5 m absolute accuracy including uncertainty in the coordinate transform are found to be reduced under 10; the number is about one-fourth of the necessary passes for the same convergence in case of <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> point-positioning.

SA error is examined for point positioning and dynamic orbit determination for an orbiting user. To minimize SA error, nondifferential users have several options: expand their field of view; observe as many GPS satellites as possible; smooth the error over time; and employ precise GPS ephemerides computed independently, as by NASA and the NGS, rather than the <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris.</b> Simulations show that 3 D point position error can be kept to 30 m, and this can be smoothed to 3 m in a few hours...|$|R

Additional static GPS measurements were obtained with the TI 4100 receiver at a reference site established to support the experiment. A third data set was collected after activation of Selective Availability. Measurements collected with the TI 4100, Trimble and Ashtech receivers were subsequently processed with GASP using broadcast and precise ephemerides to product point position estimates. In order for GASP to accept the data from the Ashtech and Trimble receivers, the program had to be modified. The positioning results are analyzed for accuracy and precision. the accuracy of the GASP GPS estimates is determined by the comparison to independent estimates obtained by the Transit Doppler positioning system.

30|$|Since {{the short}} {{baselines}} are used (Table 1) in GNSS data processing, the satellite-dependent terms, such as satellite clock offsets, and carrier phase fractional biases, the distance-dependent terms, such as tropospheric and ionospheric delay, and satellite orbit errors could be neglected in double-difference (Breuer et al. 2015; Górski, 2017). Thus, {{there are only}} coordinate parameters and double-difference ambiguity parameters left in the parameter list to be estimated. For the purpose of fast ambiguity fixing, dual-frequency phase observations are used. The unknown parameters are estimated by a Kalman filter, and the coordinate parameters with float ambiguities can be obtained. Then the LAMBDA method will be applied to obtain the ambiguity fixed resolutions. During the data processing, the <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> was {{used to calculate the}} orbit of satellites. The elevation cutoff angle was set to 10 °, and the elevation related stochastic model was used for weighting the random observation errors.|$|R
40|$|Classically a {{stand-alone}} GNSS receiver estimates its velocity by forming the approximate derivative of consecutive user positions or more often {{by using the}} Doppler observable. The first method is very inaccurate, while the second one allows estimation {{of the order of}} some cm/s. The TDCP (Time-Differenced Carrier Phase) technique, which consists in differencing successive carrier phases, enables accuracies at the mm/s level. A study on the existing TDCP velocity estimation algorithms has revealed that the use of different <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> sets to calculate the satellite positions and clock offsets produces a discontinuity in the TDCP measurements that affects the velocity estimation. We propose a method to overcome this limitation based {{on the use of the}} same set of ephemeris to calculate the satellite positions and clock offsets at consecutive epochs. We describe in detail the TDCP algorithm used and the complete implementation in MATLAB is included...|$|R

By comparing precise orbits to <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> for each individual GPS and Galileo satellite, this work computes the Signal-in-Space Range Error (SISRE) {{that needs to be}} overbounded by the URA/SISA value included in the Integrity Support Message (ISM). Service data from January 2008 to February 2015 for GPS and from March to June 2015 for Galileo are processed, showing that range error is mainly driven by satellite's clock performance. In order for the ISM generation to account for the variation in error biases and standard deviation, GPS service history is broken down into monthly, quarterly, and yearly datasets. Results reveal that orbit and clock error distributions are non-zero mean on a monthly basis, although biases tend to reduce as sample set size increases...|$|R

The suitability of SBAS for navigation in geostationary orbits (GEO), where SBAS satellites may be permanently in view, was assessed. The analysis revealed that all tracked SBAS transmit enough power to be tracked over Earth’s limb. GAGAN has the narrowest gain pattern, WAAS has a similar pattern to EGNOS but a 2 – 4 dB higher transmit power, and MSAS has the lowest signal power but more even global coverage, with stronger power transmitted towards {{the edge of the}} Earth. SBAS ranging typically agrees with GPS single-point positions to within +/- 10 m for WAAS and +/- 20 m for MSAS and GAGAN. It was determined that the SBAS ranging capability is useable in GEO and other high orbits, provided that fast correction data are applied to the <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris,</b> and the lower accuracies are accounted fo...|$|R

It shows the experimental verification {{for the type}} A 1 ephemeris threat monitor (after-maneuver validation) and initial results for an ionospheric threat monitor for a static storm. It starts by describing in detail the carrier phase performance of the Integrated Multipath Limiting Antennas (IMLA’s), including an assessment of differential phase pattern variations with respect to azimuth and elevation. It also defines the mathematical model developed for differential phase variation, explains its use in precise antenna calibration, and demonstrates that the resulting IMLA double difference carrier phase errors have {{a standard deviation of}} less than 3 mm. Finally, the calibrated double difference carrier phase measurements are used toward the detection of the ephemeris and ionospheric front anomalies. The integrity performance of the LGF SIS monitor functions is quantified analytically and by simulation, and verified experimentally by deliberately injecting failures into the <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> or the raw LTP data...|$|R

In this paper, a constellation constituted by 24 MEO+ 5 GEO+ 3 IGSO was simulated considering {{the characteristics of the}} second generation of BD (COMPASS), then corresponding simulated combined orbit resolution has been done using this kind of constellation. We implemented analyses from aspects of different ground station number and geographical distribution to investigate their influence on combined orbit determination (COD). Results show that well-distributed stations around the world do a little better orbit determination performance than that with stations of regional distribution in China. Besides, accuracy could be slightly better than precision of <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> only using just one station inside our country. Nevertheless, {{increase in the number of}} stations could not significantly improve the COD accuracy when all stations are located regionally at home, however, it could enhance the stability and reliability of the navigation system...|$|R

40|$|With the {{availability}} of Galileo signals from four in-orbit validation (IOV) satellites, positioning with Galileo-only observations has become possible, which allows us to assess its positioning performance. The performance of the Galileo system is evaluated in respect of carrier-to-noise density ratio (C/N 0), pseudorange multipath (including noise), Galileo broadcast satellite orbit and satellite clock errors, and single point positioning (SPP) accuracy in Galileo-only mode {{as well as in}} GPS/Galileo combined mode. The precision of the <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> data is assessed using the precise satellite orbit and clock products from the Institute of Astronomical and Physical Geodesy of the Technische Universität München (IAPG/TUM) as references. The GPS-Galileo time offset (GGTO) is estimated using datasets from different types of GNSS receivers and the results indicate that a systematic bias exists between different receiver types. Positioning solutions indicate that Galileo-only SPP can achieve a three-dimensional position accuracy of about six metres. The integration of Galileo and GPS data can improve the positioning accuracies by about 10 % in the vertical components compared with GPS-only solutions.

40|$|The Ground based Augmentation System (GBAS) {{is being}} {{developed}} to enable precision approach and landing operations using the Global Positioning System (GPS). Each GBAS installation provides services through a GBAS Ground Facility (GGF) which {{is located at the}} airport it serves. By monitoring the GPS signals, measurements, and navigation messages, the GGF is able to exclude unhealthy satellites and broadcast real-time range correction messages for healthy satellites to users via a VHF data link. Airborne users apply these corrections to remove errors that are common between the GGF and the aircraft. The GGF is also responsible for warning the aircraft of any potential integrity threats. One source of potential errors is the satellite <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> message, which users decode and use to compute GPS satellite positions. In GBAS, potential GPS ephemeris faults are categorized into two types, A and B, based upon whether or not the fault is associated with a satellite manoeuvre. Both type A and type B events can cause differential ranging errors. However, the ramifications of these failure classes differ in both likelihood of occurrence and means of detection. The likelihood of type B failures is relatively higher than type A because orbit <b>ephemeris</b> uploads and <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> changeovers are frequent (nominally once per day and once every 2 h, respectively, for each satellite), whereas spacecraft manoeuvres are rare (no more than once or twice per year). This work focuses on aviation navigation threats caused by Type B faults for Category I (Cat-I) aircraft Precision Approach (PA). To detect and mitigate these threats, we investigate GGF monitors based on comparing projected satellite position estimates based on Zero-Order and First-Order Hold (ZOH, FOH) estimators, using prior days of data. Objectives: &# 8722; Background literature review to know the state of the Art. &# 8722; To develop algorithms to linearly compute projected satellite estimated based on a prior day (ZOH) or two prior days (FOH) of data. &# 8722; To define a statistical test for Type B anomalies detection, assuming a missed detection probability (MD) of 1 E- 3 and Fault Free Alarm (FFA) probability of 1. 9 E- 4, according with CAT-I PA requirements of RTCA/MOPS. &# 8722; To determine the covariance matrix of fault-free GPS broadcast orbit errors distribution. &# 8722; To determine the Minimum detectable Error (MDE) and Ephemeris decorrelation parameter (P-value). &# 8722; To select a candidate for a GBAS Type B orbit errors monitor for Cat-I PA operations...|$|R

40|$|Global {{navigation}} satellite systems like GPS, GLONASS or the future systems like Galileo require precise orbit and clock estimates {{in order to}} provide high positioning performance. Within the frame of this Ph. D. thesis, the theory of orbit determination and orbit computation is reviewed and a new approach for precise orbit and ephemeris determination using intersatellite links is developed. To investigate the achievable accuracy, models of the various perturbing forces acting on a satellite have been elaborated and coded in a complex software package, allowing system level performance analysis as well as detailed evaluation of orbit prediction and orbit estimation algorithms. Several satellite constellations have been simulated, involving nearly all classes of orbit altitude and the results are compared. The purpose of orbit determination in a satellite navigation system is the derivation of ephemeris parameters which can be broadcast to the user community (or the other satellites) and allow easy computation of the satellites position at the desired epoch. The <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> model of both today existing satellite navigation systems, GPS and GLONASS are investigated, as well as two new models developed within this thesis, which are derivates o...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a nominal range error analysis to support ARAIM {{based on a}} statistical study of orbit and clock errors observations for Galileo F-NAV Open Service. Nominal range error {{is characterized by the}} so-called Signal-in-Space Range Error (SISRE) which is computed by comparing precise reference orbits to <b>broadcast</b> <b>ephemeris</b> for each individual satellite. This work processes Galileo constellation service data from March 2015 to July 2016 accounting for the progressive satellite addition during the constellation expansion. Given the undergoing maturation of the Galileo ground segment along with the pending declaration of the Full Operational Capability, the nominality of the error is assessed by disregarding the 1 % of the worst-case samples. Results will address the differences in the nominal range error performance among Galileo satellites highlighting their clear dependence on the satellite clock error behavior. Furthermore, this work evaluates on a monthly basis the evolution of error performance throughout the monitoring period showing a substantial enhancement in the past months in nominal range error. Results advocate for flexible overbounding values contained in the Integrity Support Message (ISM) that are able adapt throughout the constellation evolution along its deployment (i. e. monthly update rate as proposed by Online Architecture) ...|$|R
