5|$|Around 23:00 on 15 August, {{elements}} of the Serbian 1st Combined Division encountered outposts {{set up by the}} invading Austro-Hungarian army on the slopes of Cer Mountain and fighting erupted. The Austro-Hungarian positions were lightly held, and their defenders were driven <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mountain. By midnight, fierce clashes between the Austro-Hungarians and the Serbs were underway and chaos ensued in the darkness. By the morning of 16 August, the Serbians had seized the Divača Range and dislodged the Austro-Hungarians from their positions in the village of Borino Selo. The Austro-Hungarians, who had suffered heavy casualties during the fighting, retreated in some disorder. As the day progressed, the Serbs drove the 21st Infantry Division off the slopes of Cer to prevent it from linking with the 2nd Army in Šabac.|$|E

500|$|Described by the {{developers}} {{as a modern}} version of Gauntlet, The Return of the King is a hack and slash action game played from a third-person perspective. The game {{is very similar to}} its [...] in basic gameplay.

Only fierce attacks can break enemy shields. Each character also has a ranged attack, a [...] "killing move" [...] (which can be used to instantly kill downed enemies), a parry (which can deflect enemy attacks), a knock back (which pushes nearby enemies away), a jump back (in which the player character jumps <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> enemy), a devastating attack (a charged fierce attack) and a special ability. Playable characters in the console and PC versions are Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Frodo and Sam, with Faramir, Pippin and Merry available as unlockable characters.

500|$|It was {{intended}} that Yardley would appear lower {{down in the}} batting order, batting with a substantial total accumulated by the previous batsmen. However, the frailties of the England batting meant he often appeared in a crisis and had to rebuild several innings. Bill Bowes, the Yorkshire and England bowler who covered the tour as a journalist, was impressed by Yardley's approach, noting {{that he did not}} <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fast bowlers, who frequently bowled bouncers at him: [...] "In fact, Yardley played cricket with a determination we had never seen in Yorkshire or in his days at the university." [...] He made the greatest impression as a bowler, surprising commentators with his effectiveness. He did not bowl in the first six matches, but in his first over of the tour dismissed Arthur Morris who had already scored a century. From that point, he was used effectively to break up partnerships. In the Tests, he removed Donald Bradman in three successive innings, while in the third Test, he took two wickets, including Bradman, in two deliveries. Bowes believed the natural length of Yardley's bowling was perfect for Australian pitches—he was not skilful enough to alter the length at which he bowled so his bowling in other conditions was less effective. The Australian reporter Clif Cary wrote [...] "It was always amusing to watch the Englishmen when Yardley took a wicket. The first time they seemed fairly amused, but when he was regularly breaking partnerships, their enthusiasm knew no bounds, and it is said that in Melbourne after he had obtained Bradman's wicket for the third time, Yardley blushed profusely when one excited team-mate slapped him on the back and shouted [...] "Well, bowled, Spofforth".|$|E

[...] Others, such as Fama, said that the hypothesis held up well during the crisis and that the markets were a casualty of the recession, not the cause of it. Despite this, Fama has conceded that [...] "poorly informed investors could theoretically lead the market astray" [...] and that stock prices could become [...] "somewhat irrational" [...] as a result.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{all three}} {{characters}} have different weapons and combos, their basic fighting style is the same.
