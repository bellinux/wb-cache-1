500|$|Originally {{developed}} in 1997, the EZpay system was born {{as a pilot}} project aimed at inductees going into basic training, to alleviate some of the stress and cost of managing money while away from home. Many U.S. military bases are structured like small towns, where goods and services are available for sale. However, transferring wages into cash, in order to purchase desired products has traditionally <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>struggle.</b> [...] The system works through soldiers receiving an advance on their wages {{in the form of}} the EZPay card, which they can then use to purchase goods and services, such as haircuts, snacks, and recreational activities at on-base shops and stores. [...] At the end of basic training, the balance on the card would be reconverted into cash, and paid back to the soldiers. [...] The project was a great success, since it eliminated the need for bases to keep money on hand, and saved soldiers approximately $125,000 a year in banking fees.|$|E
500|$|Oklahoma! had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> {{to finance}} and produce. [...] Hammerstein and Rodgers met weekly in 1943 with Theresa Helburn and Lawrence Langner of the Theatre Guild, {{producers}} of the blockbuster musical, who together formed what they termed [...] "the Gloat Club". [...] At one such luncheon, Helburn and Langner proposed to Rodgers and Hammerstein that they turn Molnár's Liliom into a musical. [...] Both men refused—they had no feeling for the Budapest setting and thought that the unhappy ending was unsuitable for musical theatre. [...] In addition, given the unstable wartime political situation, they might {{need to change the}} setting from Hungary while in rehearsal. [...] At the next luncheon, Helburn and Langner again proposed Liliom, suggesting that they move the setting to Louisiana and make Liliom a Creole. [...] Rodgers and Hammerstein played with the idea over the next few weeks, but decided that Creole dialect, filled with [...] "zis" [...] and [...] "zose" [...] would sound corny and would make it difficult to write effective lyrics.|$|E

Rasmussen had been six feet (...) tall, larger than some men and many women, and in good physical shape. It would have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> for anyone to subdue her in close quarters, and Mayer had told him at one point that the events may have lasted an hour and a half, a long time for burglars primarily after items of value in the home. Further, whoever shot his daughter had fired directly into her chest at close range and taken the trouble to muffle the shot with the quilt, suggesting that the killing was deliberate and not the accidental byproduct of a struggle.|$|E
2500|$|On 31 October 1969, 29-year-old Helen Puttock {{was found}} murdered in Earl Street in Scotstoun. She {{had also been}} to the Barrowland Ballroom on the night she was murdered; she had gone there with her sister, Jean, and had met two men called John. One said he was from Castlemilk while the other did not {{disclose}} where he was from. After being in their company for well over an hour, they left to head home. Castlemilk John walked to George Square to get a bus, while Helen, Jean and the killer hailed a taxi. They set off from Glasgow Cross and made a westward journey heading to Knightswood where Jean lived. It was during this journey {{that most of the}} crucial information about the killer became apparent. More significant were the conversations in the taxi that would later be used to create a psychological profile of the killer. Jean told detectives that he was a well-spoken man who quoted from the Bible. It was this information that led to the killer being given the nickname [...] "Bible John" [...] by the media. After dropping off Jean at Knightswood, the taxi then continued to Earl Street in Scotstoun where Helen lived. The next morning, Helen's battered body was found in the back garden of her flat in Earl Street. She had been raped and strangled. The contents of her handbag had been scattered nearby but the actual bag was missing. It has been suggested that the killer took the bag as a trophy. Grass stains on Helen's feet indicated that there had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> in which Helen probably tried to escape her killer. She also had a deep bite mark on her leg.|$|E

Keeping store in a wheat-growing {{district}} was not a simple matter of selling groceries; one was in reality a banker. Bills were not often paid until the crop was harvested, farmers began without much money, and one must know whom to trust. Indeed, one often financed a hustler who had no capital, and kept an honest man who had lost a crop on his feet; but the risk was great, and one felt the strain when there was rust and autumn frost.|$|E
6000|$|The {{great war}} between the Northern and Southern States of America [...] has the special {{interest}} for English boys of having <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> [...] between two sections of a people akin to us in race and language--a [...] struggle fought out by each side with unusual intensity of [...] conviction in the rightness of its cause, and abounding in heroic [...] incidents.

It looked as if nobody but the men who had attacked him knew there had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> and he was left behind. Then he cautiously raised his head and leaning on his elbow looked about. It was a relief to find that he could do so, but he must see if his antagonist had fallen off with him, because if the fellow was not badly hurt he might renew the attack.|$|E

6000|$|The {{kings and}} princes disliked this {{alienation}} of property very greatly. In the place of feudal lords capable of military support, they found their land supporting abbeys and monks and nuns. And these lands were really under foreign dominion. Even before the time of Pope Gregory VII there had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> between the princes and the papacy over the question of [...] "investitures," [...] the question that is of who should appoint the bishops. If that power rested with the Pope and not the King, then the latter lost control {{not only of the}} consciences of his subjects but of a considerable part of his dominions. For also the clergy claimed exemption from taxation. They paid their taxes to Rome. And not only that, but the church also claimed the right to levy a tax of one-tenth upon the property of the layman in addition to the taxes he paid his prince.|$|E

It worried her that they never saved any money: try as she would to cut the expenses down, there was a limit of decency; New England thrift, hitherto justly celebrated, was put to shame by that which the foreigners displayed, and which would have delighted the souls of gentlemen of the Manchester school. Every once in a while there rose up before her fabulous instances of this thrift, of Italians and Jews who, ignorant emigrants, had entered the mills only a few years before they, the Bumpuses, had come to Hampton, and were now independent property owners. Still rankling in Hannah's memory was a day when Lise had returned from school, dark and mutinous, with a tale of such a family. One of the younger children was a classmate.|$|E
60|$|It had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>struggle,</b> {{with both}} of them, to decide upon telling an untruth. This is a point upon which {{differences}} of opinion must always arise. Some will assert that under no circumstances can a falsehood be justified. Others will say that to deceive an enemy in war, or to save life, deceit is justifiable, especially when that deceit injures no one. It was only after very great hesitation that the boys had overcome their natural instincts and teaching, and agreed to conceal their nationality under false colors Ned, indeed, held out for a long time; but Tom had cited many examples, from ancient and modern history, showing that people of all nations had, to deceive an enemy, adopted such a course; and that to throw away their lives, rather than tell a falsehood which could hurt no one, would {{be an act of}} folly. Both, however, determined that, should it become necessary to keep up their character as Spaniards by pretending to be true Catholics, they would disclose the truth.|$|E

The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though there had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>struggle,</b> and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt.
