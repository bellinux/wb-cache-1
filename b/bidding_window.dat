In a sequential bidding auction the round moves forward immediately after a bid was submitted. In a multiple round auction, the round moves forward only after all players have submitted their action. Under {{the assumption that}} the bidders may either have a low value or a high value for the object, I show that multiple equilibria, with relevantly different characteristics, may arise under either rule. Moreover, the rule that maximizes the sellerâ€™s revenue depends on the the probability of a high value bidder...|$|E

The rise in the water on the previous night had been almost imperceptible. Feeling, therefore, somewhat easier in his mind, old Mr Ravenshaw determined to embark in his boat for the purpose of paying a visit to those unfortunates who, after being driven from their homes, had taken refuge on the imperceptible eminence which had been styled [...] "The Mountain." [...] Taking with him Lambert and a stout crew, he embarked from his upper bedroom <b>window,</b> <b>bade</b> his wife and daughters an affectionate adieu, hoisted his sail, and pushed off.|$|R

The landlady {{went back to her}} kitchen, and the young painter stood, as if he were waiting for something, beside the gate which opened upon the path across the fields. Longmore sat {{brooding}} and asking himself if it weren't probably better to cultivate the arts than to cultivate the passions. Before he had answered the question the painter had grown tired of waiting. He had picked up a pebble, tossed it lightly into an upper window and called familiarly [...] "Claudine!" [...] Claudine appeared; Longmore heard her at the <b>window,</b> <b>bidding</b> the young man cultivate patience. [...] "But I'm losing my light," [...] he said; [...] "I must have my shadows in the same place as yesterday." ...|$|R
