The following empirical analysis evaluates the forecasting quality of medium-term financial planing with regard to expenditures, taxes, and deficits. A model is tested that relates forecast budgetary trends to economic, institutional, and political-economic factors. Current financial planning is shown to be ineffective in making budgetary policy more predictable. Rather than promoting more credible and binding projections, the Maastricht Treaty appears to have encouraged even less realistic budgetary planning and overoptimistic financial projections in Germany. The policy conclusion suggests that responsibility for fiscal forecasts may need to be transferred to an independent institution.

40|$|Real‐time {{estimates}} of potential output {{are used for}} the calculation of the cyclically adjusted budget balance, {{one of the main}} indicators in the assessment of the fiscal performance of EU member states. The estimation of potential output involves a decomposition of actual output into a cyclical and a structural component based on arbitrary assumptions about the statistical properties of the two unobserved components. With a very high degree of smoothing, variations in GDP are mostly taken to be temporary, as are the ensuing changes in the budget deficit. Conversely, with a low degree of smoothing, variations in GDP are mostly taken to be permanent, leading to different policy conclusions. Our paper examines whether and how different potential output estimates would have supported different decisions in the EU budgetary surveillance in terms of both timing and substance. The results show that only a very high degree of smoothing of potential output would significantly reduce the reliability of the surveillance indicators. We conclude that a higher degree of smoothing compared with current practice would not be harmful for EU fiscal surveillance, while it could contribute to more cautious policies by signalling larger and longer periods of economic ‘good times’. potential output, cyclical adjustment, EU <b>budgetary</b> surveillance, <b>Stability</b> and Growth Pact, Excessive Deficit Procedure, safety margin, minimum benchmark, fiscal surveillance indicators,...|$|R

40|$|In {{countries}} where subnational governments control {{a large part}} of the public finances, the central government's ability to keep its commitment to the European Union's Stability and Growth Pact can be a difficult matter. European rules demand that the overall budget be balanced over the medium term; applying this rule at subcentral level may unduly reduce capital outlays and local budgetary autonomy. This article examines the possible impact of <b>budgetary</b> <b>stability</b> legislation on the capital expenditure of Spanish municipalities. The empirical findings suggest that the new <b>budgetary</b> <b>stability</b> framework will oblige municipalities to (i) limit their investments, (ii) raise the tax burden, or (iii) reduce the funds allocated to other budget items.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze how the {{implementation}} of the <b>Budgetary</b> <b>Stability</b> Law has affected Political Budget Cycles generated by Spanish local governments. Specifically, we study whether the evolution of debt, budget deficit, capital spending and current spending over the electoral cycle has changed after the introduction of this law. We use a sample of 132 Spanish municipalities with more than 50, 000 inhabitants (including the provincial capitals) during the period 1995 – 2009. Our results show that the <b>Budgetary</b> <b>Stability</b> Law has avoided electoral cycles in debt. On the contrary, the adoption of this law has not mitigated the incumbents’ incentives to manipulate deficit, capital spending and current spending with electoral aims. Nevertheless, it has caused a change in the way in which mayors manipulate fiscal policy over the electoral cycle. The opportunistic expansion covered both preelectoral year and the electoral year before the implementation of this fiscal rule, while after that, deficit and spending increases are confined in the election year...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the position}} of social work in relation to world poverty by examining {{the implications of the}} integration of the world economy (globalization) for the organization and practice of the profession. In the first three quarters of the 20 th century, social work was associa-ted with the political movement for equality and social justice through state intervention and social protection. Even in countries where social work was primarily the province of voluntary organizations, it was strongly integrated with public services for health, education and income maintenance. During the economic restructuring and reform of state agencies which has taken place since the mid- 1970 s, all this has changed. Under the Washington Consensus {{on the development of the}} world economy, which reflected the principles of the neo-liberal governments of Ronald Reagan in the USA and Margaret Thatcher in the UK, the international agencies responsible for global credit and trade (IMF, World Bank and World Trade Organization) imposed a different logic on governments from outside the club of affluent, capitalist nations. They demanded financial <b>stability,</b> <b>budgetary</b> restraint and pro- market reforms, and required the restructuring of public sectors (Jordan, 2006). Between 1980 and 2000, while this regime held sway, the outstand-ing feature of social and economic change worldwide was the variation in the fortunes of different sections of the global population.

40|$|This paper aims {{to analyse}} the {{constitutional}} and legal limits {{which have been}} established with regards to <b>budgetary</b> <b>stability</b> and financial sustainability and their possible application to the Spanish autonomous communities. The starting point is the allocation of financial autonomy that is enshrined in Article 156 (Spanish Constitution), but we also examine aspects of other provisions that may demarcate this financial autonomy in some way. In particular,Article 135 (Spanish Constitution), which in its amendment put asevere limitation on public spending, articulated through {{the concept of a}} permitted public deficit, and which also put in place the mechanisms to achieve this.

40|$|This thesis explores {{some of the}} {{processes}} involved in the transformation of a university as it moved from a conventional collegial style of decision-making towards a more corporate one. Much of the mainstream literature in higher education management tends to polarise these styles as ideological opposites and as either good or bad. The themes which arise in this work include the tension which exists between collegial and managerial values, co-evolution of these values through processes of interaction within the organisation and the modulation of these processes by changing power relations. For centuries, universities were administered by academics who reached senior positions following election by their colleagues and who behaved as ???first among equals???. Ideally, the community of scholars made progress following decisions which were reached by consensus. While such processes were appropriate in times when <b>stability,</b> <b>budgetary</b> certainty {{and the absence of}} competition prevailed, their shortcomings became increasingly obvious in the past quarter-century when the external environment for universities became progressively more hostile and competitive. Universities responded to the new requirements for accountability, revenue generation and competitive positioning within a market system by reforming their approach to many aspects of the running of their organisations. I argue that in importing a way of thinking which is largely based on cybernetic control systems, inadequate account has been taken of the importance of human interaction in the generation of strategy. While mention is made in the mainstream higher education management literature of the importance of collegial processes in implementing strategy at the academic coalface, and regret is expressed for the ???lost art of conversation???, there has been little previously written about the microscopic details of the daily interaction which constitute strategising in universities. My argument is based on a series of reflexive narratives which describe my experience of organisational change and on a study of relevant literature. In addition to mainstream literature on higher education management, I have drawn on the work of Stacey, Griffin and Shaw and their perspective of complex responsive processes of relating as a way of understanding how organisations change. I conclude that collegial and managerial values can only evolve through processes of interaction between participants in university life and that this interaction often will involve tension, anxiety and conflict. I further conclude that the conversations which constitute such interaction can be facilitated by those with the power to do so, to provide real opportunity for the emergence of novelty...|$|R

40|$|The {{emerging}} information-based economy {{requires an}} educated and skilled labor force. Unfortunately this caliber of human resource is insufficient in South Africa. This {{is in part}} due to the historical experience of the apartheid educational system, which stifled human capital development among generations of South Africans. Despite commendable efforts of the government to meet the increasing demand for education in the country, the gap in education, coupled with the need for trained and skilled work force, cannot be met only by the state through the traditional approach of educational delivery. Rather, the involvement of all stakeholders and approaches, especially the private sector and the employment of information and communication technologies (ICTs 1) in curriculum delivery are essential. This study argues that the use of ICTs to improve secondary education in South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa in general should not wait until countries in the region reach a certain level of economic growth and <b>budgetary</b> <b>stability.</b> Rather, governments in the region should use the right economic and political incentives to encourage the involvement of the private sector in the advancement of secondary education through ICTs.

In the opinion of Al-Shemmeri, Al-Kloub and Rearman (1997), this method is the most adequate one because of the following advantages: public authorities, as decision takers, can understand easily the results, regardless the knowledge they may have about it; the method uses understandable economic parameters; the method avoids distorting scale effects among different alternatives and, as well, makes possible the deviation evaluation between alternatives and, finally, allows for sensibility analysis. ...|$|E
40|$|Public debt has {{traditionally}} been explained mainly by two political factors: a progressive ideology and the electoral cycle. The aim {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate how these two factors influence the behavior of Spanish local governments as regards indebtedness, and also how indebtedness is influenced by the interaction of ideology and the electoral cycle. Different dependence models were estimated using panel data methodology based on a sample comprised of Spanish provincial capitals and towns with populations over 50, 000, for a total of 148 town councils. The time frame corresponds to the fiscal years 1988 to 2008, inclusive. The results show that in an electoral year all politicians behave opportunistically, giving rise to an important increase in public debt in relation to municipal revenue, although progressive incumbents incur three times more debt than those of the opposite ideology. Moreover, the presence of conservative parties in government has tended to significantly attenuate this behavior in years prior to elections, whereas progressive or left-wing parties have not. It must also be noted that partisan and electoral business cycles have been mitigated since 2002, when the <b>Budgetary</b> <b>Stability</b> Law came into effect, imposing limits on the debt of subnational administrations. The empirical evidence obtained points to the need to perfect internal and external control mechanisms in order to avoid a breakdown in the stability policy and the risk of debt becoming untenable, thus achieving greater budgetary discipline...|$|E
40|$|The author {{analyzes}} {{the decisions of}} the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia regarding citizen-initiated referenda, adopted in the period between 2013 and 2015. From the referendum on the definition of marriage, through the Court’s ruling on the referendum on the Cyrillic script, to the most recent cases dealing with outsourcing in the public administration and monetization of Croatian highways, she outlines a trend of growing limitations to the popular referendum institute. Paying particular attention to the decision on outsourcing from 8 April 2015, she highlights the problem areas of constitutional jurisprudence and suggests their corrections. Regarding the cogent nature of the obligation to substantiate the initiative with a statement of circumstances that provoked it, she holds that question as falling in the area of legislative discretion. Regarding the “premature nature” of an initiative, she argues that the Court may not tie its destiny to the existence of a Government’s program not yet formalized as a concrete bill. It also cannot clairvoyantly assess the impact of a referendum on the system of public finances. In balancing the right to referendum with <b>budgetary</b> <b>stability,</b> it may only take account of foreseeable consequences and measurable data, and withhold the right to referendum only in cases of decisions whose impact on the state’s fiscal stability would violate the guarantees of the Constitution’s Arts. 3 and 16. Finally, she concludes on the impermissibility of applying stricter scrutiny to citizen-initiated referenda then to identical texts adopted by the Croatian Parliament. She holds such escalation of standards of review untenable in the light of a grammatical and teleological interpretation of the Constitution, as well as due to its punitive effect...|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} stages of the crisis that is {{currently}} affecting the Spanish economy, the fiscal policy that excessively re-sorted to automatic stabilizers helped overwhelm the deficit and public debt. In this context, first, in this paper we ana-lyse the trend and variation rate of government revenue as well as expenditure on final consumption and government investment in the last 15 years in relation to the business cycle. In another vein, we also explore and quantify the impact of the countercyclical policies provided from 2007 to 2010 and their impact on the tax burden, which enables us to evaluate the stabilizing role of fiscal policy and thus highlight its fragility. Second, given the challenges of <b>budgetary</b> <b>stability</b> facing the Spanish economy, and always based on the above analysis in which we display the limited room for fiscal manoeuvre, we present the effects of aggregate public spending in a systematic and quantified way as well as its composition as an instrument of fiscal policy. In this framework, a long term stable equilibrium relationship is studied, based on two bivariate models that cointegrate econometrically, that is to say, to estimate models for error correction for cointegrated nonstationary series (and ultimately able to anticipate the evolution of the Spanish economy), we estimate and assess the contribution of spending on investment and government final consumption on aggregate output as well as its differential effect, to assess the concrete impact of the measures applied and ultimately the role of fiscal policy im-plemented in the early years of the crisis and those that will be designed in the future. Finally, the main conclusion given by the model of behaviour for the final consumption expenditure of general government and GDP, is the exis-tence of delayed adverse effects on the rate of growth of public spending on growth rate GDP. Taking into account the response function of GDP for a boost in public consumption, we estimate that with a lag of two years, an increase in the growth rate of public consumption is falling in the rates of change of aggregate output. Moreover, we can also deduce that the delayed effects of the rate of decline in public investment have a negative impact on economic growth...|$|E
