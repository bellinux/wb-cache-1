5|$|Departure from Beirut {{was delayed}} by about one hour. Originally {{scheduled}} to depart at 05:45, take-off took place only at 06:01. Less than 15 minutes later, two Arab passengers threatened to <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> aircraft using explosives {{that had been}} hidden in the first class cabin (and which likely had been smuggled there in Damascus) if the members of Black September were not released from the German prison.|$|E
5|$|Smith and Seguin {{confirmed}} {{the fate of}} the mission upon their return. Houston dispatched orders to Fannin to abandon Goliad, <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Presidio La Bahía fortress, and retreat to Victoria, but Fannin delayed acting on those orders. Believing the approach of Urrea's troops brought a greater urgency to local civilians, he sent 29 men under Captain Amon B. King to help evacuate nearby Refugio.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to files}} {{recovered}} by Fisher in London (and made public by the president), the American public and Congress both believe that Iran is funding the Blacklist, and The United States and Iran are headed towards war. Looking for more solid proof of Iran's involvement, Fisher infiltrates Quds Force headquarters in Tehran(previously a U.S embassy). Inside, he discovers that Iran {{has nothing to}} do with the Blacklist, and that the files he recovered were planted by The Engineers in order to lure The United States into a war. Fisher narrowly escapes Tehran by using a Predator Drone to <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Iranian vehicles chasing him, causing an international incident.|$|E

After retrieving the Sunfire, a weapon which can <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Dreadnought, they watch helplessly as an airship with Hilda on board is captured by the Dreadnought. When the Dreadnought lands to stock up on supplies, the party rescues Hilda and throws the Sunfire into the airship's engine. Before escaping from the explosion, the party encounters a dark knight whom Maria thinks she recognizes as Leon.|$|E
5|$|In Dead or Alive 4 (2005), Ayane {{has pledged}} {{her life to}} her {{half-brother}} and Mugen Tenshin clan leader Hayate, in his cause to destroy the DOATEC for the suffering the company has caused the ninja clans. Ayane has a threefold stake in this plot: she wants revenge for Raidou being changed into a monster, for Hayate being brainwashed {{in their attempt to}} realize Project Epsilon, and for the manipulation and death of Genra. At the end of the game, Ayane uses her ninpo ("ninja arts") spell to <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> DOATEC Tri-Tower.|$|E
5|$|In February 1973 Abu Daoud {{was arrested}} in Jordan for an attempt on King Hussein's life. This led to Abu Nidal's first operation, using the name Al-Iqab ("the Punishment"); on 5 September 1973 five gunmen entered the Saudi embassy in Paris, took 15 hostages and {{threatened}} to <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> building if Abu Daoud was not released. The gunmen flew two days later to Kuwait on a Syrian Airways flight, still holding five hostages, then to Riyadh, threatening to throw the hostages out of the aircraft. They surrendered and released the hostages on 8 September. Abu Daoud {{was released from prison}} two weeks later; Seale writes that the Kuwaiti government paid King Hussein $12 million for his release.|$|E

Alan and Tequila meet up again and are confronted by Wong, who has set bombs to <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> building. Alan pursues Wong as Tequila escapes the hospital with the last baby, the hospital exploding around him. Outside, Wong suddenly appears holding Alan at gunpoint. After watching Wong humiliate Tequila, Alan grabs Wong's pistol. In a struggle, Alan shoots himself through the stomach giving Tequila enough time to shoot Wong dead. Later at the police station, Pang and Tequila burn Alan's police file. Alan then sails away from Hong Kong in his boat.|$|E
5|$|The Commandos {{were divided}} into three groups: One and Two would travel in the MLs, while Three would be in Campbeltown. Under the command of Captain Hodgeson, Group One had the {{objectives}} of securing the Old Mole and eliminating the anti-aircraft gun positions around the southern quays. They were then {{to move into the}} old town and <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> power station, bridges and locks for the new entrance into the basin from the Avant port. The capture of the mole was a major objective, as it was to be the embarkation point for the evacuation after the mission.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} {{ultimately}} decided when {{the rising tide}} lifted Rhett's sloops free while temporarily leaving the Royal James stranded. Bonnet was left helpless, watching while the enemy vessels repaired their rigging and closed to board his paralysed vessel. Outnumbered almost three to one, Bonnet's men would have had little hope of winning a boarding action. Bonnet ordered his gunner, George Ross, to <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Royal James's powder magazine. Ross apparently attempted this, but was overruled by {{the remainder of the}} crew, who surrendered. Rhett arrested the pirates and returned to Charles Town with his prisoners on 3October.|$|E

5|$|After Houston {{received}} word that Santa Anna was leading a large force to San Antonio, Bowie offered to lead volunteers {{to defend the}} Alamo from the expected attack. He arrived with 30men on January 19, where they found a force of 104men with a few weapons and a few cannons, but not many supplies and little gunpowder. Houston {{knew that there were}} not enough men to hold the fort in an attack and had given Bowie authority to remove the artillery and <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> fortification. Bowie and the Alamo commander, James C. Neill, decided they did not have enough oxen to move the artillery, and {{they did not want to}} destroy the fortress. On January 26, one of Bowie's men, James Bonham, organized a rally which passed a resolution in favor of holding the Alamo. Bonham signed the resolution first, with Bowie's signature second.|$|E
5|$|After Keen finds Molly tied up at {{the back}} of the Bloog Control Center on the space station, she {{explains}} to him that she was kidnapped on the orders of her younger brother, who Keen knows to be his nemesis Mortimer McMire. Mortimer convinced the Bloogs to kidnap her by offering them the Stupendous Sandwich of Chungella IV. Keen is surprised, as he thought Mortimer was dead (he was apparently killed at the end of the Vorticon trilogy), and is dismayed to find out that Mortimer plans to <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> entire universe. This conclusion is also revealed in an encoded note at the end of the Galaxy. The game ends by asking the player to play the next installment, where Keen would again fight Mortimer.|$|E
5|$|After announcing Gotham will {{be subject}} to his rule come nightfall, the Joker rigs two {{evacuating}} ferries with explosives; one containing civilians and the other containing prisoners. He says that he will blow them both up by midnight, but will let one live if its passengers (who have been supplied the trigger to the other boat's explosives) <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> other. Batman finds the Joker with a sonar device that spies on the entire city, with the reluctant help of Lucius Fox. Both the civilians and the prisoners refuse to kill each other, while Batman apprehends the Joker after a brief fight. Before the police arrive to take the Joker into custody, he gloats that Gotham's citizens will lose hope once Dent's rampage becomes public knowledge.|$|E

Douchebag visits Kupa Keep and learns that the Stick has again been stolen by the elves. Cartman and Kyle task Douchebag with {{recruiting}} the Goth kids for their respective sides, each claiming that the other has the Stick. Randy agrees to help Douchebag recruit the Goths after Douchebag infiltrates the crash site and discovers that government agents are plotting to <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> town in order to destroy an alien goo released from the ship. The goo turns living creatures into Adolf Hitler-esque Nazi Zombies; an infected person escapes government containment, unleashing the virus on South Park.|$|E
5|$|Croitoru had {{a history}} of run-ins with the police. Many of his legal {{problems}} came while he was president of the Hamilton, Ontario chapter of the Satan's Choice Outlaw motorcycle club. He was arrested for trafficking cocaine and served ten months in prison. Soon after, he was convicted of assault and was given a sentence of seven months. He encountered more problems on December 15, 1996 when he and several friends from Satan's Choice were kicked out of a strip club for wearing their gang's colors. To get revenge, Croitoru and his friends planned to <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> strip club. They changed their minds, however, and decided to bomb the local police station instead. The bomb caused $133,000 in damages to the Sudbury, Ontario police station and a nearby bank and injured a police officer. Croitoru and two friends were arrested and charged, but the trial did not begin until almost two years later.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, the British forces {{landed on}} the island and told the keeper's wife, Thankful Stone, that they had nothing to fear as long as they kept the light burning. Later, the keeper, Solomon Stone, had to put the light out per order of the New London customs inspector. The British {{threatened}} to <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> lighthouse, and Stone got an order to relight the lighthouse. In 1856, the light was upgraded from the twelve lamps to a fourth-order Fresnel lens. The light's new characteristic was a fixed light with a flash every two seconds. Around 1976, a GE 1000-watt bulb was used. When the lighthouse was repaired after the fire and automated in 1978, a modern optic replaced the Fresnel lens. The lighthouse currently uses a VRB-25 lens. The lighthouse switched to solar power in 1988. The light's characteristic is a flash of white light every ten seconds. It continues to operate as a navigational aid to the nearby Intracoastal Waterway.|$|E

Given her power levels this tends to cause explosions. Quite often, something will happen to louse up whatever scheme she's currently cooked up. Examples including: drinking one of her own love potions, trying to help Belldandy bake a cake and <b>blowing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> kitchen, trying to help Keiichi build a motorbike and <b>blowing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> garage, trying to dispel a number of computer [...] "bugs" [...] and <b>blowing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> house, and so on.|$|R
5|$|Frank and {{the group}} reach the sub, and they take control of it. After betraying the Man in Black, Widmore's men attack, but they manage to submerge. Jack then discovers the Man in Black planted the C4 in Jack's bag. Sayid sacrifices himself and runs off with the C4 {{as far away from}} the others as he could until it explodes. The {{explosion}} causes the submarine to sink, and Frank is knocked out after a door hits him. Frank revives and makes it {{to the surface of the}} water. He is found by Richard and Miles as they head for Hydra Island to <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Ajira plane. Frank convinces them to steal the plane and let him fly it. After much repair work and picking up Kate, Claire, and Sawyer, the plane takes off and heads for home.|$|E
5|$|Group Two, {{under the}} command of Captain Burn, would land at the old {{entrance}} to the St Nazaire basin. Their objectives were to destroy the anti-aircraft positions in the area and the German headquarters, to <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> locks and bridges at the old entrance into the basin and then to guard against a counter-attack from the submarine base. Group Three was {{under the command}} of Major William 'Bill' Copland, who was also the Commandos' second in command. They were to secure the immediate area around Campbeltown, destroy the dock's water-pumping and gate-opening machinery and the nearby underground fuel tanks. All three groups were subdivided into assault, demolition and protection teams. The assault teams would clear the way for the other two. The demolition teams carrying the explosive charges only had sidearms for self-defence; the protection teams, armed with Thompson submachine guns, were to defend them while they completed their tasks.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Ben Shoshan and Yehuda Etzion, both {{members of}} the Gush Emunim Underground, plotted to <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock. Etzion {{believed}} that blowing up the two mosques would cause a spiritual awakening in Israel, and would solve all {{the problems of the}} Jewish people. They also hoped the Third Temple of Jerusalem would be built on the location of the mosque. On 15 January1988, during the First Intifada, Israeli troops fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters outside the mosque, wounding 40 worshipers. On 8October1990, 22 Palestinians were killed and over 100 others injured by Israeli Border Police during protests that were triggered by the announcement of the Temple Mount Faithful, a group of religious Jews, {{that they were going to}} lay the cornerstone of the Third Temple.|$|E
