Based on studies of KIT mutations in mice, the severity of this mutation suggests that it may be nonviable in the homozygous state.

500|$|The white (W) locus {{was first}} {{recognized}} in mice in 1908. The mutation {{of the same}} name produces a belly spot and interspersed white hairs on the dorsal aspect of the coat in the heterozygote (W/+) and black-eyed white in the homozygote (W/W). While heterozygotes are healthy, homozygous W mice have severe macrocytic anemia and die within days. A mutation which affects multiple systems is [...] "pleiotropic." [...] Following the mapping of the KIT gene to the W locus in 1988, researchers began identifying other mutations as part of an allelic series of W. There are over 90 known W alleles, each representing a unique mutation on the KIT gene, which primarily produce white spotting from tiny head spots to fully white coats, macrocytic anemia from mild to lethal, and sterility. Some alleles, such as sash produce white spotting alone, while others affect the health of the animal even in the heterozygous state. Alleles encoding small amounts of white are no more likely to be linked with anemia and sterility than those encoding conspicuous white. Presently, no anecdotal or research evidence has suggested that equine KIT mutations affect health or fertility.

Nine goats were randomly and equally divided into three groups having almost same age and weight. Three groups were divided as zero hour (T 0), four hours (T 4) and eight hours (T 8) of heat exposure. The T 0 group were not exposed to heat stress, the T 4 and T 8 group were exposed to heat by keeping them at outside for 4 (four) hours and 8 (eight) hours from 9. 00 AM to 1. 00 PM and from 9. 00 AM to 5. 00 PM, respectively. Temperature– humidity index (THI) was calculated as 26. 88 indicating all the experimental animals were in extreme severe heat stress. The <b>blood</b> <b>parameter</b> such as RBC, PCV%, Hb%, WBC was significantly (p< 0. 01) higher in T 8 group than those of T 4 and T 0 groups. There was also significant (p< 0. 05) effect of heat stress on pH of the meat from different groups of the Black Bengal goats.

Material and methods: The study group consisted of  112 patients aged 11 – 17 years (42 girls and  70 boys) with diagnosed primary hypertension. Nutrition indicators were taken into account. The study group was divided into group I – persons with normal nutrition status (40 patients) and group II – persons with overweight/obesity (72 patients). The groups were compared using the t-test with a separate variance estimation or with the Mann–Whitney U test. The relationship between <b>blood</b> pressure <b>parameters</b> and nutrition status indicators was assessed based on Spearman’s rank correlation. Results: The study groups were significantly different in terms of the nutrition status indicators, but no significant differences were observed in the evaluated <b>blood</b> pressure <b>parameters.</b> The nutrition status indicators in group I were not significantly correlated with the <b>blood</b> pressure <b>parameters.</b> Significant correlations were found in group II.

The acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were an organophosphate, Malathion and a carbamate, Carbaryl. The respiratory irritants were Acrolein and Benzaldehyde. In part {{three of the}} experiment series, polar narcotics phenol, 2,4-dimethylphenol, aniline, 2-chloroaniline and 4-chloroaniline were evaluated.

These included an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, Chlorpyrifos; two pyrethroid insecticides, Fenvalerate and Cypermethrin; two cyclodiene insecticides, Endrin and Endosulfan; and a rodenticide, Strychnine. The duration of the exposure depended on the experiment, but the range was from 24 to 48 hours. Therefore, exposure resulted in acute toxicity. The Rainbow trout were exposed to a 24- to 48-hour lethal concentration of the toxicant. The respiratory and cardiovascular responses monitored throughout the exposure were cough rate, ventilation rate, ventilation volume, total oxygen consumption, oxygen utilization, heart rate, arterial blood pressure, arterial blood oxygen, arterial blood carbon dioxide, arterial blood pH, hematocrit, hemoglobin, electrocardiogram, plasma ions (calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and chloride), and osmolality.

40|$|Ascites, {{also called}} {{pulmonary}} hypertension syndrome, is a metabolic disorder in chickens {{that have an}} insufficient pulmonary vascular capacity. The tendency of broilers to develop ascites is heritable, and successful selection against this susceptibility would benefit from good and easy-to-measure indicator traits. <b>Blood</b> gas <b>parameters</b> have been suggested as indicator traits for ascites susceptibility. Therefore, {{the aim of the}} present study was to estimate the heritability of <b>blood</b> gas <b>parameters</b> and the genetic and phenotypic correlations between <b>blood</b> gas <b>parameters,</b> heart ratio (postmortem indicator for ascites), and BW at 2 different ages. For this purpose, <b>blood</b> gas <b>parameters,</b> including the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in venous blood (pvCO 2), the partial pressure of oxygen in venous blood (pvO 2), and blood oxygen saturation, were measured at an average age of 22 d in nearly 3, 000 broilers. To challenge the resistance of the birds to ascites, they were kept under cold conditions. Heritability for heart ratio was 0. 43, and the heritability estimates were low: 0. 02 for pvCO 2, 0. 03 for pvO 2, and 0. 07 for blood oxygen saturation. The estimated heritability for pH was 0. 15, for bicarbonate was 0. 19, and for total carbon dioxide content was 0. 19. The genetic correlations between heart ratio and total carbon dioxide content (0. 31 ± 0. 15) and between heart ratio and bicarbonate (0. 31 ± 0. 15) were moderate and positive. For pvO 2, the genetic correlation with heart ratio was stronger and negative (– 0. 62 ± 0. 21); however, this correlation could not be estimated accurately because of the low heritability of pvO 2. For pvCO 2, the genetic correlation with the heart ratio was close to zero (– 0. 04 ± 0. 45). Phenotypic correlations between traits were, in general, similar to the genetic correlations.
