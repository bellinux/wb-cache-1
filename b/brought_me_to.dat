5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E

I am at the ends of the earth, but the distance cannot tempt me to make my vows to another goddess. Love of the truth <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Tibur, but Onuava’s favorable powers came with me. Thus, divine mother, far from my home-land, exiled in Italy, I address my vows and prayers to you no less.|$|E
500|$|Beiderbecke {{died in his}} apartment, No.1G, 43-30 46th Street, in Sunnyside, Queens, on August 6, 1931. The {{week had}} been quite hot, making sleep difficult, and late into the evenings, Beiderbecke had played piano, both to the {{annoyance}} and {{to the delight of}} his neighbors. On the evening of August 6, at about 9.30 pm, his rental agent, George Kraslow, heard noises coming from across the hallway. [...] "His hysterical shouts <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> his apartment on the run," [...] Kraslow told Philip Evans in 1959.|$|E

500|$|Bridges {{opined that}} Tron: Legacy was evocative {{of a modern}} myth, adding that ideas {{alluding}} to technological advancement were prevalent throughout the film. To Cyriaque Lamar of io9, the film's approach to technology was reminiscent of a kōan. [...] "One {{of the things that}} <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> this film," [...] affirmed Bridges, [...] "was the idea of helping to create a modern-day myth to help us navigate through these technological waters [...] I dig immediate gratification as much as anybody, but it happens so fast that if you make a decision like that, you can go far down the wrong path. Think about those plastic single-use water bottles. Where did that come from? Who decided that? You can have a couple of swigs of water [...] and those bottles don't disintegrate entirely. Microscopic animals eat the plastic, and the fish eat those, and we're all connected. It's a finite situation here." ...|$|E

Moore urged Kidd to attack the Dutchman, an act not only piratical but also certain to anger Dutch-born King William. Kidd refused, calling Moore a lousy dog. Moore retorted, [...] "If I am a lousy dog, you have made me so; you have <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> ruin and many more." [...] Kidd snatched up and heaved an ironbound bucket at Moore. Moore fell to the deck with a fractured skull and died the following day.|$|E
2500|$|All the victims' {{personal}} possessions {{would be destroyed}} following the ritual of bathing their bodies {{in an effort to}} obliterate their identity prior to their murder and their now becoming what Nilsen described as a [...] "prop" [...] in his fantasies. In several instances, Nilsen would talk to the victim's body as it remained seated in a chair or prone on his bed and he harked to his being emotional as he marvelled at the beauty of his victims' bodies. With reference to one victim, Kenneth Ockenden, Nilsen harked that Ockenden's [...] "body and skin were very beautiful", adding the sight [...] "almost <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> tears". Another, unidentified victim had been so emaciated that he had simply been discarded under the floorboards.|$|E
2500|$|In 1921, he {{appeared}} again in opera as Don José in Carmen and as Lohengrin for Carl Rosa at Covent Garden, but thereafter devoted {{most of his}} efforts to concert performance. In 1921 he sang Gerontius at the memorial meeting for Gervase Elwes at the Royal Albert Hall with the Royal Choral Society. (He sang wonderfully, according to the Sunday Times, a courageous thing to do since {{in his own words}} he found the sudden death of Elwes in a train accident 'too shocking, too staggering to contemplate. It has affected me to the very depths of my nature ... it <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> my knees.') From 1920 he began to specialise in song-recitals, of which he gave several each year, favouring all-English performances and championing English composers, but drawing from the repertoire of German and French songs also. In 1922 Roger Quilter, who had written much for Elwes and worked closely with him, dedicated his 'Morning song' (Thomas Heywood) to Coates, one of his most vibrant and characteristic miniatures, though Coates did not give the first performance of it.|$|E

2500|$|That {{garden was}} the place where my {{appearance}} as a cyclist at the Vélodrome d’Hiver was thought up. Gleizes and Villon claimed that I wouldn’t be able to cycle 100 kilometres without putting a foot on the ground. I bet them that I could {{for the price of}} a lunch. It’s actually a pretty hard thing to do to keep going over 100 kilometres on country roads. Neither of my opponents had a car and they didn’t want to chase after me on one of those velocipedes. A journalist from our circle of friends suggested cycling in a velodrome which is actually just as tiring, especially for someone who is not used to it. But I agreed. A few days later, one morning at ten, I began my laps in the Vélodrome d’Hiver. An hour went by and then another. The spectators, Fernand Léger was among them, cheered me on with increasing enthusiasm until quite unexpectedly the sound of a gong <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> a halt. I had won my meal by my honourable average speed. (Metzinger) ...|$|E
2500|$|Rockenfield {{wrote the}} music for [...] "In This Light", [...] "A World Without", and [...] "Open Road". After {{finishing}} the framework, consisting of drums and guitars, he sent the demo to La Torre, who would write lyrics and melodies to the song. Rockenfield and La Torre {{turned out to have}} a great songwriting chemistry together, which became evident during their first collaboration on [...] "A World Without". When Rockenfield emailed the band the framework of [...] "A World Without" [...] he had just finished at home, it already had that name as a placeholder song title. La Torre was at his home in Florida and received the song around 2 or 3 a.m. La Torre said: [...] "I played it and started typing as I was feeling the melody", finishing the lyrics and melody to the song in less than an hour. He recorded the vocals, and within two hours sent it back to Rockenfield, telling him: [...] "It is done." [...] They called one another, with La Torre saying in happy tears: [...] "It was the most moving piece of music that <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> a place, and I'm just so touched by it." [...] Wilton subsequently started writing the guitar solo, and Rockenfield worked on orchestration for the song to be put on top of the heavy guitars, explaining: [...] "I was really in a zone when I wrote it. We wanted to make that as epic as possible. We got an orchestra, [...] we brought in Pamela Moore as the guest voice." [...] Wilton said it [...] "is certainly atmospheric and epic, and that Scott Rockenfield is doing all the orchestration and the implementation of the violins and cello certainly add to that." [...] Rockenfield and La Torre wrote [...] "Open Road" [...] a week after [...] "A World Without". According to La Torre, the process was similar: [...] "it just took me into a certain place". The lyrics and melody were finished in a few hours, after which Wilton wrote a solo for it.|$|E
