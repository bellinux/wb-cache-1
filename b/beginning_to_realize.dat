5|$|Archaea {{differ from}} {{bacteria}} in both their genetics and biochemistry. For example, while bacterial cell membranes {{are made from}} phosphoglycerides with ester bonds, archaean membranes are made of ether lipids. Archaea were originally described as extremophiles living in extreme environments, such as hot springs, but have since been found in all types of habitats. Only now are scientists <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> how common archaea are in the environment, with Crenarchaeota being {{the most common form}} of life in the ocean, dominating ecosystems below 150 m in depth. These organisms are also common in soil and play a vital role in ammonia oxidation.|$|E
500|$|... "Field Trip" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz, who described the writing process as [...] "an experience". The script went through several phases; originally, the script was supposed to feature Mulder trapped in a cave with a mysterious monster. Then, the script was changed so that both Mulder and Scully would be trapped in the cave. Finally, the story was altered so that both Mulder and Scully only believed that they two were trapped in a cave, with only Mulder <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> what was actually going on.|$|E
500|$|In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt {{created the}} first {{wildlife}} refuge in the United States, Pelican Island. [...] Its first warden, Paul Kroegel, joined forces with Bradley to enforce the illegality of bird-hunting in Florida. [...] By 1904, the various Audubon organizations had 34 wardens employed in ten states. [...] Conservationist publications were optimistic that Bradley and other wardens would be successful in their enforcement; in AOU's January 1904 issue of The Auk, an editor wrote: [...] "The natives are <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that the birds are to be protected and that the wardens are fearless men who {{are not to be}} trifled with. [...] The Bradleys have the reputation of being the best rifle shots in that vicinity and they would not hesitate to shoot when necessary." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{friendship}} that Lana shares with Chloe was deeply damaged {{at the start}} of season three, so much so that not even Kreuk realized how badly until the episode [...] "Truth". Lana is aware that Chloe still has romantic feelings for Clark, but their friendship suffered the most when Chloe revealed that she had known where Clark had been hiding for months. The feelings of distrust for Chloe remained hidden until [...] "Truth"—where Chloe gained the ability to have others speak the truth no matter what—when Lana finally revealed how much she cannot trust Chloe. This developing friendship between Lex and Lana puts a strain on Lana's relationship with Clark. Just as Clark is <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> the truth about Lex and his lies, Lana is starting to trust Lex more. Ultimately, it is Clark's own lack of honesty that forces Lana to leave Smallville and go to Paris at the end of season three. In the end, Kreuk believes that Clark is Lana's only true friend, as Lex is more focused on bringing his father to justice and she and Chloe have a tense relationship based on their mutual feelings for Clark.|$|E
500|$|The song {{has been}} {{described}} by several critics as a masterpiece. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine placed the song at No.404 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, commenting that Dylan [...] "never sounded lonelier than in this seven-minute ballad, cut in a single take on Valentine's Day 1966." [...] (When Rolling Stone updated their list in 2010, the song dropped to No.413.) In 1999, Britain's Poet Laureate, Andrew Motion, chose it as his candidate for the best song lyric ever written. Motion praised [...] "the concentration and surprise" [...] of Dylan's lyrics, and said that, although he distanced himself from some of the singer's views about women, the [...] "rasp of his anger" [...] was a part of his greatness. The International Observer named the song the second best ever recorded in 2017, stating, [...] "The 24 year old Dylan was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that no matter how many perfect songs he wrote he could not achieve immortality through his art as he perhaps once believed, because even if people were still listening to the music in 500 years, he would still be dead." [...] Commenting on the song in a 1985 interview, Dylan said, [...] "I still sing that song every once in a while. It still stands up now as it did then, maybe even more in some kind of weird way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Two of the theatre's stars {{provided}} {{inspiration for}} the young singer. [...] "Watching the art of Nezhdanova and Sobinov ... I was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> {{for the first time}} that even great masters, in order to elevate their character to peaks of expressiveness have to expose their inner exaltation in the most stark, transparent ways; that hidden riches of an artist's inner world should come hand in hand with economy in outward movement", she wrote in autobiography.|$|E
2500|$|The {{gentrification}} of once rundown inner-city areas, {{coupled with}} the staging of pride parades in these areas, {{has resulted in the}} increased visibility of gay communities. Parades such as Sydney's Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras and Manchester's Pride events attract significant investment and create tourist revenue, and cities are <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize,</b> firstly, that the acceptance of lesbian and gay culture is fast becoming a sign of urban [...] "sophistication", and secondly, that gay-oriented events, such as pride parades, the World Outgames and the Gay Games, are potentially lucrative events, attracting thousands of gay tourists and their dollars. The growing recognition of the economic value of the gay community is not only associated with their wealth but also with the role that lesbians and gay men have played (and continue to play) in urban revitalization.|$|E
2500|$|The words [...] "down" [...] and [...] "up", {{according}} to Fuller, are awkward {{in that they}} refer to a planar concept of direction inconsistent with human experience. The words [...] "in" [...] and [...] "out" [...] should be used instead, he argued, because they better describe an object's relation to a gravitational center, the Earth. [...] "I suggest to audiences that they say, 'I'm going [...] "outstairs" [...] and [...] "instairs."' At first that sounds strange to them; They all laugh about it. But if they try saying in and {{out for a few}} days in fun, they find themselves <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that they are indeed going inward and outward in respect to the center of Earth, which is our Spaceship Earth. And for the first time they begin to feel real 'reality.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Although DRM is {{prevalent}} for Internet music, some online music {{stores such as}} eMusic, Dogmazic, Amazon, and Beatport, do not use DRM despite encouraging {{users to}} avoid sharing music. Major labels have begun releasing more music without DRM. Eric Bangeman suggests in Ars Technica that {{this is because the}} record labels are [...] "slowly <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that they can't have DRMed music and complete control over the online music market at the same time... One way to break the cycle is to sell music that is playable on any digital audio player. eMusic does exactly that, and their surprisingly extensive catalog of non-DRMed music has vaulted it into the number two online music store position behind the iTunes Store." [...] Apple's Steve Jobs called on the music industry to eliminate DRM in an open letter titled Thoughts on Music. Apple's iTunes Store will start to sell DRM-free 256 kbit/s (up from 128 kbit/s) AAC encoded music from EMI for a premium price (this has since reverted to the standard price).|$|E
