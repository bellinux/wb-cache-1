25|$|The {{input to}} a belt press filter is {{generally}} measured as {{the rate of}} dry solids loading (mass of dry solids per time per <b>belt</b> <b>width).</b> Again, the input solids loading {{is dependent on the}} sludge type and filter media, thus there is great variation in the dry solids loading rates of operating belt press filters. Typically, lower range solids loading rates fall in the range of 40–230kg/h/m <b>belt</b> <b>width</b> and high range solids loading rates fall in the range of 300–910kg/h/m <b>belt</b> <b>width.</b> Whilst loading is important for measuring production rate, {{it is also important to}} consider the thickness of the cake that forms in the gravity drainage section. Cake thickness affects the permeability of the filtration media and the filtration rate. Testing for the particular sludge type must be conducted to determine the optimum cake thickness. In some cases where filtrate recovery is important, it may be necessary to introduce a cake washing step.|$|E

The belts were tested on a Caterpillar 55 tractor equipped with the Mobil-trac™ system and the tires on a John Deere 8400 mechanical front-wheel-drive (MFWD) tractor. The performance tests were completed on two surfaces, one being a non-tilled wheat stubble field and the second, the wheat stubble field tilled approximately 23 cm (9 in.) deep with a Noble blade sweep. Performance comparisons using tractive efficiency, dynamic traction ratio, and slip were made. Results of these performance comparisons between the belts and tires indicate that, in general, the belts performed better.

This project encompasses the usage of a combination of an overland conveyor system, modern barges and barging technologies as well as a transhipper. Located approximately 50 kilometres south-east of Rockhampton and approximately 40 kilometres north-west of Gladstone in Central Queensland my thesis project is set to deliver a low impact and inventive coal export solution(IAS, June 2011). The project is set to have an overall export of 18 million tonnes of coal per annum and will include construction of a rail unloading facility, stockyard, barge loading terminal and offshore marine transhipment operation. The project will incorporate barging technology rather than more traditional port facilities and transport coal along Raglan Creek near Port Alma and then transfer the coal into ships in the open waters.

50|$|The exposed drum shafts {{are used}} to install and fix the drum motor into the {{conveyor}} frame and do not rotate. The shaft can be a single “through” shaft where the motor and gearbox are assembled on, and fixed to, the shaft with keys or pins. However, this type of drum motor design has a limited maximum radial load due to the bending stresses caused by the normal belt tension of a conveyor and is therefore used mainly for small light duty conveyors and loads. For heavier loads the most common design is to use two separate shafts, one fixed to the motor housing and one fixed to the gearbox housing where the mass of metal from the motor and gearbox significantly increases {{the strength of the}} drum motor allowing much higher payloads and longer conveyor applications. Typically one shaft is short (stub shaft) with a consistent length and the other increases in length according to the drum shell or <b>belt</b> <b>width.</b> Over certain widths, the shaft can be further reinforced to prevent bending under high belt tension.|$|E
5000|$|The main use of {{the unit}} is to flatten out {{deformed}} press belts whilst simultaneously stress-relieving the belt material. The small size and low weight makes the unit flexible to use and easy to bring into and operate in field situations. All of the equipment needed (excluding the carriage frame and the air compressor) can be packed into a box with dimensions of about: 350mm L * 350mm W * 320mm. Total weight including blaster, valve, air hose and miscellaneous components is around 25kg and the blasting machine itself weights only 9kg. One pair of universal channel (38mm * 76mm [...] ) must be provided on site - the length usually being 500mm longer than the <b>belt</b> <b>width.</b> The channels are welded together so that the blaster can easily run through the frame {{across the face of}} the belt. The total installation time, including the manufacture of the carriage frame, is limited to just a few hours after which the peening process can begin. On the inlet air hose an electric shut-off valve is mounted to protect the belt from over-blasting should the belt suddenly stop during the blasting operation. To be effective the valve solenoid must be connected / interlocked to the press machine's power supply (240 V). For best blasting results an air supply of 4200 litre per min is required at a pressure of 6 bar. A flexible air hose is supplied with the unit which is to be connected between the blasting unit and the local air supply. All local supply pipes should have a minimum bore diameter of 1". The recommended shot blasting medium is tungsten shot (beads) with diameter ranging from 0.2-0.4 mm having a hardness exceeding 40 HRC. The machine operates by drawing a quantity of tungsten shot {{from the bottom of the}} scroll case into the high velocity nozzles. The shot is blasted onto the surface of the belt and most of the shot bounces back into the scroll case. The air is vented through the filter socks and any shot carried with the air is filtered out and drops back into the scroll case.|$|E

Current delineation procedures utilize site-specific historical migration assessments, or published empirical equations to predict meander <b>belt</b> <b>width.</b> In the case of altered, low order watercourses in southern Ontario, the meander <b>belt</b> <b>width</b> dimension is usually assessed by the application of empirical relations, as the available historic record often lacks the information necessary to conduct meander morphology and migration assessments.

50|$|A stable belt {{is a wide}} webbing belt, {{usually a}} single solid colour or {{horizontally}} striped in two or more different colours. It is worn around the waist and when worn with Combat Soldier 95 it is worn through the trouser belt loops.

A large number of units, however, continue to use the traditional method of securing the belt using two leather straps and metal buckles at the left-hand side.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Tire’s {{are made}} up of a typical fiber–rubber {{composite}} structure. A finite element model of a tire with foundation contact is developed in this study. In this model, the rubber compounds are simulated by incompressible elements, which are treated using the Lagrangian multipliers method. The nonlinear mechanical properties of the elastomers are modeled by the Mooney–Rivlin model. The belts, carcass, and bead are modeled by an equivalent orthotropic material model in which the effective moduli are determined from the individual material properties of the rubber compound and cord based on the Halpin–Tsai equations. For composite elements consisting of multi-ply cord–rubber composites, three-dimensional effective elastic constants can be determined using the material model presented by Sun and Li. The contact constraint of the tire with a flat foundation and rigid rim is treated using the variable constraint method. For the large deformation description of the tire, the Lagrangian method is used here. The strain tensor and the stress tensor are selected as, respectively, the Green–Lagrangian strain tensor and the second Piola– Kirchhoff stress tensor. In finite element code, two kinds of three-dimensional elements are used – an eight-node brick isoparametric element (hexahedral element) and a six-node isoparametric element (pentahedral element). The present numerical results show that the reliability and convergence of the model are fairly good. Moreover, three groups of radial tires with different <b>belt</b> <b>widths</b> under inflation and static footprint loading are analyzed using the finite element method. Based on the detailed analysis for stress analysis parameters in the critical regions in the tires, the relative belt edge endurance is predicted...|$|R

40|$|Although {{there are}} many works dealing with the {{economic}} analysis of a long conveyor, the information about a short conveyor is insufficient. This study, thus, deals with the short conveyor by studying the effect of <b>belt</b> <b>width,</b> belt length, convey capacity, and conveyor inclination angle on the cost characteristic of short conveyor. The study was done by calculating the conveyor belt widths and their supports that could service a given convey capacity, conveyor length, and inclination angle. The cost of conveyor corresponding to each <b>belt</b> <b>width</b> was, later, determined. After {{the total cost of}} each conveyor had been already calculated, the lowest total cost of conveyor for a given convey capacity, inclination angle, and conveyor length was found. The relationships between the belt widths, belt length, convey capacity, inclination angle and the lowest total cost was, finally, analyzed. In addition, the increase of the lowest total cost, when an overdesign of convey capacity was made, was also investigated. The study was done by case study of conveyor of convey capacity of 50 - 500 ton h - 1, the <b>belt</b> <b>width</b> of 400 - 1500 mm, the conveyor length of 10 - 100 m and conveyor inclination angle of 0 - 30 Â°.

The lowest total cost increased with the increase of the belt length. For normal convey capacity of 50 ton h - 1, an overdesigned value of 50 ton h - 1 caused the lowest total cost to increase more than 7 % compared with the lowest total cost in case of normal convey capacity. For normal convey capacity more than 100 ton h - 1, an overdesigned value of 50 ton h - 1 made the increase of the lowest total cost less than 2 %...|$|E

These environments have complex geometries and facies distribution is difficult to predict spatially. This study defined palaeogeographic reconstructions using log-signature responses from equivalent chronostratigraphic intervals, modern fluvial analogues and regional TWT isochrons. This resulted in the definition of spatial distribution of fluvio-lacustrine facies throughout the Tenappera region, Cooper Basin, South Australia. 379 wells were correlated into 21 chronostratigraphic intervals wireline log responses. 6 electrofacies were identified from the gamma ray and sonic velocity log motifs. These were combined with modern fluvial analogues to yield 4 facies assemblages. Multiple modern analogues were considered suitable for the Patchawarra Formation in the Tenappera Region. The Ob River, Siberia is considered more suitable for depositional facies whereas the McKenzie River, Northwest Territories demonstrated the influence of a compressional stress regime on fluvial avulsion patterns and styles. In order to map channel <b>belt</b> <b>width</b> within a chronostratigraphic interval empirical relationships from previous studies were applied. By measuring bankfull depth from well data an estimate of channel <b>belt</b> <b>width</b> is obtained. 532 bankfull measurements were taken giving a maximum bankfull depth of 8. 2 m, a minimum of 1. 4 m and a mean value of 5. 1 m. Channel <b>belt</b> <b>width</b> ranges were then estimated by applying bankfull population statistics to applicable linear regression curves. Channel <b>belt</b> <b>width</b> calculations gave a range of variability from 76 m to 3625 m, with an average channel <b>belt</b> <b>width</b> range from 1639 - 1908 m. For the interpreted Patchawarra Formation intervals there were eight populations with similar channel belt ranges. High resolution palaeogeographic reconstruction of the Patchawarra Formation within the Tenappera Region allows for better prediction of facies distribution. There are two distinguishable periods of fluvial deposition deposition in the upper and lower Patchawarra Formation. Ultimately, the paleogeographic maps aid assessment of field prospects by defining depositional channel fairways which control reservoir distribution. These techniques could be applied to other fluvial dominated petroleum systems. Thesis (B. Sc. (Hons.)) [...] University of Adelaide, Australian School of Petroleum, 2014...|$|E
40|$|Reforestation {{will have}} {{important}} {{consequences for the}} global challenges of mitigating climate change, arresting habitat decline and ensuring food security. We examined field-scale trade-offs between carbon sequestration of tree plantings and biodiversity potential and loss of agricultural land. Extensive surveys of reforestation across temperate and tropical Australia (N = 1491 plantings) {{were used to determine}} how planting width and species mix affect carbon sequestration during early development ( 40 m) with about 25 % of planted individuals being eucalypts. Carbon and biodiversity goals were balanced in mixed-species plantings by establishing narrow <b>belts</b> (<b>width</b> 75 %) of eucalypts, and in monocultures of mallee eucalypt plantings by using the widest belts (ca. 6 – 20 m). Impacts on agriculture were minimized by planting narrow belts (ca. 4 m) of mallee eucalypt monocultures, which had the highest carbon sequestering efficiency. A plausible scenario where only 5 % of highly-cleared areas (< 30 % native vegetation cover remaining) of temperate Australia are reforested showed substantial mitigation potential. Total carbon sequestration after 15 years was up to 25 Mt CO 2 -e year− 1 when carbon and biodiversity goals were balanced and 13 Mt CO 2 -e year− 1 if block plantings of highest biodiversity potential were established. Even when reforestation was restricted to marginal agricultural land (<$ 2000 ha− 1 land value, 28 % of the land under agriculture in Australia), total mitigation potential after 15 years was 17 – 26 Mt CO 2 -e year− 1 using narrow belts of mallee plantings. This work provides guidance on land use to governments and planners. We show that the multiple benefits of young tree plantings can be balanced by manipulating planting width and species choice at establishment. In highly-cleared areas, such plantings can sequester substantial biomass carbon while improving biodiversity and causing negligible loss of agricultural land...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that the tropics have {{expanded}} from ~ 2 - 5 ° {{over the past few decades}} and that this widening may continue into the future in association with global climate change. This expansion has potentially important implications for subtropical societies that include profound changes in the hydrological cycle and large-scale atmospheric circulation. Consistent with theory, models forced by greenhouse gases (GHG's) produce this expansion, however, some measurements have showed that observed tropical expansion is significantly larger than simulations of the 20 th and 21 st century from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 3 (CMIP 3). Recent climate simulations have shown that direct heating of the troposphere and surface, such as that caused by absorbing aerosols can drive expansion. In this study, we quantify future changes in the tropical <b>belt</b> <b>width</b> using CAM 3 and the 4 Representative Concentration Pathway's (RCP's) through the end of the 21 st century. The RCP scenarios all assume stringent emissions controls on aerosols and their precursors, and hence include progressive decreases through the 21 st century. Changes in tropical <b>belt</b> <b>width</b> are analyzed using 5 metrics. We find that the global, annual expansion rates vary from. 09 +/-. 05 º and. 14 +/-. 03 º decade - 1 for GHG and SO 2 forcings respectively under RCP 4. 5. Furthermore, Northern hemisphere (NH) expansion rates vary from. 05 +/-. 04 º and. 12 +/-. 02 º decade - 1 for GHG and SO 2 forcings respectively under RCP 4. 5. As widening increases with RCP, SO 2 still accounts for as much widening as GHG's.

Her hull, strengthened by a cast iron stem {{and a large number}} of longitudinal and transverse bulkheads, is surrounded by an ice <b>belt</b> with a <b>width</b> of [...] and thickness of one inch (...) [...] To assist icebreaking in difficult conditions she is also equipped with heeling tanks and pumps capable of transferring 570 tons of water from one side to another in ten minutes, listing the ship by 10 degrees. Furthermore, her trim could be adjusted by a forepeak tank with a capacity of 600 tons of water. All tanks were connected to an electrical control and indication system.|$|R
40|$|Most {{small scale}} {{industries}} rely on human effort for transporting raw materials from one {{stage of processing}} to another thereby reducing the overall system performance. The work discusses {{the development of a}} belt conveyor system for small scale industry. The conveyor is of height 0. 75 m at 0 o angle of inclination, 35 o troughing angle and a surcharge angle of 25 o. It also consists of a <b>belt</b> whose <b>width</b> is 410 mm, length 2. 4 m and a basic length 4. 54 m. The conveyor has an average capacity of 43. 75 tonnes/hr. The evaluation of the conveyor was carried out by conveying 12 packs of bottled water of different weights across a distance of 2 m at a different speeds ranging from of 200 - 400 rpm. Results obtained indicated that the time of conveying the materials increases with increase in weight of the bottled water. The successful completion of this work provides a conveyor system which will aid the movement of material {{from one place to another}} with little or no human intervention. This will help the industry in reducing cost in acquiring labour that will be used in material movement thereby reducing cost of production...|$|R
50|$|Goodenough Island in the Solomon Sea (identified as Morata on the {{earliest}} maps) is the westernmost {{of the three}} large islands of the D'Entrecasteaux Islands in Milne Bay Province of Papua New Guinea. It lies {{to the east of}} mainland New Guinea and southwest of the Trobriand Islands. It is roughly circular in shape, measuring 39 by 26 km with an area of 687 km2 and a shoreline of 116 km. From a coastal <b>belt</b> varying in <b>width</b> from 2 to 10 km in width, the island rises sharply to the summit of Mount Vineuo, 2536 m above sea level, {{making it one of the}} most precipitous islands in the world. The small island of Wagifa Island lies to the south-east of the island and is included within Goodenough's administration.|$|R
