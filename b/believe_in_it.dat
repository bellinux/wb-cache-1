[...] One exception was physicist Gladys Anslow, Wrinch's colleague at Smith College, who studied the ultraviolet absorption spectra of proteins and peptides in the 1940s and allowed for the possibility of cyclols in interpreting her results.

Immediately after [...] "The Fight" [...] first aired, a [...] "Producer's Cut" [...] version was made available on the official NBC.com website. It included an additional four minutes of material, that include a previously-unaired cold open in which Ron sternly demands to know which employee has broken the parks department's coffee machine; this prompts a fight as the staff make accusations against each other. Ron secretly reveals to the camera that he broke the machine himself, but questioned the other employees anyway to deliberately start the arguments.|$|E
500|$|On 2 August, Hitler sent a {{directive}} to Kluge ordering [...] "an immediate counter-attack between Mortain and Avranches". General Walter Warlimont—the Deputy Chief of Staff at OKW, the German armed forces headquarters—was also sent to Kluge's headquarters to ensure these orders were complied with. Kluge {{suggested that there}} was no chance of success, and the German forces in Normandy should retire to the Seine River, pivoting on the intact defences south of Caen, but on 4 August, Hitler categorically ordered the attack to be launched. He demanded that eight of the nine Panzer Divisions in Normandy be used in the attack, and that the Luftwaffe commit its entire reserve, including 1,000 fighters. According to Hitler, three qualifications had to be met for the attack to proceed. [...] "Von Kluge must <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> He must be able to detach enough armour from the main front in Normandy to create an effective striking force, and he must achieve surprise".|$|E

He explained that this and other designed monsters are [...] "really super fantastical, they’re really out there, the anatomy and the biology of them is so wild and crazy, that it really takes a lot to make it look real in the scene and make it a part of the actors are reacting to these things – to get the audience to <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> is kind of the biggest challenge we’ve faced on the show so far." [...] During filming, the cast and crew referred to the monster as a [...] "were-upine" [...] or [...] "porcuman". Lance Reddick commented on set, [...] "When I first got here tonight, I was expecting zombies to come up out of the ground. And the actual creature looks so bizarre, I mean it really looks like something I wouldn't want to be caught in the woods with." [...] The crew spent over a week collecting and placing the plane wreckage together. According to Set Dresser Russ Griffin, the set included approximately 15,000 pounds worth of plane parts.|$|E

Writing for Rolling Stone, Jon Dolan was skeptical of Cyrus' increasingly provocative image, stating that the lyrics in the chorus would be [...] "an odd fit for any singer" [...] and opining that [...] "there's still a bit too much Disney in her voice to fill the track." [...] Naomi Zeichner of The Fader praised the song, writing, [...] "Cyrus said in her recent MTV doc (...) , that she chose it to be her album's first single: 'Not everyone {{came to me and said}} okay, you've got the first single.

She was right about this one. The song's straightforward party is now tied to a sordid universe of visuals- the official video and the VMA performance."

5000|$|Many {{philosophers}} {{have tried}} {{to solve the problem}} of demarcation in the following terms: a statement constitutes knowledge if sufficiently many people believe it sufficiently strongly. But the history of thought shows us that many people were totally committed to absurd beliefs. If the strengths of beliefs were a hallmark of knowledge, we should have to rank some tales about demons, angels, devils, and of heaven and hell as knowledge. Scientists, on the other hand, are very sceptical even of their best theories. Newton's is the most powerful theory science has yet produced, but Newton himself never believed that bodies attract each other at a distance. So no degree of commitment to beliefs makes them knowledge. Indeed, the hallmark of scientific behaviour is a certain scepticism even towards one's most cherished theories. Blind commitment to a theory is not an intellectual virtue: it is an intellectual crime.Thus a statement may be pseudoscientific even if it is eminently 'plausible' and everybody <b>believes</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> and it may be scientifically valuable even if it is unbelievable and nobody <b>believes</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> A theory may even be of supreme scientific value even if no one understands <b>it,</b> let alone <b>believes</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> Imre Lakatos ...|$|R
