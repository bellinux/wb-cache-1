5|$|Ottman {{said the}} {{challenge}} on Valkyrie {{was to create}} tension from dialogue scenes, and he often reshaped scenes to do this: moments rather than whole scenes were cut from the film. Being historically accurate meant Ottman was more restricted in reorganizing scenes, but {{he was able to}} choose what lines and close-ups he could focus on. Ottman said the scene he was most saddened to delete was a scene where von Stauffenberg dances with his wife because he had <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> to scoring it.|$|E
5|$|Surprisingly, Schneider {{was traded}} to the New Jersey Devils on June 30, 2013, {{reinstating}} Luongo in the starting position for the 2013–14 NHL season. John Tortorella, who had replaced Alain Vigneault as Canucks head coach after the conclusion of the 2012–13 season, chose rookie Eddie Läck to start in goal instead of Luongo in the Heritage Classic against the Ottawa Senators at BC Place. Tortorella's decision was unpopular with the crowd as they booed Läck, while Luongo was also unhappy as he had <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> to that game all season.|$|E

25|$|Before the U-2 {{incident}} Khrushchev and Eisenhower {{had been}} getting along {{well and the}} summit {{was going to be}} an opportunity for the two sides to come together. Also, Eisenhower had <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> to a visit to the Soviet Union and was very upset when his invitation was retracted. The two sides were going to discuss topics such as nuclear arms reduction and also how to deal with increasing tensions surrounding Berlin. According to Eisenhower, had it not been for the U-2 incident the summit and his visit to the Soviet Union could have greatly helped Soviet and American relations.|$|E
500|$|Changeling premiered in {{competition}} at the 61st Cannes Film Festival on May 20, 2008. The film was Eastwood's fifth to enter {{competition at the}} festival. Its appearance {{was not part of}} the original release plan. Universal executives had <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> to the festival without the worry associated with screening a film, until Eastwood made arrangements for Changelings appearance. He was pleased with the critical and commercial success that followed Mystic Rivers appearance at the festival in 2003 and wanted to generate the same [...] "positive buzz" [...] for Changeling. The film was still in post-production one week before the start of the festival. It appeared at the 34th Deauville American Film Festival, held September 514, 2008, and had its North American premiere on October 4, 2008 as the centerpiece of the 46th New York Film Festival, screening at the Ziegfeld Theatre.|$|E
500|$|The Church of Scientology {{and related}} {{entities}} sought injunctions against the book's publication, claiming copyright infringement of Hubbard's private documents. They {{threatened to sue}} {{in as many as}} fifty countries, adopting a strategy that the University of Pennsylvania's Professor Paul K. Saint-Amour has described as [...] "an international parade of litigation" [...] and [...] "whack-a-mole legal proceedings". Much of the dispute centred on the plaintiffs' argument that the actions of former Scientology archivist Gerry Armstrong in providing Miller with unpublished materials (whether directly or indirectly) were a breach of his duty of confidence to the Church, and that the use of excerpts from this material violated copyrights owned by Hubbard's estate. Miller later noted that the plaintiffs did not attempt to dispute the facts of the book in court which, he said, was a pity as he had <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> to defending his meticulous research.|$|E

500|$|Da Matta {{appeared}} in victory lane {{and later on}} the podium to celebrate his third win of the season; the victory earned him $1 million. He was happy with the result: [...] "I was pretty confident {{in the car and}} could go flat down to the end. You need to be a little lucky, being {{in the right place at}} the right time. For everybody, it's a very exciting race. We were racing all together all the time." [...] Da Matta stated he did not want to lead the race with two laps remaining because of the draft and believed there would be a larger battle for the victory. Second-place finisher Papis said his team were planning a new strategy after the race's distance was reduced and had <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> to further racing and congratulated Da Matta on winning the race. Tagliani, who finished in third, revealed that he lifted from his accelerator pedal and ran in fifth gear on the backstraight and stated it was about conserving fuel and avoiding being caught in any incidents. He said the final ten laps felt like qualifying lap times and felt the race before then was [...] "kind of boring, just driving around and around." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball {{formally}} {{announced an}} expansion {{team for the}} city of Lancaster. In November 2004, the Barnstormers announced the locally anticipated signing of Tom Herr, a Major League Baseball veteran and Lancaster native, as the team's first manager. At the press conference, Herr responded, [...] "I have <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> to the return of baseball to Lancaster for quite some time. This is almost too good to be true, being able to manage in my hometown." [...] His oldest son, Aaron, signed with the Barnstormers for the 2009 season, after a severe groin injury compromised his promising career at the Class-AAA level. Jordan Herr, the younger of Tom's two sons, joined the team {{in the first half of}} the 2008 season in lieu of completing his senior year at the University of Pittsburgh. Following his first season of professional baseball that included a [...]202 batting average with four home runs and 16 runs batted in, Jordan committed to the Great Falls Voyagers, a Rookie-level team in the Chicago White Sox system.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 April, a full {{month after}} Johnston was last seen, the BBC held an [...] "Alan Johnston Day of Action" [...] with events in London, Scotland and the Palestinian Territories {{to mark the}} day. Director-General of the BBC Mark Thompson gave {{a news conference in}} Ramallah, and made another appeal for Johnston's release. He said that Johnston [...] "had formed many strong friendships", and was [...] "held in great affection and regard by those who know him." [...] He {{repeated}} Fran Unsworth's comments made days earlier, saying that the BBC was [...] "increasingly concerned about the physical and mental toll" [...] of Johnston's [...] "incarceration". Thompson also said that [...] "Alan had <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> to returning to his staff post in London in the BBC World Service newsroom" [...] because [...] "Gaza [...] become an increasingly difficult and chaotic place for journalists to operate in safely", seemingly dispelling rumours that he had staged his own kidnapping because {{he did not want to}} be transferred. He also thanked the Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate for [...] "highlighting Alan's suffering", and the people of Gaza.|$|E
2500|$|Installed in Jamaica after a {{good deal}} of secrecy and close liaison between Downing Street and Ian Fleming's secretary, Una Trueblood, the Edens were {{temporary}} neighbours of Noël Coward who thought Goldeneye [...] "perfectly ghastly" [...] and presented them – [...] "poor dears" [...] – with a basket of caviare, pâté de foie gras and champagne. Coward also sent Frank Cooper's marmalade and Huntley and Palmer's biscuits, which, according to Lady Avon, [...] "was not what we had <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> to". As was sometimes the case when Fleming let Goldeneye, he asked his neighbour (and lover) Blanche Blackwell, a member of the influential Lindo family, to ensure that the Edens were properly looked after. Indeed, it seems that Lady Avon's mentioning that Blackwell had been helpful at Goldeneye led Ann Fleming to suspect that her husband and Blackwell were having an affair. The publicity that the Edens' sojourn attracted is credited by some with boosting Fleming's literary career, including sales of his early novels about James Bond, the first of which, Casino Royale, he had written at Goldeneye in 1952. Lady Avon later recalled her [...] "astonishment" [...] (and Ann Fleming's [...] "rueful embarrassment") at the success of the Bond books, which continued after From Russia with Love entered the best-seller lists in 1957.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the next}} match {{was made at}} the request of Kane, and had its roots in both a shift in {{character}} for Kane and a match at the previous year's Survivor Series. Kane's storyline brother, The Undertaker, challenged Vince McMahon to a Buried Alive match. Kane, who had adopted a much more sadistic persona since being forced to unmask back in June 2003, interfered in the match and buried his brother under several tons of dirt, apparently killing him. On the November 20 episode of SmackDown, Kane appeared to give the eulogy for his brother, claiming that The Undertaker was no longer his brother and had died a long time before that as he no longer embraced his dark side. This rewarded him a title match for the World Heavyweight Championship at Armageddon (2003) which it was won by Triple H in a triple threat match also involving Goldberg. Two months later, Kane participated in the Royal Rumble and was eliminated by Booker T after the bell from The Undertaker's old theme music began playing just to upset and distracted him. Over the following weeks, Kane repeatedly insisted that The Undertaker was [...] "dead", only to be met with various paranormal incidents such as a rainstorm localized over the ramp on which he stood. On the last episode of Raw, Kane appeared to the ring and saw an empty Casket standing in the ring but as he opened it, he saw an urn inside of it. He then grabbed the microphone and asked if that's what he's <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> to. He also stated it's going to take more than an empty casket and an urn to intimidate and beat him. He then stated that the Undertaker's legacy, his 11–0 WrestleMania streak and his life {{is coming to an end}} as he said [...] "it's back to the grave for you for good". As he claimed that It's over and that he's not afraid of the Undertaker. The lights turned out but this time, the 10,000 pound wrestling ring lifted off the ground with Kane standing in it and tilted side ways, which would be the final message sent from the Undertaker before their match at WrestleMania XX.|$|E
