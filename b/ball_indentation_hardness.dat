The {{friction}} and wear behavior of nylon 1010 composites filled with different proportions of ZnOw in reciprocating sliding against GCr 15 steel ball under dry friction condition were studied. The worn surface and wear particles were then examined with SEM. The elastic modulus, nano-hardness and <b>ball</b> <b>indentation</b> <b>hardness</b> of composites increased with {{the content of}} ZnOw. The coefficients of friction of composites decreased lightly, which changed from 0. 36 and 0. 26 of nylon matrix to 0. 30 and 0. 22 of composites at 0. 04 m/s and 0. 08 m/s sliding velocity, respectively. The anti-wear property of composites was improved with large extent. The typical wear mechanism of nylon matrix is adhesion and micro-melting. However, peeling of surface layer appears owing to fatigue for composites. Roll-shaped wear debris were produced for pure nylon, while flake-like debris for nylon composites...|$|E
40|$|The {{definitions}} {{and types of}} measurement of hardness are reviewed with special reference to the static indentation test. The present state {{of the theory of}} static <b>indentation</b> <b>hardness</b> testing of metals is described, together with previous measurements of the distortions of metal surfaces caused by indenting. Multiple beam interferometry is employed to measure the surface distortions. The apparatus and techniques employed, which include the application of multilayer dielectric films to the interferometrie study of metal surfaces, are described. The specific aspects of the surface distortions studied are: (1) Flow pattern shape, with special reference to the transition from ridging to sinking impressions, and variations due to the geometric shape of the indentation. (2) Volume of the flow pattern. This is found to be smaller than the volume of the indentation for all the indentations studied. Possible explanations of this discrepancy are discussed. (3) Shallowing or elastic recovery of <b>ball</b> <b>indentations.</b> The shallowing of <b>ball</b> <b>indentations</b> {{in a wide range of}} metals is studied, and its variation with load, hardness, and indenter is analysed. (4) The shape of recovered <b>ball</b> <b>indentations.</b> Shallow <b>ball</b> <b>indentations</b> are found to be not strictly spherical, in contrast to deeper <b>ball</b> <b>indentations.</b> Measures of their deviation from sphericity are proposed and an explanation of these deviations is discussed. (5) Critical specimen size. The mode of deformation occurring when a <b>hardness</b> test <b>indentation</b> is made near to the edge of the specimen is studied. The results are compared with the mode of deformation for wedge indentations in ideal and real metals. On the basis of the results a fuller description of the processes involved in ball hardness tests is possible. The surface distortions from the onset of plasticity to the fully plastic stage are described in detail, and support Tabor's theory of <b>ball</b> <b>indentation.</b> The treatment of the hardness test as predominantly a problem in plasticity is justified. <p...|$|R
40|$|The {{inability}} of cohesive powders to flow consistently and reliably {{is a major}} cause of process downtime and reduced efficiency across a wide range of powder processing industries. Most methods to assess powder flowability fail at low consolidation pressures (< 1 kPa). In this paper, the <b>ball</b> <b>indentation</b> technique is used to assess the flow behaviour of two powders at low stresses by determining the bed hardness. In parallel, the powders are subjected to shear testing in a range of high stresses, with the derived unconfined yield strength used, along with the <b>indentation</b> <b>hardness</b> to define the constraint factor (C). By using the latter, which is considered independent of the preconsolidation stress applied, the unconfined yield strength of the powders at low stresses are inferred from the penetration hardness measurements...|$|R

Calculations are carried out for indentation of a perfectly sticking rigid sharp indenter into a cylinder modeling indentation of a half space.

The indentation tests were performed with peak loads ranging from 5 to 400 mN in order to investigate the property variation with the variation of the peak load and material microstructure. The values of <b>indentation</b> <b>hardness</b> and Young’s modulus were calculated according to the models developed by Oliver and Pharr (O&P) and by Cheng and Cheng (C&C). According to the O&P model, the finest grained SiC ceramics did not show the indentation size effect (ISE) which was observed in the largest grained SiC ceramics. The grain-size dependence of the <b>indentation</b> <b>hardness</b> can be described by an inverse Hall–Petch relation.

Design/methodology/approach: Investigation using DMTA method was carried out for samples subjected to one-axial bending. The change {{in the value of the}} storage modulus E’ and the mechanical loss factor (tangent δ) in function of the temperature and oscillation frequency in DMTA tests were determined. In order to verify the change of thermal properties of PP with 2 % of dye addition, before and after electrochemical ageing, the investigation using DSC method was made. Findings: Higher values of the storage modulus occurred for the samples with dye addition. The crystallinity degree values were lower for the samples after electrochemical ageing. It was found that electrochemical ageing results in decrease in hardness values and Vicat softening temperature while increase in water absorptivity was noticed. Research limitations/implications: Dynamic properties of polypropylene with the dye addition were determined in one-axial bending test.

40|$|AbstractAn {{expanding}} cavity model (ECM) {{for determining}} <b>indentation</b> <b>hardness</b> of elastic strain-hardening plastic materials is developed. The derivation {{is based on}} a strain gradient plasticity solution for an internally pressurized thick-walled spherical shell of an elastic power-law hardening material. Closed-form formulas are provided for both conical and spherical indentations. The indentation radius enters these formulas with its own dimensional identity, unlike that in classical plasticity based ECMs where indentation geometrical parameters appear only in non-dimensional forms. As a result, the newly developed ECM can capture the indentation size effect. The formulas explicitly show that <b>indentation</b> <b>hardness</b> depends on Young’s modulus, yield stress, strain-hardening exponent and strain gradient coefficient of the indented material {{as well as on the}} geometry of the indenter. The new model reduces to existing classical plasticity based ECMs (including Johnson’s ECM for elastic–perfectly plastic materials) when the strain gradient effect is not considered. The numerical results obtained using the newly developed model reveal that the <b>hardness</b> is indeed <b>indentation</b> size dependent when the indentation radius is very small: the smaller the indentation, the larger the <b>hardness.</b> Also, the <b>indentation</b> <b>hardness</b> is seen to increase with the Young’s modulus and strain-hardening level of the indented material for both conical and spherical indentations. The strain-hardening effect on the hardness is observed to be significant for materials having strong strain-hardening characteristics. In addition, it is found that the <b>indentation</b> <b>hardness</b> increases with decreasing cone angle of the conical indenter or decreasing radius of the spherical indenter. These trends agree with existing experimental observations and model predictions...|$|R

The finding {{is contrary to the}} recent study on the hardness of NiTi SMAs using a sharp Berkovich indenter tip, where the interfacial energy plays a dominant role at small indentation depths. Our numerical investigation indicates that the influence of the interfacial energy is not significant on the spherical <b>indentation</b> <b>hardness</b> of SMAs. Furthermore, the depth dependency of SMA hardness under a spherical indenter is explained by the elastic spherical contact theory incorporating the deformation effect of phase transformation of SMAs. Hertz theory for purely elastic contact shows that the spherical hardness increases with the square root of the indentation depth. The phase transformation beneath the spherical tip weakens the depth effect of a purely elastic spherical hardness. This study enriches our knowledge on the basic concept of hardness for SMAs under spherical indentation at micro- and nanoscales. <br /...|$|R
