40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results on nine {{of the most important}} elasmobranch fish species of the nine years (2001 - 2009) of the Porcupine bank Spanish surveys. The main species in biomass terms in Porcupine bank bottom trawl survey, in decreasing biomass abundance order, are: blackmouth catshark, <b>birdbeak</b> <b>dogfish,</b> velvet belly, Knifetooth dogfish, lesser spotted dogfish, bluntnose sixgill shark, sandy ray, cuckoo ray and common skate. Many of these species occupy mainly the deep areas covered in the survey, especially <b>birdbeak</b> <b>dogfish,</b> knifetooth dogfish and velvet belly. Less confined to deeper grounds are blackmouth catshark and sandy ray, while lesser spotted dogfish and cuckoo ray inhabit mainly the shallower grounds close to the Irish shelf or the central mound in the bank. Length distributions of these species along the survey series are also presented and discussed. The few available data on siki sharks from the Porcupine bank survey are also summarized.

40|$|Deep-water sharks exhibit species-specific {{reproductive}} strategies, {{which include}} segregation by sex, size and reproductive stage. However, {{due to the}} wide spatial distribution of most species, available information, usually collected at a regional scale, is usually not adequate to infer species reproductive spatial dynamics. This study draws together information {{on the distribution of}} reproductive stages of three species of squaliform sharks: Portuguese dogfish Centroscymnus coelolepis (Somniosidae), leafscale gulper shark Centrophorus squamosus (Centrophoridae) and <b>birdbeak</b> <b>dogfish</b> Deania calcea (Centrophoridae), gathering data from several geographical areas from the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. For each species we analysed the sex ratio and the spatial patterns of reproductive stages within regions, considering the influence of geographical area, depth, season, temperature and salinity. The combination of statistical methods used in this study successfully identified a number of life history patterns which reflect different use of habitats by sex and life cycle stage. Pregnant females of the three species are spatially segregated, inhabiting shallower and/or warmer waters. In the case of the leafscale gulper shark this segregation might be associated with large scale migrations. In contrast, in Portuguese dogfish all adult maturity stages occur in the same geographical area. Pregnant female <b>birdbeak</b> <b>dogfish</b> were rare in all samples. Larger immature specimens of all the three species distribute deeper than the remaining maturity stages in most of the regions analysed. Mature males of leafscale gulper shark and <b>birdbeak</b> <b>dogfish</b> were more broadly distributed than mature females, supporting the possibility of sex-biased dispersal. Neonates and small sized specimens were scarce in the Northeast Atlantic potentially explained by their concentration in nurseries, and/or by gear selectivity. Management measures will benefit from considering the geographic scale of demographic variation between species. However, standardized collaborative approaches will be needed for comprehensive assessment. Publicado...|$|E

40|$|The {{by-catch}} {{of sharks}} in artisanal demersal pink cusk-eel (Genypterus blacodes) and yellownose skate (Dipturus chilensis) fisheries is frequent within their fishing effort. Nevertheless, {{there is no}} registry of landings, which could help to control this problem. This is particularly evident for endemic species, which includes most coastal and deep water Chilean sharks. The main systematic characteristic of these Chondrichthyan species is the external morphology of the neurocraneum. The form and arrangement of the teeth and dermal denticles allow specific differences to be identified. The objective {{of this paper is}} to contribute to the biology and systematic knowledge of demersal shark species, teeth and dermal denticle morphology and neurocraneum morphometrics of two species of Scyliorhinids, the redspotted catshark (Schroederichthys chilensis) and the dusky catshark (Halaelurus canescens), as well as three Squaliforms, the granular dogfish (Centroscyllium granulatum), the <b>birdbeak</b> <b>dogfish</b> (Deania calcea) and the spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) ...|$|E
40|$|This working {{document}} {{presents the results}} on the most significant elasmobranch species of the Porcupine Bank Spanish surveys in 2014 and updates the documents presented in previous years with {{the information in the}} whole historical series from 2001. The main species in biomass terms in this survey were Galeus melastomus (blackmouth catshark), Deania calcea (<b>birdbeak</b> <b>dogfish),</b> Scymnodon ringens (Knifetooth dogfish), Dipturus nidarosiensis (Norwegian skate), Scyliorhinus canicula (lesser spotted dogfish), Etmopterus spinax (velvet belly lantern shark), Hexanchus griseus (bluntnose sixgill shark), Dalatias licha (Kitefin shark), Leucoraja circularis (sandy ray), Dipturus cf. flossada, Leucoraja naevus (cuckoo ray) and Dipturus cf. intermedia (common skate). Biomass, distribution and length ranges were analysed for these species. All the species analysed increased its biomass in 2014, except S. canicula and D. cf. flossada that decreased. D. calcea individuals smaller than 65 cm were captured again in 2014 after not having been captured the previous year, although catches were very low.

40|$|Many {{species of}} deep-water shark {{are present in}} the Rockall Trough and are {{vulnerable}} to the impacts of deep-sea fisheries. Shark numbers are declining and commercially important prey items are being fished out of the ecosystem, affecting a number of aquatic food-webs. This paper describes the dietary composition of the <b>birdbeak</b> <b>dogfish</b> (Deania calceus) and the greater lantern shark (Etmopterus princeps) collected from the Rockall Trough between 55 - 57. 6 °N and 9 - 14 °W. D. calceus was collected from 650 - 1050 m at different locations and fed mainly on teleosts and cephalopods. Diet composition varied with depth but was not influenced by site, gender or maturity as immature specimens were largely absent from the sample. Comparisons of diet composition with previous fmdings demonstrate a shift in prey assemblage which may be as a result of fishing. E. princeps was sampled at 1500 m along the continental slope and diet composition was dominated by crustaceans, cephalopods and some fish. Diet composition was very different to that of D. calceus and did not vary between genders or maturity level. Both species exhibit generalist diets which counteract the effects of competition with other deep-water sharks and also the impacts of fisheries.

40|$|This survey {{took place}} {{over a period of}} 12 days in November and December 1999 on the western slope of the Porcupine Bank and the western and eastern slopes of the Porcupine Seabight. Fishing was carried out in five {{separate}} areas, in depths between 400 and 2, 000 meters. The primary objective of the survey was to obtain samples of chondricthyan and teleost fish for the Marine Institute (MI) deepwater research programme, for contaminant analysis of fish by the MI chemistry section and for food technology analysis at the Teagase National Food Centre. The survey was carried out on a commercial long-liner, using commercial deep-water autoline gear. In total 18 species of chondricthyan, 24 species of teleost fish and 1 species of cephalopod were taken. Among the most abundant species in the catch were bird beak dogfish, leafscale gulper shark, Portuguese dogfish and mora. Over the entire survey, discarding was estimated as 42 % of the total catch. The main species discarded were <b>birdbeak</b> <b>dogfish,</b> black mouth dogfish and greater lantern shark. Catch per 1, 000 hooks (CPU E) was highest abundances were found in the western and northwestern slope of the Porcupine Bank.

40|$|A {{deepwater}} survey programme {{has been}} operated since 1993 by the Marine Institute (MI), {{in the deep}} waters of the Rockall Trough and Porcupine Bank. The first leg of the present survey took place {{over a period of}} 12 days in August 2000 on the Western slope of the Porcupine Bank and the western slopes of Rockall Bank and Hatton Bank. The second leg took place on the slopes and shelves of the Porcupine Bank. Fishing was carried out in depths between 150 and 1, 800 meters. The primary objective of the survey was to obtain biological samples of chondricthyan and teleost fish, for contaminant analysis of fish by the MI chemistry section and for food technology analysis at the Teagase National Food Centre. The survey was carried out on the commercial long-liner "An Capall Bán," using commercial deepwater autoline gear. In total 26 species of chondricthyan and 24 species of teleost fish were taken. Among the most abundant species in the catch were <b>birdbeak</b> <b>dogfish</b> (22 %), leafscale gulpershark (14 %), Portuguese dogfish (8 %), tusk (17 %) and mora (8 %). Over the entire survey, discarding was estimated at 43 % of the total catch. The main species discarded were bird beak dogfish and greater lantern shark.

40|$|A {{deepwater}} trawl survey programme {{has been}} operated since 1993 by the Fisheries Research Centre (FRC) {{in the deep}} waters of the Rockall Trough and Porcupine Bank. The present survey took place {{over a period of}} 10 days in October and November 1997 on the eastern and southern slopes of the Rockall Trough from 54 °N to 59 °N. Fishing was carried out in five separate areas, in four depth strata: 500 - 700 m, 700 - 900 m, 900 - 1100 m and 1100 - 1300 m. The primary objective of the survey was to obtain samples of chondrichthyan and teleost fish for the FRC deepwater research programme, for contaminant analysis offish by the FRC chemistry section and for food technology analysis at the Teagasc National Food Centre. The survey was carried out on a commercial trawler using commercial deepwater demersal otter trawl gear. In total 15 species of chondrichthyan, 41 species of teleost fish and 5 species of cephalopods were taken. Among the most abundant species in the catch were roundnose grenadier, Portuguese dogfish, leafscale gulper shark, and Baird's smoothhead. Over the entire survey discarding was estimated as 50. 5 % of the total catch. Discard rates expressed as kg discarded per tonne roundnose grenadier landed and {{as a percentage of the}} total catch when compared with those of previous years showed no appreciable change. The main species discarded were rabbitfish, <b>birdbeak</b> <b>dogfish,</b> Baird's smoothhead, roundnose grenadier and Lepidion eques. Catch per unit effort rates expressed as kg caught per hour fished compared with rates for previous trawl surveys showed marked declines. Length frequency distributions for the main chondrichthyan species showed absence of smaller individuals from the samples and sexual dimorphism with respect to length. Attachment of fine-mesh cod-end liner suggested that the commercial gear selects all length frequencies present and that mesh size may not be an effective management measure in this fishery. This leaflet documents the survey and presents some preliminary results. The data from this survey are currently under analysis at the FRC and results will be published in the scientific literature...|$|E
40|$|Mastigoteuthid squids are ecologically important, being prey to many apex predators, yet the {{diversity}} and systematics of the family remain poorly understood. Delicate by nature, they are often damaged during capture; {{this has led to}} a controversial and unstable taxonomy for this family. Recent reviews have accepted one or two genera, and eight to 17 species. A complete taxonomic review of the New Zealand mastigoteuthids is undertaken here first time. A morphological revision of New Zealand material was completed to identify and describe locally occurring species, and to re-evaluate the status of the genera in this family. Morphological examinations focused on both internal and external anatomy. A set of morphological characters have been identified to distinguish five genera: Mastigoteuthis [Mt. ], Idioteuthis, Mastigopsis [Mp. ], Echinoteuthis, and Magnoteuthis [Mg. ]. Eight species were identified: Mt. dentata, Mt. psychrophila, Mt. sp. X, Mt. sp. Y, I. cordiformis, Mp. hjorti, Mg. sp. nov., and E. famelica. The Mastigoteuthidae now appears to be second most diverse squid family in New Zealand waters. Three mitochondrial genes (16 S rRNA, 12 S rRNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I [COI]) were analysed for eight different species, in order to assess the utility of DNA barcodes to differentiate between species and to test the morphological hypothesis for the division of the five genera. Genetic evidence was found that supports Mg. sp. nov. as a distinct species that has been previously misidentified as the morphologically similar species Mg. magna. Each species analysed herein exhibited unique mitochondrial DNA haplotypes for all genes, and the morphological distinction between the genera was strongly supported using a combined phylogeny with all genes. However, I. cordiformis grouped with the chiroteuthids. Of the three genes examined, the DNA barcode region shows the greatest divergence between species and should be used in future systematic work on the Mastigoteuthidae. Because most mastigoteuthid specimens are badly damaged, integrative taxonomy is especially important for this family. Unfortunately, most specimens are formalin fixed, rendering DNA extraction difficult or impossible. Therefore, some preliminary tests were conducted on DNA from formalin-fixed museum specimens. Two sequences were recovered out of eight specimens tested using a silica-gel column-based extraction, with critical-point-dried tissue and a DNA purification protocol. The third sequence was recovered using an alkaline lysis extraction, with non-critical-point-dried tissue and without DNA purification. The sequences that were recovered showed a close relationship between Mt. agassizii, Mt. dentata, and Mt. sp. X. Idioteuthis cordiformis is the largest mastigoteuthid squid species and may currently be facing the potential of a local extinction in New Zealand; however, its ecology has not been previously studied. Therefore, stable isotopes 15 N and 13 C were analysed to find the trophic position and the source of carbon, respectively, and gut contents were examined using DNA barcoding. Stable isotopes revealed a correlation between δ 15 N and δ 13 C values, and I. cordiformis δ 15 N indicated that it occupies a high trophic position. Morphological analysis was not successful in identifying prey items below class, while DNA barcoding was able to identify two prey species: snapper (Lutjanus sp.), and <b>birdbeak</b> <b>dogfish</b> (Deania calcea). Although a review of the systematics of the New Zealand Mastigoteuthidae has been completed, a full review of this family is still required; an integrative taxonomic approach will be essential because there is often low interspecific and high intraspecific morphological variation. This will require continued collection efforts for new specimens, along with further research into DNA extraction from formalin-fixed tissue. In addition, future studies should also focus on the dietary habits and trophic position of mastigoteuthids in order to better understand their ecological importance...|$|E
