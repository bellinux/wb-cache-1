5|$|<b>Black</b> <b>American</b> Sign Language (BASL) or Black Sign Variation (BSV) is a dialect of American Sign Language (ASL) {{used most}} {{commonly}} by deaf African Americans in the United States. The divergence from ASL was influenced {{largely by the}} segregation of schools in the American South. Like other schools at the time, schools for the deaf were segregated based upon race, creating two language communities among deaf signers: White deaf signers at White schools and Black deaf signers at Black schools. Today, BASL is still used by signers in the South despite public schools having been legally desegregated since 1954.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, the United States {{established}} military {{ties with}} Liberia by sending some five <b>black</b> <b>American</b> officers to help reorganize the force. The LFF {{in its early}} years was frequently recruited by inducing men from the interior forcibly. When dispatched to the interior to quell tribal unrest, units often lived off the areas that they were pacifying, as a form of communal punishment. The Force's officers were drawn from either the coastal aristocracy or tribal elites.|$|E
5|$|James {{was born}} on December 22, 1964, in Toronto, Ontario. She is the {{daughter}} of Donna Barrato, a white Canadian from Toronto, and Leo James, a <b>black</b> <b>American</b> from Mississippi who came to Canada to escape racial segregation. She has two half-brothers and two half-sisters on her mother's side. Her father, who was involved with a Toronto nightclub, estimates she has at least nine half-siblings by him, though James believes the number is closer to 15. Among them is National Hockey League (NHL) player Theo Peckham.|$|E

40|$|Although many {{scholars}} have theorized about how {{responding to the}} stress of blocked opportunities can affect the well-being of <b>black</b> <b>Americans,</b> few schol-ars have empirically examined the relationships between striving efforts, personal goals, and mental health among <b>black</b> <b>Americans.</b> This investigation examines the relationship between goal-striving stress and mental health in a national sample of <b>black</b> <b>Americans.</b> Results indicate that goal-striving stress is significantly related to lower levels of happiness, life satisfaction, self-esteem, {{and higher levels of}} psychological distress. We find that poverty status moder-ates the relationship between goal-striving stress and mental health. Compared to poorer persons, individuals above poverty with high goal-striving stress have significantly lower levels of happiness and life satisfaction. Overall, the findings provide a more complete context for understanding associations among socio-economic status, goal-striving stress, and adverse mental health outcomes among <b>black</b> <b>Americans.</b> 92 Achieving the “American Dream ” of finan-cial success and stability represents a nearly unquestioned socially valued goal for many in the United States. <b>Black</b> <b>Americans,</b> despite facing substantial obstacles, fully endorse the aspiration of upward social mobility, and many fully expect to succeed (Hochschild 1995). At the same time, even more <b>black</b> <b>Americans</b> have had their dreams of success-ful advancement thwarted by racial discrimi-nation. For these <b>black</b> <b>Americans,</b> the disap-pointment of blocked opportunity is particu-larly painful because it often results in struc-tural disadvantages and psychological distress engendered by racism, prejudice, and discrim-ination (Williams 1998). In fact, few other stress scenarios have re-ceived as much theoretical attention from re-searchers attempting to place the appropriate sociopolitical context around the struggles <b>black</b> <b>Americans</b> face in their efforts to share in the material wealth of the United States (Cos...|$|R
5|$|Angelou was {{challenged}} by her friend, author James Baldwin, and her editor, Robert Loomis, {{to write an}} autobiography that was also a piece of literature. Reviewers often categorize Caged Bird as autobiographical fiction because Angelou uses thematic development and other techniques common to fiction, but the prevailing critical view characterizes it as an autobiography, a genre she attempts to critique, change, and expand. The book covers topics common to autobiographies written by <b>Black</b> <b>American</b> women {{in the years following}} the Civil Rights Movement: a celebration of Black motherhood; a critique of racism; the importance of family; and the quest for independence, personal dignity, and self-definition.|$|E
5|$|Endometrial cancer appears most {{frequently}} during perimenopause (the period just before, just after, and during menopause), {{between the ages}} of 50 and 65; overall, 75% of endometrial cancer occurs after menopause. Women younger than 40 make up 5% of endometrial cancer cases and 10–15% of cases occur in women under 50years of age. This age group is at risk for developing ovarian cancer at the same time. The worldwide median age of diagnosis is 63years of age; in the United States, the average age of diagnosis is 60years of age. White American women are at higher risk for endometrial cancer than <b>black</b> <b>American</b> women, with a 2.88% and 1.69% lifetime risk respectively. Japanese-American women and American Latina women have a lower rates and Native Hawaiian women have higher rates.|$|E
5|$|The later 19th {{century was}} a high point {{in the history of}} civil rights for African Americans. Reconstruction for a time limited the power of former slaveholders in Texas. Leaders, such as George T. Ruby and Norris Wright Cuney, worked to {{establish}} educational and employment opportunities for blacks and organize black voters to support the Republican Party, then the main party supporting black rights in the South. Cuney's efforts led to higher employment and higher wages for blacks in the city, especially on the wharves, and eventually led to combined black and white trade unions during the 1890s and early 1900s. Cuney himself rose to the chairmanship of the Texas Republican Party, the most powerful position held by any <b>black</b> <b>American</b> in the 19th century.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1960s, some theaters in North Carolina only allowed white Americans, while others segregated white and <b>black</b> <b>Americans</b> by assigning them into different sections in the theater.

50|$|Among <b>black</b> <b>Americans,</b> {{education}} correlates {{to support}} for euthanasia. <b>Black</b> <b>Americans</b> without a four-year degree {{are twice as}} likely to oppose euthanasia than those with at least that much education. Level of education, however, does not significantly influence other racial groups in the US. Some researchers suggest that <b>black</b> <b>Americans</b> tend to be more religious, a claim that is difficult to substantiate and define. Only <b>black</b> and white <b>Americans</b> have been studied in extensive detail. Although it has been found that minority groups are less supportive of euthanasia than white Americans, there is still some ambiguity as to what degree this is true.|$|R

Born in 1968, Tricky grew up in Knowle West in the 1970s and 1980s and was educated at Merrywood School. He named his 2008 album Knowle West Boy in tribute to the area's influence on him and his music. Boxer Dixie Brown lived in Knowle West from the 1930s until the 1950s and was a regular at the Venture Inn, a public house in Melvin Square. He was frequently visited by <b>black</b> <b>American</b> troops during World War II. The Eagles were a rock and roll band who formed in the late 1950s at the Eagle House youth club and featured in the 1962 film Some People.|$|E
5|$|When the war ended, Du Bois {{traveled}} to Europe in 1919 {{to attend the}} first Pan-African Congress and to interview African-American soldiers for a planned book on their experiences in World War I. He was trailed by U.S. agents who were searching for evidence of treasonous activities. Du Bois discovered {{that the vast majority}} of <b>black</b> <b>American</b> soldiers were relegated to menial labor as stevedores and laborers. Some units were armed, and one in particular, the 92nd Division (the Buffalo soldiers), engaged in combat. Du Bois discovered widespread racism in the Army, and concluded that the Army command discouraged African Americans from joining the Army, discredited the accomplishments of black soldiers, and promoted bigotry.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 Chicago {{experienced}} {{two major}} race riots. Triggered by Civil Rights struggles and angst, more riots followed {{in subsequent years}} and the Black Power movement came into fruition. Artists began to explore ways to express black pride, self-determination and self-reliance leading in 1966 to the Organization of <b>Black</b> <b>American</b> Culture (OBAC). Artist Norman Parish asked Jarrell to attend a meeting for OBAC's Artists' Workshop. The meetings would consist of artists bringing their work to be critiqued and reflect on ideas of the black experience in art, leading to the concept behind Wall of Respect. The mural consisted of African American heroes and personalities, each artist deciding who should be depicted in their section. Sylvia Abernathy designed the layout, giving Jarrell a 12 × 14 foot space to share with photographer Bill Abernathy. Jarrell focused on a favorite theme, rhythm and blues, and featured portrayals of James Brown, B.B. King, Billie Holiday, Muddy Waters, Aretha Franklin and Dinah Washington. The Artists' Workshop would sour {{towards the end of}} the project: there were controversies stemming from the painting in Norman Parish's section, conflicts regarding copyrights being sold without permission, disagreements on law enforcement involvement, as well as deceit. Nevertheless the Wall was considered a success, triggering the creation of liberation themed murals in Chicago and beyond.|$|E
