In 1965 a review by Bryan Magee for Encounter observed that the book had hung on in libraries as an adventure tale for children, but regretted that it was neglected by adults. The review recognised that perhaps its greatest interest was now the insight it gave as to Churchill's beliefs as a young man.

25|$|In November 2014 U.S. President Obama {{expanded}} the original role of U.S. Armed Forces in Afghanistan for 2015. Originally {{they were supposed}} to advise, train and assist the Afghan Forces and to hunt the remnants of Al Qaeda. Under the president’s order U.S. forces can carry out missions against the Taliban and other militant groups threatening American troops or the Afghan government while American jets, bombers and drones can support Afghan troops on combat missions. By the end of 2015, half of the 9,800 American troops would leave Afghanistan. The rest would be consolidated in Kabul and Bagram, and then leave by the end of 2016, allowing Obama to say he ended the Afghan war before leaving office. The United States could still have military advisers in Kabul after 2016 who would work out of an office of security cooperation at the United States Embassy. But the Obama administration has not said how large that contingent might <b>be</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> its exact mission would be.|$|E

Poirot visits it and finds Miss Carnaby, her invalid sister, Emily and a Pekingese dog, Augustus. They {{are part of a}} scam run by women who are companions to rich and ungrateful ladies. These women are poorly paid, without talent and will be cast adrift when they get older. The dog that is taken out for a walk is their own, Augustus, who is let off his lead and is able to find {{his way back to the}} sister's flat unaided, thus providing witnesses to the 'crime'. The 'subject' of the kidnap is held at the sister's flat and their owner told of the ransom. Quite often it is the companion who is sent out with the envelope of pound notes which goes into a general pool for all the companions involved in the scheme. Miss Carnaby feels guilty for her crime but excuses it on the basis of the way they are treated by their employers – only the other day Lady Hoggin accused her of tampering with her tonic as it tasted unpleasant. Poirot tells them their activities must stop and that the money must be returned to Lady Hoggin although he is sure that he will be able to persuade her husband not to involve the police.|$|E

Keith McDuffee of TV Squad described the third season as [...] "disappointing", mainly because the episodes offered nothing new: [...] "most fans of Veronica Mars felt that season three was clearly its weakest." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN said that the main issue was the shift in the overall tone, with a lighter feeling than the previous seasons. He felt that Logan had been most affected by the tone change, robbed of his darker aspects and changed into an [...] "increasingly extraneous character." [...] Goldman felt that despite the concerns over final five episodes, the series ended with [...] "three very strong episodes, with lots of strong dialogue and Veronica proving again just how tough she can <b>be,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> a strong character she is." [...] Goldman concluded that although the third season [...] "was very choppy", it still had [...] "plenty of witty dialogue and a continually engaging performance by Kristen Bell as the title character." [...] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette opined that Veronica Mars had taken a dive [...] "creatively", from [...] "the mopier version of its theme song to stalled storylines." [...] The reviewer felt that [...] "the arcing mysteries had grown less convincing and compelling {{as time went on}} and were too drawn out." [...] Fox News Channel's Bridget Byrne pointed out that Veronica had [...] "gone from punky to—dare we say—preppy" [...] in the third season.

[...] Emma's relationship with Will will continue to grow, as [...] "she has these moments of clarity when she's talking to Will because he calms her." [...] Mays described her in an interview with TheTVChick: [...] "She is a romantic at heart. But she’s practical. She’s very interesting, because she does have those dreams and hopes of finding the right man. And in her mind, even though Will Schuester’s married, that sort of guy is like the perfect guy for her. She’s very practical in the fact that she doesn’t want to be alone and she knows that she’s somewhat limited in a small town to men. And Ken Tanaka is a very nice man, he’s not exactly like Will, but he’s good to her and he’s solid. He’s got a job, and he understands her and he understands all her quirks and stuff. So she’s practical, she knows that just might be her lot in life. So it’s weird. She’s got this very dreamy side about her and who she wants to <b>be</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> she wants her life to be like. But she’s also got this very practical, down-to-earth, well this is kind of the best I can do thing. It’s funny {{a lot of people have}} thought that part about her is weak. Like a weak character flaw, but I actually don’t think that’s true. I really just think that’s the practical side of her. I think that’s her being practical. And I think a lot of people are like that sometimes." ...|$|E
