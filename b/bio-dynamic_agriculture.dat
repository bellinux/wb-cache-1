It was Rudolf Steiner's "Agriculture Course" delivered at Koberwitz (now Kobierzyce, Poland) in 1924, that {{laid the foundation for}} the establishment of <b>Bio-Dynamic</b> <b>Agriculture</b> - a organic farming method now practised in 38 countries...|$|E
5000|$|Howard {{advocated}} {{studying the}} forest {{in order to}} farm like the forest. He devoted {{the last half of}} his career to understanding that end, presaging those contemporary ecologists who advocate the understanding of the interface between ecology and agriculture. Indeed, Howard is grouped, along with Rudolf Steiner, Sir Robert McCarrison and Richard St. Barbe Baker, as one of the key progenitors of the organic agriculture movement. (However he says, in the Preface to 'An Agricultural Testament', 'Some attention has also been paid to the <b>Bio-Dynamic</b> methods of <b>agriculture</b> in Holland and in Great Britain, but I remain unconvinced that the disciples of Rudolf Steiner can offer any real explanation of natural laws or have yet provided any practical examples which demonstrate the value of their theories.') ...|$|R
5000|$|In July 1939, Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, {{the author}} of the {{standard}} work on biodynamic <b>agriculture</b> (<b>Bio-Dynamic</b> Farming and Gardening), came to the UK at the invitation of Walter James, 4th Baron Northbourne as a presenter at the Betteshanger Summer School and Conference on Biodynamic Farming at Northbourne's farm in Kent. One of the chief purposes of the conference was to bring together the proponents of various approaches to organic agriculture in order that they might cooperate within a larger movement. Howard attended the conference, where he met Pfeiffer. In the following year, Northbourne published his manifesto of organic farming, Look to the Land, in which he coined the term [...] "organic farming." [...] The Betteshanger conference has been described as the 'missing link' between biodynamic agriculture and other forms of organic farming.|$|R

Based on former methodological investigation (Zalecka 2006) {{the aim of the}} study is to show the aging effect and to test, whether a once taken sample represents the farm. Result: the repeatedly taken samples seem to be equal, but variation in the climatic conditions of the chamber as well as aging of the solution have a tremendous influence on the pictures and must be standardised...|$|E
40|$|Pests shun healthy plants. Pesticides weaken plants. Weakened plants {{open the}} door to pests and disease. Hence {{pesticides}} precipitate pest attack and disease susceptibility, and thus they induce a cycle of further pesticide use. This is the essence of Trophobiosis Theory, a thesis presented by Francis Chaboussou, an agronomist of the France’s National Institute of Agricultural Research (INRA), in “Healthy Crops: A New Agricultural Revolution”. After two decades, this important book is finally available in English. Plant pathologist Chaboussou (b. 1908 - d. 1985) saw with a clear eye that just as there are iatrogenic, doctor-caused, medical problems, likewise there are agrogenic, farmer-caused, agricultural problems. Chaboussou offers a lifetime’s insight into his vision for an agriculture without pesticides, and in so doing he offers a scientific underpinning for organic and <b>bio-dynamic</b> <b>agriculture.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|This year marks a centenary of the {{synthetic}} fertilizer industry. German chemists, Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch, in 1909 demonstrated their industrial {{process for the}} manufacture of ammonia. The achievement won them accolades including Nobel Prizes. The output of their Haber-Bosch process {{can be used for}} either peace or war, agriculture or munitions, and the rapid adoption by Germany of this industrial process is credited with prolonging WW 1. Most of {{the synthetic}} nitrogenous fertilizer of the past century, and right up to the present, has been manufactured using the Haber-Bosch process. The use of synthetic fertilizers has led to significant negative environmental outcomes. Rudolf Steiner was an early voice against chemical agriculture. Steiner's Agriculture Course of 1924 led to the development and world-wide proliferation of <b>Bio-dynamic</b> <b>Agriculture,</b> a farming system which has always championed the biological fixation of nitrogen by soil micro-organisms. This paper identifies ten key differences between biological and Haber-Bosch chemical fixation of nitrogen...|$|E
40|$|Ehrenfried Pfeiffer (1899 - 1961) was 25 {{years old}} when Rudolf Steiner (1861 - 1925) {{delivered}} his eight lectures on agriculture from 7 th June to 16 th June 1924. In those eight lectures at Koberwitz, Rudolf Steiner laid the basis for biodynamic agriculture. Steiner advocated an agriculture informed by anthroposophy, and that the ideas he expounded in the eight agriculture lectures should be developed by experiments, practice and observation. Ehrenfried Pfeiffer took up this task and he {{spent the rest of}} his life in the pursuit. Pfeiffer published his book ‘Bio-Dynamic Farming and Gardening’ in 1938. It was the first popular account of <b>bio-dynamic</b> <b>agriculture.</b> In that book Pfeiffer presented the practical results of more than a decade of farming practice and experimentation. Pfeiffer was a major contributor to Australia’s first organic farming journal, the 'Organic Farming Digest' (1946 - 1955); he was the leading contributing author from the USA. Pfeiffer's lecture tour to Australia planned for 1953, and visiting the states of NSW, Victoria, and South Australia, was cancelled at short notice due to his ill health...|$|E
