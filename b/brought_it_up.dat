5|$|After Bullecourt, the 4th Brigade withdrew to Ribemont, where {{reinforcements}} <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to strength. During this period, Murray oversaw musketry training {{before being}} granted convalescent leave to London in May. While in the capital, he {{was decorated with}} his Victoria Cross and Distinguished Service Order by King George V in Hyde Park on 2 June 1917. Promoted major on 12 July, he rejoined his battalion later in the month, and during the 4th Brigade's advance to the Hindenburg Line over subsequent months, was involved in actions at Messines, Ploegstreert Wood, Menin Road, Polygon Wood, Broodseinde, Poelcappelle and Passchendaele. For his actions at Passchendaele, Murray garnered a mention in Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig's dispatch of 7 November 1917.|$|E

He was accused by the You're Fired panel of being a snake, and was mocked for his extremely defensive responses to the interviewers' questions, with Michael McIntyre also mocking his CV.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1870s to early 1880s, spread of arc lighting, {{a type of}} {{brilliant}} outdoor street lighting that required high voltages {{in the range of}} 3000-6000 volts, was followed by one story after another in newspapers about how the high voltages used were killing people, usually unwary linemen, a strange new phenomenon that seemed to instantaneously strike a victim dead without leaving a mark. One of these accidents, in Buffalo, New York on August 7, 1881, led to the inception of the electric chair. That evening a drunken dock worker, looking for the thrill of a tingling sensation he had noticed before, managed to sneak his way into a Brush Electric Company arc lighting power house and grabbed the brush and ground of a large electric dynamo. He died instantly. The coroner who investigated the case <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> at a local Buffalo scientific society. Another member, Alfred P. Southwick, a dentist who had a technical background, thought some application could be found for the curious phenomenon.|$|E
500|$|Over {{two games}} in April 2006, Pujols hit home runs in four {{consecutive}} plate appearances, making him the 20th player to accomplish the feat. Pujols maintained after the game {{that he was more}} concerned with winning than the numbers: [...] "I don't look at numbers", he said. [...] "I don't know. I didn't know anything about [...] until you guys <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> Because that's not me. I don't get locked in on numbers. I don't get locked in on anything like that. I get locked in on seeing the ball and helping my team out to win and hopefully doing some damage out there." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> at {{some point}} because the song that the title came from was 'Dusty', but my title for it was 'Down on the Upside', but Ben wrote the music and he called it 'Dusty'. So since we don't really like having song titles being {{the title of the}} record, 'cause it brings this weird, undue focus to the song, I thought it would be cool to call it Down on the Upside. We started {{thinking}} about all these other titles, and worrying about them describing the whole record without excluding anything... So it was the last minute and we were at a photo shoot for Spin and someone called and said, 'We need your title now so we can start doing the record package,' so Matt [...] brought up the title again, and everyone went, 'yeah, that's it.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Brooks played Beverley Allitt in a BBC1 docu-drama called Beverley Allitt: Angel of Death, {{alongside}} Ian Kelsey. Producer Cathy Elliot said, [...] "It's a {{very sensitive}} issue and of course it's terrible for the parents to have the whole thing <b>brought</b> <b>up.</b> Each time <b>it's</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> <b>it's</b> painful, {{but a lot of}} parents realise it's important it's kept in the public domain and that people are aware that things have happened and that not a lot has been done since".|$|R

500|$|Once {{the units}} had been transferred, their members {{had to decide}} whether they would re-enlist in the Territorial Force; the {{threshold}} for recognition was given as 30% of the establishment strength. By 5 May, the War Office had recognised 85% of the Yeomanry, 78% of the Artillery, 59% of the Engineers and 84% of the Infantry units; the total enlistment was 28% of establishment. By 1 June, the total enlistment was 48% of establishment, and the first summer camp was organised. By the end of 1908, the Territorial Force stood at 68% of establishment strength, and a popular recruiting campaign in the following spring led by the Daily Mail <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to 88%. In the summer of 1909, a new Territorial reserve force, the [...] "Veteran Reserve", was announced; it began recruiting in 1910, and by the beginning of 1913 contained almost 200,000 men.|$|E
500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{started its}} closing speech by {{drawing attention to}} the [...] "cool and calculating" [...] {{manner in which the}} children were killed. [...] Knight also argued that the accused could not have shared the same delusion, and only <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> during the trial. [...] The [...] "cunning and deliberation" [...] displayed in the acts could not have been done by a deluded person. [...] Tan helped Lim because [...] "she loved [...] ", and Hoe was simply misled into helping the crimes. [...] Urging the judges to consider the ramifications of their verdict, Knight said: [...] "My Lords, to say that Lim was less than a coward who preyed on little children because they could not fight back; killed them in the hope that he would gain power or wealth and therefore did not commit murder, is to make no sense of the law of murder. [...] It would lend credence to the shroud of mystery and magic he has conjured up his practices and by which he managed to frighten, intimidate and persuade the superstitious, the weak and the gullible into participating in the most lewd and obscene acts." ...|$|E
500|$|The River Dee branch heads eastwards {{from the}} river, and passes through two locks {{before turning to}} the north. Another two locks raise its level {{to that of the}} Ellesmere Canal, and the {{junction}} was the site of a historic boatyard. Originally, the branch continued eastwards after the first two locks, and another two <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> {{to the level of the}} Chester Canal main line. From the junction, the Ellesmere main line headed south, to another right-angled band where it joined the Chester Canal. There are moorings at Tower Wharf, just before the bend. To the south of the canal is the old city, one of the few English cities which retains nearly all of its city walls, the cathedral much of which dates from 1092, and the King Charles' Tower, which overshadows the canal. After rising [...] through the Northgate Staircase locks, which were cut out of solid rock, the canal enters a steep-sided rock cutting. After several bridges, the first of five locks which raise the level of the canal by another [...] is reached.

2500|$|Bill [...] "Bojangles" [...] Robinson (May 25, 1878 ‚Äì November 25, 1949) was an American tap {{dancer and}} actor, {{the best known}} and most highly paid African-American {{entertainer}} {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century. His long career mirrored changes in American entertainment tastes and technology. [...] He started in the age of minstrel shows and moved to vaudeville, Broadway, the recording industry, Hollywood, radio, and television. According to dance critic Marshall Stearns, [...] "Robinson's contribution to tap dance is exact and specific. He <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> on its toes, dancing upright and swinging", giving tap a [...] "‚Ä¶hitherto-unknown lightness and presence." [...] His signature routine was the stair dance, in which Robinson would tap up and down a set of stairs in a rhythmically complex sequence of steps, a routine that he unsuccessfully attempted to patent. Robinson is also credited with having introduced a new word, copacetic, into popular culture, via his repeated use of it in vaudeville and radio appearances.|$|E

[...] Mari's history, written {{in the second half}} of the 12th century, ends with the reign of the patriarch  øAbdisho ø III (1139‚Äì48).

2500|$|In 1859 Captain William Irving (18161872) {{became a}} partner in the Victoria Steam Navigation Company that {{provided}} ferry service between New Westminster and Victoria. The Irving family lived for a time in Victoria then in New Westminster. In 1882 William's son Captain John Irving (18541936), then 28, ordered the construction of the R.P. Rithet sternwheeler to expand his fleet of the Pioneer Line. R.P. Rithet was constructed by Alexander Watson's shipbuilding company in Victoria. Later in 1882 Irving helped to form the Canadian Pacific Navigation Company (CPNC) and the Pioneer Line ceased to exist. The following year John Irving was made the general manager of the CPNC and he ordered the purchase of the Yosemite from California and <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to Vancouver to serve as a ferry from Vancouver to Victoria.

[...] The GOP also carried local elections in 47 of 49 towns, leaving the party in a much better position than the previous year. The Democrats losing local offices in ten communities. In the city, the Democratic slate only carried the district attorney and controller slate by about 54%. O'Brien won statewide and Republicans were confident they could retake the governorship and U.S. senate seat up for grabs in 1962. After the election, Eyre commented: [...] "Philadelphia has long tried to move into Delaware County through the wage tax. The reapportionment question was just another form of potential annexation. But, why he (Green) <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> again is a mystery; it certainly wasn't smart politically." [...] In December, 1961, with no action having been taken by the time the legislature adjourned, a group of local Democrats, led by Upper Providence Justice of the Peace Donald Kahn, proposed its own redistricting plan. The Democrats' map kept Philadelphia separate from the suburbs and moved eleven northern and western Delaware County communities, as well as five Montgomery County towns, to the Ninth Congressional District in Chester County, which would be separated from Lancaster County. The Seventh District would have consisted of the southern and eastern tier of the county and would have had a population of 422,000.|$|E
