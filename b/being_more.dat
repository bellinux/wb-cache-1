5|$|Current {{official}} transit {{maps of the}} New York City Subway {{are based}} on a 1979 design by Michael Hertz Associates. The maps are not geographically accurate due to the complexity of the system (i.e. Manhattan being the smallest borough, but having the most services), but they do show major city streets as an aid to navigation. The newest edition took effect on June 27, 2010, and makes Manhattan bigger and Staten Island smaller. Earlier diagrams of the subway (the first being produced in 1958), while <b>being</b> <b>more</b> aesthetically pleasing, had the perception of <b>being</b> <b>more</b> geographically inaccurate than the diagrams today. The design of the subway map by Massimo Vignelli, published by the MTA between 1972 and 1979, has become a modern classic but the MTA deemed the map flawed due to its placement of geographical elements.|$|E
