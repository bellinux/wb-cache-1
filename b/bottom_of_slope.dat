40|$|We {{present the}} {{application}} of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) for the monitoring and characterization of an active landslide area in Val Canaria (Ticino, Southern Swiss Alps). At catchment scale, the study area is affected by a large Deep Seated Gravitational Slope Deformation (DSGSD) area presenting, in the lower boundary, several retrogressive landslides active since the 1990 s. Due to its frequent landslide events this area was periodically monitored by TLS since 2006. Periodic acquisitions provided new information on 3 D displacements at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> and the detection of centimetre to decimetre level scale changes (e. g. rockfall and pre-failure deformations). In October 2009, a major slope collapse occured {{at the bottom of}} the most unstable area. Based on the comparison between TLS data before and after the collapse, we carried out a detailed failure mechanism analysis and volume calculation...|$|E
40|$|Local Name: Işıklar KöyüLatitude: 37. 42. 03. 90 Longitude: 28. 42. 23. 61 Elevation: 505. 21 mDescription: A {{farmstead}} {{is found}} in hills above Işıklar village. A modern farm there is terraced with wheat and olive trees, two fields of each. Tile and pottery remains found all over the slope. Two counterweight blocks (A 036) are on the second and fourth terraces. No evidence of walls is seen at the site, but at base of the hill {{is a place where}} schist appears to have been quarried, and probably ancient schist wall blocks are used in the modern field walls. This site offers a good vantage point over the valley. The pottery indicates an early date for the settlement; finds include a molded bowl fragment, an echinus bowl rim, and LCW fragments. There is also a column fragment found at <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope,</b> made from white and blue breccia. Finds: Systematic pottery collection on 5 / 30 / 200...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} seismic {{liquefaction}} related to artificial fill embankment is complicated. In this study, by making using of Finn model, a typical artificial fill embankment was simulated {{by means of}} Finn model in FLAC. Numerical simulation {{results indicated that the}} pore water pressure of saturated sand soil increased extremely which resulted in the significant decrease of the effective stress. When the effective stress decreased approximately to zero, the liquefaction phenomena occurred. According to the change of pore water pressure at different locations and depths, three rules have been obtained. Firstly, the occurrence time for the first peak of pore water pressure coincided with the seismic peak acceleration of input wave. Secondly, the liquefaction occurred earlier in the upper layer of saturated sand soil than in the lower layer below the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope.</b> However the duration of liquefaction in the lower layer of saturated sand soil was longer than in the upper layer. Thirdly, the upper layer of saturated sand soil was almost not liquefiable below the top of slope, while the lower layer was easily liquefiable with long duration time. In summary, the characteristics of seismic liquefaction in the artificial fill embankment were closely related to the seismic wave, locations and depths of saturated sand soil in a slope. 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers...|$|E

5000|$|The term soil catena {{is used to}} {{describe}} the lateral variation in soils over a hillslope. 29 A slope can be broken into sections known as a ridge, crest, midslope, and toeslope.

Steeper <b>slope</b> or crest sections tend to be freely drained, while at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>slopes</b> or toeslopes there is usually higher in moisture content due to poor drainage.7 Toeslope soils are not only higher in moisture content, but are also known to be richer in clay and organic matter.2 ...|$|R

50|$|In 1892, Achnashellach was {{the scene}} of a runaway train in which the brake in the brakevan had malfunctioned. Subsequently, this train moved off down the slope at {{considerable}} speed without a locomotive to keep it under control. Reaching the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>slope,</b> it had enough energy to proceed back uphill, before running down the slope once again. Unfortunately, another train was approaching Achnashellach in the opposite direction at that very moment, and the two trains collided at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>slope</b> with great force, resulting in several injuries in what was a rare accident for the Highland Railway. The cause of the accident was thought to be a result of the HR's lack of using a continuous brake, and a habit of putting goods wagons at the front of mixed passenger and goods trains.|$|R
