5|$|The video had {{its world}} premiere on MTV during prime time on March 31, 1983 though {{it should be}} noted that neither <b>Beat</b> <b>It</b> nor Billie Jean was, as is often claimed, the first music video by an African-American artist to be played on MTV. Soon after its premiere the video was also running on other video {{programs}} including BET's Video Soul, SuperStation WTBS's Night Tracks, and NBC's Friday Night Videos. In fact, <b>Beat</b> <b>It</b> was the first video shown on the latter's first ever telecast on July 29, 1983.|$|E

5|$|According to The Economist, Apollo {{succeeded in}} {{accomplishing}} President Kennedy's goal {{of taking on}} the Soviet Union in the Space Race, and <b>beat</b> <b>it</b> by accomplishing a singular and significant achievement, and thereby showcased {{the superiority of the}} capitalistic, free-market system as represented by the US. The publication noted the irony that in order to achieve the goal, the program required the organization of tremendous public resources within a vast, centralized government bureaucracy.|$|E
5|$|Three {{publishers}} praised The Well {{but turned}} it down. Hall's agent then sent the manuscript to Jonathan Cape who, though cautious about publishing a controversial book, saw {{the potential for}} a commercial success. Cape tested the waters with a small print run of 1500 copies, priced at 15 shillings– about twice the cost of an average novel– to make it less attractive to sensation-seekers. Publication, originally scheduled for late 1928, was brought forward when he discovered that another novel with a lesbian theme, Compton Mackenzie's Extraordinary Women, was to be published in September. Though the two books proved to have little in common, Hall and Cape saw Extraordinary Women as a competitor and wanted to <b>beat</b> <b>it</b> to market. The Well appeared on 27 July, in a black cover with a plain jacket. Cape sent review copies only to newspapers and magazines he thought would handle the subject matter non-sensationally.|$|E
25|$|Nelson today {{compete in}} the Hawke Cup, which is played below {{first-class}} level. Nelson have won the competition several times, and hold {{the record for the}} longest period of holding the trophy, from December 1958 to February 1965. In 1963-64, defending their title against Waikato, they made 632, a Hawke Cup record. The record stood until Nelson <b>beat</b> <b>it</b> in 1983-84, when they scored 641 for seven defending their title against Taranaki. In their next match, in 1984-85, they <b>beat</b> <b>it</b> again, scoring 649 against Wairarapa. The record stood until Manawatu <b>beat</b> <b>it</b> with 650 all out in 1993-94.|$|E

25|$|Richmond were {{dominant}} in 1972 and were hot favourites in the 1972 VFL Grand Final against Carlton. However, Carlton stunned Richmond {{in a game}} of ridiculous high scoring. Even Richmond equalled the then record highest score in a Grand Final of 22.18 (150), but Carlton <b>beat</b> <b>it</b> with 28.9 (177). Richmond got their revenge in an intensely physical clash in the 1973 VFL Grand Final and went back-to-back in 1974 with a strong win against a resurgent North Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|USC had a 41-game {{winning streak}} against UCLA from 1932 to 1943, a {{national}} record that stood until UCLA eventually <b>beat</b> <b>it</b> in 1980 with a 42nd consecutive win against Cal, {{on the way}} to a 52-game winning streak, the current NCAA record of one opponent over another. UCLA Defeated USC 42–37 in the first of the two final home games in the 1943 season to break the streak. This is still the third-longest streak of one Division 1 opponent against another.|$|E

25|$|Also, Worcestershire {{became the}} fifteenth {{county in the}} County Championship, debuting with an 11-run loss to Yorkshire despite earning a 78-run lead on first innings. George Wilson took eight for 70 in the first innings, which was a Worcestershire Championship record until Wilson <b>beat</b> <b>it</b> against Somerset in 1905. The debutants {{finished}} twelfth, though they only earned two wins in 12 games. Finally, Sussex' Ranjitsinhji became the first batsman to hit 2000 runs in a Championship season with 102 against Lancashire in August.|$|E
25|$|Another {{question}} is whether, {{if there was}} a perceptible <b>beat,</b> <b>it</b> was heard at regular intervals as in modern western music, or irregularly. Gratwick argues that the ictus was not isochronous, but that the timing depended on whether the anceps syllables were long or short. His view is that so far from attempting to make the word accent match the ictus, Roman writers often deliberately tried to avoid such coincidence, especially {{at the beginning and end}} of the line, to avoid monotony.|$|E
25|$|Codrington {{played in}} four of Canada's other five matches in that World Cup, but did not manage to repeat his success, picking up only one more wicket and {{suffering}} the humiliation of playing in the side bowled out for 36 by Sri Lanka; this was the lowest-ever ODI total until Zimbabwe <b>beat</b> <b>it</b> by one run in 2004. Further appearances at List A level followed in the 2003–04 Red Stripe Bowl and 2004 ICC Six Nations Challenge, {{as well as the}} non-List A ICC Americas Championship.|$|E

25|$|The waltz (El vals) {{arrived in}} Cuba by 1814. It {{was the first}} dance in which couples were not linked by a {{communal}} sequence pattern. It was, and still is, danced in 3/4 time with the accent on the first <b>beat.</b> <b>It</b> was originally thought scandalous because couples faced each other, held {{each other in the}} 'closed' hold, and, so to speak, ignored the surrounding community. The waltz entered all countries in the Americas; its relative popularity in 19th-century Cuba is hard to estimate.|$|E
25|$|Since 2011, however, {{ratings of}} The X Factor {{have been in}} sharp decline. It was {{overtaken}} in the rating battle by Strictly Come Dancing during series 8 and has since very rarely managed to <b>beat</b> <b>it,</b> with Strictly Come Dancing extending its lead over the show per year. In 2016, The X Factor was beaten head-to-head in some live shows by other BBC programmes, such as Michael McIntyre's Big Show and Planet Earth II. The ratings crisis has worsened {{in the following year}} with the show recording its lowest ever figures and Strictly Come Dancing now enjoying nearly three times the audience figures of The X Factor in most weeks.|$|E

25|$|The group {{begins to}} {{investigate}} the victims, hoping to understand {{the mind of the}} murderer by understanding his victims. They interview Georgio Santorelli's mother and discover, for example, that there was discord in his family. Georgio's parents had learned of his being manipulated into performing sexual acts for older boys in school, and the father's response was to try to <b>beat</b> <b>it</b> out of the boy. Georgio eventually left home and lived on the streets as a male-for-male prostitute. They also read the emerging science of psychology, such as the works of William James. Another body is discovered, and the evidence suggests that the victim knew his attacker. The team also deduces that the killer's agility on rooftops suggests that he is familiar with mountain- or rock-climbing.|$|E
25|$|On 30 June 2011, Tamgho {{achieved}} {{an outdoor}} jump of 17.91 m at the 2011 IAAF Diamond League Athletissima athletics meeting in Lausanne.

Tamgho fractured his right ankle while warming {{up for the}} qualification round of the 2011 European Under-23 Championships that was held in Ostrava in July 2011. He was thus forced {{to pull out of}} the upcoming 2011 World Championships in Daegu and for the rest of the year he did not take part in any athletics event held after the 2011 European Under-23 Championships in Ostrava. He underwent surgery on his fractured right ankle in the second half of 2011.|$|E
25|$|Watford played 26 {{competitive}} away {{matches in}} 2009–10. The match against Newcastle at St James' Park on Saturday 5 December 2009 attracted 43,050 spectators. This {{was the largest}} crowd at any Watford match that season, although this was aided {{in part by the}} fact that they did not play at another stadium with the capacity to <b>beat</b> <b>it.</b> Another notable away fixture was the match at Madejski Stadium against Reading. Brendan Rodgers, Watford's manager for the second half of 2008–09, left Watford for Reading under controversial circumstances in June, having previously stated that his integrity was being questioned when linked with the managerial vacancy. Reading's matchday squad also featured three former Hornets, two of whom had played for Watford under Rodgers. The match attracted 3,389 Watford fans, and ended in a 1–1 draw, with ex-Watford player Grzegorz Rasiak scoring Reading's goal, and Jobi McAnuff and Brynjar Gunnarsson also playing a part.|$|E
