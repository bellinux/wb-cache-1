The thesis is divided into several parts. In the introduction the thesis is concerned with an analysis of the Labour Law itself, with its position and function in a system of law.

[...] While recognising that there was insufficient epidemiological data to establish whether the victims' injuries arose from a [...] "common cause", or from airborne contamination or from the reclamation works, the judge ruled that there was a [...] "statistically significant cluster" [...] of birth defects in Corby which needed [...] "explanation other than chance": it was not the court's purpose to establish whether the victims were individually exposed to contaminants from the reclamation, rather to determine whether any relevant breach of duty had the ability to cause injuries of the type complained of. The judge also ruled that it was [...] "reasonably foreseeable that the local population might be exposed to hazardous or contaminated substances" [...] {{as a result of the}} council's clean-up programme.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{addition}} to penalties imposed for <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>statutory</b> <b>duties</b> {{in the event}} of workplace accidents involving physical harms, New Zealand’s Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992 also provides for penalties where accidents have not occurred. Ordinary negligence rules are ex post in that both an accident and harm must occur before liability accrues, whereas ex ante liability rules create liability for deficient care per se. This paper examines whether liability for <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> duty that do not give rise to accidents have a useful incentive-enhancing role for health and safety decisions by employers in the New Zealand context when used in conjunction with ex post liability rules. We argue that ex post rules by themselves are insufficient to induce appropriate levels of precaution due to the combined presence of weak penalties and considerable uncertainty surrounding the Courts’ required standard of care. Merely augmenting ex post liability with ex ante liability, however, is unlikely to induce desirable levels of employer precautions. Further, more strict ex ante standards than socially optimal precaution levels may be desirable since inspection probabilities, prosecution rates, and penalties for <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> ex ante standards are relatively low, providing some justification for the relatively stringent safety regulations and required standard of care observed in New Zealand. Nevetheless, a weaker but less uncertain standard may instead induce a small degree of overprecaution, removing the need for ex ante regulations from this particular perspective...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} vindicatory damages should be {{available}} in the child welfare tort cases against public authorities. These are cases in which the plaintiffs sue public authorities either for not protecting them from harm when they were children, or where it is alleged that the authority’s employees abused the children while in its care. Vindicatory damages would be intended to mark the wrong to the plaintiff, rather than attempting to compensate the consequences. This thesis argues in support of the availability of a separate head of vindicatory damages in tort law, including negligence, and explores some of the liability issues which arise in these cases, including vicarious liability, liability for omissions and liability in negligence for the way in which a statutory power is exercised or for a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> a <b>statutory</b> <b>duty.</b> New Zealand's accident compensation scheme is also discussed: it is argued that vindicatory damages in tort law should not be barred by the scheme...|$|R

However, a 2011 pollution event involving a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> the <b>statutory</b> <b>duty</b> to report a pollution incident {{as soon as practicable}} by a company proved to be a defining moment for the EPA.

This article considers the incident and subsequent case law regarding the duty to report, and its impact on the EPA 2 ̆ 7 s image as a regulator. It argues that the case law has potentially undone the purpose behind the legislative amendments and the duty to report; namely, to ensure that regulators are quickly made aware of pollution incidents.

40|$|The {{flurry of}} {{criticism}} over {{the addition of}} the responsible corporate officer provision to the Clean Air Act has focused on its application of strict liability and the mens rea requirement. Dotterweich and Park both applied what appeared to be strict liability for violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. The fear was that non-culpable corporate officers would be held strictly liable, face not misdemeanor sanctions but the most severe felony penalties. This fear was unfounded. No corporate officer was held strictly liable; public welfare offenses evolved as the courts conscientiously applied the “knowing” requirement to environmental statutes and the RCO provision. However, traditional criminal law theory and case law support another use of the RCO provision, one in which the statute is the source of a duty for a corporate officer who is in responsible relation to a public danger: the duty to actively seek out to prevent or remedy violations. This paper will explore the value of defining the RCO provision as the actus reus of a crime—the omission or <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> a <b>statutory</b> <b>duty.</b> This theory can further the environmental regulatory program by deterring would be violators and by increasing compliance, a value that exists {{despite the fact that the}} RCO provision is rarely used to prosecute corporate officers. Part II will trace the evolution of criminal provisions and {{the addition of the}} responsible corporate officer clause in environmental statutes. Part III will the follow the case law that has slowly evolved. Part IV will discuss why the RCO provision is not used more often, and how it nevertheless serves an important function in environmental law.

50|$|Sandside Bay is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. It is {{recognised}} by surfers {{as being}} {{home to a}} powerful high quality left-hand reef break. This, however, is extremely fickle, and requires very particular wind, swell, and tide conditions to come into shape. The break is also notorious for being very rocky, shallow, and dangerous, such is the irregular form of the reef upon which the wave breaks. One of the main environmental issues caused by the Dounreay Nuclear Power Development Establishment are radioactive nuclear fuel particles that have been released from the site into the sea, and {{are now on the}} seabed near the plant and in Sandside Bay. Some of these are being washed ashore, including a small number on the privately owned Sandside Bay beach which {{is open to the public}} and is part of the 10000 acre Sandside Estate. The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs committed to clean up and open oversight of the work on 25 October 2006. http://www.sandsideestate.com/pressRelease.asp?releaseId=537 The Dounreay Particles Advisory Group recommended that the particle monitoring frequency of the beach should be increased to fortnightly. http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectionCode=132&storyCode=2040484. The 13th Laird of Sandside the Duke of Portland took the Government to Court to assert his ownership down to the low watermark of the estate granted by a barony of 1628 and won. The 19th Laird of Sandside since 1991, Geoffrey Minter, following the radioactive contamination beginning in 1997, took the Government owned UKAEA to court in 2003 and won, beyond appeal, a judicial review in Scotland's highest court proving radioactive damage to the estate's land and the UKAEA to be in <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> its <b>statutory</b> <b>duty</b> under the Nuclear Installations Act.

2500|$|While {{the modern}} scheme of {{legislation}} and regulation engenders {{a comprehensive approach}} to enforcement and worker participation for health and safety matters, the common law remains relevant for getting civil law compensation, and some limits on an employers' duties. Although the legislative provisions are not automatic, <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> a <b>statutory</b> <b>duty</b> is evidence that a civil law duty has been breached. Injured employees can generally claim for loss of income, and relatives or dependents recover small sums to reflect distress. In principle, employers are vicariously liable for all actions of people acting {{for them in the}} [...] "course of employment" [...] whenever their actions have a [...] "close connection" [...] to the job, and even if it breaks an employer's rules. Only if an employee is on a [...] "frolic of his own", and the employer cannot be said to have placed him in a position to cause harm, will the employer have a defence. Under the Employers’ Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969, employers must take out insurance for all injury costs, and insurance companies are precluded by law and practice from suing their employees to recover costs unless there is fraud. However, until the mid-20th century there were a series of major limitations. First, until 1937, if an employee was injured by a co-worker, the doctrine of common employment, the employer could only be liable if it was shown they were personally liable by carelessness in selecting staff. The House of Lords changed this in Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co Ltd v English, holding an employer had a non-delegable duty of care for all employees. Lord Wright held there were [...] "fundamental obligations of a contract of employment... for which employers are absolutely responsible". The second old restriction was that, until 1891, volenti non fit injuria meant workers were assumed to voluntarily accept the dangers of their work by agreeing to their contracts of employment. Only if an employee callously ignores clear directions of the employer will he be taken to have voluntarily assumed the risk, like in ICI Ltd v Shatwell where an experience quarry shotfirer said he [...] "could not be bothered" [...] to wait 10 minutes before setting of a detonation, and blew up his brother. Third, even if a worker was slightly at fault, until 1945 such contributory negligence precluded the whole of the claim. Now the court will only reduce damages by the amount the employee contributed to their own injury. The fourth defence available to employers, which still exists, is ex turpi causa non oritur actio, that if the employee was engaged in any illegal activity they may not claim compensation for injuries. In Hewison v Meridian Shipping Services Pte Ltd Mr Hewison concealed his epilepsy so that he could work offshore was technically guilty of illegally attempting to gain a pecuniary advantage by deception under the Theft Act 1968 section 16. After being struck in the head by a defective gangplank he suffered worse fits than before, but the Court of Appeal, by a majority, held his illegal act precluded any compensation.|$|R
