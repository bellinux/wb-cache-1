40|$|Abstract Background Along {{with high}} {{affinity}} <b>binding</b> of epibatidine (K d 1 ≈ 10 pM) to α 4 β 2 {{nicotinic acetylcholine receptor}} (nAChR), low affinity <b>binding</b> of epibatidine (K d 2 ≈ 1 - 10 nM) to an independent <b>binding</b> site has been reported. Studying this low affinity <b>binding</b> {{is important because it}} might contribute understanding about the structure and synthesis of α 4 β 2 nAChR. The <b>binding</b> behavior of epibatidine and α 4 β 2 AChR raises a question about interpreting <b>binding</b> data from two independent sites with ligand depletion and nonspecific <b>binding,</b> both of which can affect equilibrium <b>binding</b> of [3 H]epibatidine and α 4 β 2 nAChR. If modeled incorrectly, ligand depletion and nonspecific <b>binding</b> lead to inaccurate estimates of <b>binding</b> constants. Fitting total equilibrium <b>binding</b> as a function of total ligand accurately characterizes a single site with ligand depletion and nonspecific <b>binding.</b> The goal {{of this study was to}} determine whether this approach is sufficient with two independent high and low affinity sites. Results Computer simulations of <b>binding</b> revealed complexities beyond fitting total <b>binding</b> for characterizing the second, low affinity site of α 4 β 2 nAChR. First, distinguishing low-affinity specific <b>binding</b> from nonspecific <b>binding</b> was a potential problem with saturation data. Varying the maximum concentration of [3 H]epibatidine, simultaneously fitting independently measured nonspecific <b>binding,</b> and varying α 4 β 2 nAChR concentration were effective remedies. Second, ligand depletion helped identify the low affinity site when nonspecific <b>binding</b> was significant in saturation or competition data, contrary to a common belief that ligand depletion always is detrimental. Third, measuring nonspecific <b>binding</b> without α 4 β 2 nAChR distinguished better between nonspecific <b>binding</b> and low-affinity specific <b>binding</b> under some circumstances of competitive <b>binding</b> than did presuming nonspecific <b>binding</b> to be residual [3 H]epibatidine <b>binding</b> after adding a large concentration of cold competitor. Fourth, nonspecific <b>binding</b> of a heterologous competitor changed estimates of high and low inhibition constants but did not change the ratio of those estimates. Conclusions Investigating the low affinity site of α 4 β 2 nAChR with equilibrium <b>binding</b> when ligand depletion and nonspecific <b>binding</b> are present likely needs special attention to experimental design and data interpretation beyond fitting total <b>binding</b> data. Manipulation of maximum ligand and receptor concentrations and intentionally increasing ligand depletion are potentially helpful approaches. </p...|$|R
40|$|Ligand-protein <b>binding</b> {{processes}} are essential in biological systems. A well-studied {{system is the}} <b>binding</b> of cyclic adenosine monophosphate to the cyclic nucleotide <b>binding</b> domain of the bacterial potassium channel MloK 1. Strikingly, the measured on-rate for cyclic adenosine monophosphate <b>binding</b> is two orders of magnitude slower than a simple Smoluchowski diffusion model would suggest. To resolve this discrepancy and to characterize the ligand-binding path in structural and energetic terms, we calculated 1100 ligand-binding molecular dynamics trajectories and tested two scenarios: In the first scenario, the ligand transiently binds to the protein surface and then diffuses along the surface into the <b>binding</b> site. In the second scenario, only ligands that reach the protein surface {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>binding</b> site proceed into the <b>binding</b> site. Here, a <b>binding</b> funnel, which increasingly confines the translational as well as the rotational degrees of freedom, determines the <b>binding</b> pathways and limits the on-rate. From the simulations, we identified five surface <b>binding</b> states and calculated the rates between these surface <b>binding</b> states, the <b>binding</b> site, and the bulk. We find that the transient <b>binding</b> of the ligands to the surface <b>binding</b> states does not affect the on-rate, such that this effect alone cannot explain the observed low on-rate. Rather, by quantifying the translational and rotational degrees of freedom and by calculating the <b>binding</b> committor, our simulations confirmed the existence of a <b>binding</b> funnel as the main bottleneck. Direct <b>binding</b> via the <b>binding</b> funnel dominates the <b>binding</b> kinetics, and only ∼ 10 % of all ligands proceed via the surface into the <b>binding</b> site. The simulations further predict an on-rate between 15 and Math Eq, which agrees with the measured on-rate...|$|R
