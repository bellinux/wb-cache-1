5|$|Daniel Judson Callaghan (July 26, 1890– November 13, 1942) was a United States Navy {{officer who}} {{received}} the Medal of Honor posthumously for his actions during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. In a career spanning just over 30 years, he served his country in two wars. He served on several ships during his first 20 years of service, including escort duties during World War I, and also filled some shore-based administrative roles. He later {{came to the attention}} of US President Franklin Roosevelt, who appointed Callaghan as his Naval Aide in 1938. A few years later, he returned to command duties during the early stages of World War II. Callaghan was killed by an enemy shell on the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> flagship, the , during a surface action against a larger Japanese force off Savo Island. The battle ended in a strategic victory for the Allied side.|$|E
5|$|For {{extraordinary}} heroism and conspicuous intrepidity {{above and}} {{beyond the call of duty}} during action against enemy Japanese forces off Savo Island on the night of 12–13 November 1942. Although out-balanced in strength and numbers by a desperate and determined enemy, Rear Admiral Callaghan, with ingenious tactical skill and superb coordination of the units under his command, led his forces into battle against tremendous odds, thereby contributing decisively to the rout of a powerful invasion fleet and to the consequent frustration of a formidable Japanese offensive. While faithfully directing close-range operations in the face of furious bombardment by superior enemy fire power, he was killed on the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Flagship. His courageous initiative, inspiring leadership, and judicious foresight in a crisis of grave responsibility were in keeping with the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life in the defense of his country.|$|E

He was a knock-kneed, shambling young man, naturally devoid of creed or reverence, with a longing for absolute power which his undesirable district gratified.|$|R
25|$|On 12 September 1944, Oldendorf {{commanded}} {{from the}} <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> flagship, , the Fire Support Group tasked with the bombardment of Peleliu in the Palaus island group. This Fire Support Group consisted of five battleships, the , , , , and , eight cruisers, twelve destroyers, seven minesweepers, fifteen landing craft converted to rocket launchers, and a half-dozen submarines. At {{this point in}} his career, Oldendorf was an experienced battle commander who had handled similar assignments in three previous Marine landings. The bombardment was scheduled to last 3 days. By {{the end of the first}} day, aerial reconnaissance photos indicated that close to 300 of the assigned targets had been destroyed or seriously damaged by the all-day bombardment and that virtually every aboveground structure and fortification had been wiped out. At the airport its few usable planes were reduced to wreckage.|$|E
500|$|The first {{character}} Nomura {{designed for}} Final Fantasy VIII, Squall {{was inspired by}} actor River Phoenix, although Nomura said that [...] "obody understood it." [...] Squall is [...] tall, initially with longer hair and a more feminine appearance. After objections by game director Yoshinori Kitase, Nomura made the character more masculine. He added the scar across Squall's brow and the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> nose impulsively (to make the character more recognizable), leaving the description of its origin up to scenario writer Kazushige Nojima. Squall's first illustration {{was used as a}} set up to create the world around him. The logo of the game which had Squall embracing Rinoa was left as an open interpretation for fans who still had not played the game. The scar in Squall's forehead was also left ambiguous although Nomura said it was important for him.|$|E
500|$|Much of Albert Victor's time at {{his post}} in Aldershot was spent drilling, which he disliked, {{though he did}} like to play polo. He passed his examinations, and in March 1887, he was posted to Hounslow where he was {{promoted}} to captain. He was given more public engagements, visited Ireland and Gibraltar, and opened the Hammersmith suspension <b>bridge.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>his</b> private life, a childhood friend of Albert Victor later recalled that it was uneventful: [...] "his brother officers had said {{that they would like to}} make a man of the world of him. Into that world he refused to be initiated." [...] However, letters dated 1885 and 1886 from Albert Victor to his doctor at Aldershot (known only as [...] "Roche") detail that he was taking medicine for 'glete' (gleet), then a term for gonorrhea discharge.|$|E

500|$|From June 1932 Murray was {{assigned}} {{for a year}} to Naval Service Headquarters in Ottawa as a Naval Staff Officer before setting back to sea for two years, leading the small fleet of East Coast destroyers from the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> first operational command [...] At this point, in mid-1934, Murray was appointed to a new position of Senior Naval Officer, Halifax, a position that combined the Commander of the East Coast with the Command of the Naval Dockyard in Halifax. In June 1936 Murray {{was sent back to}} the UK to work in the Admiralty Operations Division, and in December 1936 he started his final tour with the Royal Navy serving as Executive Officer aboard the former battleship , where he participated in the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review. In August 1938, {{in the middle of a}} final year at the Imperial Defence College, Murray was promoted to Captain, and so it was that, on the eve of World War II when the Royal Navy was mobilized, Murray returned to Ottawa as a Captain, and Director Naval Operations and Training.|$|E
500|$|Kitase {{expressed}} a desire to give the game a foreign atmosphere ("foreign" [...] being in relation to Japan); his objective with the environment was to create a largely European setting. The first character Nomura designed specifically for use in Final Fantasy VIII was Squall, initially giving him longer hair and a more feminine appearance. However, Yoshinori Kitase did not feel that this design worked and asked Nomura to shorten his hair and make him look more masculine, which led to the design seen in-game. When designing Cloud Strife, Nomura gave him distinctly spiky, bright blonde hair to emphasize his role as that game's protagonist. With Squall, Nomura wanted to try a unique angle to establish his role, giving him the characteristic gunblade scar across the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> nose. A complete history was not yet conceived, so Nomura left the explanation for Squall's scar to Nojima. Squall's design was flourished by a fur lining along the collar of his jacket, included for the purpose of challenging the game's full motion video designers. This is but one example of the demands he has consistently extended to the programmers of the Final Fantasy series as technology has advanced.|$|E
500|$|To {{maintain}} a foreign atmosphere, {{the characters of}} the game were designed to have predominantly European appearances. The first Final Fantasy VIII character created was Squall. Desiring to add a unique angle to Squall's appearance and emphasize {{his role as the}} central character, Nomura gave him a scar across his brow and the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> nose. As there was not yet a detailed history conceived for the character, Nomura left the explanation for Squall's scar to scenario writer Kazushige Nojima. Squall was given a gunblade, a fictional revolver–sword hybrid that functions primarily as a sword, with an added damaging vibration feature activated by use of its gun mechanism, similar to a vibroblade. His character design was complemented by a fur lining along the collar of his jacket, incorporated by Nomura as a challenge for the game's full motion video designers. Additionally, some designs Nomura had previously drawn, but had not yet used in a Final Fantasy game, were incorporated into Final Fantasy VIII. These were the designs of Edea, Fujin and Raijin. The latter two had originally been designed for use in Final Fantasy VII, but with the inclusion of the Turks characters in that game, it was felt that Fujin and Raijin were unnecessary. Nomura had designed Edea before the development of Final Fantasy VII, based on the style of Yoshitaka Amano. For the Guardian Forces, Nomura felt they should be unique beings, without clothes or other human-like concepts. This was problematic, as he did not want them to [...] "become the actual monsters", so he took great care in their design. Leviathan was the first GF, created as a test and included in a game demo. After it received a positive reaction from players, Nomura decided to create the remaining sequences in a similar fashion.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{descriptions}} {{said that}} Siegel {{was shot in}} the eye, he was actually hit twice {{on the right side of}} his head. The death scene and postmortem photographs show that one shot penetrated his right cheek and exited through the left side of his neck; the other struck the right <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> nose where it met the right eye socket. The pressure created by the bullet passing through Siegel's skull blew his left eye out of its socket. A Los Angeles' Coroner's Report (#37448) states the cause of death as cerebral hemorrhage. His death certificate (Registrar's #816192) states the manner of death as a homicide and the cause as [...] "Gunshot Wounds of the head." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{structure}} {{was the third}} {{in a series of}} three large wrought iron bridges built {{in the middle of the}} nineteenth century and was influenced by the preceding two, both of which had been designed by Robert Stephenson. The two central sections of Brunel's bridge are novel adaptations of the design Stephenson employed for the High Level Bridge across the River Tyne in Newcastle Upon Tyne in 1849. Brunel was present when Stephenson raised the girders of his Britannia Bridge across the Menai Strait in the same year. From 1849 to 1853 Brunel was erecting an iron <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own; the Chepstow Bridge carried the South Wales Railway across the River Wye and featured a main truss of [...] with a curving tubular main member and three conventional plate-girder approach spans of , a similar solution to that adopted for crossing the River Tamar at Saltash.|$|E

5000|$|Othmar Ammann {{designed}} {{more than}} half <b>of</b> the eleven <b>bridges</b> that connect New York City {{to the rest of}} the United States. His talent and ingenuity helped him create the two longest suspension <b>bridges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> time. Ammann was known for being able to create bridges that were light and inexpensive, yet they were still simple and beautiful. He was able to do this by using the deflection theory. He believed that the weight per foot of the span and the cables would provide enough stiffness so that the bridge would not need any stiffening trusses. This made him popular during the depression era when being able to reduce the cost was crucial. Famous bridges by Ammann include the following: ...|$|R
