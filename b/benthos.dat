5|$|Aside {{from the}} large numbers of organisms {{actually}} consumed by the walrus, its foraging has a large peripheral impact on benthic communities. It disturbs (bioturbates) the sea floor, releasing nutrients into the water column, encouraging mixing and movement of many organisms and increasing the patchiness of the <b>benthos.</b>|$|E
5|$|The aquatic larvae {{are found}} {{in a wide variety}} of {{habitats}} such as streams, rivers, lakes, ponds, spring seeps and temporary waters (vernal pools). The larvae of many species use silk to make protective cases, which are often strengthened with gravel, sand, twigs, bitten-off pieces of plants, or other debris. The larvae exhibit various feeding strategies, with different species being predators, leaf shredders, algal grazers, or collectors of particles from the water column and <b>benthos.</b> Most adults have short lives during which they do not feed.|$|E
5|$|The {{quantity}} of benthic macroinvertebrates at sites in Tangascootack Creek has been {{measured by the}} West Branch Susquehanna Restoration Coalition using different systems. These sites included designations T-1 and T-2the main creek just {{above and below the}} entry of Muddy Run, respectivelyand T-3 which is further downstream from T-2. Total taxa richness, as measured by the organization, ranged from 3 at sites T-2 and T-3 to 7 at site T-1, with an average of 4.3. The EPT Taxa Richness (measured on a scale of 0 to 4) ranged from 0 at sites T-2 and T-3 to 2 at site T-1, with an average of 0.7. The scores of the sites according to version 3 of the Beck’s Index (twice the number of pollution-intolerant <b>benthos</b> taxa plus the number of facultative <b>benthos</b> taxa) ranged from 0 at sites T-2 and T-3 to 6 at site T-1. On the Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (a method of determining a stream's ecosystem quality based on its benthic macroinvertebrates), the sites ranged from 3.538 for site T-1 to 6.2 for site T-2, with an average of 5.024. On the Shannon index, the sites ranged from 0.950 at site T-2 to 1.925 at site T-3, with an average of 1.325.|$|E
5|$|Pleuronectiformes (flatfish) are {{an order}} of ray-finned fish. The most obvious {{characteristic}} of the modern flatfish is their asymmetry, with both eyes {{on the same side}} of the head in the adult fish. In some families the eyes are always on the right side of the body (dextral or right-eyed flatfish) and in others they are always on the left (sinistral or left-eyed flatfish). The primitive spiny turbots include equal numbers of right- and left-eyed individuals, and are generally less asymmetrical than the other families. Other distinguishing features of the order are the presence of protrusible eyes, another adaptation to living on the seabed (<b>benthos),</b> and the extension of the dorsal fin onto the head.|$|E
5|$|Caddisfly larvae can {{be found}} in all feeding guilds in {{freshwater}} habitats. Most early stage larvae and some late stage ones are collector-gatherers, picking up fragments of organic matter from the <b>benthos.</b> Other species are collector-filterers, sieving organic particles from the water using silken nets, or hairs on their legs. Some species are scrapers, feeding on the film of algae and other periphyton that grows on underwater objects in sunlight. Others are shredder-herbivores, chewing fragments off living plant material while others are shredder-detritivores, gnawing at rotting wood or chewing dead leaves that have been pre-processed by bacteria and fungi; most of the nutrients of the latter group come from consumption of the bacteria and fungi. The predatory species either actively hunt their prey, typically other insects, tiny crustaceans and worms, or lie in wait for unwary invertebrates to come too close. A few species feed opportunistically on dead animals or fish, and some Leptoceridae larvae feed on freshwater sponges.|$|E
5|$|Peracarid crustaceans, {{including}} isopods, {{are known}} to form {{a significant part of}} the macrobenthic community that is responsible for scavenging on large food falls onto the sea floor. In 2000, scientists of the Diversity of the deep Atlantic <b>benthos</b> (DIVA 1) expedition (cruise M48/1 of the German research vessel RV Meteor III) discovered and collected three new species of the Asellota suborder of benthic isopods from the abyssal plains of the Angola Basin in the South Atlantic Ocean. In 2003, De Broyer et al. collected some 68,000 peracarid crustaceans from 62 species from baited traps deployed in the Weddell Sea, Scotia Sea, and off the South Shetland Islands. They found that about 98% of the specimens belonged to the amphipod superfamily Lysianassoidea, and 2% to the isopod family Cirolanidae. Half of these species were collected from depths of greater than 1000meters.|$|E
25|$|There are {{records of}} 68 taxa of zooplankton, in {{addition}} to phytoplankton, consolidated and non-consolidated <b>benthos.</b>|$|E

25|$|Benthopelagic fish {{inhabit the}} water {{just above the}} bottom, feeding on <b>benthos</b> and zooplankton. Most {{demersal}} fish are benthopelagic.|$|E
25|$|In sites without {{adequate}} currents {{there can be}} an accumulation of heavy metals on the <b>benthos</b> (seafloor) near the salmon farms, particularly copper and zinc.|$|E
25|$|The main diet of {{deep sea}} benthic fish is {{invertebrates}} {{of the deep}} sea <b>benthos</b> and carrion. Smell, touch and lateral line sensitivities {{seem to be the}} main sensory devices for locating these.|$|E
25|$|Kaikō {{reached a}} maximum depth of 10,911.4 meters at the Challenger Deep on 24 March 1995, during its initial sea trials. At that time, the craft {{collected}} video {{and photographs of}} various barophilic <b>benthos,</b> including tubeworms and shrimp.|$|E
25|$|The {{diversity}} of marine <b>benthos,</b> i.e. the organisms living near the seabed, though interrupted by some collapses and plateaus {{has increased from}} the Cambrian to the Recent. Furthermore, {{there is no evidence}} to suggest that saturation has been reached (Jablonski 1999).|$|E
25|$|The {{redirection}} {{of carbon}} by C. amurensis to the <b>benthos</b> {{has created a}} limited chain, leaving the pelagic web depauperate. Detrital production from clam excretion and death may fuel bacterial production, which may be circulated into the detrital food web, or microbial loop.|$|E
25|$|HERMIONE aims {{to provide}} {{quantitative}} {{estimates of the}} potential consequences of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning, to examine how deep-sea <b>benthos</b> adapt to large-scale changes, and, for the first time, to create conceptual models integrating deep-sea biodiversity and quantitative analyses of ecosystem functioning and processes.|$|E
25|$|The lake {{contains}} both phytoplankton and zooplankton, such as Copepoda and Cladocera. The <b>benthos</b> species include Crustacea, Oligochaeta, Diptera and Bivalvia. In addition {{are several}} species of fish, including Salvelinus salvelinus, Coregonus lavaretus and Salmo salar. The lake {{is known for its}} Vättern char, as it is called, Salvelinus alpinus.|$|E
25|$|Jellyfish {{have not}} been {{prevalent}} in the estuary until recently. In East Coast estuaries such as Chesapeake Bay, they are often top-level predators, feeding indiscriminately on both fish and zooplankton. Several small invasive taxa {{have been identified in}} the LSZ and freshwater regions. These species strobilate in summer, but maintain polyps in the <b>benthos</b> year round.|$|E
25|$|In the Gulf of Odessa, 23 {{items are}} {{identified}} in the diet of the round goby. Mytilus galloprovincialis, Setia pulcherrima, Mytilaster lineatus, Lentidium mediterraneum, Idotea balthica, and Alitta (Nereis) succinea dominate in the spring. In summer are mainly Sphaeroma pulchellum and L. mediterraneum. The mussels M. galloprovincialis and M. lineatus are important in all seasons. The polychaetes are most elected component of <b>benthos.</b>|$|E
25|$|Herbivory also removes {{phytoplankton}} {{from the}} water column. While the pelagic food web is based upon phytoplankton production, most of this production is diverted to the <b>benthos</b> via predation by the introduced Amur River clam (Corbula amurensis). Levels of phytoplankton biomass declined by {{an order of magnitude}} after the widespread introduction of C. amurensis in the mid-1980s, and have not rebounded.|$|E
25|$|Notably, {{the high}} {{clearance}} {{rate of the}} introduced Amur River clam Potamocorbula amurensis population has produced a ten-fold decline in plankton density, resulting in a carbon trap in the <b>benthos</b> and an assumed increase in waste detrital production. This waste is hypothesized to fuel the microbial loop, resulting {{in an increase in}} microzooplankton such as the copepod Limnoithona tetraspina, which utilize rotifers and ciliates.|$|E
25|$|In the South Africa, {{the snail}} has colonized {{different}} types of habitat, from rivers, lakes and irrigation canals to concrete lined reservoirs and ornamental ponds. It reaches very high densities, up to 21 000 m², {{and is likely to}} impact on the entire indigenous <b>benthos</b> of the natural waterbodies of the region – more so than any other invasive freshwater invertebrate known from the South Africa. The South African indigenous thiarids Thiara amarula, Melanoides tuberculata, and Cleopatra ferruginea are considered particularly vulnerable.|$|E
25|$|Limnoithona tetraspina {{has become}} the numerically {{dominant}} cyclopoid copepod since its introduction in 1993. It feeds primarily upon ciliates and microflagellates, but unlike P. forbesi, it is relatively impervious to predation by clams or fish, hence its abundance. Energetically, L. tetraspina may be a dead end for the food web; these copepods are either advected {{out of the system}} by tides and currents, or die and fall down to the <b>benthos,</b> where they may be available to the microbial loop, or to detritivores.|$|E
25|$|Benthic fishes {{are likely}} to be found, and are more diverse, on the {{continental}} slope, where there is habitat diversity and often food supplies. About 40% of the ocean floor consists of abyssal plains, but these flat, featureless regions are covered with sediment and largely devoid of benthic life (<b>benthos).</b> Deep sea benthic fishes are more likely to associate with canyons or rock outcroppings among the plains, where invertebrate communities are established. Undersea mountains (seamounts) can intercept deep sea currents, and cause productive upwellings which support benthic fish. Undersea mountain ranges can separate underwater regions into different ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|On the {{continental}} slope, demersal fishes are common. They are more diverse than coastal demersal fish, {{since there is}} more habitat diversity. Further out are the abyssal plains. These flat, featureless regions occupy about 40 percent of the ocean floor. They are covered with sediment but largely devoid of benthic life (<b>benthos).</b> Deep sea benthic fishes {{are more likely to}} associate with canyons or rock outcroppings among the plains, where invertebrate communities are established. Undersea mountains (seamounts) can intercept deep sea currents, and cause productive upwellings which support benthic fish. Undersea mountain ranges can separate underwater regions into different ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|The {{remediation}} of Homebush Bay {{is important}} because of {{its impact on the}} food chain which extends through <b>benthos</b> not only to local protected and threatened species of birds, but also to JAMBA and CAMBA protected species and species which use other Ramsar-protected wetlands. Ultimately human health is affected through the food chain. Homebush Bay has a complete fishing ban, there is a commercial fin fishing ban west of the Gladesville Bridge, and based on submissions of the remediator and NSW Waterways and EPA the complete fishing ban ought be extended to the whole of the Parramatta River west of Homebush Bay and at least as far east as the Ryde Traffic Bridge.|$|E
25|$|Some early ichthyosaurs were durophagous and had flat convex teeth {{adapted for}} {{crushing}} shellfish. They thus ate <b>benthos</b> {{from the floor}} of more shallow seas. Other species were perhaps suction feeders, sucking animals into their mouths by quickly opening their relatively short jaws. This was first assumed for Shonisaurus, which giant by this means might have secured a constant food supply for its huge body, and in 2011 for the short-snouted Guanlingsaurus liangae. However, in 2013 a study concluded that the hyoid bone of ichthyosaurs, at the tongue base, was insufficiently ossified to support a sucking movement and suggested the alternative that such species were ram feeders, gathering food by constantly swimming forwards with a wide open mouth.|$|E
25|$|Species {{introductions}} {{have been}} increasing {{since at least}} the 19th century as a function of increasing trade and traffic. Introductions include numerous taxa, including copepods, shrimp, amphipods, bivalves, fish and both rooted and floating plants. Many pelagic species have been introduced most recently through ballast water releases from large ships directly into the estuary. As a result, many of these introduced species originate from estuaries around the Pacific Rim, particularly copepods such as P. forbesi and L. tetraspina. The Amur River clam originates from Asia, and has created significant and drastic changes to the ecology of the LSZ, primarily by diverting pelagic food to the <b>benthos</b> and into an accelerated microbial loop.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the largest}} fish today, the whale sharks and basking sharks, Leedsichthys problematicus derived its {{nutrition}} as a suspension feeder, using {{an array of}} specialised gill rakers lining its gill basket to extract zooplankton, small animals, from the water passing through its mouth and across its gills. It is less clear whether also phytoplankton, algae, {{were part of the}} diet. Leedsichthys could have been a ram feeder, making the water pass through its gills by swimming, but could also have actively pumped the water through the gill basket. In 2010, Liston suggested that fossilised furrows discovered in ancient sea floors in Switzerland and attributed to the activity of plesiosaurs, had in fact been made by Leedsichthys spouting water through its mouth to disturb and eat the <b>benthos,</b> the animals dwelling in the sea floor mud.|$|E
500|$|The faunal {{distribution}} {{consists of}} Zooplanktons, <b>Benthos</b> and Fish. Zooplankton {{found in the}} lake include Keratella cochlearis, K. serrulata, Polyactis vulgaris, Brachionus plicatilis, Monostyla bulla, Alona monocantha, Cyclops ladakanus and Mesocyclops leukarti. <b>Benthos</b> ...|$|E
500|$|The bluespotted {{stingray}} has a flat disc-like rhomboid body up to [...] {{in diameter}} and [...] in total length. Their coloring is a dark green with blue spots with a light white underbelly also known as countershading. Its snout is very short and broadly angular along with its angular disc. The rays' bright coloration serves as a warning for its venomous spines. The ray has a very long tail accommodating two venomous spines {{on the base of}} the tail. The tail is about twice as long as the body of the ray, and the barbs or spines are two different sizes, one being very large and the other a medium-sized barb. The bluespotted stingray has bright yellow eyes that are positioned to allow them a wide angle of view. Since the gills are located ventrally, the spiracles allow water to reach the gills while resting or feeding on the <b>benthos.</b> The spiracles are located directly behind the eyes. The mouth is located on the ventral side of the body, which promotes the unique foraging technique of stingrays. Rays are normally solitary individuals but can occur in groups. One unique characteristic of the bluespotted stingray is that they rarely bury themselves in the sand, only to hide from predators, unlike the majority of stingrays who bury themselves regularly to hunt.|$|E
500|$|A {{variety of}} audacious but equally {{impractical}} schemes were put forward during the 1970s. One proposal called for 180,000 tons of molten wax (or alternatively, Vaseline) to be pumped into Titanic, lifting {{her to the}} surface. Another proposal involved filling Titanic with ping-pong balls, but overlooked {{the fact that the}} balls would be crushed by the pressure long before reaching the depth of the wreck. A similar idea involving the use of <b>Benthos</b> glass spheres, which could survive the pressure, was scuppered when the cost of the number of spheres required was put at over $238 million. An unemployed haulage contractor from Walsall named Arthur Hickey proposed to turn Titanic into an iceberg, freezing the water around the wreck to encase it in a buoyant jacket of ice. This, being lighter than liquid water, would float to the surface and could be towed to shore. The BOC Group calculated that this would require half a million tons of liquid nitrogen to be pumped down to the sea bed. In his 1976 thriller Raise the Titanic!, author Clive Cussler's hero Dirk Pitt repairs the holes in Titanics hull, pumps it full of compressed air and succeeds in making it [...] "leap out of the waves like a modern submarine blowing its ballast tanks", a scene depicted on the posters of the subsequent film of the book. Although this was an [...] "artistically stimulating" [...] highlight of the film, made using a [...] model of Titanic, {{it would not have been}} physically possible. At the time of the book's writing, it was still believed that she sank in one piece.|$|E

2500|$|Additional risks {{posed by}} {{increased}} availability of inorganic nitrogen in aquatic ecosystems include water acidification; eutrophication of fresh and saltwater systems; and toxicity issues for animals, including humans. Eutrophication {{often leads to}} lower dissolved oxygen levels in the water column, including hypoxic and anoxic conditions, which can cause death of aquatic fauna. Relatively sessile <b>benthos,</b> or bottom-dwelling creatures, are particularly vulnerable because of their lack of mobility, though large fish kills are not uncommon. Oceanic dead zones {{near the mouth of}} the Mississippi in the Gulf of Mexico are a well-known example of algal bloom-induced hypoxia.|$|E
2500|$|Sturgeon are {{primarily}} benthic feeders, with {{a diet of}} shells, crustaceans and small fish. Exceptionally, both Huso species, the white sturgeon, and the pallid sturgeon feed primarily on other fish as adults. They feed by extending their syphon-like mouths to suck food from the <b>benthos.</b> Having no teeth, {{they are unable to}} seize prey, though larger individuals and more predatory species can swallow very large prey items, including whole salmon. [...] Sturgeons feed non-visually. They are believed to use a combination of sensors, including olfactory, tactile and chemosensory cues detected by the four barbels, and electroreception using their ampullae of Lorenzini.|$|E
2500|$|Algae, {{including}} both phytoplankton and periphyton are the principle photosynthesizers in ponds and lakes. [...] Phytoplankton are found drifting {{in the water}} column of the pelagic zone. [...] Many species have a higher density than water which should make them sink and end up in the <b>benthos.</b> [...] To combat this, phytoplankton have developed density changing mechanisms, by forming vacuoles and gas vesicles or by changing their shapes to induce drag, slowing their descent. [...] A very sophisticated adaptation utilized by a small number of species is a tail-like flagellum that can adjust vertical position and allow movement in any direction. Phytoplankton can also maintain their presence {{in the water column}} by being circulated in Langmuir rotations. [...] Periphytic algae, on the other hand, are attached to a substrate. [...] In lakes and ponds, they can cover all benthic surfaces. [...] Both types of plankton are important as food sources and as oxygen providers.|$|E
2500|$|Investigating {{the impacts}} of {{anthropogenic}} activities and climate change in the deep sea is a theme that runs through all HERMIONE research. [...] To the biological communities on open slopes and in deep basins, seafloor warming through climate change is a major threat. [...] Up to 85% of methane reservoirs along the continental margin could be destabilised, which would not only release climate-warming methane gas into the atmosphere, but would also have unknown and potentially devastating consequences on benthic communities. [...] The role of climatic variation on deep-sea <b>benthos</b> is not well understood, although large-scale changes {{in the structure of}} seafloor communities have been observed over the last two decades. [...] The use of long-term, deep-sea observatories, e.g., the Hausgarten deep-sea observatory in the Arctic and the time-series analysis of the Catalan margin and Southern Adriatic Sea, will help HERMIONE scientists to examine recent changes in benthic communities, and to study decadal variability in physical processes, such as the dense shelf water cascading events in submarine canyons.|$|E
