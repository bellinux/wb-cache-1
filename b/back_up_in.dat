5|$|Giro {{champion}} Denis Menchov was {{the last}} man to take the course. The rain started again as he and Di Luca were the last ones on course. He was on pace to win the stage, but he dramatically crashed in the final kilometer, with his bike skidding well {{out in front of}} him on the wet cobbles. Support staff from his team car gave him a very quick bike change and he was <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> moments, finishing 24 seconds back on the stage to preserve his overall victory in the Giro.|$|E

Once there, Peter finds the adult Olivia waiting for him, but realizes by her eyes {{that this is not}} her. A younger Olivia reveals herself as Olivia's true ego; assured of Peter's identity, she willingly goes with him and Bell. However, they are attacked by the image of her step-father and several military personnel. Peter sacrifices himself to protect her, waking <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the real world. Olivia is able to stand up against her past fears and stops their advance. William explains that she will be able to return to possession of her body as Walter, in the real world, attempts to extract William's mind.|$|E

25|$|A {{return to}} Serie B {{occurred}} in 1991, but {{lasted only a}} year. Palermo won the Serie C1 championship in 1993: that season, the league featured numerous other Sicilian clubs including Messina, Catania, Giarre, Siracusa and Acireale, with the latter promoted to Serie B together with Palermo. The rosanero stayed <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Serie B for four season, and in 1994 wrote a piece of history for themselves with a 1-0 away win against AC Milan in the Coppa Italia second round.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} week at Bristol, while running 5th, leader Denny Hamlin was wrecked by Kevin Harvick while racing for the lead, which then sent Hamlin's {{car into the}} inside wall. Hamlin's car then slid right <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> front of the No. 88 and slammed into the left-side door of the car, and the contact was bad enough to send Earnhardt behind the wall, and suffer a 39th-place finish. This was his second DNF of the year, after the early exit in the spring Texas race.|$|E

The track was rapidly losing money, so the board closed after operating 13 days. It opened <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> 1954 to host quarter horse racing but closed after seven weeks.|$|E
25|$|Rahman {{came back}} with three wins, {{including}} one in May 2000 over Corrie Sanders in a war {{in which he was}} dropped twice and came back to win in 7, and after that he was moved <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the rankings. After this fight, Sanders briefly retired. Finally, on April 22, 2001, Rahman earned a shot at Lennox Lewis the WBC, IBO and IBF heavyweight champion with a win over Frankie Swindell. Rahman beat Swindell via 7th-round RTD. Swindell quit on his stool after the 7th round, informing the ringside doctor that he had suffered an eye injury.|$|E
25|$|Cleverly {{made his}} fifth defence {{of the title}} against undefeated Russian Sergey Kovalev (21-0-1, 19 KOs) on 17 August 2013 at the Motorpoint Arena in Cardiff. On 9 July 2013, the {{official}} press conference took place to announce the fight. Cleverly, as champion, was given the underdog status by bookmakers. Cleverly said he had trained hard and was expecting the fight to be toughest of his career so far. Kovalev, who knocked out most of his opponents within three rounds, came out throwing heavy shots in the first round, hurt Cleverly badly in the third round, dropping him twice and nearly finishing him off. Kovalev picked things right <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the fourth, throwing bombs to send Cleverly down {{for a third time}} and the referee waved things off 29 seconds into the round. Cleverly considered retiring after the bout, but decided not to. In October 2013, Cleverly told the Daily Mirror that he wanted to rematch Kovalev.|$|E

25|$|At sea, Full-Eyes spots two {{warships}} tailing them. Thorfinn, {{along with}} the unwanted assistance of Hild, separates from the group, as {{he is the one}} Floki wants dead. They will meet <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Odense, Denmark. Some of Floki’s men follow them on land where they attack fishermen and burn boats to stop their means of escape. Thorfinn tries to rationalize with those men to take him to Floki but all they want is his head. With no other choice, Thorfinn fights them barehanded and backup from Hild. With only three pursuers remaining, one of them kills their leader. It turns out that the other two are part of the Vagn Battalion who infiltrated Floki’s army to track their movements. The two men, Eskil and Vrage, ask Thorfinn for assistance to vanquish Floki once and for all. They were testing him during his fight against the pursuers to observe his strength and noble birth as the candidate for leader of the Jomsvikings. Even if Thorfinn tries to live his life as a traveling merchant, he still cannot escape his bloody past.|$|E
25|$|Ross {{was known}} as a smart fighter with great stamina. He {{retained}} his title by decision against Sammy Fuller to finish 1933 and against Peter Nebo to begin 1934. Then he defended against former world champion Frankie Klick, against whom he drew in ten. Then came the first of three bouts versus Jimmy McLarnin. Ross vacated the light welterweight title to go after McLarnin's welterweight title and won by a 15-round decision, his third world championship. However, in a rematch a few weeks later, McLarnin beat Ross by a decision and recovered the title. After that, Ross went back down to light welterweight and reclaimed his title with a 12-round decision over Bobby Pacho. After beating Klick and Henry Woods by decision to retain that title, he went <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> weight for his third and last fight with McLarnin; he recovered the welterweight title by outpointing McLarnin again over 15 rounds. He won 16 bouts in a row after that, including three over future world middleweight champion Ceferino Garcia and one against Al Manfredo. His only two defenses, however, over that stretch were against Garcia and against Izzy Jannazzo, on points in 15 rounds.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the notable}} monuments of the Belle Époque were {{constructed}} for {{use at the}} Universal Expositions, for example the Eiffel Tower, the Grand Palais, the Petit Palais, and the Pont Alexandre III. The chief architectural legacy of the Third Republic was {{a large number of}} new schools and local city halls, all inscribed with the slogans of the republic and statues of allegorical symbols of the republic; representations of scientists, writers and political figures were placed in parks and squares. The largest monument was an allegorical statue of the republic erected {{in the center of the}} Place du Château-d'Eau, renamed the Place de la République in 1879. It was an enormous bronze figure 9.5 meters high of the republic holding an olive branch and standing on a pedestal 15 meters high. On 14 July 1880, the Place du Trône was renamed the Place de la Nation, and a group of statues by Jules Dalou, called Triumph of the Republic, was placed in the center. In the middle was Marianne in a chariot drawn by two lions surrounded by allegorical figures of Liberty, Work, Justice and Abundance. A plaster version was put in place in 1889, the bronze version in 1899. A 29-meter tall monument with a statue of another republican hero, Leon Gambetta, surmounted by a pylon crowned by an eagle, was placed in the Cour Napoléon of the Louvre in 1888. It was taken down in 1954 to clear the view of the Louvre, but was put <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> 1982, without the pylon and eagle, on the Square Édouard-Vaillant (20th arrondissement) by the socialist president François Mitterrand.|$|E

500|$|The party scenes at Jesse's house {{sought to}} {{illustrate}} Jesse's internal guilt and self-hatred for having murdered Gale Boetticher {{in the third}} season finale, [...] "Full Measure". Gilligan said these scenes were written {{because he wanted to}} demonstrate that the actions of the characters in Breaking Bad have major consequences. The writing staff spent weeks discussing how Jesse would react to having killed Gale, and went with the course of events in [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub" [...] in part because they felt it would be the most unexpected for the audience. Bryan Cranston praised these scenes, saying [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} way to show a person going through a private hell. That everybody suffers, deals with their own personal loss in many different ways." [...] The scenes were shot on a set in a sound stage built by production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin. Although scenes in Jesse's house are occasionally filmed in an actual house, these particular scenes could not be shot there because the party was so messy. Breaking Bad music supervisor Thomas Golubic tried to select music appropriate for both the party and Jesse's state of mind, using variations of punk rock, hip hop and dubstep. During one scene when Jesse, Skinny Pete and Badger are snorting meth together, Badger leans down outside of the shot to take the drugs, then Skinny Pete pops <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a match cut. The shot was conceived by MacLaren during filming.|$|E
