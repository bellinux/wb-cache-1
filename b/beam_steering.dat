The prototype MAR-II was built on reclaimed land {{just west of the}} original Zeus site. MAR-II was built into a pyramid with its back half removed. Like MAR-I, to save money MAR-II would be equipped with only one set of transmitter and receiver elements, but with all the wiring in place in case it had to be upgraded in the future. Nike-X was canceled before MAR-II was complete, and the semi-completed building was instead used as a climate-controlled storage facility.|$|E

2500|$|Expanding {{the beam}} emitted from the laser {{to fill the}} {{aperture}} of the objective {{will result in a}} tighter, diffraction-limited spot. While lateral translation of the trap relative to the sample can be accomplished by translation of the microscope slide, most tweezer setups have additional optics designed to translate the beam to give an extra degree of translational freedom. This can be done by translating the first of the two lenses labelled as [...] "Beam Steering" [...] in the figure. For example, translation of that lens in the lateral plane will result in a laterally deflected beam from what is drawn in the figure. If the distance between the <b>beam</b> <b>steering</b> lenses and the objective is chosen properly, this will correspond to a similar deflection before entering the objective and a resulting lateral translation in the sample plane. The position of the beam waist, that is the focus of the optical trap, can be adjusted by an axial displacement of the initial lens. Such an axial displacement causes the beam to diverge or converge slightly, the end result of which is an axially displaced position of the beam waist in the sample chamber.|$|E

Wind speed is a useful weather parameter to monitor and record for many applications like shipping, aviation, meteorology, construction etc. Wind observations are crucial importance for general (operational) aviation meteorology, and numerical weather prediction.

40|$|Abstract. A {{numerical}} simulation model {{based on the}} finite element method (FEM) and wave analysis is proposed to study the acoustic field of a linear instructions and ultrasonic phased array (LUPA) transducer. The ultrasonic wave propagation in the isotropic solid is studied. The delay law controlling for electronic scanning of a LUPA transducer is analyzed. The ultrasonic wave propagation in the inspection material can be visualized {{in the form of}} displacement cloud images by FEM modeling. Experiments show that the model can efficiently and accurately predict the radiation field of <b>beam</b> focusing, <b>steering</b> and electronic scanning of a linear phased array transducer. By employing the proposed method, parameters can be conveniently changed to study the acoustic field of the ultrasonic beam in the medium. It is very helpful for designing and applying the linear phased array transducer and flaw inspection in NDT field. ...|$|R
