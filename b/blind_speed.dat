What is the least expected time required for m≤ n of them to meet together at a single point?

40|$|Ground {{moving target}} {{indication}} (GMTI) for syn- thetic aperture radar (SAR) {{provides information on}} nonstatic objects in radar imagery of a static ground scene. An efficient approach for GMTI {{is the use of}} multichannel SAR systems for a space- and time-variant analysis of moving targets. This allows the indication, correction of position displacement, and estimation of radial velocity components of moving targets in a SAR image. All three steps are possible due to a determinable Doppler frequency shift in the radar signal caused by radial target movement. This paper focuses on the millimeter wave (mmW) SAR system MEMPHIS with multichannel amplitude-comparison monopulse data acquisition and the ability to use carrier frequencies of 35 and 94 GHz simultaneously, making it a dual-frequency SAR. This paper includes mmW-specific SAR GMTI considerations, an adaptive algorithm to collect velocity and position information on moving targets with mmW monopulse radar, and a discussion on GMTI <b>blind</b> <b>speed</b> elimination and target velocity ambiguity resolving by dual-frequency SAR.

40|$|The {{generalized}} Radon-Fourier transform (GRFT) {{has been}} proposed to detect radar weak maneuvering targets by realizing coherent integration via jointly searching in motion parameter space. Two main drawbacks of GRFT are the heavy computational burden and the <b>blind</b> <b>speed</b> side lobes (BSSL) which will cause serious false alarms. The BSSL learning-based particle swarm optimization (BPSO) {{has been proposed}} before to reduce the computational burden of GRFT and solve the BSSL problem simultaneously. However, the BPSO suffers from an apparent loss in detection performance compared with GRFT. In this paper, a fast implementation algorithm of GRFT using the BSSL learning-based modified wind-driven optimization (BMWDO) is proposed. In the BMWDO, the BSSL learning procedure {{is also used to}} deal with the BSSL phenomenon. Besides, the MWDO adjusts the coefficients in WDO with Levy distribution and uniform distribution, and it outperforms PSO in a noisy environment. Compared with BPSO, the proposed method can achieve better detection performance with a similar computational cost. Several numerical experiments are also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Ground {{moving target}} {{indication}} (GMTI) for syn-thetic aperture radar (SAR) {{provides information on}} nonstatic objects in radar imagery of a static ground scene. An efficient approach for GMTI {{is the use of}} multichannel SAR systems for a space- and time-variant analysis of moving targets. This allows the indication, correction of position displacement, and estimation of radial velocity components of moving targets in a SAR image. All three steps are possible due to a determinable Doppler fre-quency shift in the radar signal caused by radial target movement.

40|$|We apply a {{new method}} of {{analysis}} to the asymmetric rendezvous search problem on the line (ARSPL). This problem, previously studied in a paper of Alpern and Gal (1995), asks how two <b>blind,</b> <b>speed</b> one players placed a distance d apart on the line, can find each other in minimum expected time. The distance d is drawn from a known cumulative probability distribution G, and the players are faced in random directions. We show that the ARSPL is strategically equivalent to a new problem we call the double linear search problem (DLSP), where an object is placed equiprobably on one of two lines, and equiprobably at positions ±d. A searcher is placed at the origin {{of each of these}} lines. The two searchers move with a combined speed of one, to minimize the expected time before one of them finds the object. Using results from a concurrent paper of the first author and J. V. Howard (1998), we solve the DLSP (and hence the ARSPL) for the case where G is convex on its support, and show that the solution is that conjectured in a paper of Baston and Gal (1998) ...|$|E
