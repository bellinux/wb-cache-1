The hot wet air leaves {{the top of the}} hopper and is first run through an after-cooler, because it is easier to remove moisture from cold air than hot air. The resulting cool wet air is then passed through a desiccant bed. Finally, the cool dry air leaving the desiccant bed is re-heated in a process heater and sent back through the same processes in a closed loop. Typically, residual moisture levels in the resin must be less than 50 parts per million (parts of water per million parts of resin, by weight) before processing. Dryer residence time should not be shorter than about four hours. This is because drying the material in less than 4 hours would require a temperature above 160Â°C, at which level hydrolysis would begin inside the pellets before they could be dried out.|$|E

50|$|Agitated Feed hoppers {{improve on}} the Gravity {{method of feeding}} the marker.

50|$|Typical lamella {{clarifier}} design {{consists of a}} series of inclined plates inside a vessel, see first figure.

A hopper dredge usually has doors in its bottom to empty the dredged materials, but some dredges empty their hoppers by splitting the two halves of their hulls on giant hydraulic hinges. Either way, as the vessel dredges, excess water in the dredged materials is spilled off as the heavier solids settle to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hopper.</b> This excess water is returned to the sea to reduce weight and increase the amount of solid material (or slurry) that can be carried in one load. When the hopper is filled with slurry, the dredger stops dredging and goes to a dump site and empties its hopper.|$|E

50|$|A handle, {{located on}} the first floor, {{controls}} a trap door on the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hopper,</b> which allows the fruit to fall thru {{to the first floor}} chute. On their way down the chute, the apples are chopped into small pieces, about four bushels at a time, and are then placed in a special nylon blanket. This process continues until up to 12 blankets are stacked on top of one another.The layers of chopped apples are on a large turntable that rotates under the apple press. The press used at Yates Cider Mill is called a âscrew pressâ because large screws turn to make the press go down, putting 50 tons of pressure on the blankets of chopped apples for 15 minutes. As the press goes down on the blankets, the cider comes thru the weave in the cloth leaving the seeds, peelings and pulp inside the blanket. All by-products are then discarded down a chute in the floor and into a small railroad car under the mill. Periodically, the car is transferred to the dump area. The cider then flows from the press to chilled mixing tanks. From there, the cider is filtered to remove any and all small apple particles. Flash pasteurization is the last step before bottling. The cider is heated to 160 degrees Fahrenheit for six seconds and then immediately cooled back down to 35 degrees and bottled. In one autumn weekend, the mill juices over half a million apples and can produce 300 gallons of cider an hour.|$|E

40|$|Amongst {{the design}} {{parameters}} for a beach nourishment project, sand size must be highlighted. Sand size is critical {{not only to}} compare the suitability of a borrow sand to substitute the eroded native sand, but also to identify the new equilibrium beach profile and to calculate the sediment volume necessary to achieve the projected berm or beach width. Some researchers have already taken into account the phenomena that change the theoretical volume of sand needed for a beach nourishment project (CUR, 1987; CEM 2002) such as the methodology for the hopper measurements taken on board of the dredger (MuÃ±oz-Perez et al., 2003) or the sand porosity variability (Roman-Sierra et al., 2014). Nevertheless, no investigation {{has been carried out}} about the variability of sand size inside the hopper of a trailing suction dredger till nowadays. There are several reasons to justify this possible heterogeneity of the granulometric parameters inside the hopper. Firstly, there is the intrinsic variability of the sediment characteristics at the sea bottom. On top of that, most of the vessels which dredge nowadays are of the Trailing Suction Hopper Dredgers (TSHD) type and this means that these vessels do not dredge in a stationary way, i. e. at a certain location and vicinity, but along a big stretch of the bottom. Moreover, the fall speed of sand depends directly on the grain diameter (for a given density); i. e. the larger the grain sizes the faster the grain deposits and so, probably, the coarser grains would be at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hopper</b> and the finer grains would be at the top. Finally, it is noteworthy a word about the fragments of shells or bioclasts: because of their flat shape, these pieces linger more than the silica grains to decant and, therefore, their percentage will most likely be larger at the surface of the hopper...|$|E
40|$|Swedish {{agricultural}} soils {{are reported to}} receive an annual application of plant nutrients as fertilizer amounting to a value almost as large the total new-investment made during one year. Poor precision in nutrient supply results in yield decreases and environmental loading. The purpose of this work is to summarize the knowledge available today on factors that influence fertilizer distribution achieved by pneumatic fertilizer spreaders. The work is mainly concentrated on technical design parameters that influences the spreading uniformity parallel to and {{at right angles to}} the direction of travel. The average coefficient of variation for the evenness of spreading of todayâs fertilizer spreaders is 25 % in the field. In practise, there is no significant difference between centrifugal spreaders and pneumatic spreaders. During the work of which this report accounts for, 87 Swedish and international references have been studied in order to find factors influencing the result of fertilizer spreading. Factors influencing the spreading result can be divided into: the fertilizer, the machine, the field the weather and the operator. The flow properties of the fertilizer and its tendency to deposit on working mechanism are affected by its physical properties. The particle size distribution influences length of throw, flow properties and tendency of separation. The durability of the fertilizer will affect the particle size distribution. Particle shape and surface texture affect the flow properties. Density influences throw properties. Hygroscopicity influences water uptake and thereby flow properties and tendency to deposit within the machine. Thixotropic fertilizers lead to hard deposits being placed on working mechanisms and transport ducts against which the fertilizer glides. The machine can be divided into fertilizer hopper, feeder mechanism, fan, piping, spreader boom and spreader mechanism. When filling a hopper separation generally occurs. Severe separation influences the resulting distribution. When emptying the hopper the slope of the floor will influence the amount of fertilizer remaining in the hopper. 60 â 65 Â° slope of the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hopper</b> will ensure complete emptying. Metering mechanisms can be divided into active and passive mechanisms. The function of passive mechanisms depend on the flow properties of the fertilizer. The studded roller is a semi-active metering mechanism. Cyclic variations in out-flow may occur in metering devices that measure out the fertilizer in portions, e. g. cell wheels, star wheels and augers. Shaking and slope of hopper influences the mass flow from passive metering mechanisms. The fan is used to transport the fertilizer within the machine. The flow of air can be used to reduce drift caused by wind if both the flow of fertilizer and the flow of air are directed downwards at the spreading mechanism. At high fertilizer application rates the fan-pipe system in modern fertilizer spreaders tend to overload, with pulsating flows as a result. These pulsating flows are reflected in a severe deterioration of the spreading uniformity. The piping functions as a way of transport of the fertilizer. Piping with a high coefficient of friction leads to a rapidly attained even radial distribution of granules in the pipe. Curves induces pressure losses and deteriorated radial distribution in the pipe. Bends immediately before the spreading mechanism should be avoided. Movements of the spreader boom influences the final result of fertilizer spreading. Boom movements occur {{largely as a result of}} the torque of the fertilizer vehicle along its respective longitudinal and vertical axles. The response of a boom suspension to the rolling motion of the vehicle to which it is attached should be such that the boom is insulated from the high frequency random rolling movements but is able to follow the low frequency undulations of the ground. An example of such a boom suspension is found in the literature. In the literature, spreader mechanisms are found in many different shapes. Significant for the majority of them is that their evenness of distribution is sensitive to the radial distribution of granules in the pipe immediately before entering the spreader mechanism. The evenness of distribution is also sensitive to the working height above the ground. The field will through its geometry (shape, slope and bumpiness) affect the working result in form of unevennesses in the spreading pattern, gaps and overlapping. Soil type variations and varying cultivation capacity demand variable application rates. The weather factors that mainly influence the spreading accuracy are wind speed, air temperature and relative humidity. The wind speed influences the length and direction of throw. Air temperature and moisture are together with the temperature of the fertilizer decisive for the water uptake of the fertilizer. Large water uptake will change the flow properties of the fertilizer in a negative direction. The operator is the overall regulator in the "granule spreading system". The operator adjusts and maintain the machine. It is the operator who choses driving technique and the way the work is done. A technically very good fertilizer spreader cannot compensate fully for a bad operator. The operator should have assistance in steering the tractor and information of and possibility to adjust the application rate. What requirements can be placed on the future fertilizer spreader? The requirements placed on the fertilizer spreader of the future involve large control ability, i. e. high spreading accuracy and possibility to continuously vary the application rate. Furthermore, some kind of control over the mass flow of fertilizer will be needed. This review of the literature is concluded with a presentation of a new type of fertilizer spreader. The concept gives precedence to low manufacturing cost, active metering mechanism, variable mass flow and even distribution of fertilizer to the spreader mechanisms...|$|E
