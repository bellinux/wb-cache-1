5|$|According to a U.S. official, in 2004 a {{prisoner}} named Hassan Ghul revealed that <b>bin</b> Laden {{relied on a}} trusted courier known as al-Kuwaiti. Ghul stated that al-Kuwaiti was close to <b>bin</b> Laden as well as Khalid Sheik Mohammed and Mohammed's successor Abu Faraj al-Libbi. Ghul revealed that al-Kuwaiti had not been seen in some time, which led U.S. officials to suspect he was traveling with <b>bin</b> Laden. When confronted with Ghul's account, Mohammed maintained his original story. Abu Faraj al-Libbi was captured in 2005 and transferred to Guantánamo in September 2006. He told CIA interrogators that <b>bin</b> Laden's courier was a man named Maulawi Abd al-Khaliq Jan and denied knowing al-Kuwaiti. Because both Mohammed and al-Libbi had minimized al-Kuwaiti's importance, officials speculated that {{he was part of}} <b>bin</b> Laden's inner circle.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of <b>bin</b> Laden, some {{officials}} from the Bush administration, such as former Bush Office of Legal Counsel attorney John Yoo and former attorney general Michael Mukasey, wrote op-eds stating that the enhanced interrogation techniques they authorized (since legally clarified as torture) yielded the intelligence that later led to locating <b>bin</b> Laden's hideout. Mukasey said that the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed caused him to reveal the nickname of <b>bin</b> Laden's courier.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the U.S. was {{planning}} its own actions against <b>bin</b> Laden. Michael Scheuer, {{chief of the}} CIA's <b>bin</b> Laden unit (Alec Station), considered using local Afghans to kidnap <b>bin</b> Laden, then exfiltrate him from Afghanistan in a modified Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Documents recovered from Wadih el-Hage's Nairobi computer suggested a link between <b>bin</b> Laden and the deaths of U.S. troops in Somalia. These were used {{as the foundation for}} the June 1998 New York indictment of <b>bin</b> Laden, although the charges were later dropped. The planned raid was cancelled in May after internecine disputes between officials at the FBI and the CIA; the hesitation of the National Security Council (NSC) to approve the plan; concerns over the raid's chance of success, and the potential for civilian casualties.|$|E
40|$|An {{intention}} of MapReduce Sets for <b>Binning</b> expressions analysis has to suggest criteria how <b>Binning</b> expressions in <b>Binning</b> {{data can be}} defined {{in a meaningful way}} and how they should be compared. Similitude based MapReduce Sets for <b>Binning</b> Expression Analysis and MapReduce Sets for Assignment is expected to adhere to fundamental principles of the scientific <b>Binning</b> process that are expressiveness of <b>Binning</b> models and reproducibility of their <b>Binning</b> inference. <b>Binning</b> expressions are assumed to be elements of a <b>Binning</b> expression space or Conjecture class and <b>Binning</b> data provide “information ” which of these <b>Binning</b> expressions should be used to interpret the <b>Binning</b> data. An inference <b>Binning</b> algorithm constructs the mapping between <b>Binning</b> data and <b>Binning</b> expressions, in particular by a <b>Binning</b> cost minimization process. Fluctuations in the <b>Binning</b> data often limit the <b>Binning</b> precision, which we can achieve to uniquely identify a single <b>Binning</b> expression as interpretation of the <b>Binning</b> data. We advocate an information theoretic perspective on <b>Binning</b> expression analysis to resolve this dilemma where the tradeoff between <b>Binning</b> informativeness of statistical inference <b>Binning</b> and their <b>Binning</b> stability is mirrored in the information-theoretic <b>Binning</b> optimum of high <b>Binning</b> information rate and zero communication expression error. The inference <b>Binning</b> algorithm is considered as an outlier object <b>Binning</b> path, which naturally limits the resolution of the <b>Binning</b> expression space given the uncertainty of the <b>Binning</b> data...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the role of}} Wyner-Ziv <b>binning</b> in compress-forward for relay channels. In the one-way relay channel, we analyze a compress-forward scheme without Wyner- Ziv <b>binning</b> but with joint decoding of both the message and compression index. It achieves {{the same rate as}} the original compress-forward scheme with <b>binning</b> and successive decoding. Therefore, <b>binning</b> helps reduce decoding complexity by allowing successive decoding, but has no impact on achievable rate for the one-way relay channel. On the other hand, no <b>binning</b> simplifies relay operation. By extending compress-forward without <b>binning</b> to the two-way relay channel, we can achieve a larger rate region than the original compress-forward scheme when the channel is asymmetric for the two users. <b>Binning</b> and successive decoding limits the compression rate to match the weaker of the channels from relay to two users, whereas without <b>binning,</b> this restriction no longer applies. Compared with noisy network coding, compress-forward without <b>binning</b> achieves the same rate region in certain Gaussian channel configurations, and it has much less delay. This work is a step toward understanding the role of Wyner-Ziv <b>binning</b> in compress-forward relaying. Comment: Appeared at Allerton conference Sept 201...|$|R

40|$|AbstractNumber of cores per {{multi-core}} processor die, {{as well as}} variation {{between the}} maximum operating frequency of individual cores, is rapidly increasing.

40|$|We {{show that}} using either {{the method of}} Page & Carrera or the {{well-known}} $ 1 /V_a$ method to construct the <b>binned</b> luminosity function (LF) of a flux limited sample of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) can produce an artificial flattening (or steepening {{in the case of}} negative evolution) of the <b>binned</b> LF for <b>bins</b> intersected by the flux cutoff of the sample. This effect is more pronounced for samples with steep and strongly evolving parent LFs but is still present even for non-evolving LFs. As a result of this distortion of the true LF, fitting a model LF to <b>binned</b> data may lead to errors in the estimation of the parameters and may even prompt the erroneous use of broken power law functions. We compute the expected positions of apparent breaks in the <b>binned</b> LF. We show that these spurious breaks in the <b>binned</b> LFs can be avoided if the <b>binning</b> is done in the flux [...] redshift plane instead of the typically used luminosity [...] redshift plane. <b>Binning</b> in the flux [...] redshift plane can be used in conjunction with the <b>binning</b> in the luminosity [...] redshift plane to test for real breaks in the <b>binned</b> LFs and to identify the features that are the result of <b>binning</b> biases.
