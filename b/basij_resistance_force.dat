The Basij could be committed to assist in the defense of the country against internal or external threats, but by 2008 had also been deployed in mobilizing voters in elections and alleged tampering during such activities. Another element was the Quds Force, a special forces element tasked with unconventional warfare roles and known to be involved providing assistance and training to various militant organizations around the world.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{capacity}} of the robotic device REAplan to measure overall 			upper limb peak <b>resistance</b> <b>force,</b> as a reflection of upper limb 			spasticity. 			Methods: Twelve patients with chronic stroke presenting upper limb spasticity were 			recruited to the study. Patients underwent musculocutaneous motor 			nerve block to reduce the spasticity of elbow flexor muscles. Each 			patient was assessed before and after the motor nerve block. Overall 			the REAplan measured upper limb <b>resistance</b> <b>force.</b> The robot passively 			mobilized the patient’s upper limb at various velocities (10, 20, 30, 			 40 and 50 cm/s) in a back-and-forth trajectory (30 cm). The peak 			<b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> was analysed for each forward movement. Ten 			movements were performed and averaged at each velocity condition. 			Results: The overall upper limb <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> increased 			proportionally to the mobilization velocity (p 0. 6). 			Conclusion: This study proposes a new, valid, reliable and sensitive protocol to 			quantify upper limb <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> using the REAplan, as a 			reflection of upper limb spasticity...|$|R
40|$|The <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> of the {{granular}} matter is modeled as a linear superposition of a static (quadratic depth-dependent) <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> and a dynamic (quadratic velocity-dependent) frictional force. The impact is defined {{from the moment}} the end point of the system comes in contact with the {{granular matter}} surface until the vertical linear velocity of the end point is zero. The variables of interest are the final depth {{at the end of the}} penetration phase and the stopping time. The results for a two-link kinematic chain with two points of contact were compared to the results obtained by applying the <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> formulation developed to corresponding CAD simulation models. The results revealed that the final displacement increases with initial velocity, while the stopping time decreases. The sensitivity to the initial velocity was studied and an improvement to the <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> formulated as a result. A series of expressions are proposed for the <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> coefficients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract>> In this study, {{solutions}} for a liquid pool spreading model with continuous and instantaneous release are discussed {{based on the}} model used in the FERC's report. The effects of the release time on the liquid pool volume and radius are investigated for the continuous release. For the continuous release with the frictional <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> in the liquid pool spreading model, the vaporization time decreases as the release time increases. On the other hand, for the continuous release without the frictional <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> in the liquid pool spreading model, the vaporization time increases as the release time increases. These phenomena are deeply related to the pool radius. In addition, {{the effects of the}} initial pool radius for the instantaneous release in the liquid pool spreading model are discussed. For the case with the frictional <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> in the liquid pool spreading model, as reducing release time in the model with the frictional <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> for the continuous release, the solution for a continuous release approaches to that for an instantaneous release. On the contrary to this, the pool volume and radius for the instantaneous release without the frictional <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> are totally different from those for the continuous release without the frictional <b>resistance</b> <b>force...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn Japan {{where large}} {{earthquakes}} frequently occur, {{it is important}} to increase the resistibility of railway structures to earthquakes. The authors performed a shaking table test using a full-scale model to evaluate the lateral <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> of the ballasted track during earthquakes. In this study, the shaking table test was attempted under test conditions under which the sleeper is given the lateral force to induce track buckling. Two kinds of cross sections of ballasted track for the full-scale model were applied: a straight track and a curved track to evaluate the influence of the difference of the cross section of ballasted track on the lateral <b>resistance</b> <b>force.</b> The results of the shaking table test clarified that the lateral <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> of the ballasted track decreased during shaking, and the lateral sleeper displacement increased significantly by lateral force smaller than the lateral <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> of the ballasted track after shaking. In addition, it is considered that the influence of the cross section of ballasted track on the lateral ballast <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> during shaking and after shaking is small...|$|R
40|$|The {{interactions}} between an eco-spiral bolt and crushed rocks in a borehole {{were evaluated by}} pull-out testing in a laboratory and numerical analysis. The porosity of the crushed rock surrounding the bolt depended {{on the size of}} the eco-spiral bolt and affected the eco-spiral bolt’s axial <b>resistance</b> <b>force.</b> The axial <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> and the porosity of the crushed rocks in the borehole showed an inverse relationship. The porosity was also related to the size of the eco-spiral bolt. The maximum principal stress between the bolt and the rock was related to the porosity of the crushed rock and the size difference between the eco-spiral bolt and the borehole. At low porosity the experimental and numerical analyses show similar relationships between the axial <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> and the displacement. However, at high porosity, the numerical results deviated greatly from the experimental observation. The initial agreement is attributed to the state of residual resistance after the maximum axial <b>resistance</b> <b>force,</b> and the latter divergence was due to the decreasing axial <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> owing to slippage...|$|R

40|$|Tyres are a {{final output}} torque {{of the vehicle}} before all the forces are {{distributed}} to the road surface as a tractive force. When the tyre pressure changed, it had a direct effect on rolling <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> of the vehicle and reduced the tractive force. Moreover, it {{had an effect on}} a rate of fuel consumption and driving comfort. This research had tested the effect of tyre pressure of 25 psi and 45 psi to determine the total <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> between the vehicle speed from 40 km/hr to 100 km/hr and compare with the reference tyre pressure of 35 psi by using the “coast-down technique”. The results from calculation showed the total <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> when the vehicle speed was zero from tyre pressure of 25 psi increased by 48. 52 % from reference value and the total <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> from tyre pressure of 45 psi decreased by 13. 46 % from the reference tyre pressure. The different <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> from tyre pressure of 35 psi with the other 2 values of tyre pressure in the research were called the different rolling <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> because the vehicle changed only tyre pressure which had no effect on aerodynamics drag. The relationship of the different rolling <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> along the test speed from tyre pressure of 25 psi and 45 psi decreased while the vehicle speed increased. The relationship can be fitted with a linear equation. The slope from tyre pressure of 25 psi was 0. 2358 which was steeper than the slope of 0. 0828 from 45 psi tyre pressure. These were the effect of tyre characteristic that made from rubber. When the vehicle speed was low, the frequency of tyre deformation was also low and resulted in high energy loss from hysteresis phenomena. Therefore high rolling <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> was generated. Considering the effect of tyre under high vehicle speed, the frequency of tyre deformation increased and made the molecule of rubber vibrate more than low vehicle speed. These effects made the tyre stiffer than low frequency and resulted in decreasing the rolling <b>resistance</b> <b>force.</b> In additional, high frequency that caused by high tyre pressure had effected on driving comfort in a real driving condition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide a simple method for {{estimating}} the driving resistance of rubber conveyer belts. The driving resistance of a rubber belt running on the carrier roller was estimated by a <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> acting on a roller moving on the rubber conveyer belt while the belt was fixed on an aluminum channel. Four types of conveyor belts were tested to confirm the present technique is useful for grading rubber conveyer belts from a viewpoint of energy dissipation on the carrier rollers of the conveyer system. The effects of normal force acting on the roller and driving speed of the roller on the <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> were investigated. Four belts were fabricated with different rubber types of rubber, respectively. It was confirmed from the experiments that the estimated <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> varied with respect to the rubber characteristics, which was consistent to the experience from the existing belt conveyer systems for energy consumption. The <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> of the carrier roller increases with an increase of roller speed. It also decreases when a lower damping rubber is used while the belt rigidity does not affect the <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> when low <b>resistance</b> rubber is used. The proposed method is applicable to estimate the total energy loss of rubber conveyer belts on the carrier rollers...|$|R

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{friction}} {{characteristics of the}} instrument-trocar interface in laparoscopic surgery for varying linear instrument velocities, trocar seal design and material, and trocar tilt. Furthermore, the effect of applying lubrication at the instrument-trocar seal interface on friction was studied. A friction testing apparatus was designed and built to characterise the <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> at the instrument-trocar interface {{as a function of}} the instrument's linear movement in the 12 -mm trocar (at constant velocity) for different design, seal material, and angle of tilt. The <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> depended on the trocar seal design and material properties, specifically surface roughness, elasticity, hardness, the direction of movement, and the instrument linear velocity, and varied between 0. 25 and 8 N. Lubricating the shaft with silicone oil reduced the peak <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> by 75 % for all trocars and eliminated the stick-slip phenomenon evident in non-lubricated cases. The magnitude of fluctuation in <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> depends on the trocar design and is attributed to stick-slip of the sealing mechanism and is generally higher during retraction in comparison to insertion. Trocars that have an inlet seal made of rubber/polyurethane showed higher <b>resistance</b> <b>forces</b> during retraction. Use of a lubricant significantly reduced frictional effects. Comparisons of the investigated trocars indicate that a low friction port, providing the surgeon with improved haptic feedback, can be designed by improving the tribological properties of the trocar seal interface...|$|R
