25|$|On September 17, 1948, Bernadotte came to Jerusalem in a {{car with}} General Åge Lundström on his way to meet Israeli {{official}} Dov Yosef, who was then the military governor of the Israeli-controlled portion of Jerusalem's New City. Bernadotte's car was stopped by an Israeli Army Jeep at a roadblock in the Katamon neighborhood. Cohen ran from the Jeep pointed a gun inside the car and shot at Bernadotte and the others {{in the back seat of}} the car at point-blank range, riddling him with bullets. Bernadotte had been hit six times, killing him almost instantaneously. The car was driven at full speed to Hadassah Hospital on Mount Scopus, but doctors there were unable to do anything for Bernadotte, who was bleeding profusely from his wounds. French Army Colonel André Serot, who had <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back seat next to Bernadotte, was also killed. The tires of the other vehicles in Bernadotte's convoy had been shot out, and the hit team fled to Shaarei Pina, where they were hidden by haredi supporters of Lehi, before moving on to Tel Aviv in a furniture truck.|$|E

2500|$|The {{body of the}} air hostess {{was found}} in the cockpit rather than near the hostess's seat {{at the rear of the}} {{passenger}} cabin. The Chief Pilot of Queensland Airlines suggested the pilot would have examined the waybill and would have been aware the aircraft was tail-heavy.

[...] The Chief Pilot told the inquest the loading chart indicated that if the air hostess had <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cockpit the aircraft's centre of gravity would have been within the approved limits.|$|E
2500|$|Ives {{was born}} in Danbury, Connecticut in 1874, the son of George Ives, a U.S. Army bandleader in the American Civil War, and his wife, Mary Parmelee. A strong {{influence}} of his may have <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Danbury town square, listening to George's marching band and other bands on other sides of the square simultaneously. George's unique music lessons were also a strong influence on him; George took an open-minded approach to musical theory, encouraging him to experiment in bitonal and polytonal harmonizations. It was from him that Ives also learned the music of Stephen Foster. He became a church organist {{at the age of}} 14 and wrote various hymns and songs for church services, including his Variations on [...] "America", which he wrote for a Fourth of July concert in Brewster, New York. It is considered challenging even by modern concert organists, but he famously spoke of it as being [...] "as much fun as playing baseball", a commentary on his own organ technique at that age.|$|E
