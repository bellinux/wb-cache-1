Based on the LTZ trim, the Activ adds new design elements like a larger front <b>bumper</b> with <b>skid</b> guards, 16-inch alloy wheels, roof rails, black plastic cladding for {{the lower part of}} the front and rear <b>bumpers</b> with silver <b>skid</b> plates, silver inserts for the side lower body and reflectors on the rear bumper, which sees ‘Activ’ embossed on it.

50|$|The {{fuselage}} was oval {{in section}} and plywood skinned. The single seat cockpit was {{just ahead of}} the wings and had a multi-part, detachable, transparent canopy with a rather abrupt forward profile and a brief fairing aft. The fuselage narrowed to the rear where the tapered tailplane was mounted just above the fuselage on a short sub-fin or pedestal. There was no fixed fin; the tapered, rounded, fabric covered rudder extended to the lower fuselage and moved in a cut-out in the elevators. A single main skid reached from the nose to below the trailing edge of the wing, with a <b>bumper</b> style tail <b>skid</b> on the extreme rear fuselage.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from having}} {{different}} cross-sections, the fuselages {{of the two}} models built differed only in cockpit and undercarriage details. The first {{seems to have been}} referred to as the Caproni Vizzola MF; the second was certainly the Caproni Vizzola 2. In both, the rear of the cockpit was under the wing leading edge with the pilot's head against the pedestal. On the MF the cockpit was open with just a small windscreen but the Caproni Vizzola 2 had a deeper and longer cockpit enclosed by a framed canopy and with three small transparencies in the nose. Behind the wing the pedestal fell away gently as the fuselage tapered to the tail. The first model had an hexagonal cross section fuselage but that of the Caparoni Vizzola 2 was smother externally and had a teardrop section. Both were plywood skinned. They shared the usual sprung skid undercarriage and tail <b>bumper,</b> though the <b>skid</b> on the later model was extended a little rearwards; both had a fixed monowheel below the wing.|$|R
