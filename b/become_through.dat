Beyond this I look to the forethought not yet so widely diffused in this country as in Scotland, & in some foreign lands; & I need not remind you that in order to facilitate its exercise the Government have been empowered by Legislation to <b>become</b> <b>through</b> the Dept. of the P.O. the receivers & guardians of savings.|$|E

[...] In the same chapter, however, Goldman affirmed that [...] "Revolution is indeed a violent process," [...] and noted that violence was the [...] "tragic inevitability of revolutionary upheavals..."

60|$|He {{accordingly}} {{addressed a}} carefully considered epistle to Sue, and, knowing her emotional temperament, threw a Rhadamanthine strictness into the lines here and there, carefully hiding his heterodox feelings, not to frighten her.

He would not conceal from her that passionate love {{had little to do}} with his communication.

60|$|And secondly, {{because it}} seems to me that the real {{philosophy}} of the facts is altogether missed in the narrative. The wrong which chanced to be set right in these two cases was done, as all such wrong is, mainly because these wicked courts of equity, with all their means of evasion and postponement, give scoundrels confidence in cheating. If justice were cheap, sure, and speedy, few such things could be. It is because it has <b>become</b> (<b>through</b> the vile dealing of those courts and the vermin they have called into existence) a positive precept of experience that a man had better endure a great wrong than go, or suffer himself to be taken, into Chancery, with the dream of setting it right. It is because of this that such nefarious speculations are made.|$|E

At first she frightened me; but presently I was aware that she was quite as safe here as was I. When we finally came to my ledge and I again held her in my arms, she recalled to my mind that for several weeks she had been living the life of a cave-girl with the tribe of hatchet-men.

60|$|He {{must have}} known that if danger of {{assassination}} threatened him from any quarter it was most to be feared from those whose influence with the Queen was almost such as {{to give them a}} control over her--the Concinis and their unavowed but obvious ally the Duke of Epernon. If he were dead, and the Queen so left that she could be made absolute regent during the Dauphin's minority, it was those adventurers who would <b>become</b> <b>through</b> her the true rulers of France, and so enrich themselves and gratify to the full their covetous ambitions. He saw clearly that his safety lay in opposing this coronation--already fixed for the 13th May--which Maria de' Medici was so insistent should take place before his departure for the wars.

60|$|In {{regard to}} size, M. Carbonnier[10] {{maintains}} that with almost all fishes the female {{is larger than}} the male; and Dr. Günther does not know of a single instance in which the male is actually larger than the female. With some Cyprinodonts the male is not even half as large as the female. As with many kinds of fishes the males habitually fight together; it is surprising that they have not generally <b>become</b> <b>through</b> the effects of sexual selection larger and stronger than the females. The males suffer from their small size, for according to M. Carbonnier they are liable to be devoured by the females of their own species when carnivorous, and no doubt by other species. Increased size must be in some manner of more importance to the females, than strength and size are to the males for fighting with other males; and this perhaps is to allow of the production of a vast number of ova.|$|E
