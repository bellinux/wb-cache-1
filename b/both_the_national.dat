5|$|Prior to 1953, {{the office}} of the National Herald (Riksheraldiker) was {{responsible}} for preparing municipal arms and the royal arms of Sweden, but today these duties are carried out by the Heraldry Board of the National Archives, including the State Herald (Statsheraldiker). In order to register new municipal arms, a municipality must submit its proposal to <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Archives Heraldry Board, which consults and renders an opinion, and to the PRV for registration. Once the board has completed its consultation process and provided a warrant of arms, the arms thus warranted may then be registered by the PRV and implemented by the municipality. Apart from municipal arms, heraldic arms registered by counties and by military and other government bodies are also handled by the National Archives Heraldry Board and the PRV.|$|E
5|$|The All-Star Game {{managers}} {{selected the}} entire lineups from 1933 to 1946. In 1947, the fans {{were given the}} ability to select the starting lineups.

This forced Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick {{to step in and}} replace Wally Post and Gus Bell with Willie Mays and Hank Aaron that season and to turn over the starting lineup selection to players, coaches and managers for several subsequent seasons. Since 1970, the fans have elected the starting lineup of one player for each baseball position (except the pitcher) for <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> League and American League teams.|$|E
