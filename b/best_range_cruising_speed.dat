40|$|Today many of {{the routes}} between small to medium sized {{airports}} and large hubs are operated by regional aircraft, powered by turboprop or turbofan engines. In the future the open rotor engine might provide an alternative option. The open rotor would combine the possibility of high <b>cruise</b> <b>speed</b> with high propulsive efficiency. Also, since the open rotor essentially is a turboprop with the possibility to fly fast, there is a benefit of high specific <b>range</b> at low <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds,</b> thus giving it a wide <b>range</b> <b>cruise</b> operation. In this paper a regional aircraft for 70 passengers and 3000 km range is studied. The aircraft is evaluated with both a counter rotating open rotor and a turbofan engine. Aircraft design parameters such as wing area and sweep are varied together with engine parameters such as engine power and propeller disc loading. Results show that the open rotor aircraft has a 17. 0 % higher specific range at the optimal cruise Mach number compared to the turbofan aircraft. For higher speeds, at Mach 0. 78, the difference is reduced to 15. 0 %.

40|$|The German Aerospace Center (DLR) is {{currently}} developing a multidisciplinary toolbox {{for the design}} of conventional and unconventional rotorcraft. The resulting design process will be the result of the DLR-internal project EDEN (Evaluation and DEsign of Novel rotorcraft concepts), which is a joint study between the Institute of Flight Systems, the Institute of Aerodynamics and Flow Technology and the Institute of Structures and Design. The complexity of rotorcraft design requires the development of the tools directly by the specialists of the respective institutes, where the tools are continuously refined and published to authorized users. The integration of the tools into a suitable software framework and the harmonization of the tools among each other are presented. This framework delivers a high level of modularity making the layout and testing of the process very flexible. The implemented tools cover the conceptual and preliminary design phases. The design process starts with an empty workspace and the minimum input of payload mass, <b>range,</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>speed,</b> number of rotor blades and a rotor configuration. Not only conventional main/tail rotor configurations can be designed, but also some other configurations with more than one main rotor. The fundamental concept behind the layout of the tools inside the process is demonstrated, especially the use of scaling and optimization loops. The process includes statistical methods to initialize the dataset, methods with more sophisticated physical models for the scaling task and finite element methods for the best possible prediction of the structural properties quite early in the design process...|$|R

Determining <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> of shark—for which such data are scarce—may help to better understand their interactions with prey, the size of the home ranges they maintain, their energetic costs and how they interact with their environment through sensory perception. In this study, the <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> of a <b>range</b> of different shark species were measured using stereo-baited remote underwater video systems (stereo-BRUVS). The relationship between <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> and fork length, species, order, habitat, trophic level, temperature and tail shape was then modelled. Fork length and species best explained the <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> of the eight species of shark studied: Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, Carcharhinus albimarginatus, Carcharhinus obscurus, Furgaleus macki, Carcharhinus obesus, Mustelus antarcticus, Heterodontus portusjacksoni and Parascyllium variolatum. This linear model had a slope that did not differ statistically from that of the theoretical model proposed by Weihs (Scale effects in animal locomotion, Academic Press, New York, pp 333 – 338, 1977), which suggests that the relationship between <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> and length appears to be dominated by energetics. The results suggest that existing allometric estimates of <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> can be improved by defining <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> for each species as a function of length. Currently, literature presents <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> data for only a few species of shark; therefore, we provide a second, generalised model, which predicts <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> as a function of length and tail shape.
