40|$|Recently, {{continuum}} elasticity {{theory has}} been applied to explain the shape transition of icosahedral viral capsids - single-protein-thick crystalline shells - from spherical to buckled/faceted as their radius increases through a critical value determined by the competition between stretching and <b>bending</b> <b>energies</b> of a closed 2 D elastic network. In the present work we generalize this approach to capsids with non-icosahedral symmetries, e. g., spherocylindrical and conical shells. One key new physical ingredient is the role played by nonzero spontaneous curvature. Another is associated with the special way in which the energy of the twelve topologically-required five-fold sites depends on the background local curvature of the shell in which they are embedded. Systematic evaluation of these contributions leads to a shape phase diagram in which transitions are observed from icosahedral to spherocylindrical capsids {{as a function of the}} ratio of stretching to <b>bending</b> <b>energies</b> and of the spontaneous curvature of the 2 D protein network. We find that the transition from icosahedral to spherocylindrical symmetry is continuous or weakly first-order near the onset of buckling, leading to extensive shape degeneracy. These results are discussed in the context of experimentally observed variations in the shapes of a variety of viral capsids. Comment: 53 pages, 17 figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Helfrich’s shape {{equation}} of axisymmetric vesciles is studied. A sufficient condition {{on the physical}} parameters and some geometric properties are discovered {{for the formation of}} biconcave shape vesicles. The study of the biconcave-discoid shape of a red blood cell has been a continued interest in the last two decades. Theoretically, the shape of the cell is to minimize a certain <b>bending</b> <b>energy.</b> Like minimal surfaces and surfaces with constant mean curvature in geometry, the expected biconcave shape surface is a critical one for the <b>bending</b> <b>energy</b> functional. The early proposal for the <b>bending</b> <b>energy</b> by Canham [1] is purely geometric, which mainly involves the Willmore functional, [15, ch. 7]. It is well known among differential geometers that the unique minimum of the Willmore functional for topologically spherical vesicles is the round sphere, which differs from blood cells observed experimentally. Thus, Willmore functional or Canham’s idea is not a good model for the shape of red blood cells. This is also observed by physicists [2]. It is known that the shape of blood cells and other biological membranes is closely related to the formation of lipid bilayer vesicle in aqueous medium. Based on this and the elasticity of lipid bilayer, Helfrich proposed a modified <b>bending</b> <b>energy,</b> [4]. For a closed surface Σ, this <b>bending</b> <b>energy</b> is a combination of geometric quantities and physical parameters. The geometric quantities are the volume V(Σ) enclosed by Σ, the area A(Σ), the mean curvature H and the Gaussian curvature K of Σ. According to the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem, the integral of K is a topological constant. Within a certain topological class of Σ, Helfrich’s <b>bending</b> <b>energy</b> can be reduced to, which we call Helfrich functional, F(Σ) = (2 H + c 0) 2 dA + ˜ λA(Σ) + ˜pV(Σ...|$|E
