5|$|The {{commercial}} use of beryllium requires {{the use of}} appropriate dust control equipment and industrial controls at all times because of the toxicity of inhaled beryllium-containing dusts that can cause a chronic life-threatening allergic disease in some people called <b>berylliosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Acute {{beryllium}} {{disease in the}} form of chemical pneumonitis was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. A survey found that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing fluorescent lamps in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases. Chronic <b>berylliosis</b> resembles sarcoidosis in many respects, and the differential diagnosis is often difficult. It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as Herbert L. Anderson.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium oxide {{is useful}} for many {{applications}} that require the combined properties of an electrical insulator and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, and a very high melting point. Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in high-power transistors in radio frequency transmitters for telecommunications. Beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the thermal conductivity of uranium dioxide nuclear fuel pellets. Beryllium compounds were used in fluorescent lighting tubes, but this use was discontinued because of the disease <b>berylliosis</b> which developed in the workers who were making the tubes.|$|E
25|$|Some {{magnetrons}} have {{beryllium oxide}} (beryllia) ceramic insulators, which are dangerous if crushed and inhaled, or otherwise ingested. Single or chronic exposure {{can lead to}} <b>berylliosis,</b> an incurable lung condition. In addition, beryllia is listed as a confirmed human carcinogen by the IARC; therefore, broken ceramic insulators or magnetrons should not be directly handled.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Anderson’s work in Italy and Brazil, he was intermittently at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Finally, he returned there in 1978 {{as a fellow}} and then a senior fellow until his death from an almost forty-year struggle with <b>berylliosis.</b> His death on July 16, 1988 at Los Alamos, New Mexico, was on the 43rd anniversary of the first test of an atomic bomb.|$|E
500|$|Approximately 35micrograms of {{beryllium}} {{is found}} in the average human body, an amount not considered harmful. Beryllium is chemically similar to magnesium and therefore can displace it from enzymes, which causes them to malfunction. Because Be2+ is a highly charged and small ion, it can easily get into many tissues and cells, where it specifically targets cell nuclei, inhibiting many enzymes, including those used for synthesizing DNA. Its toxicity is exacerbated {{by the fact that the}} body has no means to control beryllium levels, and once inside the body the beryllium cannot be removed. Chronic <b>berylliosis</b> is a pulmonary and systemic granulomatous disease caused by inhalation of dust or fumes contaminated with beryllium; either large amounts over a short time or small amounts over a long time can lead to this ailment. Symptoms of the disease can take up to five years to develop; about a third of patients with it die and the survivors are left disabled. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) lists beryllium and beryllium compounds as Category 1 carcinogens. In the US, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has designated a permissible exposure limit (PEL) in the workplace with a time-weighted average (TWA) 0.002mg/m3 [...] and a constant exposure limit of 0.005mg/m3 over 30 minutes, with a maximum peak limit of 0.025mg/m3. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of constant 0.0005mg/m3. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) value is 4mg/m3.|$|E
50|$|Of these possibilities, <b>berylliosis</b> {{presents}} most {{similarly to}} sarcoidosis. Some {{studies suggest that}} up to 6% of all cases of sarcoidosis are actually <b>berylliosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Chest {{radiography}} {{findings of}} <b>berylliosis</b> are non-specific. Early in the disease radiography findings are usually normal. In later stages interstitial fibrosis, pleural irregularities, hilar lymphadenopathy and ground-glass opacities have been reported. Findings on CT are also not specific to <b>berylliosis.</b> Findings {{that are common}} in CT scans of people with <b>berylliosis</b> include parenchymal nodules in early stages. One study found that ground-glass opacities were more commonly seen on CT scan in <b>berylliosis</b> than in sarcoidosis. In later stages hilar lymphadenopathy, intersitial pulmonary fibrosis and plueral thickening.|$|E

50|$|<b>Berylliosis,</b> {{or chronic}} {{beryllium}} disease (CBD), is a chronic allergic-type lung response and chronic lung disease caused {{by exposure to}} beryllium and its compounds, a form of beryllium poisoning. It is distinct from acute beryllium poisoning, which became rare following occupational exposure limits established around 1950. <b>Berylliosis</b> is an occupational lung disease.|$|E
50|$|Definitive {{diagnosis}} of <b>berylliosis</b> {{is based on}} history of beryllium exposures, documented beryllium sensitivity and granulomatous inflammation on lung biopsy. Given the invasive nature of a lung biopsy diagnosis can also be based on clinical history consistent with <b>berylliosis,</b> abnormal chest x-ray or CT scan findings, an abnormalities in pulmonary function tests.|$|E
50|$|Beryllium cladding, while {{advantageous}} technically, poses {{risk for}} the weapon plant employees. Machining the tamper shells produces beryllium and beryllium oxide dust; its inhalation can cause <b>berylliosis.</b> By the 1996, the US Department of Energy identified more than 50 cases of chronic <b>berylliosis</b> among nuclear industry employees, including three dozen in the Rocky Flats Plant; several died.|$|E
50|$|Acute {{beryllium}} poisoning is acute {{chemical pneumonia}} {{resulting from the}} toxic effect of beryllium in its elemental form or in various chemical compounds, and is distinct from <b>berylliosis</b> (also called chronic beryllium disease). After occupational safety procedures were put into place following {{the realization that the}} metal caused <b>berylliosis</b> around 1950, acute beryllium poisoning became extremely rare.|$|E
50|$|A Kveim test {{may be used}} to {{distinguish}} sarcoidosis from conditions with otherwise indistinguishable symptoms such as <b>berylliosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{onset of}} {{symptoms}} {{can range from}} weeks up to tens of years from the initial exposure. In some individuals a single exposure can cause <b>berylliosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Her {{studies on}} {{beryllium}} began in 1945 {{when she started}} working for the Massachusetts Division of Occupational Medicine. She studied factories that produced fluorescent bulbs in Lynn, Salem, and Ipswich, Massachusetts. She discovered {{that many of the}} workers contracted <b>berylliosis.</b> <b>Berylliosis</b> is caused by the inhalation of dust or fumes containing beryllium. The disease presents itself with coughing, weight loss, shortness of breath, and scarring of the lungs. While beryllium was a main area of study for Dr. Hardy, throughout her career, she also studied anthrax, mercury poisoning, women's growth, and physical fitness.|$|E
50|$|Beryllium and {{beryllium}} compounds {{are classified}} by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as Group 1 carcinogens; they are carcinogenic to both animals and humans. Chronic <b>berylliosis</b> is a pulmonary and systemic granulomatous disease caused {{by exposure to}} beryllium. Between 1% - 15% of people are sensitive to beryllium and may develop an inflammatory reaction in their respiratory system and skin, called chronic beryllium disease or <b>berylliosis.</b> The body's immune system recognises the beryllium as foreign particles and mounts an attack against them, usually in the lungs where they are breathed in. This can cause fever, fatigue, weakness, night sweats and difficulty in breathing.|$|E

50|$|Granulomas {{are seen}} in other chronic diseases, such as {{tuberculosis}} and sarcoidosis, and it can occasionally be hard to distinguish <b>berylliosis</b> from these disorders. Note, however, that the granulomas of CBD will typically be non-caseating, i.e. not characterized by necrosis and therefore not exhibiting a cheese-like appearance grossly.|$|E

50|$|Granulomas {{are seen}} {{in a wide variety}} of diseases, both {{infectious}} and non-infectious. Infections that are characterized by granulomas include tuberculosis, leprosy, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis and cat scratch disease. Examples of non-infectious granulomatous diseases are sarcoidosis, Crohn's disease, <b>berylliosis,</b> granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, pulmonary rheumatoid nodules and aspiration of food and other particulate material into the lung.|$|E

50|$|Progressive Massive Fibrosis (PMF), {{characterized}} {{by the development of}} large conglomerate masses of dense fibrosis (usually in the upper lung zones), can complicate silicosis and coal worker's pneumoconiosis. Conglomerate masses may also occur in other pneumoconioses, such as talcosis, <b>berylliosis</b> (CBD), kaolin pneumoconiosis, and pneumoconiosis from carbon compounds, such as carbon black, graphite, and oil shale. Conglomerate masses can also develop in sarcoidosis, but usually near the hilae and with surrounding paracitricial emphysema.|$|E
50|$|A {{granuloma}} is the body's way {{of dealing}} with a substance it cannot remove or sterilize. Infectious causes of granulomas (infections are typically {{the most common cause of}} granulomas) include tuberculosis, leprosy, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, and cat scratch disease. Examples of non-infectious granulomatous diseases are sarcoidosis, Crohn's disease, <b>berylliosis,</b> giant-cell arteritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, pulmonary rheumatoid nodules, and aspiration of food and other particulate material into the lung. The infectious pathophysiology of granulomas is discussed primarily here.|$|E
50|$|Schaumann's name is {{associated}} with the Besnier-Boeck-Schaumann disease. In 1917 he published an article on the disease, from which the systemic nature of the disease came to be realized by the medical community. His name is also lent to Schaumann bodies, which are calcium-containing inclusion bodies found in the cytoplasm of giant cells in sarcoidosis and <b>berylliosis.</b> Schaumann bodies were initially described in 1871 by Oscar von Schüppel (1837-1881), a pathologist at the University of Tübingen. Following retirement, Schaumann conducted research involving new aspects of benign lymphogranulomatosis.|$|E
50|$|With {{single or}} {{prolonged}} exposure by inhalation the lungs may become sensitized to beryllium. <b>Berylliosis</b> has an insidious onset and runs an indolent course. Some {{people who are}} sensitized to beryllium may not have symptoms. Continued exposure causes the development of small inflammatory nodules, called granulomas. Of note, the authors of a 2006 study suggested that beryllium inhalation {{was not the only}} form of exposure and perhaps skin exposure was also a cause, as they found that a reduction in beryllium inhalation did not result in a reduction in CBD or beryllium sensitization.|$|E
5000|$|The general {{population}} {{is unlikely to}} develop acute or chronic beryllium disease because ambient air levels of beryllium are normally very low (<0.03 ng/m3). [...] However, a study found 1% of people living within 3/4 of a mile of a beryllium plant in Lorain, Ohio, had <b>berylliosis</b> after exposure to concentrations estimated {{to be less than}} 1 milligram per cubic metre of air. In the United States the Beryllium Case Registry contained 900 records, early cases relating to extraction and fluorescent lamp manufacture, later ones coming from the aerospace, ceramics and metallurgical industries.|$|E

5000|$|The {{tribunal}} {{was established}} {{pursuant to the}} [...] as an inferior court and a court of record. An appeal may lie to the Court of Appeal of New South Wales in certain circumstances. It has exclusive jurisdiction to deal with claims for injuries arising out of the diseases such as aluminosis, asbestosis, asbestos induced carcinoma, asbestos related pleural disease, bagassosis, <b>berylliosis,</b> byssinosis, coal dust pneumoconiosis, farmers’ lung, hard metal pneumoconiosis, pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, silicosis, silico-tuberculosis and talcosis. It also has jurisdiction over any other pathological condition of the lungs, pleura or peritoneum that is attributable to dust. In certain circumstances, dependents may also sue in the tribunal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Berylliosis</b> is an {{occupational}} disease. Relevant occupations are those where beryllium is mined, processed or converted into metal alloys, or where machining of metals containing beryllium and recycling of scrap alloys occurs. It {{is associated with}} aerospace manufacturing, microwave semiconductor electronics, beryllium mining or manufacturing of fluorescent light bulbs (which once contained beryllium compounds in their internal phosphor coating). Beryllia was used in lamp manufacture because of ceramic's obvious virtues for insulation and heat resistance, and also because beryllia could be made transparent. Certain welding anodes along with other electrical contacts and even non-sparking tools are made of beryllium copper alloy and the subsequent machining of such materials would cause the disease as well.|$|E
50|$|Returning to Stanford in 1945 {{as a full}} professor, he {{embarked}} {{on the construction of}} a series of linear accelerators based on klystron technology and of GeV performance. Along with the Varian brothers and Edward Ginzton, he co-founded Varian Associates in 1948. Sadly, he was never to see the completion of the klystron project. He died at age 39 in Palo Alto, California of <b>berylliosis</b> and fibrosis of the lungs, caused by inhaling the beryllium used in his research. In 1947, the Hansen Experimental Physics Laboratory (HEPL) was founded as a facility at Stanford University. The facility is designed to promote interdisciplinary enterprises across different branches of science and was named in his honor.|$|E

40|$|Prevalence of <b>berylliosis,</b> a lung {{disorder}} {{driven by}} the activation of beryllium-specific T cells, {{is associated with a}} major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II marker (HLA-DPB 1 Glu 69) and with the type of industrial exposure. We evaluated the interaction between marker and exposure in a beryllium-exposed population in which the prevalence of <b>berylliosis</b> was associated with machining beryllium. The presence of the marker was associated with higher prevalence (HLA-DPB 1 Glu 69 -positive machinists 25 %; HLA-DPB 1 Glu 69 -negative machinists 3. 2 %, P = 0. 05) and predicted <b>berylliosis</b> independent of machining history (odds ratios 11. 8 and 10. 1). The study shows that in <b>berylliosis</b> the carrier status of a genetic susceptibility factor adds to the effect of process-related risk factors...|$|E
40|$|Pulmonary <b>berylliosis,</b> {{a chronic}} {{allergic}} pneumosclerosis resulting from inhalation of beryllium compounds, may occur in two clinical forms: interstitial, which is mild, slowly progressive, and presents moderate skin reactions of delayed-type hypersensitivity to haptens; and granulomatous, which is rapidly progressive {{after a short}} latent period and presents systemic lesions and significant allergic skin reactions. The investigation of experimental <b>berylliosis</b> in rats has revealed some factors {{that could lead to}} the abolition of natural tolerance. Six new beryllium-containing autoantigens, two of which accumulated in different tissues, were identified in the lung nucleoproteins accompanying a partial loss of normal tissue and serum antigens. Antibodies to the new antigens and to normal lung tissue (in smaller amounts) were found in the sera of rats with experimental <b>berylliosis,</b> as well as in patients. The patients with granulomatous <b>berylliosis</b> also had antibodies to DNA, RNA, and extracts of normal homologous heart, spleen, liver, and thyroid in quantities that correlated with the clinical picture and with the effectiveness of glucocorticoid therapy. The fact that natural tolerance mechanisms were interrupted in all cases and autoimmune granulomatous <b>berylliosis</b> developed only in some patients led to the assumption that the mechanism was effective under the influence of additional endogenous factors; diseases producing an accumulation of autoantibodies could provide the stimulus for the appearance of these factors...|$|E
40|$|<b>Berylliosis</b> is an {{environmental}} chronic inflammatory disorder of the lung caused by inhalation of beryllium dusts, {{characterized by the}} accumulation of CD 4 + T cells and macrophages in the lower respiratory tract.

In exposed workers, genetic susceptibility to this granulomatous disorder is associated with major histocompatibility gene and the TNF-alpha gene. The HLA-DP glutamic 69 residue was shown to be the MHC genetic marker associated with disease susceptibility; furthermore the TNF-alpha TNFA- 308 * 2 allele {{was found to be}} independently associated with HLA-DP Glu 69 in the determination of <b>berylliosis</b> risk...|$|E
