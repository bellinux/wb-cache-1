5|$|By 287 BC, the {{economic}} {{condition of the}} average plebeian had become poor. The problem appears to have centered around widespread indebtedness. The plebeians demanded relief, but the senators refused to address their situation. The result was the final plebeian secession. The plebeians seceded to the Janiculum hill. To end the secession, a dictator was appointed. The dictator passed a law (the Lex Hortensia), which ended the requirement that the patrician senators must agree before any <b>bill</b> <b>could</b> be considered by the Plebeian Council. This {{was not the first}} law to require that an act of the Plebeian Council have the full force of law. The Plebeian Council acquired this power during a modification to the original Valerian law in 449 BC. The significance of this law was in the fact that it robbed the patricians of their final weapon over the plebeians. The result was that control over the state fell, not onto the shoulders of voters, but to the new plebeian nobility.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Majority Leader Gary Hooser's {{statement that he}} intended to bring the bill to a vote before the full Senate, the Hawaii Family Forum stated other issues demanded more attention than civil unions and the bill would create legal challenges for child care and education. The group held demonstrations on Maui and Kauai and stated their intention to hold demonstrations to ask the governor to veto the legislation should the bill advance. Hooser argued for the bill using President Barack Obama's support of civil unions and the support of labor unions and the majority of Hawaii House representatives. The Honolulu Advertiser reported that Senate President Colleen Hanabusa privately told senators the <b>bill</b> <b>could</b> lead to a lawsuit to legalize same-sex marriage. The American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii and Supreme Court of Hawaii judge Steven H. Levinson told the legislature that a lawsuit would have little chance of success.|$|E
5|$|In the 1892 election, South Carolinians {{passed a}} {{non-binding}} referendum calling for prohibition. Bills were introduced into {{both houses of}} the state legislature that December to accomplish this, and passed the House of Representatives. Before the House <b>bill</b> <b>could</b> be passed by the Senate, Tillman sent a proposal {{in the form of}} an amendment, with instructions to pass the amended bill, and enact nothing else on the subject. Based on a system that had been successful in Athens, Georgia, the bill banned the private sale of alcohol, setting up a system of dispensaries that would sell alcohol in sealed containers—sale by the drink, and consumption on the premises, would not be permitted. Both houses passed Tillman's amendment, though there was opposition both within and outside the legislature. The dispensary system went into effect on July 1, 1893.|$|E

50|$|The school faced several tough choices. The school owned two buildings. It was {{a painful}} choice, but the school’s board {{decided to sell}} one of its buildings, so that <b>bills</b> <b>could</b> be paid and {{agreements}} kept.|$|R
30|$|<b>Bills</b> <b>could</b> {{be issued}} {{requiring}} payment {{in a foreign}} country or city with a different currency. Since they dominated international payments during the nineteenth century, bills of exchange determined the relevant foreign currency price for cross-border business (see, e.g. Denzel 2010, ch. 3.3). As such, the market exchange rates quoted for foreign <b>bills</b> <b>could</b> deviate from the mint-par. More specifically, when the demand for bills on a foreign currency was relatively high and/or the supply relatively low, the market exchange rate of that currency appreciated. What will be important for interest parity considerations is that fluctuations of the market exchange rate occurred with sight as well as with long-bills.|$|R
5|$|The {{advantages}} to this method were that bills were substantially cheaper, and unlike writs did not tie the plaintiff down; once the case came to court the <b>bill</b> <b>could</b> be amended to include any action or actions the plaintiff wanted to enforce. In addition, by avoiding the Chancery writ, {{the case was}} substantially cheaper. The result of this was substantial; between 1560 and 1640, the King's Bench's business rose tenfold. This period also saw a substantial broadening of the remedies available in the common law. The main remedy and method was action on the case, which justices expanded to encompass other things. In 1499 it enabled the enforcement of parol promises, which rendered Chancery subpoenas obsolete; later developments included the recovery of debts, suing for defamatory words (previously an ecclesiastical matter) and action on the case for trover and conversion. Most of this reform took place under Fineux CJ, who never lived {{to see the results}} of his work; it took over 100 years for the reforms to fully reverse the decline in business.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} {{carried over into}} the 2010 session and Lingle stated in January 2010 that the bill was a {{distraction}} from the budget {{and should not be}} voted on for final passage in the Senate. Senator Brian Taniguchi argued the legislature could work on several issues simultaneously and the bill would pass. If passed, the amended bill would have to be approved by the House of Representatives. Speaker of the House Calvin Say stated that a vote on the bill would depend on whether the Senate passed the bill with enough votes to override a gubernatorial veto, arguing that {{he does not want to}} force a vote on controversial legislation in an election year if the bill's approval was in doubt. The Senate bill contains an effective date of January 1, 2010, and if the language is not changed, the <b>bill</b> <b>could</b> be vetoed regardless of its content.|$|E
5|$|Mills's and Cleveland's defeat on the tariff <b>bill</b> <b>could</b> be {{considered}} a victory for Randall, but the vote showed how isolated the former Speaker's protectionist ideas now made him in his party: only four Democrats voted against the tariff reductions. The state party likewise turned against Randall and toward free trade, adopting a pro-tariff revision platform at the 1888 state Democratic convention. At the same time, Randall seemingly reversed his long-standing commitment to fiscal economy by voting with the Republicans to override Cleveland's veto of the Dependent and Disability Pension Act. The Act would have given a pension to every Union veteran (or their widows) who claimed {{he could no longer}} perform physical labor, regardless of whether his disability was war-related. Cleveland's veto was in line with his record of small-government cost-cutting, with which Randall would normally have sympathized. Randall, perhaps in an effort to gain favor with veterans in his district, joined the Republicans in an unsuccessful attempt to override Cleveland's veto. Another possibility proposed by biographer House is that Randall saw the federal budget surplus as reason to cut tariffs; by increasing federal spending, he hoped to decrease the surplus and maintain the need for high tariffs. Whatever the reason, the attempt failed and left Randall further alienated from his fellow Democrats.|$|E

5|$|On 6 April 1960, Heffron {{attempted}} {{to send the}} bill back to the council, which returned it to the assembly on the same grounds as before. As {{a result of the}} deadlock, Heffron requested the Governor to order a joint session of parliament on 20 April, a session which lasted two hours and was boycotted by the opposition. On 12 May the Assembly resolved that the bill be submitted for a referendum. However, later that day the leader of the opposition in the Legislative Council, Hector Clayton, started legal action against the government on the grounds that under section 5B of the NSW Constitution, the council had neither voted nor deliberated on the bill and thus the <b>bill</b> <b>could</b> not be submitted for a referendum. In the case of Clayton v. Heffron (1960) a majority of the full bench of the Supreme Court of New South Wales (headed by Chief Justice Evatt) found in favour of the government four to one {{on the grounds that they}} had complied fully with the intention of section 5B, while also denying the plaintiff leave to appeal to the High Court. The subsequent appeal to the New South Wales Court of Appeal was rejected by Chief Judge in Equity McLelland on 10 October. In a subsequent case to the High Court, Clayton argued that section 15 of the Commonwealth Constitution, which dealt with the process by which state parliaments filled senate vacancies, entrenched the requirement for such parliaments to be bicameral on account of its exclusive mention of both houses. This was rejected by the court that affirmed that the mention did not exclude the right of state parliaments to do as they saw fit regarding abolition or reform.|$|E
25|$|In August 2013, the California State Senate passed California Senate Constitutional Amendment No. 5, {{which would}} have {{effectively}} repealed Proposition 209.

25|$|A {{bipartisan}} {{group of}} legislators {{introduced a bill}} in the 2007 Georgia legislative session that would allow Wilson's sentence to be reduced by the courts. This session was adjourned in April, before the <b>bill</b> <b>could</b> be considered. Several legislators have subsequently called for a rare special session of the Legislature to reconsider the bill.|$|E
25|$|As a {{response}} to the rising union movement and Cold War hostilities, the <b>bill</b> <b>could</b> be seen as {{a response}} by business to the post–World War II labor upsurge of 1946. During the year after V-J Day, more than five million American workers were involved in strikes, which lasted on average four times longer than those during the war.|$|E
25|$|The Home Rule Bill just {{failed to}} pass the House of Lords, but the Lords' diminished power under the Parliament Act 1911 meant that the <b>Bill</b> <b>could</b> only be delayed, not stopped. It {{was placed on the}} statute books with Royal Assent in September 1914, but its {{implementation}} was suspended {{for the duration of the}} First World War.|$|E

She {{warned that the}} state will destroy the system, that is rated as the fifth best {{of its kind in}} the world. She outlined the possibility that the <b>Bill</b> <b>could</b> drive away thousands of skilled medical professionals. Together with her political party, she proposed an alternative health plan, for the privatisation of state healthcare. The National Health Amendment Act became law in 2013, and provides for the establishment of a new Office of Health Standards Compliance.|$|E
25|$|The House was {{supposed}} to break for the summer Thursday June 23, but remained open in an extended session due to the filibuster. The 103 NDP MPs had been taking it in turn to deliver 20 minute speeches – plus 10 minutes of questions and comments – in order to delay {{the passing of the}} bill. MPs are allowed to give such speeches each time a vote takes place, and many votes were needed before the <b>bill</b> <b>could</b> be passed. As the Conservative Party of Canada held a majority in the House, the bill passed. This was the longest filibuster since the 1999 Reform Party of Canada filibuster, on native treaty issues in British Columbia.|$|E
