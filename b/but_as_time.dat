5|$|Radio {{became popular}} in Germany during the 1930s, with over 70 percent of {{households}} owning a receiver by 1939, {{more than any other}} country. Radio station staffs were purged of leftists and others deemed undesirable by July 1933. Propaganda and speeches were typical radio fare immediately after the seizure of power, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>time</b> went on Goebbels insisted that more music be played so that listeners would not turn to foreign broadcasters for entertainment.|$|E
5|$|With Brisbane {{unable to}} provide any {{rational}} explanation for Shaw's condition her family and their local parish minister concluded that she must be possessed and being tormented by witches, a common occurrence in England and Scotland and a central element in the Salem witch trials a few years earlier. The church set up a weekly fast and prayer meeting at Bargarron House, and Shaw's father appealed to the authorities that those named by his daughter as tormenting her should be arrested. She had initially identified only Catherine Campbell and Agnes Naismith, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>time</b> wore on she implicated others, and eventually 35 were accused. Ten were male and twenty female; the genders and identities of the remaining five are unknown.|$|E

5|$|Eichmann did {{not make}} policy, but acted in an {{operational}} capacity. Specific deportation orders came from Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. Eichmann's office was responsible for collecting information on the Jews in each area, organising the seizure of their property, and arranging for and scheduling trains. His department was in constant contact with the Foreign Office, as Jews of conquered nations such as France could not as easily be stripped of their possessions and deported to their deaths. Eichmann held regular meetings in his Berlin offices with his department members {{working in the field}} and travelled extensively to visit concentration camps and ghettos. His wife, who disliked Berlin, resided in Prague with the children. Eichmann initially visited them weekly, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>time</b> went on, his visits tapered off to once a month.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} Wiesenthal's protests, in late 1963 his centre in Vienna {{was taken over}} by a local {{community}} group, so he immediately set up a new independent office, funded using donations and his stipend from the Mossad. As the 20-year statute of limitations for German war crimes was about to expire, Wiesenthal began lobbying to have it extended or removed entirely. In March 1965 the Bundestag deferred the matter for five years, effectively extending the expiration date. Similar action was taken by the Austrian government. <b>But</b> <b>as</b> <b>time</b> went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions. Witnesses grew older and {{were less likely to be}} able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, as the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Māori {{language}} (te reo Māori) {{was permitted}} in native schools to facilitate English instruction, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>time</b> went on official attitudes hardened against any {{use of the}} language. Māori were discouraged from speaking their own language in schools and work places and it existed as a community language only in a few remote areas. The language underwent a revival beginning in the 1970s, and now more people speak Māori. The future of the language {{was the subject of}} a claim before the Waitangi Tribunal in 1985. As a result, Māori was declared an official language in 1987. In the 2013 census, 21.3percent of Māori people—and 3.7percent of all respondents, including some non-Māori people—reported conversational fluency in the language. There are now Māori language immersion schools and two Māori Television channels, the only nationwide television channels to have the majority of their prime-time content delivered in Māori. Many places have officially been given dual Māori and English names in recent years.|$|E
50|$|Another {{controversy}} regarding Mr. Jaiswal arose when during {{attending a}} cultural event in Kanpur he made sexist remarks against women by saying '(A new victory {{and a new}} marriage have their own importance. <b>But</b> <b>as</b> <b>times</b> passes, the memories of a victory go old and <b>as</b> <b>time</b> passes, a wife gets old, the same charm is not there) although he later apologized. His remarks received nationwide criticism and even a petition was filed against him in the Court by Women Organizations.|$|R

5|$|Originally, {{vegetables}} {{were collected}} from the wild by hunter-gatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world, probably during the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new agricultural way of life developed. At first, plants which grew locally would have been cultivated, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>time</b> went on, trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays, most vegetables are grown {{all over the world}} as climate permits, and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations. China is the largest producer of vegetables and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries. The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food, to agribusinesses with vast acreages of single-product crops. Depending on the type of vegetable concerned, harvesting the crop is followed by grading, storing, processing, and marketing.|$|E
5|$|Ryzhkov was {{an early}} {{supporter}} of the Gorbachev policy calling {{for an increase in}} {{the quantity and quality of}} goods planned for production during the period of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (19861990). To achieve these goals, the government pumped money into the machine-building sector <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>time</b> went by, Gorbachev increasingly diverged from his original stance. He now wanted to increase overall investment in nearly all industrial sectors; a move which Ryzhkov knew was a budgetary impossibility. However, Ryzhkov's economic policies were not much better as he continued to advocate an unreasonable increase in the production of consumer goods. Gorbachev and Ligachev's anti-alcohol campaign was opposed by Ryzhkov, who agreed with the State Planning Committee and the Ministry of Trade that such a drive would deprive from the state billions of rubles in income. Nevertheless, the campaign went ahead, losing the Soviet Government millions in revenues. Ryzhkov's opposition to the campaign was strengthened by his belief that both Gorbachev and Ligachev placed ideology before practical considerations, and he instead advocated an alternative long-term program rather than one designed to have immediate effect.|$|E
5|$|Yuu is {{the protagonist}} of Charlotte. He {{develops}} a rude and narcissistic personality once he discovers {{he has the ability}} to take over another person's body for five seconds, but the true nature of his ability enables him to steal someone's superhuman ability by possessing them. Yuu is a first-year student at Hoshinoumi Academy, and he is forced to join its student council. Initially a fake honors student and chronic cheater, Yuu is reluctant to use his ability to aide the student council, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>time</b> goes on, he becomes less narcissistic and much more selfless and caring towards others. Over the course of the story, he becomes a fan of the post-rock band Zhiend and falls in love with Nao. After Yuu travels worldwide to steal every ability user's power to protect them from being exploited, the strain of it causes him to lose all of his past memories. His older brother is Shunsuke and his younger sister is Ayumi.|$|E

25|$|A {{major problem}} for Spanish rulers of Honduras was the {{activity}} of the English along the northern Caribbean coast.

25|$|The Chinese used {{silver in}} their {{jewellery}} more than gold. Blue kingfisher feathers were tied onto early Chinese jewellery and later, blue gems and glass {{were incorporated into}} designs. However, jade was preferred over any other stone. The Chinese revered jade because of the human-like qualities they assigned to it, such as its hardness, durability, and beauty. The first jade pieces were very simple, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>time</b> progressed, more complex designs evolved. Jade rings from between the 4th and 7th centuries BC show evidence of having been worked with a compound milling machine, hundreds of years before the first mention of such equipment in the west.|$|E
25|$|Early {{settlers}} to {{the region}} were hunter-gatherer tribes {{similar to those in}} North Alabama. A variety of Native American populations visited the area that would become Daphne including Tensaw, Choctaw, Creek and Seminole. This area {{came to be known as}} neutral ground where tribes would meet and discuss the relationships between their nations. Small groups worked together to acquire food and to provide for their families. Initially, these groups enjoyed an economy based upon hunting and scavenging <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>time</b> passed production of weapons and pottery became more advanced. During the late Woodland stage Native Americans began to practice more elaborate ritual services. Although no burial grounds are known in Daphne, they are scattered throughout nearby Baldwin County.|$|E
25|$|Presley {{had to do}} no {{more than}} provide RCA with three albums a year, and his film soundtracks did that for him. With no touring or public {{appearances}} to be made, Parker was able to keep costs to a minimum. For the first few years Presley's films were somewhat successful, his albums topped the charts, and any singles that were released were mostly hits. <b>But</b> <b>as</b> <b>time</b> went on, as the Beatles began their dominance of the music charts and the worldwide phenomenon known as Beatlemania began, Presley became less and less successful. His films still made money and his albums still sold well, but the profits were falling. This led Parker to insist that films be made cheaply, on a strict schedule, and with as little hassle as possible.|$|E
