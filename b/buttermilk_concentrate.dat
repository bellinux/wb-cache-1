It is established {{that the development of}} milk-plant minced mass technology from <b>buttermilk</b> <b>concentrate</b> is an important task that will expand the range of combined minced masses with high nutritional and biological value. The results of study of biological value of milk-plant minced mass from <b>buttermilk</b> <b>concentrate</b> are presented in the article. The indispensable amino acid score of prototypes was calculated and the digestion degree and relative biological value of the developed minced masses were defined. The study results show that the protein composition of developed minced mass does not include limiting amino acid, while the level of all essential amino acids exceeds the standards of FAO / WHO and the protein of developed minced masses is characterized by the high digestion degree, enabling their widespread use in the production of culinary products in restaurants...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} effect of {{buttermilk}} fractions on growth, iron transport, and uptake, Caco- 2 cells (human colon adenocarcinoma) were grown in a bicameral chamber. The Caco- 2 cell culture system is a useful model to study micronutrient utilization in the human enterocyte, because Caco- 2 cells continuously differentiate and form a monolayer, which has high polarity, a well-developed brush border, and a tight junction. Iron bioavailabilty in various milks is very different depending upon milk composition. The fat fraction especially is known to be associated with iron absorption, because the fat fraction has milk fat globule membrane (MFGM), which contains bioactive molecules such as sphingolipids. Composition of <b>buttermilk</b> that was <b>concentrated</b> by 10 K molecular sieving (MS) or by bacterial fermentation (Lactococcus latis PN-l) was reduced in lactose concentration and increased in protein concentration. Percent fat in MS <b>buttermilk</b> was <b>concentrated</b> to two times higher than in the original buttermilk (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Growth of Caco- 2 cells with molecular sieved (MS) or fermented (FM) buttermilk in the growth medium was not significantly different. Transport and uptake of 59 Fe was performed with/without cold iron (1 mmol/L) by iron-depleted or iron-repleted cells. Molecular sieved or fermented buttermilk and ganglioside or sphingomyelin standards with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were added to the Hank 2 ̆ 7 s balance salt solution (HBSS) in the apical chamber. With cold iron, addition of MS and FM buttermilk (1, 2, or 3 percent) increased 59 Fe transport across iron-repleted cells (P 3 ̆c 0. 01). Without cold iron, ganglioside depressed 59 Fe transport (P 3 ̆c 0. 01). Uptake of 59 Fe was not significantly affected by buttermilk concentrates; however, more effective uptake was shown across iron-depleted cells. It is not clear from these studies that buttermilk fractions or their components influence iron uptake or transport by Caco- 2 cell cultures...|$|R
