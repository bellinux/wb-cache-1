5|$|On November 3, 1828, President John Quincy Adams, having <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> executions {{would likely}} spark another uprising, pardoned the prisoners in {{exchange}} for a land cession. In July and August 1829, in treaties signed at Prairie du Chien, the Three Fires Confederacy and the Ho-Chunks formally ceded the lead mining region to the United States for annual payments of $16,000 and $18,000 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin had <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Beagle was {{expected}} to sail {{about the end of}} September 1831, but fitting out took longer. The Admiralty Instructions were received on 14 November, and on 23 November she was moved to anchorage, ready to depart. Repeated Westerly gales caused delays, and forced them to turn back after departing on 10 and 21 December. Drunkenness at Christmas lost another day. Finally, on the morning of 27 December, the Beagle left its anchorage in the Barn Pool, under Mount Edgecumbe {{on the west side of}} Plymouth Sound and set out on its surveying expedition.|$|E
5|$|During the Singer World Series {{tournament in}} Sri Lanka in September 1994, which {{involved}} India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Australia, the Australian team {{stayed at the}} Oberoi Hotel in the capital Colombo. There was a casino {{in close proximity to}} the hotel, which Waugh and Warne visited. Team manager Colin Egar had advised Warne that he had <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> venue was unsavoury, but he was vague in his comments, and at the time, casinos were not perceived as trouble spots or traps for unwary cricketers.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the mostly}} {{negative}} reception, Game Informer and Dave Halverson of Play Magazine defended the game. Game Informer {{described it as}} ambitious and praised the graphics, story, amount of content, and replay value, though the publication still believed that only fans of the franchise would enjoy the game. Halverson initially gave the Xbox360 version a 9.5/10, praising each character's controls and abilities and calling it the best 3D Sonic game yet. In the following issue, Halverson reassessed it as 8.5/10, writing that he had <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> load times and glitches in his review copy {{would not be in}} {{the final version of the}} game. In a later review of the PlayStation3 version, Halverson was frustrated that the problems had still not been corrected and that the performance was worse despite the extra development time; Halverson gave the PS3 version a 5.5/10.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with one}} last push over {{mountains}} that {{were described as}} much worse than the Wasatch, the ragtag company had {{to decide whether to}} forge ahead or rest their cattle. It was October 20 and they had <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pass would not be snowed in until the middle of November. William Pike was killed when a gun being loaded by William Foster was discharged negligently, an event that seemed to make the decision for them; family by family, they resumed their journey, first the Breens, then Kesebergs, Stanton with the Reeds, Graveses, and Murphys. The Donners waited and traveled last. After a few miles of rough terrain, an axle broke on one of the Donners' wagons. Jacob and George went into the woods to fashion a replacement. George Donner sliced his hand open while chiseling the wood, but it seemed a superficial wound.|$|E
5|$|Like so much else, {{this is hard}} to say, but {{the balance}} of historians' judgements is that there {{may well have been}} bishops based in Llanbadarn for a period, or even periods, in Celtic times. Church {{organisation}} in early medieval (pre-1100) Wales was flexible, and there were no fixed dioceses. The claim in Padarn's Life that he was bishop of Ceredigion reflects a tradition, but the actual area of the saint's influence was in north Ceredigion and what is now Radnorshire (mid-Powys). Ceredigion south of the river Wyre was David country. Some time after this the church is said to have lost its episcopal privileges. The church is thought to have been annexed, after the dissolution of the see, to that of St David's; although as with much of the early history this is uncertain. Bishops at this time were, in Wales, rather more itinerant than they later became, and diocesan boundaries much more fluid than they were later. Gerald of Wales (Gerald de Barri, better known as Giraldus Cambrensis), reported that he had <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bishopric had been lost because at some time past Llanbadarn's bishop had been murdered and the church lands appropriated by his killers, the forerunners of the clas which held the church {{at the time of his}} visit in 1188.|$|E

5|$|On 21 July, Mickl wrote {{a letter}} in which he stated that he wished to again be a {{battalion}} or regimental commander, so as to not {{have to deal with}} such a large frontline. That day he had <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> next day he should expect Choltitz to return and take over command, but instead he spent a further three weeks commanding the 11th Panzer Division in heavy fighting against Soviet attacks. Finally, on 12 August he received a message advising that he was to be relieved by Generalmajor Wend von Wietersheim, who arrived that same day. Four days later, Mickl returned to Gera, disappointed and resentful about the demotion, as he felt that he had made a good enough impression during the fighting to be retained as commander of the division. The reason behind his relief is unclear. His performance commanding the division had not been markedly worse than comparable divisional commanders during the preceding battles, and it is possible that Wehrmacht or Army Headquarters had decided Mickl was better suited to fighting insurgents in his native Balkans, especially given his fluency in several local languages.|$|E
25|$|One of Glushko's first acts was {{to suspend}} the N-1 program, which however was not {{formally}} terminated until 1976. He then began work on a completely new HLV. During this time, the US was developing the Space Shuttle and Soviet premier Leonid Brezhnev had <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Shuttle was actually being constructed as an orbiting weapon system that could drop a nuclear bomb onto Moscow, bypassing all Soviet detection systems. Although the rumor was completely false, Brezhnev believed it anyway and ordered {{the development of a}} Soviet Space Shuttle.|$|E
25|$|The United States Radium Corporation was a company, {{most notorious}} for its {{operations}} between the years 1917 to 1926 in Orange, New Jersey, in the United States {{that led to}} stronger worker protection laws. After initial success in developing a glow-in-the-dark radioactive paint, the company was subject to several lawsuits in the late 1920s {{in the wake of}} severe illnesses and deaths of workers (the Radium Girls) who had ingested radioactive material. The workers had <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> paint was harmless. During World War I and World War II, the company produced luminous watches and gauges for the United States Army for use by soldiers.|$|E

25|$|The {{island is}} {{relatively}} arid because {{it lies in}} the rain shadow of Kauai, and lacks the elevation needed to catch significant amounts of trade wind rainfall. Niihau therefore, depends for its rain on winter Kona storms, when more northerly weather systems intrude into the region. As such, the island is subject to long periods of drought. Historical droughts on Niihau have been recorded several times, one in 1792 by Captain James Cook's former junior officer, George Vancouver, who had <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> people of Niihau had abandoned the island because of a severe drought and had moved to Kauai to escape famine.|$|E
25|$|Reliant was {{dismantled}} by the National Maritime Museum and sectioned {{for display}} in {{pride of place}} in the Museum's Neptune Hall, where it remained on display until 2005. The tug was then controversially removed and scrapped as a cost reduction exercise, with only a single engine and a sectioned representation of one paddle wheel remaining on display (as had been originally intended back in 1969). Further controversy followed as members of the public complained to have <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tug, having been visited by many during its nearly 25 years on display, had been put into 'storage' when this was not the case.|$|E
25|$|Following the fire, the Conservative {{leader of}} the council, Nicholas Paget-Brown said that the Grenfell Tower {{residents}} {{did not have a}} collective view in favour of installing sprinklers during the recent renovations. He also said that if they had been installed, it would have delayed the refurbishment and been more disruptive. ITV business editor Joel Hills stated that he had <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> installation of sprinklers had not even been discussed. In a 2012 report, the British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association said that sprinklers could be retrofitted in Grenfell Tower for an average cost of £1,150 per flat, which would have added up to a total cost of £138,000 for the whole block.|$|E

25|$|In March 2016, it was {{reported}} that MI6 had been involved in the Libyan Civil War since January of that year, escorted by the SAS, to meet with Libyan officials to discuss the supplying of weapons and training for the Syrian Army and the militias fighting against ISIS. In April 2016, it was revealed that MI6 teams with members of the Special Reconnaissance Regiment seconded to them had been deployed to Yemen to train Yemeni forces fighting AQAP, as well as identifying targets for drone strikes. In November 2016, the Independent reported that MI6, MI5 and GCHQ supplied the SAS and other British special forces- as part of a multinational special forces operation- a list (compiled from intelligence) of 200 British jihadist to kill or capture before they attempt to return to the UK. The 200 male and female jihadists are senior members of ISIS that pose a direct threat to the UK; Sources said SAS soldiers have <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mission could be the most important in the regiment’s 75-year history.|$|E
25|$|As Simple Minds' main writing team, Kerr and Burchill had {{continued}} to demo and originate material by themselves. For the latest sessions they had shared studio space with a band called Sly Silver Sly who featured Jim Kerr's brother Mark (previously the drummer with Gun) and bass guitarist Eddie Duffy, and who were working with American songwriter Kevin Hunter. While in the studio, the two writing and recording projects (including the Hunter co-writes) merged to become the sessions for the next Simple Minds album, Our Secrets Are the Same. Once again, Forbes and Gaynor found themselves out of the band: Mark Kerr became the new drummer and Eddie Duffy joined on bass guitar. The new-look Simple Minds made their début with a short set of greatest hits at the Scotland Rocks For Kosovo festival, with Mark Taylor returning on keyboards. The displaced Forbes and Gaynor, having apparently <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> band was not appearing at the festival, formed a new band of their own to play the same concert.|$|E
25|$|Wilder {{moved with}} her family from Wisconsin in the year 1869, when she was two years old. They stopped in Rothville, Missouri, and settled in Kansas, in Indian country near what is now Independence. Her younger sister Carrie (1870–1946) was born there in August 1870, not long before they moved again. According to Wilder in later years, her father had <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{location}} would soon be open to white settlers but that was incorrect; their homestead was actually on the Osage Indian reservation {{and they had no}} legal right to occupy it. They had just begun to farm when they heard rumors that the settlers would be evicted, and they departed in spring of 1871. Although Laura portrayed the leave and that of other settlers as prompted by rumors of eviction in both her novel and in her Pioneer Girl memoirs, in the memoirs she also noted that her parents needed to recover their Wisconsin land because the buyer had not paid the entire mortgage. Several Kansas neighbors apparently were allowed to buy the land they had settled on so the rumors may have been untrue.|$|E

500|$|In the Nintendo Powers November2010 issue, {{in celebration}} of the NES' 25th anniversary in North America, Horii {{recalled}} the making of Dragon Warrior. Horiii was a fan of basic RPG mechanics, and wanted to simplify the interfaces; he said that many other RPGs' interfaces at the time [...] "were so complicated that they intimidated new users". He said that Dragon Warriors simplified gameplay made the game appealing to people and made the franchise successful. he had <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> NES lacked sufficient capacity for RPGs, which further motivated him to make one.|$|E
500|$|When the British force {{returned}} from Oriskany {{they arrived at}} a camp that had been stripped of much, including personal belongings and the blankets the Indians slept in.

They had <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> white men, who had thus far fought relatively little, would do most of the fighting.
