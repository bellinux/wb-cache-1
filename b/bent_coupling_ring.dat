40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} coupling delays on the synchronization properties of several network motifs. In particular, we analyze the synchronization patterns of unidirectionally <b>coupled</b> <b>rings,</b> bidirectionally <b>coupled</b> <b>rings,</b> and open chains of Kuramoto oscillators. Our approach includes an analytical and semianalytical study of the existence and stability of different in-phase and out-of-phase periodic solutions, complemented by numerical simulations. The delay is found to act differently on networks possessing different symmetries. While for the unidirectionally <b>coupled</b> <b>ring</b> the <b>coupling</b> delay is mainly observed to induce multistability, its effect on bidirectionally <b>coupled</b> <b>rings</b> is to enhance the most symmetric solution. We also study the influence of feedback and conclude that it also promotes the in-phase solution of the coupled oscillators. We finally discuss the relation between our theoretical results on delay-coupled Kuramoto oscillators and the synchronization properties of networks consisting of real-world delay-coupled oscillators, such as semiconductor laser arrays and neuronal circuits.

Unidirectional ring lasers have the advantages that, in the favoured emission direction, they can have up to double the quantum efficiency of bidirectional lasers and do not suffer from spatial hole burning. In this work, this operation was realised by incorporating an "S"-crossover waveguide into the ring cavity {{in a manner that}} it introduces non reciprocal loss and gain in the counter-clockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW) directions respectively. The measured result showed higher quantum efficiency in the CW. In fact at 1. 5 times the threshold current, 90 % of the light was emitted in the favoured CW.
