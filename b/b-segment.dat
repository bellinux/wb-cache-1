25|$|The Renault Clio is a {{supermini}} car (<b>B-segment),</b> {{produced by}} the French automobile manufacturer Renault. It was launched in 1990, and was in its fourth generation in 2012. The Clio has had substantial critical and commercial success, being consistently one of Europe's top-selling cars since its launch, and it is largely credited with restoring Renault's reputation and stature after a difficult {{second half of the}} 1980s.

40|$|The {{growth of}} the {{segments}} A and B of mature embryos of pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) has been studied in vitro. The segments were 0, 5 — 0, 75 mm long. The segment A corresponded to {{the upper part of}} hypocotyl tissue with epicotyl and apical meristem, the segment B to {{the lower part of the}} hypocotyl, which was deprived of correlative relations. The experiments have given the following results: When submerged, the embryo segments did not show any signs of organogenesis and the increase of fresh and dry weight was considerably smaller than in segments which were cultivated on the surface of the medium. From three different nutrient media, which were used, (Heller’s Rob- bin’s and White’s) Heller’s medium was the most suitable one and caused the highest increase in fresh and dry weight of explants. However, the segment A was able to grow into a normal plant only on Murashige—Skoog medium. These facts are quite in agreement with our further investigations on the needs of pumpkin tissue for a basic medium rich in salts e. g. the MS-medium. When cultivated on the surface of a basic nutrient medium, say Heller’s medium, the segments differentiated into hypocotyls (the A- segments became 4 — 5 cm long, and the <b>B-segments</b> 0, 5 — 1 cm) and into weak roots (on the proximal side of segments). The application of IAA in high concentrations (10 - 5) induced roots also on the distal part of the segments, especially on <b>B-segments.</b> As a rule the roots were more vigorously developed in <b>B-segments.</b> The addition of coconut milk in concentration of 10 % stimulated the development of the hypocotyl, just as the addition of the IAA in a concentration of 10 % It is interesting that after a cultivation with adenine the A-segments were more vigorous than in the control. An addition of 0, 5 % yeast extract to the medium containing coconut milk also allowed a vigorous {{growth of the}} hypocotyl. In concentrations 10 - 6 and 10 - 5 the IAA increased the number of induced roots, disturbed the polarity of their formation and inhibited their elongation. High concentrations of growth stimulators, as e. g. 2, 4 -D (10 - 6 and 1 CT 5) or 2, 4, 5 -T (10 - 6 and 10 - 5) inhibited any organogenesis. The addition of 2, 4 -D (10 - 6) to the medium containing coconut milk, prevented the action of coconut milk so that the development of hypocotyl and roots was inhibited as compared to the growth of undifferentiated tissue which was slightlly stimulated. In concentrations of 10 - 8 and 10 % kinetin had a strong inhibitory effect on the development of hypocotyl even without any addition of other substances. At a concentration of 10 - 7 the kinetin enabled the development of the epicotyl with the apex. The addition of both kinetin and IAA (both in concentration 10 - 6) strongly inhibited the development of hypocotyl. In addition to the inhibition of the hypocotyl differentiation high concentrations of growth stimulators (e. g. 2, 4 -D) induced cell dedifferentiation and the appearance of cells of embryonic type, about 20 micro m in diameter...|$|R
40|$|Using Molecular Dynamics simulations, {{we study}} the force-induced {{detachment}} of a coarse-grained model polymer chain from an adhesive substrate. One {{of the chain}} ends is thereby pulled at constant speed off the attractive substrate and the resulting saw-tooth profile of the measured mean force vs height D of the end-segment over the plane is analyzed for a broad variety of parameters. It is shown that the observed characteristic oscillations in the -D profile depend on the bending {{and not on the}} torsional stiffness of the detached chains. Allowing for the presence of hydrodynamic interactions (HI) in a setup with explicit solvent and DPD-thermostat, rather than the case of Langevin thermostat, one finds that HI have little effect on the -D profile. Also the change of substrate affinity with respect to the solvent from solvophilic to solvophobic is found to play negligible role in the desorption process. In contrast, a changing ratio ϵ_s^A / ϵ_s^B of the binding energies of A- and <b>B-segments</b> in the detachment of an AB-copolymer from adhesive surface strongly changes the -D profile whereby the B-spikes vanish when ϵ_s^A / ϵ_s^B < 0. 15. Eventually, performing an atomistic simulation of a (bio) -polymer polyglycine, we demonstrate that the simulation results, derived from our coarse-grained model, comply favorably with those from the all-atom simulation.

40|$|Brassica napus {{introgression}} lines (ILs), having B-genome segments from B. carinata, {{were assessed}} genetically for extent of introgression and phenotypically for siliqua shatter resistance. Introgression lines had 7 - 9 % higher DNA content, were meiotically stable, and had almost normal pollen fertility/ seed set. Segment introgressions were confirmed by fluorescent genomic {{in situ hybridization}} (fl-GISH), SSR analyses, and SNP studies. Genotyping with 48 B-genome specific SSRs detected substitutions from B 3, B 4, B 6, and B 7 chromosomes on 39 of the 69 ILs whereas SNP genotyping detected a total of 23 <b>B-segments</b> (≥ 3 Mb) from B 4, B 6, and B 7 introgressed into 10 of the 19 (C 1, C 2, C 3, C 5, C 6, C 8, C 9, A 3, A 9, A 10) chromosomes in 17 ILs. The size of substitutions varied from 3. 0 Mb on chromosome A 9 (IL 59) to 42. 44 Mb on chromosome C 2 (IL 54), ranging from 7 to 83 % of the recipient chromosome. Average siliqua strength in ILs was observed {{to be higher than}} that of B. napus parents (2. 2 - 6. 0 vs. 1. 9 - 4. 0 mJ) while siliqua strength in some of the lines was almost equal to that of the donor parent B. carinata (6. 0 vs. 7. 2 mJ).
