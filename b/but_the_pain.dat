5|$|In 1975–76 Shero {{guided the}} Flyers to a 51–13–16 record {{highlighted}} by a 36–2–2 home ice record. Again {{they won the}} Patrick division and finished first overall in the Campbell Conference. The season saw the club set franchise records in points and winning percentage. The season also witnessed an exhibition game, that {{would become one of}} the most famous games in Flyers history. In 1976 the Soviet Red Army team toured North America and played four games against NHL clubs. On January 11, 1976, the Russians matched up against the Flyers at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. Entering the game the Red Army team was unbeaten, defeating both Boston and the Rangers and registering a tie against the Canadiens. Shero had studied the Soviet style of play, even traveling to the Soviet Union during different off-seasons. Shero even implemented some of the Russian style into his own system, altering it slightly. With his knowledge of the Russian system, Shero devised a game plan. The Russian system involved making several passes often to where a player had just moved from. Shero instructed the Flyers' players not to chase the puck, but rather hold their positions. While in the offensive zone the Flyer forwards were to hold the puck as much as possible to avoid counter-attacks. The Flyers won the game by a final of 4–1 and outshot the Red Army 49–13. The victory led some to see the Flyers as the best team in the world. Following the playoffs that distinction would not last. Bernie Parent had suffered a back injury that limited him to eleven regular season games; he was able to return for the first-round series win versus Toronto. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> became too much for Parent to continue to play in subsequent series, and Shero was forced to use his back-up goaltender, Wayne Stephenson. The Flyers were also without second-line centre MacLeish, resulting in a depletion of scoring depth. Despite these setbacks Shero led Philadelphia past Boston in the semi-finals and back to the Stanley Cup Finals. However, the Flyers fell short of winning three straight cups, losing to Montreal in four consecutive games.|$|E
25|$|The {{two basic}} types of {{sensation}} are touch-position and pain-temperature. Touch-position input comes to attention immediately, but pain-temperature input reaches {{the level of}} consciousness after a delay; when a person steps on a pin, the awareness of stepping on something is immediate <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> associated with it is delayed.|$|E
25|$|The present {{understanding}} {{of pain in}} babies {{is largely due to}} the recognition that the fetal and newborn unmyelinated nerve fibres are capable of relaying information, albeit slower than would be the case with myelinated fibres. At birth a baby has developed the neural pathways for nociception and for experiencing pain, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> responses are an immature version of that of an adult. There are a number of differences in both nerve structure and in the quality and extent of nerve response which are considered to be pertinent to understanding neonatal pain.|$|E

500|$|Returning in the episode, [...] "The Butterfly Effect", {{following}} her failure to stop Sylar, Elle seeks assistance from Noah Bennet. He is detained in Level 5, a high security ward for the Company's most dangerous prisoners. However, Sylar is already there, having killed her father. He attempts {{to take her}} ability, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> of being scalped causes her to involuntarily release a massive electrical surge. This knocks Sylar out, but also disables security for the entire facility, allowing the prisoners to escape. Elle is later fired by Angela Petrelli, {{the new head of}} the Company, who tells Elle that the only reason the Company kept her was because of her father's influence.|$|E
500|$|Pulp {{sensitivity}} tests, usually {{carried out}} with a cotton wool [...] sprayed with ethyl chloride {{to serve as a}} cold stimulus, or with an electric pulp tester. The air spray from a three-in-one syringe may also be used to demonstrate areas of dentin hypersensitivity. Heat tests can also be applied with hot Gutta-percha. [...] A healthy tooth will feel the cold <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> will be mild and disappear once the stimulus is removed. [...] The accuracy of these tests has been reported as 86% for cold testing, 81% for electric pulp testing, and 71% for heat testing. [...] Because of the lack of test sensitivity, a second symptom should be present or a positive test before making a diagnosis.|$|E
500|$|As the Battle of Churubusco approached, Scott ordered Pierce to {{the rear}} to convalesce. He responded, [...] "For God's sake, General, {{this is the last}} great battle, and I must lead my brigade." [...] Scott yielded, and Pierce entered the fight tied to his saddle, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> in his leg became so great that he passed out on the field. The Americans won the battle and Pierce helped {{negotiate}} an armistice. He then returned to command and led his brigade {{throughout the rest of the}} campaign, eventually taking part in the capture of Mexico City in mid-September, although his brigade was held in reserve for much of the battle. He spent much of Mexico City fight in the sick tent, plagued with acute diarrhea. Pierce remained in command of his brigade during the three-month occupation of the city, while frustrated with the stalling of peace negotiations, and tried to distance himself from the constant conflict between Scott and the other generals.|$|E

50|$|Relief of <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> of angina is of {{paramount}} importance, {{not only for}} humane reasons <b>but</b> because <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> is associated with sympathetic activation that causes vasoconstriction and increases the workload of <b>the</b> heart. <b>The</b> <b>pain</b> of myocardial ischemia is likely to respond to any intervention that improves the relationship between oxygen demand and supply, like nitrates, beta blockers and oxygen.|$|R

500|$|Khan collaborated for {{the third}} time with Aditya Chopra on the romantic drama Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008) {{opposite}} Anushka Sharma, at that time a newcomer. He played Surinder Sahni, a shy man with low self-esteem, whose love for his young arranged wife (Sharma) causes him to transform himself into Raj, a boisterous alter-ego. Rachel Saltz of The New York Times believed the dual role to have been [...] "tailor-made" [...] for Khan, giving him the opportunity to display his talents, although Deep Contractor from Epilogue thought Khan displayed greater strength in the role of Surinder and weakness in the role of monologue-prone Raj. In December 2008, Khan suffered a shoulder injury while filming a small role in Mudassar Aziz's Dulha Mil Gaya. He underwent extensive physiotherapy sessions at the time <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> left him almost immobile and he had arthroscopic surgery in February 2009. He performed an extended, special appearance in the 2009 film Billu, playing Bollywood superstar Sahir Khana fictionalised version of himself, wherein he performed musical item numbers with actresses Kareena Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, and Deepika Padukone. As head of the film's production company, Red Chillies, Khan made the call to change the title of the film from Billu Barber to Billu after hairdressers across the country complained that the word [...] "barber" [...] was derogatory. The company covered up the offending word on billboards that had already been installed with the original title.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1900s Nicolae Minovici, a {{professor}} of forensic science in Bucharest, undertook a series of experiments into hanging. [...] At first he put the noose around his neck while lying down and had an assistant put tension on the rope. [...] He {{then moved on to}} full suspension by the neck. [...] Finally, he attempted suspension with a slipping hangman's knot, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> was too great for him to continue. [...] He could not swallow for a month. [...] Minovici was determined to surpass a record set by Dr. Fleichmann of Erlangen, who in 1832, self-asphyxiated for two minutes. [...] However, Minovici could not get close to this and disbelieved Fleichmann.|$|E
2500|$|The {{only person}} {{to survive the}} crash was Paul Olsen, {{one of the two}} radio operators. He was sitting in the aircraft's rear in one of the Catalina's side blisters. Upon impact he was ejected [...] from the aircraft. Olsen stated that he did not recall {{anything}} from the accident and that he initially was unconscious. After waking up he tried calling to the other crew members. He then tried to walk around, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> in his foot made this impossible. The aircraft was still on fire and he dared not approach it. Because of the aircraft's poor insulation, Olsen was wearing a leather jacket and a sheepskin sweater, which kept him warm until he was rescued.|$|E
60|$|Unwounded, the boma and {{the flames}} might have turned him back; <b>but</b> now <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> and <b>the</b> rage wiped caution from his mind, {{and with a}} loud, and angry roar he topped the barrier with an easy leap and was among the horses.|$|R

5000|$|Officer Cooper {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "the pained heart of the series.
