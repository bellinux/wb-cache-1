However, the epidemic struck the city soon after; Betances' stepmother and one of his brothers-in-law would die from it.

Motley was the AAFC's third-leading rusher, with 889 yards, and Gillom came in second in punting average, with 44.6 yards. Speedie, Lou Rymkus, Graham and Motley were chosen unanimously by sportswriters for an all-AAFC team. Lavelli and Bill Willis were also selected <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> writers. Graham and Speedie were named first-team selections when the Associated Press put together a combined AAFC and NFL All-Pro list.|$|E

In some cases the windows were impossible to repair, and clear glass was eventually introduced to replace the missing scenes.

At least two governors of New York lived in buildings facing Washington Park outside of their term in office. Due to the historical and architectural significance of the park and neighborhood both were included in 1972 as the Washington Park Historic District; and in 1998 the park was named one of the nation's 100 most important parks by the American Association of Architects. In 2008 Boston-based composer Peter Child wrote an orchestral piece inspired by the park, entitled Washington Park.|$|E

Henry remained in Normandy and took up a role within Robert's court, possibly either because he was unwilling to openly side with William Rufus, or because Robert might have taken the opportunity to confiscate Henry's inherited money if {{he had tried to}} leave.
