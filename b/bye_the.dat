Not only did {{they have a new}} head coach, but also thirteen new players in their squad. This all contributed to them finishing the season ninth that season. The Highlanders' 2005 season started with a loss to the Blues at Carisbrook. Following this the side won six games consecutively, the first time the franchise had ever done so. After a draw with the Stormers and a <b>bye,</b> <b>the</b> Highlanders had gone unbeaten for eight weeks.

5|$|The Highlander’s 2005 season {{started with}} only their second ever {{loss to the}} Blues at Carisbrook, a 3014 loss. Following this the side won six games consecutively, {{the first time the}} {{franchise}} had ever done so. They first defeated the Bulls 230, then the Sharks 437. They then won away against the Cats and Reds. They returned to Carisbrook and defeated the Brumbies 1918, and the following week won in Wellington {{for the first time with}} a 2616 win over the Hurricanes. After a draw with the Stormers and a <b>bye,</b> <b>the</b> Highlanders had gone unbeaten for eight weeks.

5|$|Parcells signed Patriots {{running back}} Curtis Martin as a {{restricted}} free agent, giving up 1st- and 3rd-round picks. Parcells also signed Baltimore Ravens quarterback Vinny Testaverde {{as a free}} agent, which {{paved the way for}} O'Donnell's release from the team. After an 0–2 start, New York won six of the next seven games. The Jets lost only once the rest of the way, and clinched their first NFL division crown against the Bills on December 19, 1998. They set a franchise record for the number of victories in a season with a win over the Patriots in the season finale. The team finished 12–4 and were second seed in the playoffs with a first round <b>bye.</b> <b>The</b> Jets faced the Jacksonville Jaguars in their divisional playoff game, their first home playoff game since the 1986 season. New York defeated the Jaguars 34–24 and met the top-seeded Broncos in the AFC Championship Game. Though the Jets possessed a 10–0 lead in the 3rd quarter, the Broncos, led by John Elway in his final home game, came back and defeated the Jets, 23–10.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 {{was one of}} two {{contrasting}} halves for the Highlanders. The {{team won}} their first four matches — against the Chiefs, Crusaders, Waratahs, and Hurricanes. By that point the Highlanders were {{on the top of the}} table, but lost the position after losing to the Brumbies in Canberra. After a win over the Rebels, loss to the Stormers, and a <b>bye,</b> <b>the</b> Highlanders defeated the Blues 30–27 in Dunedin. They narrowly defeated the Cheetahs in Bloemfontein in round 10; they then stood fifth in the table. The team went on to lose five of their seven remaining matches, and slip to ninth on the table after the end of the regular season. Despite winning more matches than in 2011, the Highlanders finished fourth in the New Zealand conference — with only the Blues below them.|$|E
5|$|The 2014 {{season was}} a more {{successful}} season, with the Crusaders making a Grand Final appearance. The Crusaders made the playoffs {{with a record of}} 11 wins and 5 losses. For the second time the Crusaders won the New Zealand Conference, as a result, they earned a first round <b>bye.</b> <b>The</b> Crusaders then defeated the Sharks 38-6 in the semi-final. In the Grand Final against the Waratahs played in Sydney, the Crusaders fell short by 32-33. The Waratahs started strong with a 14-0 early lead before the Crusaders hit back, entering halftime down 13-20. In the 76th minute Colin Slade got his sixth penalty to put the Crusaders up 32-30, looking to steal the game at the end. However, Craig Joubert awarded a controversial penalty in the 78th minute to the Waratahs. Bernard Foley calmly made the championship winning kick, ensuring a 33-32 Waratahs victory. The following day Joubert contacted both Crusaders Coach Todd Blackadder and Crusaders Captain Richie McCaw to apologise, announcing to both that he got the final call wrong.|$|E

5|$|To {{secure a}} first round <b>bye,</b> <b>the</b> Giants needed to beat {{two of the}} NFL's worst teams, the Phoenix Cardinals and New England Patriots on the road. The Giants won the Cardiinals game 24–21. Their game against the Patriots was a de facto home game, as many Giants fans made the trip up to Foxborough to sell the stadium out. The Patriots, who came in 1-14 and on a 13-game losing streak in a scandal-plagued season, played the Giants better than expected, but missed a field goal that proved the {{difference}} as the Giants held on for a 13-10 win. The win secured a 13-3 record, and the playoff bye as the NFC's second seed. The team discipline Parcells installed was exemplified by the Giants setting the record for fewest turnovers in a season with 14 (this is still the NFL record as of 2007).|$|E
5|$|Davidson was {{in strong}} all round {{form in the}} 1961–62 Australian season, which was a purely {{domestic}} one. Against Victoria in Sydney, he scored 106 in a hard hitting innings with the tail. He made 58 of the 59runs added in a last wicket partnership with Doug Ford, the other being a leg <b>bye.</b> <b>The</b> partnership lasted only 44 balls and Davidson managed to farm the strike and face 41 of these. The effort helped {{to set up a}} ten-wicket win. The following week against Western Australia in Perth, he made 108 after New South Wales had slumped to 6/38 to help the visitors recover to 218. New South Wales struggled in their second innings and Western Australia needed only 175 for victory. However, Davidson took his career best innings bowling figures of 7/31 to bowl out the hosts for 106 and seize a victory. In both matches against Queensland, Davidson took four quick wickets in the second innings to secure narrow victories after bold declarations. New South Wales won the Shield in that season with 64 of a maximum possible 80 points, playing aggressive cricket under Benaud. It was their ninth title in a row. Davidson was a key factor in the dominance, scoring 521runs at 40.07 and taking 42 wickets at 13.62.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 {{season was}} the Steelers' seventh {{as members of}} the AFC North Division. Pittsburgh defended their {{division}} title from the 2007 season, which they obtained by tying the Cleveland Browns' 10–6 record, but holding the tie-breaker with two wins over the Browns. Through 2008, Pittsburgh is the only team to have won the AFC North four times, since its inception prior to the 2002 NFL season. Entering the 2008 season, the Steelers were chosen to win the division by sportswriter Ron Borges, as well as nine of 13 analysts interviewed by ESPN.com. Four NFL.com analysts predicted that the Steelers would finish with a 10–6 record. The Steelers finished the regular season with a record of 12–4, going undefeated against opponents in the AFC North and winning 12games for the fourth season since 1979. The team clinched the second seed in the AFC for the playoffs and received a <b>bye</b> <b>the</b> first week of the post-season. The Baltimore Ravens finished at second place in the AFC North with an 11–5 record, clinching a playoff seed as an AFC wild card. The Cincinnati Bengals finished 4–11–1, winning their final three games of the season. The Cleveland Browns finished in the AFC North's fourth position at 4–12; the team fired head coach Romeo Crennel after the season.|$|E

5000|$|In a bye-stand Mitchell, {{there are}} two {{modifications}} needed to the basic table setup. First, table 1 must be set up near the highest numbered table, because throughout the game, those two tables will share boards—after playing a board at one table it must be passed to the other to play. Second, a [...] "bye stand" [...] or [...] "relay table" [...] must be set up halfway {{between the first and}} last tables—for example, in an eight-table movement, <b>the</b> <b>bye</b> stand must be set up between tables 4 and 5. When moving boards after each round, boards at the table just above <b>the</b> <b>bye</b> stand go to <b>the</b> <b>bye</b> stand; <b>the</b> boards on <b>the</b> <b>bye</b> stand go to the table just below <b>the</b> <b>bye</b> stand. In <b>the</b> eight-table example, boards go from table 5 to <b>the</b> <b>bye</b> stand, and from <b>the</b> <b>bye</b> stand to table 4. This movement allows all pairs to play all boards, but the drawbacks are that the sharing of boards between two tables tends to slow down the movement, mistakes can be made with both <b>the</b> <b>bye</b> stand placement and the movement of boards to <b>the</b> <b>bye</b> stand, and late pairs are harder to accommodate.|$|R

It was the 17th and final meeting between Brady and his rival Peyton Manning, as Manning would announce his retirement after the season ended. The Broncos' top-ranked defense harassed Brady, who completed 27-of-56 passes with two interceptions and a touchdown, all day, and the Patriots eventually lost the game 20–18 after a potential game-tying two-point conversion attempt failed with 17 seconds left in regulation.|$|E
25|$|The Super Bowl is {{currently}} {{played on the}} first Sunday in February. This {{is due to the}} NFL current schedule which consists of the opening weekend of the season being held immediately after Labor Day (the first Monday in September), the 17-week regular season (where teams each play 16 games and have one <b>bye),</b> <b>the</b> first three rounds of the playoffs, and the Super Bowl two weeks after the two Conference Championship Games. This schedule has been in effect since Super Bowl XXXVIII in February 2004. The date of the Super Bowl can thus be determined from the date of the preceding Labor Day. For example, Labor Day in 2015 occurred on September 7; therefore the next Super Bowl was scheduled exactly five months later on February 7, 2016.|$|E
