5|$|Emilio del Guercio {{said that}} the toy arrow {{represents}} absurdity and the teardrop sentimentality and melancholy.

5|$|After this tournament, the gambit {{finally began}} to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>seriously.</b> Top players like Savielly Tartakower and Siegbert Tarrasch started to play it. Schlechter {{published}} in 1918 the monograph Die budapester Verteidigung des Damengambits, which can be considered the first book on this opening. The gambit reached its peak of popularity (around five Budapest Gambits for every thousand games played) around 1920, {{so much so that}} many White players adopted the move-order 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 to avoid it.|$|E
5|$|Since their {{creation}} in 1995, awards {{have been given}} in various categories of speculative fiction. Categories currently include science fiction, fantasy, horror, speculative young adult fiction—with separate awards for novels and short fiction—collections, anthologies, illustrative works or graphic novels, children's books, and an award for excellence in speculative fiction. The awards have {{attracted the attention of}} publishers by setting down a benchmark in science fiction and fantasy. The continued sponsorship by publishers such as HarperCollins and Orbit has identified the award as an honour to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>seriously.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{moderate}} {{sales of}} their debut album Cheshire Cat (1995), released on independent record label Cargo Music, Blink-182 enjoyed {{a small amount}} of success. Throughout 1994 and 1995, the trio vigorously toured nonstop and grew in popularity, mostly in Australia, where audiences embraced the band's irreverent sense of humor and stage shows. When the trio grew frustrated when fans lamented the inability to purchase Cheshire Cat at their respective local record stores, they began to turn toward other record labels to achieve wider distribution than Cargo. By the end of 1995, problems had become apparent between the trio and the label, who regarded the band as a joke not to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>seriously.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{he was a}} {{newcomer}} to the Castro District, Milk had shown leadership in the small community. He was starting to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>seriously</b> as a candidate and decided to run again for supervisor in 1975. He reconsidered his approach and cut his long hair, swore off marijuana, and vowed never to visit another gay bathhouse again. Milk's campaigning earned {{the support of the}} teamsters, firefighters, and construction unions. Castro Camera became the center of activity in the neighborhood. Milk would often pull people off the street to work his campaigns for him—many discovered later that they just happened to be the type of men Milk found attractive.|$|E
5|$|In England, the seventh-century bishop Aldhelm was {{the most}} {{influential}} hermeneutic writer; Latin scholarship declined in the ninth century, and when it revived in the tenth, the hermeneutic style became increasingly influential. Unlike in continental Europe, where it was used only by a minority of writers, in tenth-century England it became nearly universal. It was the house style of the English Benedictine Reform, the most important intellectual movement in later Anglo-Saxon England. The style fell out of favour after the Norman Conquest, and the twelfth-century chronicler William of Malmesbury described it as disgusting and bombastic. Historians were equally dismissive until the late twentieth century, when scholars such as Michael Lapidge argued that it should <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>seriously</b> as {{an important aspect of}} late Anglo-Saxon culture.|$|E

5|$|Kilmer is {{considered}} among {{the last of the}} Romantic era poets because his verse is conservative and traditional in style and does not break any of the formal rules of poetics—a style often criticized today for being too sentimental to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>seriously.</b> The entire corpus of Kilmer's work was produced between 1909 and 1918 when Romanticism and sentimental lyric poetry fell out of favor and Modernism took root—especially with the influence of the Lost Generation. In the years after Kilmer's death, poetry went in drastically different directions, as is seen in the work of T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, and academic criticism grew with it to eschew the more sentimental and straightforward verse.|$|E
5|$|The Kaluza–Klein {{theory and}} {{subsequent}} attempts by Einstein to develop unified field theory were never completely successful. In part {{this was because}} Kaluza–Klein theory predicted a particle {{that has never been}} shown to exist, and in part because it was unable to correctly predict the ratio of an electron's mass to its charge. In addition, these theories were being developed just as other physicists were beginning to discover quantum mechanics, which would ultimately prove successful in describing known forces such as electromagnetism, as well as new nuclear forces that were being discovered throughout the middle part of the century. Thus it would take almost fifty years for the idea of new dimensions to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>seriously</b> again.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{corpus of}} Kilmer's work was {{produced}} between 1909 and 1918 when Romanticism and sentimental lyric poetry {{fell out of}} favor and Modernism took root—especially with {{the influence of the}} Lost Generation. In the years after Kilmer's death, poetry went in drastically different directions, as is seen especially in the work of T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. Kilmer's verse is conservative and traditional, and does not break the formal rules of poetics—he can be considered as one of the last poets of the Romantic era. His style has been criticized for not breaking free of traditional modes of rhyme, meter, and theme, and for being too sentimental to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>seriously.</b>|$|E

5|$|The book aroused {{international}} interest and a widespread debate, with no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological, social and religious implications. Much {{of the initial}} reaction was hostile, in a large part because very few reviewers actually understood his theory, but Darwin had to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>seriously</b> as a prominent and respected name in science. There was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication Vestiges of Creation, which had been rejected by scientists, but had influenced a wide public readership into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws. The Origin of Species as a book of wide general interest became associated with ideas of social reform. Its proponents made full use of a surge in the publication of review journals, and it was given more popular attention {{than almost any other}} scientific work, though it failed to match the continuing sales of Vestiges. Darwin's book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms, and the newly coined term Darwinism was used to cover the whole range of evolutionism, not just his own ideas. By the mid-1870s, evolutionism was triumphant.|$|E
5|$|The most {{influential}} retelling, {{which according to}} many commentators ensured that the Mary Celeste affair would never be forgotten, was {{a story in the}} January 1884 issue of the Cornhill Magazine. This was an early work of Arthur Conan Doyle, then a 25-year-old ship's surgeon. Doyle's story, entitled J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement, did not adhere to the facts. He renamed the ship Marie Celeste, the captain's name was J. W. Tibbs, the fatal voyage took place in 1873 and was from Boston to Lisbon. The vessel carried passengers, among them the titular Jephson. In the story, another passenger, a fanatic named Septimus Goring with a hatred of the white race, has suborned members of the crew to murder Tibbs and take the vessel to the shores of Western Africa. Here, the rest of the ship's company is killed, save for Jephson who is spared because he possesses a magical charm that is venerated by Goring and his accomplices. Doyle had not expected his story to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>seriously,</b> but Sprague, still serving as the US consul in Gibraltar, was sufficiently intrigued to inquire if any part of the story might be true.|$|E

25|$|These snakes are venomous, but {{possess a}} weaker venom {{than many other}} rattlesnakes. This, {{together}} with the smaller size of their venom glands, makes them less dangerous than their larger relatives. Still, any rattlesnake bite can be fatal and should <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>seriously</b> and medical attention sought immediately.|$|E
25|$|Scott was {{executed}} by a firing squad on March 4, 1870. Historians have debated Riel's motivations for allowing the execution, as they consider it his one great political blunder. His own justification {{was that he}} {{felt it necessary to}} demonstrate to the Canadians that the Métis must <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>seriously.</b>|$|E

25|$|DMK's slogan of Dravida Nadu {{found no}} support {{in any state}} of India other than Tamil Nadu. The non-Tamil Dravidian {{speakers}} perceived the ambitions of the Tamil politicians as hegemonic, ultimately leading {{to the failure of}} the Dravida Nadu concept. C. Rajagopalachari, the former Chief Minister of Madras State and a Tamil Brahmin, stated that the DMK plea for Dravida Nadu should not <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>seriously.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some cranks lack {{academic}} achievement, {{in which}} case they typically assert that academic training in the subject of their crank belief is not only unnecessary for discovering the truth, but actively harmful because they believe it poisons the minds by teaching falsehoods. Others greatly exaggerate their personal achievements, and may insist that some achievement (real or alleged) in some entirely unrelated area of human endeavor implies that their cranky opinion should <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>seriously.</b>|$|E
