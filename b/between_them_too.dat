60|$|They {{sat down}} and began to talk times and terms. They parted with a perfect understanding, and Maxwell was almost as much deceived as the actor himself. He went home full of gay hopes to begin work on the play at once, and to realize the {{character}} of Haxard with {{the personality of the}} actor in his eye. He heard nothing from him till the following spring, when the actor wrote with all the ardor of their parting moment, {{to say that he was}} coming East for the summer, and meant to settle down in the region of Boston somewhere, so that they could meet constantly and make the play what they both wanted. He said nothing to account for his long silence, and he seemed so little aware of it that Maxwell might very well have taken it for a simple fidelity to the understanding <b>between</b> <b>them,</b> <b>too</b> unconscious to protest itself. He answered discreetly, and said that he expected to pass the summer on the coast somewhere, but was not yet quite certain where he should be; that he had not forgotten their interview, and should still be glad to let him have the play if he fancied it. Between this time and the time when the actor appeared in person, he sent Maxwell several short notes, and two or three telegrams, sufficiently relevant but not very necessary, and when his engagement ended in the West, a fortnight after Maxwell was married, he telegraphed again and then came through without a stop from Denver, where the combination broke up, to Manchester-by-the-Sea. He joined the little colony of actors which summers there, and began to play tennis and golf, and to fish and to sail, almost without a moment's delay. He was not very fond of any of these things, and in fact he was fond only of one thing in the world, which was the stage; but he had a theory that they were recreation, and that if he went in for them he was building himself up for the season, which began early in September; he had appropriate costumes for all of them, and no one dressed the part more perfectly in tennis or golf or sailing or fishing. He believed that he ought to read up in the summer, too, and he had the very best of the recent books, in fiction and criticism, and the new drama. He had all of the translations of Ibsen, and several of Mæterlinck's plays in French; he read a good deal in his books, and he lent them about in the hotel even more. Among the ladies there he had the repute of a very modern intellect, and of a person you would never take for an actor, from his tastes. What his tastes would have been if you had taken him for an actor, they could not have said, perhaps, but probably something vicious, and he had not a vice. He did not smoke, and he did not so much as drink tea or coffee; he had cocoa for breakfast, and at lunch a glass of milk, with water at dinner. He had a tint like the rose, and when he smiled or laughed, which was often, from a constitutional amiability and a perfect digestion, his teeth showed white and regular, and an innocent dimple punctured either cheek. His name was Godolphin, for he had instinctively felt that in choosing a name he might as well take a handsome one while he was about it, and that if he became Godolphin there was no reason why he should not become Launcelot, too. He did not put on these splendors from any foible, but from a professional sense of their value in the bills; and he was not personally characterized by them. As Launcelot Godolphin he was simpler than he would have been with a simpler name, and it was his ideal to be modest in everything that personally belonged to him. He studied an unprofessional walk, and a very colloquial tone in speaking. He was of course clean-shaven, but during the summer he let his mustache grow, though he was aware that he looked better without it. He was tall, and he carried himself with the vigor of his perfect health; but on the stage he looked less than his real size, like a perfectly proportioned edifice.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{theories}} {{about the origin of}} stammering. But we can classify them into three groups. Primarily, as a deformity of peripheral phonetic organs. Socondly, as disorders of central nerve systems. Thirdly, as a problem of mental disturbance resulting from phonetic failure. Studying into the various aspects of stammering, we find that there are many resemblances between Psychoneuroses and it. In spite of this, there are some different phases <b>between</b> <b>them,</b> <b>too.</b> ⅰ. Psychoneuroses appear generally after the adult age of people. But, stammering presents itself from the beginning of childfood. ⅱ. Stammering is hardly to be cured by the method of psychological therapy.

Although the influence of the teacher to the pupil cannot be denied, there are plenty of disagreements <b>between</b> <b>them,</b> <b>too.</b> Among such disagreements, particularly interesting for me is the opposition between them concerning the correct part-whole structure of the phenomenon called judgment. And the aim of this paper is to examine the nature and possible source of that opposition. I proceed as follows. First, I explain the opposition at issue (1). Next, I present an objection to Brentano's view from the side of Husserl (2). Then, I consider the question of how Brentano could maintain his view despite the obviousness of the objection, and suggest that the opposition concerning the structure of judgment can be understood as stemming from a general mereological opposition between mereological actualism and potentialism (3) ...|$|E

30|$|When {{assessing}} reproducibility {{one must}} be aware of the components contributing to the variability. The tables and figures concentrate on the variability within and between the two assessors. In fact the pairs of lesions analysed in each case are not the same image of the lesion but two different images of the same lesion taken at different times (albeit the same operation). Thus the within-subject variation is not only a function of the variability of the assessor but also the variability of the image taken. Whilst efforts have been made to minimise the variability between the images, inevitably the photographs will not be taken at exactly the same angle, the needle will not be in exactly the same position for each photograph, and other variables will be slightly different <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>too.</b> It is important to be aware of these differences, as {{they are likely to be}} minimised in this study by the fact that the images were captured during the same operation a short duration apart. In studies assessing the efficacy of a treatment over time, the images will be captured during separate operations some time apart, almost certainly increasing the variability.|$|E
30|$|Although {{there are}} {{specialized}} grippers for assembling o-rings [17], {{as far as}} we know, there is no work discussing the assembly of deformable ring-shaped objects by a dual-arm robot focusing on minimizing the deformation of the object. Using a dual-arm robot does not limit the type of tasks that can be achieved, thus representing a cheaper solution than specialized machines that can only insert o-rings. In addition, focusing on the object’s deformation is very important, since the main role of o-rings is to seal pipes against liquids and gases, which is why the o-ring diameter is smaller than that of the pipe/tube it is inserted in (like this the o-ring exerts pressure on the pipe/tube leaving no gap <b>between</b> <b>them).</b> <b>Too</b> much deformation can permanently change the size of the object leading to undesired gaps between the object and the pipe/tube, or can deteriorate the object leading to a reduced life span. For these reasons in this work we proposed a combination of human demonstration (leverage the burden of planning complex tasks) with an optimization-based planning (minimize the object’s deformation) for inserting ring-shaped objects.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{philosophical}} researches {{pay attention}} to various aspects of self-knowledge investigation. For instance, there are works on historical concepts of self-knowledge (e. g. ones by C. Moore), or articles about the place of self-knowledge in the phenomenon of rationality (e. g. ones by J. Roessler), or articles about epistemological lacks of self-knowledge (e. g. ones by J. Fernández). However, our paper is about the aspect {{that is not in}} the researchers’ centre of attention. Our study shows that practicing of book reading can be a source of information not only about the content of the books, but also about their readers. We investigate a phenomenon of incompatible interpretations, Ludwig Wittgenstein’s ideas about understanding his texts, Merab Mamardashvili’s concept of ‘novel as a machine’, Ludwig Feuerbach’s theory of specifics of human cognition, and Philosophical Hermeneutics thinkers’ concepts about problems of understanding. The purpose of our paper is to describe possibilities of getting self-knowledge by analyzing the information about the results of philosophical texts reading. The research holds that these results give information about the content of the text as well as a reader’s ideas. A reader can use word forms from the texts to express his own implicit thoughts. Philosophical texts are the most effective tool for doing that because their content and ways of text organization stimulate such an activity. We illustrate these statements by examples from history of philosophy. For instance, we investigate the creation of the theory on the genealogy of morality by Friedrich Nietzsche. Analyzing phrases, which were important for him in the text, a person can estimate his own ideas. If one uses this theoretical model for getting self-knowledge he takes a new source of information about his own implicit ideas. The interpretation of this information will be effective. As a result of analyzing of Friedrich Schleiermacher, Hans-Georg Gadamer and Martin Heidegger’s theories we state that the interpretation of somebody’s own ideas does not make big problems with taking into account factors that have influenced the process of thoughts formation and context of creating ideas. We show how this approach to interpretation of reading philosophical text diverges from the other ones. Moreover, we argue that there is a relation of our theoretical model to Socratic maieutics, although we describe differences <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>too...</b>|$|E
