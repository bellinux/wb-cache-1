5|$|In 2004, Gabi Ben Harosh, {{partner of}} the Abergil brothers, was arrested in Los Angeles. After two years of house arrest, he signed a plea <b>bargain</b> <b>for</b> minor offenses, {{connected}} to bringing in foreign currency without a permit, {{and was sentenced to}} community service and judicial supervision for three years. In view of the Abergil brothers extradition to the US, {{he and his wife were}} arrested for violating immigration laws. It is believed that American authorities tried to apply pressure to Ben Harosh to incriminate the Abergil brothers but failed.|$|E
5|$|Davis is acquitted, but Freamon {{uses the}} threat of federal {{prosecution}} to blackmail him for information. Davis reveals Maurice Levy has a mole in the courthouse from whom he illegally purchases copies of sealed indictments. Herc tells Levy that the Stanfield case was probably based on an illegal wiretap, something which would jeopardize the entire case. After Levy reveals this to Pearlman, she uses Levy's espionage to blackmail him into agreeing to a plea <b>bargain</b> <b>for</b> his defendants. Levy ensures Stanfield's release {{on the condition that}} he permanently retires, while his subordinates will have to accept long sentences. Stanfield sells the connection to The Greeks back to the Co-Op and plans to become a businessman, although he appears unable or unwilling to stay off the corner.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, Marston {{sides with}} Mexican Army Colonel Agustín Allende (Gary Carlos Cervantes) and his {{right-hand}} man Captain Vincente de Santa (Hector Luis Bustamante), to help end a rebellion {{in return for}} Allende delivering Escuella and Williamson to him. However, Allende betrays Marston, who then sides with the rebels. With the initial help of elderly gunslinger Landon Ricketts (Ross Hagen), Marston, along with rebel leader Abraham Reyes (Josh Segarra) {{and one of his}} lovers Luisa (Francesca Galeas), eventually turns the tide in favour of the rebels, killing de Santa and launching an assault on the El Presidio fortress. They find Escuella, who attempts to <b>bargain</b> <b>for</b> his life by revealing that Williamson has been under Allende's protection. Marston is given the option to either kill Escuella or turn him over to the Bureau. Marston and Reyes then take the fight to Allende, where Luisa is killed during the attack. As Allende's palace is stormed by the rebels, both he and Williamson flee, but are apprehended and executed. Reyes then takes charge of the local government and plans to advance on the capital, while Marston leaves to meet with the Bureau in Blackwater.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{not wanting}} Rufus' {{betrayal}} become known, the President orders the Turks' destruction. Despite this imminent threat, the Turks manage to find two more Support Materia. Under Fuhito's control, {{the remainder of}} AVALANCHE is turned into a vicious army of uncontrollable Ravens, and he manages to steal all the materia needed. In the final battle, Fuhito summons Zirconiade, fusing the summon with his own body, and Shears sacrifices himself to save Elfé. Fuhito transforms into a monster, but he is defeated by the Turks. After the battle, Tseng falsely claims that both Veld and Elfé are dead, so as {{to protect them from}} being hunted by Shinra. The Turks are then reorganized, with Tseng reinstated as their immediate leader, but they are now sworn to loyalty to Shinra as part of the <b>bargain</b> <b>for</b> their survival. The original Turks find new lives for themselves in hiding, and are later seen helping in the evacuation of Midgar during the events of VII.|$|E
5|$|No single motive or {{pattern has}} emerged through the {{thousands}} of pages of evidence gathered. The selection of works puzzles the experts, specifically since more valuable artworks were available. The FBI's lead agent assigned to the case, Geoffrey J. Kelly, finds it difficult to understand why this assortment of items was stolen despite the thieves being in the museum for enough time to take whatever they wished. On their way to the finial, the thieves passed by two Raphaels and a Botticelli painting. Titian's The Rape of Europa, {{which is one of the}} museum's most well-known and valuable pieces, was not stolen. Due to the brutish ways the criminals handled the robbery, cutting the painting from their frames and smashing frames for two Degas sketches, investigators believe the thieves were amateur criminals, not experts commissioned to steal particular works. Some investigators believe the works were destroyed, explaining why they have not reappeared. Theories on the theft include that it was organized by the Irish Republican Army in order to raise money or <b>bargain</b> <b>for</b> the release of imprisoned comrades. Another theory states Whitey Bulger was the ringleader of the theft. At the time of the heist, he was Boston's top crime boss and an FBI informant.|$|E
5|$|Taft {{continued}} and expanded Roosevelt's efforts {{to break up}} business combinations through lawsuits brought under the Sherman Antitrust Act, bringing 70 cases in four years (Roosevelt had brought 40 in seven years). Suits brought against the Standard Oil Company and the American Tobacco Company, initiated under Roosevelt, were decided {{in favor of the}} government by the Supreme Court in 1911. In June 1911, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives began hearings into United States Steel (U.S. Steel). That company had been expanded under Roosevelt, who had supported its acquisition of the Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company as a means of preventing the deepening of the Panic of 1907, a decision the former president defended when testifying at the hearings. Taft, as Secretary of War, had praised the acquisitions. Historian Louis L. Gould suggested that Roosevelt was likely deceived into believing that U.S. Steel did not want to purchase the Tennessee company, but it was in fact a <b>bargain.</b> <b>For</b> Roosevelt, questioning the matter went to his personal honesty.|$|E

25|$|Initially, {{investigators}} believed, if Donati {{had planned}} the Gardner theft {{it was to}} settle a gambling debt owed by a former security guard at the museum, who told him how lax the security was. Kurkjian offered another explanation for why Donati robbed the museum: he felt unsafe on the streets as long as Ferrara remained in custody, and hoped to use the art to <b>bargain</b> <b>for</b> his freedom, as Connor had done to reduce his sentence by arranging {{for the return of}} the BMFA's Rembrandt 15 years earlier.|$|E

From them, Menéndez de Avilés learned of Alonso de Olmos' survival and was able to secure the boy's return. After gaining a fuller picture of the massacre from Olmos, Menéndez de Avilés attempted to use other natives as hostages to <b>bargain</b> <b>for</b> the hand-over of Don Luís.

25|$|The freedmen, {{with the}} strong backing of the Freedmen's Bureau, {{rejected}} gang-labor work patterns {{that had been used}} in slavery. Instead of gang labor, freedpeople preferred family-based labor groups. They forced planters to <b>bargain</b> <b>for</b> their labor. Such bargaining soon led to the establishment of the system of sharecropping, which gave the freedmen greater economic independence and social autonomy than gang labor. However, because they lacked capital and the planters continued to own the means of production (tools, draft animals and land), the freedmen were forced into producing cash crops (mainly cotton) for the land-owners and merchants, and they entered into a crop-lien system. Widespread poverty, disruption to an agricultural economy too dependent on cotton, and the falling price of cotton, led within decades to the routine indebtedness {{of the majority of the}} freedmen, and poverty by many planters.|$|E
25|$|The Hillsborough County State Attorney's Office confronted Long {{with the}} evidence. The State Attorney and the Public Defender's Office of Hillsborough County reached a plea <b>bargain</b> <b>for</b> {{eight of the}} homicides and the {{abduction}} and rape of Lisa McVey. Long pled guilty on September 24, 1985, {{to all of these}} crimes, receiving 26 life sentences without the possibility of parole (24 concurrent and two to run consecutively to the first 24) and seven life sentences with the possibility of parole after 25 years. In addition, the State retained the option to seek the death penalty for the murder of Michelle Simms. In July 1986, the penalty phase of the Michelle Simms trial was held in Tampa. It lasted one week and again received extensive media attention. Long was found guilty and was sentenced to die in Florida's electric chair.|$|E
