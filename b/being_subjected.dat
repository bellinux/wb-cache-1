5|$|Real-time {{holography}} is {{a second}} method of creating holographic interferograms. A holograph of the unstressed object is created. This holograph is illuminated with a reference beam to generate a hologram image of the object directly superimposed over the original object itself while the object is <b>being</b> <b>subjected</b> to some stress. The object waves from this hologram image will interfere with new waves coming from the object. This technique allows real time monitoring of shape changes.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} it was not {{mandatory}} to flight test new variants of existing engines, and certification testing failed to reveal vibration modes that the fan experienced during the regularly performed power climbs at high altitude. Analysis revealed that the fan was <b>being</b> <b>subjected</b> to high-cycle fatigue stresses worse than expected and also more severe than tested for certification; these higher stresses caused the blade to fracture. Less than a month after grounding, the fleet was allowed to resume operations once the fan blades and fan disc were replaced and the electronic engine controls were modified to reduce maximum engine thrust to 22,000lbf (98kN) from 23,500lbf (105kN). The redesigned fan blades were installed on all CFM56-3C1 and CFM56-3B2 engines, including over 1,800 engines that had already been delivered to customers.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Battle of Cape Esperance, the Japanese Army opted to reinforce their positions on Guadalcanal. To protect their transport convoy from enemy air attack, Admiral Yamamoto sent Haruna and Kongō, escorted by one light cruiser and nine destroyers, to bombard Henderson Field. Because of their high speed, the two battleships could bombard the field and withdraw before <b>being</b> <b>subjected</b> to air attack from aircraft carriers. On the night of 13–14 October, the two battleships shelled Henderson Field from a distance of , firing 973 14-inch shells. In the most successful Japanese battleship action of the war, the bombardment heavily damaged both runways, destroyed almost all available aviation fuel, incapacitated 48 of the airfield's 90 aircraft, and killed 41 men. The Japanese troop convoy reached the island the next day.|$|E

Al-Khawaja and Abdulwahab Hussain told of <b>being</b> <b>subjected</b> to torture during the initial weeks of their detention, the former stating {{that he had been}} sexually assaulted and the latter that he had been forced to sign a written statement. On 19 June, defence lawyers asked the court to disregard confessions that the BICI report had suggested were obtained by torture but the public prosecutor insisted on their inclusion in the evidence. According to Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, these confessions were the sole evidence submitted to the court.|$|E

5|$|During an {{engagement}} early in June 1915 Walpole single-handedly rescued a wounded soldier; his Russian comrades refused {{to help and}} Walpole carried {{one end of a}} stretcher and dragged the man to safety. For this he was awarded the Cross of Saint George; General Lechitsky presented him with the medal in August. After his tour of duty Walpole returned to Petrograd. Among the city's attractions for him was the presence of Konstantin Somov, a painter with whom he had formed a close relationship. He remained there until October 1915, when he returned to England. He visited his family, stayed with Percy Anderson in London, telephoned Henry James in Rye, and retreated to a cottage he had bought in Cornwall. In January 1916 he was asked by the Foreign Office to return to Petrograd. Russians were <b>being</b> <b>subjected</b> to highly effective German propaganda. The writer Arthur Ransome, Petrograd correspondent of The Daily News, had successfully lobbied {{for the establishment of a}} bureau to counter the German efforts, and the British ambassador, Sir George Buchanan, wanted Walpole to take charge.|$|E
5|$|Giovinazzi made a {{slow start}} in the first race and lost the lead to Nobuharu Matsushita. The event was {{affected}} by four safety car periods which closed the field up {{and led to the}} race <b>being</b> <b>subjected</b> to a time limit. Matsushita lost the first position to Marciello who later fended off attempts by Matsushita to reclaim the lead. Giovinazzi recovered and caught up to Marciello and passed him on the 18th lap. He stayed in the lead {{for the remainder of the}} race to clinch his (and his team's) first victory in the GP2 Series. In the second race, Daniël de Jong started from pole position but lost the lead to Matsushita. He then fended off a challenge by de Jong and Oliver Rowland for the position after he made a slow restart. Gasly became the leader when Marciello and Matsushita made contact and held it until Giovinazzi passed him to win the race.|$|E
5|$|In 1226, Duke Konrad I of Masovia {{invited the}} Teutonic Knights {{to help him}} fight the pagan Baltic Prussian people, {{who lived in a}} {{territory}} adjacent to his lands; substantial border warfare was taking place and Konrad's province was suffering from Prussian invasions. On the other hand, the Old Prussians themselves were at that time <b>being</b> <b>subjected</b> to increasingly forced, but largely ineffective Christianization efforts, including Northern Crusades sponsored by the papacy. The Teutonic Order soon overstepped their authority and moved beyond the area granted them by Konrad (Chełmno Land or Kulmerland). In the following decades, they conquered large areas along the Baltic Sea coast and established their own monastic state. As virtually all of the Western Baltic pagans became converted or exterminated (the Prussian conquests were completed by 1283), the Knights confronted Poland and Lithuania, then the last pagan state in Europe. Teutonic wars with Poland and Lithuania continued for most of the 14th and 15th centuries. The Teutonic state in Prussia, populated by German settlers beginning in the 13th century, had been claimed as a fief and protected by the popes and Holy Roman Emperors.|$|E

5000|$|Sexual over-perception {{relative}} to under-perception was reported more frequently among younger participants, among singles, and among participants with an unrestricted socio-sexual orientation. [...] Endorsing and being {{more open to}} casual sex may have evoked more sexual interest {{from members of the}} opposite sex, leading to more frequent reports of sexual overperception. Socially unrestricted male and female high school students were found to report <b>being</b> more <b>subject</b> to sexual harassment as well as sexually harassing others. From this, it is possible that <b>being</b> <b>subject</b> to sexual over-perception may explain the link between socio-sexuality and <b>being</b> <b>subject</b> to sexual harassment.|$|R

However, on {{learning}} of the Jacobite defeat at the Battle of Culloden on 16 April, the ships left, unloading only the Spanish money at Loch nan Uamh, Arisaig on 30 April (the same place from where the prince had disembarked the year before, and would later embark for France). Thus, seven caskets of Spanish gold arrived in Scotland. As the Jacobite cause was by then lost, with the army scattered and the prince and his lieutenants in hiding, the money was {{to be used to}} assist the Jacobite clansmen (then <b>being</b> <b>subjected</b> to the brutalities of the government forces of the Duke of Cumberland) and to facilitate the escape of leading Jacobites to the continent.|$|E

Kabuto then masters snake Sage Justu while modifying his body with DNA samples of the Sound Five, Jugo, Suigetsu, and Karin to increase his abilities further. After perfecting the Reanimation Jutsu, using it to bring back Madara Uchiha as his personal trump card, Kabuto forces Obito Uchiha into a tenuous alliance with him under the promise that he can have Sasuke once they win {{the war against the}} Ninja Alliance. However, during {{the second day of the}} Fourth Great Ninja War, Itachi manages to break free of Kabuto's control and force him to end the Reanimation Jutsu with Sasuke's help. The ordeal of <b>being</b> <b>subjected</b> to Itachi's Izanami genjutsu has Kabuto re-evaluate himself of how to live his life, coming to the conclusion to save Sasuke's life. In the aftermath of the War, Kabuto returned to run the orphanage where he was held when he was a kid together with his adopted brother Urushi. In the Japanese anime, Kabuto is voiced by Nobutoshi Canna, and his English voice actor is Henry Dittman.|$|E
