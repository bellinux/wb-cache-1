40|$|Eggs of the Southern Brazilian {{flounder}} Paralichthys orbignyanus {{were obtained}} through spawning induction and reared in laboratory. The eggs released were free-floating or pelagic. Other important characteristics were: spherical shape, smooth chorion, narrow perivitelline space, {{and a single}} oil globule. Egg and oil globule diameter were about 0. 792 ± 0. 008 mm and 0. 114 ± 0. 003 mm, respectively. The blastodisc was observed approximately 1 h after fertilization and followed by <b>blastodisc</b> <b>cleavage.</b> Blastula stage started after about 5 h and gastrula stage after 9 h. Approximately 20 h after fertilization, blastopore closure was observed. Neurula or early embryo occurred after 24 h. Cardiac beats and movements of the free embryonic tail were recorded after 40 h of incubation. Hatching occurred after an incubation period of 40 - 50 h at temperatures ranging from 18 to 20 ºC. Newly hatched larvae were about 2. 04 ± 0. 024 mm long and quite undeveloped, with a large yolk sac with a posterior oil globule and sparse pigmentation. These results were greatly similar to those obtained by previous studies regarding congener species. This {{is one of the}} first steps towards the artificial propagation of this species under controlled conditions...|$|E

Através do cultivo de ovos do linguado Paralichthys orbignyanus, obtidos de reprodução induzida em laboratório, foram descritos pela primeira vez seus estádios de desenvolvimento. O ovo era livre e flutuante, caracteristicamente pelágico. Além disso, tinha formato esférico, córion liso, espaço perivitelino estreito, vitelo homogêneo, e uma única gota de óleo. Seu diâmetro médio era de 0, 792 ± 0, 008 mm e o da gota de óleo de 0, 114 ± 0, 003 mm. Cerca de 1 h após a fecundação observou-se o blastodisco e em seguida a segmentação celular. A blástula iniciou após cerca de 5 h e a gástrula após 9 h. Com aproximadamente 20 h observou-se o fechamento do blastóporo. A nêurula ou embrião na fase inicial ocorreu após 24 h. Com cerca de 40 h havia batimentos cardíacos e movimentação da cauda do embrião. A eclosão ocorreu num período de 40 a 50 h após a fecundação, em temperaturas de 18 a 20 ºC. A larva tinha um comprimento total médio de 2, 04 ± 0, 024 mm, o saco vitelino bastante volumoso, a gota de óleo em sua porção posterior e pigmentação reduzida e esparsa. Estes resultados foram muito similares aos observados anteriormente em outras espécies congêneres...|$|E
40|$|Myosin- 1 (Myo 1) {{represents}} a mechanical {{link between the}} membrane and actin-cytoskeleton in animal cells. We have studied the effect of Myo 1 inhibitor PClP in 1 - 8 cell Zebrafish embryos. Our results indicate a unique involvement of Myo 1 in early development of Zebrafish embryos. Inhibition of Myo 1 (by PClP) and Myo 2 (by Blebbistatin) lead to arrest in cell division. While Myo 1 isoforms appears to be important for both the formation {{and the maintenance of}} cleavage furrows, Myo 2 is required only for the formation of furrows. We found that the blastodisc of the embryo, which contains a thick actin cortex (~ 13 μm), is loaded with cortical Myo 1. Myo 1 appears to be crucial for maintaining the blastodisc morphology and the actin cortex thickness. In addition to cell division and furrow formation, inhibition of Myo 1 has a drastic effect on the dynamics and distribution of lipid droplets (LDs) in the <b>blastodisc</b> near the <b>cleavage</b> furrow. All these results above are effects of Myo 1 inhibition exclusively; Myo 2 inhibition by blebbistatin does not show such phenotypes. Therefore, our results demonstrate a potential role for Myo 1 in the maintenance and formation of furrow, blastodisc morphology, cell-division and LD organization within the blastodisc during early embryogenesis...|$|R
