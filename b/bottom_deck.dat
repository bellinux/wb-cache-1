25|$|The WMAP's base is a 5.0m-diameter {{solar panel}} array {{that keeps the}} {{instruments}} in shadow during CMB observations, (by keeping the craft constantly angled at 22 degrees, relative to the Sun). Upon the array sit a <b>bottom</b> <b>deck</b> (supporting the warm components) and a top deck. The telescope's cold components: the focal-plane array and the mirrors, are separated from the warm components with a cylindrical, 33cm-long thermal isolation shell atop the deck.|$|E
25|$|Andrea Doria was {{designed}} with her hull divided into 11 watertight compartments, separated by steel bulkheads which {{ran across the}} width of her hull, rising {{from the bottom of}} the ship's hull up to A Deck. The only openings in the bulkheads were on the <b>bottom</b> <b>deck,</b> where watertight doors were installed for use by the engine crew and could be easily closed in an emergency. Her design specified that if any two adjacent compartments out of any of her 11 watertight compartments were breached, she could remain afloat. In addition, following the rules and guidelines set by the International Conference for Safety of Life at Sea of 1948, Andrea Doria was also designed to take a list, even under the worst imaginable circumstances, no more than 15°. However, the combination of the five flooded tanks on one side and the five empty tanks on the other left Andrea Doria with a list which within a few minutes of the collision exceeded 20°. While the collision itself penetrated only one of Andrea Dorias watertight compartments, the severe list would gradually pull the tops of the bulkheads along the starboard side below the level of the water, allowing seawater to flow down corridors, down stairwells, and any other way it could find into the next compartment in line. In addition, the collision had also torn into an access tunnel which ran from the generator room, which was located in the compartment directly aft of where the collision had happened, to a small room at the forward end of the tank compartment which contained the controls for the pumps for the tanks. It was here that there was a fatal flaw in Andrea Dorias design, as at the point where the tunnel went through the bulkhead separating the two compartments, no watertight door was present. This allowed the generator room to flood rapidly, contributing to not only an increase in flooding, but also to a loss of electricity to the stricken liner.|$|E
500|$|Early {{operations}} were problematic; {{in addition to}} supply problems, technical issues also struck. Ramps and taxiways deteriorated under the aircraft's weight, the fuel system was prone to leaks and icing, and bombing and fire control computers were unreliable. The split level cockpit presented a temperature control problem— the pilots' cockpit was heated by sunlight while the observer and the navigator on the <b>bottom</b> <b>deck</b> sat on the ice-cold floor. Thus, a comfortable temperature setting for the pilots caused the other crew members to freeze, while a comfortable temperature for the bottom crew caused the pilots to overheat. The J57 engines proved unreliable. Alternator failure caused the first fatal B-52 crash in February 1956; as a result, the fleet was briefly grounded. In July, fuel and hydraulic issues grounded the B-52s again. In response to maintenance issues, the air force set up [...] "Sky Speed" [...] teams of 50 contractors at each B-52 base to perform maintenance and routine checkups, taking an average of one week per aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the basic}} {{design of the}} ship was based on {{existing}} Seabee ships with a capacity of 38 1,000-ton lighters, Yulius Fuchik was designed for 26 slightly different [...] "Danube-Sea barges" [...] weighing 1,300 tons each. Both the lower deck and the 'tweendeck could accommodate eight [...] barges, two side-by-side, while the longer weather deck had enough space for ten barges, each capable of carrying 1,070 tons of cargo. The barges were moved longitudinally in the cargo holds on remote-controlled platforms. Although the <b>bottom</b> <b>deck,</b> located [...] below the waterline at maximum draught, was protected by a watertight stern door, flooding it while the ship was underway would not have compromised {{the stability of the}} vessel.|$|E
2500|$|After a 10-year, $100 million {{modernization}} in {{the late}} 1980s that included public utility upgrades, Beyer Blinder Belle's commission in 1989 was to create additional perimeter entrances and restore the display windows, main entrance and lobby. [...] On the south facade, the drive-through canopy was removed and two smaller doorways aside the main entrance were added. [...] Display windows, painted over during the earlier modernization campaign, were restored with clear glass to showcase merchant's wares. [...] New main and corner entrances {{were added to the}} rear facade, and the loading dock that occupied the north portion of {{the first floor of the}} river level was removed in order to use the <b>bottom</b> <b>deck</b> of North Bank Drive. [...] Improvements to the lobby included restoration of the original glass curtain wall over the entrance, shop fronts and reception desk using terrazzo floors and wall sconces influenced by the original design.

30|$|Effective depth: The FDOT SDG {{requires}} that cast-in-place decks shall have a bottom reinforcement concrete cover of 2.0 inches (Table  1.4. 2 - 1). The ODOT BDM requires a 1.5 inch minimum {{cover for the}} concrete <b>deck</b> <b>bottom</b> surface (BDM 301.5. 7). The PennDOT DM 4 requires a 1.0 inch minimum cover for the concrete <b>deck</b> <b>bottom</b> surface (DM 4 Part B, 5.12. 3). The INDOT Ch 404 requires a 1.0 inch minimum cover for the concrete <b>deck</b> <b>bottom</b> surface (404 - 2.01. 3). The effective depth {{is a function of}} the deck thickness and the reinforcement cover to the <b>bottom</b> surface of <b>deck.</b> Assuming that the deck thickness varies from 7 to 11 inches and the minimum cover to the bottom surface is 1.0 inch, this research considered a range of 6 – 10.0 inches to be used in the effective depth.|$|R

40|$|Miners in {{underground}} {{coal mines}} experience prolonged exposure to high noise levels, often with A-weighted sound levels {{in excess of}} 90 dB.
