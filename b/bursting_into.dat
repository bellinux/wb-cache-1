5|$|August 4, 1952: In Greyhound's {{most deadly}} {{collision}} two Greyhound buses collided head-on {{with each other}} along the then-U.S. Route 81 near Waco, Texas. The fuel tanks of both buses then ruptured, <b>bursting</b> <b>into</b> flames. Of the 56 persons aboard both coaches, 28 were killed, including both drivers.|$|E
5|$|At Fontainebleau, Catherine {{arranged}} entertainments {{that lasted}} for several days, including fancy-dress jousting and chivalrous events in allegorical settings. On Mardi Gras, {{the day after the}} banquet in the meadow, knights dressed as Greeks and Trojans fought over scantily clad damsels trapped by a giant and a dwarf in a tower on an enchanted island. The fighting climaxed with the tower losing its magical properties and <b>bursting</b> <b>into</b> flames. In another spectacle, singing sirens swam past the king, and Neptune floated by in a chariot drawn by seahorses.|$|E
5|$|Society in {{the urban}} {{settlements}} of the burghs was headed by wealthier merchants, who often held local office as a burgess, alderman, bailies, or {{as a member of}} the burgh council. Below them were craftsmen and workers that made up the majority of the urban population. Both merchants and craftsmen often served a long apprenticeship, acquiring skills and status, before they became freemen of a burgh, and could enjoy certain rights and privileges. Major sources of trade included the export of wool, fish, coal, salt and cattle. Imports included wine, sugar and other luxury goods. Important crafts included metal working, carpentry, leather working, pottery and later brewing and wig-making. There were frequent disputes between the burgesses and craftsmen over rights and political control of the burgh, occasionally <b>bursting</b> <b>into</b> violence, as occurred at Perth in the first half of the sixteenth century.|$|E

5|$|The men {{inside them}} paddled fast on the treadmills, and the ships glided {{forwards}} {{as though they}} were flying, yet no one was visible on board. The enemy thought that they were made of paper. Then all of a sudden a thunderclap bomb was let off. It was made with paper (carton) and filled with lime and sulphur. (Launched from trebuchets) these thunderclap bombs came dropping down from the air, and upon meeting the water exploded with a noise like thunder, the sulphur <b>bursting</b> <b>into</b> flames. The carton case rebounded and broke, scattering the lime to form a smoky fog, which blinded the eyes of men and horses so that they could see nothing. Our ships then went forward to attack theirs, and their men and horses were all drowned, so that they were utterly defeated.|$|E
5|$|On September 2009, Glickenhaus {{announced}} {{his intention to}} race {{a new version of}} the P4/5 in the 2010 24 Hours Nürburgring. The car, called the P4/5 Competizione, would not be a conversion of his road car but instead an entirely new car with a Ferrari chassis, VIN and drivetrain. On May 2010 however, it was revealed that the Competizione would in fact be raced in 2011, based on a 430 Scuderia. It would be built to FIA GT2 standards and raced by Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus in an Experimental Class under the direction of Paolo Garella, former Head of Special Projects at Pininfarina. Ferrari completely distanced themselves from the P4/5 Competizione project in 2011, refusing to sell the team parts for vital engine rebuilds between races. The car finished 39th in the 2011 24 Hours Nürburgring (after <b>bursting</b> <b>into</b> flames) and in 2012 won its class and finished 12th overall.|$|E
5|$|From the {{earliest}} times, the Chinese {{were concerned with}} the destructive force of earthquakes. It was recorded in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian of 91BC that in 780BC an earthquake had been powerful enough to divert the courses of three rivers. It was not known {{at the time that}} earthquakes were caused by the shifting of tectonic plates in the Earth's crust; instead, the people of the ancient Zhou Dynasty explained them as disturbances with cosmic yin and yang, along with the heavens' displeasure with acts committed (or the common peoples' grievances ignored) by the current ruling dynasty. These theories were ultimately derived from the ancient text of the Yijing (Book of Changes), in its fifty-first hexagram. There were other early theories about earthquakes, developed by those such as the ancient Greeks. Anaxagoras (c.500–428BC) believed that they were caused by excess water near the surface crust of the earth <b>bursting</b> <b>into</b> the Earth's hollows; Democritus (c. 460–370BC) believed that the saturation of the Earth with water caused them; Anaximenes (c.585–c.525BC) believed they were the result of massive pieces of the Earth falling into the cavernous hollows due to drying; and Aristotle (384–322BC) believed they were caused by instability of vapor (pneuma) caused by the drying of the moist Earth by the Sun's rays.|$|E

25|$|One-Two-GO Airlines Flight 269 (OG269), a McDonnell Douglas MD-82, {{crashed into}} an {{embankment}} beside runway 27 at Phuket International Airport (HKT) <b>bursting</b> <b>into</b> flames upon impact on September 16, 2007, at about 15:41 ICT during an attempted go-around after an aborted landing, killing 89 of the 130 persons on board. (One survivor succumbed to burn injuries {{several days after}} the crash.) OG269 was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Bangkok to Phuket, Thailand.|$|E
25|$|The crew never {{realized}} {{the severity of}} the fire. The fire was already too severe and started to degrade the structural integrity of the lift wing. This caused the crew to hardly be able to control the aircraft. The crew had to apply maximum aileron trim setting due to the reduction of the stiffness of the wing. The left wing then failed upwards, causing the aircraft to roll through 90 degree and crash, subsequently <b>bursting</b> <b>into</b> flames and killing everyone on board.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} popular modern plays dealing with Elvis {{impersonation}} is Lee Hall's Cooking with Elvis (1999). The comedy centers on the family life of Dad, an Elvis impersonator who was paralyzed in a car crash and is forced {{to spend the rest of}} his life in a wheel chair. Climaxes of the play are surreal fantasy scenes in which Dad's hallucinatory Elvis dreams are <b>bursting</b> <b>into</b> popular Presley songs as a reminiscence of his one-time persona of Elvis impersonator.|$|E
25|$|Both {{aircraft}} {{crashed into}} a wood, <b>bursting</b> <b>into</b> flames on impact. After fire and rescue crews put out the fires, the Avro York {{was found to be}} completely destroyed by the crash and {{the only part of the}} DC-6 that was still intact was the rudder and tailplane, with the rest of the DC-6 also being destroyed by the fire. All seven passengers and crew of the Avro York died and all thirty-two passengers and crew of the DC-6 also died, bringing the total number of deaths to thirty-nine.|$|E

25|$|Flight 4146 was a {{scheduled}} domestic passenger flight from Beijing Capital International Airport, Beijing to Chongqing Airport, Chongqing, with 98 passengers and {{a crew of}} ten on board. As Flight 4146 neared Chongqing, the aircraft's Number Four engine (the outer engine on the right wing) caught fire. The fire burned the engine mount and the engine fell off the aircraft's wing. This caused a loss of control. Flight 4146 hit a power line and two farmhouses before <b>bursting</b> <b>into</b> flames. Everyone on board the Ilyushin Il-18 perished in the crash.|$|E
25|$|At 16:58 On 16 October 1948, Alon and Ezer Weizman {{took off}} from Herzliya to attack Egyptian forces {{operating}} {{in the vicinity of}} Isdud, not far from where both had participated in the squadron's combat debut in May. Returning to base, Alon had trouble lowering the plane's landing gear and consequently began flying violent maneuvers to try and force the wheels to lower. The Avia's engine started streaming white smoke and the aircraft began losing altitude before hitting the ground and <b>bursting</b> <b>into</b> flames, instantly killing Alon. He was survived by his wife, Mina, three months pregnant at the time. Alon's daughter, Michal, would later serve her mandatory IDF service with 101 Squadron.|$|E
25|$|Some {{statues of}} Joseph depict his staff as topped with flowers, recalling the non-canonical Protoevangelion's {{account of how}} Mary's spouse was chosen by {{collecting}} the walking sticks of widowers in Palestine, and Joseph's alone <b>bursting</b> <b>into</b> flower, thus identifying him as divinely chosen. The Golden Legend, which derives its account from the much older Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, tells a similar story, although it notes that all marriageable men of the Davidic line and not only widowers were ordered by the High Priest to present their rods at the Temple. Several Eastern Orthodox Nativity icons show Joseph tempted by the Devil (depicted as {{an old man with}} furled wings) to break off his betrothal, and how he resists that temptation. There are some paintings with him wearing a Jewish hat.|$|E
