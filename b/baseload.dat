5|$|In 2008, solar {{electricity}} was not cost competitive with bulk, <b>baseload</b> power. However, it does provide electricity {{when and where}} power is most limited and most expensive, which is a strategic contribution.

5|$|Electric power {{generated}} from wind {{power can be}} highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant. Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve, and (at high penetration levels) could require {{an increase in the}} already existing energy demand management, load shedding, storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables. The variability of wind is quite different from solar, wind may be producing power at night when other <b>baseload</b> plants are often overproducing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{growth of}} {{renewable}} resources will introduce significant variability and uncertainty into the grid. It {{is likely that}} “peaker ” plants will be a crucial dispatchable resource for compensating for the variations in renewable supply. Thus, {{it is important to}} understand the strategic incentives of peaker plants and their potential for exploiting market power due to having responsive supply. To this end, we study an oligopolistic two-settlement market comprising of two types of generation (<b>baseloads</b> and peakers) where there is perfect foresight. We characterize symmetric equilibria in this context via closed-form expressions. However, we also show that, when the system is capacity-constrained, there may not exist equilibria in which <b>baseloads</b> and peakers play symmetric strategies. This happens because of opportunities for both types of generation to exploit market power to increase prices. I...|$|R
40|$|International audiencen the French {{context of}} {{increasing}} renewable penetration and significant nuclear power, the optimal contribution of this energy source is discussed from two viewpoints. On the one hand, {{from the social}} planner viewpoint, the nuclear optimum contribution {{is the one that}} minimizes the overall electric price, whatever the resulting load factor. The use of screening curves, often implemented to design the optimal power mix is questioned, being highly sensitive to the assumptions. On the other hand, from the plant operator viewpoint, the nuclear power plants need to amortize the capital expenses, hence achieve the longest operating time. With a view to make the two viewpoints meet, we propose to operate nuclear power plants as <b>baseloads</b> and consider modulation through the power use, i. e. supply electricity to the electric system when requested and use the remaining power to produce other valuable products, such as heat or hydrogen...|$|R
5|$|In the UK {{there were}} 124 {{separate}} occasions from 2008 to 2010 when the nation's wind output fell {{to less than}} 2% of installed capacity. A report on Denmark's wind power noted that their wind power network provided less than 1% of average demand on 54 days during the year 2002. Wind power advocates argue that these periods of low wind {{can be dealt with}} by simply restarting existing power stations that have been held in readiness, or interlinking with HVDC. Electrical grids with slow-responding thermal power plants and without ties to networks with hydroelectric generation may have to limit the use of wind power. According to a 2007 Stanford University study published in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology, interconnecting ten or more wind farms can allow an average of 33% of the total energy produced (i.e. about 8% of total nameplate capacity) to be used as reliable, <b>baseload</b> electric power which can be relied on to handle peak loads, as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height.|$|E
25|$|Power {{could be}} {{relatively}} quickly redirected directly to areas that need it most.

40|$|Power systems {{based on}} the {{simplest}} direct integration of a pressurized solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) generator and a gas turbine (GT) are capable of converting natural gas fuel energy to electric power with efficiencies of approximately 60 % (net AC/LHV), and more complex SOFC and gas turbine arrangements can be devised for achieving even higher efficiencies. The results of a project are discussed {{that focused on the}} development of a conceptual design for a pressurized SOFC/GT power system that was intended to generate 20 MWe with at least 70 % efficiency. The power system operates <b>baseloaded</b> in a distributed-generation application. To achieve high efficiency, the system integrates an intercooled, recuperated, reheated gas turbine with two SOFC generator stages [...] one operating at high pressure, and generating power, as well as providing all heat needed by the high-pressure turbine, while the second SOFC generator operates at a lower pressure, generates power, and provides all heat for the low-pressure reheat turbine. The system cycle is described, major system components are sized, the system installed-cost is estimated, and the physical arrangement of system components is discussed. Estimates of system power output, efficiency, and emissions at the design point are also presented, and the system cost of electricity estimate is developed...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, we {{investigate}} optimal operation of energy storage units in power {{transmission and distribution}} grids. At transmission level, {{we investigate}} the problem where an investor-owned independently-operated energy storage system seeks to offer energy and ancillary services in the day-ahead and real-time markets. We specifically consider the case where {{a significant portion of}} the power generated in the grid is from renewable energy resources and there exists significant uncertainty in system operation. In this regard, we formulate a stochastic programming framework to choose optimal energy and reserve bids for the storage units that takes into account the fluctuating nature of the market prices due to the randomness in the renewable power generation availability. At distribution level, we develop a comprehensive data set to model various stochastic factors on power distribution networks, with focus on networks that have high penetration of electric vehicle charging load and distributed renewable generation. Furthermore, we develop a data-driven stochastic model for energy storage operation at distribution level, where the distribution of nodal voltage and line power flow are modelled as stochastic functions of the energy storage unit’s charge and discharge schedules. In particular, we develop new closed-form stochastic models for such key operational parameters in the system. Our approach is analytical and allows formulating tractable optimization problems. Yet, it does not involve any restricting assumption on the distribution of random parameters, hence, it results in accurate modeling of uncertainties. By considering the specific characteristics of random variables, such as their statistical dependencies and often irregularly-shaped probability distributions, we propose a non-parametric chance-constrained optimization approach to operate and plan energy storage units in power distribution girds. In the proposed stochastic optimization, we consider uncertainty from various elements, such as solar photovoltaic, electric vehicle chargers, and residential <b>baseloads,</b> in the form of discrete probability functions. In the last part of this thesis we address some other resources and concepts for enhancing the operation of power distribution and transmission systems. In particular, we proposed a new framework to determine the best sites, sizes, and optimal payment incentives under special contracts for committed-type DG projects to offset distribution network investment costs. In this framework, the aim is to allocate DGs such that the profit gained by the distribution company is maximized while each DG unit’s individual profit is also taken into account to assure that private DG investment remains economical...|$|R

25|$|During the 1970s and 1980s rising {{economic}} costs (related to extended construction times {{largely due to}} regulatory changes and pressure-group litigation) and falling fossil fuel prices made nuclear power plants then under construction less attractive.

Diamonds are extracted at Argyle diamond mine in far north of the Kimberley region. Coal mined at Collie is the main fuel for <b>baseload</b> electricity generation in the state's south-west.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2007 {{study of}} {{wind in the}} United States, ten or more widely {{separated}} wind farms connected through the grid could be relied upon for from 33 to 47% of their average output (15–20% of nominal capacity) as reliable, <b>baseload</b> power, as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height. When calculating the generating capacity available to meet summer peak demand, ERCOT (manages Texas grid) counts wind generation at 8.7% of nameplate capacity.|$|E
25|$|However, {{nuclear power}} is {{relatively}} inflexible; although nuclear power can reduce its output reasonably quickly. Since {{the cost of}} nuclear power is dominated by its high infrastructure costs, the cost per unit energy goes up significantly with low production. Because of this, nuclear power is mostly used for <b>baseload.</b> By way of contrast, hydroelectricity can supply peak power at much lower cost. Hydroelectricity is thus often used to complement nuclear or other sources for load following.|$|E
25|$|A dam which impounds a large {{reservoir}} {{can store}} and release a correspondingly {{large amount of}} energy, by controlling river outflow and raising or lowering its reservoir level a few meters. Limitations do apply to dam operation, their releases are commonly subject to government regulated water rights to limit downstream effect on rivers. For example, there are grid situations where <b>baseload</b> thermal plants, nuclear or wind turbines are already producing excess power at night, dams are still required to release enough water to maintain adequate river levels, whether electricity is generated or not. Conversely there's a limit to peak capacity, which if excessive could cause a river to flood {{for a few hours}} each day.|$|E
25|$|Biochar (charcoal {{created by}} {{pyrolysis}} of biomass) {{is a potent}} form of longterm (thousands of years) biosequestration of atmosphereic CO2 derived from investigation of the extremely fertile Terra preta soils of the Amazon Basin. Placing biochar in soils also improves water quality, increases soil fertility, raises agricultural productivity and reduce pressure on old growth forests. As a method of generating bio-energy with carbon storage Rob Flanagan and the EPRIDA biochar company have developed low-tech cooking stoves for developing nations that can burn agricultural wastes such as rice husks and produce 15% by weight of biochar; while BEST Energies in NSW Australia have spent a decade developing an Agrichar technology that can combust 96 tonnes of dry biomass each day, generating 30-40 tonnes of biochar. A parametric study of biosequestration by Malcolm Fowles at the Open University, indicated that to mitigate global warming, policies should encourage displacement of coal with biomass as a power source for <b>baseload</b> electricity generation if the latter’s conversion efficiency rose over 30%, otherwise biosequestering carbon from biomass as a cheaper mitigation option than geosequestration by CO2 capture and storage.|$|E
25|$|Many {{existing}} hydroelectric dams {{are fairly}} old (for example, the Hoover Dam {{was built in}} the 1930s), and their original design predated the newer intermittent power sources such as wind and solar by decades. A hydroelectric dam originally built to provide <b>baseload</b> power will have its generators sized according to the average flow of water into the reservoir. Uprating such a dam with additional generators increases its peak power output capacity, thereby increasing its capacity to operate as a virtual grid energy storage unit. The United States Bureau of Reclamation reports an investment cost of $69 per kilowatt capacity to uprate an existing dam, compared to more than $400 per kilowatt for oil-fired peaking generators. While an uprated hydroelectric dam does not directly store excess energy from other generating units, it behaves equivalently by accumulating its own fuel – incoming river water – during periods of high output from other generating units. Functioning as a virtual grid storage unit in this way, the uprated dam {{is one of the most}} efficient forms of energy storage, because it has no pumping losses to fill its reservoir, only increased losses to evaporation and leakage.|$|E

Using thermal energy storage systems, solar thermal operating periods can even be extended to meet <b>baseload</b> needs.

500|$|In an {{electricity}} {{system without}} grid energy storage, generation from stored fuels (coal, biomass, natural gas, nuclear) must be {{go up and}} down in reaction to {{the rise and fall of}} solar electricity (see load following power plant). [...] While hydroelectric and natural gas plants can quickly follow solar being intermittent due to the weather, coal, biomass and nuclear plants usually take considerable time to respond to load and can only be scheduled to follow the predictable variation. [...] Depending on local circumstances, beyond about 20–40% of total generation, grid-connected intermittent sources like solar tend to require investment in some combination of grid interconnections, energy storage or demand side management. Integrating large amounts of solar power with existing generation equipment has caused issues in some cases. For example, in Germany, California and Hawaii, electricity prices have been known to go negative when solar is generating a lot of power, displacing existing <b>baseload</b> generation contracts.|$|E

The addition of coal-fired generation to meet this need for more <b>baseload</b> generation does not result in any significant differences in annual emissions of SO2, NOx and Hg because of the caps on those pollutants.

2500|$|For {{many years}} {{there was a}} {{consensus}} within the electric utilities in the U.S. that renewable electricity generators such as wind and solar are so unreliable and intermittent that they {{will never be able}} to contribute significantly to electric supply or provide <b>baseload</b> power.

2500|$|Heat storage {{allows a}} solar thermal plant to produce {{electricity}} {{at night and}} on overcast days. [...] This allows the use of solar power for <b>baseload</b> generation as well as peak power generation, with the potential of displacing both coal- and natural gas-fired power plants.

Since it is typically not cost effective to store significant amounts of electricity during a period of low demand for use during a period of high demand, costs will vary significantly depending on the time of day. Low cost generation capacity (<b>baseload)</b> such as nuclear can take many hours to [...] start, meaning a surplus in times of low demand, whereas high cost but flexible generating capacity (such as gas turbines) must be kept available to respond at a moment's notice (spinning reserve) to peak demand, perhaps being used for a few minutes per day, which is very expensive.|$|E

Good locations are over deep granite covered by a thick (3–5km) layer of insulating sediments which slow heat loss. There are HDR and EGS systems currently being developed and tested in France, Australia, Japan, Germany, the U.S. and Switzerland.

2500|$|The most {{important}} use for pumped storage {{has traditionally been}} to balance <b>baseload</b> powerplants, but may {{also be used to}} abate the fluctuating output of intermittent energy sources. Pumped storage provides a load at times of high electricity output and low electricity demand, enabling additional system peak capacity. In certain jurisdictions, electricity prices may be close to zero or occasionally negative on occasions that there is more electrical generation available than there is load available to absorb it; although at present this is rarely due to wind or solar power alone, increased wind and solar generation will increase the likelihood of such occurrences. It is particularly likely that pumped storage will become especially important as a balance for very large scale photovoltaic generation. Increased long distance transmission capacity combined with significant amounts of energy storage will be a crucial part of regulating any large-scale deployment of intermittent renewable power sources.

[...] In 2015, a Koch-funded institute of Utah State University stated that the cost of wind energy is higher than most cost estimates calculate. Renewable portfolio standards require renewable energy to exist (most of them intermittent such as wind and solar), but at the expense of utilities and consumers.
