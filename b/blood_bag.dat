The Architecture of Indonesian blood traceability system has been made with regard to the entire supply chain actors follows the needs and the existing processes. Barcode technology is used to support the data entry of smart blood traceability system. The coding of blood products and shipping has been created using Barcode tags. The smart blood traceability system model was designed using the use case diagram, class diagram and others diagrams in UML approach. The Bloodtrace software was developed and was conducted the try out in one PMI regions in Jawa Timur...|$|R

After immersion ethanol concentration in <b>blood</b> <b>bags</b> was below detection limit.

Inner surface of the bag material was unchanged according to our infrared spectrometry results. Also endurance testing showed no altered results.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Autologous blood {{transfusion}} (ABT) efficiently increases sport performance {{and is the}} most challenging doping method to detect. Current methods for detecting this practice center on the plasticizer di(2 -ethlyhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), which enters the stored <b>blood</b> from <b>blood</b> <b>bags.</b> Quantification of this plasticizer and its metabolites in urine can detect the transfusion of autologous blood stored in these <b>bags.</b> However, DEHP-free <b>blood</b> <b>bags</b> {{are available on the}} market, including n-butyryl-tri-(n-hexyl) -citrate (BTHC) <b>blood</b> <b>bags.</b> Athletes may shift to using such bags to avoid the detection of urinary DEHP metabolites. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A clinical randomized double-blinded two-phase study was conducted of healthy male volunteers who underwent ABT using DEHP-containing or BTHC <b>blood</b> <b>bags.</b> All subjects received a saline injection for the control phase and a blood donation followed by ABT 36 days later. Kinetic excretion of five urinary DEHP metabolites was quantified with liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Surprisingly, considerable levels of urinary DEHP metabolites were observed up to 1 day after {{blood transfusion}} with BTHC <b>blood</b> <b>bags.</b> The long-term metabolites mono-(2 -ethyl- 5 -carboxypentyl) phthalate and mono-(2 -carboxymethylhexyl) phthalate were the most sensitive biomarkers to detect ABT with BTHC <b>blood</b> <b>bags.</b> Levels of DEHP were high in BTHC bags (6. 6 %), the tubing in the transfusion kit (25. 2 %), and the white blood cell filter (22. 3 %). CONCLUSIONS: The BTHC bag contained DEHP, despite being labeled DEHP-free. Urinary DEHP metabolite measurement is a cost-effective way to detect ABT in the antidoping field even when BTHC bags are used for blood storage...|$|R

5000|$|The {{separation}} of individual blood components {{is done with}} a specialized centrifuge (see apheresis).

Since each <b>blood</b> <b>bag</b> (usually 250 mL or 500 mL) contains {{a relatively small number}} of platelets, it can take as many as a dozen blood bags (usually from 5 to 10 bags, depending on the size of the blood bags and each donor's platelet count) to accumulate a single unit of platelets (enough for one patient). This greatly increases the risks of the transfusion. Each unit of platelets separated from donated whole blood is called a [...] "platelet concentrate".|$|E

40|$|Degree Project Thesis, Programme in Medicine. TITLE:Real Time Monitoring of Erythrocytes With the QTA Tracer System At the Ryhov County Hospital Blood Center Resulted in Changed Routine. Introduction	About 500 000 blood {{units are}} {{collected}} from blood donors {{and used for}} the preparation of blood components for blood transfusion in Sweden every year. The shelf life of a red blood cell (RBC) unit in SAGM solution is 42 days within a controlled temperature environment of 2 - 6 ˚C. There is limited knowledge about how time and especially temperature affect blood units. However, even today´s blood units {{all over the world}} are transported to different health care sites without a guaranteed quality control of the required cold-chain. Purpose	The purpose of this thesis is to explore the actual temperature variation during internal storage and internal transports of blood units during its actual shelf life in its real environment. Method	At the Blood Center at Ryhov the QTA Tracer System® was used log the temperature and time. Tracers were attached to <b>blood</b> <b>bags</b> that then were stored at the internal refrigerators or transported between Jönköping and Värnamo. The log-files were then analyzed with excel spreadsheet to identify individual <b>blood</b> <b>bags,</b> i. e. tracers, that were out of temperature range. Conclusions	The test showed that there were actual deviations from the standards in the physical environments surrounding the <b>blood</b> <b>bags</b> even though the procedures were followed. To all the <b>blood</b> <b>bags</b> that reached below 0 °C a control of their level of hemolysis were performed. The fact that all of them had well below the stipulated 0. 8 % of hemolysis could raise the question of the ‘zero-tolerance’ to go below 0 °C due to the risk of hemolysis. The blood center made some minor changes to some of procedures to reduce the deviations. They also continuously monitor their <b>blood</b> <b>bags</b> to incremental develop their routines...|$|R

40|$|Background: Many modern {{surgical}} procedures {{could not be}} carried out {{without the use of}} blood. There are no substitutes for human blood. Thus, proper utilization of blood is necessary with minimal wasting. Materials and Methods: A total of 10, 582 donors donated blood during the study period of 19 months in blood bank of a tertiary care hospital, central India from 1 st of November 2009 to 31 st May 2011, which were screened. Results: A total of 346 whole <b>blood</b> <b>bags</b> were discarded. Out of these 346 <b>blood</b> <b>bags,</b> 257 (74. 30 %) were discarded because of seropositivity for transfusion transmissible infectious diseases. A total of 542 blood components were discarded against 3702 blood components prepared during the study period. Among blood components discarded, most common units were platelets. The most common cause of discarding the blood components was expiry of date due to non-utilization (87. 00 %). Conclusion: A properly conducted donor interview, notification of permanently deferred donors will help in discarding less number of bags from collected units. Similarly, properly implemented blood transfusion policies will also help in discarding less number of <b>blood</b> <b>bags</b> due to expiry. These discarded bags, because they are unutilized are both financially as well as socially harmful to the blood bank...|$|R

50|$|When {{the empty}} phase is initiated, the {{centrifuge}} begins braking. The clamps change positions, enabling {{the transfer of}} the wash bowl contents to the reinfusion bag. The centrifuge bowl must come to a complete stop before the pump begins a clockwise rotation to empty the bowl. Once the bowl is emptied, the cycle is ended and a new cycle can be begun. The reinfusion bag attached to the autotransfusion wash set should not be used for high pressure infusion back to the patient. The reinfusion bag contains a significant amount of air, careful monitoring should take place during reinfusion to avoid the potential of air embolism. Therefore, it is recommended to use a separate <b>blood</b> <b>bag</b> attached to the reinfusion bag. This second bag can then be disconnected, air purged from it, and then tied off before giving to anesthesia for reinfusion. Thus reducing the chances of an air embolism. In accordance with Guidelines set by the American Association of Blood Banks the blood should be reinfused within 4 hours from washing.|$|E
