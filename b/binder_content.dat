The higher asphalt will help mitigate cracking and provided for greater durability. Conversely, a mix for a high volume roadway can be designed with a high Ndes level, which will yield a mixture that is lower in asphalt, thus minimizing rutting.|$|E

5000|$|FMA is a gap-graded {{mix with}} a high coarse {{aggregate}} (stone) content of 70-80 %, binder (asphalt) content of 6 % and filler (limestone sand) content of around 7-11 %. The percentage of cellulose fibre that {{is required for the}} FMA is 0.4 % and air voids of around 4 %. The skeletal formation of the coarse aggregate provides high resistance to deformation. Adding the fibres to the binder will prevent the asphalt from draining off during storage, transport and paving. The mastic fills the voids and retaining the aggregate in place. It has an additional stabilising effect, as well as providing the designed air voids. The result is a highly durable rut resistant asphalt mix. FMA can be used on all types of road and it is suitable for roads with heavy traffic loads and frequency. It is high <b>binder</b> <b>content</b> gives a longer lifetime than conventional mixes. Furthermore, it allows for the bitumen to bulk or thicken in order to prevent it from running off the aggregate before compaction. Its coarse and open texture generally provides high skid resistance at all speeds, as well as good drainage and fewer spray problems. Modification and stabilization of the asphalt binder is the approach to improve the pavement performance especially for the gap-graded mixtures such as FMA, which required higher viscosity asphalt binder. The method for this asphalt binder modification is by adding cellulose fibre and other oil- based materials are being used to enhance the viscosity of the base binder.|$|E

The binder drainage test, {{developed by the}} Transport Research Laboratory, UK, is commonly used to set an upper limit on the acceptable <b>binder</b> <b>content</b> for a porous mix. This paper {{presents the results of}} a laboratory investigation {{to determine the effects of}} different binder types on the binder drainage characteristics of porous mix made of various maximum aggregate sizes 20, 14 and 10 mm. Two types of binder were used, conventional 60 / 70 pen bitumen, and styrene butadiene styrene (SBS) modified bitumen. The amount of binder lost through drainage after three hours at the maximum mixing temperature were measured in duplicate for mixes of different maximum sizes and binder contents. The maximum mixing temperature adopted depends on the types of binder used. The retained binder is plotted against the initial mixed <b>binder</b> <b>content,</b> together with the line of equality where the retained binder equals the mixed <b>binder</b> <b>content.</b> The results indicate the significant contribution of using SBS modified bitumen to increase the target bitumen <b>binder</b> <b>content.</b> Their significance is discussed in terms of target <b>binder</b> <b>content,</b> the critical <b>binder</b> <b>content,</b> the maximum mixed <b>binder</b> <b>content</b> and the maximum retained <b>binder</b> <b>content</b> values obtained from the binder drainage test.

40|$|Many times a road {{will fail}} {{and will be}} in need of both a {{structural}} increase and a repair. Full Depth Reclamation (FDR) is a road rehabilitation technique able to offer both. This method also has a lower total cost and significantly lower material usage than traditional overlaying repair methods. FDR is a road repair method which mills up the current road down into the subgrade, and then stabilizes and compacts the milled material. This is also useful for correcting deeper problems in the road structure which are not addressed by traditional methods. In this study, three different suggestions of mix designs for this repair method were observed, and {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of each were compared. A consistent problem with the more thorough mix designs was that there is a large amount of equipment required from different fields of engineering: many of the tests required equipment from both a soils and a pavements laboratory. In an effort to streamline testing equipment, the results of a modified Proctor test were compared to the results of densities of samples tested in a gyratory compactor at varying water contents. The Proctor and gyratory compactor both gave similar trends between water content and dry density. The gyratory compactor testing was also much quicker, and the data had a tighter fit line. This is an important step in simplifying FDR mix design in order to make it more widely available. Samples with <b>binder</b> <b>contents</b> of 2 %, 3 %, and 4 % and water contents varying from 2 %- 6 % were created in a slotted gyratory compactor.

The deformation resistance was determined via dynamic die-penetration tests, the cracking resistance by means of uniaxial tensile tests and cooling experiments and the fatigue resistance with the aid of uniaxial pulsating tensile-stress tests at three different testing temperatures. The compaction resistance of chipping-filled mastic asphalts with very high chipping contents exhibits practically no reaction to changes in the <b>binder</b> <b>content.</b> The deformation resistance decreases moderately as the <b>binder</b> <b>content</b> increases. The cracking resistance is improved slightly by higher binder contents.
