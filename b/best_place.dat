The Brazilian commander took the steamship Dom Afonso (named in honor of the late Prince Afonso) and entered the port at Buenos Aires to select the <b>best</b> <b>place</b> to disembark his troops. He expected to have to defeat the Argentine flotilla anchored there, but the force did nothing to stop him and he safely returned to Sacramento to plan his assault. The attack was aborted, however, when news arrived of the Allied victory at Caseros.|$|E
5|$|NESCo were {{represented}} by Craig Henderson and Sydney Turner. The NESCo representatives argued {{that although the}} company already supplied around 85% of the North East region, {{a great deal more}} generating capacity would need to be built to meet the demand for years to come, and that the mid-Durham area was the <b>best</b> <b>place</b> to erect a new station. Henderson claimed the only real opposition to the scheme was that it would interfere with the amenities of Durham. John Hacking, chief engineer of the Central Electricity Board, backed NESCo because if the scheme were declined, and consent and new arrangements had to be made, they would have no new plant in operation until after 1948.|$|E

5|$|The Port Phillip {{team were}} favourites {{before the game}} began. This was partly owing to their bowlers' use of overarm bowling at pace; by contrast, bowlers in Tasmania {{preferred}} underarm bowling {{at a time when}} roundarm bowling was permitted {{in the rest of the}} world. The match was played at the Launceston Racecourse ground, but the state of the ground was such that the umpires were unsure of the <b>best</b> <b>place</b> to pitch the wickets. The Victorian team were dismayed by the state of the pitch, which looked extremely difficult to bat on, and later received an apology from the government of Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|An army {{commanded}} by Caxias crossed into Uruguay in September 1851. The allies decided to divide their forces into two armies: a multinational force {{that included a}} single Brazilian division, and a second army composed entirely of Brazilians under Caxias. Against the wishes of Honório Hermeto, Caxias chose Manuel Marques de Sousa (later Count of Porto Alegre) to lead the former force. Caxias met and befriended Marques de Sousa, who had served under his command in the War of the Ragamuffins, during his trip to Rio Grande do Sul in 1839. The Brazilian division, led by Marques de Sousa, along with Uruguayan and Argentine rebel troops, invaded Argentina. On 3 February 1852, in the Battle of Caseros, the allies defeated an army led by Rosas, who fled to the United Kingdom, thus ending the war. Caxias spent 17 January aboard the frigate Dom Afonso alongside John Pascoe Grenfell, taking stock of the port area of Buenos Aires, the Argentine capital, selecting the <b>best</b> <b>place</b> to launch an amphibious attack. His plan was aborted once {{the news of the}} victory at Caseros arrived. As a reward {{for his role in the}} victory, Caxias was promoted to lieutenant general on 3 March, and raised to marquis on 26 June.|$|E
5|$|Charles met Frederick Kemp, a {{land agent}} newly arrived in Poulton {{from his native}} Essex, and {{introduced}} him to his brother, {{who was on the}} lookout for a steward or agent. Kemp, well-dressed and charming, made a good impression on Hesketh, who employed him immediately. At the meeting of the railway committee Hesketh put forward a persuasive argument. Despite opposition from the Lytham contingent the committee decided that Rossall Point was the <b>best</b> <b>place</b> for the railway terminus to be built, and the Railway and Port Company was formed. In the early 19th century it was thought that steam locomotives would be unable to negotiate hilly terrain, and that Lake District hills like Shap Fell would prevent the railway from reaching Scotland. The Fylde terminus would have even more importance than Hesketh had hoped, providing a sea link for passengers from London to travel on to Scotland. Initially Hesketh had considered naming his new town New Liverpool or Wyreton, but after changing his name to Hesketh-Fleetwood in 1831 he decided to call it Fleetwood. With a new career in parliament to prepare for, he readily handed over financial management of the project to his manager, Frederick Kemp.|$|E

5|$|Duperré did {{not meet}} any British ships on his journey back to the French island, {{as most of the}} British {{blockade}} squadron were engaged {{in the aftermath of the}} Invasion of Île Bonaparte, conducted during July by Commodore Rowley. With the British distracted by this amphibious operation, it was simple for Duperré to reach Grand Port on the south east coast of Île de France in spite of the small blockade squadron under Captain Samuel Pym. This narrow and well-protected anchorage was considered to be the <b>best</b> <b>place</b> to refit the battered French squadron, but in August it came under attack by a British squadron in the Battle of Grand Port. This action was a disaster for the British as their ships became grounded in the unfamiliar shoals of the harbour and four frigates were lost under fire from shore batteries and Duperré's squadron.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006 Ofcom {{commissioned}} research among {{residents of}} the London boroughs of Hackney, Haringey and Lambeth, finding that about 24 percent of all adults aged 14 or older living within the three London boroughs listen to pirate radio stations. The research found that 37 percent of students aged 14–24 and 41 percent of the African-Caribbean community listened to pirate radio. The development and promotion of grass-roots talent, the urban music scene and minority community groups were identified as key drivers for pirate radio. According to the research both pirate radio listeners and those running pirate radio stations thought that licensed broadcasters failed to cater sufficiently {{for the needs of}} the public at large. Pirate radio was regarded as the <b>best</b> <b>place</b> to hear new music and particularly urban music. Furthermore, pirate radio stations were appreciated for their local relevance by providing information and advertisements about local community events, businesses and club nights.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to diversify the economy and make it less {{dependent}} on export goods, the government has pushed to increase tourism to Malaysia. As a result, tourism has become Malaysia's third largest source of foreign exchange, although it is threatened by {{the negative effects of}} the growing industrial economy, with large amounts of air and water pollution along with deforestation affecting tourism. The tourism sector came under some pressure in 2014 when the national carrier Malaysia Airlines had one of its planes disappear in March, while another was brought down by a missile over Ukraine in July, resulting in the loss of a total 537 passengers and crew. The state of the airline, which had been unprofitable for 3 years, prompted the government in August 2014 to nationalise the airline by buying up the 30 per cent it did not already own. Between 2013 and 2014, Malaysia has been listed {{as one of the best}} places to retire to in the world, with the country in third position on the Global Retirement Index. This in part was the result of the Malaysia My Second Home programme to allow foreigners to live in the country on a long-stay visa for up to 10 years. In 2016, Malaysia ranked the fifth position on The World's Best Retirement Havens while getting in the first place as the <b>best</b> <b>place</b> in Asia to retire. Warm climate with British colonial background made foreigners easy to interact with the locals.|$|E
