5|$|The {{well-developed}} compound {{eyes were}} stalked. The striking morphological similarities {{of the eyes}} of Waptia fieldensis to that of extant mysid shrimp make it very likely that they were capable of producing true visual images or were at least sensitive to motion. A median eye may have also been present. Nervous tissue, including a putative <b>brain,</b> <b>has</b> been identified.|$|E

5|$|As of 2017, {{just under}} 20,000 protein-coding genes {{are seen to}} be {{expressed}} in the human, and some 400 of these genes are brain-specific. The data that has been provided on gene expression in the <b>brain</b> <b>has</b> fuelled further research {{into a number of}} disorders. The long term use of alcohol for example, has shown altered gene expression in the brain, and cell-type specific changes that may relate to alcohol use disorder. These changes have been noted in the synaptic transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex, and are seen as a factor causing the drive to alcohol dependence, and also to other substance abuses.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales have a {{relatively}} small brain compared to their body mass. Like other mammals, their <b>brain</b> <b>has</b> a large, folded cerebrum, {{the part of the}} brain responsible for memory and processing sensory information. Their cerebrum only makes up about 68% of their brain's weight, as opposed to human's 83%. The cerebellum, {{the part of the brain}} responsible for balance and coordination, makes up 18% of their brain's weight, compared to 10% in humans, which is probably due to the great degree of control necessary for constantly swimming. Necropsies on the brains of gray whales revealed iron oxide particles, which may allow them to find magnetic north like a compass.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral veins drain deoxygenated {{blood from}} the brain. The <b>brain</b> <b>has</b> two main {{networks}} of veins: an exterior or superficial network, {{on the surface of}} the cerebrum that has three branches, and an interior network. These two networks communicate via anastomosing (joining) veins. The veins of the brain drain into larger cavities the dural venous sinuses usually situated between the dura mater and the covering of the skull. Blood from the cerebellum and midbrain drains into the great cerebral vein. Blood from the medulla and pons of the brainstem have a variable pattern of drainage, either into the spinal veins or into adjacent cerebral veins.|$|E

5|$|Fighters such as Bob Probert and Boogaard {{have been}} posthumously {{diagnosed}} with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative {{disease of the}} brain caused by repeated brain trauma. While the NHL took steps to limit head trauma from blindslide hits, it was criticized for doing nothing to reduce fighting, which consists of repeated deliberate blows to the head. It is unknown if Boogaard's death was mainly attributed from his repeated head trauma from fighting and hits or from a possible addiction to painkillers while simultaneously abusing alcohol. His <b>brain</b> <b>has</b> been sent to Boston University for further testing.|$|E
5|$|The human <b>brain</b> <b>has</b> many {{properties}} {{that are common}} to all vertebrate brains, and shares many features common to all mammalian brains, most notably a six-layered cerebral cortex {{and a set of}} associated structures, including the hippocampus and amygdala. The cortex is proportionally larger in greater mammals and humans than many other animals. Humans have more association cortex, sensory and motor parts than other mammals such as the rat and the cat.|$|E
5|$|Synapses {{are the key}} {{functional}} elements of the brain. The essential function of the brain is cell-to-cell communication, and synapses are the points at which communication occurs. The human <b>brain</b> <b>has</b> been estimated to contain approximately 100 trillion synapses; even the brain of a fruit fly contains several million. The functions of these synapses are very diverse: some are excitatory (exciting the target cell); others are inhibitory; others work by activating second messenger systems that change the internal chemistry of their target cells in complex ways. A large number of synapses are dynamically modifiable; that is, {{they are capable of}} changing strength {{in a way that is}} controlled by the patterns of signals that pass through them. It is widely believed that activity-dependent modification of synapses is the brain's primary mechanism for learning and memory.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{entering}} Philo's penthouse suite, Lenny finds another SQUID disc and Philo's {{body on the}} floor, whose <b>brain</b> <b>has</b> {{been damaged}} {{in the same manner}} as Tick's. After watching the disc, Lenny discovers that Max and Faith have become lovers and that they forced Philo to run an amplified recording of them having sex. Max and Faith then enter the room, explaining that they set Philo up because he wanted to have Faith killed for what she knew about Jeriko's death, and that he now intends to frame Lenny for Philo's murder. After a hand-to-hand fight, Lenny throws Max off the balcony to his death. Meanwhile, on the street, Mace is pursued by Steckler and Engelman, but she manages to subdue them with the help of Strickland, who saw the proof behind Jeriko's death. Lenny then finds Mace and the two share a passionate kiss as the crowd celebrates the turn of the new century around them.|$|E
5|$|Having {{vowed to}} end Delilah's {{experiments}} with the dead, Cain solves murders while periodically running into Jizabel {{and other members}} of Delilah. After encountering Mikaila, who professes her one-sided love for him and wants to become Suzette, he becomes obsessed with destroying the organization and learns that it is secretly building a memorial temple. Meanwhile, despite Jizabel's efforts to delay Riff's second, hidden, and cruel personality from awakening, the hypnosis suppressing it breaks. Riff later declares to Cain that he secretly works for Delilah: the loyal, kind-hearted Riff Cain had known is an alternative personality used to deceive others. Alexis had intended for Cain to develop a close bond with Riff, only to break it, to remind Cain that he is unloved. After Riff's departure, Cain resolves to confront Alexis and promises Mary that they will have a tea party after the conflict with Delilah ends. Led by Cassian, whose <b>brain</b> <b>has</b> been transplanted into an adult body, he reaches the tower within the temple where Alexis plans to sacrifice the brainwashed people of London to revive Augusta. Within the tower, Riff reveals his intent to overthrow Alexis. Unconcerned, Alexis divulges that Riff is Delilah's longest surviving doll and will soon die. Riff attacks Cain, but Riff's other personality resurfaces, causing him to deliberately shoot himself. Riff's loyal personality triumphs over the cruel one, but he and Cain are separated. Because Riff's wound cannot heal, Jizabel commits suicide so Riff can use his blood to briefly remain alive and return to Cain. Meanwhile, Cain successfully poisons his father and with his death, the tower begins to crumble. Cain, unable to escape and hurt by the falling debris, reunites briefly with Riff. However, the ceiling collapses and Riff tries to push him away. Cain embraces him, choosing to stay.|$|E
5|$|The {{actor and}} {{presenter}} Bob Holness {{lived in the}} town {{as a child and}} attended Herne Bay Primary School until moving to Ashford. Nicki Chapman, the judge on the UK television series Popstars and Pop Idol, {{was born and raised in}} the town. Originally from London, Daniel Tammet, the subject of the UK documentary The Boy with the Incredible <b>Brain,</b> <b>has</b> now moved to the town. He is an autistic savant with outstanding abilities in mathematics, sequence memorising and language learning. Lydia Cecilia Hill (1913â€“1940), known as Cissie Hill, lived at Westcliff; she was a favourite of Ibrahim of Johor and former dancer. The Yorkshire-born writer Will Scott lived and wrote in Herne Bay until his death in 1964. During the late 1960s, many successful rock and jazz bands were formed around the city of Canterbury, creating a subgenre of music known as the Canterbury sound. Some of these musicians were residents of Herne Bay, including Dave Sinclair and Richard Coughlan of Caravan, and Kevin Ayers of Soft Machine. George W. M. Reynolds, one of the most popular British authors of the early Victorian era, moved to Herne Bay in 1854 and became one of the town's Improvement Commissioners. The children's writer Evelyn Whitaker was born there in 1844. HÃ©ctor GarcÃ­a Ribeyro, the Mayor of Lima in Peru during the 1950s, had part of his schooling at the now defunct Herne Bay International school. Colin Dixon, the depot manager held hostage with his family during the Â£53million Securitas depot robbery of February 2006, lived in Herne Bay at the time.|$|E
