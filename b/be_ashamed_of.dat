5|$|General Horace Warfield is put {{in command}} of the Dominion forces to fight the second Zerg invasion, in Wings of Liberty. He served in the Confederate {{military}} under Arcturus Mengsk, and held a higher place among Mengsk's advisors than Edmund Duke, who also abandoned the confederacy. His entire family was killed during the Zerg assault on Tarsonis due {{to the use of the}} psi-emitters, about which Warfield is rumoured to have provided extremely valuable intelligence. In , Warfield is defeated by Kerrigan and tells her to let the transports full of wounded troops leave the planet alive, calling her a traitor to humanity and stating that Raynor would <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> her. Kerrigan, furious at the general's comments, executes him but allows the transports to escape.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Ava {{is asked}} to be the grand marshal to a New Year's Day parade. This makes her boyfriend, Kevin, feel like he can't live up to her lifestyle. He then starts {{thinking}} she may <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> him, especially after he isn't invited to sit with her during the parade. Eventually, Kevin confronts Ava on this and she reveals that if she messes up their relationship she doesn't wanted {{to be reminded of}} it while Googling her name. He assures her that their relationship won't end badly and the two go to the parade.|$|E

5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{decides to}} start {{painting}} her mural in the warehouse, {{but has a}} hard time getting started as she is afraid of it not being perfect. Meanwhile, bored with having to fill out customer complaint cards (which he finds redundant because the complaints are already in the computer), Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) uses them to build a card tower in the annex with other employees. The card tower takes on a deeper meaning for the employees when Pete points out that it is composed of failures made by every one of them (excepting only Pam), and thus proves that they should not <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> their failures. They decide {{to try to make it}} go all the way to the ceiling, but end up one complaint card short. Not wanting to use a blank card as it would defy the point of the tower, Pam offers to complete the tower by getting her first customer complaint. She calls one of their smaller clients, delivers a yo mama joke, and hangs up. The client, whose mother was actually obese and is now deceased, drops Dunder Mifflin as their paper supplier, leaving them simultaneously excited over getting that last complaint and disappointed over losing a client. After celebrating the completion of the card tower, Pam finally starts painting the mural, saying artists should not care too much in what others think, further asserting this by telling off Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) when he insults her artwork.|$|E
25|$|Ted {{carries a}} war injury that causes him ongoing {{physical}} and mental pain. While he cannot speak {{of his time in}} the Cavalry, Rose shows Albert his father's medals from the Second Boer War that he earned for bravery under fire. She gives Albert his father's regimental pennant, telling Albert that his father felt shame over what he did during the war, and that he had thrown the flag and medals away, though Rose saved and kept them hidden. Albert does not understand why Ted would <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> having fought in a war.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Sorge's {{reputation}} in West Germany in the 1950s {{was a highly}} negative one, with Sorge depicted as a traitor working for the Soviet Union {{who was responsible for}} the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Wehrmacht soldiers in the winter of 1941-42. The 1950s were a transition moment in the German memory of Nazi Germany as those Germans who had supported the Third Reich sought a version of history that presented them as victims rather than as followers of Hitler, portrayed Nazism as an aberration in German history that had no connections to traditional Prussian values, portrayed the Wehrmacht as an honorable fighting force that had nothing to do with the Holocaust, and presented the Soviets as guilty of crimes that even more horrific than those committed by the Nazis. Given this way of remembering the Nazi past in the 1950s, Operation Barbarossa and Germany's war in the East were seen as a heroic and legitimate war against the Soviet Union that Germans should not <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of.</b>|$|E

500|$|On 20 October 2010, {{following}} a live BBC News at Six report outside Parliament covering the 2010 Spending Review, Robinson silently took the anti-war, anti-cuts placard {{that had been}} waved directly behind him throughout, broke it in two and stamped on it. Afterwards, another protester, who had climbed {{the steps of the}} gantry where the BBC were broadcasting to film the protest on a mobile phone, said: [...] "You should <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> yourself, mate. Shame on you!" [...] Robinson replied [...] "I'm not remotely ashamed of myself. Why should I <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> myself?" [...] He wrote in his blog afterwards: [...] "I lost my temper and I regret that. However, as I explained afterwards to the protesters who disrupted my broadcast, there are many opportunities to debate whether the troops should be out of Afghanistan without the need to stick a sign on a long pole and wave it in front of a camera". Some days later, Robinson read out a jokily ambiguous [...] "letter of apology" [...] on the comedy game show Have I Got News for You, broadcast on 4 November 2010.|$|E

500|$|According to US Attorney Donald Washington, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{investigators}} {{found that the}} hanging of the nooses [...] "had all the markings of a hate crime". But, {{it could not be}} prosecuted as such since juveniles are rarely prosecuted in the federal system, and this offense did not meet departmental standards for charges to be brought. La Salle Parish District Attorney J. Reed Walters stated that Washington had found no federal statute under which the teens could be prosecuted, just as he had found no applicable state statute. Walters opined: [...] "The people that [...] should <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> what they unleashed on this town." ...|$|E
500|$|Additional {{controversy}} developed {{after the}} battle about Pickett's personal location during the charge. The fact that fifteen of his officers and all three of his brigadier generals were casualties while Pickett managed to escape unharmed led many to question his proximity to the fighting and, by implication, his personal courage. The 1993 film Gettysburg depicts him observing on horseback from the Codori Farm at the Emmitsburg Road, {{but there is no}} historical evidence to confirm this. It was established doctrine in the Civil War that commanders of divisions and above would [...] "lead from the rear", while brigade and more junior officers were expected to lead from the front, and while this was often violated, there was nothing for Pickett to <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> if he coordinated his forces from behind.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} after the 1918 Armistice, Pankhurst {{continued}} to promote her nationalist vision of British unity. She maintained a focus on women's empowerment, but her days of fighting with government officialdom were over. She defended the presence and reach of the British Empire: [...] "Some talk about the Empire and Imperialism {{as if it were}} something to decry and something to <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of.</b> t is a great thing to be the inheritors of an Empire like ours... great in territory, great in potential wealth.... If we can only realise and use that potential wealth we can destroy thereby poverty, we can remove and destroy ignorance." [...] For years she travelled around England and North America, rallying support for the British Empire and warning audiences about the dangers of Bolshevism.|$|E
