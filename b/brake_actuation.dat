50|$|B6 S4 brakes {{consisted}} of radially ventilated disc brakes front and rear. The front discs are sized at 345 mm in diameter by 30 mm thick, and are clamped by Continental Teves-ATE FNRG-60 single-piston sliding brake calipers. The rears are 300 mm by 22 mm, and again use single-piston sliding calipers, with an integrated cable-operated hand brake mechanism. A Bosch ESP 5.7 Electronic Stability Programme system, complete with Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), Emergency Brake Assist (EBA), Electronic Differential Lock (EDL) and Anti-Slip Regulation (ASR) - {{also known as}} traction control system, coupled with a dual-rate tandem vacuum servo provided the <b>brake</b> <b>actuation.</b>|$|E
50|$|A key {{safety feature}} was a novel braking system that {{consisted}} of an automotive disc brakes attached to the vehicles driveshafts. These brakes were held off by hydraulic pressure that was present whenever the vehicle was connected with guideway power and the on-board controller was commanding them off. In the event of loss of electrical power, the hydraulic pressure holding the brakes was lost and springs inside the cylinders forced brake fluid into the calipers of the disc braking system, ensuring that the vehicles did not simply coast to a stop. In order to provide for a controlled deceleration, a pendulum valve was located {{in line with the}} <b>brake</b> <b>actuation</b> cylinders. Pendulums inside the valve reacted to the deceleration profile of the vehicle and would partially close, reducing the pressure in the brake lines and moderating the deceleration so that the emergency stop was not dangerously abrupt.|$|E
5000|$|The Bugatti Type 32, {{commonly}} called the Tank de Tours, was a streamlined racing car built in 1923. Four examples were made, {{each with a}} 2.0 L (1991 cc/121 in³) straight-8 engine based on that in the Type 30. [...] "The Tank" [...] {{finished third in the}} ACF Grand Prix that year. This was the first Bugatti to be fitted with roller-bearing big ends in order to improve the bottom-end reliability (Bugatti was rather later than most manufacturers in the incorporation of a fully pressurised oil system, preferring a splash [...] "spit and hope" [...] delivery method). The Type 32 also broke new ground (for a racing Bug) by using a three-speed and reverse transaxle unit, the exceptionally short wheelbase and long straight-8 engine making a conventional gearbox difficult to accommodate. It also heralded an hydraulic front <b>brake</b> <b>actuation.</b> Another tank-bodied Bugatti racer, the 1936 Type 57G, was much more successful.|$|E

30|$|The {{correlation}} between the wear behavior of a heavy commercial vehicle (HCV) brake liner tested under controlled laboratory conditions and that in actual field conditions is investigated. A brake liner study for friction and wear is performed on an inertia brake dynamometer (IBD) at different temperatures (200 °C, 250 °C, and 300 °C) using 6000 <b>brake</b> <b>actuations</b> in a laboratory. The total wear loss of the brake liner at three different temperatures for 6000 <b>brake</b> <b>actuations</b> in IBD {{is found to be}} 1.12 mm. The actual field test is conducted on four different HCVs, namely, a city bus (CB), a high speed bus (HSB), a highway truck (HWT), and a tipper lorry (TL). These HCVs run at different terrain/traffic conditions and load conditions. When comparing the predicted life of the brake liner through the IBD test with the actual life of the brake liner in different HCVs, a vast difference is observed. Due to the large variation of liner life observed between the actual and predicted tests, an extensive field test is conducted. In the field test, the liner with identical formulation is fitted in the four types of HCVs. The predicted life of the liner using IBD is then correlated with the field test observation and a correlation factor is determined. Based on this correlation factor, the predicted life of the liner and the achieved life on the HCV are found to be fairly close. This study will be useful to design the friction material formulation and to predict the actual life of the brake liner for various HCVs.|$|R

40|$|In the {{development}} of advanced chassis systems, the interaction of different active systems and their combined influence on the behaviour of the vehicle need to be closely examined. In order to optimally use the safety and comfort potentials such systems can provide, interferences must be avoided and synergetic effects need to be used. While the demand for shorter development cycles and a reduction of development costs is growing, the use of computer simulation provides a powerful means to obtain reliable results early in {{the development}} of active chassis systems. One property of most active chassis systems is the possibility to influence the vehicle’s handling characteristics. Common to all these systems is the generation of yaw moments around the vertical axis of the vehicle. Such systems are e. g., active steering, active four wheel drive, active roll controll, and individual wheel <b>brake</b> <b>actuation.</b> Depending on the driving situation, the possible influence of these systems upon driving dynamics differs greatly and simultaneous interventions of different systems can lead to both interferences and synergies...|$|E

Chapter 2 presents simulation results of various <b>brake</b> <b>actuation</b> events on articulated vehicles with path following control. It is shown that the vehicle is stable under braking with path following control provided the Anti-lock Braking System is functioning. Active trailer steering can compensate the changing direction of trailer body caused by the braking forces and thus maintain the vehicle’s yaw stability. Chapter 3 and 4 present a strategy for estimating vehicle parameters and states. Chapter 5 develops an optimal active trailer steering controller at high speeds and a PID controller at low speeds. Simulations show that the active trailer steering controller can reduce lateral acceleration significantly, while maintaining acceptable path error. The active steering vehicle improves the roll stability by reducing the lateral acceleration of trailer CoG up to 27 % while maintaining path tracking performance {{as good as a}} passive vehicle at high speeds.

40|$|Invited talk at Google Self-Driving Cars, Mountain View, May 12 th 2015 Modern cars {{include more}} and more {{sophisticated}} electronics, sensors, processing and control components. These new components are used both for controlling the main functions of the vehicle and for providing the driver with Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS). Such ADAS functionalities are increasingly based on Robotics technologies for partly automating some driving functions such as adaptive cruise control, acceleration/braking in a traffic lane, lane keeping, parking assistance, or even simple collision avoidance or mitigation actions (including <b>braking</b> or airbag <b>actuation).</b> Most of the automotive constructors are now proposing ADAS options, {{and the degree of}} autonomy of cars is progressively increasing. But the ultimate challenge addressed by many Academic and Industrial Research Laboratories is the development of driverless cars. Impressive results have already been published and largely disseminated through the media, and manyannouncements concerning the future deployment of such vehicles have been done by most of the major Automotive Manufacturers and by multinational groups such as Google. This talk addresses both the socio-economic and technical issues which are behind the development of the next cars generation. These future cars will include both smart ADAS and Driverless Car functionalities. In the talk, an emphasis will be put on three main enablingtechnologies: (1) Robust Multi-sensors Embedded Perception system, (2) Situation Awareness & Collision Risk assessment in complex traffic situations, and (3) Decisional and Control System for generating safe Navigation and Maneuvering actions. All theses functionalities have to be robust in the presence of sensing errors, uncertainty and traffic hazards.

40|$|Abstract：The {{full power}} {{hydraulic}} brake system has several advantages over traditional <b>brake</b> <b>actuation</b> systems. These systems {{are capable of}} supplying fluid {{to a range of}} very small and large volume service brakes with actuation that is faster than air/hydraulic brake systems. Implementation of full power hydraulic brake system in off-road vehicles calls for good understanding of its dynamic characteristics. In this paper, we consider the problem of dynamic modeling of the brake system and develop a dynamic model for a hydraulic brake valve. First, the dynamic characteristics of full power hydraulic brake system are analyzed theoretically. The effects of varying design parameters (brake valve, accumulator and so on) and the different operating conditions are then analyzed. Second, we investigate the dynamic characteristics of a full power hydraulic brake system using a test bench, which is a loader brake system specifically designed for one construction Machinery Company. Finally, based on the experimental results, the mathematical models are amended and verified. The result shows that the model-calculated data agree well with tested data. The dynamic behavior of hydraulic valve can be well predicted with the model. The simplified models {{can be applied to the}} studies of full power hydraulic brake system dynamics...|$|E

Reviews of the relevant characteristics of the motorcyclists and drivers, and of the motorcycles, are also included. The role of road and traffic factors is discussed in more detail in a separate report in this series. Sixty-eight, or 22 per cent of the accidents in this survey involved a motorcycle. Most of the riders were young males, many of whom were inexperienced in riding a motorcycle in traffic, and alcohol intoxication was a major factor in those accidents which occurred at night. Few riders were able to make full use of the braking capabilities of their motorcycle in an emergency, and changes are recommended in the method of <b>brake</b> <b>actuation</b> and in motorcycle licence tests. Ninety-six per cent of the motorcyclists were injured. Severe head injuries were less common than were severe injuries to the lower limbs, reflecting the use of effective crash helmets and the high risk of the motorcyclist being struck on the leg in a collision.

40|$|Early {{research}} suggests that, in a simulated train-driving environment, unskilled, novice drivers may exhibit comparable behaviour and performance to experienced, professional train drivers after receiving only minimal, task-specific training. However, {{this conclusion is}} based on exiguous performance indicators, such as speed limit exceedances, SPAD violations etc., and considers only limited data. This paper presents further, detailed analysis of driving performance data obtained from 20 drivers (13 novices and 7 experienced train drivers), {{who took part in}} a previous simulator-based research study, utilising more sensitive and perspicuous measures, namely acceleration noise and control actuation. Results indicate that, although both cohorts exhibited similar performance using the original metrics, and would thus support the same conclusions, the manner in which this performance was effected is fundamentally different between groups. Trained novice drivers (mainly comprising students and staff at the University of Nottingham) adopted far more erratic speed control profiles, characterised by longer control actions and frequent switching between power and <b>brake</b> <b>actuation.</b> In contrast, experienced drivers delivered smoother acceleration/braking profiles with more subtle (and shorter) control actions and less variance in speed. We conclude that although utilising trained non-drivers may offer an appealing solution in the absence of professional train drivers during simulator-based research, and their input remains of value, researchers should remain mindful when interpreting results and drawing conclusions from a contingent comprising non-drivers. The work also demonstrates the value of dependent variables such as acceleration noise, and quantitative measures of control actuation, which may offer an insightful portfolio of measures in train driving research studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{automotive}} {{brake system}} plays {{a significant role}} not only in the deceleration and stopping process, but also in many stability control strategies. To overcome the limitations of conventional brake systems and to improve vehicle control strategies such as traction control, and differential braking, a new generation of brake systems called the brake-by-wire system has been introduced to the vehicle industry. This generation of brake systems combines electrical, mechanical and, in some cases, hydraulic components. Although different types of brake-by-wire mechanisms have been developed in the past two decades, there still exist demands for further improvement and developing new brake mechanisms in the automotive industry due to the ever increasing demand for better safety and performance. This research proposes a novel brake-by-wire system based on cam actuation. This system is a combination of electrical, mechanical and hydraulic components. The unique feature of the cam <b>actuation</b> <b>brake</b> system proposed in this research is that the characteristics of the motor torque amplification can be optimized by careful design of the cam shape. The compactness and self-contained characteristic of the design allow the brake system to be installed on each wheel enabling fully independent control of each wheel for better stability control. Moreover, the cam actuated brake has a fail-safe advantage by keeping the direct connection between the driver and the brake calipers in case of any system failure. In this work, different subsystems of the brake system and their components are explained, the dynamic model of the system is found and the design parameters are optimized. Specifically, the optimal design problem has been formulated by taking the geometry of the cam as the optimization variable and the open-loop response time of the brake system as the objective function to be minimized. The solution to this problem is then obtained by the multi-layer design optimization process using the genetic algorithm (GA). Various control algorithms are applied to the developed cam actuated brake system to investigate their performance in terms of tracking a desired braking pressure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSilicon carbide (SiC) power devices {{can operate}} at much higher {{temperature}} than their silicon counterparts. This enabled {{the design of}} power electronics converters for environments in which the ambient temperature can reach or exceed 200 °C. For example, jet engine controls or <b>brake</b> <b>actuation</b> for aircrafts, or the down-hole converters for geothermal or gas exploration. Another way of taking advantage of this high junction temperature capability of SiC devices is to save on their thermal management system: using a less efficient (but smaller and lighter) cooling system, and let the junction temperature reach elevated levels, even with a moderated ambient temperature. As a seminconducting material, SiC can in theory operate up to 1000 °C. Many additional limitations, however, {{must be taken into}} account : melting of the contact metalizations, degradation of the secondary passivation layer [...] . Furthermore, for unipolar devices, the thermal run-away phenomenon must be considered: with these devices, the conduction losses increase dramatically with their junction temperature. At some point, they can exceed the cooling capability of the associated thermal management system, and the device becomes unstable. To build a functional converter, many other aspects must be investigated: passive devices, gate drivers, packaging [...] . High temperature has a strong influence on the converter design, as not all technologies are compatible with this requirement: very few capacitors or encapsulating materials can be found to operate above 200 °C. For more ambitious goals (more than 250 °C), the design alternatives are even fewer. In many cases, the increase in the maximum operating temperature is associated with wider temperature swings (e. g. for aircraft applications, the ambient temperature can go from - 55 °C to more than 200 °C). This increased thermal cycling generates higher mechanical stresses in the packaging (because of the difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion between the various materials of the package). This has a detrimental consequence on reliability...|$|E
