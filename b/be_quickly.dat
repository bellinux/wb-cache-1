5|$|Following District Judge Earnest Lau's {{ruling in}} the Odex v. Pacific Internet lawsuit, Koshy {{expressed}} {{his belief that}} SingNet might be in breach {{of the spirit of}} the Telecommunications Competition Code, which protects the confidentiality of subscribers' information and prohibits unauthorised release. Another lawyer interviewed by ZDNet, however, did not think that SingNet's actions were improper, and a spokesman for the Infocomm Development Authority announced that SingNet was found to be in compliance with the code. Andy Ho, another The Straits Times editor, expressed concern that private entities might use intellectual property laws invasively, thus precipitating a chilling effect on free speech; he called for privacy laws to <b>be</b> <b>quickly</b> enacted.|$|E

5|$|Once air-to-air combat began over North Vietnam, the Air Force {{was again}} found lacking. The {{mainstay}} missiles {{of the air}} war {{turned out to be}} the Navy-developed AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow, not its own AIM-4 Falcon. The Air Force continuously opposed adapting to the war in Southeast Asia, since its leadership believed that it was an aberration that would <b>be</b> <b>quickly</b> resolved. It could then turn its attention (and its more modern weapons) against the greater threat posed by the Soviet Union. None in the Air Force high command foresaw that the war would drag on for nearly a decade.|$|E
5|$|State Senator Richard Madaleno {{requested}} in 2009 {{that the}} Attorney General {{answer the question}} of whether same-sex marriages could be recognized by the state. In February 2010, Doug Gansler issued an opinion after a nine-month analysis of state laws stating that valid same-sex marriages performed in other states that permit same-sex marriage could be recognized under Maryland law. Gansler stated that the opinion was not binding on the courts and state agencies could begin immediately to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages. He said that he expected the opinion to <b>be</b> <b>quickly</b> challenged in court.|$|E
5|$|The Basin gates contain many sluices, so {{water can}} <b>be</b> <b>quickly</b> drained out or let in {{according}} to whether the sea level is above or below the prevailing docks water level but more water is lost from No.1 dock supply if the Basin water is lowered to the seaward side of the lock gates instead of using the Lady Windsor lock sluices.

5|$|The P90 can {{be fitted}} with a sling for greater ease of carry, and since the weapon has a fixed stock (as opposed to having a {{collapsing}} or folding stock), it can <b>be</b> <b>quickly</b> deployed when needed. The weapon's smooth, rounded contours prevent it from snagging on the shooter's clothing or equipment, and a small vertical protrusion is provided at {{the front end of}} the weapon's frame to prevent the shooter's hand from accidentally slipping in front of the muzzle while shooting. A hollow compartment inside the rear of the weapon's frame—accessed by removing the buttplate—allows for convenient storage of a cleaning kit.|$|E
5|$|The South Volcanic Zone has a {{long history}} of eruptions and poses a threat to the {{surrounding}} region. Any volcanic hazard—ranging from minor ashfalls to pyroclastic flows—could pose a significant risk to humans and wildlife. Despite its inactivity, Cerro Azul could again produce a major eruption; if this were to happen, relief efforts would probably <b>be</b> <b>quickly</b> organized. Teams such as the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP) are prepared to effectively evacuate, assist, and rescue people threatened by volcanic eruptions.|$|E
5|$|The {{first months}} of Bradbury's {{directorship}} were particularly difficult.

It {{soon became clear that}} this would take more than six months. President Harry S. Truman did not sign the act creating the Atomic Energy Commission into law until 1 August 1946, and it did not become active until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, Groves' legal authority to act was limited.|$|E

5|$|The rampant and {{unsustainable}} hunting was {{not just}} financially motivated: it also had a more philosophical, fatalistic aspect. The conventional wisdom among New Zealand Europeans in the 19th century was that things colonial, whether they were plants, animals or people, were inferior to things European. It was widely assumed that the plants and animals of New Zealand's forest ecosystems would <b>be</b> <b>quickly</b> replaced by more vigorous and competitive European species. This assumption of inevitable doom led to a conclusion that the conservation of native biota was pointless and futile; Victorian collectors instead focused their efforts on acquiring a good range of specimens before the rare species disappeared altogether.|$|E
5|$|Vehicles {{built in}} 1940 (only) were fitted with {{removable}} loading ramps, cable rollers {{to act as}} pulleys, and a reinforced tail gate to allow a Flak 30, mounted on a Sd.Ah. 51 trailer, to <b>be</b> <b>quickly</b> dismounted. From 1940 they were fitted with rifle racks over the front fenders and from 1942 these were given sheet metal covers as protection from the weather. Flak 38s were mounted on 10/4s beginning in 1941 although the platform wasn't widened until later. As the war progressed the guns were more often fitted with gun shields.|$|E
5|$|By the 1330s, Southampton's {{prosperity}} {{was in a}} slow decline. In 1338 {{there was}} a successful French attack on the town, during which various buildings were burned and castle was damaged. The house {{may have been one}} of those damaged in the raid, as the south-western corner of the building collapsed around that time and had to <b>be</b> <b>quickly</b> rebuilt; other alterations, including the addition of a fireplace, may have been carried out at the same time. Southampton's economy collapsed {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks and never fully recovered. The character of FrenchStreet began to change, as many houses were sub-divided or redeveloped to fit in more buildings. The Medieval Merchant's House ceased to be used by major merchants and by 1392 appears to have been rented out to tenants by Thomas Fryke and John Barflet, the latter a descendent of John Fortin, for whom the house was originally built.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{aforementioned}} balance issues, {{the game was}} initially very difficult, especially in the later stages. Nakamura had written a program that simulated every single combat {{that he used to}} adjust the games setting for character leveling and the strength of enemies players would encounter. This program failed to account for larger monster groups, however, which fell outside the model and caused the game to be very difficult. Further more, enemies leveling and weapons power were designed by area, but Koichi Nakamura didn't think over the boat, so if player get the boat to some land might <b>be</b> <b>quickly</b> killed. The developers realized there was a balance problem and did some modifications, such as limiting the number of enemies in Midenhall to groups of three, and moving the Cannock Castle closer to Midenhall Castle.|$|E
5|$|Each {{battery-powered}} vehicle, or AGV, {{is made up}} of two platforms. Riders sit on {{the upper}} platform, which provides three degrees of freedom. A lower platform provides omnidirectional lateral movement. Unlike previous ride designs, the trackless system and the wheel and motor configurations allow movements diagonal to a rider's perspective. The vehicles use a dead reckoning system developed by Frog AGV to navigate their way through the environment, allowing a vehicle to cross another's path. Each vehicle features a built-in controller, which wirelessly communicates with a central ride-system controller. Movement commands are issued by the ride-system controller, and executed by the vehicles' controllers. A specially-designed battery and charge system allow the vehicles to <b>be</b> <b>quickly</b> charged while docked at the loading and unloading platforms.|$|E
5|$|In 1950 Hicks {{and other}} women based on the East coast of the United States began meeting in an organization, the goal of which was to advance female {{engineers}} and increase female participation in engineering. The organization was incorporated as the Society of Women Engineers two years later. Hicks served {{as the president of}} the organization for two consecutive terms, from 1950 to 1952. In 1963 the Society of Women Engineers presented their highest honor, the Society of Women Engineers Achievement Award, to Hicks. Hicks toured the United States, championing the cause of female engineers through outreach and speaking engagements. She believed that while female engineers would initially be closely watched, they would also <b>be</b> <b>quickly</b> accepted.|$|E

5|$|In November 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy, {{which had}} {{oversight}} over the reactor in Oak Ridge, allowed the scientific {{use of the}} extracted berkelium. The production lasted 250 days and ended in late December 2008, resulting in 22milligrams of berkelium, enough to perform the experiment. In January 2009, the berkelium was removed from ORNL’s High Flux Isotope Reactor; it was subsequently cooled for 90 days and then processed at ORNL’s Radiochemical Engineering and Development Center to separate and purify the berkelium material, which took another 90 days. Its half-life is only 330days: after that time, half the berkelium produced would have decayed. Because of this, the berkelium target had to <b>be</b> <b>quickly</b> transported to Russia; for the experiment to be viable, {{it had to be}} completed within six months of its departure from the United States. The target was packed into five lead containers to be flown from New York to Moscow.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, {{as the price}} of silver rose, Treasury Department vaults were {{depleted}} of silver dollars by the public. No silver dollars had been minted in the United States since 1935, and a shortage developed in the Western United States, especially in areas in which gambling was common. As a result, Congress voted to authorize production of 45 million new silver Peace dollars on August 3, 1964. However, the move drew strong condemnation from critics who believed that the issuance of the coins was influenced by special interests, and that they would <b>be</b> <b>quickly</b> removed from circulation. The dollars were subsequently melted, and the Coinage Act of 1965, enacted on July 23, 1965, forbade all production of dollar coins for a period of five years.|$|E
5|$|In the east, the North Koreans {{advanced}} {{immediately after}} taking Taejon. Four North Korean divisions split up {{and approached the}} UN lines along separate routes. The NK 15th Division {{was the first to}} move against the US 25th Infantry in the Battle of Sangju on July 20, where the division's US 24th Infantry would <b>be</b> <b>quickly</b> pushed back by the North Korean advance. In the meantime, the NK 3rd Division engaged the newly arrived US 1st Cavalry at the Battle of Yongdong on July 22, where that division would also perform poorly. The NK 6th Division moved further south, where it would confront the US 29th Infantry Regiment at the Hadong Ambush on July 27, effectively destroying one of the regiment's battalions. The US units were performing extremely poorly in their first engagements against North Korean units, as a combination of shortages of supplies and lack of experienced soldiers and officers plagued the UN forces {{at this stage of the}} war.|$|E
