50|$|Block B {{is a high}} set timber framed {{building}} {{supported on}} steel open web joists with a cantilevered portion supporting the verandah. Stairs at the eastern and western ends provide access to a narrow verandah on the northern {{side of the building}} which contains a continuous hat and <b>bag</b> <b>rack</b> and provides access to the three classrooms. This building is of a type of which there are numerous examples, several of which are more comparatively intact and which represent a more extensive use of this type of structure.|$|E
50|$|The Chrysler Pacifica was {{a concept}} luxury minivan created by DaimlerChrysler under the Chrysler marque in 1999. The Pacifica {{was built in}} {{commemoration}} of the Chrysler minivan's 15th anniversary and {{was intended to be}} a more upscale variant of the Town & Country with an LHS inspired front fascia and a raised roof, which included a skylight and overhead storage bins. It could seat up to six, with four front and rear captain's chairs and fold-out jump seats on each of the rear seats. The 2nd row seats featured power footrests. The concept also had a golf <b>bag</b> <b>rack</b> in the trunk space that could hold up to four golf bags.|$|E
5000|$|The Neighbor was {{designed}} to meet the NHTSA specification for Neighborhood Electric Vehicles. Design and manufacture was unrelated to the Th!nk City. The Neighbor was initially offered in two models, a two-seater and a four-seater, with a two-passenger utility truck version offered near the end of production. The TH!NK Neighbor had a fixed roof over an open enclosure; a rain cover was optionally available to protect the passengers from the elements. The normal top speed was governored to 25 mph per NHTSA requirements, and it also had a [...] "turf" [...] mode that set its maximum speed at 15 mph for golf course use. Many options were designed for use on the golf course: it featured a <b>bag</b> <b>rack,</b> a holder for scorecards, tees, and balls, and a club washer. Additionally, there was a trunk option for the four-passenger version that could double as a cooler.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bag</b> <b>racks</b> as {{verandah}} balustrades {{became a}} characteristic design element of Queensland schools after World War II and this occurred generally at Bowen State School. As {{a result of}} the changes in education philosophies and consistent with the alterations of other schools across the state, many of the buildings at Bowen State School had their fenestration altered {{to increase the amount of}} light into the classrooms, and many older windows were replaced with modern awning style windows.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper level}} {{verandah}} runs {{the length of}} the northern side providing access to south-facing classrooms. The verandah is enclosed with aluminium-framed sliding windows, has a balustrade of <b>bag</b> <b>racks,</b> and a raked ceiling lined with sheet material and rounded cover strips. The verandah wall of the western portion retains chamferboard lining and banks of original timber-framed, double-hung sash windows with pivot-hung fanlights (all with original hardware), but modern doors. The verandah wall of the eastern portion has been altered by the insertion of large openings, removing all windows and doors.|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} method the spat or seed may {{be put in}} <b>racks,</b> <b>bags,</b> or cages (or they may be glued in threes to {{vertical}} ropes) which are held above the bottom. Oysters cultivated in this manner may be harvested by lifting the <b>bags</b> or <b>racks</b> {{to the surface and}} removing mature oysters, or simply retrieving the larger oysters when the enclosure is exposed at low tide. The latter method may avoid losses to some predators, but is more expensive.|$|R
50|$|Block E as {{moved to}} Bowen State School 1930-31 (former {{technical}} college/high top) {{and is not}} a standard type. Block E retains important fabric that identifies it as an individually-designed technical educational building from the 1910s. It is a rectangular high-set, timber-framed building with a gabled hip roof and a verandah on the eastern and southern sides. The external walls are clad with weatherboards and the roof with corrugated metal sheeting. The eastern verandah ceiling is lined with timber v-jointed boards. An area of more recent lining indicates the position of a now- removed entry gable. Timber verandah posts and scalloped timber valance are original. At {{the southern end of the}} verandah is an intact hat room from the 1930-31 conversion for High Top use. The verandah balustrade is a later <b>bag</b> <b>rack</b> form. The building does not retain original windows or doors. The interior retains its original technical college layout with internal partitions dividing the space into classrooms accessible from the verandah. The walls and coved ceilings are lined with v-jointed tongue and groove timber boards. Timber roof framing beams are exposed within the classrooms.|$|E
50|$|Identified as {{standard}} type D/T1, Sectional School Block A retains important fabric that identifies it {{as a standard}} Sectional School type. It is a long, narrow, timber-framed building, high-set, with a western verandah and a gable roof. The walls are clad with weatherboards and the roof with corrugated metal sheeting. The verandah has a balustrade of <b>bag</b> <b>racks</b> and the verandah ceiling is lined with fibrous sheeting with cover strips. Verandah doors are original double leaf timber doors with original fanlights. The verandah wall has glass louvres that are not of cultural heritage significance. The eastern wall windows are sheltered by a timber hood with timber brackets and battened cheeks. The eastern windows are timber awning windows with fanlights. The fanlights are not original. The interior layout is somewhat intact with some partitions between classrooms containing later concertina doors.|$|R
50|$|Identified as {{standard}} type B/T4, Block D retains important fabric that identifies {{it as an}} 1880s Robert Ferguson design. It is a rectangular high-set, timber-framed building with a northern verandah and a gable roof. The walls are clad with weatherboards with ventilated gable ends, and the roof is clad with corrugated metal sheeting. The verandah has stop-chamfered posts and, although the roof space was not inspected, {{it is likely that}} the coved ceiling and timber roof trusses survive behind the later suspended ceiling. Important surviving evidence of the 1922 conversion of the 1884 building to reflect the Sectional School ideal are the high-set form, verandah on the northern side, windows in the southern wall (the windows themselves, not being original fabric, are not of cultural heritage significance), and the timber-framed window hood with timber brackets. The verandah has a balustrade of <b>bag</b> <b>racks</b> typical of the designs introduced in the 1950s. Formerly a single large space, the school room is partitioned into small rooms for administration use. These partitions are not of cultural heritage significance. The glass louvres in the northern verandah wall are not of cultural heritage significance.|$|R
5000|$|In 1992, Sonoco Products Company of Hartsville, SC {{patented}} the [...] "self-opening polyethylene bag stack". The main innovation of this redesign is {{that the}} removal of a <b>bag</b> from the <b>rack</b> opens the next bag in the stack. This team was headed by Wade D Fletcher and Harry Wilfong.|$|R

Then he sat down again with the inward glow of satisfaction which comes to one when one has risen successfully to a sudden emergency.|$|R
50|$|Rajapolah people, {{estimated}} population of 37,558, are noted for their traditional works, the handicrafts. They produced {{a wide range}} area of crafts, from decorative items such as wall hangings, rugs, jewelry boxes, picture frames, to functional goods, like baskets, <b>bags,</b> mats, <b>racks,</b> plates, sandals, and cushions. Their products are exported worldwide, mainly to the U.S., Europe, and some of Asia regions. Most of the artisans created their works traditionally with their hands through weaving, plaiting, and coiling, and commonly using simple and traditional equipment. Their creations are mainly made from natural materials, such as wood, bamboo, reed, cane (rattan), rush, water hyacinth, sisal fibre, ash-wood splints, jute cord, absorbent paper, pandan, mendong (straw), and other natural materials.|$|R
2500|$|W/NG [...] {{motorcycles}} were supplied from 1940 to 1945 and featured dual triangular tool boxes, pannier frames for <b>bags,</b> rear carrying <b>racks</b> and headlamp masks. [...] Rubber {{items were}} impossible to source from 1942 {{because of a}} shortage of rubber, therefore handgrips were made from canvas and footrests from steel. [...] As the war progressed, aluminium also became scarce and pressed steel {{was used for the}} primary chaincase and timing covers.|$|R
25|$|Oysters {{have been}} cultured {{for well over}} a century. The Pacific oyster (Magallana gigas) is {{presently}} the most widely grown bivalve around the world. Two methods are commonly used, release and bagging. In both cases, oysters are cultivated onshore to the size of spat, when they can attach themselves to a substrate. They may be allowed to mature further to form 'seed oysters'. In either case, they are then placed in the water to mature. The release technique involves distributing the spat throughout existing oyster beds, allowing them to mature naturally to be collected like wild oysters. Bagging has the cultivator putting spat in <b>racks</b> or <b>bags</b> and keeping them above the bottom. Harvesting involves simply lifting the <b>bags</b> or <b>rack</b> to the surface and removing the mature oysters. The latter method prevents losses to some predators, but is more expensive.|$|R
50|$|Available {{accessories}} are mudguards, {{front and}} rear folding <b>racks,</b> <b>bags,</b> lighting sets and some upmarket extra components sold in Singapore and Hong Kong, like gas suspension units. Two optional rear racks are available, the SL Carrier and the Expedition Carrier. The former mounts directly to the swingarm, and allows only {{the use of a}} rack-top bag. The latter is a folding 16mm tubular rack mounted on pivots on both the main frame and the swingarm, which allows use of small panniers (e.g. Ortlieb Front Roller) when mudguards (fenders) are fitted. The mounting pivots for this rack have only been fitted to frames since 2003. Both racks are available with rollers which allows the Birdy to roll when folded.|$|R

60|$|The {{person to}} whom she spoke, and who was {{apparently}} her husband or her brother, took down the black <b>bag</b> from the <b>rack</b> hastily, and got out the sal volatile, as my friend directed him. He poured a little into a tumbler and held it quietly to my lips. I liked his manner, as I'd liked the lady's. He was so very brotherly. Besides, there was something extremely soothing about his quick, noiseless way. He did it all so fast, yet without the faintest sign of agitation. I couldn't help thinking what a good nurse he would make; he was so rapid and effective, yet so gentle and so quiet. He seemed perfectly accustomed to the ways of nervous women.|$|R
60|$|She {{touched the}} spring of her dressing-case, and ascertained that the scent-bottle and a novel from Mudie's were both handy (the young man was {{standing}} up {{with his back to}} her, putting his <b>bag</b> in the <b>rack).</b> She would throw the scent-bottle with her right hand, she decided, and tug the communication cord with her left. She was fifty years of age, and had a son at college. Nevertheless, {{it is a fact that}} men are dangerous. She read half a column of her newspaper; then stealthily looked over the edge to decide the question of safety by the infallible test of appearance.... She would like to offer him her paper. But do young men read the Morning Post? She looked to see what he was reading--the Daily Telegraph.|$|R
60|$|At a small station near Eastleigh a {{man wearing}} a highly pleased {{expression}} on his face entered the smoking-carriage in which I was travelling to London. Putting his <b>bag</b> on the <b>rack,</b> he pulled out his pipe and threw himself back in his seat with a satisfied air; then, looking at me and catching my eye, he at once started talking. I had my newspaper, but seeing him in that overflowing mood I responded readily enough, for I was curious to know why he appeared so happy and who and what he was. Not a tradesman nor a bagman, and not a farmer, though he looked like an open-air man; nor could I form a guess from his speech and manner as to his native place. A robust man of thirty-eight or forty, with blue eyes and a Saxon face, he looked a thorough Englishman, and yet he struck me as most un-English in his lively, almost eager manner, his freedom with a stranger, and something, too, in his speech. From time to time his face lighted up, when, looking to the window, his eyes rested on some pretty scene--a glimpse of stately old elm trees in a field where cattle were grazing, of the vivid green valley of a chalk stream, the paler hills beyond, the grey church tower or spire of some tree-hidden village. When he discovered that these hills and streams and rustic villages had as great a charm for me as for himself, that I knew and loved the two or three places he named in a questioning way, he opened his heart and the secret of his present happiness.|$|R
60|$|Better, I should say, {{take the}} rapido which leaves Madrid {{three times a}} week at nine-thirty in the morning, than the night express which leaves as often at the same hour in the evening. Since there are now such good day trains on the chief Spanish lines, it is flying in the face of Providence not to go by them; they might be {{suddenly}} taken off; besides, they have excellent restaurant-cars, and there is, moreover, always the fascinating and often the memorable landscape which they pass through. By no fault of ours that I can remember, our train was rather crowded; that is, four or five out of the eight places in our corridor compartment were taken, and we were afraid at every stop that more people would get in, though I do not know that it was our anxieties kept them out. For the matter of that, I do not know why I employed an interpreter at Madrid to get my ticket stamped at the ticket-office; it required merely the presentation of the ticket at the window; but the interpreter seemed to wish it and it enabled him to practise his English with me, and I realized that he must live. In a peseta's worth of gratitude he followed us to our carriage, and he did not molest the mozo in putting our <b>bags</b> into the <b>racks,</b> though he hovered about the door till the train started; and it just now occurs to me that he may have thought a peseta was not a sufficient return for his gratitude; he had rendered us no service.|$|R
40|$|The {{cultivation}} of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, has been {{undertaken in the}} estuaries of the south west of England since the species was introduced into commercial cultivation in the UK in the 1970 s. The industry has grown slowly following improvements to legislation and environmental conditions {{and it is now}} in a position to increase production. This study has been undertaken to assess different methods of cultivation used commercially in the south west of England for growing Pacific oysters. The two methods, the growth of oysters contained in <b>bags</b> placed on <b>racks</b> and oysters in bags placed directly onto the foreshore, were assessed at a site on the River Dart at Waddeton. The experiment set up the two methods with a replication of the five bags in two blocks. The trial was then repeated fully and partially a third time. The oysters were purchased as seed and grown within the treatments until they had reached commercial market size. Measurements were taken throughout the growing cycle and were used to assess the two growing methods. Additional environmental data was recorded in order to aid comparisons with other similar studies. Following the study it has emerged that there are no advantages in growth rates obtained from either cultivation method. Both methods produce market size Pacific oysters after 20 months, which is comparable with other study growth rates. The major difference comes from the costs associated with the two methods of cultivation; the cost of the shore based system produces an oyster at a saving of 20 % compared to the rack culture. Site selection and substrata condition are the important factors to be considered when deciding which method of cultivation best suits individual operators...|$|R
