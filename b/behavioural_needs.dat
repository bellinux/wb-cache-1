In {{this thesis}} I summarise {{and discuss the}} results of studies regarding motivational aspects on feeding behaviour in dairy cows. Questions addressed concern how feeding duration and rumen fill in cattle influence some behavioural variables reflecting frustrated feeding motivation, such as stereotypies and behaviours related to feed-searching, and also how rumen fill and feeding duration relate to oxytocin and cortisol. We have also investigated if operant conditioning is a useful method to measure and quantify the motivational strength to obtain roughages with different characteristics and sensory qualities.

The aim was {{to test the hypothesis}} that oral manipulation of feed is a <b>behavioural</b> <b>need</b> in cattle, irrespective of rumen load. Low rumen content and long eating time had the effect that the cows spent a rather short time with behaviours related to feed-searching and showed low levels of stereotypies. The cows with long eating time had a larger oxytocin release during the afternoons compared with the cows with short eating time. The cows with high rumen content and short eating time spent relatively more time with behaviours related to feed-searching and with stereotypies. The cortisol concentration in the morning sampling period was higher in the treatment with short eating time compared with the cows with long eating time. The studies with operant conditioning showed large individual differences between cows in their motivation to work for feed in general. The results also showed that cows have individual preference for one specific side. It can be concluded that oral manipulation of feed is a <b>behavioural</b> <b>need</b> in cattle irrespective of rumen load. A short duration of feeding behaviours combined with a low rumen load seriously impairs the welfare of cattle. The results imply that there are physiological mechanisms, possibly in the form of oxytocin, involved in the motivation of feeding. I also conclude that operant conditioning could be a fruitful method to measure and quantify feed preference of dairy cows. However, the results only reflect the preference of the individual animal, and a complete mapping according to side preference must be done of each individual included in the experiment. The practical implication of these studies is to provide all cows with sufficiently long eating time, preferably by constant access to roughage...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} whether the pronounced ecological importance of pebble mounds to pebble-mound mice (Pseudomys) is manifest in their continental biogeography. Location: Northern Australia. Methods: A GIS-based comparison was made between the habitats contained within the potential climatic distributions of mice, representing a null hypothesis of no habitat selection, and their actual distributions based on all known location records. Results: All species had a clear preference for hilly, rocky landscapes with a surficial cover dominated by bedrock. Simple vegetation communities with relatively open eucalypt overstorey and grassy understorey were preferred. Highly degraded rocks and aggradational surfaces and plains were avoided. The extent of the summer monsoon may be important in determining the southern limits of the group's distribution. Major disjunctions between species were attributable {{to the presence of}} clay plains and sand sheets. The behavioural requirement of pebble-mound mice for mounds determines their population distribution pattern and the distribution of the different species within the genus. Main conclusions: The <b>behavioural</b> <b>need</b> for pebble mounds drives the distributional pattern of populations and species of pebble-mound mice. The initial spread of pebble-mound mice probably occurred during the late Pliocene or earliest Pleistocene. There has predominantly been degradation of the potential distribution of the group since that time due to the stability of Australian landscapes and Pleistocene planation and sand sheet development over large areas of northern Australia. This process is ongoing, and past regions of rocky contact between current distributions have disappeared, while the distributional limits of several species are steadily being reduced by erosion of hills and the spread of dune fields...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} to examine the digging behaviour of rabbits in captivity. This survey contained questions for rabbit owners regarding their rabbits´ living environment and digging opportunities. The survey was made available online and after 23 days a total of 337 different individuals had answered. Nine out of ten respondents thought that domesticated rabbits have a <b>behavioural</b> <b>need</b> to dig. However some of them indicated that the need to dig for rabbits is individual, which could be likely. The {{majority of the respondents}} also indicated that they provide their rabbits with digging opportunities on a daily basis. The results nevertheless showed that a small layer of bedding {{on the bottom of the}} cage did not provide a sufficient digging opportunity because it was connected with a higher probability of abnormal digging behaviour. The majority of the respondents gave their rabbits’ shavings, straw or hay as litter whilst they responded that peat or earth would be the best digging material for rabbits. The results from the survey supports the literature stating that rabbits may have a need to perform digging behaviour even if they live in captivity. It is however possible that other behavioral needs such as freedom of movement are more important to avoid stereotypic behaviours. Providing the rabbits with opportunities to dig outside or give them big crates filled with a deep layer of peat, earth or sand, should give them opportunity to perform their natural digging behaviour. This ought to be clarified in the animal welfare legislation in Sweden to increase the knowledge and requirements of how rabbits should be kept in a way that benefits natural behaviour...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} how psychotherapists experience using individual, face-to-face {{cognitive behavioural therapy}} (CBT) aimed at alleviating depressive symptoms in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHOD: Semi-structured interviews with three psychotherapists were conducted after CBT with 12 participants with MS, and analysed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Two main themes emerged: Trusting their expertise as psychotherapists whilst lacking MS-specific knowledge, and The process of exploring the participants' readiness for CBT with modifications of content and delivery. The psychotherapists perceived it difficult to know whether a symptom was attributable to depression or to MS, and for some participants the CBT needed to be adapted to a more concrete content. CONCLUSIONS: Psychotherapists may need more MS-specific knowledge and an insight into the individual's functioning. The content of CBT in terms of concrete home assignments and <b>behavioural</b> activation <b>needs</b> to be individualised...|$|R

30|$|Human {{behaviour}} {{is thus a}} {{clear indicator}} of whether urban spaces are important factors in everyday life or if they are rejected and avoided. While {{the absence of any}} street life can have various reasons, such as security concerns or introverted lifestyles rooted in cultural particularities, the actual activities can be observed and evaluated to gather in-depth insights if public urban spaces are perceived as attractive or repulsive surroundings. Subsequently, urban spaces can be identified as either key centres inviting a wide range of social groups to interact or as segregated spaces with limited access to any form of social inclusion and thus often abused and neglected (Burgess 1925; Altman 1975; Whyte 1980; Gehl 1987; Mitchell 1996).

40|$|Introduction: There {{has been}} a recent {{increase}} in interest in research into the emotional and <b>behavioural</b> <b>needs</b> {{of children and adolescents}} with intellectual disability. The field has tended to focus on the association between emotional and <b>behavioural</b> <b>needs</b> and child characteristics. Little {{attention has been paid to}} the potential importance of social context. Method: Cross-sectional survey of teacher-reported emotional and <b>behavioural</b> <b>needs</b> among 386 South Asian children and 118 Black children in a deprived urban conurbation. Results: The results suggested that: (i) teachers reported higher rates of emotional and <b>behavioural</b> <b>needs</b> among Black (when compared with South Asian) children; (ii) increased rates of emotional and <b>behavioural</b> <b>needs</b> were generally associated with older child age, lower child ability, the absence of sensory impairments and male gender; and (iii) neighbourhood deprivation was associated with variation in emotional and behavioural need differently for the two ethnic groups. For Black children, increased deprivation was associated with increased need. However, for South Asian children increased deprivation was associated with decreased need.

40|$|Osteoporosis is {{a public}} health problem {{implying}} {{an increased risk of}} fractures. Successful fracture prevention contributes to prevention and treatment of osteoporosis as well as reduction of accidents from falling. Determinants such as lifestyle and environmental factors depend on human behaviour. In order to obtain {{a deeper understanding of the}} <b>behavioural</b> changes <b>needed</b> for fracture prevention, the aim of this study was to explore women’s experience of living with osteoporosis and related lifestyle changes. In-depth interviews with 13 women diagnosed with osteoporosis were analysed according to the grounded theory method. The data formed a pattern in which developing healthy risk awareness is the key to motivating risk reduction behaviour as part of a fracture preventing lifestyle. The other five categories are elements in achieving healthy risk awareness: accepting having fragile bones, living with fear, needing to learn, and having confidence as well as experiencing a sense of social context. These findings might be useful to understand better the motivational process underpinning fracture-preventing behaviour among women with osteoporosis...|$|R
40|$|In animals, {{personality}} {{variations in}} response to stress and energy demands have been established. Cognitive processing of negative stimuli correlates with stress response patterns.

The HR-LR strains {{did not differ in}} standard metabolic rate or hypoxia tolerance. HR trout displayed more pronounced avoidance to a signal cue after being conditioned with hypoxia, suggesting that they experienced this stimulus more aversive than LR trout. Together with differences in forebrain c-fos activation patterns in dorsomedial pallium, these results suggest cognitive differences between the strains. These results demonstrate that differences in personality/stress coping style can be related to contrasts in cognition, which are independent of metabolic differences...|$|R
40|$|It is a {{consistent}} finding that, among obese patients, the weight lost {{as a result}} of the most widely available treatments for obesity is almost always regained.

Little research has investigated the psychological mechanisms that might account for this phenomenon. This study aimed to identify psychological factors that predict weight regain. Fifty-four women with obesity who had lost weight by attending community slimming clubs were interviewed immediately after losing 10 % of their initial body weight, and then followed-up every 2 months for a period of 1 year by means of telephone interviews. The results identified two prospective predictors of weight regain: one cognitive factor (dichotomous thinking) and one historical variable (maximum lifetime weight). The finding that a specific cognitive style is a significant predictor of relapse has implications for the treatment of obesity...|$|R
