50|$|The steps {{themselves}} are solid, one piece, die-cast aluminum or steel. Yellow demarcation lines are sometimes added {{to indicate their}} edges. In most escalator models manufactured after 1950, both the riser and the tread of each step is cleated (given a ribbed appearance) with comb-like protrusions that mesh with the comb plates {{on the top and}} <b>bottom</b> <b>platforms</b> and the succeeding steps in the chain. Seeberger escalators featured flat treads and smooth risers; other escalator models have cleated treads and smooth risers. The steps are linked by a continuous metal chain that forms a closed loop. The front and back edges of the steps each have two wheels, the rear of which are set further apart and fit into the trailer-wheel track while the front set have narrower axles and fit the step-wheel track.|$|R

The <b>bottom</b> <b>platform</b> is 14" [...] at its base with another platform beveled right on top of the first. Both platforms are made of silver.

50|$|The {{track system}} {{is built into}} the truss to guide the step chain, which {{continuously}} pulls the steps from the <b>bottom</b> <b>platform</b> and back to the top in an endless loop. One track guides the front wheels of the steps (called the step-wheel track) and another guides the back wheels of the steps (called the trailer-wheel track). The relative positions of these tracks cause the steps to form a staircase as they move out from under the comb plate. Along the straight section of the truss the tracks are at their maximum distance apart. This configuration forces the back of one step to be at a 90-degree angle relative to the step behind it. This right angle forces the steps into a shape resembling a staircase. At {{the top and bottom of}} the escalator, the two tracks converge so that the front and back wheels of the steps are almost in a straight line. This causes the stairs to lay in a flat sheetlike arrangement, one after another, so they can easily travel around the bend in the curved section of track. The tracks carry the steps down along the underside of the truss until they reach the bottom landing, where they pass through another curved section of track before exiting the bottom landing. At this point, the tracks separate and the steps once again assume a staircase configuration. This cycle is repeated continually as the steps are pulled from bottom to top and back to the bottom again.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new method to study and design {{isotropic}} spatial parallel manipulators. We construct the Jacobian matrices of linear and angular velocities symbolically and analyse them. The isotropy of the angular velocity {{and that of the}} linear velocity are treated in a decoupled manner using an algebraic formulation that lead to eigenproblems of certain symmetric matrices. The criteria for isotropy in the individual cases, as well as their combination are expressed in closed-form in terms of the minimum number of algebraic equations. The proposed method is applied to the design of isotropic 6 - 6 Stewart platforms having semi-regular hexagonal top and <b>bottom</b> <b>platforms.</b> Symbolic expressions for two different families of isotropic configurations are obtained. Several mechanically feasible configurations are presented demonstrating orientation, position, and combined kinematic isotropy. Methods are presented for designing a manipulator for combined isotropy with partially specified position and orientation, and for determining the isotropic configurations of a manipulator with a given geometry. The sensitivity of the isotropy conditions with respect to variation in the configuration parameters is studied numerically using the example of an existing manipulator...|$|R

This comprehends the accessibiblity to more cheaper and powerful resources on video-conferencing, data-transfer and multimedia capabiblies which are becoming common place and used as <b>bottom</b> <b>platforms</b> to cooperative solutions. The aim {{of this paper is}} to propose a global solution to support Cooperative Software Development (CSD) through a multimedia environment. These CSD systms have as main goal to enable several users connected over a network to work together in order to develop software. They have to solve problems such as: coherence maintenance of the software project through the distributed system by managing possible conflicts between local versions of each group member and, above all. promote the necessary mechanisms for the inter-group awareness and integrity. We introduce here the strategies of our own CS D prototype: a computer-supported cooperative work architecture for software development. It enables a group of developers (2 to 4), possibly located at remote places and connected over network, to develop software together. A cooperative multimedia editing environment is available for the whole Development Cycle, enclosing mechanisms of computer-conferencing (text, audio, and video communications) ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{a concept}} for a step {{climbing}} wheelchair capable of moving in structured and unstructured environments and climbing over small obstacles like curbs is discussed. The {{design of the}} curb climbing wheelchair consists of a conventional wheelchair with a four-bar linkage mechanism powered by a motorized drive screw attached to the undercarriage of the wheelchair. The four-bar linkage mechanism is directly controlled by the end user through a switch connected to the battery source. As the wheelchair approaches the curb, the <b>bottom</b> <b>platform</b> of the four-bar linkage makes contact with the curb. When contact is made, the end user activates the four-bar linkage mechanism. The four-bar linkage rotates the wheelchair up and forward onto the curb. Tests on a scaled down model and on a one-to-one prototype were conducted in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of this four-bar linkage. Through testing, design changes are recommended and reinforced through solid modeling software...|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{behavior}} of soil under blast loading {{is very important to}} engineers in mining, tunneling, and military construction. Due to the very complex structure of a soil mass {{it is very difficult to}} describe its constitutive relation, especially when it has different water contents and it is under blast loading conditions. New protective system designs subjected to blast loading need to be proved its validation prior to predict effect of explosive before implementation. Full-scale, buried explosive tests are costly. Finite element simulations play a significant role in the design of protective systems, for example a <b>bottom</b> <b>platform</b> of lightweight vehicles, against underground explosion. ^ The Perzyna viscoplastic cap model has been shown to be a valid model for use in the simulations of dry soil behavior under both static and dynamic loading. This model is a dramatic improvement over the inviscid cap model for soil behavior under high strain rate loading, such as from an explosion. However, soil should be modeled as a three-phase porous media to accommodate various degrees of water saturation. This is especially true for the soil mass surrounding the source of energy release, as each of the three phases responds differently to shock loading. To improve the model accuracy, a revised model comprising a Gruneisen equation of state (EOS) for each of the three phases has been developed. These equations of state for solid, water and air have been integrated with a viscoplastic cap model to simulate behaviors of soil with different degrees of water saturation. ^ These EOS models as well as the viscoplastic cap model are implemented into LS-DYNA as user-supplied subroutines for numerical simulation of six explosive tests in dry soil as well as in saturated soil. The shock front time of arrival, the air pressure directly above the buried explosive, and the ejecta heights predicted by the revised cap model agree fairly well with the experimental data. Four elements from finite element mash are selected to observe three phases volume fractions change. There is noticeable improvement in the prediction of saturated soil behavior than dry soil behavior under blast loading. It is concluded that the revised model is adequate for blast loading behavior simulations for soil with different degrees of water saturation. ...|$|E
