40|$|The present review {{provides}} brief {{information about}} the <b>briquetting</b> <b>machine</b> and their one of the part COLLAR. <b>Briquette</b> <b>machine</b> is used to produced briquette. Briquette {{is one of the}} biomass product which is widely used in a boiler for a burning purpose. Briquette is a solid biomass product. Due to solidification of biomass it achieve a better quality of combustion and also it facilitate storage and transportation of biomass. The various method is used to solidify the biomass. These are discuss in various paper. This paper give the brief description of solidification of biomass or <b>briquette</b> by <b>briquetting</b> <b>machine</b> and also discuss about the various part of <b>briquetting</b> <b>machine</b> especially COLLAR. Material has high moisture content needs to be dried either by sun drying or using separate flash drier(optional). The raw materials then mix as per convenient. The mixed raw material has fed to vertical screw conveyer. The conveyer has taken the material to chamber of briquetting press. Then the material is compressed by the press by forcing it through the die with tapered bore. The compression raises the temperature of material, and binds the material together. Briquettes formed are cylinder shape. Which are pushed through cooling tracks under slight pressure for cooling and transport to packing point, where the briquettes are packed and stored for dispatch. The diagram of <b>briquette</b> <b>machine</b> is as follows...|$|R

Other alternatives are often run in commercial purpose because of various problem faced. But to become dependent on a single raw material will cause hamper when there is scarcity of that material in the market. Thus to take the full advantage of the locally available raw materials, different mixture of those are considered for producing briquetting. An experimental investigation has been conducted to evaluate the properties of different raw materials and their products from a <b>briquetting</b> <b>machine.</b> Significant properties of the product from different mixture of raw materials with different compositions have also been determined. A screw press type <b>briquetting</b> <b>machine</b> with heated die has been used for producing briquettes. An economic analysis of the system has also been performed in this study...|$|R

The hardware part consists of hydraulic and electrical components. The key hydraulic components are the pump,the electric cylinders and the valves. The key electrical elements are the inductive sensors, the pressure sensor, the electrovalves and the programmable logic controller (PLC). Hydraulic part of the machine itself did not require major renovation, so the thesis describes it only briefly. The software of the machine is located on the programmable logic controller. Thesis focuses on it. It is implemented in the lader logic diagrams PLC programing language. The programing concept of finite state machines is used.

40|$|Briquetting of the {{carbonized}} agricultural residues {{represents one}} of the possible solutions to the local energy shortages in many developing countries. It constitutes a positive {{solution to the problem of}} increasing rates of desertification in many areas worldwide. Agricultural residues are not attractive as a household fuel source for urban areas because they are very bulky and have low energy intensity. Also, to eliminate the smoke generation when burning agricultural residues requires processing it by carbonization before being used as a house-hold indoor fuel.

40|$|Abstract — In this study, an {{appropriate}} commercial biomass <b>briquetting</b> <b>machine</b> {{suitable for use}} in rural communities was designed and constructed, and the performance evaluation carried out using sawdust. The physical and combustion properties of the briquette were determined at varying biomass-binder ratios of 100 : 15, 100 : 25, 100 : 35 and 100 : 45 using cassava starch as the binding agent. Both the physical and combustion properties of the briquette were significantly affected by the binder level (P < 0. 05). The optimum biomass-binder ratio {{on the basis of}} the compressed density was attained at the 100 : 25 blending ratio having a compressed density of 0. 7269 g/cm 3 and a heating value of 27. 17 MJKg- 1 while the optimum blending ratio {{on the basis of the}} heating value was attained at the 100 : 35 blending ratio with a compressed density of 0. 7028 g/cm 3. It was concluded that the heating values at the optimum biomass-binder ratios were sufficient to produce heat required for household cooking and small scale industrial cottage applications.

40|$|AbstractIn {{rice husk}} {{briquette}} production process, electricity {{is used to}} drive the screw press and to heat up the die barrel. In the energy-starve countries, electricity consumption for producing biomass briquette fuel is not rationale. To reduce the electricity consumption in biomass briquette production process, a biomass fired stove is developed to use as {{the replacement of the}} electric heater. The biomass stove is capable of raising the temperature of die barrel at desired level for making briquette. The stove is made of refractory brick and clay. The stove is fired with rice husk briquette. The stove provides heat to die barrel instead of electric heater. The stove shows satisfactory performance by replacing the 6 kW electric-heater in this study. The modified rice husk <b>briquetting</b> <b>machine</b> consumed about 76 kg of rice husk briquette and about 80 kWh of electricity to produce one tonne of rice husk briquette instead of 179 kWh of electricity consumption by traditional rice husk <b>briquetting</b> <b>machine</b> for same quantity of rice husk briquette produced. Hence at least 50 % of electricity consumption for rice husk briquette production could be replaced by using the modified technology discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of the ongoing ICCI coal {{preparation}} research project is to reduce ash and sulfur content in coal by using fine grinding and other coal cleaning processes. The ultrafine coal particles that result from the grinding and cleaning operations are difficult to dewater, and create problems in their storage, handling and transportation. The objective {{of this research is}} to combine the dewatering and briquetting processes of fine coal preparation into a single stage operation, thereby enhancing the economic viability of utilizing fine coal. A bitumen based emulsion, Orimulsion, has proven to be an effective hydrophobic binder, which helps not only with the briquetting process but also in the expulsion of water from the coal. Encouraging results from the use of a ram extruder briquetting device led to experimentation in the production of briquettes using a lab scale roll briquetting device. In {{the first quarter of this}} reporting year, a commercially available lab scale roll <b>briquetting</b> <b>machine</b> was employed (Komarek B- 100). Further testing was conducted for the rest of the year with the use of a pilot scale model (Komarek B 220 -A). Briquettes were produced and evaluated by comparing results developed by adjusting various parameters of the <b>briquetting</b> <b>machines</b> and feed material. Results further substantiate previous findings that curing time dictates both moisture content and strengths of briquettes, and slower roll speeds produce more robust briquettes. A statistical model was set up to determine the optimal range of operating parameters. The statistical model generated from these results provided basic relationships between the roll speed and briquette form pressure...|$|R

40|$|Assessment {{of energy}} {{consumption}} of pellets and briquettes produc-tion from plant raw materials was presented. Wheat, rye, rape straw and meadow hay {{were used for}} their production. The investigated raw materials were ground before briquetting {{with the use of}} a station drum straw cutter and theoretical length of cutting of 20 mm, whereas before pelleting – {{with the use of a}} beater grinder equipped with sieves of 6 mm meshes diameter. Analysis of moisture of raw materials and their calorific value were carried out according to binding norms. Moisture of compacted raw materials was within 10. 1 - 13. 3 %, where-as the calorific value was from 16. 1 to 17. 9 MJ. kg- 1. Pellets were produced in a pelleting machine with an immobile flat matrix and driven compressing rolls, whereas briquettes were produced in a screw <b>briquetting</b> <b>machine</b> with a heated compressing chamber. The following values of temperature of the compressing chamber of a <b>briquetting</b> <b>machine</b> were assumed: 200, 225 and 250 ºC.
