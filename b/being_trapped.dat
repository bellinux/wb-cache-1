5|$|A hazard {{of flight}} for very small insects such as thrips is the {{possibility}} of <b>being</b> <b>trapped</b> by water. Thrips have non-wetting bodies and have the ability to ascend a meniscus by arching their bodies and working their way head-first and upwards along the water surface in order to escape.|$|E

5|$|As the German commanders on {{the spot}} had warned Hitler in vain, there was little chance of the attack succeeding, and the {{concentration}} of their armoured reserves at {{the western end of}} the front in Normandy soon led to disaster, as they were outflanked to their south and the front to their east collapsed, resulting in many of the German troops in Normandy <b>being</b> <b>trapped</b> in the Falaise Pocket.|$|E

30|$|A similar drop of {{photocurrent}} {{following an}} increase above GaAs bandgap (near 1.4  eV) was observed.

5|$|In {{response}} to the home side's 138, Hassett top-scored with 68 in Australia's first innings of 254 before <b>being</b> <b>trapped</b> leg before wicket by Eric Hollies as the tourists defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets. Hollies's 8/107 was the best innings bowling figures against the Australians for the summer. The feat earned him selection for the Fifth Test, where he dismissed Bradman in his final Test innings for a duck.|$|E
5|$|Olivia (Anna Torv) has {{recovered}} from her ordeal of <b>being</b> <b>trapped</b> in the parallel universe and has rejoined the Fringe team, while {{others on the}} team, particularly Peter (Joshua Jackson), struggle {{with the idea that}} the parallel universe's Olivia, Fauxlivia, had successfully pretended to be Olivia. Throughout the episode, Olivia is shown to be struggling emotionally with knowing that Fauxlivia has lived in her apartment and has slept with Peter.|$|E
5|$|Surface level {{humidity}} is {{less than}} 0.1%. Venus's sulfuric acid rain never reaches the ground, but is evaporated by the heat before reaching the surface in a phenomenon known as virga. It is theorized that early volcanic activity released sulfur into the atmosphere and the high temperatures prevented it from <b>being</b> <b>trapped</b> into solid compounds on the surface as {{it was on the}} Earth.|$|E

50|$|The {{chattering}} lory (Lorius garrulus) is a forest-dwelling parrot {{endemic to}} North Maluku, Indonesia. It is considered vulnerable, the main threat <b>being</b> from <b>trapping</b> for the cage-bird trade.|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the Pyramid Texts which focus on the celestial realm, the coffin texts emphasize the subterranean elements of the afterlife ruled by the deity Osiris, {{in a place called}} the Duat. An Osirian afterlife is offered to everyone, and the deceased is even referred to as [...] "the Osiris-name". This subterranean realm is described as being filled with threatening <b>beings,</b> <b>traps,</b> and snares with which the deceased must contend. The spells in the Coffin Texts allow the deceased to protect themselves against these dangers and [...] "dying a second death".|$|R
5|$|The {{southbound}} {{platform is}} {{adjacent to the}} station building, and its high-level section requires crossing only a lightly used spur of State Street. However, access to the northbound platform requires crossing both Northeast Corridor tracks. The footbridge to the planned Coast Guard Museum will allow access to the northbound platform without crossing tracks, which will improve safety and prevent passengers from <b>being</b> <b>trapped</b> on the platform by stopped trains.|$|E

Noticing signs of impending doom Clear saves Alex from a speeding bus but they both witness Carter's demise by a falling sign.|$|E
5|$|Neon is {{abundant}} on a universal scale; {{it is the}} fifth most abundant chemical element in the universe by mass, after hydrogen, helium, oxygen, and carbon (see chemical element). Its relative rarity on Earth, like that of helium, is due to its relative lightness, high vapor pressure at very low temperatures, and chemical inertness, all properties which tend {{to keep it from}} <b>being</b> <b>trapped</b> in the condensing gas and dust clouds that formed the smaller and warmer solid planets like Earth.|$|E

25|$|One cannot {{overestimate}} {{the importance of}} human rights discourse in shaping public opinion. What are the rights and obligations of human <b>beings</b> <b>trapped</b> in conflicts? Or, incarcerated as part of ethnic cleansing? Equally striking, are the pre-industrialized tribes newly discovered by scientists living {{in the depths of}} dense jungle? These rights can be equated with the rise of global citizenship as normative associations, indicating a national citizenship model that is more closed and a global citizenship one that is more flexible and inclusive. If true, this places a strain in the relationship between national and global citizenship.|$|R
5|$|After a one-minute {{break between}} periods, the third {{overtime}} began with another jump ball that was won by Chamberlain. After King missed the opening {{shot of the}} period, Carolina's Kearns made a right handed layup to bring the score to 50–48. Kansas failed to score again, and this time Kearns missed his shot after being fouled, but then made both free throws. Off of a pass from Loneski, Chamberlain made a shot, was fouled, and made the ensuing free throw to complete the three-point play and bring the Jayhawks within one point. Cunningham was fouled after <b>being</b> <b>trapped</b> in a double team and then missed the first shot of the one-and-one. The Jayhawks' Loneski missed a contested, close layup, but King got the offensive rebound and was fouled on a put back shot. King made one of the free throws and tied the score at 5252.|$|E
5|$|After <b>being</b> <b>trapped</b> in the harbour {{for more}} than a year, Great Britain was at last floated out in December 1844, but not before causing more anxiety for her proprietors. After passing {{successfully}} through the first set of lock gates, she jammed on her passage through the second, which led to the River Avon. Only the seamanship of Captain Claxton (who after Naval service held the position of Quay Warden (Harbour Master) at Bristol) enabled her to be pulled back and severe structural damage avoided. The following day an army of workmen, under the direct control of Brunel, took advantage of the slightly higher tide and removed coping stones and lock gate platforms from the Junction Lock, allowing the tug Samson, again under Claxton's supervision, to tow the ship safely into the Avon that midnight.|$|E
5|$|After the engagement, the Allies {{received}} news of {{the defeat}} of the Allied army at Thermopylae. Since their strategy required both Thermopylae and Artemisium to be held, and given their losses, the Allies decided to withdraw to Salamis. The Persians overran Boeotia and captured the now-evacuated Athens. However, seeking a decisive victory over the Allied fleet, the Persians were later defeated at the Battle of Salamis in late 480 BC. Fearing <b>being</b> <b>trapped</b> in Europe, Xerxes withdrew with much of his army to Asia, leaving Mardonius to complete the conquest of Greece. The following year, however, saw an Allied army decisively defeat the Persians at the Battle of Plataea, thereby ending the Persian invasion.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{struggled}} {{against the new}} ball in the first {{hour of the day}} three. Miller played and missed three times in one over before <b>being</b> <b>trapped</b> lbw for 31; the tourists added only nine runs in the first hour. Four runs later, Morris reached 51 and fell to Bedser, leaving Australia at 5/139. It had been a slow morning for Morris—he took 21 minutes to add a single to his overnight total and reached 50 after taking another 24 minutes to register his second run of the day. Australia fell for 221, narrowly avoiding the follow on, and England declared at 3/174 on the last morning after many rain delays. This left Bradman’s team with a victory target of 317, but the rain kept falling and the entire morning was lost.|$|E
5|$|Computer {{simulations}} of the dusty disk orbiting Epsilon Eridani {{suggest that the}} shape of the disk may be explained by the presence of a second planet, tentatively dubbed Epsilon Eridanic. Clumping in the dust disk may occur because dust particles are <b>being</b> <b>trapped</b> in orbits that have resonant orbital periods with a planet in an eccentric orbit. The postulated Epsilon Eridanic would orbit at a distance of 40AU, with an eccentricity of 0.3 and a period of 280 years. The inner cavity of the disk may be explained by the presence of additional planets. Current models of planet formation cannot easily explain how a planet could have been created at this distance from Epsilon Eridani. The disk is expected to have dissipated long before a giant planet could have formed. Instead, the planet may have formed at an orbital distance of about 10AU, then migrated outward because of gravitational interaction with the disc or with other planets in the system.|$|E
5|$|Ebsary {{made her}} Test debut against England in a one-off match at County Road in Worcestershire. Australia batted first and Ebsary {{came to the}} crease at No. 9 with the total on 7/271. She scored 3 from 15 balls before <b>being</b> <b>trapped</b> leg before wicket by Katherine Brunt, as Australia were {{dismissed}} for 309. She then took 2/35. She claimed her maiden Test wicket by having Taylor caught by Poulton for 10 and then had Jenny Gunn caught behind by Jodie Fields for 41. This ended a 77-run partnership with Beth Morgan and left the hosts at 6/136 but they recovered to reach 268, still enough for Australia to take a 41-run lead. Ebsary was then promoted to No. 4 and made 21 as Australia set the hosts a target of 273 before the match was drawn.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the South station's demolition in 1996, thousands of pounds were spent on a number of security measures; the site was fenced off, bunding was installed, warning signs were put up and security patrols took place. However, large sections of the fencing were stolen and the warning signs were ignored. Ultimately this led to one man <b>being</b> <b>trapped</b> on the site for five hours on 22May 1997. He had been looking for scrap metal and power cables, and had climbed through a small hole into an underground room, from which he had to be rescued by fire crews. The site was then designated a danger zone. The derelict site was vandalised in July 1999, when people hurled burning tyres into the sub-station, creating a fire and damaging cables worth £150,000.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match against Leicestershire, Loxton was given his first chance on English soil. Batting at No. 7, he managed only four before <b>being</b> <b>trapped</b> leg before wicket by Australian {{expatriate}} left arm orthodox spinner Vic Jackson, as Australia amassed 448. He {{then opened the}} bowling and castled home captain Les Berry for one to leave the hosts at 1/1 and take his first wicket on English soil. He also took two catches, both from the bowling of fellow Victorian Doug Ring as the hosts fell for 130. Loxton again opened the bowling in the second innings as Australia enforced the follow on and dismissed the hosts for 147 to seal another innings win. Loxton took 1/11 and 0/12 from six and seven overs respectively.|$|E
5|$|Later on that day, a deserter {{from the}} Persian fleet, a Greek called Scyllias, swam into the Allied camp. He brought {{bad news for}} the Allies — whilst most of the Persian fleet was {{undergoing}} repairs, the Persians had detached 200 seaworthy ships to sail around the outer coast of Euboea, to block the escape route of the Allied fleet. The Persians did not want to attack the Allies yet, because they thought the Allies would simply flee, and so they sought to trap them. The Allies resolved to go and meet this detachment, to prevent <b>being</b> <b>trapped,</b> though they planned to leave by nightfall to prevent the Persians becoming aware of their plans.|$|E
5000|$|Remembrance {{garnered}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music journalists. Some reviewers, including Tiny Mix Tapes critic Gage Taylor and Mark Richardson of Pitchfork Media praised the album {{for making a}} different type of trap music from what was common by acts associted with the internet music scene, the rare type <b>being</b> <b>trap</b> music that creates its own emotion and is optimistic. Taylor and Richardson especially praised the last track, which was a cover of [...] "When You Sleep" [...] by My Bloody Valentine; Richardson wrote, [...] "MBV covers can go wrong so easily, but Prudhomme finds something new in the song, an iciness and feeling of isolation that move in opposition to the warmth found on the most oceanic of albums".|$|R
