50|$|Early Childhood Caries (ECC), {{formerly}} known as nursing bottle caries, baby bottle tooth decay, night <b>bottle</b> <b>mouth</b> and night bottle caries, is a disease that affects teeth in children aged between birth and 71 months. ECC {{is characterized by the}} presence of 1 or more decayed (noncavitated or cavitated lesions), missing (due to caries), or filled tooth surfaces in any primary tooth. ECC {{has been shown to be}} a very common, transmissible bacterial infection, usually passed from the primary caregiver to the child. The main bacteria responsible for dental caries is Streptococcus mutans (S. Mutans) and Lactobacillus. There is also evidence that supports that those who are in lower socioeconomic populations are at greater risk of developing ECC.|$|E
40|$|Image {{segmentation}} for <b>bottle</b> <b>mouth</b> is {{an important}} part of <b>bottle</b> <b>mouth</b> inspection system. In this paper, a sliding window based classification method was proposed for image segmentation in complex industrial environment. Firstly, the image segmentation problem is viewed as a classification task, and Backpropagation Neural Network (BP) is applied to classify each pixel from the target area according to the information extracted from the image. Different from the traditional image segmentation methods, an appropriate size of sliding window is used to extract pixel information. When the window slides, the image in the window is converted to a characteristics matrix which is used as the input of the BP neural network. Experimental results on real-world dataset showed that compared with traditional methods, the new method was more accurate and effective, especially in the conditions of complex background and external disturbance...|$|E

5000|$|Throughout its history, the fiasco {{was found}} on the tables of peasants and Popes alike. A decree from 1574 fixed the {{capacity}} of the mezzo quarto bottle, and established a public office that would certify the capacity of fiaschi by a lead seal applied to the straw covering. However, producers soon started re-using the baskets from discarded certified fiaschi to dress new sub-standard bottles. To avoid this common fraud, another decree from 1618 specified that the seal was to be applied to the glass bottle itself. In 1621, yet another decree mandated sealing the <b>bottle's</b> <b>mouth</b> with molten lead. For this reason, the straw cover had to be reduced, leaving the bottle bare from the [...] "shoulder" [...] up—an arrangement that persists to this day.|$|R

50|$|Similar to a gravity bong, a {{waterfall}} bong utilizes both {{a bottle and}} a cap or screen rigged over the <b>bottle's</b> <b>mouth</b> to hold cannabis. In this case, however, the bottle—which has one or several holes drilled near or at the bottom—is either filled with water or placed in a larger container filled with water before the cannabis is packed. The holes are then uncovered, or the bottle is simply raised from the container, evacuating the water either onto the ground or back into the container. When heat {{is applied to the}} drug, the resultant smoke is forced into the bottle with negative gauge pressure, as with the gravity bong. Once the water is evacuated, the smoke can be inhaled from the bottle. Variations on this concept are also used.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{different}} bottle opening sizes (28, 33, and 38 mm in diameter) and beverage types (e. g. green tea, carbonated beverages) on the drinking satisfaction of consumers, {{in order to enhance}} their comfort levels when drinking from aluminum beverage bottles. A survey of 120 Japanese subjects was conducted, and the 33 mm opening size emerged as the most preferred, irrespective of beverage type. The factor analysis results of the questionnaire show that drinking satisfaction is primarily affected by two common factors: the volume of flow from the <b>bottle</b> to the <b>mouth</b> and the adjustability of the flow. The results of the three-dimensional fluid-dynamics analysis indicate that differences in beverage type could influence what consumers regard as an appropriate flow. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The shoulders were ever so much too wide, the waist was ever so much too big, and the long sleeves were turned back and rolled up.

50|$|In 2015 SIGG the Swiss company {{enlarged}} its {{portfolio of}} productmaterials with presented a new bottle made of glass. The bottle consists of twowalls of heat-resistant borosilicate glass, a WMB (wide <b>mouth</b> <b>bottle)</b> openingto {{allow for the}} addition of ice cubes, and two removable silicone elements: agrip around {{the body of the}} bottle and a base stand with shock-absorbingstrips. These elements protect the fingers and prevent the bottle from breakingby being knocked or set down too heavily. The two separate glass walls provideoptimal insulation, so cold drinks stay cool (for up to two hours) and hotdrinks stay pleasantly warm (for up to one hour). The bottle can be comfortablyhandled even when it contains hot drinks and the outer wall does not build upcondensation when it contains cold ones. The liquid only comes into contactwith glass and stainless steel so its flavor remains unaffected. All thematerials used for the bottle are BPA and BPS free.|$|R
