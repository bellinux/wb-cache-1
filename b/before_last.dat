5|$|The 1827 North Carolina {{hurricane}} caused severe impacts {{along its}} track through the northeastern Caribbean Sea {{and up the}} East Coast of the United States in late August1827. First observed over the Leeward Islands on August17, the storm continued northwest, passing over Puerto Rico and the northern coastline of Hispaniola. It moved through the Turks and Caicos Islands and then the Bahamas by August21 and curved northward. Although there is some discrepancy in its track, the hurricane moved ashore somewhere along the North Carolina coastline on August25, perhaps at Category4 intensity on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The cyclone emerged back into the Atlantic Ocean around Norfolk, Virginia, and grazed the New England coastline <b>before</b> <b>last</b> being observed offshore Nova Scotia on August28. Along its track, numerous vessels were damaged, capsized, or run aground. The combination of heavy rainfall and ferocious winds caused severe crop damage, damaged or destroyed structures, and snapped and uprooted trees. Overall, the storm was responsible {{for more than six}} deaths and at least two injuries.|$|E

5|$|These {{delays in}} turn {{affected}} the fly-in of 1 RAR, with the companies forced to wait at the departure point in AO Colombus before they commenced the air move to FSB Coral. Hughes visited Bennett at FSB Coral at 15:30 to discuss {{aspects of the}} defence, as well as events planned for the following day. The deployment of the second battalion was not complete until 16:10, with the 1 RAR Mortar Platoon arriving on the last flight, {{more than four hours}} late. It became clear to Bennett that 1 RAR would need to deploy to the east of the FSB, and with just two hours <b>before</b> <b>last</b> light the companies were moved into hasty defensive positions, the last of which were not established until 17:00. Due to the hurried deployment, by dusk the two battalions of 1 ATF and their supporting elements were scattered around FSB Coral in four roughly connected groups, rather than in a co-ordinated defensive position. The task force headquarters advance party and part of its Defence Platoon were located centrally, yet the task force tactical headquarters and the artillery tactical headquarters under Lieutenant Colonel Jack Kelly—Commanding Officer of 12th Field Regiment—both remained in Bearcat. Hughes was not present either, having left Bearcat to attend to matters at the task force rear headquarters at Nui Dat, and was due to move forward with the tactical headquarters to FSB Coral the following day.|$|E

500|$|Typhoon Agnes, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Pining, {{produced}} among the heaviest rains recorded during the 20th century in South Korea, with [...] falling over a two-day span. The storm originated as a tropical depression near Guam on August25, 1981. Moving along a west-northwest to northwest track, the system gradually strengthened as deep convection organized around it. The depression was assigned the name Agnes on August27 following the development of gale-force winds. Further intensification to typhoon-status occurred by August29. Agnes attained its peak intensity on August31 over the East China Sea as a Category2-equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale with winds of 175km/h (110mph). Subsequent interaction with a mid-latitude trough induced an extratropical transition as the cyclone slowed and turned north. The system had lost most of its tropical characteristics by September1, {{with the majority of}} convection sheared northeast over South Korea and Japan. Agnes later accelerated northeast and completed its transition on September3. The remnants continued along this course, impacting northern Japan and the Kamchatka Peninsula <b>before</b> <b>last</b> being noted on September6 near the International Dateline.|$|E

The writer Jules Amédée Barbey d'Aurevilly described her this way: [...] "Her beauty was imposing and noble, somewhat massive, a little fleshy, but even in stoutness she retained a very lively charm which was spiced with a delightful foreign accent and a striking hint of sensuality." [...] As she began sorting through Balzac's papers, she called on his friend, Champfleury, for assistance. As they worked one evening, he complained of a headache. [...] "I'll make it go away," [...] she said, and began massaging his forehead. As he wrote later: [...] "There are certain magnetic effluvia, in such situations, of which the effect is that the matter does not stop there." [...] Her affair with the man twenty years her junior was brief, but it provided a tremendous release to Hańska, who had spent decades with older men {{in various states of}} ill health. She began partaking of the social life around her. [...] "The night <b>before</b> <b>last</b> I laughed as I have never done before," [...] she wrote in 1851.

He has played four years on the Harvard team, becoming center rusher in his freshman year. He played a right guard in the two following years, but returned to his old place, because there was no one else to fill the old place.

[...] At the end of the 1890 season, Cranston was again selected for [...] on the College Football All-America Team, this time as the center. In 1891, The New York Times reported that Cranston had left Harvard:"Cranston is another man who will be missed.
