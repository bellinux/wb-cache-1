On 30 April 2013 the new Bill—The West Bengal Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishments Bill (2013), was passed in a two-day special session of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly. The new law has provisions for retrospective effect, search and seizure, enhanced penalties, establishment of special courts and confiscation of property. As the Bill pertained to the Concurrent List of the Indian Constitution, on which a federal law was already in place, it required approval from the President. The <b>Bill</b> was <b>sent</b> to the Union Home Ministry, which sent it back to the West Bengal Assembly on 6 June 2013, stating that the Bill has penal provisions implemented with retrospective effect, thus contravening the Basic structure doctrine of the Indian constitution and the established criminal law jurisprudence.

Bills designated as [...] "very urgent" [...] are immediately sent to the competent Standing Committee which must first decide whether to accept or reject the government's request. If it accepts the request, it examines the bill in one sitting and must submit its report within the time constraints set by the Speaker (usually within 6-8 hours). After the committee stage, the <b>bill</b> is immediately <b>sent</b> <b>for</b> discussion in the Plenum (usually the next day) where discussion takes place in one sitting which cannot last longer than ten hours.

40|$|Global Knowledge GK 302 Mai 2013 The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore {{challenges}} facing newly qualified nurses in the first year of practice, a cultural perspective on Norway and Zambia. This was a qualitative type of study with a purposeful convenience sampling of newly qualified nurses in their first year of practice. However, the inclusion criteria extended to nurses who had more years in service and their responses proved to be relevant to the study. Data were gathered using a semi-structured interview guide, which was electronically <b>sent</b> <b>for</b> data <b>collection</b> and analyzed with a colour coding process through which four categories of intra-personal, inter-personal, organizational and structural levels emerged. The intra-personal level mainly presented similarities for the two countries, showing that the newly qualified nurses had the will and drive to work as nurses in the first year of practice, while the inter-personal level showed differences in caring for patients and/or their relatives between Norway and Zambia and this was linked to differences in the type of culture. The organizational level showed differences between the two set-ups associated with hierarchy and finally the structural level brought out more challenges from the Zambian respondents because of the country's Lower Middle Income status. Ethical considerations were ensured by means of privacy, anonymity and confidentiality. The authors recommend that more research should be done on how potential gender differences may have an impact on the challenges facing newly qualified nurses in their first year of practice...|$|R
