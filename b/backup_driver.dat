50|$|During {{the third}} practice, on Saturday, A1 Team Pakistan driver Adam Khan was {{involved}} in a serious crash, forcing a helicopter flight to the nearest hospital for precautionary CT scans. These scans showed negative, but Khan was unable to compete in the remainder of the weekend's events, replaced by A1 Team Italy's <b>backup</b> <b>driver,</b> Enrico Toccacelo but Pakistan would not score points.|$|E
50|$|PacWest driver Maur√≠cio Gugelmin, {{after being}} {{involved}} in a major crash in Texas the week before, withdrew from the event at Nazareth {{following the death of}} his six-year-old son, who had cerebral palsy. Gugelmin had not missed a race since his CART debut at Mid-Ohio in 1993; his 130 consecutive race-streak had been the longest of all active drivers in the series. Because the news came on such short notice, PacWest Racing had no <b>backup</b> <b>drivers</b> available to fill in for Gugelmin, and so the NEXTEL sponsorship from his car was placed onto his teammate's, Scott Dixon, instead.|$|R
50|$|On February 8, 1969, {{the first}} I-500 was held with forty-seven {{qualifying}} drivers. At the time, {{there was no}} standard of rules for snowmobile races of this type, so the I-500 Committee adapted {{the rules of the}} Indy 500. Volunteers counted the laps, as they would do for the next twenty-eight years. Each rider was required to have at least three <b>backup</b> <b>drivers,</b> and they had to change places every fifty laps or less. The total prize money allotted for all places was $10,000. After thirteen hours and forty-two minutes of racing, Dan Planck won the first I-500 on a Ski-Doo. By the time Planck crossed the finish line, only twenty-six snowmobiles were still running. By the following year, news of the race had spread, and professional drivers began attending the I-500. It has since {{become one of the most}} important snowmobile racing events for manufacturers to showcase their machine's performance and durability.|$|R
50|$|The CTC {{did have}} one {{cellular}} phone as a <b>backup,</b> but the <b>driver</b> of the Metro Express train {{was not given}} the number. Also, the CTC office did not have contact details for the Metro Express driver.|$|R
50|$|During {{the weekend}} before the race, Moore was knocked off his motor scooter by a paddock vehicle and injured his right hand. Unsure {{that he would be}} able to race, Player's-Forsythe hired Roberto Moreno as an {{emergency}} <b>backup</b> <b>driver.</b> After a medical consultation, and an in-car test, he was allowed to race using a hand brace, starting from the back of the grid because his team had missed qualifying.|$|E
50|$|On {{the night}} of the race, the Trueno does not show up, and the Speedstars enlist a <b>backup</b> <b>driver</b> for the first run. At the last moment before the race starts, the Trueno arrives. Takumi steps out of the car to the bewilderment of the Speedstars, who were expecting Bunta. He easily defeats the Red Suns driver by {{utilizing}} a dangerous technique on the mountain road's hairpin corners.|$|E
5000|$|... 2007: Kurt Busch {{dominated}} the 2007 race, leading a race record 175 laps. It {{was the final}} Pocono race before the debut of NASCAR's Car of Tomorrow. In this race it is remembered {{for the fact that}} Robby Gordon was disqualified by NASCAR for his actions the previous day at the NBS race at Montreal. Robby Gordon Motorsports' <b>backup</b> <b>driver,</b> P. J. Jones took his place in the No. 7 chevy.|$|E
25|$|After World War II {{the area}} began {{to become more}} developed. In 1956 New Jersey's first {{shopping}} center, Somerset Shopping Center, opened next to the circle. As the area became more developed and traffic and road speeds increased, the circle became notorious for being confusing for people unfamiliar with it, and for frequent car accidents and traffic <b>backups.</b> Many <b>drivers</b> would attempt to bypass the circle by using nearby local roads. In 1991 there were 195 reported traffic accidents on the circle.|$|R
50|$|Kanzaki Jiro (Takuya Kimura) (who {{used to be}} a star driver back in Japan) is a <b>backup</b> F3000 <b>driver</b> in Europe. During a {{practice}} run, he accidentally crashes into his first driver and loses his job. No other club in Europe would hire him as he is deemed too old for the sports. He {{has no choice but to}} return to Japan to his previous racing team. Unfortunately, the team now has a better and younger driver, and feels Jiro has nothing more to contribute to the team, and do not want him back.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe City Automated Transport System (CATS) was a {{collaborative}} FP 7 European project that lasted from 2010 to 2014. Its {{objective was to}} evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of driverless electric vehicles in European cities. This contribution explains how the project was implemented by 11 teams in five countries, culminating with practical trials of driverless vehicles in Strasbourg, France; Ploiesti, Romania; and Lausanne, Switzerland. The Navya vehicles used were able to transport up to eight passengers, in an open vehicle where passengers could recline against lumbar support cushions. After extensive road testing in Strasbourg, the final demonstration {{took place at the}} EPFL campus in Lausanne, where around 1600 people were transported safely during 16 days of vehicle operation. Three vehicles were used, a fourth remaining on campus as a <b>backup.</b> Although no <b>driver</b> was present, a student was available on board of each vehicle to respond to questions from the passengers and to handle the three points on the 1. 8 km route where there was insufficient leeway for two vehicles to pass each other. Passenger reactions to the driverless vehicle concept were collected by questionnaire and were overwhelmingly positive. Caveats include limited access for people with disabilities and the risk that a regular service based on this new concept might compete with walking and cycling rather than with transport by car. Implications for the acceptability of driverless electric vehicles in Europe and elsewhere are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Having no {{mechanical}} experience, Jackson {{convinced a}} young mechanic and chauffeur, Sewall K. Crocker, {{to serve as}} his travel companion, mechanic, and <b>backup</b> <b>driver.</b> Crocker suggested that Jackson buy a Winton car. He bought a slightly used, two-cylinder, 20 hp Winton, which he named the Vermont, after his home state, bade his wife goodbye, and left San Francisco on May 23, carrying coats, rubber protective suits, sleeping bags, blankets, canteens, a water bag, an axe, a shovel, a telescope, tools, spare parts, a block and tackle, cans for extra gasoline and oil, a Kodak camera, a rifle, a shotgun, and pistols.|$|E
50|$|Scott Pruett won {{the pole}} for the race, his {{only of the}} season and also for the team. His fastest lap had an average speed of 235.398 miles per hour. The {{championship}} contenders Montoya qualified 3rd and Franchitti in 8th. Greg Moore was the only driver that did not make a qualifying run, thus starting {{at the rear of the}} field. Moore was not even certain to be in the race due to an accident in the paddock area the weekend before the race, where he was hit by a vehicle while riding his motor scooter. Moore suffered a broken hand in the incident and his team, Forsythe Racing, hired Roberto Moreno as an emergency <b>backup</b> <b>driver</b> if Moore could not run the entire race. After a medical consultation, and an in-car test, he was allowed to race using a hand brace and had the pain dulled with an injection of medicine.|$|E
5000|$|The DieHard 500 {{was held}} July 26 at Talladega Superspeedway in Talladega, Alabama. Sterling Marlin won the pole. In awe-inspiring fashion, Allison {{walked into the}} garage area at Talladega, {{determined}} {{to put on his}} uniform and drive in the DieHard 500. With a tailor-made cast, a wrist brace and velcro on the shifter, Allison started the race and gained the all-important Winston Cup points. After four laps, <b>backup</b> <b>driver</b> Bobby Hillin Jr. took over the wheel and nearly drove the Texaco Ford to victory. Irvan and Marlin again battled for superspeedway supremacy with Irvan nipping the winless Marlin by a scant [...]19 seconds. Earnhardt had engine failure again and finished dead last {{for the second time in}} three races, taking him out of contention for a third consecutive Winston Cup title. Remarkably, Hillin's third-place run in Allison's sted gave the Texaco/Havoline team a one-point lead over Elliott in the points chase. Kulwicki trailed by 120 points and Gant by 129.|$|E
50|$|John Henry and Spencer Rhodes had {{an early}} morning show that {{featured}} county/ western and swing {{in the early morning}} hours and early rock and roll later in the day. They featured many artists from the 1930s and the 1940s with a lot of focus on Hank Williams and Bob Wills who did a radio show from the Cain's Ballroom originating from Tulsa, Oklahoma. This show was on everyday for many years and John Henry and Spencer Rhodes did a daily show on the old country music featuring their own personal record collections. They also concentrated on the early years of Rock and Roll and had many of the original artists in studio who gave interviews and spoke of their own upbringings. These artists included the Shirelles, Chubby Checker, Chuck Berry, Hank Williams <b>backup</b> musicians and <b>driver</b> of their tour bus, Roy Orbison, Bo Diddley who in an interview with Spencer Rhodes spoke of days of picking cotton as a child. There were many other artists from the 1940s and 1950s that played the state fair circuits later in life that came to Tulsa, Oklahoma that stopped by the studio and gave interviews to John Henry and Spencer Rhodes early morning Country Swing and Rock and Roll show known as the Hillbilly Hit Parade. Spencer Rhodes children recorded almost all of the shows and still have them on recordings. Spencer Rhodes maintained relationships with many of the artists he admired as a teenager and many of the records played on the Rock and Roll part of show were the records he bought as a teenager and to his appreciation he had many of the artists from that era autograph the records he bought in the 1950s.|$|R

5000|$|In 2007 Gordon {{only had}} a few top tens in the NBS and came near to a win at Montreal before being disqualified by NASCAR for {{ignoring}} a penalty. He was further in trouble when he reacted to the penalty by intentionally crashing Marcos Ambrose to retaliate for a previous crash - an action that denied Ambrose (who dominated the race) the win and got Gordon suspended from the Sprint Cup Race at Pocono the next day. A <b>backup</b> <b>driver</b> and one of Gordon's friends, P. J. Jones took over for Gordon upon his suspension. Gordon, {{to make up for}} the incident, gave Ambrose a free race for RGM at Watkins Glen International the next weekend to make his first Sprint Cup start but because of rain, Ambrose did not qualify. Gordon, his sponsors and fans have said to this day that he won the 2007 NAPA 200 but nonetheless have accepted the penalty. In 2010, Gordon announced that he made himself a banner and makeshift trophy similar to the NAPA 200 trophy saying he won the 2007 NAPA 200 and when asked by reporters about how he was going to recover in 2010's Montreal race Gordon chuckled and said [...] "You mean since I won? We‚Äôve still got the banner hanging on our wall. We came back for redemption, and we‚Äôll do the best job we can.‚Äù ...|$|E
40|$|The {{interest}} in autonomous vehicles {{has never been}} higher {{and there are several}} components that need to function for a vehicle to be fully autonomous; one of which is the ability to perform a parking {{at the end of a}} mission. The objective of this thesis work is to develop and implement an automatic parking system (APS) for a heavy-duty vehicle (HDV). A delimitation in this thesis work is that the parking lot has a known structure and the HDV is a truck without any trailer and access to more computational power and sensors than today's commercial trucks. An automatic system for searching the parking lot has been developed which updates an occupancy grid map (OGM) based on measurements from GPS and LIDAR sensors mounted on the truck. Based on the OGM and the known structure of the parking lot, the state of the parking spots is determined and a path can be computed between the current and desired position. Based on a kinematic model of the HDV, a gain-scheduled linear quadratic (LQ) controller with feedforward action is developed. The controller's objective is to stabilize the lateral error dynamics of the system around a precomputed path. The LQ controller explicitly takes into account that there exist an input delay in the system. Due to minor complications with the precomputed path the LQ controller causes the steering wheel turn too rapidly which makes the <b>backup</b> <b>driver</b> nervous. To limit these rapid changes of the steering wheel a controller based on model predictive control (MPC) is developed with the goal of making the steering wheel behave more human-like. A constraint for maximum allowed changes of the controller output is added to the MPC formulation as well as physical restrictions and the resulting MPC controller is smoother and more human-like, but due to computational limitations the controller turns out less effective than desired. Development and testing of the two controllers are evaluated in three different environments of varying complexity; the simplest simulation environment contains a basic vehicle model and serves as a proof of concept environment, the second simulation environment uses a more realistic vehicle model and finally the controllers are evaluated on a full-scale HDV. Finally, system tests of the APS are performed and the HDV successfully parks with the LQ controller as well as the MPC controller. The concept of a self-parking HDV has been demonstrated even though more tuning and development needs to be done before the proposed APS can be used in a commercial HDV...|$|E
