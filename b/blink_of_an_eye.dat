50|$|The work unfolds in two phases: the first, lays bare the presuppositions of {{the concept}} of Velayat, which {{concerns}} the meaning of the term, its interpretation in mysticism (Irfan), philosophy (Kalam), jurisprudence (Figh'h), The Qur'an, and Tradition (Sonnat). In every instance, Kadivar discounts political implications of the term. He traces the first indication of the thesis to the writings of eighteenth and nineteenth century jurists namely, Mohaghegh e Karaki, Shahid Thani, and Ahmad Naraghi. Kadivar, thus determines the age {{of the concept}} as less than two centuries, <b>a</b> mere <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> compared to the history of Shiite jurisprudence.|$|R
25|$|The {{coherence}} and low divergence angle of laser light, aided by focusing from {{the lens of}} an eye, can cause laser radiation to be concentrated into an extremely small spot on the retina. A transient increase of only 10 °C can destroy retinal photoreceptor cells.

40|$|Strength {{training}} {{is important for}} everyone, including children with cerebral palsy. The concept of strength development for cerebral palsy (CP) has recently become very popular. The idea of intensive therapy to treat patients with CP is supported by research. However, many professionals suffer from <b>a</b> lack <b>of</b> basic knowledge about strengthening physiology, strength training, adaptation to exercises, etc. Therapists and fitness and wellness instructors are often {{not sure how to}} proceed, and they end up modifying adult versions of strength training programs and applying them to children. Many professionals misinterpret pediatric strength training as a weight lifting, power lifting, and body building therapy program. To understand the role of strength in intensive therapy, one needs to understand that strength is the most important element of life. All human movement—from the <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> to walking and running—depends on strength and proper functioning of skeletal muscle. Each basic activity is based on strength. It is impossible to develop endurance, speed, agility, balance or coordination without it. Research confirms that children with CP respond to external stimuli such as strengthening exercises the same way (neurologically and morphologically) as non-disabled individuals. These findings allow therapists to use knowledge from sport medicine and exercise physiology to develop a new and effective therapy program. Strength is very important for patients with neuromotor disorders. It helps not only to initiate movement, but also to control or inhibit it. Some benefits of strength include: Increases postural muscle tone;• Decreases spasticity;• Helps prevent contractures/deformities;...|$|R

40|$|As flies {{navigate}} {{their environment}} {{in search of}} food or mates, they execute sharp turns known as saccades that occur faster than the <b>blink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> human <b>eye.</b> These maneuvers are initiated by changes in visual motion detected by the eyes, whereas their termination is under the control of small, dumbbell-shaped structures called halteres. The halteres are located behind the forewings and evolved from the hindwings. These structures oscillate during flight and function as biological gyroscopes; they detect unexpected body rotations during flight and trigger wing reflex maneuvers. Like the wings, the halteres possess <b>a</b> small set <b>of</b> muscles that control the structure’s motion from their base and receive input from the visual system. However, while the critical role of the halteres in stabilizing flight is long known as flies crash catastrophically without them, the role of the haltere and its steering muscles during flight maneuvers remains unclear. Using fluorescence imaging of the genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP 6 f, we observed haltere steering muscle activity in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, during <b>a</b> broad array <b>of</b> visual stimuli. We found that these muscles are particularly responsive during voluntary escape maneuvers and are tuned to rotations about the body’s cardinal axes. These results suggest that the visual system is able to activate individual muscles to control haltere motion, and thus mechanosensory input. With this work, we are beginning to understand how hard-wired reflexes may be modified by the nervous system to produce voluntary behaviors...|$|R

5|$|Following his {{freshman}} college season, McKee {{qualified for the}} 1972 U.S. Olympic team despite recovering from <b>a</b> bout <b>of</b> mononucleosis. At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, he represented the United States in three different events. Most memorably, McKee won a silver medal in the men's 400-meter individual medley in the closest swimming decision in Olympic history, losing by <b>a</b> margin <b>of</b> two one-thousandths (0.002) <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second to Sweden's Gunnar Larsson. Initially, the scoreboard showed that Larsson and McKee had tied with <b>an</b> official time <b>of</b> 4:31.98, but in a controversial decision, the event judges named Larsson the eventual gold medal-winner ten minutes after the race was over—Larsson's electronic clock time was 4:31.981, McKee's 4:31.983. The time difference was variously calculated as one-tenth of the time <b>of</b> <b>a</b> typical <b>blink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> human <b>eye,</b> and the distance as the thickness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> coat <b>of</b> paint, <b>a</b> sheet <b>of</b> paper, or the minor imperfections in the individual lanes of the Olympic pool. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> the controversy, the international swimming federation, FINA, subsequently clarified the timing rules for competition swimming; international races are now required to be timed to the hundredth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second, and timing to the thousandth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second is prohibited for tie-breakers. It {{was the first and}} only Olympic swimming event ever decided on the basis <b>of</b> thousandths <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second. Afterward, McKee attributed his second-place finish to a tactical mistake: he looked over his shoulder to see where Larsson was in the final leg of the race.|$|R
40|$|This article {{argues that}} Beijing is using its fishing and {{paramilitary}} fleets for geopolitical purposes by pursuing <b>a</b> strategy <b>of</b> “fish, protect, contest, and occupy”, designed to reinforce its sovereignty and resource claims over contested {{islands in the}} Western Pacific and coerce other claimants into acceptance of China’s position. Introduction Few doubt that China’s rise is this era’s principal driver of strategic change, just as the United States’ equally influential ascendancy shaped the last. But earlier optimism that the Middle Kingdom’s re-emergence as a major power would be largely benign is fading as evidence mounts that Beijing is determined to press its territorial and resource claims in the vitally important seas of the Western Pacific. In barely the <b>blink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> geopolitical <b>eye,</b> China’s once lauded charm offensive {{has given way to}} exactly the kind of coercive behavior its critics have long predicted. In a 3, 000 -mile maritime arc running from the East China Sea to the southern reaches of the South China Sea, Beijing is at loggerheads with many of its neighbors, including erstwhile friends, over several linked territorial and resource disputes. If not wisely managed, these disputes could bring East Asia’s long peace to a premature and bloody end. The need to protect vital maritime trade routes and secure energy resources that lie under the East and South China Seas goes some way to explaining China’s assertive approach to off-shore territorial disputes, including its claim to most of the South China Sea. But conventional narratives have largely ignored the significance of valuable marine living resources in catalyzing the dangerous mix of conflicts in the Western Pacific and the role of China’s fishing and paramilitary fleets (the various Chinese fleets responsible for fisheries protection, customs, maritime surveillance, law enforcement, and border security, many of which are armed and of substantial tonnage). In Chinese eyes, the rich fishing grounds of the East and South China seas are as critical to China’s future food security as oil and gas are to its energy future. With wild fish stocks in decline and demand rising, fish has become a strategic commodity to be protected and defended, if necessary, by force. In this article, we argue that Beijing is using its fishing and paramilitary fleets for geopolitical purposes by pursuing <b>a</b> strategy <b>of</b> “fish, protect, contest, and occupy”—designed to reinforce its sovereignty and resource claims over contested islands in the Western Pacific and coerce other claimants into compliance, and acceptance, of China’s position. If this policy does not reverse or moderate—and there are few signs that it will—the consequences could endanger regional stability and even China’s own long-term security...|$|R
