40|$|The DNA {{replication}} inhibitor peptide microcin B 17 {{is shown}} to be a useful tool for preparing Escherichia coli maxicells. To illustrate its usefulness, we have identified polypeptides synthesized from pMccB 17 and R 100 IncFII miniplasmids. After comparing the respective polypeptides and the miniplasmid restriction maps, we concluded that these plasmids share extensive homology in the <b>basic</b> <b>replicon</b> but are different for an adjacent region (parD) that is involved in plasmid stability and maintenance...|$|E
40|$|Plasmid R 1 is a low-copy-number plasmid that {{is present}} {{at a level}} of about four or five copies per average cell. The copy number is {{controlled}} posttranscriptionally at the level of synthesis of the rate-limiting initiator protein RepA. In addition to this, R 1 has an auxiliary system that derepresses a second promoter at low copy numbers, leading to increased repA mRNA synthesis. This promoter is normally switched off by a constitutively synthesized plasmid-encoded repressor protein, CopB; in cells with low copy numbers, the concentration of CopB is low and the promoter is derepressed. Here we show that the rate of loss of a Par derivative of the <b>basic</b> <b>replicon</b> of R 1 increased about sevenfold when the cells contained a high concentration of the CopB protein formed from a compatible plasmid. The <b>basic</b> <b>replicon</b> (the smallest part of a plasmid that is able to replicate and to have the normal copy number) of IncFII plasmid R 1 (13) consists of an origin of replication (oriR 1), the structural gene (repA) for a protein involved in initiation of replication, a gene for an antisense RNA (CopA) that post-transcriptionally controls expression of the repA mRNA, and the copB gene (Fig. 1 A).

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{physical and}} functional {{map of the}} chloramphenicol (Cm) resistance plasmid pC 223 from Staphylococcus aureus was compiled. The plasmid's <b>basic</b> <b>replicon</b> and origin of replication were located and their nucleotide sequences determined. Two small RNAs of 92 and 155 nt, demonstrated by in vitro transcription with vegetative Bacillus subtilis HNA polymerase, were depicted as copy number regulating (cop) and incompatibility (inc) functions in Bacillus subtilis. pC 223 and pUB 112, another S•aureus Cm resistance plasmid, which exhibits marked sequence homology with pC 223 and codes also for two small copRNAs, {{could be classified as}} members of the pT 181 -plasmid family (1). Copy numbers and segregational instability of pC 223, pUB 112 and deletion derivatives of both in B. subtilis showed great differences despite of their homologous basic replicons...|$|E
40|$|Virulence {{plasmids}} of 68 ETEC isolates from piglets {{belonging to}} different pathotypes and six ETEC isolates from calves with pathotypes typical of porcine ETEC were identified with seven virulence probes for the heat-stable (STa and STb) and heat-labile (LT) enterotoxins, for the F 4, F 5, F 6, and F 41 fimbrial adhesion subunit, {{and also with}} five Rep probes for the RepFIA and RepFIB <b>basic</b> <b>replicons,</b> and the RepFIC family of <b>basic</b> <b>replicons.</b> With {{the exception of the}} F 41 probe, the other virulence probes hybridized with at least one plasmid band of a size range from 65 to more than 100 Mda. Common associations of virulence factor-encoding genes on plasmid bands were: STb/LT, STa/F 5, STa/F 6, STa/STb. Other associations, STa/F 4, STa/F 4 /F 6, and STa/STb/LT/F 6, were rarer. On the other hand the F 4 adhesin-encoding genes were isolated on one plasmid band in all but three F 4 + isolates. All but one of the 92 virulence plasmids which were studied have Rep probe hybridization profiles and replicon types typical of the uni- or multireplicon plasmids belonging to the various incompatibility groups of the F incompatibility complex.

40|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>replicons</b> of {{bacterial}} plasmids consist of {{two sets of}} genetic systems, the replication-structural system and the replication control system. Comparison of nucleotide sequences suggested that the ba-sic replicons of plasmids P 307 (IncFI) and pMU 2200 (IncZ) were generated by reciprocal recombination between ancestors of R 100 (IncFII) and Collb-P 9 (Incla), or vice versa. The plasmids of each pair, P 307 /pMU 2200 and R 100 /Collb-P 9, are structurally unrelated to each other. Based on this informa-tion, we constructed in vitro and analyzed P 307 -like chimeric replicons from Collb-P 9 and R 100. When the replication-structural region of Collb-P 9 was combined with the whole replication control region of R 100, the resultant replicon replicated stably as R 100 did. These results revealed that the <b>basic</b> <b>replicons</b> of the plasmids diverged by exchanging their replication control systems. Thus, we propose that the replication control systems of plasmids, in some cases, evolved independently of their structural systems, although these two systems work together to maintain the replication functions. We also showed that the reciprocal recombination was specified by the unique secondary structures of RNA involved in the control of expression of the genes encoding the replication initiator proteins.

40|$|Using a {{sensitive}} primer extension technique, we have carried out studies to localize the start site of replication of the replicon RepFIC. In {{the course of}} these studies, we have found evidence that supports the hypothesis that transcription is an integral component of the initiation of replication. On {{the basis of our}} findings, we suggest that the transcript is processed to act as a primer, and therefore we propose that the transcript has a dual role as primer of replication and mRNA for the RepA 1 protein. We present a model, based on our evidence, for the initiation of replication of the replicon RepFIC. This model provides as well an alternative explanation for what has been called the cis action of RepA 1, and we show that RepA 1 may act in trans as well as in cis. Plasmid EntP 307 is a large (110 -kb) conjugative plasmid that was isolated from the porcine Escherichia coli strain P 307. This plasmid codes for two enterotoxins (heat labile and heat sta-ble) as well as those functions necessary for its own mainte-nance and transmission. EntP 307, like many plasmids of the IncF group, contains two replication regions or <b>basic</b> <b>replicons</b> (16), which are representative of the two types of replication control found in plasmids, namely, the iteron type and the antisense type. One (RepFIB), which we have used extensively in these studies as a cloning vector, is of the iteron type and is similar in its manner of control to the replicon RepFIA (mini-F) of F and to the <b>basic</b> <b>replicons</b> of R 6 K, RK 2, and P 1 (19). The other, RepFIC, which is the object of this study, is of the antisense type and is similar in its manner of control to the replicons of plasmids R 1 and R 100 in E. coli, and ColIb-P 9 in Shigella. The latter plasmids, including RepFIC, do not contain origin iterons and may therefore control their replication by a mechanism different from that used by iteron-type plasmids. Work on antisense replicons from several laboratories has led to some general conclusions that are illustrated in Fig. ...|$|R
40|$|Plasmid DNA {{hybridization}} with probes for virulence factors {{used for}} basic replicons of plasmids {{was used to}} identify the virulence plasmids {{of a collection of}} enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli isolates from cattle. The virulence probes were derived from the genes coding for the heat-stable enterotoxin STaP and for the F 5 (K 99) and F 41 fimbrial adhesins. The replicon probes were derived from 16 different basic replicons of plasmids (probes repFIA, repFIB, repFIC, repFIIA, repI 1, repHI 1, repHI 2, repL/M, repN, repP, repQ, repT, repU, repW, repX, and repY). The virulence genes coding for the STaP enterotoxin and for the F 5 adhesin were located on a single plasmid band in each isolate. The sizes of most of these virulence plasmids were from 65 to 95 MDa. The F 41 probe failed to hybridize with any plasmid band. The virulence plasmids had multireplicon types typical of plasmids of the IncF groups. The most common <b>basic</b> <b>replicon</b> association was the triple RepFIA-RepFIB-RepFIC family association...|$|E
40|$|We report {{here the}} {{isolation}} {{and analysis of}} novel repA host range mutants of pPS 10, a plasmid originally found in Pseudomonas savastanoi. Upon hydroxylamine treatment, five plasmid mutants were selected for their establishment in Escherichia coli at 37 °C, a temperature at which the wild-type form cannot be established. The mutations were located in different functional regions of the plasmid RepA initiation protein, and the mutants differ in their stable maintenance, copy number, and ability to interact with sequences of the <b>basic</b> <b>replicon.</b> Four of them have broadened their host range, and one of them, unable to replicate in Pseudomonas, has therefore changed its host range. Moreover, the mutants also have increased their replication efficiency in strains other than E. coli such as Pseudomonas putida and Alcaligenes faecalis. None of these mutations drastically changed the structure or thermal stability of the wild-type RepA protein, but in all cases an enhanced interaction with host-encoded DnaA protein was detected by gel filtration chromatography. The effects of the mutations on the functionality of RepA protein {{are discussed in the}} framework of a three-dimensional model of the protein. We propose possible explanations for the host range effect of the different repA mutants, including the enhancement of limiting interactions of RepA with specific host replication factors such as DnaA...|$|E
40|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>replicon</b> of plasmid pCU 1 {{contains}} {{three different}} replication origins. Replication initiated from the oriB origin requires pCU 1 -encoded protein RepA. Previously, information analysis of 19 natural RepA binding sequences predicted a 20 -bp sequence as a RepA binding site. Guanines contacting RepA {{in the major}} groove of DNA have also been determined. In this study, we used the missing-nucleoside method to determine all of the bases relevant to RepA binding. The importance of some thymine bases was also confirmed by a missing-thymine site interference assay. Participation of the 5 -methyl groups of two thymines (at positions − 6 and 7) in RepA binding was pointed out by a missing-thymine methyl site interference assay. Phosphate groups of the DNA backbone which strongly interfered with RepA binding upon ethylation were also identified. The pattern of contacting positions mapped by hydroxyl radical protection footprinting indicates that RepA binds to one face of B-form DNA. The length of the binding site {{was found to be}} 20 bp by dissociation rate measurement of complexes formed between RepA and a variety of binding sequences. The symmetry of the binding site and that of the contacting bases, particularly the reacting 5 -methyl groups of two thymines, suggest that pCU 1 -encoded RepA may contact its site as a homodimer...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiologically related, non-lactose-fermenting (NLF) Escherichia coli {{strains of}} {{serotype}} 04 have been isolated {{at a high}} frequency from children with diarrhea in Somalia (M. Nicoletti, F. Superti, C. Conti, A. Calconi, and C. Zagaglia, J. Clin. Microbiol. 26 : 524 - 529, 1988). In order to define the virulence potential of these strains, we characterized the replication properties of their high-molecular-weight plasmids and studied the genetic locations and organization of the aerobactin (aer) and hemolysin (hly) determinants encoded by 23 NLF 04 E. coli strains. Southern blot hybridizations, mobilization assays of nonconjugative plasmids, and incompatibility-exclusion experiments conducted with a conjugative incompatibility group FT (IncFI) plasmid showed that (i) 20 out of the 23 strains examined harbor a 160 - to 180 -kb IncFI plasmid that shares homology with the <b>basic</b> <b>replicons</b> RepFIA, RepFIB, and (except for the plasmid of one strain) RepFIC, and 22 strains also contain a 40 - to 140 -kb IncFIl plasmid sharing homology with the RepFlIA replicon; (ii) the IncFI plasmid is nonconjugative and carries antibiotic resistance genes; (iii) the aer system {{is located on the}} IncFI plasmids and/or the chromosomes in the three strains not harboring IncFI, and it is found in an inverted orientation; (iv) the hly determinants are located on the chromosome, and their genetic organization is well conserved and closely resembles that of the reference hemolytic plasmid pHly 152; and (v) Hl- mutants obtained by transposon insertion mutagenesis are not cytotoxic to HeLa cell monolayers, indicating that hemolysin i...|$|R
40|$|Pantoea agglomerans {{has been}} {{transformed}} from a commensal bacterium into two related gall-forming pathovars by acquisition of pPATH plasmids containing a pathogenicity island (PAI). This PAI harbors an hrp/hrc gene cluster, type III effectors, and phytohormone biosynthetic genes. DNA typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed two major groups of P. agglomerans pv. gypsophilae and one group of P. agglomerans pv. betae. The pPATH plasmids of the different groups had nearly identical replicons (98 % identity), and the RepA protein showed {{the highest level of}} similarity with IncN plasmid proteins. A series of plasmids, designated pRAs, in which the whole replicon region (2, 170 bp) or deleted derivatives of it were ligated with nptI were generated for <b>replicon</b> analysis. A <b>basic</b> 929 -bp <b>replicon</b> (pRA 6) was sufficient for replication in Escherichia coli and in nonpathogenic P. agglomerans. However, the whole replicon region (pRA 1) was necessary for expulsion of the pPATH plasmid, which resulted in the loss of pathogenicity. The presence of direct repeats in the replicon region suggests that the pPATH plasmid is an iteron plasmid and that the repeats may regulate its replication. The pPATH plasmids are nonconjugative but exhibit a broad host range, as shown by replication of pRA 1 in Erwinia, Pseudomonas, and Xanthomonas. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses indicated that the PAIs in the two groups of P. agglomerans pv. gypsophilae are similar but different from those in P. agglomerans pv. betae. The results could indicate that the pPATH plasmids evolved from a common ancestral mobilizable plasmid that was transferred into different strains of P. agglomerans...|$|R
40|$|Shigella {{species and}} enteroinvasive Escherichia coli strains carry a large (120 - to 140 -megadalton) plasmid called pINV, which {{contains}} genes {{essential for the}} invasiveness of these pathogens. Hybridization with specific probes derived from the RepFIC and RepFIB replicons of the IncF 1 Ent plasmid P 307 showed that pINVs present in 35 clinical isolates are homologous with RepFIC but not RepFIB, regardless of the serogroup of the Shigella or E. coli strain. RepFIC of P 307, in turn, {{is very similar to}} RepFIIA replicons of IncFII R plasmids. These and other related replicons constitute the RepFIIA family. With one pINV, pWR 110, a plasmid of Shigella flexneri 5, we demonstrated the existence of a functional replicon, RepINV, with a restriction map similar to that of RepFIIA of plasmid R 1. We isolated the putative inc RNA coding region of RepINV, which is a major determinant of incompatibility. The nucleotide sequence of the RepINV-inc RNA-coding region was determined and compared with the corresponding sequences of RepFIC and RepFIIA. The differences were small, but apparently were sufficient to affect the target specificity of the inc RNAs, thus rendering the replicons compatible with each other. We conclude that pINVs present in Shigella spp. and enteroinvasive E. coli constitute a homogeneous group, containing one <b>basic</b> <b>replicon</b> that belongs to the RepFIIA family of replicons...|$|E
40|$|The binding between par+ and par plasmid DNA to {{different}} membrane fractions of Escherichia coli was investigated. Membrane material from cells carrying different Par+ and Par- derivatives of plasmids R 1 and pSC 101 was isolated and fractionated into an outer and a cytoplasmic membrane fraction. The presence of plasmid DNA {{in the two}} membrane fractions was measured either by nick-translation of the membrane-bound DNA, followed by filter-hybridization to homologous DNA, or by filter-hybridization of the membrane-bound DNA to nick-translated homologous purified plasmid DNA. The DNA of par derivatives of plasmids R 1 and pSC 101 could be detected only in the cytoplasmic membrane fraction, whereas the corresponding par+ plasmid DNA also appeared in the outer membrane material, indicating a specific binding between the R 1 and pSC 101 partition loci and the bacterial outer membrane. The experiment was then modified by fractionation of the membrane material from cells carrying hybrids between the vector pSF 2124 and the par region or the <b>basic</b> <b>replicon</b> region of plasmid R 1. The DNA of the membrane fractions were filter-hybridized to nick-translated probes. Again, the par+ region caused hybridization to the outer membrane material. Therefore, we may conclude that controlled partitioning involves binding of DNA to membrane material that has the same density as the outer membrane of the host bacteria. This finding offers a biochemical 'assay' for studies of the molecular biology of plasmid partitioning...|$|E
40|$|A 5 -kbp {{region of}} pAD 1, {{previously}} {{shown to be}} capable of supporting replication, copy control, and stable inheritance of the plasmid, was cloned into a replicon probe vector and subjected to transposon insertional mutagenesis. Transposon inserts identifying essential replication, copy control, and stability functions were isolated. Deletion of stability functions not essential for replication resulted in delimitation of a <b>basic</b> <b>replicon.</b> The complete DNA sequence of this approximately 3 -kbp region and the precise positions of several transposon inserts were determined, and the phenotypic effects of the transposon inserts were correlated with the physical locations of individual determinants. The following three genes, apparently involved in plasmid maintenance, were identified; repA, which encodes a protein required for replication; repB, which encodes a protein involved in copy control; and repC, which may be involved in stable inheritance. In addition, two clusters of repeats composed of a consensus sequence, TAGTARRR, were identified, one located between the divergently transcribed repA and repB genes and another located downstream of repC. The region between repA and repB contained 25 repeats divided into two subregions of 13 and 12 repeats separated by 78 bp. The region located downstream of repC contained only three repeats but may be essential for plasmid replication, since deletion of this determinant resulted in loss of ability to replicate in Enterococcus faecalis. We hypothesize that the repeat units represent protein-binding sites required for assembly of the replisome and control of plasmid copy number. Another region of unrelated repeat units that may also be involved in replication is located within the repA gene. Possible mechanisms of action of these determinants are discussed...|$|E
40|$|RepFIC is a <b>basic</b> <b>replicon</b> of IncFI plasmid P 307 {{which is}} located within a 3. 09 -kilobase SmaI fragment. The {{nucleotide}} sequence of this region has been determined and shown to be homologous with the RepFIIA replicon of IncFII plasmids. The two replicons share three homologous regions, HRI, HRII, and HRIII, which are flanked by two nonhomologous regions, NHRI and NHRII. A comparison of coding regions reveals that the two replicons have several features in common. RepFIC, like RepFIIA, codes for a repA 2 protein with its amino-terminal codons in HRI and its carboxy-terminal codons in NHRI. Although the codons for the repA 1 proteins are located in NHRII, the DNA region containing a putative promoter, ribosomal binding site, and initiation codons is located in HRII. This region also codes for an inc RNA. There are nine base-pair differences between the inc RNA of RepFIIA and that of RepFIC, and as a result, RepFIC and RepFIIA replicons are compatible. An EcoRI fragment from the F plasmid which shows homology with RepFIC of P 307 has also been sequenced. This fragment contains {{only a portion of}} RepFIC, including the genes for the putative repA 2 protein and inc RNA. The region coding for a putative repA 1 protein is interrupted by the transposon Tn 1000 and shows no homology with the repA 1 region of RepFIIA and RepFIC of P 307. Our comparative and structural analyses suggest that RepFIC and RepFIIA, although different, have a similar replication mechanism and thus can be assigned to the same replicon family, which we designate the RepFIIA family...|$|E
40|$|Plasmid pBSSB 1 is a 27 kb linear DNA with {{proteins}} attached at the 5 ’ termini. It encodes the H: z 66 flagellar antigen in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) {{isolated from}} Indonesia. Together with the H: j or H: d flagellar antigen encoded by the host chromosome, pBSSB 1 renders {{expression of the}} flagellar antigen biphasic in S. Typhi. Following the discovery of pBSSB 1, initial bioinformatic analyses were carried out. However, no genetic analysis of replication and stability functions was conducted. Such studies {{form the basis of}} the present work. Plasmid pBSSB 2, that contains a kanamycin cassette inserted at position 1295 bp of pBSSB 1, was used in the present investigation. The first objective of the work was to develop a method of purification for the linear plasmid. Conventional plasmid extraction methods which had been used previously were found to produce a very poor yield of plasmid DNA. It was shown in the present study that a proteinase-K treatment was essential for the removal of the linear plasmid terminal proteins to avoid loss of the plasmid in the phenol-chloroform-isoamylalcohol treatment which removes cellular proteins from the plasmid DNA. The region containing the <b>basic</b> <b>replicon</b> of pBSSB 2 was identified by screening for a region that was able to support replication in E. coli of a ColE 1 -like plasmid in a polA host (in which it would not normally replicate). This identified a 2831 bp fragment encompassing nucleotides 12820 to 15649 of pBSSB 2. It was expected that this would encode an initiator of replication such as a Rep protein. However, mutagenesis studies showed that none of the annotated ORFs in this fragment was essential for replication. Candidate ORFs, not identified in the original annotation, have been suggested that remain to be tested as possible candidates for the rep encoding gene. The possibility of an alternative RNA primed initiation of replication has also been hypothesized. An adjacent region was found to exert strong incompatibility against pBSSB 2, suggesting that it might encode a repressor of replication. The minimum region conferring incompatibility was 179 bp, encompassing nucleotides 10840 bp to 11018 bp of pBSSB 2. A six base pair imperfect repeat, (G/T) (G/A) TGTT was found within this sequence. It is hypothesized that these imperfect repeats may function as iterons that titrate a Rep protein and regulate pBSSB 2 replication. A 1023 bp region (nucleotides 7236 to 8258 of pBSSB 2) was found to confer stability in E. coli upon an otherwise unstable circular plasmid. Mutational analysis showed that an annotated ORF within this region (ORF 09) was required for plasmid stabilisation. When expressed independently from an expression vector ORF 09 killed host cells. It is proposed that the stability function acts as a toxin-antitoxin system, although the antitoxin has not yet been identified. A candidate promoter for a putative countertranscript and two potential ORFs as candidates for encoding the antitoxin have been suggested for future work to identify the antitoxin. The preliminary functional characterization of pBSSB 2 has contributed to our general understanding of the replication and stability functions of linear plasmids. However, further work will be required to achieve a complete understanding of the molecular basis of these functions in pBSSB 2...|$|E
