25|$|<b>Biological</b> <b>transmission</b> {{requires}} {{a period of}} incubation of the trypanosomes within the tsetse host. The term 'biological' is used because trypanosomes must reproduce through several generations inside the tsetse host {{during the period of}} incubation, which requires extreme adaptation of the trypanosomes to their tsetse host. In this mode of transmission, trypanosomes reproduce through several generations, changing in morphology at certain periods. This mode of transmission also includes the sexual phase of the trypanosomes. Tsetse are believed to be more likely to become infected by trypanosomes during their first few blood meals.

25|$|The {{cycle of}} <b>biological</b> <b>transmission</b> of trypanosomiasis {{involves}} two phases, one inside the tsetse host {{and the other}} inside the vertebrate host. Trypanosomes are not passed between a pregnant tsetse and her offspring, so all newly emerged tsetse adults are free of infection. An uninfected fly that feeds on an infected vertebrate animal may acquire trypanosomes in its proboscis or gut. These trypanosomes, depending on the species, may remain in place, move to {{a different part of}} the digestive tract, or migrate through the tsetse body into the salivary glands. When an infected tsetse bites a susceptible host, the fly may regurgitate part of a previous blood meal that contains trypanosomes, or may inject trypanosomes in its saliva.

We provide upper and lower bounds on the entropy for the minimum entropy distribution over arbitrarily large collections of binary units with any fixed set of mean values and pairwise correlations. We also construct specific low-entropy distributions for several relevant cases. Surprisingly, the minimum entropy solution has entropy scaling logarithmically with system size for any set of first- and second-order statistics consistent with arbitrarily large systems. We further demonstrate that some sets of these low-order statistics can only be realized by small systems. Our results show how only small amounts of randomness are needed to mimic low-order statistical properties of highly entropic distributions, and we discuss some applications for engineered and <b>biological</b> information <b>transmission</b> systems.

With this in mind we have prepared and characterised AuNPs functionalised with phosphonium groups derived from either triarylphosphoniopropylthiosulfate zwitterions or ω-thioacetylpropyl(triphenyl) phosphonium salts; organophosphonium cations display remarkable lipophilicity and are readily taken up by cells and are concentrated in the mitochondria.

50|$|In biological, but not cultural, {{transmissions}} {{the carriers}} (also known as vectors) may include other species. The two main biological modes of transmission are anterior station and posterior station. In anterior station, transmission occurs via {{the bite of}} an infected organism (the vector), like in malaria, dengue fever, and bubonic plague. Posterior station is transmission via contact with infected feces. Examples are rickettsiae driven diseases (like typhus), which are contracted by a body louse's fecal material being scratched into the bloodstream. The vector is not necessarily another species, however. For example, a dog infected with Rabies may infect another dog via anterior station transmission. Moreover, there are other modes of <b>biological</b> <b>transmission,</b> such as generalized bleeding in ebola.|$|E

40|$|Background: Although {{cockroaches}} are mechanical vector of many pathogens, still <b>biological</b> <b>transmission</b> of pathogens via these insects is controversial. More covenant immune {{defense in}} the hemolymph of cockroaches may take this ad&shy;vantage to block any adaptation of pathogens regarding to <b>biological</b> <b>transmission.</b> Lectin molecules in hemolymph of in&shy;sects play as mediators of nonself recognition, in the innate immune response. Methods: Initially, lectin-carbohydrate interactions in hemolymph of American cockroach, Periplaneta, americana, have been investigated {{and then as a}} model, non pathogenic soil bacterium, Streptomyces griseus was used to specify the cock&shy;roach hemolymph reaction. Results: The results showed that the hemolymph lectin activities were inhibited with GlcNAc, galactose, mannose, arabi&shy;nose, and fucose but not with fructose, lactose and glucose. Also, S. griseus cells were agglutinated with the cockroach hemo&shy;lymph while in the presence of fructose, mannose and galactose, the agglutinin activities were inhibited. &nbsp; Introducing the soil bacterium, S. griseus, into the hemolymph increased both the lectin activities as well as the number of hemocytes from an average 101 to 2688 cells per milliliter hemolymph 6 days after injection. At the same time, the number of pro&shy;hemocytes in the hemolymph declined while the granular cell numbers rapidly increased. Conclusion: Generally injecting S. griseus into the cockroach body resulted in a positive correlation between an increase in hemo&shy;lymph titers and enhancement of hemocyte numbers.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We present {{molecular}} dynamics simulations of bovine rhodopsin in a membrane mimetic environment {{based on the}} recently refined X-ray structure of the pigment. The interactions between the protonated Schiff base and the protein moiety are explored both with the chromophore in the dark-adapted 11 -cis and in the photoisomerized all-trans form. Comparison of simulations with Glu 181 in different protonation states strongly suggests that this loop residue located close to the 11 -cis bond bears a negative charge. Restrained {{molecular dynamics}} simulations also provide evidence that the protein tightly confines the absolute conformation of the retinal around the C 12 -C 13 bond to a positive helicity. 11 -cis to all-trans isomerization leads to an internally strained chromophore, which relaxes after a few nanoseconds by a switching of the ionone ring to an essentially planar all-trans conformation. This structural transition of the retinal induces in turn significant conformational changes of the protein backbone, especially in helix VI. Our results suggest a possible molecular mechanism for the early steps of intramolecular signal transduction in a prototypical G-protein-coupled receptor.

Mitigation of such kind of distortion can be achieved through equalization filter. Recently an adaptive blind channel equalization using sinusoidally-distributed dithered signed-error constant modulus algorithm (DSE-CMA) has been proposed. In this paper we investigate the performance and the feasibility of this scheme for wireless ECG and EEG transmission. Also, this paper discusses the importance of adaptive blind equalizer for <b>biological</b> signals <b>transmission</b> over existing wireless networks such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and the Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE).
