40|$|In a mini-review [Physica A 392 (2013) 5261 [...] 5282] it {{has been}} shown that {{classical}} traffic flow theories and models failed to explain empirical traffic breakdown [...] a phase transition from metastable free flow to synchronized flow at highway bottlenecks. The main objective of this mini-review is to study the consequence of this failure of classical traffic-flow theories for an analysis of empirical stochastic highway capacity as well as for the effect of automatic <b>driving</b> <b>vehicles</b> and cooperative <b>driving</b> on traffic flow. To reach this goal, we show a deep connection between the understanding of empirical stochastic highway capacity and a reliable analysis of automatic <b>driving</b> <b>vehicles</b> in traffic flow. With the use of simulations in the framework of three-phase traffic theory, a probabilistic analysis of the effect of automatic <b>driving</b> <b>vehicles</b> on a mixture traffic flow consisting of a random distribution of automatic driving and manual <b>driving</b> <b>vehicles</b> has been made. We have found that the parameters of automatic <b>driving</b> <b>vehicles</b> can either decrease or increase the probability of traffic breakdown. The increase in the probability of traffic breakdown, i. e., the deterioration of the performance of the traffic system can occur already at a small percentage (about 5 %) of automatic <b>driving</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The increase in the probability of traffic breakdown through automatic <b>driving</b> <b>vehicles</b> can be realized, even if any platoon of automatic <b>driving</b> <b>vehicles</b> satisfies condition for string stability.

Second, under the driving condition of class B road excitations and a speed of 50 [*]Km/h, the vibration characteristics of the in-wheel motor <b>driving</b> <b>vehicle</b> are simulated and analyzed, and the activity of each part in the system is then calculated. Third, these parts that have less of an effect on the vibration characteristics of an in-wheel motor <b>driving</b> <b>vehicle</b> are identified according to the magnitude of the activity, and then the model is simplified by removing these parts. Finally, the reliability of the simplified model is verified by comparing the vibration characteristics of the model before and after simplification. This study can provide a method for the modeling and simulation of the vibration characteristics of the in-wheel motor <b>driving</b> <b>vehicle...</b>|$|R

40|$|We have {{revealed}} physical features of autonomous {{driving in the}} framework of the three-phase traffic theory {{for which there is no}} fixed time headway to the preceding vehicle. A comparison with the classical model approach to autonomous driving for which an autonomous <b>driving</b> <b>vehicle</b> tries to reach a fixed (desired or "optimal") time headway to the preceding vehicle has been made. It turns out that autonomous driving {{in the framework of}} the three-phase traffic theory exhibits the following advantages in comparison with the classical model of autonomous driving: (i) The absence of string instability. (ii) Considerably smaller speed disturbances at road bottlenecks. (iii) Autonomous <b>driving</b> <b>vehicles</b> based on the three-phase theory decrease the probability of traffic breakdown at the bottleneck in mixed traffic flow consisting of human driving and autonomous driving vehicles; on the contrary, even a single autonomous <b>driving</b> <b>vehicle</b> based on the classical approach can provoke traffic breakdown at the bottleneck in mixed traffic flow.
