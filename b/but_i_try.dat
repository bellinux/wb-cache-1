500|$|Meat Loaf {{says that}} he does not enjoy {{recording}} in studios. He compares the process to [...] "going to the dentist and having root canal everyday". Whereas you really have to be flat for people to notice it in a live show, in a studio, every [...] "nuance is under a microscope... and I'm a perfectionist who knows that there's no such thing as perfection <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to get as close as I can." ...|$|E
2500|$|Breslow {{was born}} in New Haven, Connecticut, and raised in Trumbull, Connecticut. [...] He is Jewish, and {{attended}} Hebrew school. [...] His family attended Congregation B'nai Israel in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where he had his bar mitzvah in 1993. [...] He has fasted while pitching on Yom Kippur, and noted: [...] "Being Jewish is more difficult in baseball ... <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to do what I can in terms of paying attention to holidays." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blackman {{attended}} a Baptist church during her teenage years, but became {{a follower of}} the Bahá'í Faith {{at the age of}} 18; she also started studying Kabbalah in the 2000s. Blackman cultivates spirituality in her musicianship. [...] "I believe that music is so sacred that once you're playing music you are doing the work of prayer, whether you're conscious of it or not, because you have a focused intent", says Blackman. [...] "You transcend, because you're crossing barriers {{that a lot of people}} and even us as musicians don't normally venture to, because we don't think about it. When you can learn to move those energies, even if they're sad, into something that is of benefit, like focusing on bringing light to people who are listening, or just to the universe in general, then you can do something good with it. I don't keep that in mind 100 per cent of the time – I'm human – <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to." ...|$|E

60|$|If she {{persisted in}} her {{determination}} to leave me, she should know my love in two minutes. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> further persuasion.|$|R
60|$|I made {{no answer}} to that, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to show him by my bearing that I {{was ready for the}} worst which could befall me.|$|R
2500|$|Fahima Haque of The Washington Post, Bim Adewunmi of The Guardian, and Christopher Rosen of The Huffington Post all {{reiterate}} {{the fact}} that Rue and Thresh are described in The Hunger Games as having dark brown skin, as well as Collins's assertion that they were intended to be depicted as African Americans. Adewunmi remarked that [...] "it comes to this: if the casting of Rue, Thresh and Cinna has left you bewildered and upset, consider two things. One: {{you may be a}} racist—congrats! Two: you definitely lack basic reading comprehension. Mazel tov!" [...] Erik Kain of Forbes saw the controversy as a way to appreciate the value of free speech. He states that while society may never be free of racism, [...] "racist comments made on Facebook and Twitter quickly become public record. Aggregations of these comments, like the Jezebel piece, expose people for what they are. Sure, many hide under the cloak of anonymity, but many others cannot or choose not to. And as the internet becomes more civilized and its denizens more accountable, this sort of thing carries more and more weight." [...] Amandla Stenberg responded to the controversy with the following statement: [...] "As a fan of the books, I feel fortunate to be part of The Hunger Games family... It was an amazing experience; I am proud of the film and my performance. I {{want to thank all of}} my fans and the entire Hunger Games community for their support and loyalty." [...] Dayo Okeniyi was quoted saying [...] "I think this is a lesson for people to think before they tweet" [...] and [...] "It's sad... We could now see where society is today. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> not to think about stuff like that." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not quite," [...] he answered. [...] "I'll {{confess that}} I'm not {{satisfied}} yet, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> {{to make the}} most of the good things that come along--and I'm glad I got up early. It's a glorious morning!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Regarding the EP's track listing, Tatum noted, [...] "Some of {{the songs}} are very poppy <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to make them stranger, awkward or weird at certain points." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' I protested, 'I {{hated her}} and despised her; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to forget you; and I {{wanted you to}} feel certain that I no longer cared for you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> know. <b>But</b> {{she never}} was equal to him. I saw {{that from the}} start; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to blind myself to it. And when he kept coming----" ...|$|R

6000|$|DEAR HENLEY, [...] . I am {{not worth}} an old damn. I am also crushed by bad news of Symonds; his good lung going; I cannot help reading it as a {{personal}} hint; God help us all! Really I am not very fit for work; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try,</b> try, and nothing comes of it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'January 28th.--The nine young Christians were baptized on Sunday evening; a very {{touching}} and solemn service it was, very full of comfort.

6000|$|I {{fixed the}} floor. There indeed <b>I</b> was. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to stay there--just there only--as {{short a time}} as possible. Something, moreover, after all, caught me up. [...] "But if Brissenden already knew----?" ...|$|R
60|$|DE LEVIS. Yes. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> {{her pretty}} high the other day; and she's in the Cambridgeshire. I was only {{out of my}} room {{a quarter of an}} hour, and I locked my door.|$|R
60|$|We {{were all}} on the alert. There was a pause; a deep breath. I was horribly frightened, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to look calm. Then sharp and quick came the one word 'Go!' And like arrows from a bow, off we all started.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, ma'am, it {{made the}} day go on well like, and settled a body's mind, when I fretted for what could not be helped. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> not to fret after it now, and Mr. Hazlewood said, if I did my best {{wherever}} I was, the Lord would still join our prayers together." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You can learn; I did. I used to croak and fret dreadfully, and get so unhappy, I was n't fit for anything. I do {{it still}} more than I ought, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> not to, and it gets easier, I find. Get a-top of your troubles, and then they are half cured, Miss Mills says." ...|$|E
6000|$|Pulling himself together, Dick {{gave her}} a steady look. [...] "I can't let that pass, though if I begin to argue I'm lost. In a way, I'm at your mercy, because my defense can only make matters worse. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to explain on board the launch." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thanks,' she replied. 'No, I {{ought not}} to have said that. I leave him to God, and my poor Nuttie. I {{want you to tell}} her, if I can't, what she must try to do. If <b>I</b> had <b>but</b> brought them {{together}} more! <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> for the best.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps it was wrong, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to do right. I wasn't sure, no {{one said}} anything, and I hoped I was mistaken. It would have been selfish to frighten you all when Marmee was so anxious about Meg, and Amy away, and you so happy with Laurie--at least I thought so then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll let Grace's notion go. My form {{is not my}} step-children's, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to {{moderate}} my remarks about women.

6000|$|... "Oh! yes--I {{know she}} thinks {{a good deal}} of that, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to set her heart at ease, poor, dear, old grandmother, for it's of no use to be {{distressing}} herself about me! I can take care of myself well enough, and have plenty of friends who will never see me want. Father's sisters say they'll take care of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{allow it}} to do that. A detective is a man, you know, much like other men, and I have always held that the better man he is the better detective he is sure to prove. I'm obliged to do disagreeable things, at times, in the {{fulfillment}} of my duty, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to spare even the most hardened criminal as much as possible. So why shouldn't I be kind to a helpless, unfortunate girl?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I've been {{praising the}} beauties of Indian Art all my days." [...] It {{was a little}} disappointing {{when you come to}} think of it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to console myself by the thought that the two lay so far apart there was no {{comparison}} possible. And yet accuracy is surely the touchstone of all Art.|$|R
40|$|My {{thesis is}} about {{strategy}} generation and its {{importance for the}} company.

40|$|This was a rush job on a {{spontaneous}} trip. It {{was not possible}} to stay long or to meet with just one person. The whole recording is rather chaotic.

6000|$|... "I am twice twelve, and {{not entirely}} cured yet; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try,</b> and don't mean to wear blue {{spectacles}} if I can help it," [...] answered the lady, laughing so blithely that Marjorie {{was sure she}} would not have to try much longer.

[...] He really did feel mean about it. [...] "Don't take 'em--wait till to-morrow. They're pretty middling bad anyway.

6000|$|When he had {{fastened}} himself securely, {{which he}} did with great rapidity, the man spoke, saying, [...] "Your Majesty has found us as busy as ever.

6000|$|... "Yes. I didn't {{believe in}} it <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> it.

But one day last week I just happened to look at my hands and there wasn't a wart to be seen. It was the most amazing thing." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{started down}} toward the office, {{and on the way}} {{encountered}} another bosom friend, who told me that a quart of salt-water, taken warm, would come as near curing a cold as anything in the world.

6000|$|... "The name? Gian was wont to make {{bad work}} of our honest German names, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to learn this--being so beholden to him.
