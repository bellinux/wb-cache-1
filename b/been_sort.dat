You also want to choose something that reflects not just the mood of the record, but the mood of the people who made it... the mood of those people when they recorded it, and there were quite a few things that sort of came up as ideas, but Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action seemed to sum it up best. It's probably the most positive record we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since before we had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've <b>been</b> <b>sort</b> of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much.|$|E
25|$|I have an {{obsession}} with death and sex. Those two things are also the nexus of horror films, which I've been obsessing over lately. I’ve been watching horror movies and 1950s science fiction movies. My re-release is called The Fame Monster so I've just <b>been</b> <b>sort</b> of bulimically eating and regurgitating monster movies and all things scary. I've just been noticing a resurgence of this idea of monster, of fantasy, but {{in a very real}} way. If you notice in those films, there’s always a juxtaposition of sex with death. That's what makes it so scary. Body and mind are primed for orgasm and instead somebody gets killed. That's the sort of sick, twisted psychological circumstance.|$|E
500|$|As soon as Hemingway {{returned}} to Finca Vigía in Cuba, he {{began work on}} a book about the safari, wanting to write while it was still vivid in his memory. [...] He quickly wrote 10,000 words, despite his pain (eventually the manuscript grew to about 800 pages). In September 1954, Hemingway wrote in a letter, [...] "At present I work at about 1/2 the capacity I should but everything is better all the time." [...] However, three months later in late December he wrote in a letter: [...] "This has <b>been</b> <b>sort</b> of a rough year.... We call this 'black-ass' and one should never have it. [...] But I get tired of pain sometimes, even if that is an ignoble feeling." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some of {{the metaphysical}} {{disputes}} and speculations include, for example, attempts to back Teilhard de Chardin's earlier {{interpretation of the}} universe as being christ centered (compare Omega Point), expressing a creatio evolutiva instead the elder notion of creatio continua. From a strictly secular, humanist perspective, it allows as well to put human beings back in the center, an anthropogenic shift in cosmology. [...] Karl W.

2500|$|Lastly, in {{the late}} 1990s, a new Internet fad began, owing to simplistic {{software}} development kits such as the Japanese RPG Maker series (1988 onwards). Influenced by console RPGs and based mostly on the gameplay and style of the SNES and Sega Genesis games, {{a large group of}} young programmers and aficionados across the world began creating independent console-style computer RPGs and sharing them online. An early successful example was Corpse Party (1996), a survival horror indie game created using the RPG Maker engine. Much like the survival horror adventure games Clock Tower (1995 onwards) and later Haunting Ground (2005), the player characters in Corpse Party lack any means of defending themselves; the game also featured up to 20 possible endings. However, the game would not be released in Western markets until 2011. In an interview with GameDaily in 2007, MTVN's Dave Williams remarked that, [...] "Games like this [...] have <b>been</b> <b>sort</b> of under the radar for something that could be the basis of a business. We have the resources and we can afford to invest more... I think it's {{going to be a great}} thing for the consumer." ...|$|E
