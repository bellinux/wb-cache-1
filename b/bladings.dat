The objective of this {{doctoral thesis}} is to develop the necessary design criteria based on an improved more in-depth understanding of individual phenomena as well as on the loss mechanisms. The numerical and experimental investigations of four highly loaded turbine cascades are broken down into two problems. On the one hand, two turbine cascades with identical overall aerodynamic loading, but different axial load distributions, were used to investigate the influence of airfoil pressure distribution on secondary flow formation and loss mechanisms. The subject of the second part of this research project is to clarify the role of the horseshoe vortex with respect to secondary flow field development in turbine <b>bladings.</b> For this purpose, the flow fields of two turbine cascades with identical overall loading and greatly the same load distribution were compared. The horseshoe vortex was greatly avoided in the so-called 'model cascade' by a very sharp leading edge geometry and very low airfoil thickness.

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{reduction}} of tonal noise annoyance from axial flow rotors is presented {{which is based on}} the uneven circumferential blade spacing. After a short description of the basic theory of the tonal noise generation from turbomachinery <b>bladings,</b> the existing methods for the circumferential spacing choice are analyzed and their practical drawbacks pointed out. A new systematic approach is presented in which a large number of balanced geometries are generated and then evaluated by means of an arbitrary objective function. To test the method, several objective functions have been calculated and the effect of the main parameters has been analyzed. Finally an optimized rotor representative of automotive applications has been realized and tested in the Johnson Electric- GATE semianechoic room in presence of a strong upstream velocity perturbation. The resulting acoustic pressure power spectra have been compared with those of an evenly spaced rotor equipped with the same blades, thus allowing for estimating the interference function of the unevenly spaced rotor. The good agreement with the theoretically expected trend proves that even in presence of strong velocity perturbation the obtained acoustic pressure power spectrum changes according to the theory which may thus be employed...|$|E

The study has been carried out using a novel, transition-sensitive, turbulence model. It is based on the coupling of additional transport equations, one for the so-called laminar kinetic energy (LKE) and one for a turbulence indicator function, with an algebraic Reynolds stress formulation based on the k−ω model.

The problems confronting a turbine designer arc blade and shaft vibrations, bending and centrifugal stresses, torsional analyses {{as well as}} optimal designing {{with respect to the}} requirement of attaining high efficiencies. With the help of advanced technologies, the steam turbine industry has reached a level where both reliability and high efficiencies are achieved. Better scaling properties achieved through the use of shrouded <b>bladings</b> with sealing strips on stator and rotor rows, as well as perfect damping of the blades by means of individual shrouding members fitted to the shorter blades and damping wires mounted on the longer blades are among some of the outstanding improvements made to achieve these goals. These changes have been incorporated in more than 120 turbines which are in operation and not a single blade failure has yet been reported. The use of guide-blade carriers is favourable because of their high thermoelasticity, a circumstance that allows for fast load changes without endangering the blading with regard to radial and axial contacting. A quick replacement with spare parts is also a remarkable advantage...|$|E
40|$|The {{unsteady}} flow within a two-stage low-pressure research turbine equipped with high lift profiles {{has been investigated}} in detail for three different aerodynamic loading conditions. Experiments {{have been carried out}} at low speed. Velocity and turbulence intensity in the blade-to-blade plane at midspan have been measured by means of a crossed hot-wire probe, upstream and downstream of each blade row. The probe has been traversed circumferentially over 1. 5 <b>bladings</b> pitch and the phase-locked data acquisition and ensemble average technique have been used to reconstruct the flow in space and time. The effects of multistage configuration have been identified and analyzed by considering the velocity components and turbulence intensity. Potential interaction from the downstream blading in relative motion, periodic wake perturbations from the upstream blading and preceding stage perturbations make the flow in the second stage extremely complex. Overall the flow downstream of rotors is perturbed in space by upstream and downstream stators, while flow downstream of stators is mostly perturbed in time by rotor effects. As expected, high lift profiles are significantly sensitive to incidence variation, with this effect further enhanced by the multistage cumulative interactions...|$|E
40|$|Turbomachinery blade {{profiles}} {{in use today}} were all derived out of conventional methods. For example an impulse blading of a turbine is derived out of multi circular arcs of different radii for, suction surface and pressure surface with a suitable leading and trailing edge radii. The reaction <b>bladings</b> were designed purely out of empirism based {{on the amount of}} acceleration or Gulf factor i. e., the ratio of throat opening to pitch (Ref-l),where as compressor blade profiles were derived by imposing a suitable c r on a known base profile with a chosen thickness distribution. The performance of these profiles were assessed by conducting series of experiments which involves the measurement of surface velocity distribution and profile loss. From the experimental results each profile can be given a tag of operating range. Selection of blade profile for a given velocity distribution involves the complete scanning of experimental results, which becomes tedious and time consuming. Now a days many theoretical methods are available to evaluate the performance of the blade profile. These methods were extensively used to update the blade profiles originated during the early decades. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of the flow through the labyrinth seals with the shaft of the rotor can {{have an effect on}} the stability of turbomachines. Thus, the excited forces, so-called cross forces or nonconservative forces, arise, which act perpendicular to the rotor eccentricity. This effect is caused by an unsymmetrical pressure distribution within the labyrinth cavities. Experimental studies were carried out for different types of labyrinth geometries: two staggered labyrinths with teeth on the stator and grooved rotor as well as a full and a convergent stepped labyrinth. These labyrinths can be found on the tip shrouding of <b>bladings</b> in steam or gas turbines. The following parameters were varied in the test facility: geometry of the labyrinth seals (number of cavities, inlet region), shaft rotation, pressure difference on the seal, entry swirl and eccentricity of the rotor. The results are presented for stiffness coefficients of the labyrinth seals, leakage flow and circumferential flow in each cavity which was measured with special probes. Generally, the inlet swirl has the greatest influence on the coefficients of the seals. The experimental results were compared with theoretical results and were in good agreement...|$|E
40|$|Both cascade and {{isolated}} airfoil methods are considered valid in axial fan blade design, for high (σ≳ 1) and low (σ≲ 0. 7) solidities respectively. For <b>bladings</b> that feature intermediate solidities the modified isolated approach is commonly employed. This method uses isolated airfoil data, with proper adjustments {{to take into}} account multiplane interference effects. Contrarily, the literature does not refer about modifications of the cascade approach to design medium solidity fans. Such method would use cascade data, properly adjusted for the blade sections at lower solidities. Thus, with the aim of comparing these two opposite design approaches (modified cascade versus modified isolated) for medium solidity blades, two free-vortex blading were designed for a 315 mm rotor-only axial fan and experimentally tested. CFD analyses were performed as well to obtain the local flow features. NACA- 65 series airfoils were employed, as both cascade {{and isolated}} data are available for chord Reynolds numbers typical of axial fans applications. Results highlight {{the differences between the two}} approaches. Finally, a mixed approach that employs both isolated and cascade data is suggested as the most accurate one. Moreover, results also show the detrimental effects of the low chord Reynolds numbers on the performance of the blades. This effect should be taken into account in blade design for small-to-medium size machines...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the trend}} of {{increasing}} power and reducing weight, the fan and compressor <b>bladings</b> of turbomachinery might {{be more sensitive to}} flutter, which must strictly be avoided already in the design process. In order to increase our understanding of the flutter phenomena for fan and compressor cascades, aeroelastic investigations are essential. This paper presents the achievements and results of experimental flutter investigations with a compressor cascade in the test facility of non-rotating annular cascades at EPFL. Flow conditions such as those that occur in rotating cascades are simulated by generating a spiral flow in the upstream. The construction of the cascade which takes into account the structural properties necessary to perform flutter experiments is described. For the simulation of elastic torsional vibrations of a two-dimensional blade section, the cascade consists of 20 blades (NACA 3506 profile) mounted on elastic spring suspensions which allows for torsional motion about the midchord. In order to investigate the influence of the reduced frequency on the global stability of the cascade and its local contributions, experiments were performed for two different reduced frequencies. At the higher reduced frequency the cascade remains aerodynamically stable, however, at the lower reduced frequency and transonic flow conditions, some of the interblade phase angles appear to be aerodynamically unstable...|$|E
40|$|The {{numerical}} {{design optimization}} for complex hydraulic machinery <b>bladings</b> requires {{a high number}} of design parameters and the use of a precise CFD solver yielding high computational costs. To reduce the CPU time needed, a multilevel CFD method has been developed. First of all, the 3 D blade geometry is parametrized by means of a geometric design tool {{to reduce the number of}} design parameters. To keep geometric accuracy, a special B-spline modification technique has been developed. On the first optimization level, a quasi- 3 D Euler code (EQ 3 D) is applied. To guarantee a sufficiently accurate result, the code is calibrated by a Navier-Stokes recalculation of the initial design and can be recalibrated after a number of optimization steps by another Navier-Stokes computation. After having got a convergent solution, the optimization process is repeated on the second level using a full 3 D Euler code yielding a more accurate flow prediction. Finally, a 3 D Navier-Stokes code is applied on the third level to search for the optimum optimorum by means of a fine-tuning of the geometrical parameters.

The obtained results show, for 2 D situation, that a maximum of 28. 3 % reduction in loss coefficient had been reached and the flow turning was increased with approximately 5 °.

40|$|Many modern {{axial flow}} {{compressor}} and fan rotors feature forward swept blades. However, there was no general consensus on advantages due to blade forward sweep until some years ago, {{also because of the}} difficulties in isolating the effect of blade sweep alone from the global aerodynamic blading behaviour. Thus, while some researchers try to collect in a “sweep package” all modifications connected to the introduction of blade sweep, there is no attempt in the recent literature to formalise a theory on the aerodynamic effect of sweep angle on axial flow fan blades. This paper first recalls the swept wing concept suggested by Adolf Busemann, then the original swept wing meaning is re- interpreted to present a simplified theory of blade forward sweep. This theory allows to explain the not yet completely understood changes in total pressure and efficiency due to the inclusion of sweep in the design of high circulation gradient controlled vortex design rotors. A methodology to select the degree of forward sweep to be chosen in the preliminary design of constant-swirl <b>bladings</b> for rotor-only axial flow fan featuring low hub-to-tip ratio is suggested as well. A specifically designed unswept fan and its modified configurations according to the suggested theory has been verified by using CFD.

40|$|The {{aeroelastic}} behaviour of {{vibrating blade}} assemblies is usually investigated {{in the frequency}} domain where the determination of aeroelastic stability boundaries is separated from the computation of linearized unsteady aerodynamic forces. However, nonlinear fluid-structure interaction caused by oscillating shocks or strong flow separation may significantly influence the aerodynamic damping and hence effect a shift of stability boundaries. In order to investigate such aeroelastic phenomena, the governing equations of structural and fluid motion have to be simultaneously integrated in time. In this paper a technique is presented which analyses the flutter behaviour of turbomachinery <b>bladings</b> in the time domain. The structural part of the governing aeroelastic equations is time-integrated according to the algorithm of Newmark, while the unsteady airloads are computed at every time step by a Navier-Stokes code. The link between the two time integrations is an automatic grid generation in which the used mesh is dynamically deformed so that it conforms with the deflected blades at every time step. The computed time series of the aeroelastic simulation of an assembly of highly loaded compressor blades vibrating freely in transonic flow are presented. The energy transfer between fluid and structure is here dominated by vibrating shocks and shock-boundary layer interaction. It is investigated if the predicted aeroelastic stability boundaries {{differ from those of}} a linearised method...|$|E
