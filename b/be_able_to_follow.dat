This requires {{the ability to}} maintain fairly accurate depth for the required periods, and to ascend at the correct rate. Some divers have the skills to do this independently of a static reference, referring only to depth and time instrument displays, others rely on a decompression buoy or shotline to monitor and help control changes of depth.|$|E
25|$|The {{collagen}} fibers {{are approximately}} 1-2 μm thick. Thus, {{the resolution of}} the imaging technique needs to be approximately 0.5 μm. Some techniques allow the direct acquisition of volume data while other need the slicing of the specimen. In both cases, the volume that is extracted must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the fiber bundles across the volume. High contrast makes segmentation easier, especially when color information is available. In addition, the need for fixation must also be addressed. It has been shown that soft tissue fixation in formalin causes shrinkage, altering the structure of the original tissue. Some typical values of contraction for different fixation are: formalin (5% - 10%), alcohol (10%), bouin (<5%).|$|E

25|$|The driverless tractor {{is part of}} a move to {{increase}} automation in farming. Other such autonomous technologies currently utilized in farming include automatic milking and automatic strawberry pickers. Developing such a technology is difficult. In order for it to be successful, the tractor must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> deterministic tasks (a task that is defined before it starts, such as a path to follow on a field), have reactive behavior (the ability to react to an unknown situation such as an obstacle in the way), and have reflexive responses (making a decision without hesitation or time consuming calculations such as changing the steering angle if necessary). Ultimately, the tractor should imitate a human in its ability to observe spatial position and make decisions such as speed.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{specific}} rights apply in criminal cases. Persons in custody {{have the right}} to consult a solicitor by virtue of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the Access to Justice Act 1999 allows an individual to request confidential and free legal advice. The prosecution is under a common law duty to disclose all relevant evidence including that which may assist the defendant. The accused also benefits from a limited right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination. Confessions are admissible as evidence under certain conditions laid down in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The accused additionally benefits from a presumption of innocence. In discharging the burden of proof, the onus is on the prosecution as established in Woolmington v DPP. For example, in R v Wang it was held that it was never permissible for a judge to direct a jury to find a defendant guilty. There is also a right to jury trial, the accused should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> proceedings and {{they have a right to}} be present during proceedings. The application of the double jeopardy rule was limited by the Criminal Justice Act 2003.|$|E

Since she was very young, she has always wanted to know more about the Earth and some day she hopes to surpass her mother in trying to bridge the gap between the Earth and the Kingdom of Sphere. She is well educated in terms of literature and science and has great sword skills. However, she is somewhat naive in matters of the heart and has a tendency to jump into situations without thinking, (such as jumping into a river to save a drowning puppy, without knowing how to swim, and mistaking moths for aliens). Feena once came to Earth when she was a child, and met Tatsuya previously after her mother's death, in which Tatsuya tried to comfort her. She eventually falls in love with him and later marries him to finally bring peace between the Earth and the Moon.|$|E

The episode had a season low rating of 1.8/5 among viewers 18–49, which was down 10% {{from the previous}} episode that aired on October 14. Between Fringe and its lead-in show Bones, Fox finished in third place for the night. The Fringe episode's low ratings have been attributed by critics to the unexpected end to the 2010 World Series, which caused Fringe to air a week earlier than expected. Den of Geek columnist Billy Grifter attributed the low ratings to the parallel universe focus, commenting [...] "if you weren't a fan beforehand, you'll not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> what's going on now. For those of us that did step onto the Fringe elevator early, it's a great ride, but I can see that it's a difficult proposition to attract new viewers."

[...] Each volume, starting with the strepsirrhines, covered its subjects exhaustively, including native and scientific nomenclature, anatomical structure, genetics, behaviour and palaeontology. The books were illustrated with both photographs and drawings, most of which were made by his wife, Yvonne. [...] The series was known for its breadth and depth, however it was never completed. [...] Projected as a nine-volume set, Osman Hill died in 1975, leaving his magnum opus unfinished. With five sections of the final volume written, including material on the taxonomy and most of the anatomy of langurs, it was hoped that his widow would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> through with plans to prepare and publish them.

Debra Leithauser and Amy Amatangelo of The Washington Post praised the pilot for relying [...] "on strong storytelling and casting", but hoped that viewers would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the multiple storylines. Barry Garron of The Hollywood Reporter said that the pilot was [...] "so cleverly constructed, the hero so engaging and complicated and the story so filled with great dialogue that I wonder how anyone can sustain this level of accomplishment." [...] He said that the protagonist [...] "has all the sass, strength, resolve and ingenuity of any of literature's classic detectives [...] and Bell is so convincing in the role that it all somehow makes perfect sense." [...] He praised the pilot and Thomas' writing, saying it had [...] "comedy, deathly serious drama, parody and danger, ingredients not typically mixed together", and said that [...] "if future episodes are half as good, this still will be one of TV's bright spots". Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times felt that Veronica Mars was the best new series on UPN, and that the title character was potentially [...] "this season's most interesting character creation".

Producers Mark Burg and Oren Koules, and writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan also returned. Brian Gedge replaced series' cinematographer David Armstrong. [...] Pre-production began on September 14, 2009. According to Melton, there were plans to title the film Saw: Endgame. Originally two sequels were planned after the sixth, but in December 2009 Melton stated in a podcast interview with the UK radio station Demon FM that Saw VII was the final installment and would address unanswered questions from previous Saw films, such as {{the fate of the}} first film's protagonist Dr. Lawrence Gordon and other Jigsaw survivors from previous films, while bringing a final resolution to the series. The storyline for a Saw VIII was combined into Saw VII; this decision was primarily due to Saw VI below average box office performance. [...] On July22, 2010 in an interview with USA Today the producers confirmed that Saw VII will officially end the film series. Burg told Reuters that, [...] "In every Saw movie, we left questions open and in Saw VII we answer every question the audience has ever had".

500|$|In September 2008 {{representatives from}} Hawkhurst, Goudhurst, Horsmonden and Paddock Wood Parish Councils met {{to discuss the}} {{possibility}} of converting {{all or part of}} the former line into a trail which could be used by cyclists and walkers. The proposal was supported by Kent County Council and a [...] section between Hawkhurst and Goudhurst has been identified as being easily convertible into a trail. The remainder to Paddock Wood is said to be [...] "more difficult but not impossible". Horsmonden Parish Council has declined to participate in the scheme on the basis that any trail would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the former railway alignment in its area due to private ownerships and in-filled sections. On 10 June 2011, Kent County Council organised a walk of the trackbed from Gills Green to demonstrate the work that would be needed to convert the trackbed for use by walkers and cyclists. The Kent and Sussex Courier reported that the project was keenly supported by all parish councils involved except for Horsmonden. The scheme was initially suggested by Hawkhurst Community Partnership. The proposed cycleway will be known as The Hop Pickers' Line should it be constructed. On 15 July 2011, it was reported that an application for a £1,000,000 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund was to be made in the coming week, with the result of the application being known in September 2011. In March 2013, it was reported that a decision from the Heritage Lottery Fund was still awaited.|$|E

500|$|According to Crowley, every {{individual}} has a True Will, to {{be distinguished from}} the ordinary wants and desires of the ego. The True Will is essentially one's [...] "calling" [...] or [...] "purpose" [...] in life. Some later magicians have taken this to include the goal of attaining self-realization by one's own efforts, {{without the aid of}} God or other divine authority. This brings them close to the position that Crowley held just prior to 1904. [...] Others follow later works such as Liber II, saying that one's own will in pure form is nothing other than the divine will. [...] Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law for Crowley refers not to hedonism, fulfilling everyday desires, but to acting in response to that calling. [...] The Thelemite is a mystic. [...] According to Lon Milo DuQuette, a Thelemite is anyone who bases their actions on striving to discover and accomplish their true will, when a person does their True Will, it is like an orbit, their niche in the universal order, and the universe assists them. [...] In order for the individual to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> their True Will, the everyday self's socially-instilled inhibitions may have to be overcome via deconditioning. [...] Crowley believed that in order to discover the True Will, one had to free the desires of the subconscious mind from the control of the conscious mind, especially the restrictions placed on sexual expression, which he associated with the power of divine creation. He identified the True Will of each individual with the Holy Guardian Angel, a daimon unique to each individual.

If the formation was attacked from the starboard, the starboard section engaged the attackers, the top section moving to starboard and the port section to the top position. If the attack came from the port side the system was reversed. British fighters coming from the rear were engaged by the rear section and the two outside sections similarly moving to the rear. If the threat came from above, the top section went into action while the side sections gained height to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> RAF fighters down as they broke away.
