40|$|ABSTRACT: Styrene radical {{polymerization}} {{was carried out}} {{in the presence of a}} polymerizable dithioester, benzyl 4 -vinyldithiobenzoate, which possesses a dithioester group and a polymerizable double <b>bond.</b> <b>Branched</b> polystyrene was formed during the polymerization, as indicated by multimodal GPC curves of the products. The branched polystyrene contains a dithiobenzoate C(dS) S moiety at each branch point and thus can be analyzed by cleavage with amine. After cleavage, the GPC profiles became narrow. The molecular weight of the cleaved product increased linearly with monomer conversion, illustrating a living fashion of the polymerization. Solution property obtained by simultaneous online measurements of viscosity and light scattering indicates that the viscosity of the branched product decreased remarkably as compared to the linear polystyrene of equivalent molecular weight. The copolymerization behavior of styrene and benzyl 4 -vinyldithiobenzoate was investigated by FT-IR monitoring during the polymerization. The results show that the latter was incorporated homogeneously into polystyrene chain. Therefore, branched polystyrene was synthesized with controlled architecture in the light of the length and narrow distribution of primary chains as well as the degree and the distribution of branching along the polymer chain...|$|R

40|$|Background Starch {{contributes}} to barley grain and malt quality {{which in turn}} {{contributes to}} beer quality and flavour; through fermentable sugar profiles, rates of fermentation and Mallard reactions. Both amylopectin and amylose are enzymatically degraded to release maltose, maltotriose and higher order sugars. Scope and approach Amylopectin is highly branched [α-(1  →  6) glycoside <b>bond</b> <b>branch</b> points] with numerous short branches while amylose is a long chained polymer with a few side branches. During grain development, the final level of branching is controlled by two enzymes namely; isoamylase and limit dextrinase (LD). Mutations in either of these genes can also result in changes to structure, content, and granule formation and size. During the malting free LD will to cleave the α-(1  →  6) bonds but during mashing processes, bound LD is release, resulting in chains of various length available for other starch degrading enzymes to hydrolyse. Findings and conclusions While {{there is a good}} understanding of most of the individual aspects in amylopectin formation, structure and degradation; the story remains incomplete, as most of this understanding has been gained from experiments with {{only a limited number of}} barley varieties, limitations in the technology for structural measurement, and since no data is available to link structure to fermentable sugar profiles...|$|R
40|$|We study {{critical}} bond percolation on a seven-dimensional (7 D) hypercubic lattice with periodic {{boundary conditions}} {{and on the}} complete graph (CG) of finite volume V. We numerically confirm that for both cases, the critical number density n(s,V) of clusters of size s obeys a scaling form n(s,V) ∼ s^-τñ (s/V^d^*_ f) with identical volume fractal dimension d^*_ f= 2 / 3 and exponent τ = 1 + 1 /d^*_ f= 5 / 2. We then classify occupied bonds into bridge <b>bonds,</b> which includes <b>branch</b> and junction <b>bonds,</b> and non-bridge bonds; a bridge <b>bond</b> is a <b>branch</b> <b>bond</b> {{if and only if}} its deletion produces at least one tree. Deleting <b>branch</b> <b>bonds</b> from percolation configurations produces leaf-free configurations, whereas, deleting all bridge bonds leads to bridge-free configurations. It is shown that the fraction of non-bridge (bi-connected) bonds vanishes ρ_ n, CG→ 0 for large CGs, but converges to a finite value ρ_ n, 7 D = 0. 006 193 1 (7) for the 7 D hypercube. Further, we observe that while the bridge-free dimension d^*_ bf= 1 / 3 holds for both the CG and 7 D cases, the volume fractal dimensions of the leaf-free clusters are different: d^*_ℓ f, 7 D = 0. 669 (9) ≈ 2 / 3 and d^*_ℓ f, CG = 0. 333 7 (17) ≈ 1 / 3. We also study the behavior of the number and the size distribution of leaf-free and bridge-free clusters. For the number of clusters, we numerically find the number of leaf-free and bridge-free clusters on the CG scale as ∼ V, while for 7 D they scale as ∼ V. Our work demonstrates that the geometric structure of high-dimensional percolation clusters cannot be fully accounted for by their complete-graph counterparts.

30|$|In {{this study}} the waste {{polyethylene}} were degraded by thermal hydropyrolytic process. The degradation process mainly follows {{the mechanism of}} chain scissions which is generally caused by increase in temperature and sheer stress in twin-skew extruders and hence decreases the molecular weight. Cross linking or chain branching have opposite effect to chain scission and are caused mainly by low sheer stress and high residence time in a single skew extruders. A concurrence occurs between the molecular enlargement by chain branching and the decrease of molecular weight by chain scission. The thermal degradation of the polymers occurs by breaking C–C or C–H bonds. Degradation depends on the nature such as polar groups and structure, for example head-to-head or tail-to-tail weak linkages, double <b>bonds</b> or <b>branching</b> points of the polymeric chain, on the ingredients in the polymer resin and {{on the type of}} the external stress.|$|R

Transesterification of acylcarnitines was performed by reaction with 3 -pyridylcarbinol and potassium tert-butoxide in dichloromethane to produce acyl picolinyl esters. The picolinyl esters were separated and detected by gas chromatography/electron ionization-mass spectrometry.
