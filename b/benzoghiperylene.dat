50|$|<b>Benzoghiperylene</b> is a {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbon}} with the chemical formula C22H12.|$|E
50|$|In February 2014, NASA {{announced}} a greatly upgraded database for tracking {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs), including <b>benzoghiperylene,</b> in the universe. According to scientists, more than 20% of the carbon in the universe {{may be associated with}} PAHs, possible starting materials for the formation of life. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the Big Bang, are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets.|$|E
30|$|PAHs mix {{solution}} (1 - 1) [Acenaphthene, Acenaphthylene, Anthracene, Benzo(b)fluoranthene, 1, 2 -Benz anthracene, Benzo(a)pyrene, Benzo(k)fluoranthene, <b>Benzo(g,h,i)perylene,</b> Chrysene, Dibenz(a,h)anthracene, Fluoranthene, Fluorene, Indeno(1, 2, 3 -cd)pyrene, Phenanthrene, Naphthalene, Pyrene] {{were purchased}} from AccuStandard. PAHs stock solution was 0.2  mg/ml in dichloromethane and methanol. Phenol was purchased from Merck, Germany. Phenol stock solution was 10  mg/ml in deionized water. Sodium sulfate was purchased from Merck, Germany. Sodium sulfate stock solution was 10  mg/ml dissolved in deionized water. All other solvents and chemicals used were of reagent grade. Mineral Salt Medium (MSM) contained (g/l), g/l were KH 2 PO 4 (0.42), K 2 HPO 4 (0.375), (NH 4) 2 SO 4 (0.244), NaCl (0.015), CaCl 2 · 2 H 2 O (0.015), MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O (0.05), and FeCl 3 · 6 H 2 O (0.054).|$|E
30|$|Ratios of {{selected}} PAH components {{have been widely}} used to identify specific sources and although results may be ambiguous, they provide indicative values (Countway et al. 2003; Feng et al. 2014; Pedersen et al. 2015 a; Soclo et al. 2000; Yunker et al. 2002). In cases of PAH pollution from several sources, the ratios may be used for evaluating predominant sources. The ratio of anthracene/(anthracene and phenanthrene) has previously been used for determining petrogenic (< 0.1) and pyrogenic (> 0.1) sources (Soclo et al. 2000). In this study the ratio was 0.1 and hence in the borderline of petrogenic and pyrogenic sources. The PAH ratios fluoranthene/(fluoranthene and pyrene) and indeno(123 -cd)pyrene/(indeno(1, 2, 3 -cd)pyrene and <b>benzo(ghi)perylene)</b> have been used to indicate whether pyrogenic sources originate from liquid fossil fuel combustion (0.4 – 0.5 / 0.2 – 0.5) or coal/biomass combustion (> 0.5 /> 0.5) (Feng et al. 2014). In this study these ratios were 0.1 and 0.3, respectively, indicating that the source to be combustion of liquid fossil fuel. It is hence highly likely that the PAH pollution found at the site is related to the oil pollution at the site.|$|E
