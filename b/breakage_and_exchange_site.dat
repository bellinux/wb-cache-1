40|$|A leucine-requiring {{hybrid of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, homoallelic at the LEU 1 locus (leu 1 - 12 /leu 1 - 12) and {{heterozygous}} for three chromosome-VII genetic markers distal to the LEU 1 locus, {{was employed to}} inquire: (1) whether spontaneous gene mutation and mitotic segregation of heterozygous markers occur in positive nonrandom association and (2) whether homozygous LEU 1 /LEU 1 mutant diploids are generated. The results demonstrate that gene mutation of leu 1 - 12 to LEU 1 and mitotic segregation of heterozygous chromosome-VII markers occur in strong positive nonrandom association, suggesting that the stimulatory DNA lesion is both mutagenic and recombinogenic. In addition, genetic analysis of diploid Leu+ revertants revealed that approximately 3 % of mutations of leu 1 - 12 to LEU 1 result in LEU 1 /LEU 1 homozygotes. Red-white sectored Leu+ colonies exhibit genotypes that implicate post-replicational chromatid <b>breakage</b> <b>and</b> <b>exchange</b> near the <b>site</b> of leu 1 - 12 reversion, chromosome loss, and subsequent restitution of diploidy, in {{the sequence of events}} leading to mutational homozygosis.

5000|$|The {{purpose for}} {{in vivo testing}} is to {{determine}} the potential of DNA damage that can affect chromosomal structure or disturb the mitotic apparatus that changes chromosome number; the factors that could influence the genotoxicity are ADME and DNA repair. It can also detect genotoxic agents missed in in vitro tests. The positive result of induced chromosomal damage is an increase in frequency of micronucelated PCEs. [...] A micronucleus is a small structure separate from the nucleus containing nuclear DNA arisen from DNA fragments or whole chromosomes that were not incorporated in the daughter cell during mitosis. Causes for this structure are mitotic loss of acentric chromosomal fragments (clastogenicity), mechanical problems from chromosomal <b>breakage</b> <b>and</b> <b>exchange,</b> mitotic loss of chromosomes (aneugenicity), and apoptosis. The micronucleus test in vivo is similar to the in vitro one because it tests for structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells, especially in rats' blood cells.|$|R
40|$|Summary. The {{distribution}} of the points of <b>breakage</b> <b>and</b> reunion {{of a series of}} 58 Robertsonian translocations, 53 reciprocal translocations, and 10 inversions is described. An excess of 13 / 14 and 14 / 21 rearrangements was found among the Robertsonian translocations, this excess being independent of the method of ascer-tainment of the proband. The {{distribution of}} break points between chromosome arms in the reciprocal translocations, with the possible exception ofthe long arms of chromosome 11, was no different from that expected {{on the basis of their}} relative lengths. However, within arms there appeared to be an excess of breaks in the terminal regions, an excess of terminal/centromeric translocations where ascertain-ment was through a balanced carrier and a possible excess ofterminal/median trans-locations where ascertainment was through an unbalanced carrier. Nine inversions were analysed and three ofthese involved identical break points on chromosome 8. Possible reasons for the apparent non-randomness of points of <b>breakage</b> <b>and</b> ex-change are discussed and it is concluded that the techniques ofpreparation, methods of observations, and methods of ascertainment all affect the distribution of observed points of <b>breakage</b> <b>and</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>and</b> must therefore be taken into cognizance in any study of chromosome rearrangements in man. The recently developed techniques for banding chromosomes have enabled every chromosome in man to be unequivocably identified and, further-more, because the banding pattern of any particular segment of a chromosome arm retains its charac-teristic morphology when transferred to another part of the complement, structural rearrangements within and between chromosomes can be identified with considerable accuracy. Not only can the chromosome arm involved in the rearrangement be determined but, in many cases, the position of the breakpoints can be localized to a single band. These developments have resulted in two ad-vances in the study of structural abnormalities of the chromosomes. Firstly, they have enabled structural abnormalities previously recognized by simple staining techniques to be accurately classified...|$|R

40|$|Streptomyces phage wBT 1 {{integrates}} its genome {{into the}} attB {{site of the}} host chromosome with the attP site to generate attL and attR. The wBT 1 integrase belongs to the large serine recombinase subfamily which directly binds to target sites to initiate double strand <b>breakage</b> <b>and</b> <b>exchange.</b> A recombination directionality factor (RDF) is commonly required for switching integration to excision. Here we report the characterization of the RDF protein for wBT 1 recombination. The RDF, is a phage-encoded gp 3 gene product (28 KDa), which allows efficient active excision between attL and attR, and inhibits integration between attB and attP; Gp 3 can also catalyze topological relaxation with the integrase of supercoiled plasmids containing a single excision site. Further study showed that Gp 3 could form a dimer and interact with the integrase whether it bound to the substrate or not. The synapse formation of attL or attR alone with integrase and Gp 3 showed that synapsis did not discriminate between the two sites, indicating that complementarity of central dinucleotides is the sole determinant of outcome in correct excision synapses. Furthermore, both in vitro and in vivo evidence support that the RDFs of wBT 1 an...|$|R
40|$|Thymidine-H 3 of high {{specific}} activity {{was used to}} study the distribution of labeled chromatids during meiotic divisions in spermatocytes of a species of grasshopper (Orthoptera). The distribution is regularly semiconservative {{as has been shown}} previously for mitosis, i. e., all chromatids are labeled after incorporation of thymidine-H 3 into DNA at premeiotic interphase. If incorporation occurs at the interphase preceding this one, the chromosomes arrive at meiotic divisions with the equivalent of one chromatid of each homologue labeled. Chromatid exchanges occur at a frequency which is very nearly that predicted on the assumption that each chiasma represents an exchange between homologous chromatids. However, the exchanges are randomly distributed among chromosomes in a size group, whereas chiasmata are not. A quantitative analysis of the frequency <b>and</b> pattern of <b>exchanges</b> indicates that most of these result from <b>breakage</b> <b>and</b> reciprocal <b>exchange</b> between homologous chromatids.

The first one developed by Northrop and Clayton (1966) is designed for isotope exchanges between two <b>exchange</b> <b>sites</b> (hereafter, the N&C method), the second one from Zheng et al.

In this paper, we use a simple model of isotope kinetic exchange for a 3 -exchange site system (such as hydroxysilicates where oxygen occurs as OH and non-OH groups like in muscovite, chlorite, serpentine, or water or calcite) to explore the behavior of the N&C and Z methods. We show that these two methods lead to significant biases that cannot be detected with the usual graphical tests proposed by the authors. Our model shows that biases originate because isotopes are fractionated between all these <b>exchanging</b> <b>sites.</b> Actually, we point out that the variable mobility (or exchangeability) of isotopes in <b>and</b> between the <b>exchange</b> <b>sites</b> only controls the amplitude of the bias, but is not essential to the production of this bias as previously suggested. Setting a priori two of the three <b>exchange</b> <b>sites</b> at isotopic equilibrium remove the bias and thus is required for future partial exchange experiments to produce accurate and unbiased extrapolated equilibrium fractionation factors. Our modeling applied to published partial oxygen isotope exchange experiments for 3 -exchange site systems (the muscovite-calcite (Chacko et al., 1996), the chlorite-water (Cole and Ripley, 1998) and the serpentine–water (Saccocia et al., 2009)) shows that the extrapolated equilibrium fractionation factors (reported as 1000 ln(α)) using either the N&C or the Z methods lead to bias that may reach several δ per mil in a few cases. These problematic cases, may be because experiments were conducted at low temperature and did not reach high exchange percentages (< 50 %) such as the chlorite–water and the serpentine–water experiments...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{initiated}} to evaluate potential source(s) of elevated uranium in ground and surface {{waters of the}} Treasure Valley in southwest Idaho. Groundwater in the area exhibits widespread but complexly distributed uranium concentrations up to 110 mg L- 1, well {{in excess of the}} U. S. EPA drinking water standard of 30 mg L- 1. Data from field sampling (surface water, groundwater, and solid sediments), laboratory experiments, and geochemical and isotopic analysis constrain the source of the elevated uranium. Results from surface water sampling show significant downstream increases in uranium concentrations. With irrigation return waters and shallow groundwater returns indicated as the primary contributors toward elevated uranium concentrations, evidence suggests that a near-surface uranium source exists within the valley. When evaluated for isotopic composition, these surface waters consistently evolved toward a common nexus of 234 U/ 238 U and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic composition that is also shared by the estimated mean groundwater composition and several of the most elevated groundwater samples. Analysis {{of a wide variety of}} geologic materials representing aquifer sediments did not uncover materials containing particularly high bulk uranium contents (avg. of 3. 5 ppm). Furthermore, isotopic analysis of nearly all the solids produced low 234 U/ 238 U ratios that are incompatible with the source material. In addition, isotopic results definitively indicate that the analyzed fertilizers cannot be the source of the uranium. Only two shallow geologic samples collected from terrace and floodplain sediment yielded high enough 234 U/ 238 U ratios to match the projected source signature. Isotopic and elemental differences between three selective leaching treatments applied to each solid show that, on average, the most uranium and highest 234 U/ 238 U ratios were associated with the carbonate extraction. The two high 234 U/ 238 U solids did not contain particularly high carbonate contents, and it appears that the carbonate leaching solution acts to assist in releasing the source uranium from sorption <b>and</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>sites</b> in some shallow, fine-grained, clastic sediments of the Gowen Terrace and modern floodplain formations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{detailed}} geochemical {{study of}} surface waters, spring waters, and groundwaters was undertaken {{to examine the}} geochemical evolution of groundwater on Saturna Island, British Columbia. The {{purpose of the study}} was to characterize the nature and occurrence of saline waters and to provide insight on chemical processes that lead to salinization in the fractured sedimentary bedrock aquifers of this small island. Major ion chemistry shows that groundwater is re-charged locally but mixes with saline waters that occur at depth or near the coast. Simple mixing is complicated by cation exchange (between calcium-rich waters <b>and</b> sodium-rich <b>exchange</b> <b>sites</b> offered by mudstone beds) and results in a spatially variable hydrochemical composition that is dependent on the island topography and geological framework (structural, sedimentological, and glacial), in combination with groundwater use patterns. Sodium, present at <b>exchange</b> <b>sites,</b> is speculated to be a remnant of ocean water intrusion during the Pleistocene, when the island was submerged. As a result of its high mobility and conservative nature, chloride (and sulphate) has been flushed from the shallow bed-rock during a process of natural desalinization but may remain trapped in the pores and fractures at depth. Modern salt-water intrusion, brought about by increased development on the island, is now competing with natural desaliniza-tion along the coast and has left many drinking-water supplies contaminated.

These data are necessary to fully understand migration and remediation of 90 Sr, 129 I, 137 Cs, and 60 Co. Fourteen P-wells were selected and sampled based on their close proximity to facilities, available water table and Gordon aquifer wells, and archived core. This report provides the analytical results from the groundwater sampling and core leaching studies. Several radioactive contaminants have naturally occurring counterparts that are non-radioactive, but have chemical behavior that is identical to the radioactive contaminants. These naturally occurring isotopes are typically present in groundwater at mass concentrations that are orders of magnitude greater than their associated radionuclides. A consequence of this is that the natural constituents compete for adsorption <b>and</b> cation <b>exchange</b> <b>site</b> s with their radioactive counterparts, reducing retardation of the radioactive species. Hence, the concentrations of these natural species are important to the modeling of monitored natural attenuation, performance assessments, and other regulatory documents that require a fate and transport analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{domination}} of Etruria by Rome is {{an aspect of}} Roman colonization which is generally well understood. Etruria, which began as a significantly more powerful entity than Rome, was brought to heel through the establishment of bilateral treaties and Roman colonies. This study seeks an even further nuanced model for {{the nature of the}} conquest of Etruria-namely looking at the underlying mechanisms that made the treaties and colonies successful. Social network analysis is particularly well suited for this task as it visualizes interaction <b>and</b> <b>exchange</b> between <b>sites</b> which often times dictates a sites success or failure. When enlarged to the regional scale SNA can be used to understand how a region prospers or declines based on site interactions. For my study I used SNA to discuss how Roman conquest affected Etruscan exchange networks-especially economic exchange networks-and how this network transformation was used to control the region of Etruria. The results show that Rome all but replaced the previous Etruscan network with their own Imperial network that seems, based on preliminary research, centered on strategically selected administration centers in Etruria-utilizing both native Etruscan sites and newly inaugurated Roman colonies...|$|R
50|$|The Portuguese {{position}} on the Gold Coast remained secure for over a century. During that time, Lisbon sought to monopolize all trade in the region in royal hands, though appointed officials at São Jorge, and used force to prevent English, French, and Flemish efforts to trade on the coast. By 1598, the Dutch began trading on the Gold Coast. The Dutch built forts at Komenda and Kormantsi by 1612. In 1637 they captured Elmina Castle from the Portuguese and Axim in 1642 (Fort St Anthony). Other European traders joined in by the mid-17th century, largely English, Danes, and Swedes. The coastline was dotted by more than 30 forts and castles built by Dutch, British, and Danish merchants primarily to protect their interests from other Europeans and pirates. The Gold Coast became the highest concentration of European military architecture outside of Europe. Sometimes they were also drawn into conflicts with local inhabitants as Europeans developed commercial alliances with local political authorities. These alliances, often complicated, involved both Europeans attempting to enlist or persuade their closest allies to attack rival European ports and their African allies, or conversely, various African powers seeking to recruit Europeans as mercenaries in their inter-state wars, or as diplomats to resolve conflicts.Forts were built, abandoned, attacked, captured, sold, <b>and</b> <b>exchanged,</b> <b>and</b> many <b>sites</b> were selected {{at one time or}} another for fortified positions by contending European nations.|$|R
