When {{mixed with a}} small amount of water a semi-solid crystalline mass of the pentahydrate, SnCl4·5H2O is formed. This solid was formerly known as <b>butter</b> <b>of</b> <b>tin.</b> With hydrochloric acid the complex SnCl62− is formed making the so-called hexachlorostannic acid.|$|E

Shackleton's hut was found intact, with bread still on the tables just as it had been left.

Fruit processing, manufactory of compotes, manufactory of metal packaging products, corrosion of cans, chemical behaviour <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> in food, its potential toxicity, {{possibilities for the}} determination <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> in food and characterization of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry are described in theoretical part. In experimental part, ICP-OES technique was firstly optimized and then 28 different compotes purchased at common stores were analysed. The concentration <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> was determined only in fruit juice due to the easier sample preparation, even though quantity <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> in the solid part and in the juice can differ. However, the difference is not too big. Measured concentrations <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> were compared with the maximum permissible level <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> in canned food determined by European legislation. None of them exceed the 200 mg/kg level. When processing the results, {{it was found that}} the coating of the can has a significant influence on the content <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> in canned fruits. Concentrations <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> in laquered cans were significantly lower than in unlaquered cans...|$|R

The best procedure for the determination <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> in the ET-AAS was applied to samples of soil, sediment and water. As the optimum matrix modifier was chosen the solution of Pd (NO 3) 2 in 5 % ascorbic acid, the optimum pyrolysis temperature was 1400 °C and atomization temperature 2400 ° C.

5000|$|Though {{the recipe}} <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> glazes may differ in {{different}} sites and periods, {{the process of}} the production <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> glazes is similar. Generally speaking, the first step of the production <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> glazes is to mix tin and lead in order to form oxides, which was then added to a glaze matrix (alkali-silicate glaze, for example) and heated. After the mixture cooled, the tin oxide crystallises as what has been mentioned above, therefore generates the so-called white tin-opacified glazes. Besides, the body of tin-opacified wares is generally calcareous clays containing 15-25% CaO, of which the thermal expansion coefficient is close to that <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> glazes, thus avoid crazing during the firing process. On the other hand, the calcareous clay fired in an oxidising atmosphere results in a buff colour, thus lower the concentration <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> oxide used ...|$|R
50|$|Biscuit tins are steel cans made <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> plate. This {{consists}} of steel sheets thinly coated with tin. The sheets are then bent to shape.

Biscuit tin manufacture was a small but prestigious part of the vast industry <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> plate production, which saw a huge increase in demand in the 19th century was directly related to the growing industrialisation of food production, by increasingly sophisticated methods of preservation and the requirements made by changing methods of distribution.|$|R
5000|$|By 1870, {{production}} {{had increased}} {{enough for the}} mine to have 200 men working there. Not long before its closure in 1877, a new lode <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> had been discovered.

5000|$|There is {{no record}} <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> mining in Domesday Book, {{possibly}} because the rights were Crown property.

The Pipe Roll of Henry II gives the annual <b>tin</b> production <b>of</b> Dartmoor to be about 60 tons.
