Further, despite claims that Chauvel alone had {{a clear view of}} the <b>battle,</b> <b>that</b> his coolness and skill were crucial in gaining the victory, his name was omitted from the long list of honours published on New Year's Day 1917. Murray did offer Chauvel a lesser award (a Distinguished Service Order) for Romani which he declined.|$|E

5|$|Following Khumarawayh's {{ascension}} {{to power}} in 884, the Abbasid central government decided to reassert its control over the provinces ruled by him and invaded northern Syria that year. By early 885 the conflict was proceeding favorably for the Abbasids, forcing Khumarawayh to personally take the field and try to stop their advance toward Egypt. In the <b>battle</b> <b>that</b> followed, the Abbasid troops initially defeated the Tulunids and plundered Khumarawayh's camp, but were then ambushed by a Tulunid reserve force and routed in turn.|$|E

In addition to those listed, during 1942–1943, the 14th, 21st, 25th and 30th Brigades were also attached, albeit temporarily for varying periods.|$|E

5|$|A legal <b>battle</b> <b>that</b> {{began the}} same year {{interfered}} with the band's working on another release. Volcano Entertainment—the successor of Tool's by-then defunct label Zoo Entertainment—alleged contract violations by Tool and filed a lawsuit. According to Volcano, Tool had violated their contract when the band looked at offers from other record labels. After Tool filed a countersuit stating that Volcano had failed to use a renewal option in their contract, the parties settled out of court. In December 1998 Tool agreed to a new contract, a three-record joint venture deal. In 2000, the band dismissed their long-time manager Ted Gardner, who then sued the band over his commission on this lucrative agreement.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Rodney was escorting a {{fleet of}} supply ships to relieve the Spanish siege of Gibraltar with {{a fleet of}} about twenty ships of the line when he {{encountered}} Lángara's squadron south of Cape St. Vincent. When Lángara saw {{the size of the}} British fleet, he attempted to make for the safety of Cádiz, but the copper-sheathed British ships chased his fleet down. In a running <b>battle</b> <b>that</b> lasted from mid-afternoon until after midnight, the British captured four Spanish ships, including Lángara's flagship. Two other ships were also captured, but their final disposition is unclear; some Spanish sources indicate they were retaken by their Spanish crews, while Rodney's report indicates the ships were grounded and destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Adomnán in his Life of Saint Columba {{offers a}} longer account, which Abbot Ségéne {{had heard from}} Oswald himself. Oswald, he says, {{had a vision of}} Columba the night before the battle, in which he was toldBe strong and act manfully. Behold, I will be with thee. This coming night go out from your camp into battle, for the Lord has granted me that at this time your foes shall be put to flight and Cadwallon your enemy shall be {{delivered}} into your hands and you shall return victorious after battle and reign happily. Oswald described his vision to his council and all agreed that they would be baptised and accept Christianity after the battle. In the <b>battle</b> <b>that</b> followed, the British were routed despite their superior numbers; Cadwallon himself was killed.|$|E
5|$|American Philo McGiffin, who was {{on board}} Zhenyuan, {{reported}} after the <b>battle</b> <b>that</b> {{there had been a}} variety of stories about the fate of the ship, but one that the survivors agreed on was the tale of the interaction between Captain Deng and his dog. As the ship went down, the captain ended up clinging to a piece of debris. However, his dog swam to him. Deng released the debris, and unable to swim, he drowned along with the dog. Chinese sources have subsequently stated Captain Deng made the decision to go down with Zhiyuan. In this retelling, the dog attempted to drag him to safety, but he refused to be moved and both died.|$|E
5|$|Attempting {{to escape}} {{under cover of}} {{darkness}} on 14 April, the French squadron was spotted by a number of small British ships stationed close inshore. These ships raised the alarm and the main British squadron followed in pursuit. The rearmost French ship of the line, Hautpoult, was closely followed by the small brig HMS Recruit, which succeeded in delaying Hautpoult long enough that the main British squadron was able to attack and overwhelm her in a running <b>battle</b> <b>that</b> lasted three days and ended off the coast of Puerto Rico. The British suffered 45 casualties, the French nearly 100. The remainder of the French squadron escaped, with the two surviving ships of the line sailing directly for France, eventually reaching Cherbourg in May.|$|E
