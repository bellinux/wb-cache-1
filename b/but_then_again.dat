25|$|Despite this, Bournonville {{decided to}} compose {{his own version}} of the story about the young man who is danced into a spell by a group of elf maidens. In an {{engraving}} from 1856, the painter Edvard Lehmann, who was also a close friend of the Bournonville family, portrayed the spellbound Junker Ove encircled by the hovering, luminous elves. Ove is briefly imprisoned in this state, but fortunately the beautiful Hilda comes to his rescue with water from a healing spring. Even though she has grown up among trolls inside the hill, we know that she is really a changeling, swapped as a baby with the temperamental Birthe, who is the real troll child. The changeling aspect means that the story never becomes as seriously dangerous for Ove as the Sylphide's enchantment is for James in Bournonville's Taglioni-inspired ballet from 1836. <b>But</b> <b>then,</b> <b>again,</b> the Danish Romantics did not cultivate fragmentation {{in the same way as}} the French.

25|$|Herath and Sangakkara added 35 in nine overs on {{the fourth}} morning, as Sri Lanka {{declared}} on 375 for 7. Set 378 to win, West Indies were left to face the variations of Muralitharan – who bowled doosras and normal off-spin mixed up together as the West Indian batsmen were comprehensively deceived. Four catches went to the hands of Jayawardene who fielded at silly point – not normally the position where most catches are taken, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>again,</b> this wasn't a usual innings. The West Indians were shown up for what they were – run-of-the-mill domestic players who should never have played international cricket, bar possibly Chanderpaul who made 24, Deonarine who even had the cheek to smash Muralitharan for six before being deceived, bowled for 29, and Denesh Ramdin who scampered together 28. Muralitharan registered his fourteenth ten-wicket-haul in a match, {{it was the fourth}} time he had taken more than eight wickets, and Sri Lanka cruised to another 240-run victory – although, in all fairness, it was a difficult pitch to bat on, and the tourists had shown some promise with the bat. It showed that the West Indies desperately needed to sort out their contract problems before the next home season, however – their next away series being against Australia, which even a full-strength West Indies would struggle with.|$|E

In a 1982 interview, Harrison described his statement on God rewarding those who first look to God as a [...] "flexible" [...] one, adding: [...] "In one way, I'm {{never going to get}} out of here [...] unless it's by His grace, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>again</b> … he amount of grace I would expect from God should be equal to the amount of grace I can gather or earn." ...|$|E

It isn't perfect, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>again,</b> it doesn't need to be." [...] At the website Metacritic, which uses a normalized rating system, the film earned a mixed rating of 58% based on 31reviews by mainstream critics.

I didn't consider myself co-producer. Van would ask me questions and I would give him answers, but it was never a defined role."

[...] When asked if her accent [...] "sounded realistic", he noted, [...] "I'm {{going to go with}} that. I know people who sound like that." [...] In response to the accent, Moore explained [...] "I went to school in Boston and worked with a lot of guys from Dorchester, so that's where [...] came from.

He chases Deckard through the building, ending on the roof. Deckard tries to jump to an adjacent roof, but is left hanging between buildings. Roy makes the jump with ease, and as Deckard's grip loosens, Roy hoists him onto the roof, saving him. Before Roy dies, he delivers a monologue about how his memories [...] "will be lost in time, like tears in rain". Gaff arrives and shouts to Deckard about Rachael: [...] "It's too bad she won't live, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>again,</b> who does?"

The Canadian Press reported that [...] "A number of celebrities' stars are looking a bit rough around the edges." [...] The president of the Walk of Fame stated that damage {{was due to the}} freezing and thawing during Canadian winters and also sidewalk snowplows. It was announced that the city of Toronto would replace Shatner and Howe's damaged tiles, and the Walk of Fame was looking into an alternative to installing the plaques on a sidewalk where they are subjected to harsh environmental conditions.|$|E

500|$|The {{third and}} fourth singles from One More Day were less successful: [...] "Sweet Summer" [...] made Top 20, while [...] "That's Just That" [...] failed to make Top 40. The album {{featured}} a guest vocal from Chely Wright on [...] "I'm Trying", making for the band's first ever duet with another artist {{on one of their}} own albums. It also included a cover of [...] "Hearts Against the Wind", originally recorded by J. D. Souther and Linda Ronstadt for the Urban Cowboy soundtrack. Chris Neal of Country Weekly thought that the album showed a greater musical variety than its predecessors, specifically noting the [...] "spoken-word verses" [...] of [...] "Here I Go Fallin'", the [...] "Hearts Against the Wind" [...] cover, and the Wright duet as standout tracks. Rick Cohoon of Allmusic cited the album's singles and the Wright duet as the album's best tracks, adding that [...] "If any flaw can be found here it would be the band's choice not to experiment with new sound, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>again,</b> why tamper with a good thing?" ...|$|E

The band {{considered}} [...] "Fez– Being Born" [...] and [...] "Get on your Boots" [...] as album openers, but ultimately decided on [...] "No Line on the Horizon". At {{the end of the}} sessions, the band chose to include [...] "White as Snow", a quiet song about a dying soldier in Afghanistan, to balance out the earlier, rockier tunes. With the exception of this track, U2 had tried to keep the theme of war out of the album. In early December 2008, Clayton stated, [...] "this is definitely the last week of recording. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>again,</b> last week was definitely the last week of recording, and the week before that." [...] The final sessions ended later that month. No Line on the Horizon is dedicated to Rob Partridge, who signed the band's first record deal in 1980 and died of cancer in late 2008.|$|E
500|$|... "Whiplash" [...] has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Tim Sendra of Allmusic selected {{it as one}} of the 'track picks' of When the Sun Goes Down, calling it a [...] "stomping jam" [...] and one of the surprises of the album. He stated that the song [...] "adds some welcome weirdness to an otherwise straightforward record." [...] In a positive review, Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post suggested that [...] "Whiplash" [...] was better than at least five songs from Spears's seventh studio album Femme Fatale (2011), saying [...] "what I can't figure out is {{why in the world would}} [...] give up this hot track". Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly commented that [...] "the top-shelf collaborators don't hurt — see: the grinding 'Whiplash,' co-penned by one Britney Spears." [...] Scott Shetler of PopCrush gave the song four stars out of five, explaining that it [...] "possesses a hook that will send people running for the dance floor", although [...] "Gomez's vocal is pretty flat [...] <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>again,</b> this isn't the kind of song to show off any sort of vocal gymnastics." ...|$|E

500|$|Stylistically, One Hot Minute diverged {{from the}} Chili Peppers' {{previous}} records—especially Blood Sugar Sex Magik. The album {{was characterized by}} prominent use of heavy metal guitar riffs and hints of psychedelic rock. Navarro, unlike Flea and Kiedis, was not influenced by funk music. He told Guitar World in 1996, [...] "It doesn't really speak to me. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>again,</b> when I'm playing with three other guys who I love and feel camaraderie with, it's enjoyable to play funk." [...] Navarro's own style was influenced mainly by classic rock guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page, as well as gothic rock guitarists Robert Smith and Daniel Ash. Continuing a trend that started on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Kiedis diverged even further away from his signature rapping, only doing so on a few tracks. One Hot Minute took almost two years to write, and its recording and production was not a smooth process. Navarro {{felt as though he}} was an outsider to the other members. His writing in Jane's Addiction was independent from other contributors, whereas the Red Hot Chili Peppers was a far more collaborative group. Navarro himself noted that the band's dynamic was more balanced than that of Jane's Addiction, which was often dominated by frontman Perry Farrell.|$|E

[...] Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict said [...] "When Flanders Failed" [...] shows that even if The Simpsons is not dealing with famous celebrities or [...] "high profile places", the writers can still [...] "wring uproarious comedy out of their cast of regulars. Flanders is a special creation in the canon of humor, a regular guy who is funny because of how hyper-normal he is compared to his Neanderthal neighbors. The focus on people who are left-handed, and the whole idea of being a lefty, is an unusual basis for a television show. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>again,</b> nothing about The Simpsons is ever common." [...] Hock Guan Teh of DVD Town also praised the writers, stating that they [...] "are able to craft a downtrodden tale for the perpetually clueless Flanders family that serves to illustrate how dark emotions can eventually be overcome by Homer's guilt. A memorable episode." [...] Niel Harvey of The Roanoke Times called [...] "When Flanders Failed" [...] a [...] "classic bit of Simpsonia." [...] The episode's reference to It's a Wonderful Life [...] was named the 26th greatest film reference in the history of the show by Total Films Nathan Ditum.|$|E

[...] In late November, {{columnist}} David Bushnell wrote an article, [...] "Are Giants missing the boat on Gordon Bell?," [...] questioning the team's lack of utilization of Bell. [...] Bushnell noted that Bell had [...] "spent {{most of the season}} standing on the sideline waiting to be inserted into the lineup for a few plays." [...] The Giants' starting running back in 1976 was Doug Kotar, though Bushnell opined that Bell was the superior back: [...] "Bell is quick, with speed to break any play for a long gain, and he can catch the ball[...] [...] [...] If the Giants are trying to break Bell in gradually, they might just miss the boat totally, breaking Bell instead." [...] Bell noted {{at the time that the}} lack of playing time held him back: [...] "It takes me about a quarter or so to get going, break a sweat and get the legs loosened up. [...] I really don't like being shuffled in and out so much, but as a rookie I can't do much about it." [...] Bell also added, [...] "Sure it's been hard for me to be a spot player, especially because my body isn't ideal for that type job.
