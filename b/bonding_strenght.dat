40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study in vitro was to compair the microleakage in pits and {{fissures}} sealed with polyacid modified resin (Dyract™) and resin sealant (Fluoroshield™). Method: In this study, 36 sound permanent premolars were equally distributed into three groups: GI (Flu.), GII (Dyr.) e GC (Control-without sealant). The materials were applied and a DES/RE cycle was processed to simulate a high cariogenic challenge. For immersion in the Silver Nitrate solution (50 %), the roots and anatomic crowns (2 mm over the margin of the material) were protected with nail enamel. After that, the nail enamel was removed and the teeth included in epoxi resin. Each crown was longitudinally seccioned in vestibular-lingual direction, to evaluate the degree of microleakage in the enamel/sealant interface. The marginal microleakege was classified by three examinators and the scores were: 0 -no die penetration, 1 -half die penetration, 2 -complete die penetration. Results: The results were statistically analised by ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney (p< 0. 05), the medium posts were: GI (35. 97), GII (37. 53), GC (90. 00).

Objective To evaluate the bond strength of a composite resin to different glass ionomer cements, when using a two-step conventional and self-etching adhesive systems. Material and method Three glass ionomer cements (Ketac Molar Easymix, Vitremer and Vitrebond), the composite resin Filtek Z 350 XT and the adhesive systems Adper Single Bond 2, Clearfil SE Bond and Adper Easy One were used. As negative control, resin was bonded to cement without using an adhesive system. Holes (4 mm diameter, 2 mm deep) prepared in acrilic bloks were filled with the glass ionomer cements (n= 12 /group). On the surface, an area of 1 mm in diameter was delimited, the adhesive system was applied, and a specimen of composite resin with 1 mm height was made. After 24 hours storage (37 °C and 100 % humidity), the microshear test was performed. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey test for comparison between groups (α= 0. 05). Result The adhesive systems significantly improved the <b>bond</b> <b>strenght</b> of composite resin to glass ionomer cements (p≤ 0. 001).

40|$|Objectives: Aims of {{this work}} were {{prospective}} clinical evaluation and in vitro analysis of an etch & rinse/two-steps adhesive and a self-etch/one-step adhesive in class V resin-composite restorations. Methods: 52 teeth with cervical lesions were selected from 14 patients and randomly divided in two groups: group A assigned to a beginner operator, group B to a dentist with 15 -year experience. Groups were then randomly divided in two subgroups: etch & rinse adhesive was used in subgroups A 1 and B 1 (Gluma Comfort Bond, Heraeus Kulzer), while self-etch adhesive was used in subgroups A 2 and B 2 (iBond, Heraeus Kulzer). Class V cavity’s margins were placed on both enamel and cement. All the restorations were performed using the same resin-composite and evaluated at baseline and 12 -month, following Hickel’s criteria. Further follow-up will be performed at 24 and 36 -month. Micro-tensile laboratory tests were performed to evaluate the <b>bond</b> <b>strenght</b> of the two adhesives, thus comparing in vitro Vs in vivo results. Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney statistical tests were {{used to compare the}} adhesives performance and the operators, respectively. Results: Clinical evaluation at baseline and 12 -month follow-up demonstrated no statistical difference between the clinical performance of the adhesives and the two operators. On the other hand, there was a statistical significant difference between baseline and 12 -month follow-up (decrease), in both groups, for the following: polishing procedure, post-operative sensitivity and marginal adaptation. Under laboratory conditions, the etch & rinse adhesive gave better results than the self-etch adhesive, even if statistically significant differences could only be found on enamelparticularly in terms of adhesion on enamel. Conclusions: This study suggests that both etch & rinse and self-etch adhesives can be recommended for clinical use in class V resin-composite restorations, either for a beginner operator than for an expert one. The 36 -month follow-up results are needed to confirm these preliminary data...|$|R

The resin adhesives were formulated with Bis-GMA, TEGDMA, HEMA or PEG 400 UDMA, CQ and EDAB, besides ytterbium fluoride (YbF 3) or silica (SiO 2) nanoparticles were added. The adhesives were analyzed using degree of conversion, radiopacity, refractive index, flexural strength, flexural modulus, water sorption and solubility tests. The bond strength to dentin after 24 h and 6 months of water storage was also performed. Data were statistically analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey test (α= 5 %). The minimal concentration in mass of 20 % was necessary for the PEG 400 UDMA-based adhesives become radiopaque, and of 30 % for the HEMA-containing adhesives. In the overall analysis, the physical properties investigated were maintained or improved by addition of nanoparticles. The adhesion to dentin after 6 months of water storage was negatively affected within the SiO 2 -based groups, but YbF 3 hampered the adhesion degradation within the HEMA-containing adhesive, although within the PEG 400 UDAM-based adhesive it resulted in decrease of microtensile <b>bond</b> <b>strenght.</b> The incorporation of nanofillers into dental adhesives seems to be an interesting way to achieve enhanced properties, although the domain of this technology still needs further further studies to better understand the effect of incorporation of fillers and/or with their surface treatment.

Para isso, primers autocondicionantes foram formulados a partir da mistura de GDMA-P, HEMA ou UDMA PEG 400, etanol e água. Os adesivos de cobertura foram formulados com Bis-GMA, TEGDMA, HEMA ou UDMA PEG 400, CQ e EDAB, além de nanopartículas de trifluoreto de itérbio (YbF 3) ou sílica (SiO 2). Os adesivos foram avaliados por testes de grau de conversão, radiopacidade, índice de refração, resistência flexural, módulo flexural, sorção e solubilidade em água e resistência de união à dentina após 24 h ou 6 meses de imersão em água destilada. Os dados foram analisados estatisticamente com ANOVA e teste complementar de Tukey (α= 5 %). A concentração mínima de 20 % em peso (carga) foi necessária para adesivos contendo UDMA PEG 400 tornarem-se radiopacos, e de 30 % em peso (carga) para os adesivos contendo HEMA. De maneira geral, as propriedades físicas avaliadas foram mantidas ou melhoradas a partir da adição das partículas. A adesão à dentina após 6 meses de armazenagem em água foi prejudicada nos grupos contendo sílica, porém o YbF 3 protegeu a degradação da adesão no adesivo contendo HEMA, embora no adesivo contendo UDMA PEG 400, ele resultou em redução da adesão. A adição de partículas nanométrica em adesivos odontológicos é uma estratégia viável para aprimorar o desempenho desses materiais...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo neste estudo foi avaliar a influência de diferentes concentrações do ácido fluorídrico (AF) na morfologia da superfície/interface, assim como a resistência de união ao microcisalhamento de dois tipos de cerâmica vítrea: (1) IPS Empress Esthetic (EST), (Ivoclar Vivadent) e (2) IPS e. max Press (EMX), (Ivoclar Vivadent), unidas ao cimento resinoso (Variolink II, Ivoclar-Vivadent), com ou sem aplicação do adesivo (Ad) após a aplicação do silano. Blocos cerâmicos com 8 × 8 × 2 mm de espessura foram separados em 12 grupos, totalizando 24 grupos, de acordo com as concentrações do ácido fluorídrico: 1 %, 2, 5 %, 5 %, 7, 5 %, 10 % e 15 %. O tempo de condicionamento para a cerâmica EST foi 60 segundos e para EMX, 20 segundos. Todos os blocos foram silanizados após o condicionamento ácido e a sigla 'Ad' nos grupos designados recebeu a aplicação de uma camada de adesivo após a aplicação do silano. Caracterização dos padrões de condicionamento e {{interfaces}} de união foram conduzidas pela análise em MEV. Para o ensaio de microcisalhamento, cilindros de cimento resinoso foram confeccionados sobre a superfície da cerâmica condicionada, fotoativados durante 40 segundos e armazenados durante 24 horas em água destilada a 37 °C. Os dados foram submetidos à Análise de Variância de 3 fatores e ao teste de Tukey (p< 0, 05). As imagens de MEV mostraram pobre condicionamento quando utilizado a concentração de 1 %, para EST e EMX. HF 2, 5 % mostrou grande remanescente de fase vítrea e ranhuras pouco profundas na superfície das cerâmicas. Padrões semelhantes de condicionamento foram encontrados para HF 7, 5 % e HF 10 %. Canais profundos foram encontrados para HF 15 %. Espaços não preenchidos foram encontrados na interface de grupos que não receberam a aplicação do adesivo. O preenchimento desses espações foi encontrado quando se utilizou o adesivo, mostrando uma interface mais contínua e homogênea. Para o teste de microcisalhamento, os resultados não mostraram diferença estatística entre as cerâmicas EST e EMX. Grupos que receberam o adesivo mostraram valores estatisticamente maiores do que o grupo sem adesivo e HF 10 % e HF 15 % mostram valores estatisticamente maiores comparados ao HF 1 % e HF 2, 5 %. Conclusão: A concentração do ácido fluorídrico influenciou na topografia da superfície e nos valores de resistência de união ao microcisalhamento. O adesivo resultou em maiores valores de união e mostrou-se capaz de criar uma interface mais homogênea, resultando em interfaces mais "entrelaçadas" e provavelmente essa característica pode fornecer interfaces mais confiáveis. The objective on {{this study}} was to evaluate the influence of hydrofluoric acid (HF) concentration on the surface/interface morphology, also the microshear <b>bond</b> <b>strenght</b> on two types of ceramic: (1) IPS Empress Esthetic (EST), (Ivoclar Vivadent), (2) IPS e. max Press (EMX), (Ivoclar Vivadent), bonded to a resin cement (Variolink II, Ivoclar-Vivadent), with or without application of an unfilled resin (UR) after silane application. Each type of ceramic blocks with 8 mm × 8 mm × 2 mm in thickness were separated into 12 groups (n= 6), totaling 24 groups, according to the hydrofluoric acid concentration: 1 %, 2. 5 %, 5 %, 7. 5 %, 10 % and 15 %. Etching time was fixed in 60 seconds for EST and 20 seconds for EMX. All the groups were silanated after etching and the acronym 'UR' on the designated groups received a layer of an unfilled resin after silane application. Characterization of the etching patterns and bonding interfaces was conducted by SEM. For the microshear bond test, resin cylinders were built on the etched ceramic surface, photoactivated during 40 seconds and stored in distilled water during 24 hours, 37 °C, for later evaluation in a universal testing machine. The data were submitted to three-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (p< 0. 05). SEM images showed that poor etching was detected when using HF 1 % on EST and EMX groups. HF 2. 5 % resulted in large remnants of vitreous phase and shallow grooves on ceramic surface. Similar etching patterns were detected for HF 7. 5 and 10 %. Deep channels were extensively observed on surfaces etched with HF 15 %. Unfilled voids underlying the ceramic-resin cement interface were detected in groups that did not receive the application of the unfilled resin. Fully completion of the irregularities was detected using unfilled resin. Overall, when both silane and unfilled resin were applied, all groups generally showed more continuously and homogeneous interfaces. For microshear bond test, the results showed no statistical difference among EST and EMX. Groups with unfilled resin showed statistical higher microshear bond values than groups that did not received this treatment and HF 10 % and HF 15 % showed statistical higher values compared to HF 1 % and HF 2. 5 %. Conclusion: Hydrofluoric acid concentration influenced the ceramic topography and microsher bond strength values. Unfilled resin seems to create more homogeneous interfaces and its application was able to infiltrate the unfilled voids beneath the ceramic-resin cement interface, resulting in more entangled interfaces and probably this feature could result in more reliable interfaces...|$|R
