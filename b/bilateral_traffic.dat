Despite the economic importance of trade in timber and forest products, major international timber consumer countries, such as the EU, have no legal means to halt the import of illegally sourced forest products, because the identification of illegally logged or traded timber is technically difficult. Therefore, a legal basis for normative acts against timber imports or other products manufactured out of illegal wood is missing. Scientific methods to pinpoint the geographic origin of timber are currently under development. [...] Possible actions to restrict imports cannot meet with WTO regulations of non-discrimination.

The adverse conditions of resource dependence push populations into trafficking networks while traffickers and trafficking victims are drawn to economic opportunity in more stable regional trade partners. This theory is tested using ordinal logistic and OLS regression, utilizing cross sectional and time series datasets that capture both trafficking flows and state efforts to combat trafficking. The analyses support the theoretical expectation that economic linkage between resource dependent states and industrial states is positively associated with human trafficking rates for both destination and source countries.

40|$|Abstract: This paper aims {{to explain}} the long-run {{determinants}} of euro area FDI to the United States during the period 1980 - 2001. The theoretical model developed in this paper incorporates the traditional FDI model based on the OLI-framework into the Tobin’s Q-model of investment. The model is estimated using the fixed effects panel estimator, with the euro area proxied by a panel involving most of the euro area countries. In accordance to the theoretical model, the investment climate in the euro area, as reflected in Tobin’s Q – including a measure adjusted for economic developments common to both the United States and the euro area- is found to influence euro area FDI to the United States. Moreover, {{the inclusion of the}} Tobin’s Q seems to enhance the traditional OLI framework specification by adding further explanatory power to the FDI equation. Overall, the empirical findings suggest that euro area patents (ownership advantage), various variables related to productivity in the United States (location advantage), the volume of <b>bilateral</b> telephone <b>traffic</b> to the United States relative to euro area GDP (location advantage), Tobin’s Q and the real exchange rate (capital gains) are statistically significant determinants of euro area FDI to the United States...|$|R

However, since 2009 the country has witnessed a boom in tourism, while an unprofitable SriLankan Airlines changed its financial and strategic circumstances by becoming a member of the Oneworld alliance in mid- 2014, driven by its regional geography and proximity to India which had strict <b>bilateral</b> <b>traffic</b> rights for international incumbents from the UK and the UAE.

40|$|For {{the five}} Central Eastern European {{countries}} Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia (CEEC 5), European Union membership will foster {{economic development and}} trade with Western Europe. Greater division of labour and growing demand for goods, services and international travel, driven by rising income levels, are pushing up the growth of cross-border transport of people and goods. Passenger traffic is further multiplied by commuter traffic {{in the wake of}} the free movement of labour. The Austrian transport network will be burdened not just by <b>bilateral</b> <b>traffic</b> but also by transit traffic between the CEEC 5 and Western Europe. With car ownership in the CEEC 5 still at a relatively low level, it is expected that the growth of passenger traffic will primarily affect road transport. If the road transport of goods were completely liberalised, as foreseen in the acquis communautaire, this would lead to unchecked growth of heavy-goods traffic to and from the CEEC 5. If we assume that the CEEC 5 will join the EU in 2004, that road use will not be subject to serious price increases and that the infrastructure capacities will be adapted to the growth of traffic on an ongoing basis, source-destination heavy-goods transport would quadruple by 2015, and transit traffic would grow fivefold in comparison to 1994. Source-destination rail transport, on the other hand, would grow by just 20 percent and rail transit traffic is expected to double up to 2015. In spite of considerable modal split shifts to the road, the share of cross-border road transport of goods with the CEEC 5 would take until 2015 to attain the level already current in cross-border goods traffic within the EU.

40|$|From {{last two}} decades the {{development}} {{in the field of}} Telecommunication and by the birth of VoIP has totally revolutionized the voice transmission over copper mediimi. With regard to the economic aspects, the packetization of voice using Voice over IP has given rise to new international telecommunications carriers. These carriers have distributed network architectures using the Internet as a platform. VoIP networks have an architecture offering {{the most efficient way to}} implement multilateral telecommunications agreements, thus eliminating the need for carriers to engage in hundreds of <b>bilateral</b> <b>traffic</b> agreements as is required between traditional circuitswitched PSTN carriers. The primary benefits of deploying VoIP are cost saving, cost reduction, and ability to provide enhanced telecommunications features, functions and applications. Businesses can achieve financial benefits form VoIP through reduced upfront capital expenditures for installing converged network, ongoing cost saving for a single managed network which provides voice and data service together and the opportunity of second tier carriers which offer cheap long distance phone calls to users. Since the birth of VoIP two main standards have emerged for signalling and control for the transmission of voice over packet network: ITU-T H. 323 and the IETF Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). These protocols almost provide same end-to-end services and signalling function with different approaches. H. 323 was first developed to work on ATMs for multimedia transmission. Later it was enhanced with additional functionality to support end-to-end voice transmission. Where as SIP was developed keeping in mind the exact requirement for voice transmission with less overhead. Although H. 323 is slightly complex suite of protocol, it is widely deployed by vendors. ITU-T group is has enhanced their research to make H. 323 more simpler protocol While lETF-SIP is already favours a lightweight approach based on HTTP with less complexity.

Five of the 41 (12 %) had developed malocclusion, but did not experience any pain in the temporomandibular joint according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders. There was a significant negative relation between the presence of pain and the duration of follow up (p = 0. 02). Increasing age was significantly related to reduction in the intensity of pain (p = 0. 03). Of the remaining 30 patients who were not followed up, 2 had had bilateral sagittal split osteotomy and 1 a Le Fort I osteotomy. One patient had had orthodontic correction for a malocclusion. Including the five malocclusion patients, at least 9 of the total of 71 (13 %) developed a malocclusion after conservative treatment. Functional impairment had no influence on the intensity of pain or pain-related disability in the patients with malocclusion after conservatively treated bilateral condylar fractures.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{tremendous}} interest in the growth of low-cost airlines in Europe operating from regional and secondary airports. These have been entirely in the short-haul sector, however. Intercontinental services remain dominated by a few large airports such as London Heathrow, Frankfurt, Paris CDG and Amsterdam. This paper examines the recent development of long-haul services and shows that some of the medium sized European airports have seen their network reduced in the last decade, while it also appears more difficult to replicate Ryanair’s use of obscure minor airports in the long-haul arena. Possible means of providing long-haul links to European regional airports are examined. Continental Airlines is launching new routes from New York to places such as Belfast and Bristol with the Boeing 757 offering around 150 seats. These obviously depend upon the hub feed at the US end to gather a much wider range of North American destinations together. Emirates has ambitious plans to serve more European airports from its rapidly growing hub at Dubai. Already it offers the only eastbound long-haul flight out of Scotland (Glasgow-Dubai). Routes between smaller airports catering for the visiting friends and relatives market have developed where there has been historical migration. These are typically at low frequencies. Canada has services from Europe such as Cardiff-Toronto and Lyon-Montreal. Hamburg has a link to Accra in Ghana, Las Palmas (Canary Islands) to Havana, Cuba and Birmingham to Ashgabat in Turkmenistan. In some cases it is possible to support a service through a second stop in Europe (e. g. Lisbon-Porto-Caracas). Low frequency services are also to be found catering for the holiday market such as to Florida or the Caribbean (e. g. Dusseldorf-Orlando). In the absence of any direct long-haul service, connections via a European hub are necessary to access intercontinental points from regional airports in Europe. International alliances between airlines are shown to have been a mixed blessing in this respect. They have generally widened connection opportunities via the major hubs and led to more competitive through fares becoming available. However, some secondary and regional hubs have been run-down in favour of major hubs in the same alliance (which may be in a different European country), reducing accessibility from smaller and more peripheral regional airports. Examples include London Gatwick which has the main London service from many smaller UK airports such as Jersey, Inverness and Plymouth but has been run down as a long-haul hub by British Airways and Copenhagen, which now has very limited long-haul service by SAS; instead a double-change is required from many small Scandinavian airports to reach Star Alliance services out of Frankfurt. The growth of low-cost short-haul airlines such as Ryanair and easyjet may have reduced fares for local passengers but has reduced global connectivity where they have driven a traditional hub airline off the route. A good example is Belfast in Northern Ireland which used to have a link to Amsterdam by KLM. They have been displaced by easyjet, which is fine for passengers only travelling to Amsterdam but beyond there is no longer co-ordinated scheduling and through fares to KLM’s global network. If a passenger does attempt to connect via Amsterdam it will usually cost them more than previously and if anything goes wrong, the connection is ‘at their own risk’. The scope for a long-haul low-cost airline is examined. It is demonstrated {{that it is difficult to}} obtain a sufficient cost advantage in long-haul for a ‘no-frills’ all-economy class product. This is because the major airlines are able to obtain very high yields from their first and business class traffic (one full fare first class passenger with a lie flat bed may be paying the equivalent of 40 deeply discounted economy excursion fares). This enables airlines to offer the seats at the back of the aircraft based on a very low marginal cost. It is difficult to increase aircraft and crew utilisation as this is already high on intercontinental sectors. Cargo is less easy to ignore as it provides significant extra revenue on long-haul flights although introduces complexity. It is also difficult to eliminate all ‘frills’ on flights of 8 or 12 hours duration: even if charged for it is necessary to maintain food service (galley space) and in-flight entertainment, while keeping standard provision of toilets, baggage handling etc. The cost saving from using secondary airports is marginal for long distance traffic where it forms a much smaller proportion of total costs. Many of these smaller airports have runway length or apron/terminal space insufficient to handle widebody aircraft. Hub feed is much more crucial for long-haul services: there are few dense routes (mainly Virgin Atlantic’s long-haul network from London plus Paris-New York). Intercontinental services from Frankfurt or Amsterdam typically depend on connections for 70 - 80 % of their <b>traffic.</b> <b>Bilateral</b> air services agreements between governments also restrict the opportunities for long-haul services from regional airports. When the UK-India bilateral was renegotiated to allow extra flights, the three British carriers applying all wanted to use this scarce capacity from London Heathrow rather than any regional airport. Other bilaterals may specifically name the capital city only in the route schedule. It is concluded that the best scope for long-haul services from the regions is to major hub airports in other parts of the world, such as those developed by Emirates and Continental. Opportunities for point-to-point leisure services fall into two main categories: ethnic links and holiday destinations (some of which may already exist as charters). A long-haul low-cost ‘no-frills’ air service is likely to be a risky venture but carriers such as easyJet may be tempted to try this from their bases in secondary airports such as London Stansted or Berlin Schonefeld if profits falter on their European network, using their short-haul services to provide feed. Otherwise, the regional airports are in the hands of the major airlines or alliance groups and their European feeder operations. Important links are currently under threat from lack of capacity for small aircraft at the major hubs, run-down of secondary hubs and competition from low-cost airlines for short-haul traffic. ...|$|R
