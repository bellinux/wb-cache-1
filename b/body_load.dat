50|$|<b>Body</b> <b>load</b> is the {{specific}} tactile sensations {{brought on by}} psychoactive drugs, especially psychedelics. Generally, <b>body</b> <b>load</b> is an unpleasant physical sensation {{that is difficult to}} describe either in terms of other sensations or in its specific location. However, it could be likened to an instinct of the body sensing it is about to be placed under exceptional stress, a state of pre-shock. Nausea may be present with, or as a part of, <b>body</b> <b>load.</b> Different drugs may cause different <b>body</b> <b>load</b> sensations which vary in intensity and duration.|$|E
50|$|Effects: Enhancement of reading, no visuals or <b>body</b> <b>load.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{causes of}} the {{experience}} of <b>body</b> <b>load</b> are unknown. However, one proposed mechanism is the stimulation of serotonergic 5-HT receptors, particularly those involved in tactile sensation and, equally importantly in many cases where nausea is experienced, those located along the lining of the digestive tract. Serotonin is heavily involved in appetite control, and over-stimulation of serotonergic receptors has been shown to cause nausea in overdoses of SSRIs or MDMA. Many psychedelics which can cause <b>body</b> <b>load</b> are partial serotonin agonists, which work by mimicking the structure of serotonin to varying degrees.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} load on the modulation of cutaneous reflexes, evoked by sural nerve stimulation, electromyographic activity in different leg muscles (tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius medialis (GM), biceps femoris, and soleus muscles (SO)) was recorded in healthy humans during treadmill walking with different <b>body</b> <b>loads.</b> Sural nerve stimulation was applied at two times perception threshold during different phases of the step cycle. Reflex amplitudes increased with body unloading and decreased with <b>body</b> <b>loading.</b> The reflex responses were not a simple function {{of the level of}} background activity. For example, in GM and SO, the largest reflex responses occurred during walking with body unloading, when background activity was decreased. Hence, stable ground conditions (<b>body</b> <b>loading)</b> yielded smaller reflexes. It is proposed that load receptors are involved in the regulation of cutaneous reflex responses in order to adapt the locomotor pattern to the environmental conditions. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Flatbeds became {{rare in the}} 1980s as the {{majority}} of road freight changed to either containers or pallet loads carried on larger and more efficient trucks, optimised for quicker loading by fork-lift trucks. Containers are carried on specialised semi-trailers with twistlocks in the corners to retain the container. Pallet loads are carried in either box <b>bodies,</b> <b>loaded</b> through rear doors, or curtain-sided <b>bodies</b> <b>loaded</b> through the sides. Both of these protect loads from the weather and can be quickly loaded with standard loads, but are more restrictive for single bulky loads, loaded by crane. The haulage and logistics business also changed {{around the same time}} as a greater proportion became more regular in nature, such as standard daily loads of equally-sized boxes from a distribution centre to a supermarket, rather than the unpredictable ad hoc nature or earlier road transport.|$|R
5000|$|Alpha,N-DMT, or α,N-dimethyltryptamine, is a lesser-known {{psychedelic}} drug. It is the α,N-dimethyl [...] analog of DMT. α,N-DMT {{was first}} synthesized by Alexander Shulgin. In his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved), Shulgin lists the dosage as 50-100 mg, and the duration as 6-8 hours. α,N-DMT causes an unpleasant <b>body</b> <b>load.</b> Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of α,N-DMT.|$|E

50|$|Propynyl, or 4-propynyloxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is a lesser-known {{psychedelic}} drug. It {{is closely}} related in structure to mescaline. Propynyl was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin. In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved), the minimum dosage is listed as 80 mg, and the duration listed as 8-12 hours.

5000|$|The elbow is {{a complex}} joint, bears 60% of <b>body</b> <b>load,</b> and tolerates {{problems}} less well than the hips.

The surgery is classified as of 2010 as a [...] "salvage" [...] operation - that is, a last resort for an otherwise viable animal. Success rates of around 80 - 85% (approximately 5 in 6) were being discussed by sources in 2005 and again in 2008.|$|E
50|$|Claims of {{subjective}} differences in effect between the acetylated and not acetylated forms of psilocin; some users report that O-acetylpsilocin lasts slightly longer; others report that it lasts for a considerably shorter time. Many users report less <b>body</b> <b>load</b> and nausea compared to psilocin. Some users {{find that the}} visual distortions produced by O-acetylpsilocin more closely resemble those produced by DMT than those produced by psilocin. These differences could be possible if psilacetin is active itself and not merely as a prodrug. Despite this, {{there have been no}} controlled clinical studies to distinguish the effects between psilacetin, psilocin, and psilocybin.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The scaled {{boundary}} {{finite element}} method caters well for soil-structure interaction problems, but the formulation does not cater {{for the presence of}} changing pore pressures with time, <b>body</b> <b>loads</b> and tractions.

5000|$|Shallow {{coiled tubing}} trucks, {{sometimes}} called bobtail units or <b>body</b> <b>load</b> units. These units are used on wells {{that are less}} than 5,000 feet deep and usually are mounted on traditional single steering axle and tandom rear axle semi trucks. Some larger shallow units are mounted on tandem steering and tridem rear axle trucks. These units traditionally use 1" [...] to 1.50" [...] tubing and have 660 CFM air compressors mounted on the truck for self-contained air to keep the well service as economic as possible. An example of a service provider {{of this would be}} Titan Oil and Gas Services.|$|E
50|$|Effects {{are similar}} to the related 2C-T-7, but 2C-T-2 is said to produce more of a <b>body</b> <b>load</b> and other {{reactions}} which can be unpleasant, reported effects being reddening of the face and warm flushes. It can also be very nauseating while coming up, some users report a period of restlessness during the come up and feeling cold. There have been no reported deaths from 2C-T-2, unlike 2C-T-7, and the psychedelic effects have been much milder. The onset usually starts after an hour of ingestion and rises for about two hours until the user hits the plateau. Insufflated doses reach a peak much faster and have been compared to the effect of ketamine on the body.|$|E
5000|$|... 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) is a {{psychedelic}} drug and a substituted amphetamine. Unlike other substituted amphetamines, however, {{it is not}} a stimulant. DOI has a stereocenter and R-(−)-DOI is the more active stereoisomer. In neuroscience research, 125I-R-(−)-DOI is used as a radioligand and indicator of the presence of 5-HT2A serotonin receptors. DOI's effects have been compared to LSD, although there are differences that experienced users can distinguish. Besides the longer duration, the trip tends to be more energetic than an LSD trip, with more <b>body</b> <b>load</b> and a different subjective visual experience. The after effects include residual stimulation and difficulty sleeping, which, depending on the dose, may persist for days. While rare, it is sometimes sold as a substitute for LSD, or even sold falsely as LSD, which may be dangerous because DOI does not have the same established safety profile as LSD.|$|E
