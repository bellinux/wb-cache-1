40|$|The {{conflict}} of interest amongst the professionals like client and contractor’s project managers, site engineers, quantity surveyors and designers/architects play crucial roles for the unethical practices, consequently these practices have adverse impact on the product quality, faith of clients and investors’ confidence {{in the construction industry}}. Hence, this research is aimed at examining the common forms of unethical practices among professionals in the construction industry as well as revealing the key factors that have encouraged these practices. This study depends on the questionnaire survey amongst professionals of the construction industry. The survey is conducted to recognise the view of key stakeholders from different perspectives of the affected parties on the concept of business ethics in the building and construction industry, which play key role in contributing to the national economic growth of the countries. The survey concludes that untimely legal action including changing project manager’s responsibility and delays in payment processes are key ethical practices from owner/client aspect, while contractor’s unethical practices are under bidding, <b>bid</b> cutting and <b>shopping,</b> <b>bid</b> rigging and over billing. But from the consultant aspect; lack of supervision, poor monitoring and taking bribes under different pretend are found to be the encouraging factors for unethical conducts in the construction industry. It is also found that accepting the bribes, gifts and conflicts of interest are the most common forms of unethical practices. The findings from the study is expected to help as an important eye opener to policy makers and regulatory agencies in detecting and preventing unethical practices. In conclusion, avoiding the {{conflict of}} interest and promoting the ethic codes to professionals will help to restore the investor and people confidence, faith of the clients and improve the quality of buildings and infrastructures. The study recommends that promoting awareness regarding the values of ethical behaviour at different forum and ensuring the effective punishment for unethical activities at different stages of project life cycle might reduce the unethical practices in the construction industry...|$|R

50|$|TASMAC was {{established}} in 1983 by the Chief Minister M. G. Ramachandran (MGR) for wholesale vending of alcohol in Tamil Nadu. The state {{has a long history}} of prohibition, first implemented partially in 1937 by the Indian National Congress government of C. Rajagopalachari. Between 1973 and 2001, it was lifted briefly during 1971-74, 1981-87 and 1990-91. After 1983, TASMAC was in charge of wholesale liquor sales in the state whenever prohibition was lifted. In 2001, prohibition was lifted again and TASMAC became the wholesale monopoly for alcohol. For retail vending, the state auctioned off licenses for running liquor shops and bars. But this led to the formation of cartels and loss of revenue to the state. The government tried to counter this by introducing a lot system from the financial year 2001-02, where potential bidders <b>bid</b> for <b>shops</b> grouped by revenue. But the lot system could not prevent cartelisation, as bidders later withdrew in favour of others. In October 2003, the government passed an amendment to the Tamil Nadu Prohibition Act, 1937, making TASMAC the sole retail vendor of alcohol in the state. By 2004 all private outlets selling alcohol were either shut down or taken over by the company. This monopoly established by the ADMK government of J. Jayalalitha came into effect on 29 November 2003. The DMK government of M. Karunanidhi which took power in 2006, did not revise its predecessor's policy and TASMAC continues to control the alcohol industry in the state.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Among e-Government systems, the Korea ON-line E-Procurement System (KONEPS) {{is unique}} in that it {{requires}} the automated completion {{of a wide variety}} of jobs across the entire procurement process: from exchanging documents, opening <b>bids,</b> contracting, and <b>shopping</b> and paying electronically to sharing information on goods, services, and participants. KONEPS is also a rare example of a successful government-administered e-procurement system that has saved a great deal of money and time in the Government-to-Business procurement process. Most e-procurement system studies focus on a rhetorical analysis of case studies and do not employ rigorous methods, making them un-suitable for assessment by potential customer countries. This study proposes a generalized approach to estimating the performance of e-procurement systems by integrating the Monte Carlo-Assisted Causal Mapping Simulation (MOCA-CAMS). Simulations in which MOCA-CAMS is applied to KONEPS indicate a very promising performance for KONEPS under uncertain conditions in cus-tomer countries. This study will provide a foundation for further discussion of this increasingly important area of e-procurement research and practice...|$|R
40|$|In [Bohte et al., 2001] a {{competitive}} distributed recommendation mechanism is introduced based on adaptive software agents for efficiently allocating the "consumer attention space", or banners. In the instance of an electronic shopping mall, {{the task of}} correctly profiling and analyzing the consumers is delegated to the individual shops that operate in a distributed, remote fashion. The evaluation and classification of consumers for the bidding on banners is not handled by a central agency as is customary, but is a distributed process where all <b>shops</b> <b>bidding</b> for a consumer partake. This allows each shop to apply its own private strategy, learning mechanism and specific domain knowledge. Here we present a scalable, and extensible software agent architecture and prototype for distributed market-based allocation of consumer attention space. The prototype has an architecture suitable for supporting agents in a distributed bidding application where agents run on dedicated machines for maximum computational resources. Furthermore, as an extension, the agents can operate in multiple independent markets concurrently...|$|R
40|$|With the {{explosion}} of service based web application like online news, <b>shopping,</b> <b>bidding,</b> libraries great amount of information is available.

The collaborative filtering technique based recommender system may suffer with cold start problem i. e. new user problem and new item problem and scalability issues. Traditional K-Nearest Neighbor Technique also suffers with user and item cold start problem. In this paper recommender system generates suggestions for user by combining collaborating filtering on transaction data with rating predicted with user demographics and item similarity. The final rating is weighted sum of ratings computed from transaction data, user data and item data. The advantage of proposed system that recommender system can deal with cold start in case of "new user " or “new item ”. and Also system has low MAE and RMSE in comparison of traditional collaborative filtering based on K-Nearest Neighbor approach...|$|R

40|$|M. Sc. (Computer Science) Agent {{technology}} {{has become more}} common in mainstream applications as it allows systems to perform routine operations without input from human users. The current evolution {{of the internet and}} the increasingly distributed nature of commercial interests, such as <b>bidding</b> auctions, personal <b>shopping</b> assistants and corporate management systems, require software in a distributed environment to be capable of acting autonomously. Multi-agent systems have emerged to deal with these distributed environments which can range in size from a couple of agents to potentially infinite agents [Vla 03, Rus 03]. When considering a cooperative multi-agent system, it is important for agents to coordinate effectively. Strategic game theory has introduced a means to coordinate by providing social conventions and roles [Vla 03]. Both social conventions and roles help simplify the coordination problem between agents when performing coordination actions. An additional simplification of the coordination problem is to utilise coordination graphs. This reduces the number of agents in the environment to consider for a coordination action [Gue 02]. Communication in multi-agent systems extends the ability of agents to coordinate with one another. It allows the removal of the requirement to determine the state of participating agents by inspection. Instead, an agent could request the state of another agent by utilising a communication action. Communication does require an additional level of management since agents are rarely allowed to communicate freely and the communication language is not always guaranteed to be standard between agents [Cha 02, Vla 03]. The dissertation covers the background information regarding multi-agent systems and focuses on the elements that are unique to these systems, such as coordination, communication and methods to represent knowledge structures in a multi-agent system. A model is then proposed as a framework in which scalable populations of agents are able to coordinate when limited knowledge is available about other agents in the environment. The model, which is called the Controller Operator Graph (COG) model, introduces two unique agent types which help coordinate a large population of agents. The unique agents are provided to assist with communication and coordination in the COG model. The COG model is designed to help agents coordinate in a dynamic environment by providing mechanisms to monitor agent population and goal states. The operator agent is responsible for maintaining communication links between agents and provides the ability to monitor a population of agents for the multi-agent system. The controller agent is responsible for ensuring that coordination actions are performed between agents which have no prior knowledge of one another. It provides a means to handle a dynamic situation in which the coordination actions can be extended beyond the original requirements. An implementation of the COG model is provided utilising a supply chain scenario which compares increasing agent populations. The COG implementation demonstrates by means of unified modelling language diagrams a method to design and develop the different concepts in the COG model, such as the execution tree, controller agent and operator agent. The implementation demonstrates the strengths of the COG model, which are handling dynamic environments and achieving dynamic goal states for the environment. The implementation also indicates some of the weaknesses in the COG model, such as greedy agent selection by the controller agent, and single points of failure...|$|R

40|$|Main {{contractors}} use <b>bid</b> <b>shopping</b> {{to reduce}} a subcontractor's quoted price. The {{literature suggests that}} this is a practice disliked by many subcontractors and that the subcontractor's loss of revenue and margin is an important consequence. The vast majority of subcontractors in New Zealand are small in size, thus <b>bid</b> <b>shopping</b> can lead to subcontractors having greater exposure to additional financial risk, arising from the reduced margins they must accept. Whilst <b>bid</b> <b>shopping</b> has been mentioned as part of research on issues such as ethics and tendering practice, few empirical studies have directly focussed on <b>bid</b> <b>shopping,</b> and specifically, sought the perceptions of subcontractors themselves on the effects of <b>bid</b> <b>shopping</b> on their business. A questionnaire-based semi-structured interview survey of subcontractors was conducted, seeking their opinions on the prevalence, and seriousness of, <b>bid</b> <b>shopping,</b> what the effects of it are, and what measures they took to prevent their quotes from being bid shopped. The results established that <b>bid</b> <b>shopping</b> takes place regularly and is a matter of much concern to subcontractors, having a negative influence on their pricing decisions {{and the quality of the}} work they do. It also places more stress on the subcontractor‟s staff and limits the growth of their business.

40|$|Over {{the course}} of history, the {{construction}} industry has been greatly affected by the effects of unethical practices made by owners, contractors and subcontractors. This study examines those practices, known as <b>bid</b> <b>shopping,</b> {{and its effects on}} the private sector of the construction industry. <b>Bid</b> <b>shopping</b> is primarily used by contractors and subcontractors to gain an unfair advantage over their clients, competition and subcontractors during the bidding process. Common consequences of <b>bid</b> <b>shopping</b> include lawsuits from contractors, subcontractors and vendors, refusal of the shopped party to sign a contract, compromised quality of workmanship, disregard toward safety measures, severed relationships among construction professionals and inflated bids. Education of construction professionals at the earliest stage possible is crucial to prevent the practice from happening.
