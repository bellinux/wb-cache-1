5|$|During these years, Harrison {{exhibited}} {{a number of}} personality quirks that became legendary. One was his habit of calling in subordinates to dine {{with him in the}} executive dining room by sending them a <b>blue</b> <b>chip</b> that had the meal's conversational topic written on it. Usually the topics were intellectual rather than related to the running of the railroad. Another oddity was his refusal to use his railroad pass, which entitled him to free travel. Instead, he personally paid for his commute between his home and the railroad's offices.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 2012, he was at first unable {{to qualify for the}} 2012 Elite 11 in his home region, but participated in a second {{regional}} contest and was named MVP, earning an invitation. Morris was described as having the strongest arm of the 25 quarterbacks at the Elite 11 finals, although he did not finish in the top 11 of the competition. On September 6, 2012, he was the first quarterback selected to participate in the January 4, 2013 Under Armour All-America Game for high school seniors. As he was attempting to regain momentum following his battle with mononucleosis, he was reported to have been unimpressive in the week of practice and in the game. In the game, he was notable for being the recipient of a vicious tackle by Matthew Thomas, who was the top-ranked outside linebacker in the class of 2013 according to ESPN. The Detroit News named him as the top prospect in the state of Michigan on their 2013 <b>Blue</b> <b>Chip</b> List.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Ezeh {{entered his}} senior season as {{the focal point of}} his school's running game and was rated as the seventh-best {{football}} prospect in the state of Michigan, according to The Detroit News. He was also invited to try out for the United States national rugby union team as an outside center. During the season, Ezeh was regularly among the leading rushers in the area. In the Division 4 state semifinal game, Ezeh returned a kickoff 80yards for a touchdown and rushed for 136yards on 24 carries. During the game, after Catholic Central scored on a quarterback sneak with 2:28 remaining, Ezeh scored on a two-point conversion to give his team a 3534 victory. This led them to the 2005 MHSAA state championship game at Ford Field, which they lost 1710 to Powers Catholic High School. By the end of the season, Ezeh had compiled a school record 2,914 career rushing yards, which included 33 touchdowns. During his senior year, he also occasionally played linebacker, recording 34 tackles (16 for a loss). Although, he missed part of the season with an ankle injury, he totaled 1,391yards and 10 touchdowns on 217 carries and added seven pass receptions, including one touchdown, and he was recognized as a 2nd-team All-area running back. The Detroit News recognized him as their postseason number six <b>blue</b> <b>chip</b> prospect in the state, and he was selected to play in the Michigan High School Football Coaches Association's annual all-star game. In February 2006, he signed his letter of intent to play for Michigan, where it was unclear whether he would play fullback, tight end or linebacker.|$|E

25|$|The judges {{decided to}} seize 46billion {{differences}} in value of Shin Corp. shares {{from the date}} {{when he came to}} office and the value when the shares were sold to Singapore's Temasek Holdings in early 2006.

Nevertheless, during that period, Shin shares gained 121%, compared with a 128% gain in the benchmark SET index, while Siam Cement, one of Thailand's premier <b>blue</b> <b>chip</b> companies, gained 717%. The judges did not find that Thaksin was guilty of malfeasance. They also noted that any benefit to the government from Thaksin's policies was irrelevant to the ruling.
