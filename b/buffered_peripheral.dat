It defines the Hierarchical Stack Resource Policy, an appropriate global resource access policy that bounds priority inversion and also limits interference due to overruns during resource access. The paper provides detailed response time analysis enabling the schedulability of application servers and tasks to be determined for systems with local and global resource access. This analysis is applicable to real-world systems where server-based applications need mutually exclusive access to shared resources such as communications <b>buffers,</b> <b>peripheral</b> devices, operating system calls and data structures shared with interrupt handlers...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{examined the}} role of syllables in writing Spanish words. In Experiment 1, participants had to write single words that were aurally presented. The interletter intervals (ILIs) between critical letters were measured. Longer ILIs {{were found in the}} intersyllabic than the intrasyllabic condition. In Experiment 2, the inputs were pictures to remove any potential phonological bias stemming from the input stimulus. Results suggested that the linguistic nature of the input is not determining the output. Post hoc analyses revealed that other characteristics of the stimuli cannot explain the results. These results indicate that syllables are essential units of processing in writing Spanish and that central processes related to spelling and the graphemic <b>buffer</b> affect <b>peripheral</b> processes at movement execution...|$|R

Every device attaches to the SCSI bus in a similar manner. Up to 8 or 16 devices can be attached to a single bus. There can be any number of hosts and peripheral devices but there should be at least one host. SCSI uses handshake signals between devices, SCSI-1, SCSI-2 have the option of parity error checking.

30|$|Because the {{cantilever}} sensors {{are often}} coated {{on one side}} {{with one or more}} metal layers for subsequent chemical or biological functionalisation, care must be given to ensure a steady temperature. Fluctuations in temperature will result in the cantilever deflecting due to the difference in the thermal expansion coefficients of the silicon and the metal layers. Thermal fluctuations affect the viscosity and density of the liquid and therefore the oscillation frequency of the sensors. To ensure a steady temperature, the fluid chamber, the <b>buffers,</b> samples and <b>peripheral</b> equipment such as optics are all housed within a small refrigeration/heating unit (Intertronic, Interdiscount, Switzerland). A silent, vibration free fan (Zalman, Seoul, Korea) helped maintain a uniform temperature within the refrigeration unit.|$|R
40|$|Given the {{increasing}} anthropogenic pressures on forests, the various protected areas [...] national parks, sanctuaries, and biosphere reserves [...] {{serve as the}} last footholds for conserving biological diversity. However, because protected areas are often targeted {{for the conservation of}} selected species, particularly charismatic animals, concerns have been raised about their effectiveness in conserving nontarget taxa and their genetic resources. In this paper, we evaluate whether protected areas can serve as refugia for genetic resources of economically important plants that are threatened due to extraction pressures. We examine the population structure and genetic diversity of an economically important rattan, Calamus thwaitesii, in the core, <b>buffer</b> and <b>peripheral</b> regions of three protected areas in the central Western Ghats, southern India. Our results indicate that in all the three protected areas, the core and buffer regions maintain a better population structure, as well as higher genetic diversity, than the peripheral regions of the protected area. Thus, despite the escalating pressures of extraction, the protected areas are effective in conserving the genetic resources of rattan. These results underscore the importance of protected areas in conservation of nontarget species and emphasize the need to further strengthen the protected-area network to offer refugia for economically important plant species...|$|R

In On Demand Multicast Routing Protocol (ODMRP), the multicast members send Join Replies to the periodic Join Queries {{initiated by the}} source, to maintain their membership. In this work, we present a mechanism to selectively cache the packets with the Forwarding Group members. This effectively distributes the retransmission responsibility among intermediate nodes.

Through this <b>peripheral</b> <b>buffer</b> based approach we are able to provide reliable multicast without any increase in control overhead.

40|$|The {{percentages}} of forest lost during the 1991 - 2007 inside of and adjacent buffer of the JNP were 4. 8 % and 0. 2 %, respectively. The degree of fragmentation of remnant forest habitats has also drastically increased. The number of forest patches has increased and the patch size and core area have decreased. This is mainly {{due to the}} road construction and second-home construction from 1991 to 2007 for all counties. The potential capacity to conserve species richness of the JNP has been decreasing in recent years due to the development activities such as road and 2 nd home construction in areas adjacent to the JNP. Core areas used by the reintroduced Asiatic Black Bears have also been negatively effected. &#x 9;Wise control of development activities in the <b>peripheral</b> <b>buffer</b> of the JNP {{is essential to the}} biodiversity conservation and the future expansion of bear habitat to the national backbone ecological corridor, or Baekdudaegan. |$|R
40|$|Limited memory {{bandwidth}} is {{a critical}} bottleneck in modern systems. 3 D-stacked DRAM enables higher bandwidth by leveraging wider Through-Silicon-Via (TSV) channels, but today's systems cannot fully exploit them due to the limited internal bandwidth of DRAM. DRAM reads a whole row simultaneously from the cell array to a row buffer, but can transfer {{only a fraction of}} the data from the row <b>buffer</b> to <b>peripheral</b> IO circuit, through a limited and expensive set of wires referred to as global bitlines. In presence of wider memory channels, the major bottleneck becomes the limited data transfer capacity through these global bitlines. Our goal in this work is to enable higher bandwidth in 3 D-stacked DRAM without the increased cost of adding more global bitlines. We instead exploit otherwise-idle resources, such as global bitlines, already existing within the multiple DRAM layers by accessing the layers simultaneously. Our architecture, Simultaneous Multi Layer Access (SMLA), provides higher bandwidth by aggregating the internal bandwidth of multiple layers and transferring the available data at a higher IO frequency. To implement SMLA, simultaneous data transfer from multiple layers through the same IO TSVs requires coordination between layers to avoid channel conflict. We first study coordination by static partitioning, which we call Dedicated-IO, that assigns groups of TSVs to each layer. We then provide a simple, yet sophisticated mechanism, called Cascaded-IO, which enables simultaneous access to each layer by time-multiplexing the IOs. By operating at a frequency proportional to the number of layers, SMLA provides a higher bandwidth (4 X for a four-layer stacked DRAM). Our evaluations show that SMLA provides significant performance improvement and energy reduction (55 %/ 18 % on average for multi-programmed workloads, respectively) over a baseline 3 D-stacked DRAM with very low area overhead...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{patterns}} of genetic structure, gene flow and diversity across a species range is required {{if we are}} to determine the genetic status and viability of small peripheral populations. This is especially crucial in species distributed across a large range where spatial heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict the distribution of genetic diversity. Although biogeographical models provide expectations of how spatially structured genetic variation may be at the range scale, human disturbance may cause strong deviations from these theoretical predictions. In this study, we investigated genetic structure and demography at a pan-European scale, in the corncrake Crex crex, a grassland bird species strongly affected by agricultural changes. We assessed population structure and genetic diversity, as well as demographic trends and direction of gene flow, in and among 15 contemporary populations of this species. Analyses revealed low genetic structure across the entire range with high levels of genetic diversity in all sites. However, we found some evidence that the westernmost populations were, to a very limited extent, differentiated {{from the rest of the}} European population. Demographic trends showed that population numbers have decreased in western Europe and remained constant across eastern Europe. Results may also suggest asymmetric gene flow from eastern to western populations. In conclusion, we suggest that the most likely scenario is that contrasting demographic regimes between eastern and western populations, driven by heterogeneous human activity, has caused asymmetric gene flow that has <b>buffered</b> small <b>peripheral</b> populations against genetic diversity loss, but also erased any genetic structure that may have existed. Our study highlight the need of coordinated actions at the European scale to preserve source populations and ensure the maintenance of reproductive productivity in the most threatened sites, in order to avoid losing any adaptive potential and too strongly relying on sink source populations whose future is uncertain...|$|R
40|$|Jirisan {{national}} park (IUCN status 2) {{is the first}} {{national park}} (1967) and the biggest national park (472 km^ 2 ^) in Korea. In the first trial on the species restoration, since 2004, Asiatic Black Bears (Ursus thibetanus ussuricus) reintroduced from North Korea and Russia have been conserved in the park. Development activities around the Jirisan national park (JNP) have been isolating the habitat for many wildlife species. The objectives {{of this study are}} to identify the trend of wildlife habitat isolation caused by the development activities in areas adjacent to the JNP, analyze the trend of habitat fragmentation by using selected fragmentation indices and discuss landscape ecological implications of habitat fragmentation around the JNP. We use satellite data to estimate the extent of forest habitat and loss for the period 1991 - 2007 within the park and in a 5 km <b>peripheral</b> <b>buffer.</b> The temporal trends of habitat fragmentation of five counties in the study area were analyzed and compared using selected fragmentation indices of FRAGSTATS. The implications of the loss of forest within JNP and adjacent buffer were discussed through the calculation of the species richness capacity (SRC). |$|R
40|$|Abstract: Biosphere Reserves {{are areas}} of in situ {{conservation}} of biodiversity. They are subdivided into a central area, <b>buffer</b> zones and <b>peripheral</b> areas. People settled into villages around {{the periphery of the}} Biosphere Reserve of Niokolo Koba. The socio-economic activities of those rural populations are largely dominated by agriculture and pastoralism. Business of forest products {{and to a lesser extent}} tourism, are also observed. Other forms of activities such as beekeeping, fishing and hunting are practiced. A stratified random sampling technique was used to collect data on diversity and actual trends in population dynamic of woody plant species under the pressure of human activities. The number of woody plant species decreased from far away vegetation’s layers to those next to human settlements. The shrub savannah is the most represented vegetation unit but patches of degraded forest galleries were also identified. The woody plant species of the biosphere reserve could be grouped into four categories with respect to their economic importance. Species exploited for firewood and charcoal have a generally viable population with a tendency to domination by Combretum species known as “Combretinisation ” in the entire area. Species exploited for timber products are scattered throughout the area and show unbalanced populations. Plan...|$|R

He started on his first padayatra (walkathon) through the villages of the area in 1986, educating to rebuild villages' old check dams. Yet their bigger success was yet to come, as inspired by the walkathon and success at Gopalpura, 20 km away, in 1986, people of Bhanota-Kolyala village with through shramdaan (voluntary labour) {{and with the help}} of TBS volunteers, constructed a johad at the source of a dried Arvari River, following this villages that lay in its catchment area, and along it also built tiny earthen dams, with largest being a 244-meter-long and 7-meter-high concrete dam in the Aravalli hills; eventually when the number of dams reached 375, the river started to flow again in 1990, after remaining dry for over 60 years. Yet the battle was far from over, even after constructing johads, the water level in the ponds and lakes around Sariska didn't go up as expected, that it went they discovered that missing water got evaporated from mining pits left unfilled by the miners after their operations in the area. A legal battle ensued, they filed public interest petition in the Supreme Court, which in 1991 banned mining in the Aravallis. Then in May 1992, Ministry of Environment and Forests notification banned mining in the Aravalli hill system all together, and 470 mines operating within the Sariska sanctuary buffer area and periphery were closed. Gradually TBS built 115 earthen and concrete structures within the sanctuary and 600 other structures in the <b>buffer</b> and <b>peripheral</b> zones. The efforts soon paid off, by 1995 Aravri became a perennial river. The river was awarded the `International River Prize', and in March 2000, then President, K. R. Narayanan visited the area to present the [...] "Down to Earth — Joseph. C. John Award" [...] to the villagers. In the coming years, rivers like Ruparel, Sarsa, Bhagani and Jahajwali were revived after remaining dry for decades. Abandoned villages in the areas got populated and farming activities could be resumed once again, in hundreds of drought-prone villages in neighbouring districts of Jaipur, Dausa, Sawai Madhopur, Bharatpur and Karauli, where work of TBS gradually spread.|$|R
40|$|Parks and {{reserves}} {{have been}} found to be effective in preventing habitat destruction and protect ecosystem within their borders. Recent studies however found extensive loss of tropical forest habitat around protected areas, contributing vastly to increase their level of ecological isolation. Using high resolution satellite data we investigated the isolation trend occurring in the W-Ary-Pendjari (WAP) ecological complex in West Africa. A land cover change analysis was performed for the period 1984 - 2002 : savanna vegetation extension and loss were derived within the complex and in a 30 -Km <b>peripheral</b> <b>buffer.</b> Sample regions in the buffer were also analyzed using selected spatial indicators to quantify temporal trends in habitat fragmentation. Implications for change in relative capacity to conserve biodiversity were discussed through the calculation of the Species Richness Capacity (SRC). More than 14. 5 % of savannah habitat was lost in the WAP peripheral areas, while 0. 3 % was converted inside the complex. The degree of fragmentation of remnant savanna habitat has also drastically increased. Despite the effectiveness of the park conservation program, we found through the SRC approach that the WAP complex is decreasing its potential capacity to conserve species richness. This process is mainly due to the rapid and extended agricultural expansion taking place around the complex. A better understanding of the ecological dynamics taking place in the reserves’ peripheral regions and the consideration of development needs are key variables to achieve conservation goals in protected areas.

However, the means for modulating cytokine production are not yet fully investigated. In this study we report the effects of a herbal melanin, extracted from Nigella sativa L., on the production of three cytokines [tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL- 6) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) ], by human monocytes, total peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and THP- 1 cell line. Cells were treated with variable concentrations of melanin and the expression of TNF-α, IL- 6 and VEGF mRNA in cell lysates and secretion of proteins in the supernatants were detected by RT-PCR and ELISA. Melanin induced TNF-α, IL- 6 and VEGF mRNA expression by the monocytes, PBMC and THP- 1 cell line. On the protein level, melanin significantly induced TNF-α and IL- 6 protein production and inhibited VEGF production by monocytes and PBMC. In the THP- 1 cell line melanin induced production of all three cytokine proteins. These observations raise the prospects of using N. sativa L. melanin for treatment of diseases associated with imbalanced cytokine production and for enhancing cancer and other immunotherapies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background We {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2 (VEGF-R 2) -positive cells induced from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells can differentiate into both endothelial cells (ECs) and mural cells (MCs) and these vascular cells construct blood vessel structures in vitro. Recently, {{we have also}} established a method for the large-scale expansion of ECs and MCs derived from human ES cells. We examined the potential of vascular cells derived from human ES cells to contribute to vascular regeneration and to provide therapeutic benefit for the ischemic brain. Methods Phosphate <b>buffered</b> saline, human <b>peripheral</b> blood mononuclear cells (hMNCs), ECs-, MCs-, or the mixture of ECs and MCs derived from human ES cells were intra-arterially transplanted into mice after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Results Transplanted ECs were successfully incorporated into host capillaries and MCs were distributed in the areas surrounding endothelial tubes. The cerebral blood flow and the vascular density in the ischemic striatum on day 28 after MCAo had significantly improved in ECs-, MCs- and ECs+MCs-transplanted mice {{compared to that of}} mice injected with saline or transplanted with hMNCs. Moreover, compared to saline-injected or hMNC-transplanted mice, significant reduction of the infarct volume and of apoptosis as well as acceleration of neurological recovery were observed on day 28 after MCAo in the cell mixture-transplanted mice. Conclusion Transplantation of ECs and MCs derived from undifferentiated human ES cells have a potential to contribute to therapeutic vascular regeneration and consequently reduction of infarct area after stroke. </p...|$|R
