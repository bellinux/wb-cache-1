This paper both discusses the health and health disparities of Latino migrants in the U. S {{as well as the}} issues in La Plata County. As well as examines the explanatory models behind these disparities, including discussions of issues of access to healthcare in terms of monetary barriers, structural barriers, and cultural barriers. It is important to understand the disparities for this demographic and the explanatory models that offers explanations to these disparities, to contextualize personal research. Personal research explored; how migration changes certain risk factor behaviors and stressors as well as access that can contribute to the health disparities between Latinos and non-Latinos. The hypothesis for this study; there will be significant differences within the Latino population in Durango before and after their migration to the United States. Differences in behavior, stressors and access to healthcare are the result of high risk factors and significant healthcare disparities between Latinos and non-Latinos. Through a mixed methods survey of 25 participants, data shows that certain risk factor behaviors and stressors increase after migration, such as a decrease in fruit and vegetable consumption and less of a social and emotional support. The survey also explored issues of access by seeing if barriers to accessing healthcare changed after migrating. After migrating participants reported less issues with institutional barriers, but a huge increase in cultural barriers to healthcare, while monetary barriers was an issue both before and after migrating. With this information, we now have a <b>basic</b> <b>needs</b> <b>assessment</b> for Latino migrants in our community. To lessen these health disparities we must work from a community and personal level to provide information on nutrition as well as create support systems for Latino Migrants in our community. By discussing health disparities and identifying behaviors, stressors and issues of access that perpetuate these disparities, it is possible to increase the health of Latino migrants in our community...|$|E

Method: A cross sectional interview study of people with a primary physical disability, aged 16 ± 65. Disabled people were randomly selected from two existing disability registers, which comprised disabled people who had been identified by community rehabilitation services as being in need of regular surveillance by formal assessment of their care needs. A new semi-structured <b>needs</b> <b>assessment</b> questionnaire was developed and validated for the study (the Southampton <b>Needs</b> <b>Assessment</b> Questionnaire, SNAQ).

The thesis explores the most appropriate way of conducting a <b>needs</b> <b>assessment,</b> relating to HIV/AIDS services in a particular community; thereafter the <b>needs</b> <b>assessment</b> was carried out. This qualitative research study is conducted using participatory methods and techniques. The research reviews literature pertaining to HIV/AIDS, specifically in Africa, South Africa and the Eastern Cape and incorporates a discussion on the concept of community, community development and poverty. The design of the <b>needs</b> <b>assessment</b> tool, implementation and analysis is conducted through focus group discussions and individual semi-structured interviews. The theory on participatory approaches and community development are central to this study. The study found that HIV / AIDS as an issue is not perceived by the community under study to be an immediate need in light of <b>basic</b> <b>needs</b> being identified as priority. The use of participatory methods in this study highlighted the diversity within communities. Service providers who wish to initiate community - based projects need to take note of diversity and personal interests of individuals or groups who become involved in community- based projects. The study further highlighted the need for service providers to provide training, to their staff in participatory approaches and techniques, before embarking on community development projects.
