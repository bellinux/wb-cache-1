50|$|The Savage GT is {{featured}} in the December 1991 issue of Mopar Collector's Guide. In the article it states that only 10 to 13 were originally built, yet it gives no <b>breakdown</b> by <b>engines</b> nor transmission. There were nine 340's, three 383's, and one 440 built. Currently there are 3 known to exist as of 2013, two 340 and one 383 car.|$|R
50|$|The {{prototype}} {{took part}} in the 2nd Polish Light Aircraft Contest in 1928, but did not complete it due to <b>engine</b> <b>breakdown.</b> In 1929 it undertook a raid around Poland. It was scrapped in winter of 1929/1930.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>breakdown</b> van, <b>engine</b> {{and tender}} were all driven forward 3.5 metres. The engine {{collided}} with an [...] "H" [...] wagon {{that was being}} re-railed which, in turn, was driven forward into another five goods wagons. Members of the rescue gang, {{who had been working}} on the [...] "H" [...] wagon, were crushed beneath the wreckage. An additional breakdown train was sent to the crash site from Toowoomba at 10am. Fifty workers dug frantically in the wreckage to free trapped workers, however six had died due to horrific injuries received in the collision.|$|R
500|$|During a short {{service career}} marred by {{repeated}} <b>engine</b> <b>breakdowns,</b> U-41 sank one ship, the French steamer Amiral Charner of [...] U-41 was at Cattaro at war's end, and was ceded to France {{as a war}} reparation in 1920. She was towed to Bizerta and broken up within a year.|$|R
50|$|On 29 April, Schuylkill got {{underway}} from Ulithi {{toward the}} California coast. Steaming singly, she zigzagged her {{way across the}} Pacific and arrived at San Pedro {{on the morning of}} 17 May for an overhaul, repairs, and alterations. On 13 July, during post-repair sea trials, the replenisher oiler suffered an <b>engine</b> <b>breakdown</b> and was towed back to the harbor for repairs which were completed on 23 July.|$|R
50|$|Yak-25 {{was first}} {{displayed}} at Tushino in July 1955, {{and received the}} NATO designation Flashlight-A. They started to equip air defence units from 1955. They were considered easy to fly and popular among the crews. Quite common were <b>engine</b> <b>breakdowns,</b> mostly due to the low engine position when on the ground, which demanded clean airfields, but thanks to twin-engine arrangement, few such failures were fatal.|$|R
25|$|There is {{also the}} {{uncertainty}} that your non-action would {{have led to the}} death of the five people, as e.g. the trolley might have suffered an <b>engine</b> <b>breakdown</b> before hitting the five.

60|$|As soon as {{they were}} on board of the Shohirika again, the cruiser started after the battleship. But the enemy had a good lead, and it was some time before the Japanese warship could command a full head of steam, which meant {{everything}} to her. Then, when steam was to be had in plenty, there came a <b>breakdown</b> in the <b>engine</b> room, causing a delay of twenty minutes.|$|R

50|$|Timing belts must be {{replaced}} at the manufacturer's recommended distance and/or time periods. Failure to replace the belt can result in complete <b>breakdown</b> or catastrophic <b>engine</b> failure, especially in interference engines. The owner's manual maintenance schedule {{is the source of}} timing belt replacement intervals, typically every 30,000 to 50,000 miles (50,000 to 80,000 km). It is common to replace the timing belt tensioner {{at the same time as}} the belt is replaced.|$|R
40|$|For many years, engine overhearing {{has been}} the major cause for vehicle <b>breakdowns</b> and <b>engine</b> {{malfunctions}} for most teams in Endurance events at Formula Society of Automotive Engineers (FSAE) Series competitions. Additionally, with a growing importance of aerodynamics to the overall success of the Global Formula Racing at these events, {{in addition to an}} internal need for engine cooling, the side-pods have been a large focus of redesign for the 2014 season. The side-pods, which house oil and water radiators for engine cooling, are responsible for providing adequate airflow to maintain stable engine operating temperatures, while increasing downforce and reducing drag on the vehicle. This thesis details the complete design and manufacturing processes, followed by testing simulations and physical validation of the 2014 side-pods on the Global Formula Racing combustion and electric vehicles...|$|R
50|$|After commissioning, Baddeck {{was sent}} to Halifax on 29 May 1941. In June 1941 the ship was tasked with escorting the SS Lady Rodney from Quebec City to Halifax, but was forced {{to return to her}} {{builders}} following an <b>engine</b> <b>breakdown.</b> In September 1941, she managed to escort the SS Lady Rodney from Halifax to Jamaica despite again experiencing engine failure. After her repairs were completed she {{was sent to}} Newfoundland to serve as an ocean escort.|$|R
5000|$|The Algoma (Official #85766) {{was built}} in 1883 by Aitken & Mansell in Glasgow, Scotland, {{for use by the}} Canadian Pacific Railway Company. [...] The Algoma was 262 feet long, with a 38-foot beam, a depth of 23 feet, [...] and {{measured}} 1750 tons as originally built.

40|$|Throughout the {{evolution}} of rotorcraft design, great advancements {{have been made in}} developing performance analysis and sizing tools to assist designers during the preliminary and detailed design phases. However, very few tools exist to assist designers during the conceptual design phase. Most performance analysis tools are very discipline or concept specific, and many are far too cumbersome to use for comparing vastly different concepts in a timely manner. Consequently, many conceptual decisions must be made qualitatively. A need exists to develop a single software tool which is capable of modeling any type of feasible rotorcraft concept using different levels of detail and accuracy in order to assist in the decision making throughout the conceptual and preliminary design phases. This software should have a very intuitive and configurable user interface which allows users of different backgrounds and experience levels to use it, while providing a broad capability of modeling traditional, innovative, and highly complex design concepts. As an illustration, a newly developed Concept Independent Rotorcraft Analysis and Design Software (CIRADS) will be presented to prove the applicability of such software tools. CIRADS is an object oriented application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for specifying mission requirements, aircraft configurations, weight component <b>breakdowns,</b> <b>engine</b> performance, and airfoil characteristics. Input files from the GUI are assembled to form analysis and design project files which are processed using algorithms developed in MATLAB but compiled as a stand alone executable and imbedded in the GUI. The performance calculations are based primarily upon a modified momentum theory with empirical correction factors and simplified blade stall models. The ratio of fuel (RF) sizing methodology is used to size the aircraft based on the mission requirements specified by the user. The results of the analysis/design simulations are then displayed in tables and Text Fields in the GUI. The intent for CIRADS is to become a primary conceptual sizing and performance estimation tool for the Georgia Institute of Technology rotorcraft design teams for use in the annual American Helicopter Society Rotorcraft Design Competition.

Piotr Dudziński (SP-PZL) took the 11th place and Ignacy Giedgowd (SP-PZM) the 17th place (by coincidence, these results were similar to those of PZL.19s, two years earlier). Giedgowd's engine failed during a maximum speed trial, though. It is noteworthy, that they had the 2nd and 4th results of average speed in the rally - 211 and 213 km/h.|$|R

50|$|Tiger I tanks {{needed a}} high degree of support. It {{required}} two or sometimes three of the standard German Sd.Kfz. 9 Famo heavy recovery half-track tractors to tow it. Tiger crews often resorted to using another Tiger to tow the damaged vehicle, but this was not recommended as it often caused overheating and <b>engine</b> <b>breakdown.</b> The low-mounted sprocket limited the obstacle clearance height. The tracks also had a tendency to override the rear sprocket, resulting in immobilisation. If a track overrode and jammed, two Tigers were normally needed to tow the tank. The jammed track was also a big problem itself, since due to high tension, it was often impossible to split the track by removing the track pins. The track sometimes had to be blown apart with a small explosive charge.|$|R
5|$|However, {{problems}} with the combat system, excessive noise, and <b>engine</b> <b>breakdowns</b> were recurring and appeared across the entire class. These and other shortcomings were often made harder to solve by disagreements between Kockums, ASC, Rockwell, the RAN, and the Australian Government over the nature of problems, their causes, and {{who was responsible for}} solving them. Media reporting of the problems during the mid-1990s was often negative and exaggerated, creating poor public perception. This was aided by politicians, who used the shortcomings to politically attack the Labor Party and Kim Beazley, particularly after Labor was defeated by the Liberal-National Coalition in the 1996 federal election, and Beazley became Leader of the Opposition. During the mid-1990s, it was recommended on several occasions that the submarine project be abandoned, and the completed submarines and incomplete hulls be broken up for scrap.|$|R
