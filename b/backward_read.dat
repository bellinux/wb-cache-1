40|$|In {{indexing}} of, {{and pattern}} matching on, DNA and text sequences, {{it is often}} important to represent all factors of a sequence. One e cient, compact representation is the factor oracle (FO). At the same time, any classical deterministic nite automaton (DFA) can be transformed to a so-called failure one (FDFA), which may use failure transitions to replace multiple symbol transitions, potentially yielding a more compact representation. We combine the two ideas and directly construct a failure factor oracle (FFO) from a given sequence, in contrast to ex post facto transformation to an FDFA. The algorithm is suitable for both short and long sequences. We empirically compared the resulting FFOs and FOs on number of transitions for many DNA sequences of lengths 4 - 512, showing gains of up to 10 % in total number of transitions, with failure transitions also taking up less space than symbol transitions. The resulting FFOs {{can be used for}} indexing, as well as in a variant of the FO-using backward oracle matching algorithm.

40|$|Abstract Background Almost all {{cognitive}} functions decline with age. Results {{of previous studies}} have shown that cognitive training related to everyday life (reading aloud and solving simple arithmetic calculations), namely learning therapy, can improve two cognitive function (executive functions and processing speed) in elderly people. However, it remains unclear whether learning therapy engenders improvement of various {{cognitive functions}} or not. We investigate the impact of learning therapy on various cognitive functions (executive functions, episodic memory, short-term memory, working memory, attention, reading ability, and processing speed) in healthy older adults. Methods We use a single-blinded intervention with two parallel groups (a learning therapy group and a waiting list control group). Testers are blind to the study hypothesis and the group membership of participants. Through an advertisement in local newspaper, 64 healthy older adults are recruited. They will be assigned randomly to a learning therapy group or a waiting list control group. In the learning therapy group, participants are required to perform two cognitive tasks for 6 months: reading Japanese aloud and solving simple calculations. The waiting list group does not participate in the intervention. The primary outcome measure is the Stroop test score: a measure of executive function. Secondary outcome measures are assessments including the following: verbal fluency task, logical memory, first and second names, digit span forward, digit span <b>backward,</b> Japanese <b>reading</b> test, digit cancellation task, digit symbol coding, and symbol search. We assess these outcome measures before and after the intervention. Discussion This report is the first study which investigates the beneficial effects of learning therapy {{on a wide range of}} cognitive functions of elderly people. Our study provides sufficient evidence of learning therapy effectiveness. Most cognitive functions, which are correlated strongly with daily life activities, decrease with age. These study results can elucidate effects of cognitive training on elderly people.

40|$|Recent {{studies by}} Berent and Perfetti (1995) and Lee, Rayner, and Pollatsek (2001) {{have shown a}} {{processing}} priority of consonants over vowels in tasks like <b>backward</b> masking and <b>reading,</b> respectively. One possible explanation for this advantage of consonants {{is in terms of}} the specific characteristics of the English spelling (i. e., a great inconsistency in the spelling-sound relations for vowels), and therefore is not predicted for a language, like Italian, with a transparent orthography. The aim of the present experiments was to investigate the consonant advantage in Italian with the backward masking paradigm. The first two experiments, with a perceptual identification and a naming task, showed a masking reduction effect for masks sharing vowels with the target at the shortest SOAs, in addition to a pseudo-homophone advantage as compared to the control condition. In the third experiment, where a lexical decision task was used, the advantage of the mask sharing vowels disappeared. The fourth experiment was a replication of Experiment 1 with different materials. Overall, the results suggest that the advantage of consonants can only be found in English, whereas in Italian, for which the computation of phonology of vowels and consonants is similar, no effect is apparent. Thus, the processing priority for consonants seems to depend on the inconsistencies of vowel phonology in English...|$|R

40|$|We present {{improved}} practically efficient algorithms {{for several}} string searching problems, where we {{search for a}} short string called the pattern in a longer string called the text. We are mainly interested in the online problem, where the text is not preprocessed, but we also present a light indexing approach to speed up exact searching of a single pattern. The new algorithms can be applied e. g. to many problems in bioinformatics and other content scanning and filtering problems. In addition to exact string matching, we develop algorithms for several other variations of the string matching problem. We study algorithms for approximate string matching, where {{a limited number of}} errors is allowed in the occurrences of the pattern, and parameterized string matching, where a substring of the text matches the pattern if the characters of the substring can be renamed {{in such a way that}} the renamed substring matches the pattern exactly. We also consider searching multiple patterns simultaneously and searching weighted patterns, where the weight of a character at a given position reflects the probability of that character occurring at that position. Many of the new algorithms use the backward matching principle, where the characters of the text that are aligned with the pattern are <b>read</b> <b>backward,</b> i. e. from right to left. Another common characteristic of the new algorithms is the use of q-grams, i. e. q consecutive characters are handled as a single character. Many of the new algorithms are bit parallel, i. e. they pack several variables to a single computer word and update all these variables with a single instruction. We show that the q-gram backward string matching algorithms that solve the exact, approximate, or multiple string matching problems are optimal on average. We also show that the q-gram backward string matching algorithm for the parameterized string matching problem is sublinear on average for a class of moderately repetitive patterns. All the presented algorithms are also shown to be fast in practice when compared to earlier algorithms. We also propose an alphabet sampling technique to speed up exact string matching. We choose a subset of the alphabet and select the corresponding subsequence of the text. String matching is then performed on this reduced subsequence and the found matches are verified in the original text. We show how to choose the sampled alphabet optimally and show that the technique speeds up string matching especially for moderate to long patterns...|$|R
