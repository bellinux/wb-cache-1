5|$|At first, Raziel can jump, glide {{using his}} torn wings, move blocks, {{and pick up}} and throw objects and enemies.

Raziel can freely shift to the spectral realm, <b>but</b> <b>can</b> return to the material realm only through special portals when at full health. Raziel automatically shifts to the spectral realm if he runs out of health. As the game progresses, Raziel gains the powers of his clan brothers after defeating them and becomes able to phase through gates in the spectral realm and climb walls in the material realm. Initially vulnerable to water, he overcomes this weakness and learns to swim.|$|E
