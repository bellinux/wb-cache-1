5|$|In November 2010, a new technocratic {{government}} {{was elected to}} office. In its first 50 days in office, the new administration completed its first monthly payment of stipends to government soldiers. It {{was the first of}} many Somali administrations to announce plans for a full <b>biometric</b> register for the security forces. While it aimed to complete the <b>biometric</b> register within four months, little further was reported. By August 2011, AMISOM and Somali forces had managed to capture all of Mogadishu from Al-Shabaab.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, a new {{contract}} was signed between the Lebanese Directorate General of General Security (DGGS) with a Lebanese company Inkript, a member of Resource Group Holding (RGH), to make the move for <b>biometric</b> passports. Inkript held {{a joint venture with}} French firm Gemalto, based in the Netherlands to participate in the tender. Jacques Seif, General Manager of Inkript, said: “We will handle all the programming and software development in-house, while Gemalto will be in charge of manufacturing the passports and matching the program’s interface with the coding machines.”. The contract’s term is three years, and Inkript will produce four million Lebanese <b>biometric</b> passports. The contract, valued at around 140 million US dollars, was funded by a Saudi grant. The Lebanese Directorate General of General Security (DGGS) announced that it would be issuing <b>biometric</b> passports to all of its citizens starting from July 2016.|$|E

5|$|The <b>biometric</b> {{data that}} is to be {{included}} on the Lebanese passport is the bearer's name, gender, date and place of birth, and a digital image of their face, ten fingerprints, palmprints. Lebanese immigration checkpoints will not be the only ones with the technology to read and authenticate the data from the RFID chip using a fingerprint scanner and facial recognition technology, but widespread adoption of <b>Biometric</b> passport technology around the world has seen the technology installed in international airports in the US, the UK and other countries.|$|E
5|$|Facial {{recognition}} {{technology is}} {{being introduced to}} coincide with the release of the <b>Biometric</b> Passport. This technology will be used to improve identity verification, reduce identity-related fraud, and protect the legal identity of the citizens of the Republic of Lebanon. Similar technology is used in the Lebanese identity card.|$|E
5|$|In February 2014, Chief of Staff Brigadier General Dahir Adan Elmi {{announced}} that Somalia's Ministry of Defence began holding military training {{inside the country}} for the first time, with Somali instructors now teaching courses to units that joined the armed forces. He also indicated that SNA leaders had created new numbered units for the army, and that the soldiers were slated to have their respective name and unit placed on their uniform. Additionally, Elmi stated that the military had implemented a new <b>biometric</b> registration system, wherein each recently trained and armed soldier is photographed and fingerprinted. By the end of 2014, 17,000 national army soldiers and police officers had registered for the new <b>biometric</b> remuneration system. 13,829 SNA soldiers and 5,134 Somali Police Force officials were biometrically registered in the system as of May 2015.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>biometric</b> {{data and the}} personal information stored on the information page, the chip also records the bearer's travel history of the last ten entry and exits at Lebanese border control points (Beirut–Rafic Hariri International Airport, Beirut Naval Base, Port of Beirut, Port of Byblos, and Port of Tripoli).|$|E
5|$|The current {{version is}} in ID1 format and <b>biometric.</b> All 10 {{fingerprints}} and palmprints of the holder are taken, which {{is stored in}} paper files and {{which can only be}} accessed by a judge in closely defined circumstances. A central database duplicates the information on the card, but strict laws limit access to the information and prevent it being linked to other databases or records.|$|E
5|$|Windows 10 {{incorporates}} multi-factor authentication technology {{based upon}} standards {{developed by the}} FIDO Alliance. The operating system includes improved support for <b>biometric</b> authentication through the Windows Hello platform. Devices with supported cameras (requiring infrared illumination, such as Intel RealSense) allow users to log in with iris or face recognition, similarly to Kinect. Devices with supported readers allow users to log in through fingerprint recognition. Credentials are stored locally and protected using asymmetric encryption.|$|E
5|$|Work by Dodson (1975) {{recognized}} {{that there were}} many less taxa present in Alberta. Tetragonosaurus was found to be juveniles of Corythosaurus or Lambeosaurus. T. erectofrons was assigned to Corythosaurus based largely on <b>biometric</b> information. The only non-typic specimen of Tetragonosaurus, assigned to T. erectofrons, was found later to be referable to Hypacrosaurus, although the holotype of the species was still found to be assignable to Corythosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Receipt of Banking Services: A Lebanese Identity Card holder {{can use the}} Lebanese Identity Card as {{identity}} verification document when opening bank account, withdrawing money from the bank or receiving money transfers in the Republic of Lebanon. It is easier for a Lebanese Identity Card holder to also take loan from the bank whether you work in an identifiable institution or not. This is because their identity can be easily verified and the banks are confident {{that they can be}} traced in the event of loan default based on their PIN or <b>biometric</b> information stored on the Lebanese Identity Card.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{approval}} of the new Constitution, the 2009 general election was called. The opposition sought to delay the election by demanding a new <b>biometric</b> registry system, hoping that it would give them time to form a united front against MAS. Many MAS activists reacted violently against the demands, and attempting to prevent this. Morales went on a five-day hunger strike in April 2009 to push the opposition to rescind their demands. He also agreed to allow for the introduction of a new voter registry, but insisted that it was rushed through so as not to delay the election. Morales and the MAS won with a landslide majority, polling 64.2%, while voter participation had reached an all-time high of 90%. His primary opponent, Reyes Villa, gained 27% of the vote. The MAS won a two-thirds majority in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Morales notably increased his support in the east of the country, with MAS gaining a majority in Tarija.|$|E
5|$|Other {{minorities}} lack bumiputera status. 24.6 {{per cent}} of the population are of Chinese descent, while those of Indian descent comprise 7.3 per {{cent of the}} population. The Chinese have historically been dominant {{in the business and}} commerce community, and form a plurality of the population of Penang. Immigrants from India, the majority of them Tamils, began arriving in Malaysia early in the 19th century. Malaysian citizenship is not automatically granted to those born in Malaysia, but is granted to a child born of two Malaysian parents outside Malaysia. Dual citizenship is not permitted. Citizenship in the states of Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysian Borneo are distinct from citizenship in Peninsular Malaysia for immigration purposes. Every citizen is issued a <b>biometric</b> smart chip identity card known as MyKad at the age of 12, and must carry the card at all times.|$|E
25|$|Miller, {{along with}} Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez, {{introduced}} , the <b>Biometric</b> Exit Improvement Act of 2013. The bill would implement a <b>biometric</b> exit {{system that would}} monitor the exit of foreign visitors. The bill would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to implement a <b>biometric</b> exit system for ten airports and ten seaports, test the system for two years, and then implement the system nationwide.|$|E
25|$|Later in 2006, <b>biometric</b> {{passports}} {{were issued}} to the public. Since August 2007, {{the department has}} issued only <b>biometric</b> passports, which include RFID chips. An issued non-biometric will remain valid until its stated date of expiration.|$|E
25|$|In late July 2008, the DFA has {{announced}} plans {{and the possible}} implementation of a new <b>Biometric</b> Passport System for new passports. It is expected {{that the government will}} start issuing <b>biometric</b> passports by the end of 2009. On August 11, 2009, the first <b>biometric</b> passport was released for President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. The e-passport had various security features, including a hidden encoded image; an ultra-thin, holographic laminate; and a tamper-proof electronic microchip costing at around 950 pesos for the normal processing of 20 days or 1,200 pesos for the rush processing of 10 days.|$|E
25|$|Malaysia was {{the first}} {{country in the world}} to issue <b>biometric</b> {{passports}} in March 1998, after a local company, IRIS Corporation, developed the technology. In December 2002, thumbprint data was added to the <b>biometric</b> data on the passport chip. Similar technology is used in the Malaysian identity card, MyKad.|$|E
25|$|Serbian <b>biometric</b> {{passports}} {{were introduced}} on 1 July 2008.|$|E
25|$|A <b>biometric</b> {{passport}} has the e-passport symbol at the bottom. There are 32 {{pages in}} a <b>biometric</b> passport. Frequent travelers may request 52-page passports for no additional cost. Extra visa pages could previously {{be added to}} a passport, but, as of January 1, 2016, the service was discontinued entirely for security reasons.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biometric</b> {{passports}} from August 2009 to August 2016, are {{the only}} Philippine passports which do not require the physical signature of the bearer, as {{an image of the}} bearer's signature is printed onto the passport data page. Physical signatures are once again required for <b>biometric</b> passports issued after August 15, 2016, with the signature field on page 3.|$|E

25|$|The regular {{international}} passport has incorporated <b>biometric</b> features since 1998. The <b>biometric</b> passport {{contains an}} 8 kB microchip which {{was developed by}} a Malaysian technology firm, IRIS Corporation. In February 2010, the passport was updated {{to comply with the}} ICAO standard on <b>biometric</b> and machine-readable passports, while the pages in a 32-page passport was increased to 48 pages. Beginning April 2013, the passport underwent another round of updating by introducing a polycarbonate sheet that holds the passport bearer's information. The information is laser engraved into the polycarbonate sheet for added security, including a hologram mini-photo of the passport bearer. With this the passport now holds 50 pages instead of 48 pages. There is no more 64 pages option since 2011.|$|E
25|$|Bartolomeu Anania, as Metropolitan, {{joined the}} dispute over the <b>biometric</b> passports, signing in 2009 a public {{statement}} (together with all the bishops of his metropolitan see), in which he claimed that the usage of <b>biometric</b> chips in passports is offensive to the Romanian people, whom, he claims, are therefore treated as a potential gang of criminals. He also made clear his worry {{about the possibility of}} using microchip implants.|$|E
25|$|The legal {{driving force}} of <b>biometric</b> {{passports}} is the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002, which states that smart-card Identity cards {{may be used in}} lieu of visas. That law also provides that foreigners who travel to the U.S., and want to enter the U.S. visa-free under the Visa Waiver Program, must bear machine-readable passports that comply with international standards. If a foreign passport was issued on or after October 26, 2006, that passport must be a <b>biometric</b> passport.|$|E
