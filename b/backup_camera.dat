25|$|The reverse parking {{procedure}} is virtually {{identical to the}} parallel parking procedure. The driver approaches the parking space, moving forward and turning, positioning the car in place for backing into the reverse parking spot. The vehicle rear has to be facing the reverse parking spot, allowing the <b>backup</b> <b>camera</b> to 'see' the parking area. Shifting to reverse automatically activates the <b>backup</b> <b>camera</b> system, and the driver selects the reverse park guidance button on the navigation/camera touchscreen (the grid appears with green or red lines, a flag symbol representing {{the corner of the}} parking spot, and adjustment arrows; reverse parking adds rotation selection). After checking the parking space and engaging the reverse park procedure, the same exact parking process occurs as the car reverse parks into the spot.|$|E
25|$|In late 2005 (for the 2006 model year), Toyota {{introduced}} {{some minor}} cosmetic {{changes for the}} XW20, such as a slightly updated front-end, revised instruments, and repositioned rear seats.

50|$|That's when {{we first}} see Marcus appear to Molly's shock and surprise. She and Marcus {{interact}} briefly after she tries to burn her hand to attempt {{to see if the}} person she sees is real. Next we see Molly explaining away 13 lost hours of video from the space station. Gordon Kern, (the deputy director of ISEA) mentions the <b>backup</b> <b>cameras</b> on board the Seraphim, and questions Molly about the lost footage which she explains away (not convincingly to Director Sparks) as a glitch.|$|R
50|$|In the 2010s {{new ways}} to play music came into {{competition}} with the CD and FM radio such as internet radio, satellite radio, electrical connectors and Bluetooth connectors for portable media players, and in-dash slots for memory cards. And the automobile head unit became increasingly important as a housing for <b>backup</b> <b>cameras,</b> navigation systems, and displays for smartphones such as CarPlay, Android Auto, and MirrorLink. Some vehicle manufacturers have their own systems for syncing the car with smartphones, for example: BMW Assist, Hyundai Blue Link, iLane, MyFord Touch, Ford SYNC, OnStar, and Toyota Entune.|$|R
50|$|<b>Backup</b> <b>cameras</b> {{are common}} on {{vehicles}} that tow difficult-to-see trailers, such as motorhomes. Recently, {{with the rise}} in popularity of in-dash DVD players and GPS navigation systems which aid in justifying the expense of adding a color LCD to the driver's seat, they have become much more common, often available as optional factory accessories on standard passenger trucks and sport utility vehicles, as well as aftermarket accessories. Inside the vehicle, the display is typically wired to automatically sense when the transmission is set in reverse, showing the backup view while in reverse, and showing the map (or other content) at all other times.|$|R
