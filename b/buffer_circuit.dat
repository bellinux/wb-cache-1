25|$|The {{separate}} {{range and}} bearing receiver units could {{operate on a}} number of frequency bands. A common oscillator was used by both receivers, which was sent into the four-tube radio frequency (RF) section. The frequency of the oscillator could be switched between two broad bands, LF band from 54.5 to 66.7MHz, and the HF band from 66.7 to 84.0MHz. The receivers were then fine-tuned using conventional rotating iron cores, which were mechanically connected to tune both receivers from a single dial.

The core (known as the force) and the inner shield (known as the guard) are kept at approximately the same electrical potential by a voltage buffer/follower, thus the leakage current between them is zero for all practical purposes, despite the imperfections of the insulation. Instead, the leakage current occurs between {{the inner and outer}} shields, which does not matter since that current will be supplied by the <b>buffer</b> <b>circuit</b> rather than the device under test and will not affect measurements.

Two, a <b>buffered</b> <b>circuit</b> switched network model for an optical core of future internet to capture the randomness in calls or flows present in the network. The maximum weight scheduling algorithm proposed by Tassiulas and Ephremides [IEEE Trans. Automat.
