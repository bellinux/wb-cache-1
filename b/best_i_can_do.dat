500|$|Mays has deemed Emma an [...] "amazing" [...] {{character}} to play, and has explained: [...] "I don't find that female characters are always written {{with a lot}} of depth, but she's so well defined on the page. Sure, she's terrified of germs and in love with a married man, so seeing her as the voice of reason for the kids is amazing." [...] Emma's relationship with Will will continue to grow, as [...] "she has these moments of clarity when she's talking to Will because he calms her." [...] Mays described her in an interview with TheTVChick: [...] "She is a romantic at heart. But she’s practical. She’s very interesting, because she does have those dreams and hopes of finding the right man. And in her mind, even though Will Schuester’s married, that sort of guy is like the perfect guy for her. She’s very practical in the fact that she doesn’t want to be alone and she knows that she’s somewhat limited in a small town to men. And Ken Tanaka is a very nice man, he’s not exactly like Will, but he’s good to her and he’s solid. He’s got a job, and he understands her and he understands all her quirks and stuff. So she’s practical, she knows that just might be her lot in life. So it’s weird. She’s got this very dreamy side about her and who she wants to be and what she wants her life to be like. But she’s also got this very practical, down-to-earth, well this is kind of the <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> thing. It’s funny {{a lot of people have}} thought that part about her is weak. Like a weak character flaw, but I actually don’t think that’s true. I really just think that’s the practical side of her. I think that’s her being practical. And I think a lot of people are like that sometimes." ...|$|E
2500|$|In week 7 Alan Feraday, also of DERA, gave evidence. Feraday {{presented}} {{the court with}} a simulated IED of the type alleged to have caused the sabotage of PA 103. Under cross-examination, he admitted the fragments of radio cassette and timer, found in DC Gilchrist's cloth/debris (charred) material, had not been tested for explosives residue. The defence were, however, later criticized for having failed to challenge Feraday to explain why his note to Detective Chief Inspector William Williamson in September 1989, covering a Polaroid photograph of the timer fragment (identified in May 1989), said it was [...] "the <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{in such a short}} time." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 26, Butch {{was greeted}} at Pearl Harbor by {{a horde of}} reporters and radio announcers. During a radio {{broadcast}} in Honolulu, he enjoyed the opportunity {{to say hello to}} Rita ("Here's a great big radio hug, the <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> under the circumstances") and to his mother ("Love from me to you"). On April 8, he thanked the Grumman Aircraft Corporation plant at Bethpage (where the F4F Wildcat was made) for 1,150 cartons of Lucky Strike cigarettes, a grand total of 230,000 smokes. Ecstatic Grumman workers had passed the hat to buy the cigarettes in appreciation of O'Hare's combat victories in one of their F4F Wildcats. A loyal Camel smoker, Butch opened a carton, deciding that it was the least he could do for the good people back in Bethpage. In his letter to the Grumman employees he wrote, [...] "You build them, we'll fly them and between us, we can't be beaten." [...] It was a sentiment he would voice often in the following two months.|$|E

60|$|The <b>best</b> thing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to wipe my pen, {{and shut}} up my Journal, and go home by the next train.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's unlikely," [...] he {{answered}} in a hard voice. [...] "I've lost my friends with my character. The <b>best</b> thing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to leave them alone." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{record label}} speculated that Eminem {{would be the}} first artist to sell one million copies in an album's first week of release. These {{expectations}} placed a large burden on Eminem, who recalled, [...] "I was scared to death. I wanted to be successful, but before anything, I want respect. [...] " [...] After the album was finished, the record label felt that there were no songs that had potential to be a lead single. Feeling pressured, Eminem returned to the studio and wrote [...] "The Way I Am" [...] as his way of saying, [...] "Look, this is the <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> I can't give you another 'My Name Is. ' I can't just sit in there and make that magic happen. [...] " [...] However, after the song was added to the album, Eminem felt the urge to write another song, and gave a hook to Dr. Dre for him to create a beat, and went home to write new lyrics; the song eventually became [...] "The Real Slim Shady". The song also discusses Eminem killing Dr. Dre. The producer reflected, [...] "It was funny to me. As long as it's hot, let's roll with it ... in my opinion, the crazier it is the better. Let's have fun with it and excite people. [...] " ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{said the}} woman, {{when she had}} raised his head on a roll of damaged cotton, which served for a pillow, [...] "there's the <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, my friend, in {{this matter}} I cannot do my <b>best.</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> nothing. And, indeed, I may say at once, that it is {{altogether}} out of the question. I know--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm on the mainland, that's certain," [...] he told himself. [...] "I {{guess the}} <b>best</b> thing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is {{to wait for}} {{daylight}} before going further. I may only--Hullo, a light!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{might have}} {{told me she was}} tired," [...] Emily said to herself quietly. [...] "Well! the <b>best</b> thing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to put out the light and follow her example." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid it's {{getting too}} much for dear, old dad," [...] was Dick's comment, on perusing this message. [...] "I think the <b>best</b> thing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to get back and help him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is the <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for you," [...] he said, {{stepping}} down and retiring to the path, where he resumed the smoking of his pipe {{as he walked}} up and down.|$|E
6000|$|... "Na, then, the <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{for you is}} to put it by, to be {{sauce for}} the wild-duck the morn; for I think ye said ye were to bide here {{for a day or}} twa." ...|$|E
6000|$|Thornton {{rose to his}} feet. His {{eyes were}} wet. The tears were {{streaming}} frankly down his cheeks. [...] "Sir," [...] {{he said to the}} Skookum Bench king, [...] "no, sir. You can go to hell, sir. It's the <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for you, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am an unlucky devil,' growled Hughie. 'The <b>best</b> thing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{is to go}} to bed; and, my dear Alan, you mustn't tell any one. I shouldn't dare show my face in the Row.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think the}} <b>best</b> thing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{will be to}} go over dad's private papers," [...] said Dick, presently. [...] "They may give me a clew of {{where to look for}} him in New York." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My darling girl,' he replied, {{rallying}} {{more of his}} old manner than he {{had ever}} yet got together. 'On the contrary, I have been thinking whether it is not the <b>best</b> thing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> to die.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Won't do, Tallente," [...] he replied. [...] "We {{have had}} a meeting and decided to publish. The <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for you is to promise that we will publish {{unabridged}} any comments {{you may have to}} make upon the matter, on the following day." ...|$|E
60|$|Yours received. The <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> with it is, {{to refer}} {{it to the}} War Department. The Rock Island case {{referred}} to, was my individual enterprise; and it caused so much difficulty {{in so many ways}} that I promised to never undertake another.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Ralph," [...] she sobbed, [...] "it is very hard, but I {{know it is}} true. I {{have been}} just filled with vanity and pride, and after all I am nothing like as good as she is, nor as good as anybody, and the <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is {{to go back to}} school." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guess the}} <b>best</b> thing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{is to move}} right around the shore of this island," [...] he reasoned. [...] "By doing that I am bound to strike one of the camps, sooner or later." ...|$|R
5000|$|... ("On my honor, {{and with}} the grace of God, I force myself to serve with the <b>best</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> to my church and my homeland, to help my fellow man/woman in any circumstance, and to uphold the Scout Law.") ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe," [...] said Little Joe as {{he wiped}} tears of {{laughter}} from his eyes, [...] "that Grandfather Frog is right, {{and that the}} <b>best</b> thing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is {{to make friends with}} Buster Bear. I'll try it to-morrow morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I do," [...] {{cried the}} stout farmer, {{grasping}} his friend by the hand; [...] "I forgive your being an Englishman, Charlie, and as I can't {{make you a}} Dutchman, the next <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for you is {{to give you a}} Dutch wife, who is in my opinion better and prettier than any English girl that ever lived." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will not," [...] {{says the}} man, [...] "for the covers will not hold ye. Not yet. The <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to enjoy ye meself, {{for the time}} is not ripe for {{destroying}} the limitations of print. Ye would look fantastic in type. All alone by meself must I drink this cup of joy. But, I thank ye, boys; I am truly grateful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{climb over}} me or go around, I don't care which," [...] murmured the lizard. [...] "When they're little, they're juicy; when they're big, there's more of 'em; but either way there's nothing so delicious as a parsnip. There are none {{here in the}} Fog Bank, so the <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is dream of them. Oh, parsnips, par-snips, p-a-r-snips!" [...] He closed his eyes sleepily and resumed his dreams.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{very glad}} to hear that you are taking it like that," [...] Julien remarked, [...] "and I am sure Anne will be. <b>I</b> think the <b>best</b> thing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to go and see her and tell her that you are here--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} you feel about it," [...] began Tom, after he had picked up his comic paper once more and then thrown it aside in disgust. [...] "I begin to think that the <b>best</b> thing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to pack those twins off to Colby Hall." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said McCrae, [...] "I hoped. It seemed, {{to look at}} ye, ye'r true nature--what was {{by rights}} inside of ye. That's the <b>best</b> {{explaining}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> And <b>I</b> call to mind that time ye spoke about not making {{the men in the}} classes Christians--that was what started me to thinking." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{be glad to}} do {{something}} for ye," [...] said he; [...] "but then there's nowhar I could take ye. The <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to tell ye to go thar," [...] said he, pointing to a large white house which stood by itself, off the main street of the village. [...] "Go thar; they're kind folks. Thar's no kind o' danger but they'll help you,--they're up to all that sort o' thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Bacheller {{syndicate}} (117 Tribune Building) want a {{story of}} 5,000 words (lowest limit of their London agent) for $1,000 and offer to plank the check on delivery, and it was partly to meet that demand that I took that other holiday. So as I have no short story that suits me (and can't and shan't make promises), the <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to offer the longer one which I finished on my second holiday--"Tom Sawyer, Detective." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And the {{president}} of the company to come around personally and pay you your dividends on a silver platter," [...] Smoke sneered. [...] "No, sir. You fellows have got to be reasonable. Ten cents on the dollar will help start things. You buy two-fifths of the stock, hundred dollars par, at ten dollars. That's the <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> And if you don't like it, just start jumping the claims. I can't stand more than a two-fifths gouge." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{native of}} Netanya, {{he has been}} riding on a {{motorcycle}} since he was five years old. He has two younger brothers, Tsuk and Suff. [...] "The <b>best</b> thing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is {{to be on the}} bike. Whenever <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> it. (…) Every time <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> I’m going on the bike", Sella stated during the 2017 Africa Eco Race.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} it's right," [...] {{he thought to}} himself, [...] "but it's the <b>best</b> thing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for him. It is evident he must be kept up. When Abe comes down I will ask his advice; after {{knocking}} about as many years as he has been, he ought {{to know what is}} the best thing to be done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{too hot for}} me," [...] he muttered. [...] "I {{guess the}} <b>best</b> thing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is {{to get out of}} this {{neighborhood}} and skip for parts unknown for a while." [...] And then he urged his horse still further to the southward, until the mists in a swamp in the midst of the timber hid him completely from view.|$|R
