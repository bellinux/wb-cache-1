Following the event, a rule was made to limit the length of any option contracts to sixty days, to prevent a similar coup on the short side. After some troubles, Little was again worth $2 million by 1846 (equivalent to about $ million today). However, his fortunes were again reversed that year when he attempted but failed to corner the Norwich and Worcester Railroad and was obligated to pay out for thousands of inflated shares that he had himself <b>bid</b> <b>up</b> in price, losing about {{a million dollars in}} the process—a staggering sum at the time.|$|E

25|$|Sydney trainer Harry Telford persuaded American {{businessman}} David J. Davis to buy {{the colt}} at auction, based on his pedigree. Telford's brother Hugh, who lived in New Zealand, was asked to <b>bid</b> <b>up</b> to 190 guineas at the 1928 Trentham Yearling Sales. When the horse was obtained for a mere 160 guineas, {{he thought it was}} a great bargain until the colt arrived in Australia. The horse was gangly, his face was covered with warts, and he had an awkward gait. Davis was furious when he saw the colt as well, and refused to pay to train the horse. Telford had not been particularly successful as a trainer, and Davis was one of his few remaining owners. To placate Davis, he agreed to train the horse for nothing, in exchange for a two-thirds share of any winnings. Telford leased the horse for three years and was eventually sold joint ownership by Davis.|$|E

2500|$|This is the practice, {{especially}} by high-end art auctioneers, of raising false bids at crucial {{times in the}} bidding {{in order to create}} the appearance of greater demand or to extend bidding momentum for a work on offer. To call out these nonexistent bids auctioneers might fix their gaze at a point in the auction room that is difficult for the audience to pin down. The practice is frowned upon in the industry. In the United States, chandelier bidding is not illegal.

2500|$|Economist Joseph Stiglitz {{argues that}} rather than {{explaining}} concentrations of wealth and income, market forces {{should serve as a}} brake on such concentration, which may better be explained by the non-market force known as [...] "rent-seeking". [...] While the market will <b>bid</b> <b>up</b> compensation for rare and desired skills to reward wealth creation, greater productivity, etc., it will also prevent successful entrepreneurs from earning excess profits by fostering competition to cut prices, profits and large compensation. A better explainer of growing inequality, according to Stiglitz, is the use of political power generated by wealth by certain groups to shape government policies financially beneficial to them. [...] This process, known to economists as rent-seeking, brings income not from creation of wealth but from [...] "grabbing a larger share of the wealth that would otherwise have been produced without their effort" ...|$|E

A [...] "growing body of work" [...] suggests that income inequality has been the driving factor in the growing household debt, as high earners <b>bid</b> <b>up</b> the price of real estate and middle income earners go deeper into debt trying to maintain what once was a middle class lifestyle. Between 1983 and 2007, the top 5 percent saw their debt fall from 80 cents for every dollar of income to 65 cents, while the bottom 95 percent saw their debt rise from 60 cents for every dollar of income to $1.40. Economist Krugman has found a strong correlation between inequality and household debt in the United States over the last hundred years.|$|E
