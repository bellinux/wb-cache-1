To encourage Keller to sign, Krichell met and had dinner with his family. In 1937, Krichell signed shortstop Phil Rizzuto, who had tried out with the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants, but was dismissed by them {{on the grounds that}} he was too small. Even so, Krichell decided to look at the infielder and was impressed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Rizzuto accomplished double plays; his technique reminded Krichell of Leo Durocher, one of his favorite players. He signed Rizzuto for $75 a month and sent him to the Yankees' farm club in Bassett, Virginia.|$|E

5|$|Berryman {{was also}} {{involved}} in the plan's execution, once more becoming chief of staff at New Guinea Force under Blamey in August 1943. Berryman was frustrated at the failure of Vasey's 7th Division to destroy the Japanese retreating from Lae, and personally annoyed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that Vasey forwarded compliments to Major General Ennis Whitehead while leaving any complaints about air support to be taken up by Berryman. Berryman was next involved with the planning for the landing at Finschhafen, brokering a compromise landing plan between Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey and Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring. When Berryman discovered that the United States Seventh Fleet {{did not intend to}} reinforce the 9th Division he immediately went to Blamey, who took the matter up with MacArthur. However, it was Berryman who brokered a compromise deal with Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender to reinforce Finschhafen with a battalion in APDs.|$|E
5|$|For Metal Gear Solid 4, Raiden's {{new design}} was a {{response}} to the criticism that only his face remained in his cybernetic body. Shinkawa, himself, was surprised <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he came to illustrate Raiden. The staff noted that Raiden's debut in the Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer received notably positive responses; several video-game magazines promoted the game with Raiden's screenshots. Kojima echoed similar comments, indicating that he wanted to expand the character with another game. In designning him, Shinkawa wanted to convey both Raiden's beauty as well as sorrow in his cybernetic body. He was also made so that he could wield swords with his own legs giving the players the impressions he was a ninja. Raiden's first fight against Vamp in the game caused difficulty to motion and voice actors because of carefully planned movements performed by the two fighters. The staff was nevertheless satisfied with the outcome, considering it one of the best battles in the game. For the motion capture of Raiden, two actors were selected: one did most of his appearances while another did his action sequences.|$|E

Later that year, five songs provided by Frusciante appeared on The Brown Bunny soundtrack.|$|E

5|$|The Regional Congress of the Syrian Regional Branch, in March 1965, devolved {{power from}} the center, the National Command, to the Regional Command.

Aflaq was unsettled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> things were moving, and in May he convened the Eighth National Congress to get a showdown between his followers and those of the Military Committee. However, this never came to fruition. Several civilian members of the National Command, such as the Lebanese Jibran Majdalani and the Saudi Ali Ghannam, advised caution, believing that if he pressed the Military Committee too hard the military would take over the Syrian Regional Branch, and then the Ba'ath Party—as had happened in Iraq following the ousting of the Iraqi Regional Branch.|$|E
