50|$|Barley {{bread is}} a type of bread made from barley flour derived from the grain of the barley plant. In the British Isles it is a bread which dates back to the Iron Age. Barley flour may not be as {{commonly}} used singly for baking as it once was, but it can be found at health food stores and specialty baking stores, and it is commonly blended (in a smaller proportion) with wheat to make conventional <b>breadmaking</b> <b>flour.</b>|$|E

40|$|To {{establish}} {{its significance}} during commercial breadmaking, dityrosine formation was quantified in flours and doughs of six commercial wheat types {{at various stages}} of the Chorleywood Bread Process. Dityrosine was formed mainly during mixing and baking, at the levels of nmol/g dry weight. Good <b>breadmaking</b> <b>flours</b> tended to exhibit higher dityrosine content in the final bread than low quality ones, but no relationship was found for dityrosine {{as a proportion of}} flour protein content, indicating that the latter was still a dominant factor in the analysis. There was no correlation between gluten yield of the six wheat types and their typical dityrosine concentrations, suggesting that dityrosine crosslinks were not a determinant factor for gluten formation. Ascorbic acid was found to inhibit dityrosine formation during mixing and proving, and have no significant effect on dityrosine in the final bread. Hydrogen peroxide promoted dityrosine formation, which suggests a radical mechanism involving endogenous peroxidases might be the responsible for dityrosine formation during breadmaking...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of cell-wall-degrading enzymes added to temper water on wheat milling performance and flour quality. An enzyme cocktail consisting of cellulase, xylanase, and pectinase and five independent variables (enzyme concentration, incubation time, incubation temperature, tempered wheat moisture content, and tempering water pH) were manipulated in a response surface methodology (RSM) central composite design. A single pure cultivar of hard red winter wheat was tempered under defined conditions and milled on a Ross experimental laboratory mill. Some treatment combinations affected flour yield from the break rolls more than that from the reduction rolls. However, a maximum for flour yield was {{not found in the}} range of parameters studied. Though treatments did not affect the optimum water absorption for <b>breadmaking,</b> enzyme-treated <b>flours</b> produced dough exhibiting shorter mixing times and slack and sticky textures compared with the control. Regardless of differences in mixing times, specific loaf volumes were not significantly different among treatments. Crumb firmness of bread baked with flour milled from enzyme-treated wheat was comparable to the control after 1 day but became firmer during storage up to 5 days...|$|R

The results showed the conformation of proteins varied between flour, hydrated flour, and hydrated gluten. The beta-sheet structure increased progressively from flour to hydrated flour and to hydrated gluten. In hydrated gluten protein fractions comprising gliadin, soluble glutenin, and gel protein, beta-sheet structure increased progressively from soluble gliadin and glutenin to gluten and gel protein; beta-sheet content was also {{greater in the}} gel protein from the <b>breadmaking</b> <b>flour</b> Hereward than the biscuit flour Riband...|$|E

40|$|The {{nicotinamide}} adenine dinucleotide coenzymes [NAD(P) (H) ] {{are strong}} redox agents naturally present in wheat flour, and are indispensable cofactors in many redox reactions. Hence, it is not inconceivable that they affect gluten cross-linking during breadmaking. We investigated the effect of increasing concentrations of NAD(P) (H) on gluten cross-linking, dough properties, and bread volume using two flours of different breadmaking quality. Separate addition of the four nicotinamide coenzymes did not significantly affect mixograph properties. While addition of NAD(+) hardly affected bread volume, supplementation with NADP(H) and NADH significantly decreased loaf volumes of breads made using flour of high breadmaking quality. Wheat flour incubation with NAD(P) H under anaerobic conditions increased wheat flour thiol content. while NAD(P) (+) increased the extractability in SDS-containing medium of the protein of the strong <b>breadmaking</b> <b>flour.</b> Based on the results, {{it was hypothesized that}} at least three reactions, competing for NAD(P) (H), occur during breadmaking that determine the final effect on protein, dough, and loaf properties. Next to coenzyme hydrolysis, the experiments pointed to coenzyme oxidation and NAD(P) (H) dependent redox reactions affecting protein properties. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of the soluble fraction in flour in determining the rheological properties of dough subjected to large deformations and its possible consequence for breadmaking performance was investigated by measuring shear and extensional viscosities of native wheat flour and reconstituted doughs using creep¿recovery tests and lubricated squeezing flow tests. Standard French <b>breadmaking</b> wheat <b>flour</b> was fractionated into water-soluble and insoluble fractions. Flour defatting and puroindoline additions were also tested. The large strain properties of doughs made from these fractions were studied in shear and biaxial extension by creep¿recovery and lubricated squeezing flow tests, respectively. Shear viscosity ¿ exhibited a Newtonian plateau at low shear rate and a shear thinning behaviour at higher in the range 10 ¿ 6 ¿ 1 s¿ 1. Apparent viscosity versus shear rate data could be fitted by Cross model. The results elucidated the lubricating role of the soluble fraction, and were confirmed by the bi-extensional test, although obtained over a narrower strain rate range (), for strain values in the range (0. 1 ¿ 1). The specific volume of bread {{was found to be}} inversely related to bi-extensional viscosity, whereas crumb fineness could be related to the strain hardening index, in agreement with gas retention and bubble growth phenomena during proofing...|$|R

Good quality bread (loaf volume, crumb structure, external appearance) comparable to bread entirely made from wheat flour could be produced {{with a level of}} incorporation of sorghum flour up to 30 /. Beyond this level, the loaf volume decreases and the internal characteristics of crumb are deteriorated. The staling of bread made with composite flour is also influenced by the level of substitution of sorghum flour: the more important this level, the higher the rate of crumb firming. Addition of 0. 5 / emulsiflers, DATEM and SSL, to the sorghum flour blends improves the crumb characteristics and consequently delays the bread firmness...|$|R
40|$|Optimum {{mixing time}} and water {{absorption}} levels of composite wheat flours {{were evaluated by}} response surface methodology. Water absorption was correlated with loaf volume in <b>breadmaking</b> where wheat <b>flour</b> was substituted at 0, 15, or 30 % by wheat starch, cassava starch, or cassava flour. The significance of the mixing time was less clear-cut. Baking {{results showed that the}} reduced breadmaking potential of wheat flour with partial substitution is not solely a function of gluten dilution. Indeed, loaf volume data showed that the breadmaking potential of a substituted wheat flour is determined by the degree of substitution as well as the type of substitute. Clear differentiation of the substitutes occurs during baking, not at the fermentation stage of the dough. Differential scanning calorimetry showed no drastic differences in the gelatinization properties of the doughs made from substituted flours. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Relaxation {{behavior}} was measured for dough, gluten and gluten protein fractions {{obtained from the}} U. K. biscuitmaking flour, Riband, and the U. K. <b>breadmaking</b> <b>flour,</b> Hereward. The relaxation spectrum, in which relaxation times (tau) are related to polymer molecular size, for dough showed a broad molecular size distribution, with two relaxation processes: a major peak at short times and a second peak at times longer than 10 sec, which is thought to correspond to network structure, and which {{may be attributed to}} entanglements and physical cross-links of polymers. Relaxation spectra of glutens were similar to those for the corresponding doughs from both flours. Hereward gluten clearly showed a much more pronounced second peak in relaxation spectrum and higher relaxation modulus than Riband gluten at the same water content. In the gluten protein fractions, gliadin and acetic acid soluble glutenin only showed the first relaxation process, but gel protein clearly showed both the first and second relaxation processes. The results show that the relaxation properties of dough depend on its gluten protein and that gel protein is responsible for the network structure for dough and gluten...|$|E

Baking trials using 2012 and 2013 flour, showed increased loaf volumes and gas bubble diameter in 2013 bread compared to 2012 bread, highlighting the potential impact that surface active polar lipids, enriched in the aqueous phase of dough, could have on improving breadmaking quality...|$|E
40|$|Breadmaking quality (judged by the {{regularity}} of the crumb) of cassava (in cassava flour/defatted soy flour/glyceryl monostearate recipes (80 / 20 / 3, w/w), Cereal Chem 68 323 - 327 1991) {{is related}} to crop age and the season of planting and harvesting. When taking the data sets of the dry season (J Sci Food Agric 66, 193 - 202 1994) and rainy season (ibid 68 167 - 174 1995) together, the following additional interpretation results: breadmaking quality of cassava is positively related to flour from roots with unrestricted growth, and therefore influenced by rainfall distribution, time of planting and harvesting. Variability in baking performance of cassava flour samples {{is related to}} the length and severity of the dry season, the growth behaviour of the genotype and the crop age.

40|$|Wheat kernel {{associated}} endoxylanases {{consist of}} a majority of microbial endoxylanases and a minority of endogenous endoxylanases. At least part of these enzymes can be expected to end up in wheat flour upon milling. In this study, the contribution of both types of these endoxylanases to changes in the arabinoxylan (AX) population during wheat <b>flour</b> <b>breadmaking</b> was assessed. To this end, wheat flour produced from two wheat varieties with different endoxylanase activity levels, both before and after sodium hypochlorite surface treatment of the wheat kernels, was used in a straight dough breadmaking procedure. Monitoring of the AX population during the breadmaking process showed that changes in AX are to a large extent caused by endogenous endoxylanases, whereas the contribution of microbial endoxylanases to these changes was generally very low. The latter points to a limited contamination of wheat flour with microbial enzymes during milling or to an extensive inactivation of these wheat flour associated microbial endoxylanases by endoxylanase inhibitors, present in wheat flour. When all wheat kernel associated microbial endoxylanases were first washed from the kernels and then added to the bread recipe, they drastically affected the AX population, suggesting that they can have a large impact on whole meal breadmaking. status: publishe...|$|R

The results showed that PSSG and some protein-bound related thiol compounds were found in monomeric gliadins, indicating that glutathione and some related thiol compounds are able to form disulphide bonds (SS) with sulphydryl group (SH) of those proteins {{and the formation of}} those disulphide bonds may prevent those monomeric proteins from binding to other proteins. It was also observed that a larger amount of PSSG in glutenin proteins was negatively correlated with the molecular weight (M-w) distribution of glutenin polymers, suggesting that PSSG and protein-bound related thiol compounds may {{play an important role in}} controlling polymerisation of glutenin. Furthermore, it was found that the level of PSSG in gel protein from <b>flours</b> with poor <b>breadmaking</b> performances was constantly higher and significantly different (p < 0. 05) from that of <b>flours</b> with good <b>breadmaking</b> performance.

40|$|Protein-lipid {{interactions}} in dough {{have an important}} impact {{on the quality of}} bakery products. Understanding of protein-lipid {{interactions in}} gluten can enhance the development of technological solutions to improve the <b>breadmaking</b> quality of <b>flour</b> as well as the functional properties of gluten. In this study, acetic acid at two different concentrations was used for treating and fractionating gluten. The impact of these procedures on the distribution of lipid components was measured. Acetic acid was able to dissociate non-polar lipids from the gluten protein matrix. Upon fractionation monomeric proteins (predominantly gliadins) and phospholipids were high in the 0. 01 M acetic acid soluble fraction. The subsequent fractionation step using 0. 1 M acetic acid resulted in an increased amount of high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) in the soluble fraction, along with more non-polar lipids and glycolipids in both the free and bound lipid extracts. The distribution of lipid classes demonstrates that non-polar lipids are either associated with the glutenin polymeric network through hydrophobic interactions or entrapped within the gluten matrix. The results also indicate that in gluten, glycolipids are likely to be associated with glutenins through both hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds whilst phospholipids preferentially interact with gliadins and lipid binding proteins...|$|R

In addition, the activity rate of lipoxygenase (LOX) and peroxidase (POD) enzymes implicated in the antioxidant metabolism was determined. Albumins and globulins in wheat grains were characterized by rich protein pattern - the number of bands varied from 19 to 23 and they were defined by molecular weight 76. 4 - 12. 4 kDa. The great differences between bread and durum wheat polypeptide contents were found. Result pointed out that polypeptides with molecular weight of 65. 6, 43. 5 and 32. 9 kDa could be used to differentiate the bread from durum wheat. Significant differences in the LOX and POD activity between and within two wheat species were detected.

40|$|Producción CientíficaCereal β-glucan {{concentrates}} {{can be used}} in gluten-free breads {{to improve}} dough handling properties and quality of final products as well as to enhance their nutritional value; however, the presence of endogenous β-glucanases in rice flour, in combination with prolonged mixing, fermentation and proofing time, can cause a substantial reduction in β-glucan molecular weight, affecting detrimentally their efficacy for bioactivity. In this study, microwave (MIWA) heating was applied to the rice <b>flours</b> before <b>breadmaking</b> at different <b>flour</b> water contents (13 - 25 %) and treatment times (0 - 4 min) to reduce β-glucanase activity. Gluten-free breads made from the MIWA treated rice flours were fortified with oat β-glucan concentrate to enhance their nutritional profile. The molecular weight of added β-glucan in the final products increased with increasing both flour water content and time of MIWA treatment, reflecting the magnitude of residual β-glucanase activity in the flour. Pretreatment with MIWA radiation for 4 min of the rice flour tempered at 25 % moisture resulted in negligible residual β-glucanase activity and preserved to a great extent the molecular weight of β-glucans in the enriched breads. End-product quality was not affected by flour MIWA pretreatment, and even a slightly higher loaf specific volume was noted for breads made from the MIWA -treated flours (4 min MIWA at 25 % moisture content) compared to that of untreated flour. These findings can contribute to the improvement of nutritional value of rice-based gluten-free breads for celiac consumers as well as of any β-glucan containing yeast-leavened bakery product without altering its sensorial attributes. Additional studies are still required for further evaluation of the effect of more intense microwave treatment on rice flour and its application on breadmaking...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryJon FaubionWhole {{wheat flour}} {{has become a}} popular {{ingredient}} in baked goods. Consumers are seeking the added benefits of consuming healthy phytochemicals and bioactive compounds. As the demand for wholemeal flour increases {{it is important to}} understand the factors contributing to changes in whole wheat <b>flour</b> <b>breadmaking</b> quality as a function of both wheat and flour age. In wholemeal flour, the lipid composition appears to be a factor causing variable baking quality. Changes that occur in both freshly harvested wheat and milled flour can cause variations in baking quality. Bakers’ attempts to adjust formulations and processes are often unsuccessful. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of aging both new crop wheat and freshly milled flour at 2 different temperatures on baking quality and glycolipid composition. This study aged freshly harvested Overley hard red winter wheat at RT (23 ˚C) and FZ (- 26 ˚C) for 8, 50, and 91 days before milling. Whole wheat flour baking and lipid extraction studies were performed incrementally over 31 days of flour storage after each milling. Glycolipid structure and amounts were measured using automated electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. The glycolipids analyzed in this study were DGDG (digalactosyldiglycerol), MGDG (monogalactosylmonoglycerol), MGMG (monogalactosylmonoglycerol), and DGMG (digalactosylmonoglycerol). Both the wheat and flour stored at - 26 ˚C produced larger mean loaf volumes than did the 23 ˚C treatment for all 3 wheat ages. The FZ and RT DGDG:MGDG ratios were similar over both wheat and flour age so changes to the glycolipid fraction did not appear to be the cause of the significant difference between volumes of bread baked from samples stored at RT and FZ. There was limited change in mean volume over flour age except for an increase at the FZ 91 day point. The DGDG:MGDG ratios were generally unchanged over flour age. Loaf volumes were the same over wheat age except for an unexpected drop during the 50 day wheat study. The corresponding DGDG:MGDG ratios did not show any significant differences over wheat age. The FZ storage temperature might be inhibiting some biochemical change not affecting the glycolipids, leading to higher volumes than the RT storage treatment...|$|R
40|$|Tyrosinases and laccases are copper-containing oxidoreductases, which {{catalyze}} oxidation {{of various}} mono- and polyphenolic compounds. Tyrosinases oxidize p-monophenols and o-diphenols to quinones, whereas laccases {{are capable of}} oxidizing a larger variety of aromatic compounds, such as substituted mono- and polyphenols, aromatic amines and thiol compounds, with subsequent production of radicals. Both tyrosinase and laccase generate reaction products which are prone to react further non-enzymatically, which may lead to polymerization. In addition to the low molecular mass phenolic compounds, the phenolic moieties present in certain biopolymers are susceptible to oxidation by tyrosinase and laccase, which enables crosslinking of the biopolymers. The biochemical properties of a novel fungal tyrosinase from Trichoderma reesei (TrT) were characterized in this work. The substrate specificity and protein crosslinking ability of TrT were compared to other tyrosinases of plant and fungal origin. Furthermore, the suitability of TrT and laccase from Trametes hirsuta (ThL) was examined for hetero-crosslinking of carbohydrates and proteins and for improving wheat breadmaking quality. TrT was over-expressed in its original host under a strong cbh 1 promoter and purified with a three step purification procedure, consisting of desalting by gel filtration, and cation exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The purified TrT showed a molecular weight of 43. 2  kDa as analyzed by mass spectrometry. TrT {{was found to be}} processed from the C-terminus by cleavage of a peptide fragment of about 20  kDa. TrT was active both on L-tyrosine and L-dopa, thus showing typical characteristics of a true tyrosinase. TrT had broad substrate specificity, and the enzyme showed the highest activity and stability in the neutral and alkaline pH range, with an optimum at pH  9. TrT retained its activity relatively well at temperatures of 40  °C and below. When tyrosinases from apple (AT), potato (PT), the white rot fungus Pycnoporus sanguineus (PsT) and the edible mushroom Agaricus bisporus (AbT) were compared to TrT, {{it was found that the}} tyrosinases had clearly different features in terms of substrate specificity, inhibition and their ability to crosslink the model protein α-casein. Generally the tyrosinases had lower activity on monophenols than on di- or triphenols. PsT had the highest monophenolase/diphenolase ratio for the oxidation of monophenolic L-tyrosine and diphenolic L-dopa. However, TrT had the highest activity on most of the tested monophenols, and showed clearly shorter lag periods prior to the oxidation of the monophenols than the other enzymes. The activity of AT and PT on tyrosine was undetectable which explains the poor crosslinking ability of α-casein by these enzymes. AbT was also unable to crosslink α-casein, although it could oxidize tyrosine of di- and tri-peptides. Conversely, the activity of PsT on the model peptides turned out to be relatively low, although the enzyme could crosslink α-casein. Of the analyzed tyrosinases, TrT clearly had the best ability to directly crosslink α-casein. However, by after addition of a small molecular weight phenolic compound, L-dopa, to the reaction mixture, the other tyrosinases were also able to crosslink α-casein. It is assumed that L-dopa acted as a bridging compound between the α-casein subunits. The capability of the two different fungal oxidative enzymes, the TrT tyrosinase and the ThL laccase, to catalyze formation of hetero-conjugates between tyrosine side-chains of α-casein and phenolic acids of hydrolyzed oat spelt xylan (hOSX) was studied. TrT was able to crosslink α-casein more efficiently than ThL, whereas only ThL was able to polymerize hOSX. The radical- and quinone-mediated protein crosslinking clearly differed, which was indicated by enhancement of crosslinking by the presence of phenolic acids with ThL, and by inhibition with TrT. Despite the notable differences between the oxidative enzymes in their ability to crosslink the biopolymers, both ThL and TrT were observed to be able to catalyze oxidative hetero-crosslinking of α-casein and xylan. The effects of TrT and ThL were also compared in wheat <b>flour</b> <b>breadmaking.</b> The enzymes were found to act in wheat dough and bread via different crosslinking mechanisms. Both ThL and TrT improved the bread quality, especially when used in combination with xylanase, as indicated by an increase in bread volume and bread crumb softness during storage. The effect of ThL is assumed to be based mainly on the crosslinking of ferulic acid -substituted arabinoxylan with subsequent arabinoxylan network formation, and thus indirectly also strengthening the gluten network of dough. ThL may also have directly oxidized the tyrosyl residues of gluten proteins or enhanced the disulphide bridge formation in gluten polymers via ferulic acid-derived radicals, thus assisting protein aggregation in dough. The effects of TrT in dough and bread are suggested to be due mainly to polymerization of gluten proteins via production of reactive quinones by oxidation of the protein-bound tyrosine residues with consequent formation of crosslinks in the gluten proteins. Tyrosinase may also have influenced the texture properties of dough and bread by oxidizing other phenolic compounds as well as tyrosine of wheat flour, such as p-coumaric and caffeic acids. The oxidative enzymes, tyrosinase and laccase, were shown to have potential in crosslinking of food biopolymers. The T. reesei tyrosinase was found to be an efficient protein crosslinker, especially when compared to the T. hirsuta laccase or to the tyrosinases of plant and fungal origin. On the other hand, ThL was observed to be more efficient in catalyzing the formation of hetero-crosslinks between proteins and carbohydrates, as compared to TrT. It was shown in this work that both types of oxidative enzymes, tyrosinase and laccase, can be applied to generate food biopolymers with added functionalities or novel food structures from diverse raw materials.

T. reesei -tyrosinaasi tuotettiin ylituottomenetelmällä alkuperäisessä tuottoisännässään. Entsyymi puhdistettiin kolmivaiheisella kromatografisella prosessilla. T. reesei -tyrosinaasin molekyylipainoksi määritettiin 43, 2  kDa, ja polypeptidin C-terminaalisesta päästä todetiiin katkenneen noin 20  kDa -kokoinen peptidi. T. reesei -tyrosinaasi oli aktiivinen neutraalilla ja emäksisellä pH-alueella. Verrattaessa T. reesei -tyrosinaasia omenasta, perunasta, Pycnoporus sanguineus sekä Agaricus bisporus -homeista peräisin oleviin tyrosinaaseihin havaittiin entsyymeiden substraattispesifisyyden ja kyvyn ristisilloittaa maitoproteiinia eroavan toisistaan huomattavasti. T. reesei -tyrosinaasi hapetti monofenolisia yhdisteitä ja ristisilloitti kaseiinia selvästi tehokkaimmin. Myös P. sanguineus -tyrosinaasi kykeni polymeroimaan kaseiinia. Kun reaktioseokseen lisättiin pienimolekyylipainoista di-fenolia, kaikki tyrosinaasit kykenivät ristisilloittamaan kaseiinia. T. reesei -tyrosinaasia ja T. hirsuta -lakkaasia verrattiin suhteessa niiden kykyyn katalysoida polymerointireaktioita α-kaseiinin ja ksylaanin fenolisten sivuryhmien kautta. Tyrosinaasi kykeni polymeroimaan α-kaseiinia lakkaasia paremmin. Toisaalta lakkaasi kykeni polymeroimaan ksylaania, mutta tyrosinaasi ei. Huolimatta havaituista eroista sekä lakkaasin että tyrosinaasin osoitettiin muodostavan heteroristisidoksia maitoproteiinin ja ksylaanin välillä. Vehnäleivonnassa molemmat entsyymit lisäsivät leivän ominaistilavuutta sekä pehmeyttä. Lakkaasin vaikutus johtui ilmeisesti pääosin vehnän arabinoksylaanin ristisiloittumisesta ja tyrosinaasin gluteeniproteiinien ristisilloitumisesta. Saavutettujen tulosten perusteella voidaan todeta, että T. reesei -tyrosinaasi ja T. hirsuta -lakkaasi soveltuvat elintarvikkeiden rakenne- ja funktionaalisten ominaisuuksien muokkaamiseen. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{preparation}} of staple foods in African countries {{is still a}} very time-consuming job. This is particularly the case in sub-Saharan countries where millet and sorghum form the basic diet and where most grain is processed by hand. As a result of expanding urban populations and higher demand for leavened bread and fast foods, wheat requirements have increased considerably in developing countries. In order to promote the use of local grains, the FAO established the Composite Flour Programme in 1964 and started implementation in 1970 by developing methods and products for commercial production in Senegal. Leavened bread made from wheat flour has been used in the Mediterranean for at least three thousand vears. This staple subsequently spread all over the world. The fascination for Western food encouraged the habit of bread consumption in most of the large cities in developing countries. Over the last few decades wheat flour and the American loaf of bread have become familiar products on markets of all continents. Those developing countries influenced by French culture, however, have shown more interest in the consumption of the French 'baguette'. In many developing countries bread is now part of the daily diet of most urban households. Breadmaking has been widely introduced in several African countries. In Kenya, for example, bread consumption has been increasing by 15 % per year since 1978. In some parts of Zaire notably around Kinshasa, bread has virtually replaced the traditional starchy staple 'shikwanga' derived from locally-grown cassava. The popularity of bread encouraged women in several countries to organize baking cooperatives. These efforts were not only in order to produce bread locally but also for making a little extra income. Many of these initiatives have come up against serious problems such as high costs of both transporting flour and fuel for firing the poorly designed ovens. It is true that bread has several advantages over traditional staple foods. It requires no further preparation once purchased and it can be kept for several days in a range of environmental conditions. Moreover, the nutritional value of bread is higher than that of other staple foods such as cassava, rice or potatoes. Nevertheless, bread remains a luxury as far as developing countries are concerned, given the fact that wheat imports and their subsidies are a major drain on local budgets. Wheat accounts for nearly three quarters of all grain imported by African countries. Almost all of Zaire's country's wheat is imported from the American mid-west. For climatic reasons, wheat suitable for breadmaking can be grown in very few countries in tropical areas. Wheat substitutes could be a solution to these problems but many difficulties are encountered in making bread with non-wheat materials. The secret of bread making The main problem is that non-wheat materials do not possess glutenforming protein which, through kneading, gives bread its unique texture and flavour. Only two cereals, wheat and rye, contain this extensible protein. For breadmaking, one requires a flour from a wheat of fairly high gluten content. When the dough is mixed, and subsequently fermented, the protein chains produce a lattice network which holds the carbon dioxide gas released during fermentation. During baking, the carbon dioxide is driven off leaving behind the open crumb texture of leavened bread Making bread by substituting part of the wheat, rather than all of it is not new. The {{preparation of}} such composite flours, however, generally demands a more complex processing. Non-wheat materials require dry extraction milling to remove fibre and fat. In times of scarcity, non-wheat materials were generally used to extend bread supplies. In ancient times, barley was frequently added and bread containing a large amount of barley flour was often the staple food of the poor. The use of flour from barley, potatoes, rye and maize occurred throughout the two World Wars. It {{is important to note that}} these additives were crops grown in temperate regions. It is known that tropical and subtropical cereals. tuber and root starches have often been added to wheat flour but, unfortunately, there are very few reports about these experiences. More recently, the use of composite flour has become fashionable in the West. This has perhaps helped in reconsidering breadmaking with blends of wheat and non-wheat materials of tropical origin. International efforts for local bread Gluten-free flour has long been used for the preparation of dietetic bread types, especially for patients suffering from coeliac diseases. Going even further, the Dutch Institute for Grain, Flour and Bread Research (TNO), in Wageningen, developed bread made entirely made from non-wheat material. The FAO Composite Flour Programme was designed to effect savings in foreign exchange by reducing wheat imports. Following this initiative, several programmes at the national level have been set up. At the Food Technology Institute (Institut de Technologie Alimentaire, ITA), Dakar, a project was established in 1970 to develop processing techniques for the commercialization of millet products. A similar experience started in Sudan in the late 1970 's, with special emphasis on the use of sorghum. The volume of a loaf of bread made with millet flour is generally smaller than that of genuine wheat flour loaf. At the end of the ITA project in Dakar, around 1974, millet bread was produced daily for sale and a commercial bakery was opened. An original method for making French type millet bread, using 30 % millet flour and 70 % wheat flour, was developed by experimental research on the use of millet flour. In 1979 Senegal made it obligatory to use 15 % millet flour and 85 % wheat flour in bread baked in Dakar and the Cape Verde region. By the end of 1982 two commercial mills in Dakar were equipped for millet milling with a capacity of approximately 100 tonnes per day. They produce millet/ wheat flour mixtures following the official requirements for breadmaking Based on the experience in Senegal, a project was launched at the Food Research Centre (FRC) in Khartoum, Sudan, including a sorghum milling and bakery pilot plant. It is interesting to note that another project has been started this year in Burkina Faso to mix wheat with 5 % of maize flour. Insofar as the FRC Sudan project is concerned, a survey showed that bread made with 30 % sorghum flour and 70 % wheat flour was evaluated as palatable to excellent. As with millet bread, the volume of a sorghum loaf remains small and the texture is drier and less elastic. However, it can be kept longer than bread made out of wheat alone. Neither the texture nor the flavour are much affected by the addition of sorghum flour. The capacity of the pilot bakery could reach a maximum of about 15, 000 loaves per 24 hours (3, 000 kg of flour per day). The distribution of the bread made with up to 25 % sorghum flour was limited to selected clients. Disadvantages of composite flour processing Bread made from composite flour containing low protein materials will require enrichment. Cottonseed flour, fish meal, groundnut and cowpeas are among the products that can be used as protein supplements. Such concentrates should be free from materials which might spoil the flavour, volume and texture of the bread. They should also be free from harmful substances such as gossypol in cottonseed and trypsin inhibitor in soya. Composite flours can also be used for other diverse food commodities. A large percentage of local grains (up to 50 %) can be used in the manufacturing of biscuits and noodles. Non-wheat flours have different milling characteristics. Sorghum and millet flours, for example, have a higher ash and fat content in fine fractions than in coarse fractions, contrary to wheat. The outer layers should be removed by decortication before grinding the endosperm to flour. In Senegal, millet is always decorticated before it is milled. Many consumers dislike the product made by mechanical decortication, so most of the millet in Senegal is decorticated and ground by hand. Specific studies on millet decortication show that dry milling techniques increase the yield by 10 - 20 % compared with traditional pounding; they lighten the workload and also improve flour quality. In Sudan, decorticating sorghum is less cumbersome and in towns most sorghum is ground in stone mills without decortication to produce 100 % extraction flours. A fluffy bread texture is difficult to obtain with local cereals. Many years of research have been devoted to this subject, e. g., by the TDRI (Tropical Development and Research Institute) in London, the IDRC (International Development Research Centre) in Canada, by several research institutes in France and by two Belgian universities, the Catholic University of Louvain and the University of Leuven. The latter developed a leavening agent, utilizing pentosan (a rye extract) that raises the dough. Nevertheless, the loaves are still quite different in form from wheat products and also have Inwer nutrient value. Not all sorghum varieties can be used with success in industrial processing. Many popular varieties generally used for traditional dishes are not suitable for mechanical processing due to their softness and the difficulties encountered in separating the bran. The softness of the grain is probably the most important criterion. The consumer prefers a white color and fine flour irrespective of the variety from which it is produced. For efficient production, quality control is essential in purchasing sorghum suitable for milling. White varieties are often mixed with small amounts of coloured kernels, which diminish considerably the quality of the flour. Today deliveries with an impurity rate exceeding 3 % are no longer accepted. New products Traditionally, millet and sorghum are primarily eaten with vegetables and a meat sauce in the form of millet couscous or porridge in several northern and western African countries; sorghum ugi in Kenya or kisra in Sudan. In Sudan, four sorghum mills with a capacity of 150 tonnes per day are producing commodities for traditional dishes. Sorghum flours are more appropriate for producing biscuits and other commodities where the volume is not of prime importance. Snack foods, such as chips, have been developed at the FRC and it was found that they have a good market potential. Research on foodstuffs sometimes lead to new products. Pearl aura is a new polished sorghum product developed at the FRC. It is an attractive ready-to-use cereal, similar to rice, and costs approximately one third as much as rice for the Sudanese consumer. Furthermore, it has a white colour and a good taste. The only disadvantages are the fact that pearl aura requires more water and a longer cooking time than rice. The nutritive value has been estimated to be about the same as rice. Marketing tests suggest that this product may have a promising future. Another example of the use of local varieties for commercial food manufacturing is a project on weaning foods in Benin. Baby food flours which are manufactured in Ouando are made out of locally grown maize, sorghum and soya. Only rice is imported for some products in this project. This semi-industrial manufacturing plant can even be operated manually. The marketing is organized by small traders and the products have been readily accepted by families. Efforts for the future After thirty years of research and development on breadmaking and the use of non-wheat flour compounds, it has become clear that these programmes have not led to concrete results. This is perhaps why projects are now more oriented towards commercial processing of traditional dishes which utilize local grain types. Food emergencies, particularly those involving large numbers of refugees, have become increasingly frequent in recent years. Doubts are still expressed about the impact of food aid, especially its possible detrimental effects on production in the recipient country, its failure to reach the most needy and its influence on food eating habits. The European consumption pattern has also been given too much attention. While focussing research mainly on technical constraints and problems, cultural and economic aspects have been overlooked. Pilot projects conceived to cover demands at national levels were often set-up on too large a scale requiring considerable amounts of local grain necessitating a steady production and reliable quality. Moreover, imported commodities are available at anytime and subsidies make their purchase less expensive. It is cheaper and easier to feed bread to a growing and influential urban population than to increase agricultural production in the countryside and improve transportation and distribution systems. It has to be acknowledged that most of the composite <b>flour</b> <b>breadmaking</b> projects in Africa did not succeed. A report on this subject published by the FAO in 1982 states that :None of these projects actually succeeded in applying large scale flour processing plants over the long term. Most of these research operations did not get beyond the laboratories or pilot installations. The main target of all these efforts was primarily the making of bread. More work is now needed on local dishes and the commercial processing and distribution of ready-to-use traditional food commodities. The first steps in this direction have already been taken in Togo with the support of the French CEEMAT (Study and Experimentation Centre for Agricultural Mechanization) on ready-to-use gari made from cassava. Marketing efforts have already proved successful. If 40 % of the population of sub-Saharan countries alone will be living in urban areas towards the year 2000, precooked traditional food may become very useful.
