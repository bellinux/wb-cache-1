5|$|Macromolecules such as starch, {{cellulose}} or proteins {{cannot be}} rapidly {{taken up by}} cells and must be broken into their smaller units <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used in cell metabolism. Several common classes of enzymes digest these polymers. These digestive enzymes include proteases that digest proteins into amino acids, as well as glycoside hydrolases that digest polysaccharides into simple sugars known as monosaccharides.|$|E
5|$|A {{procedure}} {{for dealing with}} omitted decompression stops is described in the US Navy Diving Manual. In principle the procedure allows a diver who is not yet presenting symptoms of decompression sickness, to go back down and complete the omitted decompression, with some extra added {{to deal with the}} bubbles which are assumed to have formed during the period where the decompression ceiling was violated. Divers who become symptomatic <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> returned to depth are treated for decompression sickness, and do not attempt the omitted decompression procedure as the risk is considered unacceptable under normal operational circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Knight {{introduces}} enemy medics who can shield {{enemies in}} electrified fields and revive unconscious ones, sword-wielding enemies, and brutes who {{are resistant to}} damage and must be stunned <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> attacked; brutes wielding Gatling guns, tasers, and blades require additional steps to defeat. Enemies are capable of employing tactics to counter Batman's various skills, including deploying landmines, controlling hovering drones, disabling vents if Batman is found using them, and detecting his location if Batman uses Detective Vision for too long.|$|E

50|$|Unfortunately the {{destruction}} of the Amazon Rainforest is driving many insect species to extinction <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> even <b>be</b> identified or seen by man. Each day dozens are going extinct because many species only live on a few acres range.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to visual warnings, ambulances can be fitted with audible warnings, sometimes known as sirens, which can alert people and vehicles {{to the presence}} of an ambulance <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen. The first audible warnings were mechanical bells, mounted to either the front or roof of the ambulance. Most modern ambulances are now fitted with electronic sirens, producing a range of different noises which ambulance operators can use to attract more attention to themselves, particularly when proceeding through an intersection or in heavy traffic.|$|E
5|$|Rarely cultivated, Banksia ilicifolia {{requires}} a sunny position and sandy well-drained soil to do well. A slow-growing plant, it takes {{up to ten}} years to flower from seed. The glossy green foliage and long flowering period, combined with prominently displayed flowers give it horticultural potential, although its prickly foliage makes fallen leaves a problem if planted near lawns or walkways. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 22 to 41 days to germinate. Difficulties in collection and low seed set make seed relatively expensive. Seeds are often eaten by insects <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> collected.|$|E
5|$|The second {{operation}} {{takes them}} to Russia in order to rescue one of their allies, a Russian informant named Nikolai working within the Ultranationalist party. Assisted by Russian Loyalist forces, Price's team succeeds in rescuing Nikolai. However, their helicopter is later brought down, forcing the group {{to make their way}} through enemy territory with support from an AC-130 gunship <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> extracted. Intelligence gathered from these two missions indicates that Al-Asad may be in possession of a Russian nuclear device.|$|E
50|$|The {{degree of}} {{treatment}} required for excreta-based fertilizers <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> safely <b>be</b> used in agriculture {{depends on a}} number of factors. It mainly depends on which other barriers will be put in place according to the multiple barrier concept. Such barriers might be selecting a suitable crop, farming methods, methods of applying the fertilizer, education and so forth.|$|R
5000|$|Cavity {{retains the}} single bat and ball of Breakout, but two other balls are {{enclosed}} {{on the other}} side of the wall, which the player must free <b>before</b> <b>they,</b> too, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to destroy additional bricks. Points are increased for this, but triple points are available if the player can keep all three balls in play.|$|R
50|$|Two cereal salesmen, Osamu and Jay, {{are driving}} along {{when they come}} upon an {{accident}} scene. They are ordered by Air Force to flee, but <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> attacked by vampiric creatures. Osamu is blown into a trailer where he finds a beautiful, green-haired androgynous-looking figure, Kimera, inside a cryogenic container. A silver bell he recently purchased and wears around his neck rings, waking the creature inside who kisses him through the glass. Two of the vampiric creatures arrive, with a long ebony-haired male vampire attacking Osamu, and a disfigured one defending him. They disappear, and Osamu and Jay are taken to the Air Force base. They are released as Jay's father, Dr. Gibson, is on the research team there.|$|R
5|$|Fossils of organisms' {{bodies are}} usually the most {{informative}} type of evidence. The most common types are wood, bones, and shells. Fossilisation is a rare event, and most fossils are destroyed by erosion or metamorphism <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> observed. Hence the fossil record is very incomplete, increasingly so further back in time. Despite this, it is often adequate to illustrate the broader patterns of life's history. There are also biases in the fossil record: different environments are more favorable {{to the preservation of}} different types of organism or parts of organisms. Further, only the parts of organisms that were already mineralised are usually preserved, such as the shells of molluscs. Since most animal species are soft-bodied, they decay before they can become fossilised. As a result, although there are 30-plus phyla of living animals, two-thirds have never been found as fossils.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo 64 {{video game}} console has {{a library of}} games, which were {{primarily}} released in plastic ROM cartridges. Two small indentations {{on the back of}} each cartridge allows it to connect or pass through the system's cartridge dustcover flaps. All regions have the same connectors, and region-locked cartridges will fit into the other regions' systems by using a cartridge converter or by simply removing the cartridge's casing. However, the systems are also equipped with lockout chips that will only allow them to play their appropriate games. Both Japanese and North American systems have the same NTSC lockout, while Europe has a PAL lockout. A bypass device such as the N64 Passport or the Datel Action Replay can be used to play import titles, but a few games require an additional boot code <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> played.|$|E
5|$|Each of the {{branches}} of the ADF has a reserve component. These forces are the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, Australian Army Reserve and Royal Australian Air Force Reserve. The main role of the reserves is to supplement the permanent elements of the ADF during deployments and crises, including natural disasters. This can include attaching individual reservists to regular units or deploying units composed entirely of reserve personnel. As reservists serve on a part-time basis, they are less costly to the government than permanent members of the ADF, but the nature of their service can mean that reservists have a lower level of readiness than regular personnel and require further training <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> deployed. It has historically proven difficult to set a level of training requirements which allows reservists to be rapidly deployable yet does not act as a disincentive to recruitment and continued participation.|$|E
5000|$|... "Electrical insect killers", which {{attract and}} kill the adult beetles <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> breed, may <b>be</b> used {{alongside}} conventional chemical treatments {{with the intention of}} killing the adult beetles <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> breed, but the effectiveness of such an approach is not known.|$|R

40|$|Preparing {{students}} for language and cultural exchanges abroad <b>can</b> <b>be</b> difficult; all too often, little preparation {{is done for}} Japanese students <b>before</b> <b>they</b> go. This paper will discuss how students at Kyushu Institute of Technology (KIT) are prepared for language study at an American university. In short, KIT has found that preparing students <b>before</b> <b>they</b> go <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{as important as the}} trip itself...|$|R
5|$|Professor Layton and the Last Specter is {{a puzzle}} game {{presented}} {{in the style of}} an adventure game. The player controls the actions of a group of three protagonists as they move about a village called Misthallery: Professor Hershel Layton, his assistant Emmy Altava, and a young boy named Luke Triton. While in the village, the three of them are presented with several mysteries that are solved as the plot progresses. Misthallery is divided into several sections, although many require the plot to progress to a certain point <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> accessed. In order to move about Misthallery, players tap a shoe-shaped icon on the bottom-right corner of the touch screen, and then the arrow representing the direction of the path they wish to take. While in Misthallery, the player is capable of tapping anywhere on the bottom screen of the Nintendo DS system to investigate objects and reveal bits of dialogue, hint coins, collectible items, or hidden puzzles. Likewise, if a non-player character is visible on the screen, they can be tapped to initiate a conversation.|$|E
5|$|The outpost is {{evacuated}} {{during the}} dangerous mission, {{leaving only the}} Enterprise away team on surface. The firestorms overwhelm the position that Daren's team occupies <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> retrieved. Believing Daren to be dead, Picard sits contemplating his decision in his quarters. He then hears that survivors are being transported aboard, and heads to the transporter room. Daren is not among the initial group of survivors, but is later transported to the ship. Eight {{members of the team}} have died. Afterwards, Picard and Daren discuss their relationship. They conclude that it cannot continue, as Picard could not bear to put her in danger once more. They discuss giving up their Starfleet careers to be together. Daren realizes that Picard, still cherishing the family life he experienced as Kamin, has nonetheless chosen duty, career, and loneliness. They both know that Daren must transfer off the Enterprise. They kiss once more, and Daren makes Picard promise not to give up music.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie {{visit the}} local Quahog bank so that Brian can deposit holiday {{money in his}} safe deposit box. Stewie then {{wants to go to}} a store to return a $3,000 Thom Browne sweater. While they are still inside the vault, the door closes {{at the end of the}} work day and locks them inside until the next morning. Frightened, Stewie soils his diaper. Worried he will get a rash from the dirty diaper, Stewie desperately tries to make Brian eat his feces by {{threatening}} him with a gun that Brian had stored in his deposit box. They discover that Stewie has a cellphone in his pocket, but there's only enough charge in the battery for one short phone call. Unfortunately, Stewie uses the last of the phone's battery charge to call the clothing store rather than for help. Enraged, Brian hits Stewie, throws his phone on the ground (thus breaking the phone), and yells at Stewie, making him cry. Instantly remorseful and wanting to repair his relationship with Stewie, Brian reluctantly agrees to eat Stewie's feces in order to provide him with a clean diaper and make up for making Stewie cry. While watching Brian eating, Stewie becomes nauseated and throws up; Stewie then convinces Brian to eat his puke, correctly pointing out that Brian likes the taste of vomit. Realizing that he has nothing to clean his bottom with, Stewie manages to convince Brian to clean his bottom with his tongue in order to avoid infection, much to Stewie's pleasure. Afterward, they both decide to take a nap, but soon they realize that the next day is Sunday, meaning that they will have to wait another day <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> released from the vault.|$|E
50|$|Code {{is created}} by {{dragging}} blocks into a coding area and snapping them together. All the blocks are completely icon-based (no text) which <b>is</b> how children <b>can</b> use this language <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> read. Blocks <b>are</b> connected from left to right, like words.|$|R
50|$|Out at sea, the Nazi subs {{prepare to}} decimate the Allied fleet. <b>Before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> attack, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> bombed by a {{squadron}} of Allied B-26 bombers sent in response to Lois' warnings. The subs are destroyed, and the Allied fleet is saved.|$|R
40|$|The {{conflict}} {{is clear and}} the stakes are high. The effect of the rule below will be to grant drunk drivers one free swerve <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> legally <b>be</b> pulled over by police. It {{will be difficult for}} an officer to explain to the family of a motorist killed by that swerve that the police had a tip that the driver of the other car was drunk, but that they were powerless to pull him over, even for a quick check...|$|R
5|$|The Quarter Pony is {{recognized}} by several different breed registries that each have different requirements. The American Quarter Pony Association requires that, although parentage may be unknown, the pony must have conformation that is desirable for breeding and be easily recognizable as having Quarter Pony or Quarter Horse breeding. pinto, leopard complex (Appaloosa), and white horses {{are not eligible}} for registration, nor are gaited ponies. The National Quarter Pony Association requires that stallions be registered with the AQHA <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> registered with the NQPA. Mares must have one parent registered with the AQHA, be registered with the AQHA themselves, or go through a special registration process. Geldings simply have to be of Quarter Horse type to be eligible for registration. Horses with Pinto or Appaloosa markings, or with excessive white, {{are not eligible for}} registration. The International Quarter Pony Association allows Pinto and Appaloosa markings, and simply requires that ponies be of Quarter-type conformation and good disposition for registry. Any type of pony meeting these requirements may be registered through the hardship registration program, which includes a special inspection. However, if ponies have a parent registered with an approved breed registry (approved breeds include the Quarter Pony, Quarter Horse, Paint horse, Appaloosa and Pony of the Americas), they are automatically eligible for registration, with no inspection required. Crosses with gaited breeds are not accepted for registration.|$|E
25|$|The Student coaches, {{much like}} the riders must fulfill certain {{requirements}} <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> eligible.|$|E
25|$|Prior approval: Insurers propose rates, {{which must}} be {{reviewed}} formally and approved explicitly or deemed approved by the regulatory body <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> charged.|$|E
50|$|Specifications must {{be subject}} to a process of {{refinement}} (the filling-in of implementation detail) <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> actually <b>be</b> implemented. The result of such a refinement process is an executable algorithm, which is either formulated in a programming language, or in an executable subset of the specification language at hand. For example, Hartmann pipelines, whenproperly applied, may be considered a dataflow specification which is directly executable. Another example is the Actor model which has no specific application content and must be specialized to be executable.|$|R
50|$|Clinical {{trials are}} known {{to be one of the}} most {{valuable}} sources of data in evidence-based medicine. For a pharmaceutical, device, or procedure to be approved for regular use in the U.S., it must be rigorously tested in clinical trials, and demonstrate sufficient efficacy. Unfortunately clinical trials are also extremely expensive and time consuming. End-points, such as morbidity and mortality, are used as measures to compare groups within a clinical trial. The most basic endpoint used in clinical trials, mortality, requires years and sometimes decades of follow-up to sufficiently assess. Morbidity, although potentially faster to measure than mortality, <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> a very difficult endpoint to measure clinically, as it is often very subjective. These are some of the reasons why biomarkers have been increasingly used in clinical trials to detect subtle changes in physiology and pathology <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>are</b> detected clinically. The biomarkers act as surrogate endpoints. The use of surrogate endpoints has been shown to significantly decrease the time and resources used in clinical trials. Because surrogate end-points allow researchers to assess a marker rather than the patient, it allows participants to act as their own control, and in many cases allows for easier blinding.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{composition}} of a sausage roll is sheets of puff pastry formed into tubes around sausage meat and glazed with egg or milk <b>before</b> being baked. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> served either hot or cold.

50|$|Bay {{leaves were}} used for {{flavoring}} by the ancient Greeks. They are a fixture in the cooking of many European cuisines (particularly those of the Mediterranean), {{as well as in}} the Americas. They are used in soups, stews, meat, seafood, vegetable dishes, and sauces. The leaves also flavor many classic French dishes. The leaves are most often used whole (sometimes in a bouquet garni) and removed <b>before</b> serving (<b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> abrasive in the digestive tract). Thai cuisine employs bay leaf (Thai name bai kra wan) in a few Arab-influenced dishes, notably massaman curry.|$|R
