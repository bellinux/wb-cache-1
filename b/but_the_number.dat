5|$|A Type 271 surface {{search radar}} {{replaced}} the fire-control director and rangefinder above the bridge. A Type 290 surface warning radar was added {{at the top}} of the foremast. A High frequency direction finding system was added on a pole mast aft. The ship also received a Type 242 IFF system. Two 4.7-inch guns were removed, one each forward and aft, and the forward gun was replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar. The 3-inch anti-aircraft gun amidships was also removed, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of 20mm AA guns was increased to six.|$|E
5|$|After the {{creation}} of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in 1933, nine camps and eight subcamps were set up in Boise National Forest, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of camps was reduced from 1934 until the program was closed in 1942. Work conducted by the CCC included fire suppression, fish habitat improvement, and construction of guard houses, fire lookouts, campgrounds, roads, and trails, among other facilities.|$|E
5|$|As of August 15, VA {{data showed}} {{that the number of}} {{veterans}} who were waiting more than three months for an appointment has declined by half since Spring 2014, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> who wait at least 30 days remains similar. Reported wait times for repeat patients have increased from 3.5 days to nearly 6 days. The VA paid for nearly 200,000 veterans to see private doctors, and average wait time to see a primary care doctor decreased from 51 to 43 days.|$|E

5|$|By Order 1191 of , Romania's Minister of War, Vintilă Brătianu, {{created the}} Volunteer Corps {{as a special}} {{formation}} of the national army. On the same day, in Darnytsia, Pietraru was tasked by Chief of Staff Constantin Prezan with equipping the new recruits and organizing them into units. The honorary command was assigned to Constantin Coandă, who was already the military attaché with Russia's Stavka (General Headquarters). Over the next month, in Mogilev, Coandă again negotiated the Corps' recognition by Stavka. Coandă received the permission, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of recruits was no longer clearly specified.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 19th and early 20th centuries the pier was popular both with locals and {{tourists}} to the town. As a boarding point for steamers plying their trade in the Bristol Channel, it underwent various extensions and modifications over the years. During the Second World War the pier was commissioned as HMS Birnbeck by the Admiralty as part of the Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development (DMWD) for research into new weapons. The pier reopened after the war, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of visitors and steamer passengers declined. The final excursion visited the pier in 1979.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{the band}} {{released}} Give Us Sugar, {{a compilation of}} assorted rarities from throughout their career including non-LP b-sides and songs previously exclusive to movie soundtracks. It {{was intended to be}} released as a limited edition of only 250 autographed copies, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of pre-orders far surpassed that limit, forcing the band to change the publishing and distribution approach.|$|E

Between 1994 and 1996 there is shown a rising trend in detection of illegal entrants <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> released on Temporary Admission increased steadily. People without legal qualification could function as immigration legal advisors; legal aid was available for immigration cases. Legal aid costs rose dramatically between 1988 and 1992 as did <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of applications for judicial review. By 1997 25% of all judicial reviews lodged were related to immigration cases.|$|R
5|$|In June 1944, the Manhattan Project {{employed}} some 129,000 workers, of whom 84,500 were construction workers, 40,500 were plant {{operators and}} 1,800 were military personnel. As construction activity fell off, the workforce declined to 100,000 a year later, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> {{of military personnel}} increased to 5,600. Procuring the required numbers of workers, especially highly skilled workers, in competition with other vital wartime programs proved very difficult. In 1943, Groves obtained a special temporary priority for labor from the War Manpower Commission. In March 1944, both the War Production Board and the War Manpower Commission gave the project their highest priority.|$|E
5|$|In {{this section}} Tolkien {{describes}} {{variations on the}} basic patterns. For example, dips (between lifts) were usually monosyllabic, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of syllables was not limited by Old English metre, so a series of weak syllables was permitted in a half-line. Other variations included breaking a lift into two syllables, the first short but stressed, the second weak, with for instance 'vĕssel' in place of 'boat'.|$|E
5|$|Most {{primates}} {{have two}} mammary glands, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> and positions vary between species within strepsirrhines. Lorises have two pairs, while others, like the ring-tailed lemur, have one pair {{on the chest}} (pectoral). The aye-aye also has two mammary glands, but they are located near the groin (inguinal). In females, the clitoris is sometimes enlarged and pendulous, resembling the male penis, which can make sex identification difficult for human observers. The clitoris may also have a bony structure in it, similar to the baculum (penis bone) in males. Most male primates have a baculum, but it is typically larger in strepsirrhines and usually forked at the tip.|$|E

It is not unusual in species that {{typically}} have five arms for some individuals to possess six or more through abnormal development.|$|E
5|$|Players {{are first}} {{brought to the}} options screen, where the {{starting}} level, game speed, and music can be chosen. The initial level chosen is a value between zero and twenty that determines the number of viruses to clear, and the three-game speed options change how fast the capsules fall within the bottle. The player's score is {{based solely on the}} elimination of viruses and the chosen game speed, with bonus points for clearing more than 1 in a single line. After level 20 you can still accumulate points <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of viruses to clear remains the same.|$|E

There are also numerous islands in Yell Sound between the Mainland and Yell and in St. Magnus Bay to the west, especially near the strait of Swarbacks Minn, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> and diverse locations of the Shetland islands makes further classification difficult.|$|E

5|$|The first upper molar (M1) was {{described}} as square by De Bruijn and as rounded by Prieto and Böhme. There are five main transverse crests, which are mostly isolated, but some may be connected on {{the borders of the}} teeth. The middle crest, the centroloph, reaches to the labial (outer) margin in the single known M1 of S.bolligeri, but does not in any of the five M1 of S.alpinus. The front crest, the anteroloph, is less distinct in S.bolligeri than most S.alpinus, but one M1 of S.alpinus {{is similar to that of}} S.bolligeri. M1 has three roots in S.alpinus, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of roots in S.bolligeri is not known.|$|E
5|$|The {{magistrate}} {{also made}} {{a survey of the}} spared parts of town from which it appears that 8,749former residents of the parts touched by fire had found new lodgings. It is estimated that as many as 15,000 had become homeless. This is about 20% of the population, which is estimated at 70,000. However the number of dead and wounded is unknown. It is possible to deduce some information from parish registers and other sources, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> remains uncertain.

In 1988, The Legend of Zelda sold two million copies. Nintendo of America sought to keep its strong base of fans; anyone who purchased a game and sent in a warranty card became a member of the Fun Club, whose members got a four-, eight- and eventually 32-page newsletter. Seven hundred copies of the first issue were sent out free of charge, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> grew as the data bank of names got larger.|$|E
