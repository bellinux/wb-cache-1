40|$|<b>Bank</b> <b>revenues</b> have a time {{variation}} pattern {{over the}} business cycle. Since revenues {{are a major}} determinant of bank capital and lending capacity, the time variation may {{have an impact on the}} real economy and may potentially amplify the business cycle. It will therefore be useful to understand how <b>bank</b> <b>revenues</b> vary over time, and in particular what are the relationships with key macroeconomic variables. The present paper sets out to investigate these relationships more deeply in the context of the Norwegian banking industry. The banking literature contains only a handful of studies of how <b>bank</b> <b>revenues</b> vary over the business cycle, and they all look exclusively on the net interest margin. The general conclusion has been that the margin tends to increase during recessions and decrease during booms. This paper extends the existing literature by taking the volume effect into account and looking at net interest income, and also by looking at how fee income varies over the cycle. The paper is written in the context of an on-going research programme at Norges Bank Financial Stability, aiming to develop procedures for stress testing the profitability and capital adequacy of the Norwegian banking sector.

In contrast, when non-interest income is broken down into its constituent parts—fee income, trading income and other non-interest income—we find that a shift toward fee income-generating business decreases all types of risks (systematic risk, idiosyncratic risk, and total risk). Furthermore, we find that the effects of <b>bank’s</b> <b>revenue</b> diversification on franchise value and risks are contingent on organizational forms and performance of traditional banking business. ...|$|R

GDP growth impacts significantly on fees and commissions. Second, our macroeconomic stress testing exercises tend to show that fees and commission {{and to a lesser extent}} trading incomes are much more sensitive to some adverse macroeconomic shocks than interest income.

40|$|Central bank {{provisions}} {{may be used}} as {{a measure}} of the perceived risk of the balance sheet composition by a central bank.

Using data of the eleven founding members of the Eurosystem for the years 1999 - 2014 we are able to test each of the three determinants. We find that provisions are increased with the size of the balance sheet especially in the recent financial crisis. Moreover, provisions are increased at the cost of lower central <b>bank</b> <b>revenues.</b> While this holds for the pre-crisis period this relationship seems to collapse in the crisis period probably because of the more active collateral policy.

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis {{that started in}} 2008 has {{had a significant impact}} around the global. In the US alone, it is estimated that approximately 14 trillion of wealth has been lost (Luhby 2009). A considerable body of literature has focused on the role of excessive risk-taking by banks in the years preceding the crisis (Laeven & Levine 2009; Fouque & Langsam 2013; Weiß et al. 2014). We still have limited knowledge, however, about why some financial institutions take more excessive risks than others, despite the fact that these financial institutions are subject to the same financial regulations and macroeconomic environment (Lo 2011; Barone-Adesi et al. 2013; Xiong 2013). This concern about excessive risk taking by banks has encouraged scholars to study the possible causes. A common argument is that the subprime and {{financial crisis}} was not due to regulatory failure, but psychological failure (Shefrin 2009; Barberis 2011). If this is the case, it would suggest that any explanation of the causes of the recent banking crisis that focuses only on bank characteristics, failure of financial regulations and market discipline may be incomplete. First of all I find that managerial overconfidence could influence the language style and tone, tested by DICTION, of the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section of annual reports, as well as the whole 10 -K report. The results tentatively suggest that the MD&A contains vocabulary {{that can be used to}} capture CEO overconfidence. Secondly, using a sample of 189 U. S bank holding companies involving 261 CEOs from 1994 to 2014, I examine whether CEO overconfidence affects BHCs’ risk-taking choices, and its subsequent systemic risk effects. The results suggest that managerial overconfidence is positively associated with systemic risk. I also find that mortgage-backed securities and provisioning for loan-losses can serve as the drivers of systemic instability. Finally, I examine the impact of CEO overconfidence on bank diversification. The results suggest that CEO overconfidence does appear significantly to influence the degree of non-traditional <b>banking</b> <b>revenue</b> and asset diversification. The results also indicate that overconfident CEOs tend to be detrimental for bank performance when the degree of business complexity increase. BHCs with overconfident CEOs, and with a higher degree of asset diversification, are associated with higher systemic risk as measured by MES. In contrast, BHCs with overconfident CEOs can curtail tail risk exposures if these BHCs are geared towards a higher degree of revenue diversification...|$|E
30|$|Finally, we can {{see from}} Table 4 that while {{inflation}} {{has no effect on}} non-interest income, GDP has a positive and an indirect significant impact. This conclusion reveals that when economic performance is flourishing the banking sector is also performing well and banks looks more for new opportunity to innovate and diversify their revenues. To conclude, a buoyant economic growth in Tunisia would support the performance of the banking sector and could provide opportunities to diversify <b>bank</b> <b>revenues.</b> These findings are different from the work of Hakimi et al. (2012) where inflation exerts a negative and significant effect however inflation do not has any significant effect. In theory, previous studies have reported a positive association between inflation and bank profitability. High inflation rates are generally associated with high loan interest rates. However, if inflation are not anticipated and banks are sluggish in adjusting their interest rates then {{there is a possibility that}} bank costs may increase faster than <b>bank</b> <b>revenues</b> and hence adversely affect bank profitability (Ben Naceur and Goaied (2008).|$|R

We also examine the effect of regulatory intervention on LLPs, measuring regulatory intervention using three variables: capital ratio, liquidity of assets, and bank size.

The author places particular emphasis on relatively new restrictions designed to induce customers to adopt cost-saving behavior, such as restrictions on the return of canceled checks and on the use of live tellers.

40|$|President Obama’s {{endorsement}} of the “Volcker Rule ” – a set of proposals designed to reduce public financial support for risky proprietary trading and hedge/private equity fund ownership by commercial banks and bank holding companies- has elicited an intense chorus of criticism from bankers, economists and policy makers. These critics make three main claims. First, proprietary trading {{had little to do}} with the current financial crisis and therefore restricting it would do little to prevent a replay; and second, proprietary trading provides a very small percentage of <b>bank</b> <b>revenues</b> and therefore is not significant. Third, Volcker’s very narrow limits would make it easy for bankers to evade the restrictions. In this note we argue that conventional banker wisdom is incorrect: proprietary trading had a great deal to do with the crisis and it also contributes significantly to major <b>bank</b> <b>revenue.</b> Yet, critics are right to argue that the Volcker rule has to be strengthened and broadened, specifically to large investment banks and the shadow banking system, in order to significantly reduce the risk in the system to acceptable levels and to limit the likelihood of the need for future taxpayer bail-outs.

40|$|The {{last thirty}} years in the US have been {{characterized}} by rising financial profits {{as a share of}} total profits and the growth of banking activities yielding non-interest income. These developments pose two questions. First, what are the social relations enabling and sustaining financial profits and what are their macroeconomic sources? Second, what do these trends imply for the nature of banking and what kind of theory of banking can capture them? This study addresses these questions and makes four contributions. ^ First, a Marxist theory of banking is developed to capture the transformation of banking drawing on two characteristics: first, emphasis on liquidity provision through exchange of promises to pay among credit participants and, second, explicit connection between <b>bank</b> <b>revenues</b> and macroeconomic aggregates (wages, profits, assets). It is shown that a Marxist theory of banking can be a more general theory of banking retaining strengths of other approaches and overcoming their limitations. ^ Second, it is shown that the corporate form of business organization and the attendant capital markets create opportunities to extract a range of profits with similar characteristics, i. e., capital gain-like revenues. The key features of their simplest form—founder’s profit—are shown also to hold for securitization revenues and, partly, for profit from mergers and acquisitions. These revenues hinge on wealth transfers across the society and, therefore, differ from profits from production. ^ Third, by bringing together the Marxist theory of banking and the analysis of capital gain-like revenues, liquidity provision is shown to form the basis for banks’ sharing in capital gain-like income. The core functions of banking can, therefore, co-exist with, and even form the basis, for a significant transformation of <b>bank</b> <b>revenues.</b> Examination of the multiplicity of forms of capital gain-like revenues shows that their extraction is the common driving force behind the apparently heterogeneous activities associated with the transformation of banking. ^ Fourth, empirical analysis of the US bank holding companies confirms that capital gain-like revenues were a significant part of <b>bank</b> <b>revenues</b> in 2001 – 2010. Given the rising household vulnerability toward wealth transfers, this trend suggests a reinstatement of predatory aspects of finance in contemporary capitalism. ...|$|R
