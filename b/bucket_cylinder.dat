40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose a new type of {{excavator}} - electric excavator (ELEX) - with energy saving capacity using six quasi independent electro-hydraulic actuators (EHAs). The quasi-independent configuration minimizes hydraulic interferences among the actuators and losses which occur in traditional hydraulic excavators (HYEXs). In addition, the boom/arm/or <b>bucket</b> <b>cylinder</b> is driven by a closed EHA system, so that potential energy accumulated at "up" positions can be recuperated and converted into electricity via the EHA generator when the boom/arm/or bucket goes down, respectively. Kinetic energy of the upper slewing body also can be recovered and converted into electricity when a slewing stop happens. A 5 -ton excavator using a hybrid boom system (HBS) was analyzed, developed as an experimental ELEX (EELEX) for evaluating the proposed ELEX. A control strategy for the 5 -ton EELEX was built to operate the machine to follow desired performances. Higher working efficiency and less energy consumption of the EELEX have been clearly verified through simulations and experiments in comparison with the conventional 5 -ton HYEX...|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} work, {{an assessment of}} hydraulic cylinder housing is presented. First, the in-service loads are measured for the three most fatigue-stressed cylinders of an earth moving machine: boom, arm and <b>bucket</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Fatigue crack propagation tests were then carried out, on C(T) specimens extracted from cylinders, under both constant amplitude and service stress time histories. Finally, comparison between experimental outcomes and crack growth calculations carried out by means of both the Strip-Yield model and a simple “no interaction” model are presented...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNowadays, the {{utilization}} ofmonitoring systems and advanced IT technology {{in order to}} support maintenance management in complex machinery systems is widely-used {{at all levels of the}} maintenance. One of the purposes for using such systems in a copper ore underground mine is to assess the performance of self-propelled machines, e. g. loaders. The effectiveness of the loader operation might be estimated by taking into account different sources of information and evaluation criteria. This paper presents a method for the identification of a loader operation regime: loading, haulage and unloading of ore. It is expected that such a cycle should be repeated during a single shift. The proposed algorithm is based on the measurements of the hydraulic pressure acquired on the <b>bucket's</b> hydraulic <b>cylinder.</b> This signal is very noisy, thus further analysisrequires it's smoothing. We propose to incorporate the Kalman filter in order to smooth the signal. Kalman filtering is commonly used in optimal filtering of nonstationary signals. Further steps of the proposed algorithm indicate moments of basic loader's routines. Finally, the information about the number and duration of loading and unloading cycles is provided. The algorithm is illustrated by an analysis of real data from the monitoring system that describes the pressure measured on the <b>bucket's</b> hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> during the entire 6 -hour-long shift...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Based on {{the bucket}} teeth load-time courses {{calculation}} model under bucket digging condition, the stresses on the hydraulic cylinder piston rods of boom and bucket and the real-time length of <b>bucket</b> hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> were set as measured variables, and a measuring method of the bucket teeth load-time courses was developed {{which had the}} advantages of less measuring points, simplified measurement process and low cost. The bucket teeth load-time courses were calculated by inputting the measuring data into the self-developed Constructing Hydraulic Excavators Load Spectrum software, and its characteristics of each digging step in one excavation cycle at digging macadam were analyzed. Then, using rain-flow counting module in FE-SAFE software, the statistical graphs of bucket teeth load-time courses were acquired which could {{provide the basis for}} hydraulic excavator reliability design and fatigue life prediction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Force {{feedback}} sensors {{are useful}} for the planning of robotic digging trajectories. In particular, when combined with force-control algorithms it becomes possible to sense buried objects and to determine the weight of excavated materials. The proposed force sensor system makes use of hydraulic cylinder pressure and thereby measures machine force indirectly. Successful implementation of such an approach will {{eliminate the need for}} expensive, direct-force sensors. Measurements of pressures in candidate cylinders were compared with laboratory-measured stroke and force. To measure force in every position and during the motion of a backhoe, kinematic, static and dynamic inertial parameters of the bucket, arm and other links have to be considered. From these data a friction model of the hydraulic cylinders can be developed. The present work involves the determination of these friction parameters for an excavator arm using position measures of the <b>bucket</b> and boom, <b>cylinder</b> pressures and the attitude of the excavator boom. Combined, these represent the “dynamic tare ” of system. The work includes a practical approach to filtering regression matrix to do not measure accelerations. The methods allows one to carry out inertial parameters for a full machine, in order to verified design and drawning of costruction machine or to use as input for simulation of machine dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] An {{excavator}} is {{a typical}} hydraulic heavy-duty human-operated machine used in general versatile construction operations, such as digging, ground leveling, carrying loads, dumping loads and straight traction. Normally backhoe excavators are working under worst working conditions. Due to severe working conditions, excavator parts are subjected to high loads and must work reliably under unpredictable working conditions. The objective {{of this paper is}} to analyze the existing design and redesign the excavator boom which is suitable for side digging and also for digging over hanged part of wall. Modeling of excavator attachment like boom, long arm, small arm, <b>cylinder,</b> <b>bucket</b> & coupling is done by using INVENTOR software. Model is exported through IGES file format for MESHING in Altair Hypermesh Analysis Software. Meshing is done using suitable type of elements. Material property is assigned; Boundary conditions and the forces are applied. Static analysis is done in INVERTOR software which is being supported by ANSYS software. During operation of excavator at different positions the stresses induced in the attachments varies. The forces applied in the analysis were calculated by using INVENTOR software, and reported that the Arm, Boom and Bucket shows stress in the attachment are coming under allowable limit. For reducing stresses and for optimum weight of the excavator parts, thickness of the material is reduced in the modeling. Keyword [...] Rotary excavator boom, bucket, INVENTOR software. I...|$|R
