40|$|This Environmental Assessment (EA) {{has been}} {{prepared}} to analyze potential environmental impacts relevant to the proposed <b>installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> of an Electronic Warfare (EW) Range in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). The purpose of the Proposed Action is to sustain and enhance the level and type of EW training currently being conducted by Navy assets using the Northwest Training Range Complex (NWTRC), to provide the ability to accommodate growth in future training requirements, and to maximize the ability of local units to achieve their training requirements on local ranges. Three alternatives have been analyzed in this EA: • Under the No Action Alternative, very limited EW training, without the enhanced capability of fixed and mobile emitters, {{would continue to be}} conducted in the NWTRC; and intermediate-level EW training for certification would continue to occur at the Mountain Home Air Force Base approximately 400 nautical miles southeast of Naval Air Station Whidbey Island (NASWI). • Alternative 1 includes: • <b>Installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> of a Mission Control and Debrief Center in an existing facility at NASWI • <b>Installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> of a fixed emitter at Naval Station Everett Annex Pacific Beach, to include renovation of Building 104 • <b>Installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> of communication equipment on an existing tower in the Olympic Military Operations Area (MOA) at Octopus Mountai...|$|R
