In the present study the <b>biodistributions</b> of two types of PLGA nanocolloids were compared, nanocapsules with an oily core loaded with carbocyanine dyes and solid nanoparticles with the fluorescent dye covalently linked. The nanocolloids were produced by nanoprecipitation; all were of injectable sizes, showed monodispersity and negative zeta potentials. The <b>biodistributions</b> of DiD dye loaded nanocapsules with an oily core and solid nanoparticles conjugated to the dye DY- 700 were injected in mice, and followed over 24 hours through NIR imaging, before organs were collected and imaged. Bone marrow was also collected. Solid nanoparticles were also made with a polymer covalently linked to rhodamine. After 24 hours the organs were collected for further ex vivo analysis by confocal microscopy. The nanocolloids seemed to accumulate mainly in the liver, spleen and the intestine. The accumulation developed differently, and the PEGylated nanocarriers showed indications of longer circulation times, and lower accumulation in the liver. The oily core nanocapsules showed fluorescence accumulation in the bones, which was not seen with the solid nanocapsules. This was confirmed by quantification of fluorescence in collected bone marrow. This, together with accumulation in the intestine and fluorescence lifetime investigations suggested that DiD loaded nanocapsules release some dye. In line with this nanocolloids with the fluorescent dye covalently linked did not accumulate in the bone marrow, and to a small degree in the intestine. The ex vivo investigations were in concurrence with the results seen in vivo. PEGylated nanoparticles dominated in the spleen and brown adipose tissue whereas unPEGylated nanoparticles dominated in the liver and lungs. Taken together, this study give insight in the <b>biodistributions</b> of nanocolloids intended for incorporation of chemotherapeutics, and also {{one has to be}} careful when choosing fluorescence labelling approach for in vivo detection of nanoparticles...|$|R

2500|$|Pharmacokinetics: In pre-clinical trials, it is {{possible}} to radiolabel a new drug and inject it into animals. [...] Such scans are referred to as <b>biodistribution</b> studies. [...] The uptake of the drug, the tissues in which it concentrates, and its eventual elimination, can be monitored far more quickly and cost effectively than the older technique of killing and dissecting the animals to discover the same information. [...] Much more commonly, however, drug occupancy at a purported site of action can be inferred indirectly by competition studies between unlabeled drug and radiolabeled compounds known apriori to bind with specificity to the site. [...] A single radioligand can be used this way to test many potential drug candidates for the same target. [...] A related technique involves scanning with radioligands that compete with an endogenous (naturally occurring) substance at a given receptor to demonstrate that a drug causes the release of the natural substance.|$|E

50|$|Research {{has been}} {{conducted}} on in vivo <b>biodistribution</b> and highly efficient tumor targeting of carbon nanotubes in mice for cancer therapy. Investigations are being done on the <b>biodistribution</b> of radio-labelled SWNTs in mice by in vivo positron emission tomography (PET), ex vivo <b>biodistribution</b> and Raman spectroscopy. It was found that SWNTs that are functionalized with phospholipids bearing polyethylene glycol (PEG) are surprisingly stable in vivo. The effect of PEG chain length on the <b>biodistribution</b> and circulation of the SWNTs was studied. Effectively PEGylated SWNTs exhibited relatively long blood circulation times and low uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Efficient targeting of integrin positive tumor in mice was achieved with SWNTs coated with PEG chains linked to an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide. A high tumor accumulation was attributed to the multivalent effect of the SWNTs. The Raman signatures of SWNTs were used to directly probe the presence of nanotubes in mice tissues and confirm the radio-label-based results.|$|E

40|$|Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with 90 Y-labeled anti-CD 66 {{antibody}} {{is used to}} selectively irradiate the {{red marrow}} (RM) before blood stem cell transplantation of acute leukemia patients. To calculate the activity to administer, time-integrated activity coefficients are required. These are estimated prior to therapy using gamma camera and serum measurements after injection of 111 In labeled anti-CD 66 antibody. Equal pre-therapeutic and therapeutic <b>biodistributions</b> are usually assumed to calculate the coefficients. However, additional measurements during therapy had shown that this assumption had to be abandoned. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to allow the prediction of therapeutic time-integrated activity coefficients in eight patients. The aims {{of the study were}} to demonstrate using a larger patient group 1) the need to perform patient-specific dosimetry in 90 Y-labeled anti-CD 66 RIT, 2) that pre-therapeutic and therapeutic <b>biodistributions</b> differ, and most importantly 3) that this difference in <b>biodistributions</b> can be accurately predicted using a refined model. Two new PBPK models were developed considering fully, half and non-immunoreactive antibodies and constraints for estimating the RM antigen number. Both models were fitted to gamma camera and serum measurements of 27 patients. Akaike weights were used for model averaging. Time-integrated activity coefficients for total body, liver, spleen, RM and serum were calculated. Model-based predictions of the serum biokinetics during therapy were compared to actual measurements. Variability of the RM time-integrated activity coefficients ((37. 3 ± 7. 5) h) indicates the need for patient-specific dosimetry. The relative differences between pre-therapeutic and therapeutic serum time-activity curves were (- 25 ± 16) %. The prediction accuracy of these differences using the refined PBPK models was (- 3 ± 20) %. Individual treatment is needed due to biological differences between patients in RIT with 90 Y-labeled anti-CD 66 antibody. Differences in pre-therapeutic and therapeutic biokinetics are predominantly caused by different degrees of saturation due to different amounts of administered antibody. These differences could be predicted using the PBPK models...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The use {{of copper}} radioisotopes in imaging and therapy {{applications}} {{has created a}} greater need for bifunctional chelates (BFCs) for complexing copper radioisotopes to biomolecules. It has been demon-strated that the charge and lipophilicity of the Cu-BFC complex has {{a significant effect on}} the in vivo behavior of the radiolabeled Cu-BFC-biomolecule conjugate. To evaluate the effects of charge, stability, and macrocyclic backbone size on the biological behavior of 64 Cu complexes, a series of macrocyclic 64 Cu complexes have been prepared, and the <b>biodistributions</b> of these agents were evaluated in normal Sprague-Dawley rats. Two macrocyclic backbones, dodecane and tetradecane, were evaluated; cyclen, DOTA, and DO 2 A were dodecane backbone derivatives, and cyclam, TETA, and et-cyclam were tetradecane backbone derivatives. The <b>biodistributions</b> of the 64 Cu-labeled complexes correlated with differences {{in the size of the}} macrocycle backbone and the formal charge of the complex. All compounds showed uptake and clearance through the liver and kidneys; however, the positively charged 64 Cu complexes showed significantly higher uptake in both of these organs than did the negatively charged or neutral complexes. 64 Cu-TETA, a negatively charged complex with the tetradecane backbone, had the most efficient clearance by 24 hours’ postinjection. These data suggest that negatively charged complexes may have more favorable clearanc...|$|R
