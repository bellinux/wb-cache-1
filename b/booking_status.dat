40|$|Background: Congenital malformations are a {{major cause}} of {{perinatal}} and neonatal deaths, and disability both in developed and developing countries. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the pattern of congenital anomalies seen in babies admitted into the special care baby unit of University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Benin City, Edo state, Nigeria. Method: A prospective register of all congenital anomalies seen in newborns were kept within the study period of 2 years. The details of each child′s anomaly were documented and characterized. All the babies with congenital anomalies admitted from f January 2008 to 31 st December 2009 were included in this study. Results: A total of 153 babies were admitted during the study period, 85 (5. 6 %) had congenital anomalies. More male babies had congenital anomalies, though the finding was not statistically significant. <b>Booking</b> <b>status</b> of the mother was significantly associated with having a child with congenital anomalies. More term babies had congenital anomalies than preterm babies. One quarter of the babies with congenital anomalies, died within the neonatal period. Gastrointestinal system malformations (36. 5 %) were the most common. CNS anomalies was second (29. 4 %) with myelomeningocele being the most common anomaly (18. 8 %), followed by musculoskeletal system anomalies (14. 2 %), genitourinary system (10. 6 %), chromosomal (5. 9 %), cardiovascular (3. 5 %). Conclusion: The pattern of congenital anomalies in our region is different from that of developed countries. The <b>booking</b> <b>status</b> of the mother is significantly associated with having a child with congenital anomaly.

40|$|It is {{not known}} whether infants exposed to {{intermittent}} maternal fasting at conception are born smaller or have {{a higher risk of}} premature birth than those who are not. Doctors are therefore unsure about what advice to give women about the safety of Ramadan fasting. This cohort study aimed to investigate these questions in Muslim mother-infant pairs to inform prenatal care. Routinely collected data accessed from maternity records were the source for information. Mothers were considered exposed if they were Muslim and Ramadan overlapped with their infant conception date, estimated to be 14  days after the last menstrual period. Infants were included as exposed if their estimated conception date was in the first 21  days of Ramadan or 7  days prior to Ramadan. After adjusting for gestational age, maternal age, infant gender, maternal body mass index at <b>booking,</b> smoking <b>status,</b> gestational diabetes, parity and year of birth, {{there was no significant difference}} in birth weight between infants born to Muslim mothers who were conceived during Ramadan (n= 479) and those who were not (n= 4677) (adjusted mean difference = 24. 3  g, 95 % CI - 16. 4 to 64. 9). There was no difference in rates of premature births in exposed and unexposed women (5. 2 % vs 4. 9 %; OR= 1. 08, 95 % CI 0. 71 to 1. 65).

Almost all stillbirths (98 %) occur in low and middle income countries, with Nigeria having the third largest burden. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the stillbirth rate and its determinants in the Federal Medical Centre Katsina, located in north western Nigeria. This study was a retrospective review of all deliveries conducted between 1 st March 2010 and 31 st December 2012 in Federal Medical Centre Katsina.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} the demographic, environmental, and medical {{factors that influence}} the relative weights of the newborn infant and the placenta and compare this ratio with other factors known to predispose to adult ill health. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The tertiary referral centre for perinatal care in Perth, Western Australia. SUBJECTS: 2507 pregnant women who delivered a single live infant at term. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Placental weight, birth weight, and the ratio of placental weight to birth weight. RESULTS: By multiple regression analysis the placental weight to birthweight ratio was significantly and positively associated with gestational age, female sex, Asian parentage, increasing maternal body mass index, increased maternal weight at <b>booking,</b> lower socioeconomic <b>status,</b> maternal anaemia, and increasing number of cigarettes smoked daily. There were no consistent relations between the placental weight to birthweight ratio and measures of newborn size. CONCLUSIONS: The ratio of placental weight to birth weight is not an accurate marker of fetal growth. In {{its role as a}} predictor of adult disease the ratio may be acting as a surrogate for other factors which are already known to influence health and may act before or after birth.

Main Outcome Measures: Delay in submission and completeness of reports, age, marital status, religion, reproductive history, <b>booking</b> and referral <b>status,</b> duration and outcome of pregnancy, place of death, cause of death. Results: 92 / 95 notifications were true maternal deaths, 86 % were notified within 48 hours and 79 % were complete, 74 % of the deaths took place in a health facility. Mean age of the women was 27. 8 years, mean parity 3. 0. Sixty percent had booked. The five main causes of death were obstetric haemorrhage (26 %), malaria (24 %), immune deficiency syndrome (13 %), abortion (11 %) and eclampsia (8 %). The maternal mortality ratio per 100 000 reported home and institutional live births ranged from 155 to 532 per district. Conclusion: There is under reporting of maternal mortality in some districts, although from 1997 to 2000 a 200 % increase in reporting was seen.

40|$|Refugees and {{asylum seekers}} flee their home {{countries}} worldwide {{as a result of}} conflict and other reasons, and Scotland is home to thousands of refugees and asylum seekers. The aim {{of this study was to}} find out possible issues which may arise for refugee and asylum seekers in Scotland when accessing reproductive health (RH) services. The literature search on the rest of the United Kingdom (UK) in relation to access to RH services for asylum seeking and refugee women showed seven key access issues which comprised: communication and the language barrier, missed appointments or late antenatal care (ANC) <b>booking,</b> immigration <b>status,</b> dispersal, insufficient information, provider attitudes and health systems and cultural differences. The UK findings formed the basis for the study questions of the second part of the study which was done through primary data collection. Initial interview questions were more general, followed by questions related to the seven UK findings. Responses from three providers who were interviewed, one from Glasgow (2 - 6 Sandyford Place) and two in Edinburgh (Pennywell Resource Centre) revealed similarities with the UK findings except in the area of the provider attitude that did not come up during interviews with providers. A web-based search for information materials together with a visit to two facilities in Edinburgh and Glasgow was done in order to analyse how and the type of material on RH services are shared with women and the type of information provided. The findings revealed that although most asylum seeking and refugee women (ASARW) cannot speak or read English, most of the materials were predominantly written in English, which is another challenge to accessing information for these women and the type of information provided. Even though National Health Service (NHS) and Sandyford provide translation and interpretation services, challenges were still experienced in terms of the limited number of key languages that materials can be translated into and the lack of: interpreters for some languages or interprteters of the desired gender, and their limited availability in some cases. Finally, the Liverpool gender analysis framework for health was adapted for discussing the findings in relation to: the environment, bargaining position, resources, activities and gender norms, and Paul Farmer’s theory on structural violence was also used. The further broader research was recommended to include ASARW from different countries and groups in order to get a broader perspective on the findings...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} magnitude, {{determinants of}} perinatal mortality and suggest remedial measures for its reduction. Background: Perinatal mortality is mirror reflection of maternal {{and child health}} and socioeconomic environment of community. It is influenced by various medicosocial preventable causes. It can be reduced by improving {{maternal and child health}} services and by health education. Methods: A retrospective hospital based study of perinatal deaths among 2333 deliveries was conducted from June 2008 to June 2010 in our hospital. Fetomaternal factors like maternal age, religion, residence, parity, mode of delivery, <b>booking</b> <b>status,</b> antenatal complications, baby’s sex, birth weight, congenital anomalies, neonatal complications influencing perinatal mortality rate were tabulated and analyzed. Cause of perinatal death was assessed. Results: perinatal mortality rate was 127. 4 / 1000 total births. Maternal factors like age more than 35 years, muslim religion, inadequate antenatal care, primiparity, grand multiparity, induced deliveries and neonatal factors like low birth weight, prematurity were associated with increased perinatal mortality. The leading cause of stillbirth was antepartum hemorrhage and prematurity for neonatal mortality. Conclusion: Apart from clinical causes high perinatal mortality was due to poverty, illiteracy, lack of health awareness, inadequate antenatal care and delayed referral. Health education, identification of high risk mothers, timely referral, advanced life support of preterm neonates should significantly help to reduce perinatal deaths...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Eclampsia is a {{very serious}} {{complication}} of pregnancy which is responsible for high maternal and perinatal mortality. Worldwide, it accounts for 50, 000 maternal deaths annually. In spite of several global and regional interventions and initiatives from governments and other concerned agencies, maternal mortality is still very high in India, with eclampsia as a major cause. This study was conducted to determine the mode of deaths and incidence of maternal mortality associated with eclampsia and to assess how socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the women influence the deaths. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 111 eclampsia related maternal deaths over a period of 5 years from January 2008 to December 2012. Data pertaining to their age, parity, <b>booking</b> <b>status,</b> gestational age at delivery, and time interval from admission to death were also obtained from the records for analysis. RESULTS: Eclampsia accounted for 43. 35 % of total maternal deaths, with case fatality of 4. 960 %. The commonest mode of death in eclampsia is pulmonary oedema. Death due to eclampsia commonly occurs in younger age group of 19 - 24 years and in primi gravid. Eclampsia related deaths were mostly seen in illiterate and unbooked cases. Maternal deaths were also very common in lower socio economic status. CONCLUSION: Eclampsia still remains the major cause of maternal mortality in this region resulting from unsupervised pregnancies and deliveries. There is a need to educate and encourage the general public for antenatal care and hospital delivery by which we can defeat this powerful enemy...|$|E
40|$|Aims: 1. To {{establish}} {{the extent of}} Syphilis in Pregnancy and the association of syphilis with unbooked status and perinatal deaths. 2. To determine why the diagnosis was not made in forty cases of Early Congenital Syphilis. Objectives: 1. To {{establish the}} percentage of patients with syphilis at delivery and possible association between unbooked status and positive syphilis serology. 2. To determine the Perinatal Mortality Rate and establish what percentage of perinatal death s occurred in unbooked patients and in those with positive syphilis serology. 3. To establish <b>booking</b> <b>status,</b> place of delivery, whether treated or not, serological findings, {{signs and symptoms of}} infants with Early Congenital Syphilis. Study Design: 1. A descriptive, retrospective study of deliveries in the month of March 1994. 2. A descriptive, prospective study of perinatal deaths over six-month period January to Jun e 1995. 3. A descriptive, retrospective study of Early Congenital Syphilis patients over five-year period 1990 - 1994. Setting: Maternity and paediatric wards at Provincial Hospital Uitenhage, East Cape. Patients and Methods: 1. Records were studied of 154 maternity patients delivering in March 1994 in order to ascertain <b>booking</b> <b>status</b> and serology results. 2. Data on sixty-one perinatal deaths weighing over 500 grams was examined to establish maternal booking and serological status. 3. Folders of forty patients with Early Congenital Syphilis admitted to the paediatric ward were examined. Results: 1. Syphilis in Pregnancy: i) Prevalence of syphilis at delivery was 9 % for patients with titres =/> 1 : 8. ii) Unbooked patients totalled 47 % of deliveries (73 / 154). iii) Fifteen percent of deliveries had no syphilis serology tests performed and were discharged without screening (23 / 154). iv) No significant association was found between unbooked status and positive serology (p= 0. 35). 2. Perinatal Deaths: i) In instances of a perinatal death, a significant association was found between unbooked status and positive RPR serology (p= 0. 017). ii) Perinatal death rate due to syphilis totalled 10. 8 / 1000 deliveries. 3. Early Congenital Syphilis: i) Eighty-five percent of cases (34 / 40) delivered at PHU and were mismanaged by personnel. ii) Eighteen of the thirty-four mothers had attended antenatal clinic and were untreated or inadequately treated by the time of delivery (53 %). vii iii) Sixteen of the mothers had been unbooked and were discharged without screening or treatment (47 %). iv) Four booked patients had negative sousveillance during the antenatal period. Conclusion: Provincial Hospital Uitenhage serves a poor community. This is reflected in the high prevalence of syphilis at delivery and the high proportion of unbooked patients. Time-consuming and inefficient methods of sero-surveillance plus separate clinics and staff for antenatal and Sexually Transmitted Diseases compounded existing problems. The standard of care anticipated at a Level 2 Referral Hospital was not delivered by Health Workers, largely due to lack of in-service training and guidelines for the management of Syphilis in Pregnancy. Recommendations: 1. In-service staff training by the Perinatal Education Programme (PEP) and adoption of protocols of management. 2. Rapid ("same-day") availability of serology results and initiation of treatment at Antenatal Clinic. 3. RPR at booking visit and repeated at delivery in all patients. 4.

Women who had a dating ultrasound before 20 weeks gestation and registering for antenatal care at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, between February and December 2013 and met the inclusion criteria were recruited into a cohort study. BMI was assessed at baseline. Blood pressure measurements were taken at (± 2) 24, 28 and 36 weeks. Primary outcome measure of interest during follow-up was a diagnosis of PIH at these points. BP changes during follow up at the three points were measured. Descriptive analysis of baseline factors was carried out and compared for the BMI groups. Relative risk (RR) of PIH was estimated at 95 % confidence interval. Mean (SD) age for the 361 women was 30. 9 (4. 8) years. Incidence of PIH amongst the cohort was 10. 5 % (95 % CI: 7. 45 % - 14. 45 %) and 40. 4 % and 33. 0 % of them were overweight and obese respectively at baseline. Pregnant women who were obese at baseline had a three-fold increased risk of PIH compared to those with normal BMI [RR = 3. 01 (1. 06 - 8. 52), p = 0. 04].

The aim {{of the study is}} to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women. &# 13; Methods: This study was a prospective study conducted in the department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at B. P. Koirala Institute of Health Sciences. The duration of the study was six months from January to June 2012. A total of 600 pregnant women were enrolled. All women were clinically identified to have no signs and symptoms of UTI. Clean catch midstream urine sample was collected from each patient into a sterile vial. The urine samples were examined for microscopic and culture sensitivity test. &# 13; Results: Out of 600 pregnant women, 52 were positive for significant bacteriuria with a prevalence rate of 8. 7 %. There was a significant difference in prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria with respect to trimester (p= 0. 005). Age did not show any significant difference in the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (p= 0. 807). There was not any significant difference in the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria with respect to parity (p= 0. 864) and <b>booking</b> <b>status</b> (p= 0. 397). Escherichia coli (35 %), Acinetobacter species (15 %), Enterococcus species (12 %) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (10 %) were the common isolates.

40|$|Objective: Study of {{maternal}} deaths {{to find out}} the causes and factors leading to maternal mortality. Methods: A descriptive analysis {{of maternal}} deaths at Omdurman maternity hospital during, the one year period between 1 / 8 / 2001 to 31 / 7 / 2002 was conducted. Results: The total number of deaths was 30 cases out of 14500 deliveries and the corrected maternal mortality rate is 206 per 100, 000 births. The most important factor leading to maternal death is absence of antenatal care. Death among unbooked ladies compared to booked ladies was much higher. The correlation between <b>booking</b> <b>status</b> as general and maternal death was statistically highly significant. Of all causes of maternal death hypertension in pregnancy was the leading cause of death, causing 14 deaths (46. 66 % of all deaths). Again booking was studied in hypertensive ladies and its correlation with maternal death was significant. The second cause of death was shared between haemorrhage and hepatic coma, both causing 4 deaths which is 13. 33 % of all deaths. This to be followed by sepsis which has caused 3 deaths (10 %), both pulmonary embolism and portal hypertension caused 2 deaths (6. 66 %), and finally malaria which has caused one death (3. 33 %) Conclusion At the level of primary prevention it is recommended that, provision of effective free antenatal care with qualified staff to all pregnant women {{all over the country and}} a special plan dedicated to hypertensive disorders with pregnancy. Health education about importance of antenatal care and risks of its omission should be delivered to community and specially women.

This paper reports a facility based study in north-central Nigeria to determine the magnitude, trends, causes and characteristics of maternal deaths before and after the launch of the Safe Motherhood Initiative in Nigeria, with a view to suggesting strategic interventions to reduce these deaths. The records of all deliveries and case files of all women who died during pregnancy and childbirth between January 1, 1985 and December 31, 2001, in the maternity unit of Jos University Teaching Hospital, Jos, Nigeria, were reviewed. Data collected were analysed for socio-biological variables including age, <b>booking</b> <b>status,</b> educational level, parity, ethnic group, marital status, mode of delivery, duration of hospital stay before death occurred, cause (s) of maternal deaths. There were 38, 768 deliveries and 267 maternal deaths during the period under review, giving a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) of 740 / 100, 000 total deliveries. The trend fluctuated between 450 in 1990 and 1, 010 / 100. 000 deliveries in 1994. The mean age of maternal death was 26. 4 (SD 8. 1) years. The greatest risk of MMR was among young teenagers (> 15 years) and older women (< 40 years). Parity-specific maternal mortality ratio was highest in the grand multiparous women. Unbooked as well as illiterate women were associated with very high maternal mortality ratio. The Hausa – Fulani ethnic group contributed the largest number (44 %) by tribe to maternal mortality in our study.

Aim: This study investigated differences in risk factors for maternal complications in booked and unbooked pregnant women in Nigeria, and provided evidence for their prevention. Setting: The study {{was carried out in}} a postnatal ward in a secondary health facility. Methods: This was a case-control study involving booked and unbooked pregnant women who had delivered. Consecutive enrolment of all unbooked pregnant women (cases) was done, and one booked pregnant woman (control) was enrolled and matched for age with each of these. Both groups were interviewed using a questionnaire, whilst records of delivery were extracted from the hospital files. Findings were subjected to logistical regression at a significance level of p < 0. 05. Results: Booked women had a lower median length of labour (10 hours) compared to unbooked women (13 hours). More women in the booked control group (139; 35. 1 %) than in the unbooked case group (96; 23. 6 %) reported at least one type of morbidity during the index pregnancy (p = 0. 0004). <b>Booking</b> <b>status</b> was associated with a likelihood of spontaneous vaginal delivery. Young maternal age, low education, rural residence and low socio-economic status were associated with less likelihood of using prenatal services. Young maternal age, low education and intervention in the delivery were associated with a likelihood of experiencing a complication of delivery. Conclusion: Strengthening antenatal and secondary healthcare services as short- and mediumterm measures might be cost-effective as a preventive strategy in complications of pregnancy,whilst socio-economic dimensions of health are accorded priority in the long term. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the maternal and fetal outcome of teenage pregnancy and find the effect of antenatal care on these teen mothers. Methods: A retrospective case study was performed over a period of three years. Data was retrieved from the hospital record. All teenage mothers (aged less than 19 years) delivering in the hospital were taken as cases. Consecutive two deliveries in the age group of 20 to 30 years meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were taken as control group. Various aspects of pregnancy outcome was recorded and analyzed. Results: The incidence of teenage pregnancy over the three years of study period was 4. 33 %. The occurrence of hypertensive disorders 32 (9. 4 %) vs 36 (5. 3 %), p value < 0. 01; IUGR 23 (6. 7 %) vs 11 (1. 6 %), p value < 0. 01; preterm delivery 38 (11. 2 %) vs 18 (2. 6 %) p value < 0. 01; and full term normal delivery 258 (75. 9 %) vs 563 (82. 7 %), (p value < 0. 01 in the study group and control group respectively. Low birth weight babies 140 (41. 2 %) vs 63 (9. 3 %), p value < 0. 01 and NICU admission 20 (5. 8 %) vs 9 (1. 3 %), p value < 0. 01; were significantly higher in the study group. The comparison of various pregnancy outcomes according to the <b>booking</b> <b>status</b> of the teenage mothers finds significant improvement in most of the parameters in those who received adequate antenatal care. Conclusion: The pregnancy outcome of teenage mothers is poorer in comparison to 20 to 30 years age group in most of the parameters. Adequate antenatal care reduces the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcome significantly in the teen mothers. [Int J Reprod Contracept Obstet Gynecol 2013; 2 (3. 000) : 383 - 387...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Haemorrhage from obstetric causes is {{the most}} common cause of {{maternal}} mortality in the developing world. Prevention of mortality from haemorrhage will necessarily involve prompt blood transfusions among other life saving measures. There are however limited stocks of fresh or stored blood in many health care facilities in Sub Saharan Africa. Caesarean section has been identified as a common indication for blood transfusion in obstetrics practice and its performance is often delayed by non availability of blood in our centre. An evaluation of blood reservation and use at caesarean sections in a tertiary maternity unit in Lagos, south western Nigeria should therefore assist in formulating the most rational blood transfusion policies. Methods Case records of 327 patients who had elective and emergency caesarian sections at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital between 1 st October and 31 st December 2007 were reviewed. Data pertaining to age, parity, <b>booking</b> <b>status,</b> type and indication for Caesarean section, pre- and post-operative packed cell volume, blood loss at surgery, units of blood reserved in the blood bank, unit(s) of blood transfused and duration of hospital stay was extracted and the data analysed. Results There were 1056 deliveries out of which 327 (31 %) were by Caesarean section. During the study period, a total of 654 units of blood were reserved in the blood bank and subsequently made available in theatre. Out of this number, only 89 (13. 6 %) were transfused to 41 patients. Amongst those transfused, twenty-six (54 %) were booked and 31 (75. 6 %) had primary caesarian section. About 81 % of those transfused had emergency caesarean section. The most common indication for surgery among those transfused were placenta praevia (9 patients with 21 units of blood) and cephalo-pelvic disproportion (8 patients with 13 units). Conclusion Even though a large number of units of blood was reserved and made available in the theatre at the time of operation, majority of the patients operated did not need blood transfusion. Provision of a mini- blood bank within the obstetric unit and careful patient categorization will ensure timely availability of blood for surgery without necessarily tying down stock in the central blood bank. </p...|$|E

This study aimed to determine the twinning rate, and maternal and fetal outcomes of all twin pregnancies managed at the Niger Delta University Teaching Hospital Okolobiri. Methods: The study is a 4 -year descriptive retrospective evaluation of twin pregnancies managed at the Niger Delta University Teaching Hospital Okolobiri. Records of all pregnancies, booked and unbooked, managed from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2010 were reviewed. Details of delivery and maternal and fetal outcomes were obtained using a pro forma designed for the study. Epi Info version 3. 5. 3 was used for statistical analysis. The Chi-square test was used to test for associations between variables. The level of significance was set at P &le; 0. 05. Results: A total of 1341 deliveries including 41 cases of twin deliveries were recorded during the study period, giving an incidence of 30. 6 / 1000. Twenty-nine (70. 7 %) of the patients were unbooked. The mean gestational age was 33. 3 &plusmn; 2. 6 weeks, and the mean fetal weight was 2. 34 &plusmn; 0. 54 kg. There were 13 perinatal deaths, with a perinatal mortality rate of 158. 5 / 1000. There was no association between <b>booking</b> <b>status</b> and perinatal mortality rate (&chi; 2 = 0. 017, P = 1. 000). Prematurity was the chief cause of perinatal death (65. 4 %). Maternal morbidities included anemia, wound infection, and genital sepsis. There were no maternal deaths. Conclusion: The twinning rate was high. There was a high perinatal mortality rate, with prematurity accounting for most of the mortality. There is a need for improved incubation/neonatal care for better outcomes with twin pregnancies in the hospital. Keywords: twin pregnancy, Niger Delta, maternal outcome, perinatal outcom...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to review the}} caesarean section rate and perinatal mortality in Federal Medical Centre, Birnin Kudu from 1 st January 2010 to 31 st December, 2012. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study involving review of 580 case files. Ethical clearance was obtained. The records of labour ward, neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) and operating theatre were use. Information extracted includes age, parity, <b>booking</b> <b>status,</b> total deliveries, indications for caesarean section and perinatal outcome from 1 st January 2010 to 31 st December 2012 at Federal Medical Centre, Birnin Kudu. The data obtained was analysed using SPSS version 17. 0 statistical software (Chicago, Il, USA). Absolute numbers and simple percentages were used to describe categorical variables. Association between caesarean section and perinatal mortality was determined using Pearson′s Coefficient of correlation and student t- test. P - value < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Result: This study reported a caesarean section rate of 17. 69 % and a perinatal mortality rate of 165. 6 per 1000. Majority of the babies (78. 2 %) were within normal weight. The {{mean age of the}} women was 25. 9 ± 6. 2 years and mean parity was 4 ± 3. Majority of them were uneducated and unemployed. Obstructed labour was the commonest indication for emergency caesarean section accounting for 31. 7 % of caesarean sections and foetal distress was the least at 2. 6 %. Two or more previous caesarean section was the commonest indication for elective caesarean section (17. 1 %) and bad obstetrics history the least indication (1. 4 %). There is a weak positive correlation (r = 0. 35) between caesarean section rate and perinatal mortality and this association was not statistically significant (P = 0. 12). Conclusion: Caesarean section and perinatal mortality rates in the present study are comparatively high. Absence of significant correlation means that a high caesarean section rate is not likely to improve perinatal outcomes in babies of normal weight; therefore the caesarean section rate in this centre should be reduced. Measures to reduce perinatal mortality such as skilled attendant in labour and training of medical staff in neonatal resuscitation should be adopted...|$|E
40|$|In Nigeria, over 900, 000 {{children}} under the age of five years die every year. Early neonatal death is responsible for a little over 20 % of these deaths. Prematurity remains a significant cause of these early neonatal deaths. In some series, it is reported to be responsible for 60 - 70 % of these deaths. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and determinants of pre-term deliveries at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Ilorin. This was a prospective cohort study conducted over a 9 -month period at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital. Records of deliveries and data on maternal socio-biological and antenatal variables were collected during this period in order to determine the prevalence and determinants of pre-term deliveries. Out of the 2, 489 deliveries that took place over a 9 -month period, there were 293 pre-terms, giving a pre-term delivery rate of 120 per 1, 000 deliveries. Of the total deliveries, 1, 522 singleton deliveries that satisfied inclusion criteria were recruited; 185 of them were pre-term deliveries giving a case:control ratio of 1 : 7. Significant determinants of pre-term delivery identified were previous pre-term delivery (P= 0. 001; OR= 3. 55; 95 % CI= 1. 71 - 7. 30), antepartum hemorrhage (P= 0. 000; OR= 8. 95; 95 %CI= 4. 06 - 19. 78), premature rupture of the membranes (P= 0. 000; OR= 6. 48; 95 %CI= 4. 33 - 9. 67), maternal urinary tract infection (P= 0. 006; OR= 5. 89; 95 %CI= 1. 16 - 27. 57), pregnancy induced hypertension (P= 0. 007; OR= 3. 23; 95 %CI= 2. 09 - 4. 99), type of labor (P= 0. 000; OR= 6. 44; 95 %CI= 4. 42 - 9. 38) and <b>booking</b> <b>status</b> (P= 0. 000; OR= 4. 67; 95 %CI= 3. 33 - 6. 56). The prevalence of pre-term delivery was 120 per 1, 000 live births. Factors significantly associated with pre-term delivery were low socio-economic class, previous preterm delivery, antepartum hemorrhage, premature rupture of fetal membranes, urinary tract infection, pregnancy induced hypertension, induced labor, and booking elsewhere outside the teaching hospital...|$|E

Background: Although the {{prevalence}} of pneumonia in pregnancy {{is reported to be}} less than 1 %, the pregnant state and risk factors associated with the development of pneumonia adversely influence the outcome of pregnancy. KwaZulu-Natal is at the epicenter of the dual epidemics of tuberculosis and HIV- 1 and the impact of these diseases occurring concurrently in pregnant women at King Edward VIII hospital (KEH), South Africa have been described previously. The impact of antenatal pneumonia in HIV- 1 infected and uninfected women however has not been described in the study population and was investigated. Methods: Pregnant women with clinical and radiological evidence of pneumonia were recruited from the antenatal clinic and labour ward at KEH. The study was conducted prospectively between January and December 2000. The clinical profile of these women and the causative organisms were determined. In addition the impact of HIV- 1 infection, maternal immunosuppression and maternal pneumonia on obstetric and perinatal outcomes were evaluated. Mothers diagnosed with tuberculosis and multi drug resistant tuberculosis were hospitalised at King George V hospital until delivery. Results: Twenty nine women were diagnosed with antenatal pneumonia (study arm) with Mycobacterium tuberculosis the only causative organism isolated. A control arm of 112 pregnant women was also studied. Maternal and perinatal mortality was restricted to the study arm with a maternal mortality ratio of 99 per 100 000 live births and a perinatal mortality rate of 240 per 1000 births. Pneumonia was significantly associated with a negative overall obstetric outcome in the presence of HIV- l infection, antenatal care, anaemia and second trimester <b>booking</b> <b>status.</b> In addition, the presence of pneumonia was significantly associated with maternal mortality. There was a highly significant association between exposure to pneumonia and poor neonatal outcome. Maternal pneumonia, maternal HIV infection and the presence of medical and obstetric conditions were significantly associated with low birth weight and neonatal pneumonia. Further, maternal pneumonia (p < 0. 001) and concurrent HIV infection (p= 0. 002) was significantly associated with neonatal death. Conclusion: The presence of pneumonia in the antenatal period impacts negatively on maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Health care providers must maintain a high degree of suspicion when managing a pregnant woman with unresolving upper respiratory tract symptoms and refer timeously for further investigation. Pneumonia and in particular pulmonary tuberculosis associated with HIV co- infection in pregnancy is a threat to mother and baby. Therefore in areas endemic for TB and HIV infection, it may be prudent to screen HIV positive pregnant women for symptoms suggestive of pneumonia and thereby identify women requiring further investigations such as sputummicroscopy and cultures, and a screening chest radiograph...|$|E
