5|$|A typical {{structure}} {{would have}} {{four or more}} central posts planted {{in the ground and}} connected at the top by cross beams. The smoke hole would be left open in the center. Around the central structure there was a larger ring of shorter posts, also connected by cross beams. Rafters radiated from the central cross beams to the outside cross <b>beams,</b> <b>and</b> then split planks or beams formed the slanting or vertical side walls.|$|E

50|$|Still {{struggling}} with injuries, Porgras {{was a member}} of the team at the 2010 European Championships. She helped the team qualify in second place by competing on balance <b>beam</b> <b>and</b> uneven bars. Individually, she qualified first on <b>beam</b> <b>and</b> seventh on bars. She helped her team win the bronze medal by earning the top mark of the day on <b>beam</b> (14.800) <b>and</b> by scoring 13.700 on uneven bars. During the team finals, Porgras suffered an injury from her balance beam dismount, which forced her to withdraw from the <b>beam</b> <b>and</b> uneven bars finals. After her return to Romania, she was diagnosed with a crack in her right fibula. In September she made a successful comeback at the Ghent World Cup, winning the gold medal on balance <b>beam</b> <b>and</b> a silver medal on uneven bars.

5|$|Architecture {{during the}} Song period reached new heights of sophistication. Authors such as Yu Hao and Shen Kuo wrote books {{outlining}} {{the field of}} architectural layouts, craftsmanship, and structural engineering in the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively. Shen Kuo preserved the written dialogues of Yu Hao when describing technical issues such as slanting struts built into pagoda towers for diagonal wind bracing. Shen Kuo also preserved Yu's specified dimensions and units of measurement for various building types. The architect Li Jie (1065–1110), who published the Yingzao Fashi ('Treatise on Architectural Methods') in 1103, greatly expanded upon the works of Yu Hao and compiled the standard building codes used by the central government agencies and by craftsmen throughout the empire. He addressed the standard methods of construction, design, and applications of moats and fortifications, stonework, greater woodwork, lesser woodwork, wood-carving, turning and drilling, sawing, bamboo work, tiling, wall building, painting and decoration, brickwork, glazed tile making, and provided proportions for mortar formulas in masonry. In his book, Li provided detailed and vivid illustrations of architectural components and cross-sections of buildings. These illustrations displayed various applications of corbel brackets, cantilever arms, mortise and tenon work of tie <b>beams</b> <b>and</b> cross <b>beams,</b> <b>and</b> diagrams showing the various building types of halls in graded sizes. He also outlined the standard units of measurement and standard dimensional measurements of all building components described and illustrated in his book.|$|E
5|$|As {{the tunnels}} were constructed, they were {{generally}} supported by wooden <b>beams</b> <b>and</b> posts. Once the mine had been finished, the internal space {{was filled with}} combustibles, such as brushwood, firewood, resin, and other incendiary substances; once ignited, these would burn the supporting props, causing the mine to collapse, bringing down with it the structures lying above. From the 15th century, gunpowder was also used, although the aim remained to burn the props.|$|E
5|$|By February 26 city {{officials}} had determined One Meridian Plaza {{was not in}} danger of collapse. There was structural damage to horizontal steel <b>beams</b> <b>and</b> floor sections {{on most of the}} fire damaged floors. Under extreme fire exposure the <b>beams</b> <b>and</b> girders sagged and twisted and cracks appeared in the concrete floors. However, the overall structure was stable and able to support the weight of the building. Thermal expansion of the steel frame caused some of the granite panels to be dislodged from the building's facade. The streets and buildings around One Meridian Plaza were closed and cordoned off. The 20-story Morris Building and several three-story shops behind One Meridian Plaza on Chestnut Street were damaged by falling debris and sat unused for years until they were demolished in 2000. The neighboring Girard Trust Building, then called Two Mellon Plaza, experienced extensive water damage forcing the closure of the building. A bank in the building reopened a month later {{but the rest of the}} tower remained vacant for years. The roads around the building were closed for months after the fire, including a portion of two of Philadelphia's major streets, Broad and Market.|$|E

She qualified second to the all-around final, fourth on bars, seventh on <b>beam,</b> <b>and</b> fifth on floor. Russia qualified to the team final in third place, behind the United States and China. In the team final, Mustafina contributed a 15.133 on vault, 15.066 on bars, 14.766 on <b>beam,</b> <b>and</b> 14.033 on floor to Russia's third-place finish. In the all-around final, she finished fourth with a total score of 57.915, performing well on vault and bars but making mistakes on <b>beam</b> <b>and</b> floor. She would later state that a fever was the cause of her poor performance. In the uneven bars final, she finished in sixth place with a score of 15.100. She then won bronze medals in the balance <b>beam</b> <b>and</b> floor exercise finals, scoring 14.166 on <b>beam</b> <b>and</b> 14.733 on floor to beat out Asuka Teramoto of Japan and MyKayla Skinner of the United States. This made her the ninth-most decorated female artistic gymnast at the World Championships, with a total of 11 medals.|$|R
30|$|To ensure {{adequate}} {{load transfer}} between the <b>beam</b> <b>and</b> stubs, 50  mm deep rectangular shear keys were crafted at the <b>beam</b> ends, <b>and</b> “U”-shaped reinforcement was also added at the interfaces between the <b>beam</b> <b>and</b> stubs (Fig.  2). To prevent the stubs from being damaged, {{they were built}} using concrete of a compressive strength of 60  MPa and sufficient reinforcement.|$|R
5|$|During {{his stay}} in Jerusalem, Umar {{was led by}} Sophronius to various holy sites, {{including}} the Temple Mount. Seeing the poor state of where the Temple once stood, Umar ordered the area cleared of refuse and debris before having a wooden mosque built on the site. The earliest account of such a structure is given by the Gallic bishop Arculf, who visited Jerusalem between 679 and 682, and describes a very primitive house of prayer able to accommodate up to 3,000 worshippers, constructed of wooden <b>beams</b> <b>and</b> boards over pre-existing ruins.|$|E
5|$|Newton House {{fell into}} a {{turbulent}} period {{after the death of}} the 7th Baron Dynevor in 1956. His son Charles Arthur Uryan, the 8th Baron, died just six years later, and most of the estate and a number of family's assets had to be sold off to pay duties. In 1974, the property was sold by the current Baron Dynevor, and later fell into disrepair: it was occupied by squatters and thieves who removed <b>beams</b> <b>and</b> furniture. The house, along with Dinefwr Castle, have since been restored by Cadw and the National Trust respectively. The National Trust acquired the deer park in 1987 and Newton House three years later.|$|E

Although the intersection beam makes the panel zone rigid, the degree of rigidity depends on the scale of the intersection <b>beam</b> <b>and</b> the shear-span ratios of <b>beam</b> <b>and</b> column, respectivery. Accordingly, the object of this paper is to make clear the relations between the scale of intersection <b>beam</b> <b>and</b> the rigidity of the panel zone.
