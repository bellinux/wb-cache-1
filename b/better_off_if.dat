5|$|Victor Fresco, the show's creator, has cited {{his being}} a new parent as {{inspiration}} for the show. In an interview with NPR, he discussed how having a kid piqued his interest to develop a show about the disconnection between a person's public and personal lives, such as how parents teach their kids to be moral, yet work for giant corporations. According to Fresco, Ted Crisp is the single father and his daughter serves as his moral compass. Fresco stated that since he's worked for a few giant companies, he didn't base Veridian Dynamics on any specific corporation. The show's name {{was based on the}} idea that a person is <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> they are Ted, that essentially the average person wants to be Ted. Fresco has stated that he wasn't a fan of the show's title, but hadn't spoken of changing it.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} decision spurred local campaigning {{to establish a}} permanent base in Agder. They argued that Stavanger and Oslo were {{too far away to}} give an adequate coverage of Agder and Telemark. The activism increased rapidly in 1990. Two petitions were established, the one gathering 33,000 signatures. A common petition was written and signed by both county councils, 34 mayors and various organizations. There was also some opposition, based on that the ambulance service would in total be <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> the extra funding was used on strengthening the conventional ambulance service.|$|E
25|$|In {{the rest}} of the book Ehrlich {{discusses}} things which readers can do to help. This is focused primarily on changing public opinion to create pressure on politicians to enact the policies he suggests, which he believed were not politically possible in 1968. At {{the end of the book}} he discusses the possibility that his forecasts may be wrong, a fact which he felt he must acknowledge as a scientist. However, he believes that humanity will only be <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> it follows his prescriptions, so that even if he is incorrect it is the right course of action.|$|E

30|$|The first {{question}} conjures up a prisoners’ dilemma (Noll, 2003). States are <b>better</b> <b>off</b> collectively <b>if</b> each contributes a fair share, {{but they are}} <b>better</b> <b>off</b> individually <b>if</b> they can pass on the buck to others. Prisoners’ dilemmas can often be solved if the same players have to play with each other repeatedly and if {{they also have to}} play different kinds of games. Non-cooperative players that dominate one game can then be sanctioned in another one. If they are aware of this, they may play cooperatively from the start. Prisoners’ dilemmas can even be avoided altogether if players agree ex ante on coordinating their actions.|$|R

25|$|With Nanda, Indjejikian {{argues that}} {{incentive}} problems are a crucial aspect of responsibility accounting. Due to the Ratchet effect, the employer would be <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> both parties {{can agree on}} a multi-period contract without subsequent revisions. Two responsibility center structures are analyzed: Consolidated structures are produced when managers are attributed to multiple activities. These structures imply less ratcheting but {{at the loss of}} comparative performance information. Specialized structures mean managers are responsible for one activity thus providing a higher level of comparative performance information but also a higher level of ratcheting. Performance evaluation in firms with specialized structures is more informative because of the use of comparative measurements.|$|E
25|$|Claire {{lives with}} Agnes and Tobias {{and appears to}} have no means of support except for them. Her main role in life {{seems to be to}} annoy and embarrass her sister. She is {{everything}} that Agnes dislikes. Claire makes the statement, after telling Tobias that he would be <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> he killed Agnes, Julia, and herself, that she will never know whether she wants to live until Agnes is dead. With this statement, Albee makes it sound as if Claire holds Agnes up as a role model, a model that she has never been able to reach. And instead of trying to reach it, she has done everything to live her life in a diametrically opposed manner.|$|E
25|$|Domitius was Consul in 32 and {{appointed}} by Tiberius as a commissioner in early 37. His son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, later Emperor Nero, {{was born on}} 15 December 37 in Antium. According to Suetonius, when Domitius was congratulated by his friends {{for the birth of}} his son he replied that any child born to him and Agrippina would have a detestable nature and become a public danger, a fact that became true during the second part of Nero's reign. When Nero castrated a boy named Sporus and married him as a wife, Suetonius quoted one Roman who lived around this time who remarked that the world would have been <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> Nero's father had married someone more like the castrated boy.|$|E

25|$|Pope Callixtus III took King Thomas very seriously: {{he ordered}} that the King of Bosnia be handed the Crusaders' cross, the papal flag and the crusading fund, marking {{him as the}} leader of the {{coalition}} in July 1457. Thomas relied not on his own dubious strength, however, but on assistance of Western rulers. His emissaries to King Alfonso V of Aragon, Doge Francesco Foscari of Venice, Duke Francesco I Sforza of Milan, and Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy all reported refusals of help. Cardinal Carvajal was sent to Bosnia to meet with King Thomas. Cardinal Giovanni Castiglione skeptically wrote that Carvajal would have been <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> he had stayed in Buda. Indeed, Carvajal found Thomas ill-equipped to deal with the enemy. The Pope became disillusioned with him, and the leadership of the Christian coalition was transferred to the Albanian lord Skanderbeg.|$|E
25|$|Shares in Eurotunnel {{were issued}} at £3.50 per share on 9 December 1987. By mid-1989 the price {{had risen to}} £11.00. Delays and cost overruns led to the price dropping; during {{demonstration}} runs in October 1994 it reached an all-time low. Eurotunnel suspended payment on its debt in September 1995 to avoid bankruptcy. In December 1997 the British and French governments extended Eurotunnel's operating concession by 34years, to 2086. Financial restructuring of Eurotunnel occurred in mid-1998, reducing debt and financial charges. Despite the restructuring, The Economist reported in 1998 that to break even Eurotunnel would have to increase fares, traffic and market share for sustainability. A cost benefit analysis of the tunnel indicated that there were few impacts on the wider economy and few developments associated with the project, and that the British economy would have been <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> {{it had not been}} constructed.|$|E

As he departs Detroit on a bus, he angrily remarks to Homer that he would have been <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> he never met him and that as far as he is concerned, he has no brother. While Marge tries to console Homer, Lisa agrees with Herb and laments on his life before he discovered he was a [...] "Simpson". Grampa soon arrives and asks about Herb.

Notwithstanding claims {{that the world would}} be <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> most adopted a single common lingua franca, such as English or Esperanto, there is a consensus that the loss of languages harms the cultural diversity of the world. It is a common belief, going back to the biblical narrative of the tower of Babel in the Old Testament, that linguistic diversity causes political conflict, but this is contradicted by {{the fact that many of}} the world's major episodes of violence have taken place in situations with low linguistic diversity, such as the Yugoslav and American Civil War, or the genocide of Rwanda, whereas many of the most stable political units have been highly multilingual.|$|E
500|$|Academic Eliot A. Cohen, {{professor}} of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University wrote for The Washington Post that the British Army had [...] "a higher quotient of sophisticated {{leaders who have}} thought hard about the profession of arms" [...] than was found in other armed forces, including the US military, which he believed explained why it [...] "produces generals who write [...] serious, important books" [...] such as the Utility of Force. Cohen wrote that Smith's thesis, {{that the world has}} entered a new era of conflict, is of [...] "central importance" [...] for the United States military, which Cohen believed would have to undergo significant adaptation if Smith was correct. Cohen criticised the book for its limited historical perspective, noting that conventional wars are still fought (for example the Kargil War in 1999) and that several confrontations in Asia threatened to spill over into conventional warfare. Nevertheless, Cohen concluded [...] "Smith has clearly written {{one of the most important}} books on modern warfare in the last decade.

[...] While the Prisoner's dilemma has only two strategies (Cooperate and Defect), the iterated Prisoner's dilemma has a huge number of possible strategies.

He had once called the Eisenhower administration [...] "a dime-store New Deal", and the former president never fully forgave him. Eisenhower did, however, film a television commercial with Goldwater. Eisenhower qualified his voting for Goldwater in November by remarking that he had voted not specifically for Goldwater, but for the Republican Party. In December 1961, Goldwater had told a news conference that [...] "sometimes I think this country would be <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> we could just saw off the Eastern Seaboard and let it float out to sea".
