5|$|Alloys of zinc {{with small}} amounts of copper, aluminium, and {{magnesium}} are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. An {{example of this is}} zinc aluminium. The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium, and is reported to <b>be</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement.|$|E
5|$|The {{proximity}} fuze {{had been}} pioneered by Alan Butement. The {{idea was that}} if a shell could explode when it was near an enemy aircraft, a near miss would <b>be</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> effective as a direct hit. The technical problem was to miniaturise a radar set, and make it sturdy enough to be fired from a gun barrel. The second problem had been solved by the Germans; a dud German bomb was salvaged that had valves that could withstand the acceleration. Plans {{were given to the}} Americans by the Tizard Mission, but work continued in Britain, where a team was established at Christchurch under Charles Drummond Ellis in February 1942. Work proceeded fitfully, and by 1943, production was still two years away. On a visit to the United States in November 1943, Cockcroft discussed adapting the American proximity fuze for British use with Merle Tuve. As a result, 150,000 fuzes for QF 3.7-inch AA guns were ordered on 16 January 1944. The fuzes arrived in time to engage the V-1 flying bombs in August 1944, shooting down 97 per cent of them. For his services, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in June 1944.|$|E

25|$|A {{proposition}} {{was made}} by me that since our books were often referr'd to in our disquisitions upon the inquiries, it might be convenient {{for us to have}} them altogether where we met, that upon occasion they might be consulted; and by thus clubbing our books to a common library, we should, while we lik'd to keep them together, have each of us the advantage of using the books of all the other members, which would <b>be</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> beneficial as if each owned the whole.|$|E
25|$|The term homoeologous, also spelled homeologous, {{is used to}} {{describe}} the relationship of similar chromosomes or parts of chromosomes brought together following inter-species hybridization and allopolyploidization, and whose relationship was completely homologous in an ancestral species. In allopolyploids, the homologous chromosomes within each parental sub-genome should pair faithfully during meiosis, leading to disomic inheritance; however in some allopolyploids, the homoeologous chromosomes of the parental genomes may <b>be</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> similar to one another as the homologous chromosomes, leading to tetrasomic inheritance (four chromosomes pairing at meiosis), intergenomic recombination, and reduced fertility.|$|E

25|$|Recruitment is {{the number}} of new young fish that enter a {{population}} in a given year. The size of fish populations can fluctuate by orders of magnitude over time, and five to 10-fold variations in abundance are usual. This variability applies across time spans ranging from a year to hundreds of years. Year to year fluctuations in the abundance of short lived forage fish can <b>be</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> great as the fluctuations that occur over decades or centuries. This suggests that fluctuations in reproductive and recruitment success are prime factors behind fluctuations in abundance. Annual fluctuations often seem random, and recruitment success often has a poor relationship to adult stock levels and fishing effort. This makes prediction difficult.|$|E
25|$|Like black widows, {{the female}} S. grossa is 6-10.5mm {{in length and}} dark colored with a round, bulbous abdomen. Typical {{coloration}} ranges from purplish brown to black, with light-colored markings. Unlike black widows, redbacks, and other Latrodectus species, S. grossa {{does not have a}} bright red hourglass pattern or any other bright markings. Like many spiders, the male is sometimes smaller but can many times <b>be</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> long as the females. It measures 4.1-10.0mm in length and is thinner than the female. The two sexes are colored similarly; however, the sexually mature male almost always has lighter, more reddish-coloured legs than the female. S. grossa spiders may shed up to six times (instars) before reaching maturity. They can go several months without feeding, provided they have access to water. A well-fed female can lay three or more egg sacs each year. Each egg sac typically contains between 40-100 eggs. The mother can often be observed watching her eggs for hours, even days, at a time once the eggs start changing color and grow close to hatching. At normal household temp/humidity, an egg will usually hatch within a month of being laid. The spiderlings are independent from time of hatch.|$|E

The song was also performed in a similar manner on the October9, 2010 episode of Saturday Night Live, as part of a segue from [...] "Nothin' on You", the debut single was also performed. His performance was well received by critics. Billboards magazine critique Walter Frazier analysed the performance and commented [...] "Mars' backing band...dressed as a 1950s rockabilly group, while Mars resembled something of a modern-day Elvis, surely inspiring swoons for the [...] "SNL" [...] audience." [...] The performance was also praised by Mawuse Ziegbe, MTV reviewer, who wrote: [...] "Mars peppered the performance with hip-swaying moves Elvis would be proud of and wrapped up the set in classic rock-star style with an enthusiastic jump in the air." [...] On October 21, 2010, a soulful arrangement of the song was sung for a Billboard Tastemakers video session. On May 5, 2011 Mars expressed his apprehension about performing the song because fans have been throwing dummy grenades on stage, some of which are metal and have posed a safety hazard.|$|E
500|$|Not all {{critics were}} {{impressed}} with the album. Blabbermouth.net reviewer Borivoj Krgin dismissively labeled the album as [...] "another failure on the band's part {{to take the initiative}} and reinvent themselves." [...] Krgin described King as [...] "the weaker and less inventive of the two main songwriters" [...] (King and Hanneman), feeling the album followed [...] "a familiar direction that almost always sounds tired and forced" [...] as a result of King being the album's main songwriter. Krgin also singled out Araya for criticism, and called the vocalist a [...] "hollow shell of his former self, boasting a singing style that is monotonous, devoid of creativity and at times virtually unlistenable." [...] Krgin awarded the record 6 out of 10, and ended the review by observing that [...] "Slayer's rapidly diminishing record sales (Diabolus In Musica has shifted less than 300,000 copies in the US compared to 600–700,000+) as a sign that the band is in dire need of a new lease on life." [...] The Washington Post gave it a mixed review, stating, [...] "Of course, what Slayer says isn't supposed to <b>be</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> important as how it says it: The riffs are all overdriven and suffocating, and that's a conscious decision. In its simplest form, a song like [...] "Exile" [...] could pass for Motorhead pushed through the blades of a lawn mower, but that's selling Slayer short; guitarist Kerry King actively fights the groove that naturally comes from playing heavy rock-and-roll." ...|$|E

TV Squad's Michael Sciannamea said that [...] "The Injury" [...] was [...] "another solid episode" [...] and that the [...] "show gets better with each and every week." [...] M.
