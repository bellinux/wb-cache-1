40|$|We {{study the}} motion of a uniform thin rod {{released}} from rest, with the <b>bottom</b> <b>end</b> initially in contact with a horizontal surface. Our focus here is {{the motion of}} the <b>bottom</b> <b>end</b> as the rod falls. For small angles of release with respect to the horizontal, the rod falls without the <b>bottom</b> <b>end</b> slipping. For larger angles, the slipping direction depends on the static friction coefficient between the rod and the horizontal surface. Small friction coefficients cause the end to slip initially in one direction and then in the other, while for high coefficients, the end slips in one direction only. For intermediate values, depending on the angle of release, both situations can occur. We find the initial slipping direction to depend on a relation between the angle at which the rod slips, and a critical angle at which the frictional force vanishes. Comparison between experimental data and numerical simulations shows good agreement. (C) 2016 American Association of Physics Teachers. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} on the fluid dynamic characteristics of the <b>bottom</b> <b>end</b> piece of a nuclear fuel assembly. A commercial CFD code was used to simulate water flows through perforated plates in a square duct to evaluate both turbulence models and mesh refinement. Perforated plates with different diameter holes and one similar to the plate of the <b>bottom</b> <b>end</b> piece were simulated. The numerical results with the optimized mesh and SST k-ω turbulence model showed a good agreement when compared with a conventional methodology (Idelchik). With the same mesh criteria and the SST k-ω turbulence model were accomplished simulations in a standard <b>bottom</b> <b>end</b> piece, with some geometric simplifications. Experiments were also carried out to determine the pressure drop through the <b>bottom</b> <b>end</b> piece. The agreement between the numerical simulations and experimental results can be considered satisfactory but suggests further numerical investigations with bottom piece under real conditions of the experiment, without the geometric simplifications and with a gap between the piece and the wall of the flow channel. Additionally, other turbulence models should be appraised for this complex geometry.
