40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Four new compounds, randainins A−D (1 − 4), were {{isolated}} from the leaves and twigs of Callicarpa randaiensis, which is an endemic species in Taiwan. Compounds 1 and 2 are diterpenoids with an unusual trans- 7 / 5 ring system, whereas compounds 3 and 4 are diterpenoids possessing a trans- 5 / 7 ring scaffold. The structures of the new compounds were established based on NMR and MS data analyses. Anti-inflammatory activities and cytotoxicity were tested and evaluated for these compounds. Compound 4 exhibited moderate inhibition of superoxide-anion generation with an IC 50 value of 21. 5 ± 2. 5 μM. Plants that belong to the genus Callicarpa (familyVerbenaceae) are shrubs native to Southeast Asia and include 190 species worldwide. A few species of Callicarpa (<b>beautyberries)</b> are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat coughing, arthritis, bleeding, and abdominal pain. 1 The secondary metabolites of <b>beautyberries</b> {{have been reported to}} comprise terpenoids, 2 − 4 lignans, 5 glycosides, 6 and flavonoids. ...|$|R
