40|$|Abstract. Balanced gates are an {{effective}} countermeasure against power analysis attacks {{only if they}} can be guaranteed to maintain their power balance. Traditional testing and reliability methods are used primarily only to ensure the correctness of the logical functionality and not the balance of a circuit. Due to the hardware redundancy in <b>balanced</b> <b>gate</b> designs, there are many faults which can imbalance a <b>balanced</b> <b>gate</b> without causing logical errors. As a result, traditional testing and reliability methods and architectures are unable to test and verify if a gate is completely defect and fault-free and hence balanced. Our simulations show that a few faulty balanced gates can make a circuit as vulnerable to power analysis attacks as a completely imbalanced implementation. This vulnerability opens the possibility of new methods of attacks based on a combination of fault and power attacks. A solution to the vulnerability based on a built-in differential self-balance comparator is presented. ...|$|E

One of the major obstacles is a <b>balancing</b> of <b>gates</b> and runners in a family mold due to lack of clear understanding of the flow behavior of plastic in the mold resulting in overpacking,short shot or any other defects on the parts.

Compared to conventional dual-rail protocols, it halves the number of bus wires and, according to simulations, significantly reduces energy consumption with small throughput loss and nearly no area overhead. 1. Introduction As feature size of CMOS technology decreases, the <b>balance</b> between <b>gate</b> and wire delays is going worse, with wiring delays moving into dominance. The dominant wire delay causes many troubles in synchronous designs: since wire delays depend on the final physical design, the system performance strongly depends on physical implementation, so many design cycles are needed to obtain a correct circuit. Delay-insensitive asynchronous communication can simplify design, reducing sensitivity to circuit delays; nevertheless, conventional delay-insensitive techniques (i. e. dual-rail coding) are expensive in terms of energy [1] [...] ...|$|R

N/PBTI-induced degrada-tion depends heavily on workload, which causes imbalanced degradation and additional clock skew for clock distribution networks with clock gating features. In this work, we first analyze the effects of N/PBTI on clock paths with different clock gating use cases. Then cross-layer solutions are proposed to reduce N/PBTI-induced clock skew. Two Integrated Clock Gating (ICG) cell circuits are proposed to alternate clock idle state between logic high and logic low for each clock gating operation. A skew mitigation methodology is also proposed to select the appropriate ICG cells based on the architecture and microarchitecture context. An example of sleep scheduling is also described as a simple software-level technique that can be used in conjunction with BTI-Gater to avoid certain pathological aging scenarios.

40|$|Although {{the muscle}} nicotinic {{receptor}} (AChR) desensitizes almost {{completely in the}} steady presence of high concentrations of acetylcholine (ACh), it is well established that AChRs do not accumulate in desensitized states under normal physiological conditions of neurotransmitter release and clearance. Quantitative considerations {{in the framework of}} plausible kinetic schemes, however, lead us to predict that mutations that speed up channel opening, slow down channel closure, and/or slow down the dissociation of neurotransmitter (i. e., gain-of-function mutations) increase the extent to which AChRs desensitize upon ACh removal. In this paper, we confirm this prediction by applying high-frequency trains of brief (∼ 1 ms) ACh pulses to outside-out membrane patches expressing either lab-engineered or naturally occurring (disease-causing) gain-of-function mutants. Entry into desensitization was evident in our experiments as a frequency-dependent depression in the peak value of succesive macroscopic current responses, {{in a manner that is}} remarkably consistent with the theoretical expectation. We conclude that the comparatively small depression of the macroscopic currents observed upon repetitive stimulation of the wild-type AChR is due, not to desensitization being exceedingly slow but, rather, to the particular <b>balance</b> between <b>gating,</b> entry into desensitization, and ACh dissociation rate constants. Disruption of this fine balance by, for example, mutations can lead to enhanced desensitization even if the kinetics of entry into, and recovery from, desensitization themselves are not affected. It follows that accounting for the (usually overlooked) desensitization phenomenon is essential for the correct interpretation of mutagenesis-driven structure–function relationships and for the understanding of pathological synaptic transmission at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction...|$|R

Munc 13 - 3 null mutant (Munc 13 - 3 −/−) mice show decreased synaptic release probability at parallel fiber to Purkinje cell, granule cell to Golgi cell, and granule cell to basket cell synapses and exhibit a motor learning deficit at highest rotarod speeds. Since we detected Munc 13 - 3 immuno-reactivity in the dentate gyrus, as reported here for the first time, and current studies indicated a crucial role for the cere-bellum in hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, we sys-tematically investigated Munc 13 - 3 −/ − mice versus wild-type littermates of both genders with respect to hippocampus-related cognition and a range of basic behaviors, including tests for anxiety, sensory functions, motor performance and <b>balance,</b> sensorimotor <b>gating,</b> social interaction and competence, and repetitive and compulsive behaviors. Neither basic behavior nor hippocampus-dependent cognitive performance, evaluated byMorris watermaze, hole board working and referencemem-ory, IntelliCage-based place learning including multiple rever-sals, and fear conditioning, showed any difference between genotypes.
