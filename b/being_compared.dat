5|$|The {{character}} of Marita Covarrubias was portrayed by Laurie Holden {{in all her}} appearances. She was introduced {{as a replacement for}} Steven Williams' character X, after the latter was killed by a Syndicate assassin. The character has received mixed criticism, <b>being</b> <b>compared</b> unfavorably to similar characters from the series.|$|E

5|$|Sitti Nurbaya is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} most important works of Indonesian literature, with its love story <b>being</b> <b>compared</b> to William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and the Chinese legend of the Butterfly Lovers. Some Western critics, including Dutch critic A. Teeuw and writer A. H. Johns, consider it to be the first true Indonesian novel, as opposed to Azab dan Sengsara, which was less developed in its theme of forced marriage and the negative aspects of adat.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} wide critical acclaim, <b>being</b> <b>compared</b> {{favorably to}} Civilization II. Critics praised its science fiction storyline (comparing the plot to works by Stanley Kubrick, Frank Herbert, Arthur C. Clarke, and Isaac Asimov), the in-game writing, the voice acting, the user-created custom units, {{and the depth}} of the technology tree. Alpha Centauri also won several awards for best game of the year and best strategy game of the year.|$|E

5|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics, <b>being</b> <b>compared</b> to Cyndi Lauper and Madonna {{songs from the}} 1980s. The media have drawn parallels between the song's lyrical content and the romantic relationship that Stefani had with Tony Kanal, a fellow group member of No Doubt. The song was moderately successful on the charts, reaching the top 10 in Australia, the Czech Republic, and New Zealand, {{as well as the}} top 20 in Denmark, Ireland, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of publication, Vachss worked as an attorney, in New York City, specializing in child abuse cases; {{he also had a}} career as a novelist. The duality of Vachss' work as a lawyer prosecuting and {{defending}} real cases and as a crime fiction author writing about fictional criminals resulted in Vachss <b>being</b> <b>compared</b> to the Bruce Wayne/Batman character. Vachss' eighth novel, Footsteps of the Hawk, in the Burke series featuring a vigilante private investigator of child abuse cases, was released just two months before the publication of Batman: The Ultimate Evil. He had wanted to approach the topic of sex tourism in southeast Asia, but had been unable to find a way for the Burke character to go there; the Batman character offered the chance for him to write about the topic.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sequence}} alignments {{can also}} be used to identify functionally important sites, such as binding sites, active sites, or sites corresponding to other key functions, by locating conserved domains. When looking at multiple sequence alignments, it is useful to consider different aspects of the sequences when comparing sequences. These aspects include identity, similarity, and homology. Identity means that the sequences have identical residues at their respective positions. On the other hand, similarity has to do with the sequences <b>being</b> <b>compared</b> having similar residues quantitatively. For example, in terms of nucleotide sequences, pyrimidines are considered similar to each other, as are purines. Similarity ultimately leads to homology, in that the more similar sequences are, the closer they are to being homologous. This similarity in sequences can then go on to help find common ancestry.|$|E
50|$|Two musical {{objects are}} transpositionally {{equivalent}} {{if one can}} be transformed into another by transposition. It is similar to enharmonic equivalence and octave equivalence. In many musical contexts, transpositionally equivalent chords {{are thought to be}} similar. Transpositional equivalence is a feature of musical set theory. The terms transposition and transposition equivalence allow the concept to be discussed as both an operation and relation, an activity and a state of <b>being.</b> <b>Compare</b> with modulation and related key.|$|R

5|$|Night Trap {{designer}} Rob Fulop was irked {{that his}} relatively tame game was <b>being</b> <b>compared</b> to Mortal Kombat, {{which features a}} character ripping the heart out of a defeated opponent. Nintendo senior vice president Howard Lincoln testified {{in front of the}} committee, stating Night Trap would never appear on a Nintendo system because it did not pass their guidelines. Fulop later explained that Lincoln was referring to the technical guidelines; the game could not run on a Nintendo system {{due to the lack of}} a CD-ROM drive, but Lincoln made it sound as if the game was unworthy of Nintendo's moral standards. Critics noted this as a deliberate move from Nintendo to distance themselves from the scandal and make Sega look unfavorable.|$|E
5|$|Statistical ranking systems place Lasker {{high among}} the {{greatest}} players of all time. The book Warriors of the Mind places him sixth, behind Garry Kasparov, Anatoly Karpov, Fischer, Mikhail Botvinnik and Capablanca. In his 1978 book The Rating of Chessplayers, Past and Present, Arpad Elo gave retrospective ratings to players {{based on their}} performance over the best five-year span of their career. He concluded that Lasker was the joint second strongest player of those surveyed (tied with Botvinnik and behind Capablanca). The most up-to-date system, Chessmetrics, is rather sensitive {{to the length of}} the periods <b>being</b> <b>compared,</b> and ranks Lasker between fifth and second strongest of all time for peak periods ranging in length from one to twenty years.|$|E
5|$|When two proteins' {{distance}} matrices {{share the}} same or similar features in approximately the same positions, they {{can be said to}} have similar folds with similar-length loops connecting their secondary structure elements. DALI's actual alignment process requires a similarity search after the two proteins' distance matrices are built; this is normally conducted via a series of overlapping submatrices of size 6x6. Submatrix matches are then reassembled into a final alignment via a standard score-maximization algorithm— the original version of DALI used a Monte Carlo simulation to maximize a structural similarity score that {{is a function of the}} distances between putative corresponding atoms. In particular, more distant atoms within corresponding features are exponentially downweighted to reduce the effects of noise introduced by loop mobility, helix torsions, and other minor structural variations. Because DALI relies on an all-to-all distance matrix, it can account for the possibility that structurally aligned features might appear in different orders within the two sequences <b>being</b> <b>compared.</b>|$|E

30|$|Inactivity is {{more likely}} to occur if a person is handicapped. The {{probability}} of <b>being</b> unemployed <b>compared</b> to the probability of being inactive ceteris paribus increases if a women has no partner. As expected, children at age three or below are associated with a higher probability of <b>being</b> inactive <b>compared</b> to all other groups, while there is a negative relationship with high-wage full-time employment (which exhibits the most negative coefficient) 14. Also for all other age groups, children reduce the likelihood of high-pay full-time relative to the other five labor market states.|$|R
