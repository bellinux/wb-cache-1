40|$|In this paper, {{a change}} of die roll height {{according}} to the die chamfer shape and V-ring distance of a fine blanking tool was studied by experiments on a special <b>part</b> <b>with</b> various corner shapes. Three guide plate inserts with different V-ring positions and three die inserts with different die chamfers were machined, and then a fine blanking tool was manufactured for the fine blanking experiments. Nine experiments were conducted on a 650 -ton fine blanking press. Each die roll height was measured and analyzed. It would be noticed that the die roll heights on the corner shapes of the fine <b>blanked</b> <b>parts</b> increased <b>with</b> increasing V-ring distance and die chamfer angle, but it decreased with increasing corner radius and angle. The results in this study {{can be used to}} minimize the die roll height of fine <b>blanked</b> <b>parts</b> <b>with</b> corner shapes when designing the V-ring and die chamfer of a fine blanking tool...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{advent of}} {{high-strength}} and high-precision thin-walled <b>parts</b> <b>with</b> inner ribs adapts {{to the increasing}} demand of aerospace industry, astronautics industry, military industry, and so on. For a new metal forming technology, how to determine the reasonable blank is a key problem required solved firstly in the research of power spinning process of <b>parts</b> <b>with</b> transverse inner rib. In this paper, based on the platform ABAQUS/Explicit, a reasonable 3 D FE model for power spinning of <b>parts</b> <b>with</b> transverse inner rib has been established, the power spinning process of <b>parts</b> <b>with</b> transverse inner rib has been simulated under conditions of four typical blanks and the reasonable blanks for different forming processes have been obtained. The results show the following:(1) <b>Blank</b> <b>with</b> equal half-cone angle is the best selection to deform workpiece with proper height rib; (2) while for the workpiece with excessive height rib which exceed the forming limit, <b>blank</b> <b>with</b> rib is the exclusive selection, although {{it is difficult to}} be prepared comparing <b>with</b> non-rib <b>blank...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{punching}} process, further enhance the blanking section quality. This paper studied the common blanking of 60 Mn and the fine <b>blanking</b> <b>with</b> negative clearance of 60 Mn blanking work piece metallographic structure by using scanning electron microscope. The {{results show that the}} fine <b>blanking</b> <b>with</b> negative clearance process can increase the work-hardening degree and further thin the punching surface tissue, inhibit the crack, and make the blanking surface smooth. The tensile and tear result in the generation of cracks and burrs, and the extrusion forming of fine <b>blanking</b> <b>with</b> negative clearance inhibit the generation of cracks, and eliminate the conditions of the burrs. As the extrusion process, the degree of work hardening in fine <b>blanking</b> <b>with</b> negative clearance is higher than the common blanking, the organizations are more closed. The mechanism of fine <b>blanking</b> <b>with</b> negative clearance The fine-blanking with negative clearance can be summarized as follows: Punch drop and contact sheets. The sheets produced elastic compression, tension and bending. As the punch dropping, the pattern edge pressed into the sheet metal. As the punch continues to drop, the material stress reaches the material yield limit, and the material enters the plastic state. The material flow around the hole, and began to squeeze into the die hole, resulting in plastic flow, and the bright surface of the shea...|$|R
