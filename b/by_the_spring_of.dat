5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> 1851, {{women in}} several states were wearing the dress in public. In March, Amelia Bloomer, editor of the temperance {{newspaper}} The Lily, announced that she was wearing it and printed a description of her dress along with {{instructions on how to}} make it. Soon, newspapers had dubbed it the “Bloomer dress”, and the name stuck.|$|E
5|$|Once a {{candidate}} {{was selected as}} an officer, promotion could be rapid. A. S. Smeltzer was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in 1915, after serving in the Regular Army for 15 years. He rose in rank, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spring</b> <b>of</b> 1917 had been promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and was commanding officer of the 6th Battalion, The Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment).|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> 1917, the War was {{dragging}} on towards its fourth year, and Zita's brother Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma, a serving {{officer in the}} Belgian Army, was a main mover behind a plan for Austria-Hungary to make a separate peace with France. Charles initiated contact with Sixtus through contacts in neutral Switzerland, and Zita wrote a letter inviting him to Vienna. Zita's mother Maria Antonia delivered the letter in person.|$|E

Due {{to the high}} aquifer in the region, and the steady, hot climate of the Judean desert, a {{tropical}} savanna-related flora (not rainforest, as many think) of East-African origin has established in <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>springs.</b> <b>The</b> fauna {{is that of the}} Desert zone.|$|R
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> 1917, the {{unrestricted}} submarine warfare campaign—which Germany {{had launched}} {{at the beginning}} of February—had so succeeded that the entire Allied war effort was endangered. Strong reinforcements to the Allied antisubmarine forces were desperately needed to avert defeat and needed at once. In response to a request from the Royal Navy for the service of American antisubmarine warfare ships in European waters, the United States Navy began sending destroyers eastward across the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|During a {{televised}} address on 20 April, Nixon announced {{the withdrawal of}} 150,000 U.S. troops from South Vietnam during the year. This planned withdrawal implied restrictions on any offensive U.S. action in Cambodia. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> 1970, MACV still maintained 330,648 U.S. Army and 55,039 Marine Corps troops in South Vietnam, {{most of whom were}} concentrated in 81 infantry and tank battalions. Many of them, however, were preparing to leave the country or expected to leave in the near future and would not be available for immediate combat operations.|$|E
5|$|During {{its first}} four years, Lassie {{received}} very decent ratings. However, {{at the end}} of the 1958–1959 season, the ratings had fallen out of the top 30 due to the constant turnover in the cast. Once viewers began to warm to Lockhart and Reilly as Timmy's parents, the Martin family was accepted and embraced by the public. As a result, between 1960 and 1964, Lassies ratings greatly improved and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> 1964, it received its highest rating ever, ranking at #13.|$|E

50|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> early <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> 1975 North Vietnam {{realized}} {{the time was}} right to conquer South Vietnam, so they launched a series of small ground attacks to test U.S. reaction.|$|R
5|$|Five {{of these}} had been {{completed}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> 1956 and were undergoing preflight tests when the entire program was canceled on 13 April 1956 and all components in preparation scrapped. A week later, the Attack Aviation branch of the VVS was superseded by the Fighter-Bomber branch and {{the doctrine of the}} VVS was drastically modified. No longer would the VVS provide close support to the Army, but rather it would use tactical nuclear weapons as part of the nuclear battlefield.|$|E
5|$|In {{the end of}} 1277 Constantine Tikh {{finally took}} {{measures}} to confront the rebels. He gathered a small army and advanced slowly as he had to travel in a chariot because of his injury. Ivaylo attacked and defeated this force, killing many of the emperor's close associates, {{while the rest of}} the army joined the rebels. Ivaylo personally slew Constantine Tikh, claiming that the emperor did nothing to keep his honour in the battle. After his triumph, Ivaylo began to seize the country's fortified cities, which surrendered and recognized him as emperor one by one. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> 1278 only the capital Tarnovo remained under the control of Empress Maria.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, 1992, Armenian forces {{captured}} the mountain stronghold of Shusha but {{remained on the}} defensive until the next year. Fighting between Armenians and Azeris continued {{in other parts of}} the enclave, including Lachin, Khojavend, and Aghdara. However, nearly all offensives launched by Azerbaijan failed or could not hold on to captured territory. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> 1993 the Azerbaijani military, which had the upper hand in the initial stages of the war, had been largely reduced to unorganized and incoherent fighting groups. By March 1993 the fighting had shifted to west and south of Karabakh.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} in Europe was shaky {{during this time}} and Sweden was going through financial problems. Charles XI's guardians decided to negotiate an alliance with France in 1671. This would ensure that Sweden would not be isolated {{if there was a}} war, and that the national finances would improve thanks to French subsidies. France directed its aggression against the Dutch in 1672, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> 1674, Sweden was forced to take part by directing forces towards Brandenburg, under the lead of Karl Gustav Wrangel.|$|E
5|$|By late 1830, and {{certainly}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> 1831, trouble in South Wales looked likely and, probably in response, Bute broke from his normal annual plans and in May travelled south from Scotland to Cardiff Castle. With a reform bill looking likely, tensions grew {{between the different}} political factions in Glamorganshire and how the potential new parliamentary seats should be shared out, especially between Bute and his conservative allies, Crawshay and Guest. Radical demonstrations occurred in Merthyr Tydfil, {{one of the largest}} industrial communities, in May, and the crowd set light to effigies of conservative politicians. Violence broke out and arrests were made on 10 May; the prisoners were released by the angry crowd and the local authorities effectively lost any control of the town. A general insurrection ensued on 30 May.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> 1794, France was {{in turmoil}} {{following}} {{the failure of}} the harvest, which threatened the country with starvation. In order to secure food supplies, France turned to its American colonies and the United States, which assembled a large grain convoy in Hampton Roads. To ensure the security of this convoy, the French Navy dispatched most of its Atlantic Fleet to sea during May 1794, operating in a series of large squadrons, independent cruisers and one major fleet under Villaret de Joyeuse. On 5 May, two French ships operating independently, the 36-gun frigate Atalante under Captain Charles Linois and the corvette Levrette, spied a British convoy sailing south-west, three days out from Cork, and closed to investigate.|$|E

50|$|But this Kingdom {{was only}} that in name. The first few people-about 34, {{including}} children -had {{to go through}} many hardships, eating burdock offered them <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> <b>of</b> water, raising small livestock and farming. Their houses were made of adobe and everything built was gradually destroyed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rains and floods of 1611. With the death of Montemayor, his son Diego replaced him in office but died the following year. The viceroy then appointed Lieutenant General Agustin de Zavala. He was a rich Zacatecas miner and managed the city through magistrates. Successively these magistrates were Cristobal de Irurrea, Diego Rodriguez and Alonso Lucas el Bueno.|$|R
60|$|Their {{conversation}} {{was at that}} time, however, cut short <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>springing</b> up <b>of</b> a breeze, which rendered it necessary that the closest attention should {{be paid to the}} management of the vessel among the numerous shoals which rendered the navigation there somewhat difficult.|$|R
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> 1936, the {{management}} of the New York Philharmonic was confronted with a problem. Toscanini had left in search of higher fees with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Wilhelm Furtwängler had accepted the orchestra's invitation to fill the post, but he was politically unacceptable to a section of the Philharmonic's audience because he continued to live and work in Germany under the Nazi government. Following a campaign of protest in New York he felt unable to take up the appointment. For want of any available conductor of comparable fame {{the management}} of the orchestra invited five guest conductors to divide the season among them. Barbirolli was allotted the first ten weeks of the season, comprising 26 concerts. He was followed by the composer-conductors Igor Stravinsky, Georges Enescu and Carlos Chávez, each conducting for two weeks, and finally by Artur Rodziński of the Cleveland Orchestra, for eight weeks.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> 1938, the Mingo Oak {{failed to}} produce leaves, and on May of that year, West Virginia state {{forester}} D.B. Griffin announced the tree's death. The prevailing {{theory is that the}} tree died from the release of poisonous gases and sulfur fumes from a burning spoil tip in nearby Trace Gap. The tree was felled with fanfare on September 23, 1938, with transections being sent to the Smithsonian Institution and the West Virginia State Museum. Under the terms of the Island Creek Coal Company's lease with the West Virginia Game, Fish, and Forestry Commission, the land's lease around the former tree reverted to the company following the tree's felling.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> 1971, Thorpe's {{political}} career had stalled. He {{had led the}} party to a disastrous performance in the United Kingdom general election of June 1970; in an unexpected victory for the Conservatives under Edward Heath, the Liberals lost seven of their thirteen parliamentary seats, and Thorpe's majority in North Devon fell to below 400. Bessell, with mounting business worries, did not stand for re-election in Bodmin. Thorpe faced censure for his conduct of a campaign during which he had spent extravagantly and left the party {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy; but the matter was put aside in a wave of sympathy when his wife Caroline was killed in a road accident 10 days after the election. Thorpe was devastated; he continued as leader, but for the next year performed little beyond routine party duties.|$|E

5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> 1982 {{tensions}} {{had risen}} {{again and the}} attempted assassination of the Israeli ambassador to London Shlomo Argov on June 3, 1982, prompted Israel to launch Operation Peace for Galilee. 69 Squadron flew 27 sorties in the preparation phase for the operation, from June 4 to the actual beginning of the invasion on June 6. The first of these were carried out {{on the afternoon of}} June 4, when a 4-ship formation struck the stadium in Beirut, used as a PLO weapons depot. Once Israeli ground forces began pushing into Lebanon, 69 Squadron provided close air support. One aircraft was damaged by enemy flak {{on the first day of}} the invasion, and two suffered landing accidents, but with poor weather and a shortage of targets, there was initially little fighting to be done. This changed on June 8 when it became apparent the Syrian forces in Lebanon would have to be engaged, and that same afternoon two squadron Phantoms bombed a Syrian electronic warfare facility on Jabel Barouk.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> 49 BC, the {{hardened}} {{legions of}} Caesar crossed the river Rubicon, the legal boundary of Roman Italy beyond which no commander might bring his army, and swept down the Italian peninsula towards Rome, while Pompey ordered {{the abandonment of}} Rome. Afterwards Caesar {{turned his attention to}} the Pompeian stronghold of Hispania (modern Spain) but decided to tackle Pompey himself in Greece. Pompey initially defeated Caesar, but failed to follow up on the victory, and was decisively defeated at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC, despite outnumbering Caesar's forces two to one, albeit with inferior quality troops. Pompey fled again, this time to Egypt, where he was murdered.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{withdrawal}} of U.S. forces under the policy of Vietnamization, from 1 November 1968 until 23 February 1973, Barrel Roll competed for a share of diminishing U.S tactical air assets. In December 1968, approximately 700 American strike aircraft had been available in-theater. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> 1972, that number had fallen to 313. On 18 July, the Nakhon Phanom-based 22nd Special Operations Squadron was disbanded. Its sister squadron, the 602nd Special Operations Squadron, closed out on 20 December, leaving only the 1st Special Operations Squadron at Nakhon Phanom to support Royal Laotian ground operations. The RLAF attempted {{to make up for}} the diminishing number of American sorties. During 1968 the Laotians flew 10,000 strike sorties. During 1970 through 1972 that number increased to over 30,000 in each year.|$|E
