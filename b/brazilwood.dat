25|$|Immediately {{following}} the discovery of Brazil in 1500, the Portuguese imported <b>brazilwood,</b> Indian slaves and exotic birds from there. <b>Brazilwood</b> was a much appreciated product in Europe, because {{it could be used}} to produce a red dye. During John III's rule, after the initial colonization, Portuguese explorers intensified the search for <b>brazilwood</b> and began the cultivation of sugarcane, which was well suited to the climate of Brazil, especially around Recife and Bahía.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Brazilwood</b> tree (Caesalpinia echinata) {{has been}} the {{national}} tree of Brazil since 1978.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 300 years of Brazilian colonial history, the {{economic}} {{exploitation of the}} territory was based first on <b>brazilwood</b> (pau brazil) extraction (16th century), which gave the territory its name; sugar production (16th–18th centuries); and finally on gold and diamond mining (18th century). Slaves, especially those brought from Africa, provided {{most of the work}} force of the Brazilian export economy after a brief period of Indian slavery to cut <b>brazilwood.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{the voyage}} of Álvares Cabral, the Portuguese {{concentrated}} {{their efforts on}} the lucrative possessions in Africa and India and showed little interest in Brazil. Between 1500 and 1530, relatively few Portuguese expeditions came to the new land to chart the coast and to obtain <b>brazilwood.</b> In Europe, this wood was used to produce a valuable dye to give color to luxury textiles. To extract <b>brazilwood</b> from the tropical rainforest, the Portuguese and other Europeans relied {{on the work of}} the natives, who initially worked in exchange for European goods like mirrors, scissors, knives and axes.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, bows {{are made}} from pernambuco or <b>brazilwood.</b> Both {{come from the same}} species of tree (Caesalpinia echinata), but pernambuco, used for higher-quality bows, is the {{heartwood}} of the tree and is darker in color than <b>brazilwood</b> (which is sometimes stained to compensate). Pernambuco is a heavy, resinous wood with great elasticity, which makes it an ideal wood for instrument bows. Horsehair is stretched out between the two ends of the bow. The taut horsehair is drawn over the strings to produce the cello's characteristic tone. A small knob is twisted to increase or decrease the tension of the horsehair. The tension on the bow is released when the instrument is not being used. The amount of tension a cellist puts on the bow hair depends on the preferences of the player, the style of music being played, and for students, the preferences of their teacher.|$|E
25|$|Regulations {{governing}} {{the use of}} expensive Tyrian purple dyestuffs varied over the years, but cloth dyed in these colours was generally restricted to specific classes and was used in diplomatic gifts. Other dyes used in Byzantine silk workshops were madder, kermes, indigo, weld, and <b>brazilwood.</b> Gold thread was made with silver-gilt strips wrapped around a silk core.|$|E
25|$|The Pau-brasil tree (also {{known as}} <b>Brazilwood)</b> {{was a common}} plant found along the Atlantic coast of Brazil. But {{excessive}} logging of the prized timber and red dye from the bark pushed the Pau-brasil towards extinction. However, {{since the inception of}} synthetic dyes, the Pau-Brazil has been harvested less. The Pau-brasil tree is sometimes mentioned as the origin of the country's name.|$|E
25|$|In 1494, the two kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula {{divided the}} New World between them (in the Treaty of Tordesillas), and in 1500 {{navigator}} Pedro Álvares Cabral landed {{in what is}} now Brazil and laid claim to it in the name of King Manuel I of Portugal. The Portuguese identified <b>brazilwood</b> as a valuable red dye and an exploitable product, and attempted to force indigenous groups in Brazil to cut the trees.|$|E
25|$|It is {{produced}} when {{any of a}} large number of resins (e.g., galbanum, asafoetida, etc.) are melted with potassium hydroxide, or by the distillation of <b>Brazilwood</b> extract. It may be prepared synthetically by melting 3-iodophenol, phenol-3-sulfonic acid, or benzene-1,3-disulfonic acid with potassium carbonate; by the action of nitrous acid on 3-aminophenol or on 1,3-diaminobenzene. Many ortho- and para-compounds of the aromatic series (for example, the bromophenols, benzene-para-disulfonic acid) also yield resorcinol on fusion with potassium hydroxide.|$|E
25|$|Over time, the Portuguese {{realized}} that some European countries, especially France, were also sending excursions {{to the land}} to extract <b>brazilwood.</b> Worried about foreign incursions and hoping to find mineral riches, the Portuguese crown decided to send large missions to take possession {{of the land and}} combat the French. In 1530, an expedition led by Martim Afonso de Sousa arrived in Brazil to patrol the entire coast, ban the French, and create the first colonial villages like São Vicente on the coast.|$|E
25|$|Raphael painted {{several of}} his works on wood support (Madonna of the Pinks) but he also used canvas (Sistine Madonna) and {{he was known to}} employ drying oils such as linseed or walnut oils. His palette was rich and he used almost all of the then {{available}} pigments such as ultramarine, lead-tin-yellow, carmine, vermilion, madder lake, verdigris and ochres. In {{several of his}} paintings (Ansidei Madonna) he even employed the rare <b>brazilwood</b> lake, metallic powdered gold and even less known metallic powdered bismuth.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} French corsairs arrived {{during the middle}} of the {{occupation}} and Lancaster being an exceptional diplomat as well of military mind gave them <b>Brazilwood</b> in order to keep them satisfied; as a result they left without any bloodshed and even chartered one of the French ships to sail to England, a number of them also stayed to fight with the English. With this extra number Lancaster ordered an attack Olinda in order to deter any aggression while they consolidated their gains. This was achieved at night and Olinda was sacked after meeting little resistance with more booty taken, the majority being sugar.|$|E
25|$|In {{a recent}} {{interpretation}} of the Dieppe maps, Professor Gayle K. Brunelle of California State University argued that the Dieppe school of cartographers {{should be seen as}} acting as propagandists for French geographic knowledge and territorial claims. The decades from about 1535 to 1562 when the Dieppe school of cartographers flourished were also the period in which French trade with the New World was at its 16th-century height, in terms of the North Atlantic fish trade, the fur trade, and, most important for the cartographers, the rivalry with the Portuguese for control of the coasts of Brazil and the supplies of lucrative <b>brazilwood.</b> The bright red dye produced from <b>brazilwood</b> replaced woad as the primary dyestuff in the cloth industry in France and the Low Countries. The Dieppe cartographers used the skills and geographic knowledge of Portuguese mariners, pilots and geographers working in France to produce maps meant to emphasize French interests in and dominion over territory in the New World that the Portuguese also claimed, both in Newfoundland and in Brazil. Brunelle noted that, in design and decorative style the Dieppe maps represented a blending of the latest knowledge circulating in Europe with older visions of world geography deriving from Ptolemy and mediaeval cartographers and explorers such as Marco Polo. Renaissance mapmakers such as those based in Dieppe relied heavily on each other's work, as well as on maps from previous generations, and thus their maps represented a mixture of old and new information often coexisting uneasily in the same map.|$|E
25|$|Cabot went to Bristol {{to arrange}} {{preparations}} for his voyage. Bristol was the second-largest seaport in England. From 1480 onward it had supplied several expeditions {{to look for}} Hy-Brazil. According to Celtic legend, this island lay somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. There was widespread belief among merchants in the port that Bristol men had discovered the island at earlier date but then lost track of it. Note: Ruddock had contended in a private 1988 letter to a colleague, Quinn, that she had found evidence in Italian archives that Bristol men had discovered North America pre-1470. As the island {{was believed to be}} a source of <b>brazilwood</b> (from which a valuable red dye could be obtained), merchants had economic incentive to find it.|$|E
25|$|The {{squadron}} of Vasco da Gama left Portugal in 1497, rounded the Cape and continued {{along the coast}} of East Africa, where a local pilot was brought on board who guided them across the Indian Ocean, reaching Calicut in western India in May 1498. The second voyage to India was dispatched in 1500 under Pedro Álvares Cabral. While following the same south-westerly route as Gama across the Atlantic Ocean, Cabral made landfall on the Brazilian coast. This was probably an accidental discovery, but it has been speculated that the Portuguese secretly knew of Brazil's existence and that it lay on their side of the Tordesillas line. Cabral recommended to the Portuguese King that the land be settled, and two follow up voyages were sent in 1501 and 1503. The land was found to be abundant in pau-brasil, or <b>brazilwood,</b> from which it later inherited its name, but the failure to find gold or silver meant that for the time being Portuguese efforts were concentrated on India.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{cochineal}} {{was used}} for colouring fabrics. During the colonial period, {{with the introduction of}} sheep to Latin America, the use of cochineal increased, as it provided the most intense colour and it set more firmly on woolen garments than on clothes made of materials of pre-Hispanic origin such as cotton or agave and yucca fibers. In general, cochineal is more successful on protein-based animal fibres (including silk) than plant-based material. Once the European market discovered the qualities of this product, the demand for it increased dramatically. By the beginning of the 17th century, it was traded internationally. Carmine became strong competition for other colourants such as madder root, kermes, Polish cochineal, Armenian cochineal, <b>brazilwood,</b> and Tyrian purple, as they were used for dyeing the clothes of kings, nobles, and the clergy. For the past several centuries, it was the most important insect dye used in the production of hand-woven oriental rugs, almost completely displacing lac. It was also used for painting, handicrafts, and tapestries. Cochineal-coloured wool and cotton are important materials for Mexican folk art and crafts.|$|E
25|$|In {{the main}} chapel, {{there is a}} figure of the patron saint by the painter José Troni, with {{pictures}} of the Royal family in the foreground (including Maria I, John VI and Carlota Joaquina) completed by the English painter Thomas F. Hickey. On {{the ceiling of the}} chapel, in an ovular mould, there is a painting of the Virgin attributed to Pedro Alexandrino de Carvalho (1730–810). Along the lateral walls are pulpits delimited by balusters, while on the left side the organ. The lateral altars, {{with the exception of the}} second epistle, are marked by the acronym of Pedro Alexandrino. On the roof, in the middle of a complex Baroque scene is a painting by Pedro Alexandrino representing the Assumption of Mary, encircled by a crown of cherubs and four doctors of the church: Saint Augustine, Saint Ambrose, Saint Gregory Magno and Saint Jerome, while the painter also complete a painting of the Transfiguration on the roof of the chapel. The sacristy, with access on the left-side of the main altar, is covered in polychromatic azulejos, with a credence table made from <b>Brazilwood.</b>|$|E
25|$|The species used {{to produce}} dyes include the following: Logwood Haematoxylon campechianum; a large spiny tree that can grow up to 15m tall. Its cork is thin and soft and its wood is hard. The {{heartwood}} is {{used to produce}} dyes that are red and purple. The histological stain called haematoxylin is produced from this species. <b>Brazilwood</b> tree (Caesalpinia echinata) {{is similar to the}} previous tree but smaller and with red or purple flowers. The wood is also used to produce a red or purple dye. The Madras thorn (Pithecallobium dulce) is another spiny tree native to Latin America, it grows up to 4m high and has yellow or green flowers that grow in florets. Its fruit is reddish and is used to produce a yellow dye. Indigo dye is extracted from the True indigo plant Indigofera tinctoria that is native to Asia. In Central and South America dyes are produced from two species related to this species, indigo from Indigofera suffruticosa and Natal indigo from Indigofera arrecta.yellow dye is extracted from Butea monosperma commonly called as flame of the forest.|$|E
25|$|As the Portuguese {{merchant}} fleets {{established the}} {{ports of call}} of the Eastern trade route and made commercial agreements with their rulers, Lisbon gained access to the sources of products it exclusively sold to the rest of Europe for many years: in addition to African products including pepper, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, herbs, and cotton fabrics, as well as diamonds from Malabar in India transported on the Carreira da Índia ("India Run"), it sold Moluccan spices, Ming porcelain and silk from China, slaves from Mozambique, <b>brazilwood</b> and Brazilian sugar. Lisbon also traded in fish (mainly salted cod from the Grand Banks), dried fruit, and wine. Other Portuguese cities, like Porto and Lagos, contributed to foreign trade only marginally, the country's commerce being practically limited to the exports and imports of Lisbon. The city still controlled much of the commerce of Antwerp through its depot there, which exported fine fabrics to the rest of Europe. The German and Italian merchants, seeing their trade routes, by land {{in the case of the}} first, and by the Mediterranean sea in the second, mostly abandoned, founded large trading houses in Lisbon for re-exporting goods to Europe and the Middle East.|$|E
500|$|In medieval Europe, purple, violet, murrey {{and similar}} colors were {{produced}} by dyeing wool with woad or indigo in the fleece and then piece-dyeing the woven cloth with red dyes, either the common madder or the luxury dyes kermes and cochineal. [...] Madder could also produce purples when used with alum. [...] <b>Brazilwood</b> also gave purple shades with vitriol (sulfuric acid) or potash.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is likely}} that the word [...] "Brazil" [...] comes from the Portuguese word for <b>brazilwood,</b> a tree that once grew plentifully along the Brazilian coast. In Portuguese, <b>brazilwood</b> is called pau-brasil, with the word brasil {{commonly}} given the etymology [...] "red like an ember", formed from Latin brasa ("ember") and the suffix -il (from -iculum or -ilium). As <b>brazilwood</b> produces a deep red dye, it was highly valued by the European cloth industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from Brazil. Throughout the 16th century, massive amounts of <b>brazilwood</b> were harvested by indigenous peoples (mostly Tupi) along the Brazilian coast, who sold the timber to European traders (mostly Portuguese, but also French) in return for assorted European consumer goods.|$|E
2500|$|From 1502 to 1512, the Portuguese {{claim on}} Brazil was leased by the crown to a Lisbon {{merchant}} consortium led by Fernão de Loronha for commercial exploitation. Loronha {{set up an}} extensive enterprise along the coast focusing on the harvesting of <b>brazilwood.</b> A dyewood that produces a deep red dye, reminiscent {{of the color of}} glowing embers, <b>brazilwood</b> was much in demand by the European cloth industry and previously had to be imported from India at great expense. Loronha is estimated to have harvested some 20,000 quintals of <b>brazilwood</b> on the Brazilian coast by 1506. [...] By the 1510s, French interlopers from the Atlantic clothmaking ports of Normandy and Brittany began to also routinely visit the Brazilian coast to do their own (illegal) <b>brazilwood</b> harvesting.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] name Brazil is a {{shortened}} form of Terra do Brasil, land of Brazil, {{a reference}} to <b>brazilwood,</b> given in the early 16th century to the territories leased to the [...] merchant consortium led by Fernão de Loronha for commercial exploitation of <b>brazilwood</b> {{for the production of}} wood dyes for the European textile industry.|$|E
2500|$|The Lisbon {{merchant}} Fernão de Loronha held {{not only}} Fernando de Noronha island as a hereditary captaincy but also (from 1503 to around 1512) a commercial monopoly on trade in Brazil. Between 1503 and 1512, Noronha's agents {{set up a}} string of warehouses (feitorias) along the Brazilian coast, and engaged in trade with the indigenous peoples in Brazil for <b>brazilwood,</b> a native red dye wood highly valued by European clothmakers. [...] Fernando de Noronha island was the central collection point of this network. [...] <b>Brazilwood,</b> continuously harvested by the coastal Indians and delivered to the various coastal warehouses, was shipped to the central warehouse on Fernando de Noronha island, which was intermittently visited by a larger transport ship that would carry the collected loads back to Europe. After the expiration of Loronha's commercial charter in 1512, {{the organization of the}} <b>brazilwood</b> enterprise was taken over by the Portuguese crown, but Loronha and his descendents retained private ownership of Fernando de Noronha island itself as a hereditary captaincy, at least down to the 1560s.|$|E
2500|$|The {{term for}} the <b>brazilwood</b> tree in Portuguese, pau-brasil, is derived from brasa (ember), a {{reference}} to the colour, formed from medieval Latin [...] , from Old French brese, [...] "ember, glowing charcoal", in turn from a West Germanic *brasa).|$|E
2500|$|The hair {{of the bow}} {{traditionally}} {{comes from}} {{the tail of a}} grey male horse (which has predominantly white hair), though some cheaper bows use synthetic fiber. Occasional rubbing with rosin makes the hair grip the strings intermittently, causing them to vibrate. Originally the stick was made out of snakewood, but modern day bows are now traditionally made of <b>brazilwood,</b> although a stick made from a more select quality (and more expensive) <b>brazilwood</b> is called pernambuco. Both types come from the same tree species. Some student bows are made of fiberglass or various inexpensive woods. [...] Some recent bow design innovations use carbon fiber for the stick, at all levels of craftsmanship. Inexpensive bows for students are made of fiberglass.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first hint}} of the new name {{is found in the}} Cantino planisphere (1502), which draws {{extensively}} on the 1501 mapping expedition. [...] The label Rio D Brasil ("River of Brazil") is given near Porto Seguro, just below the São Francisco River, almost certainly an indicator of a river where ample <b>brazilwood</b> could be found on its shores. That label is repeated on subsequent maps (e.g. Canerio map of 1505).|$|E
2500|$|The {{official}} Portuguese {{name of the}} land, {{in original}} Portuguese records, was the [...] "Land of the Holy Cross" [...] (Terra da Santa Cruz), but European sailors and merchants commonly called it simply the [...] "Land of Brazil" [...] (Terra do Brasil) {{on account of the}} <b>brazilwood</b> trade. The popular appellation eclipsed and eventually supplanted the official Portuguese name. Some early sailors called it the [...] "Land of Parrots".|$|E
2500|$|It {{was during}} Loronha's tenure {{that the name}} began to {{transition}} to Terra do Brasil ("Land of Brazil") and its inhabitants to Brasileiros. Although some commentators have alleged that Loronha, as a New Christian (a converted Jew), might {{have been reluctant to}} refer to it after the Christian cross, the truth is probably more mundane. It was rather common for 15th- and 16th-century Portuguese to refer to distant lands by their commercial product rather than their proper name, e.g. Madeira island and the series of coasts of West Africa (Melegueta Coast, Ivory Coast, Gold Coast, Slave Coast), etc. [...] Brazil simply followed that pattern. <b>Brazilwood</b> harvesting was doubtlessly the principal and often sole objective of European visitors to Brazil {{in the early part of}} the 16th century.|$|E
2500|$|While the <b>brazilwood</b> root of Brazil is {{generally}} accepted, {{it has been}} occasionally challenged. Among the alternative hypotheses {{is that it is}} named after the legendary island of Brasil. Many 14th-century nautical maps denoted a phantom island called insula brasil in the north Atlantic Ocean, usually circular in shape and located just southwest of Ireland. Although its source is uncertain, it is sometimes believed this brasil stems from Celtic word bress, which means [...] "to bless", and that the island was named Hy-Brasil, or [...] "Island of the Blessed". Such an island might have been spoken of in legendary old Irish immrama, then filtered into seafarer's tales, before being incorporated into maps by Italian cartographers, beginning with the 1325-30 portolan chart of Angelino Dalorto.|$|E
2500|$|The {{connection}} to the <b>brazilwood</b> harvest {{is also found in}} the demonym for the country. In the Portuguese language, an inhabitant of Brazil is referred to as a Brasileiro. But the common rules of the language reserves the suffix -eiro to denote occupations, rather than inhabitants (which are usually given the suffix -ano). The English equivalent is the suffix -er for occupations (e.g. baker, shoemaker) and the suffix -an for demonyms (e.g. Indian, American). If this rule was followed, an inhabitant of Brazil should have been known (in Portuguese) as a Brasiliano. But uniquely among Portuguese demonyms, they are instead referred to as a Brasileiro, an occupation. That too stemmed from Loronha's time, when a brasileiro was a reference to a [...] "brazilwood cutter", a job invariably undertaken by the Tupí Indians on the coast. The name of the occupation was simply extended to refer to all the inhabitants of the country.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} the 14th century, Basque whalemen may have made [...] "seasonal trips" [...] to {{southern}} Ireland and the English Channel – where they undoubtedly targeted right whales. These regions became particularly well-known {{to them by the}} 16th century. By {{the first decade of the}} 17th century, Basque whaling had reached Brazil, not on its own initiative, but on that of the colonial government. With imports of whale oil from the Basque region and Cape Verde not meeting the demands of the expanding colonial sugar industry, they saw a solution in the humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) and southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) that inhabited their coastal waters. Lacking the technical know-how to hunt them, they sought help abroad. In 1602, two Basque whalers accompanied Diogo Botelho, the newly appointed governor general of Brazil, to the colonial capital of Bahia de Todos os Santos. It was their crews that introduced commercial whaling to colonial Brazil. Each year for nearly a decade Basque ships made runs from Biscay to Brazil, where the oil they produced supplied sugar mills (engenhos) with a dependable source of fuel for nocturnal grinding, as well as oil for lubricating machinery and caulking boats and ships. This ended in 1610, when one of the Basque captains tried to smuggle <b>Brazilwood</b> out of the country. He was discovered and imprisoned – as were his men. The same year the crown declared whaling to be a royal monopoly.|$|E
2500|$|The Santa Cruz ("Holy Cross") name did not {{disappear}} altogether. In the 1527 {{map of the}} Visconte Maggiolo it re-appears in the dual label Terre Sante Crusis de lo Brasil e del Portugal ("Land of the Holy Cross of Brazil and of Portugal"). Years later, in 1552, the chronicler João de Barros grumbled at the change in name. [...] Barros notes how, before leaving in 1500, Pedro Álvares Cabral erected a huge wooden cross as the marker of the land, but that later, because <b>brazilwood</b> was brought from this land, [...] "this name (Brazil) became stuck {{in the mouth of}} the people, and the name Santa Cruz was lost, as if the name of some wood which tinctured cloths was more important than that wood which has tinctured all the Sacraments by which we were saved, by the blood of Jesus Christ, which was spilled upon it." [...] Barros goes on to moan that he can do little but remind his readers of the solemnity of the original name and urge them to use it lest, on Judgment Day, [...] "they be accused of being worshipers of brazilwood" [...] rather than worshipers of the Holy Cross. [...] "For the honor of such a great land let us call it a province, and say the 'Province of Holy Cross', which sounds better among the prudent than 'Brazil', which was placed vulgarly without consideration and is an unfit name for these properties of the royal crown." ...|$|E
50|$|Pernambuco was a {{distortion}} of Tupi para-nã (wide river) + mbuka (hollow or broken), {{referring to the}} coastal reefs; it came to mean {{the place where the}} <b>Brazilwood</b> tree (Caesalpinia echinata) was found, and by derivation its wood, now called <b>Brazilwood.</b> <b>Brazilwood</b> trees, source of a brilliant red dye, grew in abundance on the Atlantic coast of Brazil, and were the chief trading commodity of precolonial and early colonial times.|$|E
50|$|Immediately {{following}} the discovery of Brazil in 1500, the Portuguese imported <b>brazilwood,</b> Indian slaves and exotic birds from there. <b>Brazilwood</b> was a much appreciated product in Europe, because {{it could be used}} to produce a red dye.

50|$|Many {{members of}} the genus Caesalpinia produce brazilin, {{including}} <b>brazilwood</b> (C. echinata) and sappanwood (C. sappan). The sappanwood is found in India, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka, the latter being a major supplier of the wood to Europe during the early Middle Ages. Later, discovery of <b>brazilwood</b> {{in the new world}} led to its rise in popularity with the dye industry and eventually its over-exploitation. <b>Brazilwood</b> is now classified as an endangered species.|$|E
