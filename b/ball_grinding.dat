40|$|The {{size and}} {{distribution}} of particles are particle characteristics which are among other things significantly important for processing charateristics of raw materials and biopharmaceutical properties of produced drugs. Shredding means decreasing the size of particles using mechanic forces, like cutting, crushing, mincing, chopping, milling or grinding. Particle size or rather particle size distribution does influence the processing characteristics of raw materials and the biopharmaceutic characteristics of manufactured drugs. Different apparatuses are used for milling particulate materials. For the grinding of materials to obtain a very fine product of extremely small particle size, stirred ball mills are used, because they reach higher energy densities and therefore work more efficiently in comparison to other mills.

Planetary ball mills are smaller than common ball mills and mainly used in laboratories for grinding sample material down to very small sizes.

The direction of movement of the sun wheel is opposite to that of the grinding jars (ratio: 1:-2 or 1:-1 or else).The <b>grinding</b> <b>balls</b> in the <b>grinding</b> jars are subjected to superimposed rotational movements, the so-called Coriolis forces. The difference in speeds between the <b>balls</b> and <b>grinding</b> jars produces an interaction between frictional and impact forces, which releases high dynamic energies.
