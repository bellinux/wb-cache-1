25|$|George and Madeline took a kind <b>but</b> <b>firm</b> {{approach}} in rearing their children, encouraging {{hard work and}} regular schedules. In his autobiography, White relates that his parents ran a strict schedule on Sundays; they locked him in his room for silent prayer, a time so boring that he almost begged to do homework. His father forbade Walter from reading any books less than 25 years old so he chose to read Dickens, Thackeray, and Trollope {{by the time he}} was 12. When he was 8, he threw a rock at a white child who called him a derogatory name for drinking from the fountain reserved for blacks. Events such as this shaped White's self-identity. He began to develop skills to pass for white, which he used later to preserve his safety as a civil rights investigator for the NAACP in the South.|$|E

500|$|Around 1854 Isabella began a {{relationship}} with Samuel Orchart Beeton. His family had lived in Milk Street {{at the same time}} as the Maysons—Samuel's father still ran the Dolphin Tavern there—and Samuel's sisters had also attended the same Heidelberg school as Isabella. Samuel was the first British publisher of Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin in 1852 and had also released two innovative and pioneering journals: The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine in 1852 and the Boys' Own magazine in 1855. The couple entered into extensive correspondence in 1855—in which Isabella signed her letters as [...] "Fatty"—and they announced their engagement in June 1855. The marriage took place at St Martin's Church, Epsom, in July the following year, and was announced in The Times. Samuel was [...] "a discreet <b>but</b> <b>firm</b> believer in the equality of women" [...] and their relationship, both personal and professional, was an equal partnership. The couple went to Paris for a three-week honeymoon, after which Samuel's mother joined them in a visit to Heidelberg. They returned to Britain in August, when the newlyweds moved into 2Chandos Villas, a large Italianate house in Pinner.|$|E
500|$|Gibraltar's fortifications {{have evolved}} {{in a number}} of stages. Its first {{permanent}} inhabitants, the Moors of North Africa, are said to have established a fort on Djebel Tarik (the Mount of Tarik, a name that was eventually corrupted into Gibraltar) [...] "to be on guard and watch events {{on the other side of}} the Straits" [...] as early as 1068. Gibraltar was fortified for the first time in 1160 by the Almohad Sultan Abd al-Mu'min in response to the coastal threat posed by the Christian kings of Aragon and Castile. The Rock of Gibraltar was renamed Jebel al-Fath (the Mount of Victory), though this name did not persist, and a fortified town named Medinat al-Fath (the City of Victory) was laid out on the upper slopes of the Rock. It is unclear how much of Medinat al-Fath was actually built, as the surviving archaeological remains of Moorish Gibraltar are scanty. A portion of wall some [...] long still survives to the south of the main part of the city of Gibraltar, of similar design to defensive walls in Morocco. It may have protected a settlement on the upper part of the Rock, around where the modern Queen's Road is, <b>but</b> <b>firm</b> archaeological evidence is lacking.|$|E
500|$|Prayer {{and private}} offerings are {{generally}} called [...] "personal piety": acts that reflect {{a close relationship}} between an individual and a god. Evidence of personal piety is scant before the New Kingdom. Votive offerings and personal names, {{many of which are}} theophoric, suggest that commoners felt some connection between themselves and their gods. <b>But</b> <b>firm</b> evidence of devotion to deities became visible only in the New Kingdom, reaching a peak late in that era. Scholars disagree about the meaning of this change—whether direct interaction with the gods was a new development or an outgrowth of older traditions. Egyptians now expressed their devotion through a new variety of activities in and around temples. They recorded their prayers and their thanks for divine help on stelae. They gave offerings of figurines that represented the gods they were praying to, or that symbolized the result they desired; thus a relief image of Hathor and a statuette of a woman could both represent a prayer for fertility. Occasionally, a person took a particular god as a patron, dedicating his or her property or labor to the god's cult. These practices continued into the latest periods of Egyptian history. These later eras saw more religious innovations, including the practice of giving animal mummies as offerings to deities depicted in animal form, such as the cat mummies given to the feline goddess Bastet. Some of the major deities from myth and official religion were rarely invoked in popular worship, but many of the great state gods were important in popular tradition.|$|E

500|$|In the 1966 NBA Playoffs, the Sixers again met the Celtics, and for {{the first}} time had home-court advantage. However, Boston easily won the first two games on the road, winning 115–96 and 114–93; Chamberlain played within his usual range, but his {{supporting}} cast shot under 40%. This caused sports journalist Joe McGinnis to comment: [...] "The Celtics played like champions and the Sixers just played." [...] In Game 3, Chamberlain scored 31 points and 27 rebounds for an important road win, and the next day, coach Schayes planned to hold a joint team practice. However, Chamberlain said he was [...] "too tired" [...] to attend, and even refused Schayes' plea to at least show up and shoot a few foul shots with the team. In Game 4, Boston won 114–108. Prior to Game 5, Chamberlain was nowhere to be found, skipping practice and being non-accessible. Outwardly, Schayes defended his star center as [...] "excused from practice", but his teammates knew the truth and were much less forgiving. In Game 5 itself, Chamberlain was superb, scoring 46 points and grabbing 34 rebounds, but the Celtics won the game 120–112 and the series. Cherry is highly critical of Chamberlain: while conceding he was the only Sixers player who performed in the series, he pointed out his unprofessional, egotistical behavior as being a bad example for his teammates. Prior to the 1966–67 NBA season, the friendly but unassertive Schayes was replaced by a familiar face, the crafty <b>but</b> <b>firm</b> Alex Hannum. In what Cherry calls a tumultuous locker room meeting, Hannum addressed several key issues he observed during the last season, several of them putting Chamberlain in an unfavorable light. Sixers forward Chet Walker testified that on several occasions, players had to pull Chamberlain and Hannum apart to prevent a fistfight. Fellow forward Billy Cunningham observed that Hannum [...] "never backed down" [...] and [...] "showed who was the boss". By doing this, he won Chamberlain's respect. When emotions cooled off, Hannum pointed out to Chamberlain that he was on the same page in trying to win a title; but to pull this off, he – like his teammates – had to [...] "act like a man" [...] both on and off the court. Concerning basketball, he persuaded him to change his style of play. Loaded with several other players who could score, such as future Hall-of-Famers Hal Greer and newcomer Billy Cunningham, Hannum wanted Chamberlain to concentrate more on defense.|$|E
