40|$|The {{residential}} sector uses nearly 30 % of all electricity in Canada, and, {{it is important}} to know how this energy is being used, so that savings may be identified and realised. We propose a method that can be applied to hourly whole-house electrical energy data to partially disaggregate total household electricity use into five <b>load</b> categories/parameters (<b>base</b> <b>load,</b> activity <b>load,</b> <b>heating</b> season gradient, cooling season gradient and lowest external temperature at which air-conditioning is used). This paper develops the proposed method, and verifies it using high-resolution end-use data from twelve households with known characteristics. We then apply the method to hourly whole-house (smart meter) data from 327 households in Ontario. The roll-out of smart (advanced) metering infrastructure in many countries will make hourly whole-house data abundant, and we propose that this method could be widely applied by utilities to target their demand-side management programs towards households more likely to provide benefits, thus increasing the cost-effectiveness of such programs.

40|$|The {{three main}} factors that {{underpin}} the project study were: 1) Biofuels and alternative energy {{are becoming more}} important parts of the British Columbia energy matrix. 2) In central BC, the mountain pine beetle infestation has led to increased harvesting opportunities for lumber, pulp and paper and wood pellet producing companies. 3) In 2007, the University of Northern British Columbia branded itself as the Green University and introduced six green objectives {{as part of the}} process. It was from the intersection of these three facts that an investigation was undertaken to determine the feasibility of utilizing wood pellet derived heat energy for campus heating and cooling. The first part of this paper was to review and document the existing heating system at UNBC and review the options for selecting, funding, installing and operating a wood pellet biomass system in parallel with the existing natural gas campus heating system. The second part of the paper was an attempt to calculate the approximate cost of a wood pellet biomass energy system suitably sized to fulfill the <b>base</b> <b>load</b> <b>heat</b> requirements of the Prince George UNBC campus. Interviews were conducted with key university personnel, industry and regulatory bodies to ascertain costs. Costs and estimates were then calculated with Natural Resources Canada's RETScreen International Clean Energy Support software and Excel spreadsheets to determine the financial viability of such a project. The analyses showed that wood pellet heat energy is financially feasible as an alternative energy source at UNBC. The original print copy of this thesis may be available here: [URL]...|$|R

Firstly, the structure and working principle of the IGBT <b>based</b> <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> system are analyzed, and the design method for major parts is discussed. Secondly, a mathematical model to describe the dynamic characteristics is established, and conventional PID and Fuzzy PID control algorithms for the controlled plant are designed. Furthermore, simulations and experimental investigations focused on the developed <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> system and its control strategies are carried out. The simulation and experiment results show that {{to achieve the same}} heat flux density, the developed <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> system is five times faster than the traditional <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> system.

30|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} {{currently}} not {{represented in the}} national energy mix of Oman and only plays a very minor role in the Arabian Peninsula in general. In the whole region {{a large percentage of}} the energy consumption is used for cooling. In Oman 50 % of the residential power supply is only used for residential cooling (Sweetnam et al. 2014) in Saudi Arabia even 80 % and the average for the whole Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), consisting of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, is 40 – 50 % (Lashin et al. 2015). The electricity demand will rise in the GCC by 7 – 8 % per year on average; in the smallest and fastest-growing economies, demand will grow even faster (GCC 2010). The electricity sector in Oman is primarily based on natural gas (97.5 %) and diesel (2.5 %, Authority for Electricity Regulation, Oman). The same applies to the other GCC countries, which all fall in the top 25 countries of carbon dioxide emissions per capita (Reiche 2010). Geothermal energy could significantly contribute to a greener energy mix, especially in countries in possession of high‐temperature and intermediate temperature hydrothermal systems, like Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. The usage of thermally driven cooling could significantly help to lower the energy demand in this sector. Thermally driven cooling requires temperatures of 70 – 100  °C. The energy for sustainable cooling supply can be developed from solar and geothermal sources. Solar heat supply is fluctuating, whereas geothermal <b>heat</b> can provide <b>base</b> <b>load</b> <b>heat</b> supply. The results of this study show that the target temperatures can be reached in around 2000  m depth. Fault structures which exist in the contact zone between the Tertiary sedimentary sequence and the Semail Ophiolite, correlated with hot springs, constitute a potential setting for drilling.|$|R

40|$|A combined-cycle {{power plant}} is {{proposed}} that uses heat from a high-temperature reactor and fossil fuel to meet base-load and peak electrical demands. The high-temperature gas turbine produces shaft power to turn an electric generator. The hot exhaust is then fed to a {{heat recovery steam generator}} (HRSG) that provides steam to a steam turbine for added electrical power production. A simplified computational {{model of the}} thermal power conversion system was developed in order to parametrically investigate two different steady-state operation conditions: <b>base</b> <b>load</b> nuclear <b>heat</b> only from an Advanced High Temperature Reactor (AHTR), and combined nuclear heat with fossil heat to increase the turbine inlet temperature. These two cases bracket the expected range of power levels, where any intermediate power level can result during electrical load following. The computed results indicate that combined nuclear-fossil systems have the potential to offer both low-cost base-load electricity and lower-cost peak power relative to the existing combination of base-load nuclear plants and separate fossil-fired peak-electricity production units. In addition, electric grid stability, reduced greenhouse gases, and operational flexibility can also result with using the conventional technology presented here for the thermal power conversion system coupled with the AHTR...|$|R

The use of wood-chips at cogeneration (CHP) plants brings up {{a range of issues}} that have to be solved simultaneously, not only when owners select the installed electrical and heat capacity, but also during plant operation, in order to secure maximum energy efficiency and loading. Two radically contradictory solutions are possible when choosing the installed capacity of CHP plants: compliance with the <b>base</b> <b>load</b> of the <b>heating</b> system, ensuring operation of the CHP plant for 4000 – 8000 hours/ year and compliance with the optimum <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> of the <b>heating</b> system during the whole year, providing heat to consumers until the moment when heat consumption starts decreasing.

40|$|A multi-temperature 4 drawer {{catering}} cabinet {{was designed}} to operate using a low-pressure receiver with capillary expansion to the separate evaporator in each drawer. Low-pressure receivers {{have been shown to}} be an effective way of allowing evaporators to operate in a fully flooded mode thus enabling more efficient use of the evaporator surface for heat transfer. If a low-pressure receiver is used in a refrigeration circuit the control of refrigerant flow into the evaporator is less critical as the expansion device is not responsible for preventing liquid returning to the compressor. Therefore, a capillary expansion device can be used effectively over a range of operating pressures. The system was shown to be effective at maintaining temperatures in the storage drawers during chilled, frozen and mixed storage temperature tests carried out to the EN 441 test standard. The cabinet operated successfully at all conditions except when the <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> in each drawer was excessive (> 400 W above <b>base</b> level <b>heat</b> <b>load).</b> In this case, refrigerant was found to back up in the condenser and the low-pressure receiver was empty of liquid refrigerant.

40|$|Current {{knowledge}} {{of the potential for}} an increased use of industrial district heating (DH) due to conversions of industrial processes to DH is limited. In this paper, a Method for <b>Heat</b> <b>Load</b> Analysis (MeHLA) for exploring industrial DH conversions has been developed. This method can be a helpful tool for analyzing the impact different industrial processes have on the local DH system, when processes that utilize electricity and other fuels, convert to utilizing DH. <b>Heat</b> <b>loads</b> for different types of industries and processes are analyzed according to characteristics such as temperature levels and time-dependency. MeHLA has been used to analyze 34 Swedish industries and the method demonstrates how conversion of industrial processes to DH can result in <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> duration curves that are less outdoor temperature-dependent and more evenly distributed over the year. An evenly distributed <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> curve can result in increased annual operating time for <b>base</b> <b>load</b> DH plants such as cogeneration plants, leading to increased electricity generation. In addition to the positive effects for the DH load duration curve, the conversions to DH can also lead to an 11 % reduction in the use of electricity, a 40 % reduction in the use of fossil fuels and a total energy end-use saving of 6 % in the studied industries. Converting the industrial processes to DH will also lead to a potential reduction of the global carbon dioxide emissions by 112, 000 tonnes per year.
