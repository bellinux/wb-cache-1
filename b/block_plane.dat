25|$|Bench {{planes are}} {{characterized}} by the cutting iron bedded with the bevel facing down and attached to a chipbreaker. Most metal bench planes, and some larger wooden ones, are designed with a rear handle known as a tote. Block planes {{are characterized by}} the absence of a chipbreaker and the cutting iron bedded with the bevel up. The <b>block</b> <b>plane</b> is usually a smaller tool that can be held with one hand and is used for general purpose work such as taking down a knot in the wood, smoothing small pieces, chamfering edges, and making the end of a sawed board square and smooth.|$|E
50|$|A <b>block</b> <b>plane</b> {{has many}} other uses in woodworking. Typically, {{it is used}} for {{cleaning}} up components by removing thin shavings of wood {{in order to make}} a component fit within fine tolerances.

30|$|Pectoral nerve (PECS) <b>block</b> and serratus <b>plane</b> <b>block</b> are {{performed}} {{to suppress the}} pain in the anterior thoracic wall. Blanco et al. suggested that PECS I and II <b>blocks</b> and serratus <b>plane</b> <b>block</b> can be performed with ultrasound guidance [1 – 3]. The local anesthetic is injected between the pectoralis major and minor muscles for PECS I block, between the pectoralis minor and serratus anterior muscles for PECS II block, and between the latissimus dorsi and serratus anterior muscles for serratus <b>plane</b> <b>block.</b> Although the local anesthetic is injected on serratus anterior muscles in both PECS II <b>block</b> and serratus <b>plane</b> <b>block,</b> the local anesthetic is injected to more dorsal side in serratus <b>plane</b> <b>block</b> than in PECS II <b>block.</b> Therefore, serratus <b>plane</b> <b>block</b> can anesthetize more number of intercostal nerves. These blocks might be effective as alternative analgesia for the anterior thoracic wall without causing the potential serious complications reported after PVB.|$|R

50|$|A <b>block</b> <b>plane</b> is {{frequently}} used for paring end grain. This is possible because a <b>block</b> <b>plane</b> has its blade {{set at a}} shallow bed angle, allowing the blade to slice through end grain more efficiently; furthermore, for this to work, the plane {{is frequently}} held at an angle sometimes as much as 45 degrees to the direction of travel, so that the cutting edge slices the wood fibers as they pass {{from one end of}} the cutting edge to the other.|$|E

5000|$|According to Patrick's Stanley Blood and Gore, Stanley {{marketing}} materials describe {{the origin of}} the name of this tool as follows: [...] "A <b>Block</b> <b>Plane</b> was first made to meet the demand for a Plane which could be easily held in one hand while planing across the grain, particularly the ends of boards, etc. This latter work many Carpenters call 'Blocking in', hence the name 'Block' Plane." [...] Tradition also claims that the <b>block</b> <b>plane</b> gets its name from its traditional use to level and remove cleaver marks from butchers' blocks that were built with the end grain facing up.|$|E
2500|$|Planing the {{end grain}} of the board {{involves}} different techniques, and frequently different planes designed for working end grain. <b>Block</b> <b>planes</b> and other bevel-up planes are often effective in planing the difficult nature of end grain.

To assess the efficacy {{and safety of}} serratus intercostals <b>plane</b> <b>block</b> in comparison with local wound infiltration in women under-going breast surgery. Methods: This prospective study was conducted on 46 female patients undergoing breast surgeries. Patients {{were divided into two}} groups: serratus block (SB) group (n =  23) : patients received induction with serratus intercostal <b>plane</b> <b>block</b> with 0. 4  ml/kg bupivacaine 0. 25 % plus fentanyl 20  μg, infiltration group (n =  23) received induction with the borders of the surgical wound were infiltrated with 0. 4  ml/kg of bupivacaine 0. 25 % and 20  μg fentanyl at the end of surgery. VAS pain scores, postoperative patient satisfaction score, time to the first analgesic requirement, total dose of rescue analgesic and the incidence of postoperative complications as vomiting were all recorded. Results: Intraoperative pain scores and postoperative patient satisfaction scores were significantly lower in group SB compared with infiltration group. Total dose of rescue analgesic was significantly lower in SB group compared with Infiltration group. Significant difference between the study groups regarding the incidence of vomiting. Time to the first analgesic dose was significantly longer in group SB compared to Infiltration group.

We postulated that the advantage of performing transversus abdominis <b>plane</b> <b>block</b> after caesarean section might be even more obvious after general anaesthesia, resulting in reduced 24 -h consumption of morphine. DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: In this single centre, randomised double-blind controlled trial, 40 women who underwent caesarean delivery under general anaesthesia were allocated randomly to receive a transversus abdominis <b>plane</b> <b>block</b> or no block. In those who received the block, 20  ml of levobupivacaine 2. 5  mg ml was deposited bilaterally into the transversus abdominis plane under ultrasound guidance using a Sonosite Titan (SonoSite, Bothell, Washington, USA) 7 - 13  MHz linear transducer {{at the end of}} surgery when the patient was still anaesthetised. We recorded patient-controlled intravenous morphine use for 24  h, pain scores at rest and activity, sedation, nausea and vomiting, use of antiemetic medication and overall maternal satisfaction. The primary outcome was 24 -h morphine consumption. Patients who received the transversus abdominis <b>plane</b> <b>block</b> used significantly less morphine in 24  h than those in the control group [12. 3 (2. 6) vs. 31. 4  mg (3. 1), P <  0. 001) and had higher satisfaction scores [16 (80 %) vs. 5 (25 %), P =  0. 012).
