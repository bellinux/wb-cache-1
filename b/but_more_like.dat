5|$|Aykroyd {{had never}} written a {{screenplay}} before, as he admitted in the 1998 documentary, Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers, or even read one, {{and he was}} unable to find a writing partner. Consequently, he put together a very descriptive volume that explained the characters' origins and how the band members were recruited. His final draft was 324 pages, which was three times longer than a standard screenplay, written not in a standard screenplay format, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> free verse. To soften the impact, Aykroyd made a joke of the thick script and had it bound with the cover of the Los Angeles Yellow Pages directory for when he turned it in to producer Robert K. Weiss. Landis was given the task of editing the script into a usable screenplay, which took him about two weeks.|$|E

25|$|Eventually {{the modern}} theory of quantum {{mechanics}} came to picture light as (in some sense) both a particle and a wave, and (in another sense), as a phenomenon which is neither a particle nor a wave (which actually are macroscopic phenomena, such as baseballs or ocean waves). Instead, modern physics sees light as {{something that can be}} described sometimes with mathematics appropriate to one type of macroscopic metaphor (particles), and sometimes another macroscopic metaphor (water waves), but is actually something that cannot be fully imagined. As in the case for radio waves and the X-rays involved in Compton scattering, physicists have noted that electromagnetic radiation tends to behave more like a classical wave at lower frequencies, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a classical particle at higher frequencies, but never completely loses all qualities of one or the other. Visible light, which occupies a middle ground in frequency, can easily be shown in experiments to be describable using either a wave or particle model, or sometimes both.|$|E
500|$|In January 2006, Underoath {{entered the}} studio to record their fifth album, Define the Great Line; the title is {{presented}} upon the theory of an individual having [...] "to find that line and that way to live your life." [...] The band had been writing for the album {{two weeks after the}} release of They're Only Chasing Safety. Matt Goldman, who produced albums for Copeland and Norma Jean, and Adam Dutkiewicz, guitarist for Killswitch Engage, enlisted as producers. Chamberlain noted that the vocals for the album would sound less like an imitation of former vocalist Taylor, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the vocals of Chamberlain's former band. The lyrics were also meaningful to Chamberlain because they had been written about [...] "things that have molded him into who he is today".|$|E
500|$|The quagga is {{believed}} to have been [...] long and [...] tall at the shoulder. Its coat pattern was unique among equids: zebra-like in the front <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a horse in the rear. It had brown and white stripes on the head and neck, brown upper parts and a white belly, tail and legs. The stripes were boldest on the head and neck and became gradually fainter further down the body, blending with the reddish brown of the back and flanks, until disappearing along the back. It appears to have had a high degree of polymorphism, with some individuals having almost no stripes and others having patterns similar to the extinct southern population of Burchell's zebra, where the stripes covered most of the body except for the hind parts, legs and belly. It also had a broad dark dorsal stripe on its back. It had a standing mane with brown and white stripes.|$|E

Elder of the Chicago Tribune said [...] "Spears {{delivers}} a performance {{with the same}} sincerity she invests into a Pepsi commercial, only this film contains twice the sugary calories", while New York Daily News writer Elizabeth Weitzma noted, [...] "Here's what Crossroads does not have: Cohesive direction from Tamra Davis, intelligent dialogue, a comprehensible plot". Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide commented that [...] "the film's mealy-mouthed messages about feminine empowerment will almost certainly fall on deaf ears, since even 11-year-olds know Spears's power resides largely in her taut torso". Claudia Puig of USA Today considered it [...] "less a movie than a mind-numbingly dull road trip", while The Washington Post reporter Ann Hornaday said, [...] "not a music video, not yet a movie, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> an extended-play advertisement for the Product that is Britney". Jane Dark of Village Voice compared Crossroads to Mariah Carey's Glitter, saying, [...] "you {{spend a lot of}} time wondering, 'Better or worse than Glitter?'

500|$|Giving {{the episode}} a 7.5 out of 10, Eric Walters of Paste stated, that [...] "Unlike last year, [...] "Legends of Today" [...] {{did not feel}} like a Flash episode {{featuring}} Team Arrow."

[...] He felt that [...] "Legends of Today" [...] {{was not so much}} a The Flash episode, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> [...] "the first half of something much larger". In the end, he wished [...] "the show had embraced it fully". Den of Geek's Mike Cecchini gave the episode 3.5 stars out of 5, saying: [...] "I'm really kind of amazed at just how much work [...] "Legends of Today" [...] gets done without just becoming a massive mess." [...] He described it as [...] "a proper two-parter this year" [...] and concluded: [...] "Amidst all the Legends of Tomorrow hooplah and the fun of getting the teams together, [...] "Legends of Today" [...] still manages to move the main Flash season 2 storyline forward in a couple of neat ways." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{achieve a}} tone and quality {{that was true}} to the story as well as {{reflected}} {{the period in which}} it is set, Spielberg once again collaborated with cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, saying, [...] "Early on, we both knew that we did not want this to look like a Technicolor extravaganza about World War II, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> color newsreel footage from the 1940s, which is very desaturated and low-tech." [...] Kamiński had the protective coating stripped from the camera lenses, making them closer to those used in the 1940s. He explains that [...] "without the protective coating, the light goes in and starts bouncing around, which makes it slightly more diffused and a bit softer without being out of focus." [...] The cinematographer completed the overall effect by putting the negative through bleach bypass, a process that reduces brightness and color saturation. The shutter timing was set to 90 or 45 degrees for many of the battle sequences, as opposed to the standard of 180-degree timing. Kamiński clarifies, [...] "In this way, we attained a certain staccato in the actors' movements and a certain crispness in the explosions, which makes them slightly more realistic." ...|$|E

500|$|International {{productions}} {{have opened}} to similarly ambivalent critical reception. The West End production opened to {{a slightly more}} upbeat response. The majority of critics have appreciated the spectacle of the lavish production, and the [...] "powerhouse" [...] performances of actors in {{the roles of the}} two witches. However, contemporaries have characterized the production as overblown, occasionally preachy, and suffering from more hype than heart. Although Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph described it as [...] "at times ... a bit of a mess," [...] he praised Holzman's script, described Kenneth Posner's lighting design as [...] "magical" [...] and lauded Menzel's Elphaba and Helen Dallimore's Glinda. Michael Billington of The Guardian gave it three out of five stars and remarked on the competence of all the lead actors; however, he complained that Wicked was [...] "all too typical of the modern Broadway musical: efficient, knowing and highly professional <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a piece of industrial product than something that genuinely touches the heart or mind". Paul Taylor of The Independent gave extremely negative remarks to his viewing of the London production, calling the attempt at topical political allegory [...] "well-meaning but also melodramatic, incoherent and dreadfully superficial" [...] while deploring the acting, songs and book, concluding that [...] "the production manages to feel at once overblown and empty." ...|$|E
500|$|For Japan, the {{war began}} with the {{undeclared}} war and invasion of China in 1937, which the Japanese authorities called [...] "The China Incident". The government dispatched a [...] "pen brigade" [...] to write and film the action in China with [...] "humanist values". Tomotaka Tasaka's Mud and Soldiers (1939) for instance, shot on location in China, Kōzaburō Yoshimura's Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi, and Sato Takeshi's Chocolate and Soldiers (1938) show the common Japanese soldier as an individual and as a family man, and even enemy Chinese soldiers are presented as individuals, sometimes fighting bravely. Once war with the United States was declared, the Japanese conflict {{became known as the}} Pacific War. Japanese film critics worried that even with Western film techniques, their film output failed to represent native Japanese values. The historian John Dower found that Japanese wartime films had been largely forgotten, as [...] "losers do not get reruns", yet they were so subtle and skilful that Frank Capra thought Chocolate and Soldiers unbeatable. Heroes were typically low-ranking officers, not samurai, calmly devoted to his men and his country. These films did not personalise the enemy and therefore lacked hatred, though Great Britain could figure as the [...] "cultural enemy". For Japanese film-makers, war was not a cause <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a natural disaster, and [...] "what mattered was not whom one fought but how well". Asian enemies, especially the Chinese, were often portrayed as redeemable and even possible marriage partners. Japanese wartime films do not glorify war, but present the Japanese state as one great family and the Japanese people as an [...] "innocent, suffering, self-sacrificing people". Dower comments that the perversity of this image [...] "is obvious: it is devoid of any recognition that, at every level, the Japanese also victimized others." ...|$|E

2500|$|The voiceless {{plosives}} [...] in Latin {{were likely}} less aspirated than voiceless plosives {{at the beginning}} of words in English; for example, Latin [...] was not as strongly aspirated as k in kind <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> k in English sky or look. However, there was no phonemic contrast between voiceless and aspirated plosives in native Latin words, and the voiceless plosives were probably somewhat aspirated at the beginnings of words and near [...] and [...] Some Greek words beginning with the voiceless plosives , when they were borrowed into colloquial Latin, were spelled with the graphemes used to represent voiced plosives b d g , e.g., Latin gubernator besides West Greek [...] (helmsman). That suggests that Latin speakers felt the Greek voiceless plosives to sound less aspirated than their own native equivalents.|$|E
2500|$|Although the New Orleans {{section of}} the River Defense Fleet was wiped out, the eight vessels in the {{northern}} section were able to gain a measure of redemption if not revenge on 10 May 1862, when they surprised the Union Western Gunboat Flotilla in a small action near Plum Point Bend on the Mississippi, a short distance above Fort Pillow. The battle took place about 40 miles (64 kilometers) north of Memphis as the crow flies, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> 50 miles (80 kilometers) on the river.

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1875 Leskov went abroad, first to Paris, then to Prague and Dresden in August. In December his story [...] "At the Edge of the World" [...] was {{published}} in Grazhdanin (1875, No. 52). All the while he continued {{to work on a}} set of stories which would later form his cycle Virtuous Ones. Some critics found Leskov's heroes virtuous beyond belief, but he insisted they were not fantasies, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> reminiscences of his earlier encounters. [...] "I credit myself with having some ability for analyzing characters and their motives, but I'm hopless at fantasizing. Making up things is hard labour for me, so I've always felt the need for having before me real faces which could intrigue me with their spirituality; then they get hold of me and I infuse them with new life, using some real-life stories as a basis," [...] he wrote later in the Varshavsky Dnevnik newspaper. Years of confrontation with critics and many of his colleagues have taken their toll. [...] "Men of letters seem to recognize my writing as a force, but find great pleasure in killing it; in fact they have all but succeeded in killing it off altogether. I write nothing – I just can't!", he wrote to Pyotr Schebalsky in January 1876.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{than the}} $2 coin, the {{denominations}} of Canadian coinage correspond {{to those of}} United States coinage. The sizes of the coins less than 50¢ {{are similar to those}} of U.S. coins, though this was not always the case.

The U.S. penny settled on its current size in 1857, whereas the Canadian penny was much larger (...) until 1920. There was some correspondence between the size of Canadian coins and British coins of similar value.

Likewise, the Canadian quarter (23.81mm diameter) was virtually identical in size and value to the British shilling (worth 12 British pence or about 24 Canadian cents, with a [...] diameter).

In {{defiance}} of the doctor's democratic efforts and election as leader of Ward 1, the bartender declares himself [...] "King of Ward 3" [...] and gains immediate popularity from his [...] "subjects" [...] by prioritizing food over his ward's community responsibilities such as burying the dead. He somehow obtains a revolver and uses it to bully the other wards by controlling the food supply. Meirelles followed the advice of Brazilian stage director Antunes Filho and changed the character from the novel by making him more ambiguous, explaining, [...] "In the book, he is really a mean guy, terribly evil from the beginning... but I thought it was more interesting to have him be not evil <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> {{a child with a}} gun."

He appears cold because he is not an idealist and does not see hope, but he is a survivor, the same as all the others." [...] The doctor's wife kills him with a pair of medical scissors to the neck.
