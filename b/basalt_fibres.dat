Contrary to steel bars, the basalt reinforcement is non-corrosive, non-conductive, and non-magnetic. <b>Basalt</b> <b>fibres</b> can be delivered both as reinforcement bars and as fibre reinforcement, known as Minibars. This report evaluates the use of both basalt rods and <b>basalt</b> <b>fibres</b> in load carrying concrete beams. As {{a part of this}} report, six beams were tested; three pairs with different reinforcement setup. The first pair was lightly reinforced with three Ø 10, 1 bars as longitudinal reinforcement. The second pair was similar to the first, but with 0, 75 vol% added <b>basalt</b> <b>fibres.</b> The third, and last pair, was more heavily reinforced; seven reinforcement bars and 0, 75 vol% added <b>basalt</b> <b>fibres.</b> All beams had dimensions of 200 x 300 x 4000 mm.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{reinforcing}} of Poly(lactic acid) with chopped <b>basalt</b> <b>fibres</b> by using silane treated and untreated <b>basalt</b> <b>fibres.</b> Composite materials with 5 &# 8211; 10 &# 8211; 15 &# 8211; 20 &# 8211; 30 &# 8211; 40 wt% basalt fibre contents were prepared from silane sized <b>basalt</b> <b>fibres</b> using extrusion, and injection moulding, while composites with 5 &# 8211; 10 &# 8211; 15 wt% basalt fibre contents were also prepared by using untreated <b>basalt</b> <b>fibres</b> as control. The properties of the injection moulded composites were extensively examined by using quasi-static (tensile, three-point bending) and dynamic mechanical tests (notched and unnotched Charpy impact tests), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), heat deflection temperature (HDT) analysis, dimensional stability test, as well as melt flow index (MFI) analysis and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) observations. It was found that silane treated chopped <b>basalt</b> <b>fibres</b> are much more effective in reinforcing Poly(lactic acid) than natural fibres; although <b>basalt</b> <b>fibres</b> are not biodegradable {{but they are still}} considered as natural (can be found in nature in the form of volcanic rocks) and biologically inert. It is demonstrated in this paper that by using basalt fibre reinforcement, a renewable and natural resource based composite can be produced by injection moulding with excellent mechanical properties suitable even for engineering applications. Finally it was shown that by using adequate drying of the materials, composites with higher mechanical properties can be achieved compared to literature data...|$|E

It {{was found that}} interface properties between <b>basalt</b> <b>fibre</b> and polyamide 1012 were improved effectively by silane coupling agent. Also, the tensile and flexural strength of treated basalt fibre-reinforced composites {{were found to be}} higher than untreated ones at the same fibre content. The best tensile and flexural strength of polyamide 1012 /treated <b>basalt</b> <b>fibre</b> composites with 30 wt% <b>basalt</b> <b>fibre</b> were determined to be 84. 4 and 120 MPa. Although <b>basalt</b> <b>fibre</b> did not change polyamide 1012 crystal structure, it altered the melting temperature and degree of crystallinity of polyamide 1012. In addition, by virtue of the changes in crystallization temperature, the nucleation ability of polyamide 1012 in composites was confirmed to be enhanced. The strong interaction between epoxy groups of silane coupling agent and amide groups of polyamide 1012 elevates the hydrophobic properties of composites.

However, with the exception of some studies about coupling agent effects on the adhesion between <b>basalt</b> <b>fibres</b> and matrix, no information are present in literature on the wetting characteristics of <b>basalt</b> <b>fibres.</b> The main contribution of this study is the analysis of the surface properties and wetting behaviour of <b>basalt</b> <b>fibres</b> with sizing optimised for both thermoset and thermoplastic matrices.

A thermal-mechanical model was used to compute the softening rate and failure stress of <b>basalt</b> <b>fibre</b> laminates which collapse, when loaded in compression, by either global buckling or material failure when exposed to fire. Fire structural measurements involving one-sided radiant heating with axial compressive loading were also performed.

Furthermore, the fire reaction properties, such as heat release rate and smoke density, were also less favourable for the basalt laminate.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} the behaviour of potassium activators synthesized fly ash geopolymer containing carbon and <b>basalt</b> <b>fibre</b> at ambient and elevated temperature. Six series of fly ash based geopolymer were cast where carbon and <b>basalt</b> <b>fibre</b> were added as 0.5, 1 and 1.5 % by weight of fly ash. One extra control series without any fibre was also cast. Each series of samples were tested {{at ambient temperature}} and also heated at 200, 400, 600 and 800  °C and thus a total of 35 series of samples were tested in this study. The result shows that the geopolymer containing 1  wt% basalt and 1  wt% carbon fibre exhibited better compressive strength, lower volumetric shrinkage and mass loss than other fibre contents. Among two fibres composites, the carbon fibre geopolymer exhibited better performance than its <b>basalt</b> <b>fibre</b> counterpart regardless of temperature. The microstructure of carbon fibre reinforced geopolymer composite is more compact containing fewer pores/voids than its basalt based counterpart at elevated temperatures.

40|$|The use of {{advanced}} {{materials such as}} Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP), for reinforcing (internal reinforcement), prestressing (pre- or post-tensioning) or strengthening (externally bonded, near surface, textile reinforced mortar) of structures, have been gaining increasing interest worldwide. The effectiveness of the FRP techniques have been clearly confirmed by numerous experimental and field applications. This study focuses on the possible use of <b>basalt</b> <b>fibres</b> for FRP rebars or laminates. Basalt is a volcanic igneous rock that because of its high performance in terms of strength, corrosion resistance, temperature range, fire resistance and durability as well as lower potential, cost may effectively replace steel, glass and carbon fibres in many applications. The paper discusses, based on a literature review and some feasibility tests, the possible use of <b>basalt</b> <b>fibres</b> in relation to reinforcing and strengthening of concrete. Herewith, reference is made to (1) basalt fibre composite bars or rods for internal reinforcement, (2) the possibility to use short <b>basalt</b> <b>fibres,</b> and (3) strengthening of concrete members by means of externally bonded reinforcement (EBR), near surface mounted reinforcement (NSM) or textile reinforced mortar reinforcement (TRM).

30|$|It {{can be seen}} in the {{experiment}} that the measured compressive strength of basalt fibre composite at ambient temperature is lower than its carbon fibre counterpart. There is also established correlation between reduction in compressive strength and presence of higher air voids in cementitious composites (Lian et al. 2011; Santos et al. 2017). Therefore, the lower ambient temperature compressive strength of basalt fibre geopolymer composite than carbon fibre geopolymer composite indicate higher amount of pores/voids in the former than the latter and upon heating at various elevated temperatures the moisture evaporated from these pores increased the porosity. This has also been observed in the MIP and SEM tests. It is also found that the fibre content of 1  wt% in both basalt and carbon geopolymer composites exhibited higher ambient as well as elevated temperatures compressive strengths, lower mass loss and lower volumetric shrinkage than other fibre contents e.g., 0.5 and 1.5 % in this study. Based on above discussion it is clear that the likelihood of higher pores/voids in geopolymer composites containing 1.5  wt% carbon and <b>basalt</b> <b>fibres</b> is higher than that containing 1  wt% of carbon and <b>basalt</b> <b>fibres,</b> which caused lower compressive strength at ambient as well as at elevated temperatures. Similar results are also observed in the case of mass loss. However, the composites containing 1.5  wt% carbon and <b>basalt</b> <b>fibres</b> shrinks slightly more than other fibre contents which is not clear and deserve more research in future.|$|E

The core constituent of the proposed methodology is the identification of the markets for the designed products, as well as the pre-setting of their properties and assurance of their stability over the time. The foamed fibre concrete technology represents modified procedures of preparation of the foam, the mineral component, and the basalt fiber, the blending of the components, their casting and heat treatment. The process-related parameters were subjected to double-staged analysis: Stage 1 represented an experiment encompassing the whole process.

40|$|Due to the {{ever-increasing}} {{application of}} polymer composites in several industrial {{fields and the}} environmental requirements for reinforcements in polymer matrices, the reinforcement potential of newer fibres is currently investigated. During the last decade, the possible use of <b>basalt</b> <b>fibres</b> as reinforcing material for polymers has been studied extensively. <b>Basalt</b> <b>fibres</b> are produced by melt-spinning from naturally existing basalt rocks which are volcanic and effusive rocks saturated with 45 - 52 wt% SiO 2. Due to its origin, basalt fibre shows excellent properties: high Young’s modulus, excellent heat resistance, good insulation properties (acoustic and thermal) and good damping characteristics. Impact resistance of composite materials is an important area of research. Fibre reinforced polymer composites (FRP) typically show poor resistance to impact events. Moreover, uncertainties about the dominant mechanisms of damage {{make it difficult to}} assess the effect of impact on the performance and residual strength of FRPs. This situation is {{compounded by the fact that}} often the damage produced is not visible. It is therefore essential to understand the impact behaviour of composites to properly design and use them. The primary focus of this research has been aimed at investigating the response to low velocity impact of two different laminates, namely a glass and a basalt woven fabric reinforced vinylester composites. The specimens were manufactured by Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM), using 14 layers of glass and <b>basalt</b> <b>fibres</b> and keeping constant the laminate thickness (3 mm). Plain woven glass and basalt fabrics were used as reinforcement with the same fibre areal weight (220 g/m 2) for comparison purposes. An epoxy based vinylester resin was used as matrix material.

40|$|The {{utilization}} of high strength concrete {{to support the}} tall building construction industry is increasing. Nevertheless, the use of Portland cement in concrete industry {{is one of the}} CO 2 emission sources. Hence, significant increase of the use of fly ash as a cementitious material for partially replacing cement will lead to a significant impact in reducing the greenhouse gas emission. On the other hand, high strength concrete has one main weakness, the increase of relative brittleness. This weakness could be balanced by adding fibres in it. One of the new types of <b>fibres</b> is <b>basalt</b> <b>fibre</b> that has good resistance to chemical attack, and good resistance in impact load and fire. This research deploys design of experiment method to examine the use of low water binder ratio in producing high strength mortar using high volume ultra fine fly ash (HVUFFA). At this stage, the study on using saturated lime water as mixing water in mortar was conducted to investigate the strength development of fly ash lime mortar. It was found that the use of saturated lime water in high volume ultra fine fly ash mortar gives the same strength and strength development as those in ordinary Portland cement (OPC) mortar. The experiment was continued by further investigation on the use of lime water, high volume ultra fine fly ash and the use of <b>basalt</b> <b>fibre</b> to produce high strength concrete. The design experiment method was used to study how each factor gave influence on concrete properties and to find out the optimum mix design in producing high performance concrete using HVUFFA incorporated with <b>basalt</b> <b>fibre.</b> The test comprised the strength and durability test of high strength concrete. The result shows that the brittleness of <b>basalt</b> <b>fibre</b> in alkali environment made it inappropriate to use as concrete fibre. Besides, the combination of using high volume fly ash concrete and lime water can produce high strength concrete with high performance properties as it increases compressive strength development and enhances the durability of concrete, especially in reducing chloride ion penetrability...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{hot-pressing}} {{technique for}} the manufacturing of <b>basalt</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced glass matrix composites was investigated. Two-dimensional (2 D) fibre mats were sandwiched between borosilicate glass powder layers, thus configuring a much simpler processing route than that commonly employed {{for the production}} of fibre-reinforced glasses. Besides economic benefits, the use of fibre mats may lead to technologic advantages due to the possibility of readily coating the fibres with a suitable material (e. g. titanium oxide) by means of the sol-gel method. The coating of <b>basalt</b> <b>fibre</b> mats with TiO 2 is proposed for preventing the fibres from an excessive adhesion to the glass matrix. The developed composites containing 15 vol% of 2 D-fibre reinforcement exhibited promising bending strength (~ 90 MPa) and desirable “graceful” fracture behaviour without catastrophic failure. Thus the present study represents a convenient approach for production of advanced low-cost fibre reinforced glass matrix composites for structural applications...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of strengthening RC slabs using <b>basalt</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced epoxy laminate. <b>Basalt</b> <b>fibre</b> was recently introduced and its mechanical properties are similar to glass fibre reinforced plastic. In this study, two design configurations of cross-shape and square-collar laminate were used to strengthen RC slabs. Experimental results showed that the square-collar laminate was much more effective in improving the load carrying capability as well as in reducing the deflection at mid-length. Test results of RC slabs strengthened with the cross-shape configuration showed no strengthening effect. This could be due to the premature failure of the laminate in the high stress area at intersection. Analysis of the designs using finite element model correlated very well with the experimental results. The analytical. results also showed uneven distribution of the stress level in the laminate of cross-shape configuration which might cause the premature failure...|$|R
