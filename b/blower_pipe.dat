5000|$|In 1961 Sydney Allard {{built the}} Allard dragster in the UK and its first {{competitive}} appearance {{was at the}} Brighton Speed Trials on 2 September 1961. A new track record over the kilometre was anticipated but a fuel line ruptured caused a misfire and a time of 37.91 secs. Hot Rod Magazine reported: [...] "During warmup it backfired and blew off one set of <b>blower</b> <b>pipes</b> and never got going." [...] The reputation of the car never fully recovered, and Bill Boddy, editor of Motor Sport, called it a fiasco, saying the mechanical problems had also occurred in testing at Boreham. The Autocar described the Allard dragster as a [...] "gallant failure." ...|$|R

40|$|Disease in prawn is any {{abnormal}} condition {{which may}} affect adversely the appearance, growth, {{and function of}} the animal. It {{may or may not}} result in mortalities. Disease outbreaks occur commonly in different culture systems such as hatcheries and grow-out ponds. Disease develops through the interaction of the prawn (the host), the causal agent (the pathogen), and the environment. In the presence of a susceptible host, a pathogen and predisposing environmental conditions (poor water quality, inadequate food, frequent handling, overstocking), disease is very likely to occur. Improved environmental conditions, healthy prawns and absence of disease agents would therefore lessen the chance of a disease outbreak. The causal agents may be pathogenic organisms (viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, helminths, microcrustaceans) or nonpathogenic adverse environmental conditions (extreme temperatures, low oxygen levels, chemical poisons). Living disease agents cause infectious disease which generally result in gradual mortalities. Non-living disease agents cause non-infectious diseases that result in sudden mass mortalities. The environment determines the balance between the prawn as host and the disease agent. Microorganisms are always present in the water and some of them cause disease only when the prawn has been weakened through exposure to stressful environmental conditions. Hatchery personnel should realize that they themselves could transmit disease through their contaminated hands, clothing, and footwear. Equipment such as water pumps, <b>blowers,</b> <b>pipes,</b> and materials such as scoop nets, water hoses, pails, glasswares are also possible carriers of disease agents. Spawners, live natural food like diatoms, rotifers and brine shrimp, and artificial diets could also be vehicles of disease transmission. The prawn culturist, thus, must be able to manage the environment and make it favorable for the prawn. Hatchery management should, therefore, include operation procedures that will reduce the possibility of disease development during larval rearing. This manual recommends practices for disease prevention to prawn hatchery operators and technicians...|$|R
5000|$|At the {{completion}} of filming, the producers could not pay all the creditors, so the black Interceptor was put up for sale. [...] The <b>blower</b> and side <b>pipes</b> were removed to make it suitable {{for use as a}} road vehicle. It was then used as a promotional car for the film, before finally being put up for sale. However the car did not sell and was passed on to part-time actor and motor mechanic Murray Smith, who was the head mechanic for the movies production team, as payment for his services.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Statistics Canada {{stated that}} the {{wastewater}} treatment facilities in most provinces are aging and passes 63 % of their useful life in 2007 the highest ratio among public infrastructure assets. Currently, there is no standard condition rating system for wastewater treatment plants that give a specific rating index that describe the physical integrity of different infrastructure elements in the treatment plant and its environmental performance. The main objective {{of this study is}} to develop a condition-rating index for wastewater treatment plants mainly activated sludge systems. The proposed WWTP CRI, is based on dividing the treatment plant into its three treatment phases; primary phase, secondary phase and the tertiary phase. The condition-rating index will reflect the infrastructures state for each phase, mainly tanks, <b>pipes,</b> <b>blowers</b> and pumps.

40|$|One of {{the ways}} to {{preserve}} energy on the air plane is by decreasing the drag. Drag is closely related to the flow separation, the faster the separation, then the drag will increase more. Because of that, efforts were conducted to decrease drag is by manipulating a fluid flow field that is by installing triangle rod obstacle in front of the cylinder. The purpose of this research is to analyze the effect of installing triangle rod obstacle in front of the cylinder by various air flow velocity on the drag cofficient. In this research, the experiment was conducted in the wind tunnel, which consists of <b>blower,</b> pitot <b>pipe,</b> manometer, cylinder pipe, and triangle rod. The air flow velocity was varied from 6. 25 m/s, 5. 01 m/s, 4. 09 m/s, 3. 17 m/s, 2. 24 m/s. The Reynold number based on cylinder (D = 42 mm) and air flow velocity is Re = 18. 100, 14. 500, 11. 800, 9. 170, 6. 480. The distance triangle rod and cylinder is L = 70 mm or L/D= 1. 67. Pressure distribution is achieved by measuring the cylinder surface on 36 spots with interval of 100. The measured data was pressure of cylinder surface, static pressure, and airflow speed. The research results showed that the triangle rod could decrease the drag of cylinder. Coefficient drag for cylinder without triangle rod was 0, 1276 while the less triangle rod was 0, 01882 which takes place at speed 6, 2479 m/s...|$|R
2500|$|During {{the initial}} diving operations, a prop-wash <b>blower</b> (metal <b>pipe</b> fitted over the {{propeller}} to deflect its force {{down to the}} seafloor) was used, ostensibly to improve water visibility by forcing surface water down towards the bottom. [...] It was later decided by the archaeologists that the blower should be turned off as it was visibly damaging the delicate material of the cargo remains. [...] It is not known exactly how much sediment covered the shipwreck {{at the time of}} its discovery because the prop-wash blower was deployed before sending divers down. [...] The first team of divers reported feeling musket balls on the seafloor along with loose fragments of wood moving in the current created by the blower. [...] These materials strongly suggested that this was indeed a shipwreck site. [...] During the second dive, archaeologist Chuck Meide discovered a bronze cannon which, when subsequently recovered, proved that this shipwreck was indeed that of La Belle. The cannon was ornately decorated, and bore the crest of King Louis and the Count of Vermandois, the Admiral of France. An illegitimate son of Louis XIV, Vermandois served as Admiral of the French fleet until his death in 1683, meaning the cannon would have been cast no later than 1683, the time when La Salle was preparing for his voyage. [...] This was considered strong circumstantial evidence that the ship was La Belle. [...] A serial number on the gun (and two others found in 1997) was later matched in a French archival record discovered by Dr. John de Bry with the numbers of four bronze cannons that had been loaded onto La Belle, providing definitive proof of the wreck's identity.|$|R
40|$|In High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors thermal {{insulating}} {{systems are}} installed. The components {{of these systems}} are forced to mechanical vibrations by <b>blower</b> noise or <b>pipe</b> flow. In this paper the coupling between a liner insulation and a sound field has been investigated in air and helium at static pressure up to 50 bars and SPL up to 160 dB. In the theoretical part it is shown that, by applying the law of acoustic reciprocity, the response of a structure in a diffuse sound field can be calculated. The main parameter influencing the coupling between a sound field and a structure is the radiation efficiency of the structure. The highest degree of coupling occurs at the coincidence frequency. In the experimental part the radiation efficiency of a cover plate insulation was measured. Then the system was exited by narrow - or broadband noise, and the structure response was measured. The experimental results and theoretical predictions are in theorie and experiment. From Theorie and experiment a modelling rule was derived. This rule shows under which conditions model test must be performed and how {{the results can be}} extropolated to original reactor conditions...|$|R
5000|$|In June 1995 the Texas Historical Commission {{organized}} a second magnetometer survey to search high-probability areas {{not included in}} earlier surveys.

This survey lasted the entire month and utilized a Geometrics 866 proton precession magnetometer which identified 39 [...] "magnetic features that required further investigation".

5000|$|She {{was also}} active as a sculptor, {{and a student}} of J. P. Molin. Some of her designs were made into {{porcelain}} ornaments in Rörstrand and Gustavsberg. Her mothers refusal {{to allow her to}} study human anatomy created difficulties to develop this talent as well. This was partially solved after an incident described by Fritz von Dardel. Upon a visit to the princess, he discovered that she was sculpturing a small statue of soldier in clay. She used the uniform of a soldier as a model, but this was not sufficient, as the legs of the soldiers did not look realistic. To assist her, Fritz von Dardel modeled his legs for her. They were interrupted by the queen dowager, who did not approve of a male model. The statue, however, which depicted a Norwegian <b>pipe</b> <b>blower,</b> turned out well after Dardel had modeled for it, and was made into a porcelain statue at Rörstrand. The incident of Dardel's modeling for Eugenie also proved benefiting for her development as an artist: after this, her mother allowed her to study the human anatomy of children, who were allowed to model for her. The perhaps most known piece of art attributed to her is a porcelain figurine of a dog and a child sitting opposite each other, entitled »Kan du inte tala?» ("Can't You Speak?"), which was manufactured at Gustavsberg and became a popular ornament.She also designed an allegory of faith and the apostles of Peter and Paul for her mother's chapel. Her work was represented at the Stockholm Art Exhibition of 1866. [...] In November 1873, she was induced an honorary member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts.|$|R
