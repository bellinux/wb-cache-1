40|$|The {{statistical}} disclosure attack (SDA) is an eective {{method for}} compromising {{the anonymity of}} users in a mix based system. Cover traffic, in the form o ake or dummy messages sent by other users of the mix, is an eective defense to make {{the task of the}} attacker difficult. Our aim is to examine the eect that <b>background</b> <b>cover</b> – the cover traffic sent by other users – has on the eectiveness of statistical disclosure attacks. Since the original SDA does not ex-plicitly account for background traffic volumes, we developed an extension to the SDA called SDA- 2 H that uses this information to improve upon the SDA. Based on this attack, we are able to quan-tify the importance of <b>background</b> <b>cover</b> traffic, which we show in simulation to be eective in many scenarios.

5000|$|When the Killers {{first started}} out, their music was little noticed by music buyers and the media, {{which is why}} [...] "Somebody Told Me" [...] has been {{released}} twice in slightly different forms.

50|$|During the Roman {{period the}} cameo {{technique}} was used on glass blanks, {{in imitation of}} objects being produced in agate or sardonyx. Cameo glass objects were produced in two periods; between around 25 BC and 50/60 AD, and in the later Empire around the mid-third and mid-fourth century. Roman glass cameos are rare objects, with only around two hundred fragments and sixteen complete pieces known, only one of which dates from the later period. During the early period they usually consisted of a blue glass base with a white overlying layer, but those made during the later period usually have a colourless <b>background</b> <b>covered</b> with a translucent coloured layer. Blanks could be produced by fusing two separately cast sheets of glass, or by dipping the base glass into a crucible of molten overlay glass during blowing. The most famous example of a cameo from the early period is the Portland Vase.|$|E

As his parents are divorced, Sport lives with his father who is a struggling writer who has been focusing on a book (a big gamble) rather than the steady income of journal/newspaper articles, with Sport managing their finances. Their financial problems are exacerbated once Sport's grandfather Simon Vane (from his mother's side) becomes terminally ill and stops sending regular payments to Sport. Things {{change for the better}} once Sport's father meets the kind Kate who becomes a good stepmother. However Simon's will has named Sport as the main beneficiary to the $30 million family fortune, much to the chagrin of Sport's mother Charlotte Vane and her sister. Charlotte, an absentee mother who has been living well abroad in Europe most of the time, returns to New York City upon hearing of her father's illness, scheming to increase her share of Simon's inheritance by kidnapping Sport and imprisoning him in the Plaza Hotel for a week.|$|E
