40|$|We generalize the Pastawski-Yoshida-Harlow-Preskill (HaPPY) {{holographic}} quantum error-correcting code {{to provide}} a toy model for bulk gauge fields or linearized gravitons. The key new elements are the introduction of degrees of freedom on the links (edges) of the associated tensor network and their connection to further copies of the HaPPY code by an appropriate isometry. The result is a model in which <b>boundary</b> <b>regions</b> allow the reconstruction of bulk algebras with central elements living on the interior edges of the (greedy) entanglement wedge, and where these central elements can also be reconstructed from complementary <b>boundary</b> <b>regions.</b> In addition, the entropy of <b>boundary</b> <b>regions</b> receives both Ryu-Takayanagi-like contributions and further corrections that model the δArea/ 4 G_N term of Faulkner, Lewkowycz, and Maldacena.

40|$|In {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the {{establishment}} and maintenance of silent chromatin at the telomere requires a delicate balance between opposing activities of histone modifying enzymes. Previously, we demonstrated that the protein arginine methyltransferase Hmt 1 {{plays a role in}} the formation of yeast silent chromatin. To better understand the nature of the Hmt 1 interactions that contribute to this phenomenon, we carried out a systematic reverse genetic screen using a null allele of HMT 1 and the synthetic genetic array (SGA) methodology. This screen revealed interactions between HMT 1 and genes encoding components of the histone deacetylase complex Rpd 3 L (large). A double mutant carrying both RPD 3 and HMT 1 deletions display increased telomeric silencing and Sir 2 occupancy at the telomeric <b>boundary</b> <b>regions,</b> when comparing to a single mutant carrying Hmt 1 -deletion only. However, the dual rpd 3 /hmt 1 -null mutant behaves like the rpd 3 -null single mutant with respect to silencing behavior, indicating that RPD 3 is epistatic to HMT 1. Mutants lacking either Hmt 1 or its catalytic activity display an increase in the recruitment of histone deacetylase Rpd 3 to the telomeric <b>boundary</b> <b>regions.</b> Moreover, in such loss-of-function mutants the levels of acetylated H 4 K 5, which is a substrate of Rpd 3, are altered at the telomeric <b>boundary</b> <b>regions.</b> In contrast, the level of acetylated H 4 K 16, a target of the histone deacetylase Sir 2, was increased in these regions. Interestingly, mutants lacking either Rpd 3 or Sir 2 display various levels of reduction in dimethylated H 4 R 3 at these telomeric <b>boundary</b> <b>regions.</b> Together, these data provide insight into the mechanism whereb...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new structure-based interest region detector called Shape-Stable <b>Region</b> <b>Boundaries</b> (SSRB) which we use for object class recognition. The SSRB interest operator detects stable <b>boundary</b> <b>regions</b> within the multi-scale morphological image representation [1]. To detect robust <b>boundary</b> <b>regions,</b> we perform multi-scale analysis via anisotropic diffusion operators to preserve boundaries and guarantee invariance to affine transformations. We extract the transition {{boundaries of the}} diffusivity velocity map and track their evolution at each level of the scale-space. The stability of the boundary shape is subsequently estimated through a minimization process over different scales. Unlike most {{state of the art}} detectors which use the Gaussian scale space for multi-scale image representation, our approach is intrinsically affine invariant [1]. Experiments on different benchmark datasets show that SSRB is comparable or superior to state-of the art detectors for both feature matching and object recognition. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R
