40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of hatching month on the hatching features of <b>Bronze</b> <b>turkeys,</b> and to determine the suitable months for hatching. For this purpose, the hatching records of <b>Bronze</b> <b>turkeys</b> raised in the Bingl Beekeeping and Turkey Production Station from 1998 to 2003 were used. Egg fertility and hatchability of both total eggs and of fertile eggs were investigated, and it was found that the effect of hatching month on all 3 variables was statistically significant. The results regarding all 3 variables were lower in June as compared to the other months investigated. For this reason, it was concluded that hatching should not be performed in June, when temperatures increase sharply...|$|R

50|$|The Narragansett has plumage with black, gray, tan, {{and white}} {{feathers}}. It resembles the <b>Bronze</b> <b>turkey</b> but has feathers of gray or dull black replacing the Bronze's distinctive coppery coloring.

It has a black beard, a horn-colored beak, and a mostly featherless head and neck which range in color from red to blueish white.|$|E
50|$|The Bronze is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} turkey. The name refers to its plumage, which bears an iridescent bronze-like sheen. The Bronze {{had been the}} most popular turkey throughout most of American history, but waned in popularity beginning in the mid-20th century. Later in its history, the breed was divided into two distinct types: the Broad Breasted Bronze and the Standard Bronze. A great deal of confusion exists about the difference between Standard and Broad Breasted Bronzes, or that there is any difference at all. Collectively, the Standard and Broad Breasted varieties are simply called the <b>Bronze</b> <b>turkey.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Bronze turkeys are {{the product}} of {{crossing}} domestic turkeys brought from England, with the wild turkey. These matings produced a bird that was larger and more robust than the European turkeys, and tamer than wild turkeys. Though the <b>Bronze</b> <b>turkey</b> type was created in the 18th century, the actual name was not used until the 1830s, when a strain developed in the U.S. state of Rhode Island was named the Point Judith Bronze. The name later spread to be used in reference to the breed as a whole, and was in the process simplified to just [...] "Bronze". In the British Isles, the Bronze was associated with Cambridge, and was called the Cambridge Bronze, but again this name has been simplified to just [...] "Bronze".|$|E
50|$|The Bronze {{was first}} {{admitted}} into the American Poultry Association's Standard of Perfection in 1874.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to provide {{information}} on the genetic variability of the Hungarian <b>Bronze</b> <b>turkey</b> gene reserve population and its difference from the Broad-breasted turkey, and offer guidance and proposals for its future conservation strategies. Altogether, 239 Hungarian Bronze turkeys from 10 strains and 13 Broad-breasted turkeys as a control population were genotyped for 15 microsatellites.

40|$|PROGRESS in the {{determination}} of causes of embryo mortality seems to be dependent in a measure upon accurate knowledge of the metab olism of the developing embryo. A {{review of the literature}} of this subject is given by Needham (1). EXPERIMENTALMETHOD The <b>Bronze</b> <b>turkey</b> eggs used in this experiment were produced at the Western Kentucky Experiment Substation at Princeton, Kentucky. They were collected for a period of thirteen days, shipped to Lexington, Ken tucky, and placed in an electric (Petersime) incubator. The average tem perature was 99. 75 Â°F. throughout the period of incubation with a relative humidity of 64 per cent. All eggs were turned four times daily. At twenty-four hour intervals, six eggs weighing 80 to 90 grams each were removed and stored in a refrigeration room at 28 to 30 Â°F. This effectively stopped embryonic development and preserved the eggs until analyzed at a later date. The embryos were removed from the eggs, compared with previously standardized specimens, freed of all adhering yolk, including that within the body cavity, dried on filter paper, transferred to silica dishes, weighed, and dried to a constant weight in an electric oven at 100 C. Â°The dry em bryos were burned to a white ash, which was dissolved in hydrochloric acid, made to a definite volume with distilled water, and calcium and phosphorus determined in separate aliquots.
