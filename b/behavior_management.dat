2500|$|Task {{analysis}} {{is a process}} in which a task is analyzed into its component parts so that those parts can be taught through the use of chaining: forward chaining, backward chaining and total task presentation. Task analysis has been used in organizational <b>behavior</b> <b>management,</b> a behavior analytic approach to changing the behaviors of members of an organization (e.g., factories, offices, or hospitals). Behavioral scripts often emerge from a task analysis. Bergan conducted a task analysis of the behavioral consultation relationship and Thomas Kratochwill developed a training program based on teaching Bergan's skills. A similar approach was used for the development of microskills training for counselors. Ivey would later call this [...] "behaviorist" [...] phase a very productive one and the skills-based approach came to dominate counselor training during 1970–90. Task analysis was also used in determining the skills needed to access a career. In education, Englemann (1968) used task analysis as part of the methods to design the Direct Instruction curriculum.|$|E

Methods: The {{data were collected from}} May 12 to 20 2010 using self-report questionnaires about time <b>management</b> <b>behavior</b> and self-efficacy of nursing students. The data from 508 students were analyzed using descriptive analysis, K-means clustering, and one-way ANOVA. Results: The mean score for time <b>management</b> <b>behavior</b> was 3. 03 ± 1. 11 out of a possible 5, and self-efficacy was 3. 65 ± 0. 42 out of a possible 6.

40|$|Objective. Weight gain after cancer {{treatment}} {{is associated with}} breast cancer recurrence. In order to prolong cancer-free survivorship, interventions to manage post-diagnosis weight are sometimes conducted. However, {{little is known about}} what factors are associated with weight <b>management</b> <b>behaviors</b> among cancer survivors. In this study, we examined associations of demographic, clinical, and psychosocial variables with weight <b>management</b> <b>behaviors</b> in female breast cancer survivors. We also examined whether knowledge about post-diagnosis weight gain and its risk is associated with weight <b>management</b> <b>behaviors.</b> ^ Methods. 251 female breast cancer survivors completed an internet survey. They reported current performance of three weight <b>management</b> <b>behaviors</b> (general weight <b>management,</b> physical activity, and healthy diet). We also measured attitude, elf-efficacy, knowledge and social support regarding these behaviors along with demographic and clinical characteristics. ^ Results. Multiple regression models for the weight <b>management</b> <b>behaviors</b> explained 17 % of the variance in general weight management, 45 % in physical activity and 34 % in healthy dieting. The models had 9 – 14 predictor variables which differed in each model. The variables associated with all three behaviors were social support and self-efficacy. Self-efficacy showed the strongest contribution in all models. The knowledge about weight gain and its risks was not associated with any weight <b>management</b> <b>behaviors.</b> However, women who obtained the knowledge during {{cancer treatment}} were {{more likely to engage in}} physical activity and healthy dieting. ^ Conclusions. The findings suggest that an intervention designed to increase their self-efficacy to manage weight, to be physically active, to eat healthy will effectively promote survivors to engage in these behaviors. Knowledge may motivate women to manage post-diagnosis weight about risk if information is provided during cancer treatment. ...|$|R
