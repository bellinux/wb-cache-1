5|$|Early in the {{development}} of Dick Tracy, Beatty decided to make the film using a palette limited to just seven colors, primarily red, green, blue and yellow—to evoke the film's comic strip origins; furthermore each of the colors was to <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same shade. Beatty's design team included production designer Richard Sylbert, set decorator Rick Simpson, cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (whom Beatty had worked with on his previous film, Ishtar, as producer and lead actor), visual effects supervisors Michael Lloyd and Harrison Ellenshaw, prosthetic makeup designers John Caglione, Jr. and Doug Drexler, and costume designer Milena Canonero. Their main intention was to stay close to Chester Gould's original drawings from the 1930s. Other influences came from the Art Deco movement and German Expressionism.|$|E

25|$|In Superman Returns, Brandon Routh {{takes over}} the role of Superman. Director Bryan Singer had stated that this film's {{continuity}} is based only loosely on the first two Superman films directed by Richard Donner and Richard Lester, and thus Reeve and Routh's Supermen, though similar in places (even having identical fathers—Jor-El played by Marlon Brando and Jonathan Kent played by Glenn Ford), may not <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same individual. For example, the events of the third and fourth films, including also a movie spin-off from 1984 called Supergirl, are ignored.|$|E
25|$|The two teams' total ratings {{is almost}} exactly the same after the series (119.4+90.5=209.9) as before the series (120+90=210). The series has {{therefore}} not generated any extra ratings, but has just redistributed the ratings the two teams already had. When these ratings are published in the official table in their rounded form (119 and 91), the total ratings after the series will <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same as before the series. There is therefore no points 'inflation' in this system, which means that comparisons of ratings over time are meaningful.|$|E
25|$|Bioequivalence {{does not}} mean generic drugs must <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same as the brand-name product ("pharmaceutical equivalent"). Chemical {{differences}} may exist; a different salt or estermay be used, for instance. However, the therapeutic effect of the drug must be the same ("pharmaceutical alternative"). Most small molecule drugs are accepted as bioequivalent if their pharmacokinetic parameters of area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) are within a 90% confidence interval of 80–125%; most approved generics are well within this limit. For more complex products—such as inhalers, patch delivery systems, liposomal preparations, or biosimilar drugs—demonstrating pharmacodynamic or clinical equivalence is more challenging.|$|E

25|$|When the {{original}} sound sources are perfectly periodic, the note consists of several related sine waves (which mathematically add to each other) called the fundamental and the harmonics, partials, or overtones. The sounds have harmonic frequency spectra. The lowest frequency present is the fundamental, {{and is the}} frequency at which the entire wave vibrates. The overtones vibrate faster than the fundamental, but must vibrate at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency for the total wave to <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same each cycle. Real instruments are close to periodic, but the frequencies of the overtones are slightly imperfect, so {{the shape of the}} wave changes slightly over time.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{produced}} by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had served as showrunners of seasons three and four. They returned to the show to produce this and several other episodes while under contract with The Walt Disney Company. The episode was written by Reid Harrison and directed by Steven Dean Moore. It {{had one of the}} longest episode gaps between its conception to the time it was finished. The idea was first conceived at a story retreat. Jean found a copy of TV Guide while in the bathroom, with The X-Files on the cover. Feeling a crossover would be a good idea, he came back into the room, told Reiss his idea, and the pair pitched it. None of the other staff wanted to do it, so Reiss and Jean decided to do it themselves. Before the episode was produced, the script was sent to Chris Carter, the creator of The X-Files, who said that it was an [...] "honor" [...] to be satirized by The Simpsons. Jean was worried that the episode was not funny, as at the table reading {{there were only a few}} of the writers present and as such, the script got no laughs at all. It took a long time to come up with an ending, and an explanation for the alien. Originally, it was just going to be left as a mystery. Mulder and Scully's office was designed to <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same as the one used in The X-Files. After it had been finished, Fox sent the episode out for a critical review, which was [...] "really great". The scene with the [...] "Homer is a dope" [...] T-shirts originally had an extra line: [...] "I told you, we're sold out!", thus filling in the plot error in the actual episode in which Homer asks for some T-shirts, despite just being told that they were sold out. The scene after Homer's first encounter with the alien, in which he runs through a field writing [...] "Yahhh!" [...] in the grass, was written by David M. Stern, and added in after the original read through.|$|E

Imagine now that the behavior is altruistic. The success of such a trait in sufficiently intelligent and undeceived organisms is implicit.

2500|$|By this time, {{however, the}} taste in French art for a cool and {{classical}} form of Baroque that {{had set in}} from the 1620s was already reducing the appreciation of Bellange, whose reputation continued to fall, along with that of Mannerism in general. For the same reason, there are no artists who {{can be seen to}} have been directly influenced by Bellange's style. Unlike the Dutch and Italians, French artists had no large collection of biographies until {{the latter part of the}} century, but the great print collector Michel de Marolles was aware of 47 or 48 prints by Bellange, most of which were in his collections; these would not <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same as the 47 or 48 in modern works, but very largely so. By the mid-18th century, the great French authority Pierre-Jean Mariette was scornful and dismissive: [...] "Bellange is one of those painters whose licentious manner, completely removed from a proper style, deserves great distrust. It nevertheless had its admirers, and Bellange had a great vogue. ... Several pieces by him are known, which one cannot bear to look at, so bad is their taste". Many biographical compendiums simply omitted him, even as late as the 1920s. Another judgment of 1767 was quoted with approval by A. P. F. Robert-Dumesnil in his biographical dictionary Le Peintre-Graveur Français (1841), complaining that Bellange's etchings had [...] "much more bizarreness than judgment, and very little correctness". However, Robert-Dumesnil did recognise that his style had something in common with the Romantics.|$|E
