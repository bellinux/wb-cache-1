40|$|Abstract. <b>Branch</b> <b>root</b> {{development}} on the primary root of maize (Zea mays L.) seedlings was followed for 9 d after planting. This period includes the shift from seedling heterotrophy to autotrophy. Linear density of branches in the basal region ranged from ∼ 38 cm− 1 at the base to ∼ 10 cm− 1 beyond 10 cm. Branch roots in the first ∼ 8 cm were produced before assimilate was available. Branch length decreased from ∼ 26 mm at 1 cm along the primary root to ∼ 8 mm at 10 cm from the base. Without the cotyledon, <b>branch</b> <b>root</b> density in the basal region was ∼ 10 cm− 1 and roots were short (∼ 5 mm). Beyond 8 – 10 cm both measurements matched those of intact seedlings. Dark-grown seedlings had basal <b>branch</b> <b>root</b> densities higher than those without cotyledons but none beyond 10 cm. There were more and smaller diameter sieve tubes in the basal region of the primary root. These decreased distally in number but had larger diameters where branches formed after assimilate was available. Proliferation of basal branch roots in very young seedlings can have major advantages for successful seedling establishment {{in the field and}} could be screened for without difficulty...|$|E

Canopy shape and density were variable with some species having a bushy shrub-like appearance and others more streamlined canopies and forms. In a similar manner, the below-ground appearance of the root systems was also variable. Several species had low root density (i.e. low numbers of roots per m 2 of soil) and elongated “spidery” lateral roots with few small side <b>branches</b> (low <b>root</b> <b>branching</b> order) (blackwood, eucalypt, oak) (Fig.  3). Alder and cherry had dense <b>branching</b> lateral <b>root</b> systems with high root numbers (high root density and high root order) while redwood and cypress had similar dense root systems, but many fine long <b>branching</b> <b>roots.</b> Radiata had long laterals with limited branching order, similar to blackwood but with {{a greater number of}} short <b>branch</b> <b>roots</b> on the main laterals.

40|$|In literature, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that new branch roots are produced in a woody parental along its axis not only in the proximal zone where a primary anatomical structure is present but even where old branch roots are present, and a thick production of wood internally characterizes the parental root anatomy. This paper confirms this hypothesis by showing, for the first time, the presence of a new <b>branch</b> <b>root</b> primordium forming within the secondary phloem tissues of a woody parental root. The new <b>branch</b> <b>root</b> primordia found in this work are designated secondary branch roots (SBRs) and seem to develop from derivatives of the vascular cambium that abandon the formation of conducting elements to become the mother cells of these new root primordia. We find that traces belonging to SBRs present some anatomical difference compared with those belonging to branch roots deriving from primary tissues designated, according to literature, primary branch roots (PBRs). This difference in traces could help to distinguish between the origin of the SBRs and PBRs present along a woody parental axis, and this could be helpful in understanding how the root system of a woody plant is developed. The possibility of branching, wherever needed, along the root axes, independently of their internal anatomical organization, evokes a new scenario in which woody plants, in analogy with herbaceous plants, continuously modify their root system in an attempt to adapt and to better exploit their rooting environment...|$|E
40|$|<b>Branch</b> <b>root</b> {{formation}} {{required only}} {{the presence of}} minerals, sucrose as a carbon source, and an auxin. The number of primordia formed was a function of auxin concentration. With naphthaleneacetic acid at 0. 1 mg/l, up to 60 or more branches were formed per centimeter of Haplopappus ravenii root segment. Under our conditions, pea root segments formed only five or six branches per centimeter, but tomato and radish, like H. ravenii, formed large numbers of branches. Cytokinin inhibited branch formation, while gibberellic acid was without effect. Vitamins were not required for branch formation, although they enhanced elongation. Up to 5 days were required for {{the maximum number of}} stable branch primordia to form under the influence of naphthaleneacetic acid. If naphthaleneacetic acid was withdrawn earlier, fewer branch primordia developed. The requirement for a lengthy exposure to naphthaleneacetic acid, the kinetics of the response, and the ease with which naphthaleneacetic acid could be rinsed out of the tissue with consequent cessation of <b>branch</b> <b>root</b> formation, were similar to other hormone-regulated developmental systems. Anatomical and cytological studies were made of segments exposed for various times to auxin. The segments were mostly diarch, and branches formed obliquely to protoxylem poles. While primarily only pericycle-endodermis cells divided, both these and cortex cells responded in the first 24 hours exposure to naphthaleneacetic acid with enlarged nuclei and nucleoli, and a few cortical cells divided. Maximum nucleus and nucleolus size was reached approximately 9 hours after exposure to naphthaleneacetic acid. Branches rarely elongated more than 5 cm before their meristems died. The H. ravenii culture is maintained only by the frequent formation of new naphthaleneacetic acid-induced branches...|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to Fe-deficiency, various dicots increase their <b>root</b> <b>branching</b> which {{contributes to the}} enhancement of ferric-chelate reductase activity. Whether this Fe-deficiency-induced response eventually enhances {{the ability of the}} plant to tolerate Fe-deficiency or not is still unclear and evidence is also scarce about the signals triggering it. In this study, {{it was found that the}} SPAD-chlorophyll meter values of newly developed leaves of four tomato (Solanum lycocarpum) lines, namely line 227 / 1 and Roza and their two reciprocal F 1 hybrid lines, were positively correlated with their <b>root</b> <b>branching</b> under Fe-deficient conditions. It indicates that Fe-deficiency-induced <b>root</b> <b>branching</b> is critical for plant tolerance to Fe-deficiency. In another tomato line, Micro-Tom, the increased <b>root</b> <b>branching</b> in Fe-deficient plants was accompanied by the elevation of endogenous auxin and nitric oxide (NO) levels, and was suppressed either by the auxin transport inhibitors NPA and TIBA or the NO scavenger cPTIO. On the other hand, <b>root</b> <b>branching</b> in Fe-sufficient plants was induced either by the auxin analogues NAA and 2, 4 -D or the NO donors NONOate or SNP. Further, in Fe-deficient plants, NONOate restored the NPA-terminated <b>root</b> <b>branching,</b> but NAA did not affect the cPTIO-terminated <b>root</b> <b>branching.</b> Fe-deficiency-induced <b>root</b> <b>branching</b> was inhibited by the NO-synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NAME, but was not affected by the nitrate reductase (NR) inhibitor NH 4 +, tungstate or glycine. Taking all of these findings together, a novel function and signalling pathway of Fe-deficiency-induced <b>root</b> <b>branching</b> is presented where NOS-generated rather than NR-generated NO acts downstream of auxin in regulating this Fe-deficiency-induced response, which enhances the plant tolerance to Fe-deficiency...|$|R
