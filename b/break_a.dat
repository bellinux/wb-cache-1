5|$|The Fasci {{movement}} {{was made up}} of a federation of scores of associations that developed among farm workers, tenant farmers, and small sharecroppers as well as artisans, intellectuals, and industrial workers. The immediate demands of the movement were fair land rents, higher wages, lower local taxes and distribution of misappropriated common land. Between 1889 and 1893 some 170 Fasci were established in Sicily. According to some sources the movement reached a membership of more than 300,000 by the end of 1893. The Fasci constituted autonomous organizations with their own insignia (red rosettes), uniforms and sometimes even musical bands, and their own local halls for reunions and congresses. They were called Fasci (Fascio literally means bundle) because everyone can <b>break</b> <b>a</b> single stick, but no one can <b>break</b> <b>a</b> bundle of sticks.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe began {{competition}} in 2002 at the Australian Championships in Brisbane in March, which {{were used to}} select the team for the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester and the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships. After his record six gold medals in Fukuoka, the meet was surrounded by further expectations of world records and speculation that he would match Spitz's seven gold medals. His winning time in the 400m was the second fastest in history, but such was the expectation on him that his failure to <b>break</b> <b>a</b> world record was the talking point. He claimed the 100m and 200m events in times outside his best, making {{it the first time}} that he had failed to <b>break</b> <b>a</b> world record at a major meet since 1999. He also experimented by adding the 100m backstroke to his repertoire, placing second. This earned him a Commonwealth spot in a seventh event, leading to further media speculation that he could match Spitz.|$|E
5|$|A {{vote was}} held on 3 May 1965 in which the {{committee}} voted to strike against Coachella Valley grape growers. Although the strikers weren't able to negotiate {{a contract with the}} growers, they did succeed in winning higher wages. Following the success in Southern California, on 8 September 1965 the Agriculture Workers Organizing Committee voted to strike against grape growers in Delano, California, where the grape season starts in September. This strike became the first time Mexican workers, due to the decision of Cesar Chavez, did not <b>break</b> <b>a</b> strike of Filipinos; later, on 16 September 1965, Chavez's National Farm Workers Association joined the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee on the picket lines. These strikes occurred around the same time when younger Filipino Americans began a period of political self-reflection and awakening.|$|E

Outside, Boyd was in an agitated state from the drug and threatened to <b>break</b> <b>a</b> store window, but Harrison pulled her away. Later, when Boyd and her group were in a lift on their way up to the Ad Lib club, they mistakenly believed it was on fire.|$|E

Heavy smoke was {{building}} up in the stairwells and a captain and two firefighters from Engine 11 were assigned {{to go to the}} top level to ventilate the stairwell. The three firefighters went up a center staircase from the 22nd floor and soon radioed that they were disoriented by heavy smoke on the 30th floor. There were attempts to direct the firefighters through the radio, and soon after the captain requested permission to <b>break</b> <b>a</b> window for ventilation, which was followed by a message that the captain was down. Permission to break the window was given and a search and rescue effort was initiated.|$|E
5|$|Hambleton {{assigned}} {{himself as}} navigator on the older EB-66C, which was configured to gather signals intelligence. The newer EB-66E was tasked with jamming surface-to-air missile (SAM) radar guidance systems so their missiles could not accurately target the aircraft. The EB-66's {{mission was to}} troll for missiles, let them lock on to their aircraft, and then execute a SAM <b>break,</b> <b>a</b> violent turn and dive designed to throw off the pursuing missile. The SA-2 {{was the size of}} a telephone pole and carried a proximity fused warhead that was lethal within about , but their guidance systems failed at about 2 Gs, while the EB-66 could achieve 5 Gs in its avoidance maneuver. The crew had successfully pulled a SAM break more than 100 times. The presence of North Vietnamese surface-to-air missiles south of the DMZ had been tracked by Hambleton, but not everyone agreed they were present that far south.|$|E

In Newport News, lightning set a roof on fire in the Lee Hall section of the city. Emily's light rains in the area were not enough to <b>break</b> <b>a</b> prolonged drought that plagued Virginia.

After Jimbo and Kearney move their hands just before the record is claimed, the pyramid collapses into a giant sphere that rolls through town, taking in Agnes Skinner, Hans Moleman, and a suicidal man about to jump from a ledge onto the street. The entire town rolls to a truck weighing station and the Duff record book officials say that Springfield is the world's fattest town, ahead of Milwaukee.|$|E

Similarly, Steve Garvey played in his 163rd game of the season, leading the league with a figure which {{could not have been}} equaled by anyone not on the Astros or Dodgers. Dusty Baker won a Silver Slugger Award and Steve Howe, who pitched the final two scoreless innings of the tie-breaker for the Dodgers in relief, won the Rookie of the Year Award for their performances in the regular season. Additionally six Dodgers (Garvey, Davey Lopes, Bill Russell, Reggie Smith, Jerry Reuss, and Bob Welch) and two Astros (J. R. Richard and Cruz) were named to the National League's All-Star team.|$|E
