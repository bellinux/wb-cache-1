40|$|The superframing {{option of}} the recent DVB-S 2 X {{standard}} specifies, for the so-called SF-Pilot fields, {{the use of the}} orthogonal set of Walsh-Hadamard (WH) sequences. In order to exploit this orthogonality, waveforms coming from different beams to the k-th User Terminal (UT) should be quasi perfectly aligned in time. While in the downlink part of a terrestrial system this is quite straightforward, in satellite system, having a satellite as a relay, this is not the case, especially when large <b>baudrates</b> are considered in the transmission. A procedure to compensate for timing misalignment amongst waveforms is here presented and the advantages are quantified through numerical simulations. In particular, Channel State Information (CSI) estimation errors, which are fundamental for precoding techniques, are evaluated. While the focus of the work is on systems which enable precoding techniques, the procedure can be applied in each scenario which uses the superframing structure of DVB-S 2 X in an interference limited scenario...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we show that, in hybrid {{wavelength}} division multiplexed systems, {{the performance of}} high datatrate QPSK channels impaired by cross-phase modulation (XPM) induced by the lower rate OOK channels can be simply estimated by an extension of a well-known linear model for XPM, and novel analytical expressions of the sensitivity penalty are provided. From such a model we prove that the reported QPSK penalty decrease with QPSK <b>baudrate</b> increase should {{be attributed to the}} action of the phase estimation process rather than to the walkoff effect. The model also simply shows how coherent QPSK is more affected by XPM than incoherent DQPSK, and allows to infer that even more impact is expected when the <b>baudrate</b> is further reduced through polarization multiplexing.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) {{approach}} to implement a preliminary architecture for force-feedback control in steer-by-wire (SBW) applications. A brushless DC motor (BLDC) is used as force feedback actuator. The determination of the position of the BLDC rotor {{plays a key role in}} the control algorithm. To obtain a reliable rotor position a classic triple static redundancy (TMR) is implemented. The position signals from the encoder integrated on the motor are computed in three different ways: using a 8 -bit microcontroller, a 16 -bit microcontroller, and, last, using the software module integrated in a virtual hardware development tool. The virtual hardware platform operates as voter, too. The position is the output of the voting algorithm and it is sent to the 16 -bit platform that controls the motor and provides the correct output PWM signals. The communication between virtual hardware and real hardware uses CAN bus. The bus is monitored by a dedicated development tool. Steer-by-wire is a safety critical application and therefore requires time-triggered protocols. In this preliminary architecture a dedicated network has been implemented and therefore the disadvantages of the event-triggered protocol are considerably reduced. Experiments at different <b>baudrates</b> confirm that the voting algorithm produces correct results also in case of failure in one of the modules of the TMR architecture and it is not conditioned by bus loads. This means that the torque control algorithm of the BLDC motor can generate on the steering wheel (directly connected to the motor) a drive feeling like the one produced by a traditional steering system also in this fail-mode...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{articulated}} around {{the theme of}} ultra-wide bandwidth single channel signals. It focuses on the two main topics of transmission and processing of information by techniques compatible with high <b>baudrates.</b> The processing schemes introduced combine new linear and nonlinear optical platforms such as Fourier-domain programmable optical processors and chalcogenide chip waveguides, {{as well as the}} concept of neural network. Transmission of data is considered in the context of medium distance links of Optical Time Division Multiplexed (OTDM) data subject to environmental fluctuations. We experimentally demonstrate simultaneous compensation of differential group delay and multiple orders of dispersion at symbol rates of 640 Gbaud and 1. 28 Tbaud. Signal processing at high bandwidth is envisaged both in the case of elementary post-transmission analog error mitigation and in the broader field of optical computing for high level operations (“optical processor”). A key innovation is the introduction of a novel four-wave mixing scheme implementing a dot-product operation between wavelength multiplexed channels. In particular, it is demonstrated for low-latency hash-key based all-optical error detection in links encoded with advanced modulation formats. Finally, the work presents groundbreaking concepts for compact implementation of an optical neural network as a programmable multi-purpose processor. The experimental architecture can implement neural networks with several nodes on a single optical nonlinear transfer function implementing functions such as analog-to-digital conversion. The particularity of the thesis is the new approaches to optical signal processing that potentially enable high level operations using simple optical hardware and limited cascading of components...|$|R

40|$|Nyquist Wavelength {{division}} multiplexing (N-WDM), is {{a promising}} scheme {{in order to}} enhance the spectral efficiency of future coherent optical communication systems. In N-WDM systems, the channel bandwidth and spacing are selected to maximize the spectral efficiency while maintaining acceptable levels of inter-carrier and inter symbol interference. To further increase the spectral efficiency, bandwidth constrained N-WDM, where <b>baudrate</b> is higher than channel bandwidth can be considered. We propose to combine the bandwidth-constrained N-WDM scheme with a decision feedback equalizer (DFE) designed according to the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. We show that the enhanced resilience to the inter symbol interference offered by DFE provides an effective gain on spectral efficiency. We compare system benefits of DFE and maximum a posteriori sequence detection (MAP) for coherent optical receivers, and show that DFE is as efficient as MAP in mitigating inter symbol interference at a considerably lower complexity. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|With the {{continuously}} {{increasing demand}} of cost effective, broadband wireless access, radio-over-fiber (RoF) starts {{to gain more}} and more momentum. Various techniques already exist, using analog (ARoF) or digitized (DRoF) radio signals over fiber; each with their own advantages and disadvantages. By transmitting a sigma delta modulated signal over fiber (SDoF), a similar immunity to impairments as DRoF can be obtained while maintaining the low complexity of ARoF. This letter describes a detailed experimental comparison between ARoF and SDoF that quantifies the improvement in linearity and error vector magnitude (EVM) of SDoF over ARoF. The experiments were carried out using a 16 -QAM constellation with a <b>baudrate</b> from 20 to 125 MBd modulated on a central carrier frequency of 1 GHz. The sigma delta modulator runs at 8 or 13. 5 Gbps. A highspeed vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) operating at 850 nm is used to transmit the signal over 200 -m multimode fiber. The receiver amplifies the electrical signals and subsequently filters to recover the original RF signal. Compared with ARoF, improvements exceeding 40 dB were measured on the third order intermodulation products when SDoF was employed, the EVM improves between 2. 4 and 7. 1 dB...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{automatic}} detection of the modulation {{type of communication}} signals in the HF range between 2 and 30 MHz is extremely difficult due to the signal distortion caused by sky wave propagation. Under time varying and frequency selective fading it’s difficult to determine between stationary digital and nonstationary speech modulated transmissions. In this paper an algorithm is introduced to seperate speech modulated single side-band (SSB) and double sideband (AM) broadcasts from all other broadcasts in the HF range. The algorithm extracts a set of fea-tures from the analyzed signal and uses a polynomial classifier to classify the signal. I. REQUIREMENTS In the HF range {{it is possible that}} different signals overlap in the receiver. So one requirement for the algorithm is that some kind of segmentation (i. e. a radio direction finder) adjusts the frequency range of the receiver to the frequency range of the analyzed signals. The signal length of the analyzed signal should normally be as short as possible. For the introduced algorithm a dwell time of at least 500 ms is required. II. ASSUMPTIONS The only information about the received signal are its esti-mated bandwidth and center frequency. All other information about the signal like exact carrier frequency as well as modu-lation parameters like <b>baudrate,</b> frequency shift or pulse shape used at the transmitter are assumed to be unknown. The algo-rithm should seperate SSB and AM broadcast from all other broadcasts typically found in the HF range, i. e. FSK (usually 2 and 4 FSK), PSK (usually 2, 4 and 8 PSK), MSK, ASK, VFT and unmodulated carriers. Its assumed that the received signal is disturbed due to time varying and frequency selective fad-ing. The fading makes it difficult to decide between stationary digital and nonstationary speech modulated signals. III. NORMALIZATION AND PREPROCESSING Input signal for the algorithm is the complex valued base-band signal r(t) with unknown frequency shift...|$|E
