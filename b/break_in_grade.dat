40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of treatment fidelity, both quantitative (training time and lesson/program completion) and qualitative (level matching procedures, tutor support, and children's task orientation) {{on the outcome of}} an individualized computer-supported reading intervention provided by non-professional tutors (i. e., parents and volunteers). Thirty two children at risk of reading failure (14 Dutch schools) and their tutor participated <b>in</b> Kindergarten and <b>Grade</b> 1. Results indicated that 87 % of the tutors were able to provide sufficient to high levels of support, 70 % used adequate level matching procedures, and average quantitative treatment fidelity was 67 %. Nearly all children showed sufficient to very high task orientation during the lessons. Stepwise regression analyses showed that quantitative treatment fidelity and child task orientation predicted reading outcomes in Kindergarten, after the summer <b>break,</b> and <b>in</b> <b>Grade</b> 1.

40|$|I {{examine the}} time series {{variation}} in corporate credit rating {{standards for the}} period 1985 - 2007. I report two main findings: (i) There is a divergent pattern between investment grade and speculative grade rating standards during 1985 - 2002. Investment grade ratings tighten between 1985 and 2002. In contrast, the speculative grade rating standards loosen during the same period. (ii) There is a sharp structural <b>break</b> <b>in</b> both investment <b>grade</b> and speculative grade standards towards more stringent ratings around 2002. The change in rating levels due to the structural break is both economically and statistically significant. Holding firm characteristics constant, firms experience a drop of 1. 5 notches in ratings due to tightening standards between 2002 and 2007. The loosening <b>in</b> speculative <b>grade</b> ratings before 2002 is consistent with widespread criticism of the rating agencies during the Dot-Com crash {{and appears to be}} driven by revenue maximization concerns of rating agencies. On the other hand, the 2002 structural break is consistent with rating agencies responding to intense scrutiny. It appears that reputational concerns and threat of regulation led rating agencies to move towards more conservative ratings after the Enron debacle and passage of Sarbanes-Oxley Act...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of {{curricula}} {{for primary}} and secondary education in Slovenia shows that there are gaps in the continuity of learning of topics related to astronomy. The fact that the astronomical contents do not upgrade every year {{and that there is}} a 4 -year gap might lead to some misconceptions. Among 58 first year pre-service primary school students of the Faculty of Education, University of Ljubljana, we carried out a research about students' knowledge and conceptions about the Solar system as a part of a written exam at the end of the spring semester. Results show that students, despite learning of topics through educational vertical, have difficulties with presenting the positions of celestial bodies, in identifying the Moon's phases and eclipses regarding to the positions of objects. This shows the need for an early introduction of the topic and its gradual upgrading and consolidation of knowledge. All this is not predicted by the curriculum, but some other options exist. One efficient option might be a didactic game, which is available to pupils during school hours; extended stay or <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> those <b>grades</b> that do not have astronomical topics in the curriculum. In the contribution the results of the conducted research on the knowledge deficit presenting the basis for an independent design and production of didactic games about the solar system, the position of celestial bodies, the Moon's phases and eclipses will be presented The designed didactic games will be briefly presented in the contribution as wel...|$|R
