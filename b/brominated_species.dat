In Wyoming, where air quality is normally quite good, has seen extremely high levels of ozone since the gas extraction has begun. In other areas such as Pennsylvania there have been concerns of shale drilling and the contamination of private drinking water wells. Many research studies have focused on methane migration in shallow ground water wells. Additionally, in western Pennsylvania there has been an association with shale gas waste-water and elevated levels of bromide in rivers which is a major resource for drinking water. Bromide itself is not harmful and had not been tracked or regulated in Pennsylvania and therefore there are no historical records to reference. Bromide is a significant public health risk because bromide reacts with chlorinated organics to form disinfection by-products called trihalomethanes (THMs) in chlorinated drinking water. Local water quality experts observed higher than normal levels of <b>brominated</b> <b>species</b> of THMs since unconventional drilling in the Marcellus shale began in the region. <b>Brominated</b> <b>species</b> of disinfection by-products have been described by toxicologists as probable carcinogens and are more toxic then the chlorinated species.

40|$|Peroxidative {{bromination}} of {{phenol red}} to its tetrabromo derivative, bromophenol blue, required vanadate {{in addition to}} H 2 O 2 when {{carried out in the}} pH range of 5 - 7. Excess H 2 O 2, with ratio of H 2 O 2 :vanadate of 2 : 1 and above, prevented the reaction. Diperoxovanadate, known to be formed in such reaction mixtures, was ineffective by itself and needed uncomplexed vanadate (V-v) or vanadyl (V-iv) to support bromination. Bromide-assisted reduction of the excess vanadate to vanadyl appeared to be an essential secondary reaction. In the absence of phenol red oxygen was released, and concomitantly bromide was oxidized to a form competent to brominate phenol red added after termination of oxygen release. These findings indicated participation of reactions leading to an intermediate derived from vanadyl and diperoxovanadate, previously described from this laboratory (Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 316, 319 - 326, 1995). Continuous bromination of phenol red occurred when glucose oxidase-glucose system was used as a source of continuous flow of H 2 O 2. A scheme of reactions involving peroxovanadates (mono-, di-, mu-, and bromo-) is proposed for the formation and utilization of an active <b>brominating</b> <b>species</b> and for the recycling of the product, mono-peroxovanadate, by H 2 O 2, which explains the catalytic role of vanadium in the bromoperoxidation reaction...|$|R

We now demonstrate that eosinophil activation in vivo results in oxidative damage of proteins through bromination of tyrosine residues, a heretofore unrecognized pathway for covalent modification of biologic targets in human tissues. Mass spectrometric studies demonstrated that 3 -bromotyrosine serves as a specific “molecular fingerprint” for proteins modified through the eosinophil peroxidase-H 2 O 2 system in the presence of plasma levels of halides. We applied a localized allergen challenge to model the effects of eosinophils and brominating oxidants in human lung injury. Endobronchial biopsy specimens from allergen-challenged lung segments of asthmatic, but not healthy control, subjects demonstrated significant enrichments in eosinophils and eosinophil peroxidase. Baseline levels of 3 -bromotyrosine in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) proteins from mildly allergic asthmatic individuals were modestly but not statistically significantly elevated over those in control subjects. After exposure to segmental allergen challenge, lung segments of asthmatics, but not healthy control subjects, exhibited a > 10 -fold increase in BAL 3 -bromotyrosine content, but only two- to threefold increases in 3 -chlorotyrosine, a specific oxidation product formed by neutrophil- and monocyte-derived myeloperoxidase.

Estimates of previously published carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks through oral exposure to THMs were re-evaluated using a probabilistic approach that took the seasonal concentration {{variation in}}to account. Chloroform, bromoform, dibromochloromethane and dichloroacetonitrile were the most frequently detected compounds. Among these, chloroform was detected with the highest concentrations ranging from 0. 03 to 98. 4 μg/L. In tap water, at the groundwater supplied sampling point, <b>brominated</b> <b>species,</b> bromoform and dibromoacetonitrile, were detected {{at the highest levels}} most probably due to bromide ion intrusion from seawater.

Due to widespread use of chlorine and the reluctance of drinking water providers to overhaul current treatment systems, research has been undertaken to investigate post-treatment removal of THMs. One such method is spray aeration, whereby water is recycled in water storage tanks by spraying it through showerheads. Using a spray aeration model and a simple sensitivity analysis, the following study evaluates the influence of various parameters on the model’s output.

Samples were collected seasonally from the water treatment plants and at different locations in the distribution systems. The highest HAA concentrations occurred in the upland surface water system, with an average total HAA concentration of 21. 3 μg/L. The lowest HAA levels were observed in the groundwater source, with a mean concentration of 0. 6 μg/L. Seasonal variations were significant in the HAA concentrations; the highest total HAA concentrations were found during the autumn, when the concentrations were approximately two times higher than in winter and spring.

It is the first survey of its type to compare bromine substitution factors (BSFs) between the haloacetamides and haloacetonitriles. Concentrations of the dihalogenated haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides were well correlated. Although median concentrations of these two groups were lower in chloraminated than chlorinated surface waters, median BSFs for both in chloraminated samples were approximately double those in chlorinated samples, which is significant because of the higher reported toxicity of the <b>brominated</b> <b>species.</b> Furthermore, median BSFs were moderately higher for the dihalogenated haloacetamides than for the haloacetonitriles. This indicates that, while the dihalogenated haloacetamides were primarily generated from hydrolysis of the corresponding haloacetonitriles, secondary formation pathways also contributed. Median halonitromethane concentrations were remarkably unchanging for {{the different types of}} disinfectants and source waters: 0. 1 μg·mgTOC− 1 in all cases.

In particular, addition reactions of halogen atoms with alkenes will result in forming halogenated organic intermediates, whose photochemical loss rates are carefully evaluated in the present work. Model calculations with the new chemical scheme reveal that the oceanic emissions of acetaldehyde (CH 3 CHO) and alkenes (especially C 3 H 6) are important factors for regulating reactive halogen chemistry in the MBL by promoting the conversion of Br atoms into HBr or more stable brominated intermediates in the organic form. The latter include brominated hydroperoxides, bromoacetaldehyde, and bromoacetone, which sequester bromine from a reactive inorganic pool. The total mixing ratio of <b>brominated</b> organic <b>species</b> thus produced is likely to reach 10 - 20 % or more of that of inorganic gaseous bromine species over wide regions over the ocean. The reaction between Br atoms and C 2 H 2 is shown to be unimportant for determining the degree of bromine activation in the remote MBL. These results imply that reactive halogen chemistry can mediate a link between the oceanic emissions of VOCs and the behaviors of compounds that are sensitive to halogen chemistry such as dimethyl sulfide, NO x, and O 3 in the MBL...|$|R
40|$|A box model {{incorporating}} a state-of-the-art chemical mechanism for atmospheric mercury (Hg) cycling {{was developed to}} investigate the oxidation of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) at three locations in the northeastern United States: Appledore Island (AI; marine), Thompson Farm (TF; coastal, rural), and Pack Monadnock (PM; inland, rural, elevated). The chemical mechanism in this box model included the most up-to-date Hg and halogen chemistry. As a result, the box model was able to simulate reasonably the observed diurnal cycles of gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM) and chemical speciation bearing distinct differences between the three sites. In agreement with observations, simulated GOM diurnal cycles at AI and TF showed significant daytime peaks {{in the afternoon and}} nighttime minimums compared to flat GOM diurnal cycles at PM. Moreover, significant differences in the magnitude of GOM diurnal amplitude (AI > TF > PM) were captured in modeled results. At the coastal and inland sites, GEM oxidation was predominated by O 3 and OH, contributing 80 – 99  % of total GOM production during daytime. H 2 O 2 -initiated GEM oxidation was significant (∼  33  % of the total GOM) at the inland site during nighttime. In the marine boundary layer (MBL) atmosphere, Br and BrO became dominant GEM oxidants, with mixing ratios reaching 0. 1 and 1  pptv, respectively, and contributing ∼  70  % of the total GOM production during midday, while O 3 dominated GEM oxidation (50 – 90  % of GOM production) over the remaining day when Br and BrO mixing ratios were diminished. The majority of HgBr produced from GEM+Br was oxidized by NO 2 and HO 2 to form <b>brominated</b> GOM <b>species.</b> Relative humidity and products of the CH 3 O 2 +BrO reaction possibly significantly affected the mixing ratios of Br or BrO radicals and subsequently GOM formation. Gas–particle partitioning could potentially be important in the production of GOM as well as Br and BrO at the marine site...|$|R
40|$|Chlorination is {{most widely}} used {{disinfection}} method in water and wastewater treatment. This process has demonstrated its effectiveness in protecting the public health. However, chlorine reacts with natural organic matter (NOM) to form disinfection by-products (DBPs). Trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) are the most prevalent compounds. Many studies have conducted to investigate the factors such as chlorine dosages, characteristics of NOM, bromide ion concentration {{in the formation of}} these DBPs, but there are few investigations on the influence of organic nitrogen compounds. Besides, DBP formation in chlorination of wastewater is unclear but of concern in recent years. In this study, breakpoint chlorination of wastewater effluents from different sources was conducted to study the formation of DBPs including THMs and HAAs in wastewater chlorination. Synthetic solutions containing ammonia, humic acid, organic-N compounds, and bromide were chlorinated under different experimental conditions to study the effect of organic-N compounds on the formation of DBPs. Glycine was chosen as the primary model organic-N compound and effects of other model organic-N compounds were also evaluated for comparison. Samples were periodically withdrawn and subjected to analyses for evaluating chlorine residuals and the formation of THMs, HAAs and cyanogen halides (CNXs). Results of the study showed large variations in the patterns of THMs and HAAs from breakpoint chlorination of different wastewater effluents. However, the formation of THMs and HAAs increased sharply at chlorine dosages above the breakpoint. In chlorination of synthetic solutions, the formation of THMs and HAAs were found to decrease with increasing glycine and ammonia concentrations, but increase with increasing bromide ion concentration. CNXs formation was found to be highly sensitive to free-chlorine-to-glycine ratio and its formation trend was significantly affected by the presence/absence of ammonia. The incorporation of bromine changed the by-product speciation towards the <b>brominated</b> <b>species</b> and enhanced the yields of total THMs, HAAs and CNXs. Different model organic-N compounds exerted different effects on the formation of THMs, HAAs, and CNXs. The variations are likely attributable to the reactivity and the structure of the organic-N compounds...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the synthesis of}} a new geodesic polyarene molecule based on corannulene’s motive and especially designed for hydrogen storage. Indeed such curved systems are bearing a dipole moment which can polarize H 2 molecules resulting in their adsorption. The complexation of our target molecules with alkali ions would increase their dipole moment {{as well as the}} interstitial volume between the molecular stacks thus increasing the hydrogen storage capabilities. In the first part, DFT calculations were undertaken to compare our target molecule with other curved systems and to point out the advantages or inconvenients for hydrogen storage applications. Two main synthetic pathways were postulated, the first one starting from 2, 6 -difluoroacetic acid and the other starting from 2, 6 -dichlorophenylacetic acid. In the first it was planned that the cyclized target molecule would be obtained by fluorhydric acid elimination which was a recently discovered means of curvature introduction; the second would result of flash vacuum pyrolysis or palladium catalyzed reaction which are already well known for such purposes. Unfortunately problems were encountered at the first step in each pathway, namely during the bisbenzyl ketone synthesis. The Dakin-West reaction was initially explored, but it proved to be inefficient and because its mechanism was not well understood, computational calculations supported by ESI-MS measurements were undertaken. Bisbenzyl anhydride was identified as intermediate, thus it was tested as a starting reagent treated with 4 -dimethylaminopyridine but without success except when starting from unsubstituted 2 -phenylacetic anhydride. For each pathway Claisen condensation was tested and offered the desired bisbenzyl ketone from the corresponding ester, but only in poor yields. A third approach in which 2 -(2, 6 -dichlorophenyl) acetyl chloride was reacted with a Grignard reagent formed from 2 -(bromomethyl) - 1, 3 -dichlorobenzene and magnesium was tested. Unfortunately Wurtz coupling between <b>brominated</b> <b>species</b> was mainly observed thus hindering the production of bisbenzyl ketone as major product...|$|E
40|$|Disinfection {{by-products}} (DBPs) {{in drinking}} water are formed when natural organic matter (NOM) that remains after initial treatment reacts with disinfectants, such as chlorine or chloramines. DBPs, which are of health concern, can {{take the form of}} trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), haloacetonitriles (HANs), haloketones (HKs), haloacetaldehydes (HAs), halonitromethanes (HNMs) {{and a host of other}} halogenated DBPs. So far, regulations in the United Kingdom (UK) only encompass the group of THMs allowing a maximum level of 100 µg/L. HAAs, the second most prevalent class of DBPs, are currently under consideration by the European Union to be regulated at 80 µg/L. Reliable and reproducible quantification methods are required for DBP detection. To address this need, the presented work includes a comparative study between analytical devices, which concludes that GC/ECD is the only approach with suitable detection limits. This work reports an investigation of the DBP formation potential (FP) of waters from 11 water treatment works (WTWs) at different locations in the UK. Several of these waters have shown to form significant levels of HAAs and THMs. Furthermore, other DBPs, such as iodo-THMs (i-THMs), HANs, HKs, HAs and HNMs were detected. It has also been confirmed that improving the control of these DBPs can be achieved by using monochloramine instead of free chlorine. A statistical analysis revealed that THMs correlated well with the HAAs, and as a result the regulatory limit of 100 µg/L for the THM 4 would fail a regulation of 80 µg/L for the nine HAAs. A number of parameters have been identified, which have particular relevance when considering the formation of HAAs and THMs in treated waters. Threshold bromide level was determined beyond which speciation of DBPs shift toward <b>brominated</b> <b>species.</b> The pH, which significantly affected THMs, was less strongly linked to the HAAs. The temperature had a consistent impact with a decreasing DBP formation at lower temperatures. Increasing the contact time with the disinfectant resulted in parallel first order reaction kinetics of the HAAs and THMs. Finally, the precursors involved in the formation of DBPs were found to be specific to water sources...|$|E

40|$|Disinfection {{byproducts}} (DBPs) {{are formed}} in water treatment and in distribution systems when disinfectants, most commonly chlorine, react with organic matter and inorganic precursors, e. g. bromide. Reducing exposure to DBPs remains {{a concern for}} the national drinking water utility community, as some of them are of health concern. Currently, two class sums of DBPs, total trihalomethanes (TTHM) and five haloacetic acids (HAA 5) are regulated under the Stage 2 D/DBP Rule. Changes in climate, as well as anthropogenic activities, can lead to increased DBP precursors, specifically total organic carbon (TOC) and bromide, which could force water utilities to make important and expensive decisions regarding treatment processes. Additionally, increased bromide can increase the formation of brominated DBPs, which are of greater health concern than their fully chlorinated counterparts. The impact of climate on source water quality, particularly TOC and bromide concentration, and subsequent impact on a water treatment plant’s capacity to meet DBP regulations was evaluated at three sites. Source water TOC concentration was modeled with climate, temperature and precipitation, and land surface, soil moisture and vegetation, predictors using a local polynomial regression. A methodology was developed for determining site-specific source water TOC and bromide thresholds for Stage 2 D/DBP compliance. Thresholds were determined for the three sites; TOC thresholds varied monthly from 1. 6 - 2. 6 mg/L, 2. 2 - 3. 2 mg/L, and 2. 2 - 4. 2 mg/L and bromide thresholds for one site ranged from National occurrence of brominated DBP formation was assessed through analyzing trends for all nine haloacetic acids that include four unregulated haloacetic acids and for bromine incorporation factors (BIFs), along with spatial analysis for BIFs. Changes in HAA 9 and in HAA 5 occurrence before and after the D/DBP Rule implementation were compared to assess how regulatory changes have impacted unregulated <b>brominated</b> HAA <b>species.</b> For one case study location, BIFs were modeled using local polynomial regression with climate, temperature, and water quality covariates, the bromide-to-TOC ratio and UV 254 absorbance...|$|R

It has been shown that, regardless of the source, trichloromethane (TCM) comprised approximately 20 percent of the TOX. While there is controversy of the THMs as percentage of TOX, in an extensive study, effects of 3 pH values, 3 reaction times and 4 bromide concentrations on the formation of 4 THMs, trichloromethane (TCM), dicholorobromomethane (DCBM), dibromochloromethane (DBCM) and tribromomethane (TBM) as percentage of TOX have been evaluated. Factorial designs were used to statistically evaluate influences of different factors. Honesty Significant Differences test (HSD) and ANOVA tests {{were used for the}} statistical analyses. The Excel graphic software was used for plotting the formation curves, and Lotus 1, 2, 3 was used for the calculations. Statistical analyses showed that the parameters Br, pH and reaction time had significant effects on the formation of TOX and individual THMs. The study revealed that although TCM was the principal percentage of the TOX as THMs in the absence of bromide ion, this compound decreased rapidly with the incremental addition of Br.
