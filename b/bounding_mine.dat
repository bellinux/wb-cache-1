500|$|Land mines {{were first}} {{used by the}} JNA in early 1991, before its {{withdrawal}} from Croatia, to protect military barracks and other facilities. Even JNA facilities located in urban centres were secured in this way, using mines such as the PROM-1 <b>bounding</b> <b>mine</b> and MRUD directional anti-personnel mine. The Croatian Army (HV) and Croatian police began laying land mines in late 1991, relying heavily on them to stop advances by the JNA and the Army of the RSK (ARSK) until early 1992. These early minefields were laid with little documentation. In 1992 the ARSK increased its use of mines to secure the front line, largely due to its limited number of troops. Consequently, the ARSK constructed static defensive lines (consisting of trenches, bunkers and large numbers of mines designed to protect thinly-manned defences) to delay HV offensives. This approach was necessitated by the limited depth of RSK territory {{and the lack of}} reserves available with which to counterattack (or block) breaches of its defensive line, which meant that the ARSK was unable to employ defence in depth tactics. [...] The combination of poor documentation of minefield locations and the lack of markings (or fencing) led to frequent injuries to military personnel caused by mines laid by friendly forces. It is estimated that a total of 1.5million land mines were laid during the war.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bounding</b> <b>mines</b> {{have a small}} lifting charge that, when activated, {{launches}} {{the main}} body of the mine out of the ground before it detonates at around chest height. This produces a more lethal spray of shrapnel over a larger area. One such—the US M16 mine—can cause injuries up to 200 m away. The steel shrapnel makes <b>bounding</b> <b>mines</b> easy to detect, so they may be surrounded by Minimum metal mines to make mine clearance harder.|$|R

50|$|<b>Bounding</b> <b>mines</b> {{are more}} {{expensive}} than typical AP blast mines, {{and they do not}} lend themselves to scatterable designs. Because they are designed to be buried, they are appropriate for command-detonated ambushes, but tripwire operation is common as well. By design, <b>bounding</b> <b>mines</b> contain a large amount of steel, which makes them comparatively easy to detect with metal detectors. However, it is often the case that minimum metal mines have also been planted in the same minefield, which complicates the demining process.|$|R

The plans escaped to the US via Major Pierre Delalande, a member of the French Corps of Engineers, and were used as the basis for the American M2 <b>bounding</b> <b>mine</b> which saw wider service during the war but was considered largely ineffective. The M2 mine was replaced almost immediately afterwards with the M16 <b>bounding</b> <b>mine,</b> an almost exact copy of the German S-mine.

The mine has a waterproof plastic faceted cylindrical body with a three-pronged cap, with a central fixing point for a tripwire.

Other countries that have employed <b>bounding</b> <b>mines</b> in war include the United States of America, the Soviet Union, Vietnam and countries of former Yugoslavia. China and Italy have also produced them. Some American mines designed for this purpose used a standard 60 mm HE mortar round with an improvised time delay fuse which is activated by the propelling charge.|$|R
50|$|A <b>bounding</b> <b>mine</b> is an {{anti-personnel mine}} {{designed}} {{to be used in}} open areas. When tripped, a small propelling charge launches the body of the mine 3-4 feet (0.9-1.2 metres) into the air, where the main charge detonates and sprays fragmentation at roughly waist height.|$|E
50|$|Anti-personnel mines are {{a form of}} mine {{designed}} for use against humans, as opposed to anti-tank mines, which are {{designed for}} use against vehicles.

50|$|The XM-54 was an {{experimental}} U.S. incendiary landmine tested during the Vietnam War. It {{was a large}} <b>bounding</b> <b>mine</b> that could either be command detonated or trip wire activated. It contained 15.3 lbs (6.9 kg) of plasticised white phosphorus. Approximately 200 were shipped to Vietnam in August 1968, and some were used operationally.|$|E
50|$|This mine has {{significant}} metal content, {{which makes it}} easy to find using a metal detector. However, like the majority of <b>bounding</b> <b>mines,</b> most of the Valmara 69 is hidden underground and may be difficult to see, particularly in heavy undergrowth. Additionally, the Valmara 69 may be laid along with minimum metal mines such as the VS-50, VS MK2, TS-50, SB-33 and SB-81, which complicates the clearance process.|$|R

5000|$|MS-3 - Has existed {{since at}} least 1973. It looks similar to the PMN-1, but has a small [...] "blister" [...] in {{the centre of the}} pressure-plate, {{incorporating}} a spring-loaded, pressure-release anti-handling device. The explosive content is 310 grams of TNT. The total weight of a MS-3 is 630 g. An MS-3 requires a minimum load of between 5 and 6 kg on the [...] "blister" [...] to prevent detonation. As a result, armed MS-3 mines will always be encountered under some sort of heavy object, such as beneath an OZM <b>bounding</b> <b>mine</b> or sometimes an anti-tank mine to act as an anti-handling device. Note that detonation of an MS-3 under an anti-tank mine may cause sympathetic detonation of the larger munition. Additionally, an MS-3 could simply be used as a conventional boobytrap device without being buried, for example deliberately planted inside a building or a vehicle with some form of weight on top such as a suitcase.|$|E

5000|$|When emplaced, most of an M16 mine {{is buried}} {{underground}} {{so it can}} be extremely difficult to spot them visually, particularly in areas of long grass, heavy undergrowth or other debris. The M16 contains large amounts of metal, so is very easy to detect using a mine detector. However, {{it is important to note}} that the act of moving the detection head over the ground may strike the prongs and trigger the mine. In any case, other minimum metal mines may have been planted near to an M16 in order to protect it from mine clearance personnel. Additionally, if long tripwires are fitted, the M16 may [...] "see" [...] the deminers before they have chance to find it. When tracking the path of tripwires fitted to any <b>bounding</b> <b>mine,</b> great care must be taken: it is quite possible that additional antipersonnel blast mines (e.g. the M14) may have been buried beneath its path. An extra complicating factor is that some M16 mines may have been fitted with an anti-handling device e.g. placing an M26 grenade underneath it with an M5 pressure-release boobytrap firing device screwed into it. Deliberately triggering the mines from cover, using some form of grappling hook attached to a long rope may be useful in some situations and provide an initial way into the minefield before further clearance work begins.|$|E

In 1872 open cut mining operations were begun at the Pinnacle when the main reef was discovered. The first shafts were sunk in the Homeward <b>Bound</b> <b>mine</b> in 1872 with payable gold found in 1874. In 1875, the first stamp battery (5 head) was erected.In 1880 a mail receiving station was opened and in 1884 a public school opened, it closed in 1918, reopened in 1924 and finally closed in 1928.|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{study has been}} conducted into the response of anti-personnel mines at the impact of an Explosively Formed Projectile (EFP). The objective was to obtain a low order reaction (preferably a deflagration) to minimise collateral damage. Further the method should be capable to neutralise mines, buried underneath 20 cm soil. An EFP design with a liner of 75 mm was downscaled (1 : 2 and 2 : 3). Impact experiments showed that small charge mines responded with a detonation, the larger <b>bounding</b> <b>mines</b> responded with either a deflagration or a detonation whereas the EFPs showed insufficient capacity to penetrate soil.

5000|$|The German S-mine (Schrapnellmine, Springmine or Splittermine in German), {{also known}} as the [...] "Bouncing Betty", is the best-known version of a class of <b>mines</b> known as <b>bounding</b> <b>mines.</b> When triggered, these mines launch into the air and then {{detonate}} at about 0.9 m. The explosion projects a lethal spray of shrapnel in all directions. The S-mine was an anti-personnel mine developed by Germany in the 1930s and used extensively by German forces during World War II. It was designed to be used in open areas against unshielded infantry. Two versions were produced, designated by the year of their first production: the SMi-35 and SMi-44. There are only minor differences between the two models.|$|R
