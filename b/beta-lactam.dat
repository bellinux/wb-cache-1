5|$|Enzyme {{production}} (transcription and {{translation of}} enzyme genes) {{can be enhanced}} or diminished by a cell in response {{to changes in the}} cell's environment. This form of gene regulation is called enzyme induction. For example, bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin because enzymes called beta-lactamases are induced that hydrolyse the crucial <b>beta-lactam</b> ring within the penicillin molecule. Another example comes from enzymes in the liver called cytochrome P450 oxidases, which are important in drug metabolism. Induction or inhibition of these enzymes can cause drug interactions. Enzyme levels can also be regulated by changing the rate of enzyme degradation.|$|E

Appropriate antibiotic selection, as well as adequate dosing, is important to improve the clinical outcome for these patients. <b>beta-Lactams</b> are the most common antibiotic class used in critically ill sepsis patients because of their broad spectrum of activity and high tolerability. <b>beta-Lactams</b> exhibit time-dependent antibacterial activity.

40|$|Peracetic acid (PAA) is a {{disinfection}} oxidant {{used in many}} industries including wastewater treatment. <b>beta-Lactams,</b> a {{group of}} widely prescribed antibiotics, are frequently detected in wastewater effluents and surface waters. The reaction kinetics and transformation of seven <b>beta-lactams</b> (cefalexin (CFX), cefadroxil (CFR), cefapirin (CFP), cephalothin (CFT), ampicillin (AMP), amoxicillin (AMX) and penicillin G (PG)) toward PM were investigated to elucidate the behavior of <b>beta-lactams</b> during PAA oxidation processes. The reaction follows second-order kinetics and is much faster at pH 5 and 7 than at pH 9 due to speciation of PM.

25|$|Resistance to <b>beta-lactam</b> {{antibiotics}} {{has become}} a particular problem in recent decades, as strains of bacteria that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases have become more common. These beta-lactamase enzymes make many, if not all, of the penicillins and cephalosporins ineffective as therapy. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase–producing E. coli (ESBL E. coli) are highly resistant to an array of antibiotics, and infections by these strains are difficult to treat. In many instances, only two oral antibiotics and a very limited group of intravenous antibiotics remain effective.

40|$|<b>Beta-lactams</b> exert their {{antibiotic}} action {{through their}} inhibition of bacterial DD-peptidases (penicillin-binding proteins). Bacteria, in general, carry several such enzymes localized {{on the outside}} of their cell membrane to catalyze the final step in cell wall (peptidoglycan) synthesis. They have been classified into two major groups, one of high molecular weight, the other of low. Members of the former group act as transpeptidases in vivo, and their inhibition by <b>beta-lactams</b> leads to cessation of bacterial growth. The latter group consists of DD-carboxypeptidases, and their inhibition by <b>beta-lactams</b> is generally not fatal to bacteria. We have previously shown that representatives of the former group are ineffective at catalyzing the hydrolysis/aminolysis of peptidoglycan-mimetic peptides in vitro [Anderson et al. (2003) Biochem. J. 373, 949 - 955]. The theme of these experiments is expanded in the present paper where we describe the synthesis of a series of <b>beta-lactams</b> (penicillins and cephalosporins) containing peptidoglycan-mimetic side chains and the kinetics of their inhibition of a panel of penicillin-binding proteins spanning the major classes (Escherichia coli PBP 2 and PBP 5, Streptococcus pneumoniae PBP 1 b, PBP 2 x and PBP 3, the Actinomadura R 39 DD-peptidase, and the Streptomyces R 61 DD-peptidase). The results of these experiments mirror and expand the previous results with peptides. Neither peptides nor <b>beta-lactams</b> with appropriate peptidoglycan-mimetic side chains react with the solubilized constructs of membrane-bound penicillin binding proteins (the first five enzymes above) at rates exceeding those of generic analogues. Such peptides and <b>beta-lactams</b> do react at greatly enhanced rates with certain soluble low molecular weight enzymes (R 61 and R 39 DD-peptidases).

Vmax values were calculated from the numbers of enzyme molecules produced per cell and from catalytic constant (Kcat) values, which were obtained with purified beta-lactamase. Minimal periplasmic antibiotic concentrations needed to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis were estimated from the Zimmermann-Rosselet equation. All the <b>beta-lactams</b> tested formed relatively stable complexes with purified beta-lactamase. The antibiotics that exhibited low affinity for beta-lactamase apparently needed higher periplasmic concentrations to inhibit cell wall synthesis, suggesting a possible correlation between the affinity of beta-lactamase and the affinity of penicillin-binding proteins for the new <b>beta-lactams.</b> By using these estimates of outer membrane permeability, beta-lactamase hydrolysis, and cell wall-inhibiting concentrations, MIC could be theoretically predicted to within 1 dilution for five <b>beta-lactams</b> in three isogenic E. cloacae strains with differences in antibiotic susceptibility due to different porin or beta-lactamase contents...|$|R
