40|$|AbstractUsing {{unconditional}} {{error correction}} approach, this article investigates equilibrium relationships between FDI inflows and their determinants (i. e., <b>broadest</b> <b>money</b> supply, consumer price index, exchange rates, gross domestic product, and trade). The observed findings reject {{the null hypothesis}} of no co-integration between the series. In addition, {{the results show that}} exchange rates, gross domestic product, <b>broadest</b> <b>money</b> supply, and trade have positive impact on FDI inflows. These findings could lead to further research questions that seek answers. For example, future work could add more variables to the function of inward FDI in Malaysia, such as unemployment and energy prices...|$|R

Three main conclusions are that the the best indicators (or measures) of monetary policy in Japan were <b>broader</b> <b>money</b> supply M 2 and commercial bank lendings, that the causal relationship from the call rate to output was weaker, and that M 2 can be controlled through adjustments of total base money and bank reserves...|$|R
40|$|Citing a {{break in}} the {{statistical}} association between the <b>broader</b> <b>money</b> aggregates and reserve money in the the post-reforms period of the 1990 s vis-a-vis the 1980 s, this paper argues that an endogenous money multiplier framework is best suited for analyzing the money supply process in India and questions the simplifying assumptions tending to justify stability and predictability of the money multiplier especially {{in the context of a}} deregulated financial system with market determined interest rates. An empirical analysis conducted using monthly data for the period April 1980 through March 2000 establishes this and traces the source of the endogeneity of these multipliers to a range of macroeconomic variables. ...|$|R
25|$|Up until 2007, {{there have}} been several {{favorable}} conditions that allowed the Central Bank of Egypt to accumulate net international reserves, which increased from US$20 billion in FY2005, to US$23 billion in FY2006, and to US$30 billion FY2007 contributing to growth in both reserve money and in <b>broad</b> <b>money</b> (M2). This declined to US$16.4 billion in Oct 2015, according to the Central Bank of Egypt.|$|E
25|$|The {{money supply}} {{of a country}} {{consists}} of currency (banknotes and coins) and, depending on the particular definition used, one or more types of bank money (the balances held in checking accounts, savings accounts, {{and other types of}} bank accounts). Bank money, which consists only of records (mostly computerized in modern banking), forms by far the largest part of <b>broad</b> <b>money</b> in developed countries.|$|E
25|$|The {{money supply}} {{of a country}} is usually held to be {{the total amount of}} {{currency}} in circulation plus the total value of checking and savings deposits in the commercial banks in the country. In modern economies, relatively little of the money supply is in physical currency. For example, in December 2010 in the U.S., of the $8853.4 billion in <b>broad</b> <b>money</b> supply (M2), only $915.7 billion (about 10%) consisted of physical coins and paper money.|$|E

40|$|U. S. consumers' {{demand for}} cash is {{estimated}} with new panel micro data for 2008 - 2010 using econometric methodology similar to Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin (2000); Attanasio, Guiso, and Jappelli (2002); and Lippi and Secchi (2009). We extend the Baumol-Tobin model {{to allow for}} credit card payments and revolving debt, as in Sastry (1970). With interest rates near zero, cash demand by consumers using credit cards for convenience (without revolving debt) has the same small, negative, interest elasticity as estimated in earlier periods and with <b>broader</b> <b>money</b> measures. However, cash demand by consumers using credit cards to borrow (with revolving debt) is interest inelastic. These findings may have aggregate implications for the welfare cost of inflation because then nontrivial share of consumers who revolve credit card debt {{are less likely to}} switch from cash to credit. In the 21 st century, consumers get cash from bank and nonbank sources with heterogeneous transactions costs, so withdrawal location is essential to identify cash demand properly...|$|R

40|$|As {{a way of}} {{addressing}} arguments in the literature (Rodrik, 1998) {{that the act of}} capital account liberalization leads to inflation, we present a simple theoretical model in which capital account liberalization raises the absolute value of the elasticity of money demand because agents have <b>broader</b> <b>money</b> holding options than under a closed capital account. The central bank maximizes seigniorage, balancing the benefits of higher inflation against potential losses of foreign currency reserves. The optimum seigniorage-maximizing rate of inflation falls when capital controls are loosened, {{as a result of the}} impact of liberalization on the elasticity of money demand. In a series of OLS and instrumental variables models that are heavily influenced by the work of Romer (1993) on current account openness and Grilli and Milesi-Ferretti (1995) on capital account openness, we test the impact of the act capital account liberalization (and many other factors) on inflation and find results that are consistent with our simple theoretical model and that are inconsistent with the recent work of Rodrik (1998).; Economic Research Working Paper 0104...|$|R
2500|$|The money {{multiplier}} is a heuristic used {{to demonstrate the}} maximum amount of <b>broad</b> <b>money</b> that could be created by commercial banks for a given fixed amount of base money and reserve ratio. This theoretical maximum is never reached, because some eligible reserves are held as cash outside of banks. Rather than holding the quantity of base money fixed, central banks have recently pursued an interest rate target to control bank issuance of credit indirectly so the ceiling implied by the {{money multiplier}} does not impose a limit on money creation in practice.|$|E
2500|$|Commercial {{bank money}} is created through fractional-reserve banking, the banking {{practice}} where banks keep {{only a fraction}} of their deposits in reserve (as cash and other highly liquid assets) and lend out the remainder, while maintaining the simultaneous obligation to redeem all these deposits upon demand. Commercial bank money differs from commodity and fiat money in two ways: firstly it is non-physical, as its existence is only reflected in the account ledgers of banks and other financial institutions, and secondly, there is some element of risk that the claim will not be fulfilled if the financial institution becomes insolvent. The process of fractional-reserve banking has a cumulative effect of money creation by commercial banks, as it expands money supply (cash and demand deposits) beyond what it would otherwise be. [...] Because of the prevalence of fractional reserve banking, the <b>broad</b> <b>money</b> supply of most countries is a multiple larger than the amount of base money created by the country's central bank. That multiple (called the money multiplier) is determined by the reserve requirement or other financial ratio requirements imposed by financial regulators.|$|E
2500|$|After Britain's {{exit from}} the ERM, Lamont had two major tasks: to replace the ERM with a new {{framework}} for monetary [...] to replace the ERM and to address the sharp increase in government borrowing caused by the recession and the rapid fall in inflation. In {{a letter to the}} Chairman of the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee in October 1992, Lamont set out a new basis for the conduct of monetary policy centred on inflation targeting. He set a target range for inflation excluding mortgage interest rate payments (which can otherwise lead to distortions) of 1 – 4%, falling into {{the lower part of the}} range by the end of the Parliament. In assessing progress toward meeting the inflation target, there was a target for the growth of narrow money (M0) and monitoring ranges for the growth of <b>broad</b> <b>money</b> (M4). Decisions on interest rates would also take account of house and asset price inflation and the exchange rate. Transparency and market credibility would be enhanced by publication of a monthly monetary assessment and the Bank of England was asked to produce a quarterly inflation report. These innovations marked a decisive break with the past and a necessary step toward central bank independence. Inflation targeting was the basis on which the Bank of England was made independent by the Blair government in 1997, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee being made accountable for achieving the government's inflation target.|$|E
