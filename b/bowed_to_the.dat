5|$|As {{the chief}} {{parliamentary}} spokesman for an abandoned policy, Calvert no longer served a useful purpose to the English Royal Court, and by February 1624 his duties had been restricted to placating the Spanish ambassador. The degree of his disfavour was shown {{when he was}} reprimanded for supposedly delaying diplomatic letters. Calvert <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inevitable. On the pretext of ill health, he began negotiations {{for the sale of}} his position, finally resigning the secretariat in February 1625.|$|E
5|$|The Stadio San Paolo was {{the only}} stadium during the {{competition}} where the Argentine National Anthem was not jeered, Maradona <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Napoli fans {{at the end and}} his country went on to reach the final. However, after the final, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) forced Maradona to take a doping test, which he failed testing positive for cocaine; both Maradona and Napoli staff later claimed it was a revenge plot for events at the World Cup. Maradona was banned for 15 months and would never play for the club again. The club still managed to win the Supercoppa Italiana that year, with a record 5–1 victory against Juventus, but it would be their last major trophy for 22 years. However, in the European Cup, they were eliminated in the second round.|$|E
5|$|During the 44-year {{reign of}} Emperor Xuanzong, the Tang dynasty reached its height, {{a golden age}} with low {{economic}} inflation and a toned down lifestyle for the imperial court. Seen as a progressive and benevolent ruler, Xuanzong even abolished {{the death penalty in}} the year 747; all executions had to be approved beforehand by the emperor himself (these were relatively few, considering that there were only 24 executions in the year 730). Xuanzong <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> consensus of his ministers on policy decisions and made efforts to staff government ministries fairly with different political factions. His staunch Confucian chancellor Zhang Jiuling (673–740) worked to reduce deflation and increase the money supply by upholding the use of private coinage, while his aristocratic and technocratic successor Li Linfu (d. 753) favored government monopoly over the issuance of coinage. After 737 most of Xuanzong's confidence rested in his long-standing chancellor Li Linfu, who championed a more aggressive foreign policy employing non-Chinese generals. This policy ultimately created the conditions for a massive rebellion against Xuanzong.|$|E

5|$|In response, the House of Commons {{prepared}} {{a set of}} four Resolutions, decrying these actions and restating the validity of Magna Carta and the legal requirement of habeas corpus. These were rejected by Charles, who also announced that Parliament would be dissolved; in response, the Commons met on 6 May to discuss alternatives, and concluded that a petition of right was the way forward. Accordingly, a committee under Sir Edward Coke drafted such a petition, and it {{was passed by the}} Commons on 8 May and sent to the House of Lords. After three weeks of debates and conferences between the two chambers, the Petition of Right was ratified by both houses on the 26th and 27 May. Following additional debates in which the King restricted the right of the Commons to freely speak, he <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pressure; in need of Parliamentary support for the war effort, the Petition was accepted on 2 June. Unhappy with the method chosen, both houses joined together and demanded the King fully ratify the Petition, which he did on 7 June.|$|E
5|$|The new English Parliament, which met in March of {{the same}} year, was quite hostile to Charles. Many members feared that he had {{intended}} to use the standing army to suppress dissent or impose Catholicism. However, with insufficient funds voted by Parliament, Charles was forced to gradually disband his troops. Having lost the support of Parliament, Danby resigned his post of Lord High Treasurer, but received a pardon from the king. In defiance of the royal will, the House of Commons declared that the dissolution of Parliament did not interrupt impeachment proceedings, and that the pardon was therefore invalid. When the House of Lords attempted to impose the punishment of exile—which the Commons thought too mild—the impeachment became stalled between the two Houses. As he had been {{required to do so}} many times during his reign, Charles <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wishes of his opponents, committing Danby to the Tower of London, in which he was held for another five years.|$|E
5|$|The scapula {{was short}} with a {{moderately}} expanded upper end. The coracoid was circular in side view. The {{elements of the}} forelimb were generally moderately long, straight and stout. The hand is only known from recent discoveries and {{has not yet been}} described. In the rather wide pelvis, the ilium was straight in side view. Its front blade was rod-shaped and moderately splayed to the outside, creating room for the belly. This was reinforced by the sacral ribs becoming longer towards the front. The sacral ribs were wider at their attachment areas with the ilium, but were not fused into a sacral yoke. The pubis featured a short prepubis. The pubis shaft was straight, running parallel to a straight ischium shaft that was transversely flattened at its lower end. The thighbone was straight in side view, in front view it was somewhat <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outside. Its head was not separated from the shaft by a real neck. While the major trochanter was at about the same level as the head, the lower minor trochanter was separated from both by a deep cleft. At it rear side, the femur mid-shaft featured a well-developed drooping fourth trochanter, a process for the attachment of the retractor tail muscle, the Musculus caudofemoralis longus. The lower leg was somewhat shorter than the thighbone. The tibia had a wide upper end, with a cnemial crest protruding well to the front. The tibia lower end was also robust and rotated about 70° compared to the upper part, turning the foot strongly to the outside. The foot was very large and wide. The fifth metatarsal was only rudimentary but the other four were robust. Scelidosaurus had four large toes, with the innermost digit being the smallest. The fourth metatarsal was short but its toe was long and built to be splayed to the outside of the foot, to improve the stability. The claws were flat, hoof-shaped and curved to the inside.|$|E

Hugues de Toucy, Archbishop of Sens, presided, and Louis and Eleanor were both present, as were the Archbishops of Bordeaux and Rouen. Archbishop Samson of Reims acted for Eleanor.|$|E

Kerr would only acquiesce to a dozen. The book, The Double-Cross System in the War of 193945, was finally published in February 1972, with a foreword by Pearson, who guardedly did not refer to his work in the Committee. Masterman himself wrote the book without revealing anything about Ultra, still highly secret, that greatly aided the double-cross system. The ban on Ultra would be lifted in 1974.|$|E

25|$|The 1909 {{death of}} Carlos VII turned {{political}} fortunes of de Cerralbo, who consulted {{by the new}} claimant Don Jaime advised that as a Carlist king he should adopt the name of Jaime III. Many distinguished Carlists pressed the pretender to dismiss Feliú and re-appoint Cerralbo. The claimant <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pressure in 1912, creating a collective governing body, Junta Superior Central Tradicionalista, with de Cerralbo as its president. A number of authors claim that de Cerralbo was the de facto Jefe Delegado and the press, like many contemporaries, presented him as such. The competitive theory maintains that de Mella, sensing the forthcoming clash with Don Jaime, assumed that aging and sick Cerralbo, his old-time friend, {{would be easier to}} manipulate; some claim that following the appointment it was actually de Mella who was running the party.|$|E
25|$|He {{worked to}} {{maintain}} a strong network of contacts among anti-fascist intellectuals throughout Italy, {{while much of the}} Italian academic world <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> regime. With his former students and followers Ernesto Rossi and Carlo Rosselli he founded the first clandestine anti-fascist newspaper Non mollare (Don't Give Up) in January 1925. A half year later he was arrested and put on trial, but was released on a technicality, although he was kept under surveillance. Threats against his life were published in the Fascist press and his lawyer was beaten to death by Fascist blackshirts. His name was on top of the list of the Fascist death squads during raids on 4 October 1925 in Florence. However, Salvemini had fled to France in August 1925. He was dismissed from the University of Florence and his Italian citizenship was revoked in 1926.|$|E
25|$|The premiere {{was given}} at the Königliches Hof- und National-Theater, Munich, on June 21, 1868. The {{production}} was sponsored by Ludwig II of Bavaria and the conductor was Hans von Bülow. Franz Strauss, {{the father of the}} composer Richard Strauss played the French horn at the premiere, despite his often-expressed dislike of Wagner, who was present at many of the rehearsals. Wagner's frequent interruptions and digressions made rehearsals a very long-winded affair. After one 5 hour rehearsal, Franz Strauss led a strike by the orchestra, saying that he could not play any more. Despite these problems, the premiere was a triumph, and the opera was hailed as one of Wagner's most successful works. At {{the end of the first}} performance, the audience called for Wagner, who appeared at the front of the Royal box, which he had been sharing with King Ludwig. Wagner <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crowd, breaking court protocol, which dictated that only the monarch could address an audience from the box.|$|E

25|$|Sadat {{took several}} {{measures}} to decentralize {{power to the}} provinces and towns. Governors acquired more authority under Law Number 43 of 1979, which reduced the administrative and budgetary controls {{of the central government}} over the provinces. The elected councils acquired, at least formally, the right to approve or disapprove the local budget. In an effort to reduce local demands on the central treasury, local government was given wider powers to raise local taxes. But local representative councils became vehicles of pressure for government spending, and the soaring deficits of local government bodies had to be covered by the central government. Local government was encouraged to enter into joint ventures with private investors, and these ventures stimulated an alliance between government officials and the local rich that paralleled the infitah alliance at the national level. Under Mubarak decentralization and local autonomy became more of a reality, and local policies often reflected special local conditions. Thus, officials in Upper Egypt often <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> powerful Islamic movement there, while those in the port cities struck alliances with importers.|$|E
25|$|By 17 February, Soviet {{infantry}} and cavalry divisions supported by aircraft {{were less than}} 15 kilometers northeast of Tbilisi. The Georgian army put up a stubborn fight {{in defense of the}} approaches to the capital, which they held for a week in the face of overwhelming Red Army superiority. From 18 to 20 February, the strategic heights of Kojori and Tabakhmela passed from hand to hand in heavy fighting. Georgian forces under General Giorgi Mazniashvili managed to push the Soviets back inflicting heavy losses; they quickly regrouped and tightened the circle around Tbilisi. By 23 February, the railway bridges had been restored, and Soviet tanks and armoured trains joined in a renewed assault on the capital. While the armoured trains laid down suppressing fire, tanks and infantry penetrated the Georgian positions on the Kojori heights. On 24 February, the Georgian commander-in-chief, Giorgi Kvinitadze, <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inevitable and ordered a withdrawal to save his army from complete encirclement and the city from destruction. The Georgian government and the Constituent Assembly evacuated to Kutaisi in western Georgia, which dealt the Georgian army a significant moral blow.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fifteenth}} regular season {{game against the}} Minnesota Timberwolves, Anthony entered the game leading the league in points per game (30.2) and was the only {{player in the league}} to score at least 20 points in every game. He {{finished}} the game with 22 points which was his fifteenth consecutive game with at least 20 points breaking the previous franchise record of 14 straight set by English. The following game, Anthony scored a career-high 50 points in a home game against the New York Knicks while teammate Chauncey Billups added 32 points in the game, making them only the third duo in NBA history to score at least 50 and 30 points respectively. Two days later, Anthony scored 19 points in the first quarter—tying a season-high he made in the fourth quarter against the Portland Trail Blazers on October 29—in a home loss to the Timberwolves, 106-100, {{on the way to a}} total of 32 points. On January 21, 2010, Anthony was named as a starter for the 2010 NBA All-Star Game leading the Western Conference ballots in votes for forwards. This was Anthony's third All-Star appearance and second as a starter. He finished the game with a team-high 27 points and 10 rebounds, in a losing effort as the team <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Conference team.|$|E
