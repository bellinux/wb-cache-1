According to the simulation experiments, the time-frequency space characteristics of short-time Fourier transform, Wigner-Ville distribution and S-transform are contrasted.

Compare with the time-frequency spectrum of three different analysis methods under various noise conditions, {{it is obvious that}} S-transform has much better anti-noise performance than that of traditional methods for non-stationary signal processing.

Previous researchers have emphasized that perfectionist attitudes and thought action-fusion link to increase in obsessive compulsive symptom severity in clinical and nonclinical samples.

The aim of this study was determination of the prevalence of toxoplasmosis in primigrvida women in Hamadan. Materials & Methods: In this cross sectional study a total of 576 primigravida women, who admitted to the health centers were selected by cluster random sampling method. Data for epidemiological factors was collected by a questionnaire and serum samples were collected for detection of total antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii. The titer of ≥ 1 : 20 regarded as positive. The relationship <b>between</b> variables <b>analyzed</b> <b>by</b> chi² test. Results: In this study seroprevalence was 33. 5 %. Higher seropositivity observed in illiterate subgroup and lower infection rate was found in high school educated subgroup.

40|$|Increasingly, reverse {{transcriptase}} {{polymerase chain reaction}} (RT – PCR) is used to detect clinically significant tumour cells in blood or bone marrow. This {{may result in a}} redefinition of disease-free and clinical relapse. However, its clinical utility may be limited by lack of automation or reproducibility. Recent studies have suggested nucleic acid sequence-based amplification of target RNA may be more robust. In this study, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification was established to detect melanoma, colorectal and prostate cancer cells. Nucleic acid sequence-based amplification and RT – PCR both successfully amplified target RNA in peripheral blood samples from patients with melanoma and colorectal cancer, but only RT – PCR detected PSA in blood samples from patients with prostate cancer. There was relatively good agreement <b>between</b> sample replicates <b>analyzed</b> <b>by</b> RT – PCR (Kappa values of one for tyrosinase, 0. 67 for CK- 20 and one for PSA), but less agreement when <b>analyzed</b> <b>by</b> nucleic acid sequence-based amplification.
