50|$|He was a plant {{supervisor}} at the Hat Corporation of America. He also owned the Stack Hats Company. In {{response to the}} Cavanagh Edge, a method of creating a firm edge on hats, Stack invented a two-piece iron that forced the felt {{along the edge of}} a hat brim into a groove during the ironing process, thereby creating a <b>beaded</b> <b>edge</b> during the finishing process.|$|R
50|$|The font is {{transitional}} Norman of {{the late}} 12th century, belonging to the earliest known church. It has an octagonal bowl with <b>beaded</b> <b>edges</b> and a circular stem flanked by octagonal shafts with moulded bases. The steps and paving on which it stands are very much later - circa 1901. Beside the font is a strong mediaeval iron-bound chest known as a 'Peter's Pence' chest.|$|R

5000|$|The medal {{was made}} in both gold and silver. It {{measures}} 58 mm in diameter, nearly 20 mm more than a campaign medal. The obverse of the medal depicts the diademed effigy of Queen Victoria, wearing a veil which falls {{over the back of}} the head and neck. Around the <b>beaded</b> <b>edge</b> of the medal is inscribed Victoria 1st January 1877. The reverse bears the inscription Empress of India in English and Hind-ka-Kesar in Hindustani and Persian. Around the edge is a repeating decorative design.|$|R
5000|$|Amount {{is listed}} as a percentage, and {{controls}} the magnitude of each overshoot (how much darker and how much lighter the edge borders become). This can also {{be thought of as}} how much contrast is added at the edges. It does not affect the width of the <b>edge</b> <b>rims.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Two {{small plates}} (respectively 188 and 185mm in diameter; weights 539 and 613 g.) are {{decorated}} in {{precisely the same}} style as the Great Dish: one shows the god Pan, playing his pipes, and a maenad playing the double flute, and the other shows a dancing satyr with a dancing maenad. [...] Both of these small dishes have scratched graffiti in Greek on their undersides: [...] eutheriou, meaning '(property) of Eutherios'. [...] Both also have a bold <b>beaded</b> <b>edging,</b> as does the Great Dish itself and several other items in the assemblage.|$|R
5000|$|Radius {{affects the}} size of the edges to be {{enhanced}} or how wide the <b>edge</b> <b>rims</b> become, so a smaller radius enhances smaller-scale detail. Higher Radius values can cause halos at the edges, a detectable faint light rim around objects. Fine detail needs a smaller Radius. Radius and Amount interact; reducing one allows more of the other.|$|R
2500|$|Construction of the {{original}} 1841-42 building is in traditional heavy masonry walls two feet thick. [...] The ceilings are high: 15' on the first floor, 14' on the second. There are several large structural arch openings in the interior masonry walls. The exposed floor joists are heavy 4x10 <b>beaded</b> <b>edge</b> ausubo wood members laid 24" [...] on center. These old joists support modern concrete slab second floor laid over wire mesh and composition board forms laid during the 20th century remodeling.

50|$|This is a worn, torn up, and eroded crater {{formation}} {{with several}} small craters along the <b>rim</b> <b>edge.</b> The <b>rim</b> {{is the most}} heavily worn at the northern end, but is more intact {{to the east and}} west.

50|$|This crater {{has been}} heavily worn by {{subsequent}} impacts, leaving {{the rim and}} interior battered and cratered. There is a small crater attached to {{the exterior of the}} rim to the southeast, and the remains of a similar-sized crater along the southern edge. Small craterlets lie across the northwest, west, and southwestern <b>rim</b> <b>edges.</b> The remaining <b>rim</b> <b>edge</b> is rounded from impact erosion. A small craterlet lies almost at the crater midpoint.|$|R
50|$|The rim of Tamm is {{worn and}} eroded, with old impact rims {{incising}} the northern <b>edges.</b> The <b>rim</b> <b>edge</b> {{is now a}} circular, uneven ring of ridges. The interior floor is level and is marked only by tiny craterlets and a few clefts along the edges. The floor has merged with the interior of van den Bos to the south.|$|R
50|$|The rim of this crater is {{generally}} circular, but the edge is irregular {{and in some}} locations has a notched appearance. This is particularly true along the southwest and the eastern <b>edges.</b> The <b>rim</b> projects above {{the surface of the}} Mare Frigoris, and a wrinkle ridge runs several crater diameters to the southeast from the <b>edge.</b> The western <b>rim</b> is attached to rough terrain to the west and northwest.|$|R
25|$|The Permo-Triassic {{rocks of}} the Cheshire basin are heavily faulted. The longer {{axis of the}} basin trends towards the NNE, being flanked on the west by the Carboniferous rocks of north Wales and to the east by the Pennine Foothills. The dips in the Permo-Triassic rocks reflect the steady swing of the beds round the {{north-east}} <b>edge</b> <b>rim</b> of the Cheshire basin, except {{to the north of}} Alderley Edge, where a gentle anticlinal fold centred on Wilmslow plunges westward and is intersected by a number of north-south tension faults.|$|R

50|$|The outer rim of Katchalsky is {{not quite}} circular, with outward bulges {{to the east and}} north, giving it a flat side along the northeastern <b>edge.</b> The <b>rim</b> is not {{markedly}} eroded, and the interior contains only a few tiny craterlets.|$|R
50|$|The northwestern half of {{the crater}} rim is well-formed, with some {{slumping}} and terraces along the inner walls. There is an outward protrusion in the rim along the northern side where the crater borders along Pawsey. The {{southern part of the}} crater is more irregular, with a wider, uneven inner wall and a poorly defined <b>rim</b> <b>edge.</b> The <b>rim</b> overlies about {{half of the}} heavily worn satellite crater Wiener K along the south-southeast. The smaller satellite crater Wiener Q lies along the southwestern rim, and the relatively fresh and polygon-shaped Wiener F is attached to the eastern rim.|$|R

50|$|This is a well-eroded crater formation, with {{a rounded}} and uneven <b>rim</b> <b>edge.</b> The {{satellite}} crater Paraskevopoulos H lies across the eastern rim, {{and the smaller}} Paraskevopoulos E {{is located in the}} northeastern part of the interior floor. The <b>rim</b> <b>edge</b> is better defined along the northern and southern edges, and is nearly worn away along the west. The surviving interior floor is relatively level and featureless, with only a pair of small craterlets along the northwestern and southeastern edges.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{comprehensive}} object categorization and classification system, of great importance for mobile manipulation applications in indoor environments. In detail, we tackle the problem of recognizing everyday objects that are useful for a personal robotic assistant in fulfilling its tasks, using a hierarchical multi-modal 3 D- 2 D processing and classification system. The acquired 3 D data is used to estimate geometric labels (plane, cylinder, <b>edge,</b> <b>rim,</b> sphere) at each voxel cell using the Radius-based Surface Descriptor (RSD). Then, we propose {{the use of a}} Global RSD feature (GRSD) to categorize point clusters that are geometrically identical into one of the object categories. Once a geometric category and a 3 D position is obtained for each object cluster, we extract the region of interest in the camera image and compute a SURF-based feature vector for it. Thus we obtain the exact object instanc...|$|R

50|$|This is a {{worn and}} eroded crater {{formation}} that has {{still managed to}} retain much of its original shape. The remains of a small crater lie across the southern floor and inner wall of Smoluchowski, protruding outwards slightly into Poczobutt. A smaller crater lies along the inner wall of the southwestern rim, and a small craterlet lies across the north-northwestern <b>rim</b> <b>edge.</b> Along the surface connecting Smoluchowski with Paneth is an elongated depression in the surface that overlies the <b>rim</b> <b>edge</b> and inner wall of Smoluchowski.
