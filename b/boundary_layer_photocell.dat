This evolution is thought to control the development of <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> clouds. This study examines the dependence of <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> relative humidity on soil moisture, large-scale vertical motion, and the moisture content and temperature stratification above the <b>boundary</b> <b>layer.</b> The response of the <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> relative humidity to external forcing involves competing mechanisms and the net effect on relative humidity is difficult to predict without complete analysis of the relative humidity tendency equation. As one example, drier soil leads to smaller <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> specific humidity but also leads to cooler temperatures at the <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> top due to greater <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> growth. When the latter effect dominates, the relative humidity at the <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> top is greater over drier soil. In contrast, drier soil leads to lower relative humidity at the <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> top when the air above the <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> is strongly stratified or quite dry.
