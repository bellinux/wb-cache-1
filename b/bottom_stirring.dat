40|$|This {{bachelor}} degree project is about determining {{the impact that}} additional <b>bottom</b> <b>stirring</b> may have on the desulphurization process at SSAB Luleå. During one week of field work steel samples were collected from 39 different heats. 31 of the heats were samples with the <b>bottom</b> <b>stirring</b> function enabled and the remaining 8 heats without the bottom blowing function, which is the standard method today at SSAB Luleå {{and they can be}} referred as references. Data from 15 old reference heats were also used for analysis. Two different behaviors of <b>bottom</b> <b>stirring</b> appeared and they were therefore separated to type 1 and type 2 <b>bottom</b> <b>stirring.</b> Type 1 <b>bottom</b> <b>stirring</b> turned out to have highest possibility of all methods to reach dissolved sulfur content of maximum 0. 001 %. If the ingoing dissolved sulfur content is around 0. 03 % has type 1 <b>bottom</b> <b>stirring</b> 33 % chance to reach 0. 001 % dissolved sulfur content already after 13. 3 minutes of injection and that can save sulfur reagents. The method with highest reagent efficiency showed type 1 <b>bottom</b> <b>stirring</b> to have, on second place came type 2 <b>bottom</b> <b>stirring</b> and the references showed to have lowest reagent efficiency...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model has been}} developed to analyze the transient three-dimensional and three-phase flow in a <b>bottom</b> <b>stirring</b> ladle with a centered porous plug, which {{takes into account the}} steel, gas, and slag phases; it enables us to predict the fluid flow and heat transfer in the very important steel/slag region. The numerical results of the present model show that the obtained relationship between nondimensional areas of slag eye and the Froude number is in good agreement with the reported data...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject is}} {{reviewed}} from the viewpoints of theory, internal tide and wave structure and their implications. A wider theoretical context suggests scope for further investigation of natural or nearly-trapped forms above the inertial frequency. Although internal tides in many locations are observed to have first-mode vertical structure, higher modes are seen offshore from shallow shelf-break forcing and for particular Froude numbers, {{and may be}} expected locally near generation. Bottom intensification is often observed where the sea floor matches the characteristic slope. Solitons form from internal tides of large amplitude or at large changes of depth. Internal tides and solitons are observed also at many sills and in straits, and to intensify in canyons. Non-linear effects of the waves, especially solitons, include the conveyance of water, nutrients, ‘‘mixing potential'’ etc. away from their source to other locations, and the generation of mean currents. The waves transfer energy and possibly heat between the ocean and shelf, may {{be a source of}} medium frequency waves on the shelf (periods of minutes) and can contribute to interior mixing and overturning, <b>bottom</b> <b>stirring</b> and sediment movement...|$|E
50|$|Lepidurus apus is omnivorous, {{feeding on}} both plant matter, mostly {{floating}} detritus, and small aquatic invertebrates such as Branchinecta and Daphnia. It swims along the <b>bottom</b> of ponds, <b>stirring</b> up the substrate as it forages. The genus Lepidurus also feeds upon algae, myxozoa, bacteria and fungi.|$|R
5000|$|It is a fish of {{mountain}} streams and lakes, favoring clear {{cold water and}} large deep pools {{of at least a}} meter depth; the Lake Tahoe population lives just above the bottom in deeper water. Mountain whitefish are <b>bottom</b> feeders, <b>stirring</b> up the substrate with pectoral and tail fins to expose insect larvae and other invertebrates, including snails, crayfish, and amphipods. Their main feeding time is in the evening, but they will also take drifting prey during the day. The mountain whitefish frequently feeds in the lower strata of streams, but populations may rise to the surface to prey on hatching insects, including mayflies.|$|R
50|$|Much {{work was}} devoted to the careful design of the general layout, {{pressure}} hull and other unpressurized compartments, main and auxiliary propulsion systems, hydraulic systems, auxiliary power unit and piping system, electrical system, observation and navigational systems, underwater lighting system, salvage system, life support and safety system. This resulted in the optimum compromise reached for the best performance, which was claimed to be {{equal to that of}} foreign designs, and in some areas, such as hovering and sideway movements, designers of Osprey submersible have claimed that it outperforms its foreign counterparts. The submersible is capable of hovering three meters above the <b>bottom</b> without <b>stirring</b> up the sediment, thus enables its operator to clearly observe objects ten meters away at the bottom.|$|R
40|$|In {{secondary}} steelmaking, {{the enhancement}} of the reaction rate in the low carbon period during the decarburization of steel is considered the most effective method to produce ultralow carbon steel. In a previous study, {{it was revealed that}} the surface reaction is dominant during the final stage of the actual refining process. In order to improve the surface reaction rate, it is necessary to enlarge the reaction region, which is usually achieved by increasing the plume eye area. In this study, water model experiments were carried out to estimate the influence of <b>bottom</b> <b>stirring</b> conditions on the gas-liquid reaction rate; for this purpose, the deoxidation rate during the bottom bubbling process was measured. Five types of nozzle configurations were used to study the effect of the plume eye area on the reaction rate at various gas flow rates. The results reveal that the surface reaction rate is influenced by the gas flow rate and the plume eye area. An empirical correlation was developed for the reaction rate and the plume eye area. This correlation was applied to estimate the gas-liquid reaction rate mat the bath surface...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{knowledge}} of physical-oceanographic processes is reviewed {{for the eastern}} shelf-edge boundary of the Rockall Channel. A year-round northward current flows along the steep continental slope. Mean currents vary from 3 to 30 cm/s, generally increasing northwards, but estimates of transport inshore of the 2000 m depth contour are much more consistent, averaging about 1 · 5 × 106 m 3 /s. The current {{is thought to be}} forced largely by a long-shelf pressure gradient, associated with large-scale N-S density variations in the upper ocean. Although cross-slope changes of temperature and salinity are much less than occur, for example, east of the U. S. A., cross-slope exchange velocities appear to be only around 2 cm/s (1 / 5 of long-slope fluctuations). There is a sharp change between winter-cooled water on the shelf and adjacent slope water. Upwelling against the upper continental slope may occur following northerly long-slope winds. Tidal currents and surges depend strongly on continental shelf wave properties. At near-diurnal frequencies, and in response to winds of short scale (< 100 km), clockwise-rotating currents near the shelf break are expected, especially where the shelf is broadest. Tidal currents show this character. Internal tides are significant; any non-linearity is most likely when stratification is present but weak. <b>Bottom</b> <b>stirring</b> has been observed, and may be important at some depth (where the bottom slope becomes as steep as the semi-diurnal internal characteristics) almost everywhere around the Rockall Channel. The energetic internal waves should contribute significant internal mixing as they approach the shelf break, intensify and dissipate...|$|E
40|$|A 24 -h {{time series}} of {{high-resolution}} vertical profiles of salinity, temperature, NO 3 and fluorescence were taken during spring and neap tides at an anchored station (station 2) in the Strait of Georgia, 8 km seaward {{of the mouth}} of the Fraser River in order to estimate entrainment of NO 3 resulting from the outflowing riverine plume. The time series confirmed that more NO 3 was entrained during the spring tide (24 mmol m" 2) than during the neap tide (17 mmol m" 2). The contribution of the entrained NO 3 was 2 · 3 and 1 · 6 times that of the river-borne NO 3 during spring and neap tides, respectively. We hypothesize that spring tides cause stronger <b>bottom</b> <b>stirring</b> which results in higher NO 3 concentrations in the deep seawater which is the source of NO 3 that is entrained upward. The results from the times series taken during days of diVerent river discharge show that during higher river discharge (9000 m 3 s" 1) more NO 3 (72 mmol m " 2) was entrained than during lower (6720 m 3 s" 1) river discharge (32 mmol m" 2). The entrained NO 3 was 5 · 4 times that of the river-borne NO 3 during the higher river discharge and 3 · 3 times during the lower discharge. The mechanism which explains the greater NO 3 entrainment is that greater river discharge pushes the estuarine plume seaward, further from the river mouth, and therefore there is a larger area of deep seawater (with higher NO 3 concentrations) exposed directly to the riverine plume for entrainment...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} <b>bottom</b> inert gas <b>stirring</b> in ladle {{metallurgy}} {{is dominated by}} manual control. However, this type of control has considerable limitations in process optimization. Various researchers have used vibration, sound and image signals to predict the degree of stirring inside the vessel. In literature, there is limited treatment of detecting stirring at low flow rates and interpreting vibration signals. Principal component analysis of triaxial vibration data collected from a cold model shows that low flow rate stirring can be measured using signals from vibration sensors if the frequency ranges considered is carefully chosen...|$|R
40|$|A water {{model was}} adopted to {{physically}} simulate the <b>bottom</b> gas <b>stirring</b> inside an ironmaking smelter. The water model experiments {{were conducted to}} investigate {{the erosion of the}} bottom refractory lining near the tuyere tip under different gas bottom blowing conditions. In experiments, the major parameters are the gas flow rate, and the inside diameter and placement of bottom blowing tuyeres. The {{purpose of this study is}} to provide a design and operation reference of the gas bottom blowing system for CSC’s Ironmaking Smelter. A transparent acrylic water model, which is 60 % of the actual furnace’s size, is used to study the erosion of the bottom refractory lining near the tuyere tips. The experiments suggested that the erosion rate of specimens near the tuyere tips reduced with a decrease in the gas flow rate. In the case of the triangle-corners-center placement of four bottom blowing tuyeres, the lowest erosion rate of boric acid specimen...|$|R
5000|$|Edwin L. Brady {{obtained}} {{a patent on}} boats for dredging under water. The patented dredge boat consisted of [...] "a strong boat, propelled preferably by [...] [...] [...] two propellers placed in {{the stern of the}} boat" [...] and driven by a steam engine. The use of two propellers made [...] "the boat more manageable in steering in crooked channels." [...] Near the bow of the boat, Brady placed another steam engine driving a [...] "mud fan," [...] like a propeller but with sharper blades, extending two feet below the bottom of the boat. [...] "Their object is, by their rapid revolution, to displace the sand and mud on the <b>bottom</b> and, <b>stirring</b> them up, to mix them with the water so that they may be carried off by the current." [...] The boat has a series of watertight compartments into or out of which water is pumped so as to sink the vessel to the required depth for dredging.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} demand to reduce and control the amount of dissolved gases in steel. Hydrogen and nitrogen are two of the most important gases which when dissolved in liquid steel affect its properties significantly. Several steelmaking additions have been investigated in this research for their effect on the hydrogen and nitrogen content of steels. It has been established that calcium hydroxide (hydrated lime) acts as a source of hydrogen. Carburizers, such as metallurgical coke, were found to result in no hydrogen pickup when added to liquid steel. Addition of petroleum coke, on the other hand, increased the hydrogen content of liquid steel. Ferroalloy such as medium carbon ferromanganese when added to the liquid iron was found to increase its nitrogen content, the increase being proportional to the amount of ferroalloy added. Similarly, addition of pitch coke, which had a significant nitrogen impurity, increased the nitrogen content of liquid iron. A mathematical model was developed to quantify the absorption of nitrogen and hydrogen from the air bubbles entrained during tapping of liquid steel. During the <b>bottom</b> <b>stirring</b> of liquid metal in a ladle, the inert gas escaping from the top displaces the slag layer and often forms an open eye. The absorption of atmospheric nitrogen through the spout eye was estimated for different slag thickness and gas flow rate. The ultimate goal of this research was to develop a comprehensive set of equations which could predict the nitrogen and hydrogen pickup from their various sources. Estimates of hydrogen and nitrogen pickup during the steel transfer operations such as tapping and ladle stirring and the predicted pickup from steelmaking additions were integrated into empirical equations. The comprehensive model is designed to predict the gas pickup under varying operating conditions such as the metal oxygen and sulfur content, the total tapping or stirring time, the stirring gas flow rate and the slag thickness. The model predictions are based on mathematical and empirical evidence which are derived from thermodynamic and kinetic fundamental principles...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays Great Brittain is {{separated}} from the European Continent by the North Sea. This, however, hasn’t always been the case. Due to sea-level changes {{as a result of}} climatic changes and the cyclical repetition of glacials and interglacials the North Sea Basin has repeatedly been exposed to the open-air during the Pleistocene. Numerous finds, recovered by fishermen and dredgers while executing their work, indicate that this glacial plane was inhabited by a wide variety of animal species. It is beginning to become clear, due to the recovery of worked flint material, that early human must {{have been part of the}} inhabitants. The importance of the North Sea Basin for archaeological research has repeatedly been stressed. The archaeology in the seabed is threatened by several activities that affect the North Sea bottom. The trawling of fish boats, the construction of oil rigs and offshore windmill parks and the marine aggregate industry all have a huge effect on the seabed, possibly destroying archaeological remains while executed. The actual implementation of archaeological fieldwork as part of these <b>bottom</b> <b>stirring</b> activities is minimal and mainly focused on maritime archaeology. The goal of this thesis is to explore the possibilities for palaeolithic research in the North Sea Basin. It does so by analyzing archaeological research on-land and it’s possibilities for offshore archaeology and by evaluating different projects that have been set up over the last year to improve Paleolithic archaeological research on the North Sea bed over the border. In this way the strengths and weaknesses of the research as it is executed this days can be reviewed. The outcome should lead to new insights and a best-practice for setting up a solid archaeological research strategy before the execution of bottom disturbing activities. Crucial to this research strategy is a multidisciplinary approach in which the potential of all executed steps is explored. Recent research methods can be improved by changing the current focus on the object to a focus on the context of archaeological remains. Paleolithic material is useless without knowledge about the landscape and environment in which it has been used and deposited...|$|E
40|$|Gas {{stirring}} {{is commonly}} used in the chemical and mineral industries to enhance heat and mass transfer in reaction vessels. However, {{it is difficult to}} quantify the stirring effect directly, thus its control is mostly dominated by manual procedures. In the case of <b>bottom</b> gas <b>stirring</b> in secondary steelmaking, the stirring often creates a disturbance {{at the top of the}} vessel which is called “ladle eye” or “spout eye” and can be observed by the operators. Furthermore, the stirring process also generates sound and vibration signals which are closely related to each other. In practice, operators make judgements about the process through visual observation and listening to the sound in order to determine their following procedures. In this study, we gathered image, sound and vibration data from cold model experiments, and established techniques for analysing the combined signals by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) techniques. The result shows that the dominant principal component derived from the combined signals does capture the great majority of the variation in the system and that online analysis of the stirring process is feasible using this latent variable...|$|R
40|$|Hunting {{tactics of}} potamotrygonid {{freshwater}} rays remain unreported under natural conditions. Three main foraging tactics of Potamotrygon falkneri and P. motoro are described here based on underwater observations {{in the upper}} Parana River. Both species displayed similar behaviors. The most common tactic was to undulate the disc margins close to, or on, the <b>bottom</b> and thus <b>stirring</b> the substrate and uncovering hidden preys. Another tactic was to charge upon prey concentrated in the shallows. The least common tactic was to pick out prey adhered to the substrate. The first tactic is widespread in several species of marine rays in the Dasyatidae, whereas the remainder (especially picking up prey on substrata above water surface) may be restricted to the Potamotrygonidae...|$|R
25|$|Adding {{as little}} as 10-15% shell temper created an {{excellent}} pottery paste that was lighter, stronger and more able to withstand the drying process, and the clay's originally high plasticity was subdued. The calcium carbonate of the freshwater mussels also acts as a binding agent and created a stronger vessel. Thinner coils to make thinner walled vessel were a natural consequence. As the potter was probably also the cook, she was now able to construct a more effective cooking pot. Thinner walls allowed heat to transfer to the food more effectively. A round vessel <b>bottom</b> allows easy <b>stirring</b> of the contents, a more even dissipation of the cooking heat and also permits a more even dispersion of the shock of impacts reducing breakage.|$|R

40|$|The inverse estuarine {{circulation}} {{through the}} strait of Gibraltar {{is responsible for}} the overflow of dense, saline MOW towards the Atlantic basin. Initially as a gravity undercurrent, the MOW entrains large amounts of the overlying Eastern North Atlantic CentralWater to become a multi-layered, buoyant plume at depths of 800 - 1300 m past Cape St. Vincent. Much of the entrainment occurs within 100 km of the Strait over a highly abrupt topography. In this work we analyze a repeated series of high-resolution CTD-LADCP observations along a number of standard sections crossing the early MOW. These data show that from the Strait of Gibraltar, the bottom-trapped flow bifurcates {{in the vicinity of the}} topographic features, diverting or rejoining the main MOWpath as a function of the orientation of channels and valleys. As it turns anticyclonically, the undercurrent exhibits a cross-axis geostrophic gradient, with the margin closer to the slope being in near-geostrophic balance whereas the distal band is largely ageostrophic due to the flow curvature. Mixing is steered by the interplay of tidal <b>stirring,</b> <b>bottom</b> roughness, shear instability and double diffusion along the MOWpath. Data also shows that seasonal variability is mostly related to the fluctuations in the overlying layer rather than to MOW dynamics.

40|$|To aid {{efficient}} use of the gas flow rate for a smelting reduction furnace, this study investigates the effect of gas <b>bottom</b> blowing and <b>stirring</b> on the mixing time of the molten iron phase. In this study, transparent acrylic is used to construct a water model, which is 60 % {{as big as the}} original experimental melting reduction furnace of the China Steel Corporation. The mixing time of the molten iron phase in the water model is measured by using gas bottom blowing and changing the number of tuyeres (from three to five), the tuyere placement, the tuyere size (6. 0 – 15. 0 mm), and the gas flow rate per tuyere (80 – 120 NL/min). The mixing trials adopt KCl as an indicator and use water filtrated using reverse osmosis (RO) in place of liquid iron to investigate the effect of gas bottom blowing conditions on mixing of the molten iron phase. The experimental results indicate that in the cases of four tuyeres in the square-corner and triangle-corner-center placements, 10. 0 mm tuyeres yield the shortest mixing time (and thus the best mixing effect) under different total gas flow rates. In the case of five tuyeres in the square-corner-center placement, 10. 0 mm tuyeres also have the shortest mixing time under total gas flow rates of 400 NL/min and 500 NL/min. However, 12. 5 mm tuyeres have the shortest mixing time under a total gas flow rate of 600 NL/min. In addition, in the case of three tuyeres in the triangle-corner placement, 12. 5 mm tuyeres have the shortest mixing time under different total gas flow rates. When the gas flow rate per tuyere is 80 NL/min, the fewer the tuyeres, the shorter the mixing time. Depending on tuyere placement, some of the energy injected by the gas may be counteracted. For example, when a bottom-blowing tuyere exists in the center, the gas injection from that tuyere may be counteracted by that of adjacent tuyeres such that energy dissipates. In contrast, a tuyer...|$|R
