5|$|Because of its {{unstable}} nature, astronomers {{now consider}} the scattered disc to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of origin for most periodic comets in the Solar System, with the centaurs, {{a population of}} icy bodies between Jupiter and Neptune, being the intermediate stage in an object's migration from the disc to the inner Solar System. Eventually, perturbations from the giant planets send such objects towards the Sun, transforming them into periodic comets. Many Oort cloud objects are also thought to have originated in the scattered disc. Detached objects are not sharply distinct from scattered disc objects, and some such as Sedna have sometimes been considered {{to be included in}} this group.|$|E
5|$|This {{artificial}} lake {{is connected to}} {{the east side of the}} Segaran Lake via a 380 meter long canal that runs east to west. The canal was about 20 meter wide and there are two bottlenecks that are thought to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> where a hanging bridge once stood. One of the bridge is now located in the street that connects the kraton complex of Magangan with the Kamandhungan Kidul. The layout of the bridge can still be recognized, although the bridge itself has gone. On the west side of the hanging bridge is a pier that was used by the sultan as his starting point for his journey to the Taman Sari pool on his royal vessel.|$|E
5|$|Comets {{are thought}} to have two {{separate}} points of origin in the Solar System. Short-period comets (those with orbits of up to 200years) are generally accepted to have emerged from either the Kuiper belt or the scattered disc, which are two linked flat discs of icy debris beyond Neptune's orbit at 30AU and jointly extending out beyond 100AU from the Sun. Long-period comets, such as comet Hale–Bopp, whose orbits last for thousands of years, {{are thought to}} originate in the Oort cloud. The orbits within the Kuiper belt are relatively stable, and so very few comets are thought to originate there. The scattered disc, however, is dynamically active, and is far more likely to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of origin for comets. Comets pass from the scattered disc into the realm of the outer planets, becoming what are known as centaurs. These centaurs are then sent farther inward to become the short-period comets.|$|E

5|$|There are sixty-four Tīrthas or Theerthams (holy water bodies) in {{and around}} Rameswaram. According to the Skanda Purana, twenty-four of them are important. Of the 24, 14 are {{in the form of}} tanks and wells within the precincts of the temple. Bathing in these tanks is a major aspect of the pilgrimage to Rameswaram and is {{considered}} equivalent to penance. Twenty-two of the tanks are within the Ramanathaswamy Temple. The foremost one is called Agni Theertham, the sea (Bay of Bengal). Jatayu, King of the Birds, who fought in vain with the demon-king Ravana to save Sita, is said to have fallen down at Jadayu Theertham as his wings were severed. Villoondi Theertham literally translates to 'buried bow', is located around 7 kilometres from the main temple on the way to Pamban. It is believed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> where Rama quenched the thirst of Sita by dipping the bow into the sea water. Other major holy bodies are Hanuman Theertham, Sugreeva Theertham and Lakshmana Theertham.|$|E
