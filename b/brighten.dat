5|$|As {{the comet}} {{approached}} the Sun, {{it continued to}} <b>brighten,</b> shining at 2ndmagnitude in February, and showing a growing pair of tails, the blue gas tail pointing straight away from the Sun and the yellowish dust tail curving away along its orbit. On March 9, a solar eclipse in China, Mongolia and eastern Siberia allowed observers there to see the comet in the daytime.

5|$|A {{white dwarf}} star in a close binary system can {{accumulate}} material from its companion until it ignites and blows off in a thermonuclear explosion, known as a nova. These stars generally <b>brighten</b> by 7 to 16 magnitudes. Nova Circini 1926, also known as X Circini, was observed at magnitude 6.5 on 3 September 1926, before fading and fluctuating between magnitudes 11.7 and 12.5, during 1928, and magnitude 13, in 1929. Nova Circini 1995 (BY Circini) reached an maximum apparent magnitude of 7.2 in January 1995. BW Circini is a low mass X-ray binary system, comprising a black hole of around 8 solar masses and a yellow G0III-G5III subgiant star. X-ray outbursts were recorded in 1987 and 1997, and possibly 1971–72.|$|E

That darkened area is flanked to both the ENE and WSW by similarly sized <b>brightened</b> areas. The previously darkened zones in south Adiri adjacent to Belet became <b>brightened</b> areas. The previously darkened region between Dolmed Montes and Notus Undae had by then also become <b>brightened</b> relative to its original, pre-cloudburst state. A larger <b>brightened</b> area west of Dolmed Montes extends for 250 km {{to the south of}} the Angmar Montes range and parallel to it. Along the eastern part of this study area there is a large <b>brightened</b> region located between Echoriath Montes and Gram Montes, east of the eastern lobe of Notus Undae.

The house for Henry Spencer was changed, {{in order to be}} closer to the ocean. The set for Chief Vick's office was also changed, and was repainted to <b>brighten</b> the scenes shot in it. Much of the episode was filmed on a sound stage, while several other scenes were filmed {{in the basement of the}} facility. Much of the installment was written to take place in Santa Barbara's Arlington Theater. Several of the episode's scenes were written by Franks while filming the pilot episode.|$|E

The Severnside CRP also installed plant displays in 2008, and in 2011 distributed leaflets advertising train services to local residents, in association with Bristol City Council and Passenger Focus. In January 2017 a group called Friends of Parson Street Railway Station was formed to lobby for improvements to facilities and services at the station.|$|E
5|$|The game {{needed a}} 32 megabit battery backed-up {{cartridge}} to work properly, and was expensive to produce. This factor deterred some publishers, alongside {{the fact that}} launching a new intellectual property was considered risky. WayForward {{tried to find a}} publisher for years, before Capcom eventually picked the game for release. Capcom, however, held back the release for months, during which the Game Boy Advance was released. It is rumored that the game had only one run of 20–25,000 copies. WayForward saw that the console's screen had a tendency to darken the colours, so they took back the game and made further developments on it, incorporating a feature to <b>brighten</b> the screen if played on a Game Boy Advance, alongside some bonus features.|$|E

The proposed sale was expected to help the company repair its fundamental business structures and continue working to close the gap with McDonald's. Analysts commenting on the transaction stated that 3G will have to invest heavily in the company to help reverse its fortunes. David Palmer from UBS stated the company will need to work with its large group of franchise owners to <b>brighten</b> its locations and stabilize sales which could take several years and require significant reinvestment, while Steve West of Stifel Nicolaus stated that Burger King will need at least a year to right its fundamentals.|$|E
5|$|At Tabata's suggestion, Naora {{expanded}} the color palette {{to increase the}} game's realism and tie in with XVs art style. The original idea was to change the original red hue to a golden one to match the redone logo, but the graphics looked too dark on the large screen even with the adjustment, so blue tones were added to <b>brighten</b> up the scenery. Additional bass sounds {{were added to the}} sound effects, as the original platform's speaker system had previously limited the range and strength of sounds. The original camera behavior needed to be developed from scratch, as the camera angles used in the original looked out of place on the large screen. During the run-up to release, the team made modifications to the camera after receiving negative comments during demonstrations, addressing scenery collisions and the visibility of player and enemy characters during active gameplay. Because of these modifications, character speed and movement could be increased and improved. By December 2014, the game was in its final stages of development and undergoing debugging.|$|E
5|$|The video follows Ciara as {{she goes}} clubbing. The clip begins with the singer waking up at midnight, in a black, {{reflective}} apartment, as she is dressed in black and proceeds to leave through the building's fire escape. When she arrives outside, {{the windows of the}} building <b>brighten</b> and fade, and the moon, stars, and lamp posts create a strobe effect. White reflectors on the street sweep around Ciara and she is surrounded by dancers, many of whom are from the film, as they ascend a dark staircase and enter the club. When everyone arrives on the roof, Ciara meets up with Chamillionaire for his verse, and thereafter Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan, the stars of Step Up, make appearances in dance sequences. The lights of the cityscape begin to pulse to the music, and rain falls on the crowd. Unilux strobes are used to highlight the rain.|$|E

However, given {{the small number of}} clear events, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the simultaneous <b>brightening</b> of IPT during the active period of SW. Furthermore, in most cases, {{it is difficult to determine}} the <b>brightening</b> timing with the present method because the rising time of the late <b>brightening</b> is unknown. We selected a few clear <b>brightening</b> pairs (as shown in Fig.  7); the time lag ranged from 10 to 15  h. Further investigation is necessary after revision of the present method.

5|$|Wine was {{commonly}} {{drunk and}} was also regarded as the most prestigious and healthy choice. According to Galen's dietetics it was considered hot and dry but these qualities were moderated when wine was watered down. Unlike water or beer, which were considered cold and moist, consumption of wine in moderation (especially red wine) was, among other things, believed to aid digestion, generate good blood and <b>brighten</b> the mood. The quality of wine differed considerably according to vintage, the type of grape and more importantly, the number of grape pressings. The first pressing was made into the finest and most expensive wines which were reserved for the upper classes. The second and third pressings were subsequently of lower quality and alcohol content. Common folk usually {{had to settle for}} a cheap white or rosé from a second or even third pressing, meaning that it could be consumed in quite generous amounts without leading to heavy intoxication. For the poorest (or the most pious), watered-down vinegar (similar to Ancient Roman posca) would often be the only available choice.|$|E

30|$|In contrast, {{different}} stages {{have been used}} to define substorm onsets in recent studies. The AIB (i.e., the original definition, Stage 1) is sometimes adopted to identify substorm onsets (e.g., Donovan et al. 2008). Poleward expansion (i.e., Stage 2) is instead adopted with (e.g., Mende et al. 2009) or without (e.g., McPherron 2016) the recognition that this and the original definition differ. Substorm onsets in GIs are usually identified by the sudden <b>brightening</b> (e.g., Frey et al. 2004; Liou 2010). In contrast, Morioka et al.

40|$|Abstract. After being plasma carburized, {{the surface}} of AISI 316 {{austenitic}} stainless steel {{was covered with a}} layer of compact black thin-film. The surface polishing treatment, electrochemical <b>brightening</b> was carried out to remove the black thin-film and renew the original color of the stainless steel. The surface appearance, microstructures, micro hardness, surface roughness and corrosion resistance of the samples treated by electrochemical <b>brightening</b> process were analyzed. Experimental results show that the electrochemical <b>brightening</b> treatment can remove the black thin-film from and restore the original color of the plasma carburized stainless steel. After electrochemical <b>brightening</b> treatment, the thickness and surface hardness of the carburized layer were all decreased little, but the corrosion resistance was improved significantly. And the surface roughness (Ra) was lower than before. Therefore, the electrochemical surface <b>brightening</b> treatment can be used to improve the surface quality of the austenitic stainless steel treated by plasma carburizing...|$|R

40|$|We show four auroral initial <b>brightening</b> {{events at}} {{substorm}} onsets focusing on fine structures and their longitudinal dynamics, which were observed by all-sky TV cameras (30 -Hz sampling) on January 2008, in Canada. For two initial brightenings {{started in the}} field of views of the cameras, we found that they started at longitudinal segments with a size of less than ~ 30 – 60 km. One <b>brightening</b> expanded with wavy structures and the other expanded as a straight arc. Although the two events had different structures, both <b>brightening</b> auroras expanded with an average speed of ~ 20 km/s in the first 10 s, and ~ 10 km/s in the following 10 s. The other two events show that <b>brightening</b> auroras developed with periodic structures, with longitudinal wavelengths of ~ 100 – 200 km. Assuming that the <b>brightening</b> auroras are mapped to the physical processes occurring in the plasma sheet, we found that the scale size (30 – 60 km) and the expanding speed (20 km/s) of <b>brightening</b> auroras correspond to the order of ion gyro radii (~ 500 – 1400 km) and Alfvén speed or fast ion-flow speed (~ 400 km/s), respectively, in the plasma sheet...|$|R
