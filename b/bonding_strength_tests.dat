In this study, <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> <b>tests</b> were performed according to the application rate and curing time of asphalt emulsion. Based on finding from this study, optimum application rates and curing times are proposed. METHODS: In order to investigate bonding characteristic of asphalt emulsion, tests were performed on both asphalt concrete pavement and portland concrete pavement. Also, asphalt emulsions were tested at the application rate of 0, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6, and 0. 8 ℓ/m 2 and at the curing time of 0, 0. 5, 1, 2, and 24 hours. Pull-off test and shear bonding strength test, which commonly used for bonding strength measurement of asphalt emulsion, were adopted for this study. To assess field performance under different testing condition, asphalt emulsions were applied to in-service pavement. Throughout coefficient of determination analysis between material index properties from asphalt emulsion and mechanical response from <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> <b>tests,</b> performance correlativity was analyzed. RESULTS: Test results show that optimum application rate for asphalt overlay on asphalt concrete pavement (AOA) and asphalt overlay on concrete pavement (AOC) was 0. 4 ~ 0. 5 ℓ/m 2 and 0. 3 ~ 0. 5 ℓ/m 2, respectively. According to the curing time increment, tensile strength and shear strength of AOC were increased to 22 ~ 44 % and 20 ~ 39 %, respectively. AOA case also show strength increment in tensile strength (42 %) and shear strength (9 %). We tested the applicability of tack coat materials at the field sites, and our findings demonstrated that the bonding (for D and E) and rapid curing (for B, C, and D, E) performances were superior than others.

40|$|Objectives: Worldwide <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> <b>tests</b> {{are used}} to {{evaluate}} bonding effectiveness of different adhesive techniques. The {{purpose of this study}} was to systematically collect these data to identify the primary parameters that affect the outcome of <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> <b>tests,</b> and to attempt to disclose trends in adhesive performance of the different adhesive approaches today available. Materials and Methods: 871 studies were identified by entering the search term ‘dentin <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> AND "published last 5 years"[Filter]’ in PubMed, and subsequently inserted in a custom-made database. Only studies containing data on the adhesion of several commercial adhesives to dentin were retained. Besides the actual <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> data (mean, SD, n and number of pre-testing failures), other relevant parameters were recorded with regard to the substrate bonded to, surface preparation, storage conditions, potential artificial ageing, alternative application techniques, type of composite used, and some specific test conditions. Results: Up to now, 328 studies have been evaluated and from 110 studies relevant data were extracted, yielding 961 individual <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> <b>tests.</b> A relatively simple statistical general linear model was generated to identify relevant parameters. The <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> used most often was the micro-tensile <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> (µTBS: 67 %), followed by the macro-shear (MSB: 18 %), micro-shear (µSB: 9 %), macro-tensile (MTB: 4 %) and push-out <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> (PoB: 2 %). For further analysis, the push-out <b>bond</b> <b>strengths</b> and the adhesives that had been tested in less than 3 studies were excluded. From the remaining data, 56 % involved any kind of experimental parameter as artificial aging, altered application techniques, etc. The actual <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> obtained was significantly affected by the type of test employed (on average 29. 2 and 18. 1 MPa for µTBS and MSB respectively, p< 0. 0001). Significant differences were also observed for the different adhesive classes (pooled data) : three-step etch&rinse (mean ± 95 % confidence interval: 36. 9 ± 5. 8, n= 44;), two-step etch&rinse (26. 3 ± 1. 7, n= 178), two-step self-etch (32. 3 ± 2, n= 163) and one-step self-etch adhesives (23. 6 ± 1. 4, n= 253).

The NiCoCrAlHfYSi (MCrAlHYS) coating, as the first layer, contained a large number of voids, globular porosities, and micro-cracks with a thickness of 40 - 50 μm, while the Al 2 O 3 · 13 %TiO 2 coating, as the second layer, presented a unique bimodal microstructure with a thickness of 70 - 80 μm.

40|$|Bioactive glass (BG) {{reactivity}} is {{the result}} of a special silicate structure, disrupted by the presence of alkali and earth-alkali metal ions. These glasses dissolve in body fluids and form a hydroxy-carbonated apatite (HCA) on their surface, which mimics the composition and structure of the mineral phase of bone. This feature, coupled with the release of biologically active ions, explains their excellent osseointegration. In the first part of this thesis, we investigated the effect of substituting strontium for calcium in a BG system based on SiO 2 -P 2 O 5 -Na 2 O-CaO. The reason for introducing strontium in a BG was driven by its strengthening effect on bone in the treatment of osteoporosis. The glass structure and physical properties were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and thermal analysis. Dissolution profiles and in vitro bioactivity of Sr-BG were investigated in Tris buffer and simulated body fluid by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy, XRD and FTIR. Glass cytotoxicity was assessed by culturing osteoblast-like cells (SaOs- 2) on Sr-BG discs for 14 days. It was found that substitution of Sr for Ca does not modify the Q 2 silicate structure of the glass, nor its orthophosphate environment. However, it expands and weakens the glass network, thus the glasses dissolved more rapidly with higher strontium content and formed more HCA. A live/dead cellular assay showed an increased cell proliferation for higher strontium containing glasses. Glass polyalkenoate cements (GPCs) also use the potential of reactive glasses to release multivalent cations, which cross-link the carboxylic groups of polyacid chains in aqueous solution to form a hard cement. GPCs do not shrink, do not have significant exotherm and have good adhesive properties. However, the use of commercial GPCs, based on fluoro-alumino-silicate glasses, has been limited to dentistry and minor surgery due to biocompatibility issues. Aluminium is known to have neurotoxic effect and inhibits remineralisation. The aim of the second part of this study was to investigate new glass compositions for the development of aluminium-free GPCs for orthopaedic applications. Sr-BG compositions were adapted for cement forming purpose by removing soda and including Mg 2 +, Zn 2 + and Fe 3 + to provide an alternative to Al 3 +. The selected cations are all naturally present in the body and can potentially enter into the glass network, mimicking the formation of Al- O-Si bonds present in conventional GPCs. The mechanical properties of the cements were assessed by performing compression and <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> <b>tests,</b> whereas their working (WT) and setting times were measured with an oscillating rheometer. Finally, cement cytotoxicity was evaluated by culturing SaOs- 2 cells on cement discs. It was established that only high zinc containing glasses lead to cements with suitable mechanical properties to be used as bone cements. WT was short but increased up to two minutes by using citric acid as a chelating agent. The high Zn release from the cements induced cytotoxicity and predominated over the potential positive effect of Sr on cells.

The quantitative 3 -point bending test {{conforming to}} DIN 13 914 was in force in Germany {{until it was}} substituted in 1996 by the qualitative tensile test conforming to DIN EN ISO 3336. Two types of resin teeth and a heat cured denture base resin were used. The <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> according to DIN 13 914 was tested with 161 specimens. Parameters of producing and testing were modified {{in accordance with the}} formulated questions. For the DIN EN ISO 3336 <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> a total number of 72 specimens was produced and tested without any modification, in accordance with the directions of DIN EN ISO 3336. All specimens were tested with a crosshead speed of 1 mm min- 1 until fracture occurred. Maximum forces [N] were recorded. The fracture lines were recorded and classified. U-test according to MANN-WHITNEY was used for statistics. The DIN 13 914 <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> was investigated concerning its sensitivity to flaws, its reproducibility, its validity and its discriminatory power. As sources of errors were taken into account inadmissible angles between the interface and the specimens cross section which emerge from inaccurate specimens manufacture as well as an off-centre load. The frequency of adhesive fractures and hence the validity decreased in relation to the increase in angle. Off-centre positioning partly caused distortion of measurements. Thus, the DIN 13 914 <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> is fault-prone in terms of improper specimen production and during implementation. Yet faults are widely avoidable by simple easures. Reproducibility was investigated by means of influence exerted by the parameters of specimens production, which are poorly defined by DIN 13 914. These parameters are the specimens cross section size, the extent of milling, which means the amount of resin to be removed when roughening the base of the teeth and the type of hard metal milling cutter which has to be used for it. Since variations of these parameters showed no influence on test results, a good reproducibility is to be expected. It has been proved that the high rate of adhesive fractures is an expression of high validity. Exactly if the fracture occurs at least partly adhesive, which means that the fracture line follows at least partly the interface, the <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> affects the result and a valid measurement has to be assumed. So, the validity of each single measurement can be verified by a simple visual inspection of the fracture line. Thus, single measurements, which are recognized as not valid due to total cohesive fracture, can be eliminated. In this way the validity of the entire test method can be improved. The discriminatory power of DIN 13 914 <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> was sufficient to reveal the different bond properties of the two types of resin teeth. The <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> according to DIN EN ISO 3336 was investigated concerning its validity and its discriminatory power. It has been proved that the low rate of adhesive fractures is an expression of deficient validity. The test design induces cohesive fractures by determining the location of a fracture {{in the area of the}} weak incisal part of the tooth, which is some distance from interface that is to be tested. Thus bond testing according to DIN EN ISO 3336 has an inherent and serious methodical flaw. It measures <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> in relation to the strength of the incisal part of the tooth, while the latter remains unknown because a <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> of the tooth itself is not part of DIN EN ISO 3336. This fact causes a success of a tested tooth product, because its incisal parts are very weak or a failure of a tested tooth product, because its incisal parts are very strong. The discriminatory power of DIN EN ISO 3336 <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> was not sufficient to reveal the different bond properties of two types of resin teeth. Apart from expense, the DIN 13 914 testing method is clearly superior to the DIN EN ISO 3336 testing method in every respect. The substitution of the DIN 13 914 by the DIN EN ISO 3336 should be reversed in view of the shortcomings of the latter, which makes an appropriate quality assurance difficult to achieve...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the micro tensile <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> of a self-etch adhesive system following 1 year storage in water. Materials and Methods: 10 sound human molar teeth were used for micro tensile <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test.</b> Twostep self-etch dentin adhesive (Clearfil SE Bond®) was applied to the flat dentin surfaces according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Composite blocks (Z- 250; 3 M ESPE) of 5 mm in height have been prepared by using layering technique. Teeth were stored in water for 24 hours at 37 °C and longitudinally sectioned to obtain dentin sticks of 1 mm 2. Randomly selected samples from half of the teeth were immediately subjected to micro tensile test and. Remaining specimens were tested after 1 year storage in water. <b>Bond</b> <b>strengths</b> were calculated in megapascal (MPa). Results: Means and standard deviations of the Clearfil SE Bond® micro tensile <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> values were, respectively, 37. 31 ± 13. 77 MPa and 24. 78 ± 2. 99 MPa after 24 h and 1 year of storage in water. The difference was statistically significant (p= 0. 031). Conclusion: Long-term storage in water decreased the micro tensile <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> values of the twostep self-etch adhesive which has been accepted as the gold standard in <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{systematically}} review the available literature regarding in-vitro orthodontic shear <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> <b>testing</b> and to analyze the influence of <b>test</b> conditions on <b>bond</b> <b>strength.</b> Methods: Our data sources were Embase and Medline. Relevant studies were selected based on predefined criteria. Study test conditions that might influence in-vitro <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> were independently assessed by 2 observers. Studies reporting a minimum number of test conditions were included for meta-analysis by using a multilevel model with 3 levels, with author as the highest level, study as the second level, and specimens in the study as the lowest level. The primary outcome measure was <b>bond</b> <b>strength.</b> Results: We identified 121 relevant studies, of which 24 were included in the meta-analysis. Methodologic drawbacks of the excluded studies were generally related to inadequate reporting of test conditions and specimen storage. The meta-analysis demonstrated that 3 experimental conditions significantly affect in-vitro <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> <b>testing.</b> Although water storage decreased <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> on average by 10. 7 MPa, each second of photopolymerization time and each millimeter per minute of greater crosshead speed increased <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> by 0. 077 and 1. 3 MPa, respectively. Conclusions: Many studies on in-vitro orthodontic <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> fail to report test conditions that could significantly affect their outcomes.
