40|$|Abstract. Thermal {{spraying}} {{technologies are}} {{an effective way}} to ensure surface protection against destructive effects of wear, corrosion and oxidizing phenomena which can be applied in majority industrial sectors for improving properties of new parts or for reconditioning worn out parts technology. The powders used in this study are mainly used in the repair of cast iron parts (e. g. engine blocks) and in build- up of press tools for car <b>bodies,</b> <b>threads,</b> turbine-guided vanes, rotating valves and shafts in eccentric presses. Three types of tubular composites based on WC powders were studied which demonstrated that this technology improved their properties...|$|R

50|$|The {{peculiar}} {{characteristic of}} the saree is joining the body warp with the pallu warp which is locally called as TOPE TENI. This technique is only used exclusively at Ilkal. If anyone requires Ilkal saree one must prepare a warp for every saree. Warp <b>threads</b> for <b>body</b> is prepared separately. Similarly pallu warp is prepared separately either with art silk or pure silk depending upon the quality required. Thirdly border portion of warp is prepared as like the pallu warp either art silk or pure silk and the colour used for pallu and on border will be one and the same. In general, {{the length of the}} pallu will range 16” to 27”. The pallu <b>threads</b> and <b>body</b> <b>threads</b> are joined in loop technique, a typical method which is locally called as TOPE TENI.|$|R

40|$|Ballet {{and modern}} dance {{teachers}} often exhort students to ‘travel across the floor’ and ‘cover ground’. These instructions invoke metaphors {{of travel and}} mobility that capture an array of common assumptions about dance, space and movement. This essay examines the spatial and mobility discourses that these instructions simultaneously build upon and produce while exploring the seductiveness of technique’s promise of mastering space through the moving <b>body.</b> <b>Threading</b> auto-ethnography with critical theory and moving across different disciplinary fields and writing styles, I explore {{the ways in which}} these instructions leak outside the perimeter of the dance studio to feed into the narrative of a dancer’s extended physical, geographical and social mobility. Analysing the mobility and travel discourses of my dance training vis-à-vis poststructuralist theorizations of the subaltern power of the nomad and theories of space and place, I argue that this narrative becomes complicit in the construction of an idealized notion of artistic nomadism, which, in turn, aligns with current neoliberal logics organised around the production of mobile subjects...|$|R

50|$|The bonnet {{provides}} a leakproof closure for the valve <b>body.</b> The <b>threaded</b> {{section of the}} stem goes through a hole with matching threads in the bonnet. Globe valves may have a screw-in, union, or bolted bonnet. Screw-in bonnet is the simplest bonnet, offering a durable, pressure-tight seal. Union bonnet is suitable for applications requiring frequent inspection or cleaning. It also gives the body added strength. A bonnet attached with bolts is used for larger or higher pressure applications. The bonnet also contains the packing, a wearable material that maintains the seal between the bonnet and the stem during valve cycling.|$|R

5000|$|With {{respect to}} shape, stud bolts a.k.a studs are {{categorized}} into 3 basic types: [...] "Fully Threaded Stud Bolts", [...] "Tap End Stud Bolts", and [...] "Double End Stud Bolts". Each of these studs have different application. As name suggests, fully threaded studs have full <b>body</b> coverage with <b>threads</b> for full engagement of the matings nuts or similar parts. Tap end studs have threads at extreme {{ends of the}} <b>body</b> with unequal <b>thread</b> engagement length, while double end stud bolts have equal thread length at both ends. Apart from these there are stud bolts for flanges which are fully threaded studs with chamfered ends, and double end studs with reduced shank for special bolting applications.For studs that are not completely threaded, {{there are two types}} of studs: full-bodied studs, and undercut studs. Full-bodied studs have a shank equal to the major diameter of the thread. Undercut studs have a shank equal to the pitch diameter of the screw thread. Undercut studs are designed to better distribute axial stresses. In a full-bodied stud the stresses are greater in the threads than in the shank.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction Iatrogenic {{inferior}} hypogastric plexus neuropathy is a well-reported {{side effect}} of rectal prolapse surgery. This case report {{emphasizes the importance of}} careful evaluation of surgical strategy in pelvic surgery. Case presentation A 60 -year-old Swiss Caucasian woman developed disabling pelvic pain in the right iliac fossa, radiating to the upper posterior side of the right thigh and right labium majus characterized by electric feelings. This followed resection and bilateral rectal fixation to the sacral promontory as treatment for rectal prolapse. Investigations included a multidisciplinary neurological pain evaluation. A computed tomography scan did not reveal any cause. Revision surgery was performed and a foreign <b>body,</b> a <b>thread,</b> was found wrapped around the inferior hypogastric plexus and was removed. Four years later, the patient remains asymptomatic. Conclusion This case emphasizes the importance of careful identification of the inferior hypogastric plexus during primary pelvic surgery. </p...|$|R

We have reviewed 242 of the 270 studies published until June 2005 that mentioned immunohistochemistry for anti-alpha synuclein on human tissue {{and we found that}} only 75 (31 %) used commercial antibodies. We also noted that protocols, particularly dilution and antigen unmasking, varied between studies, even when the same antibody was employed. In order to establish a standardised protocol for alpha-synuclein immunohistochemistry, which can be applied in diagnostic neuropathology we tested seven commercial monoclonal antibodies in brains of subjects with Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, multiple sclerosis with incidental Lewy bodies and aged-matched normal brain and determined for each antibody the best suited protocol for antigen unmasking. We evaluated the intensity of immunolabelling in Lewy <b>bodies,</b> neuropil <b>threads,</b> dendrites, pre-synaptic terminals, granular cytoplasmic positivity, peri-axonal positivity, glial inclusions and non-specific immunolabelling.

50|$|The {{complete}} {{high explosive}} (HE) round {{consists of a}} fuze, the shell body, and the propellant charge assembly. The fuze is a point-detonating type, consisting of a two-piece brass body, a booster cup, a detonator holder, and a washer. The steel shell <b>body</b> is <b>threaded</b> at the top to receive the fuze assembly, and at the bottom to accommodate the propellant charge assembly. It is marked with a white band near the base, indicating {{the body of the}} shell is made of high grade steel and a red band at the nose, indicating it is filled with black powder. The propellant charge assembly consists of the percussion cap, the propellant powder, and an expanding copper rotating band. The propellant charge is ignited when the firing pin hits the percussion cap. The propellant gases expand the copper rotating band against the rifling in the interior of the barrel; the rifling causes the projectile to rotate and thus increases the accuracy of its flight. The projectile is 8.62 in long and 2.18 in inches in diameter; the complete round weighs 4 lb. The 70mm mortar was also used to launch an unusual AA mine discharger shell.|$|R

40|$|As {{processors}} {{continue to}} provide more and more parallelism, compilers have to keep up to identify operations that can execute independently, e. g. by exploiting program properties like independent loop iterations or independent operations. Lately, various researchers have identified value locality as a potentially interesting program property: many operations produce predictable values for each execution of a program. We are interested in taking advantage of this property when compiling for a processor with thread-level parallelism. The key idea is to use predictable values to relax dependence constraints: either possible memory conflicts that rarely occur or true register dependences whose values are highly predictable. In this paper we describe our approach and present preliminary results for a partitioner that uses value profiling to group the operations of a loop <b>body</b> into independent <b>threads</b> for parallel execution...|$|R
