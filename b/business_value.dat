However, only 31% of businesses surveyed engaged their employees on the company's CSR objectives and initiatives.

The expansion of sustainable business opportunities can contribute to job creation through the introduction of green-collar workers. [...] Research focusing on progressive corporate leaders who have integrated sustainability into commercial strategy has yielded a leadership competency model for sustainability, and led to emergence of the concept of [...] "embedded sustainability"—defined by its authors Chris Laszlo and Nadya Zhexembayeva as [...] "incorporation of environmental, health, and social value into the core business with no trade-off in price or quality—in other words, with no social or green premium". Laszlo and Zhexembayeva's research showed that embedded sustainability offers at least seven distinct opportunities for <b>business</b> <b>value</b> creation: a) better risk-management, b) increased efficiency through reduced waste and resource use, c) better product differentiation, d) new market entrances, e) enhanced brand and reputation, f) greater opportunity to influence industry standards, and g) greater opportunity for radical innovation.

Normally, equity interests in these firms (which include corporations, partnerships, limited-liability companies, and some other organizational forms) are traded privately, and often irregularly. As a result, previous transactions provide limited evidence as to the current value of a private company primarily because <b>business</b> <b>value</b> changes over time, and the share price is associated with considerable uncertainty due to limited market exposure and high transaction costs.|$|E
