50|$|Grooved ware pots {{excavated}} at Balfarg in Fife {{have been}} chemically analysed {{to determine their}} contents. It appears {{that some of the}} vessels there may have been used to hold <b>black</b> <b>henbane</b> (Hyoscyamus niger) which is a poison and a powerful hallucinogen.|$|E
50|$|The {{alkaloids}} {{content in}} plants is usually {{within a few}} percent and is inhomogeneous over the plant tissues. Depending {{on the type of}} plants, the maximum concentration is observed in the leaves (<b>black</b> <b>henbane),</b> fruits or seeds (Strychnine tree), root (Rauwolfia serpentina) or bark (cinchona). Furthermore, different tissues of the same plants may contain different alkaloids.|$|E

(Latin for [...] "black") {{occurs in}} Latinate {{scientific}} nomenclature {{and is the}} root word for some homophones of nigger; sellers of niger seed (used as bird feed), sometimes use the spelling Nyjer seed. The classical Latin pronunciation [...] sounds like the English , occurring in biologic and anatomic names, such as Hyoscyamus niger (<b>black</b> <b>henbane),</b> and even for animals {{that are not in}} fact black, such as Sciurus niger (fox squirrel).|$|E
50|$|Atropa baetica {{is one of}} {{the food}} plants of the larva of the Noctuid moth Heliothis peltigera Schiff. However, the {{toxicity}} of the leaves before the onset of senescence is such that the moth imagoes can display developmental abnormalities resulting from larval consumption of the plant e.g. deformities of the wings. The common name of H. peltigera in German (Bilsenkraut-Blüteneule) translates as 'the henbane-blossom owl (moth)', revealing the species' penchant for another plant in the Hyoscyameae - namely Hyoscyamus niger, <b>black</b> <b>henbane</b> - the chemistry of which {{is similar to that of}} Atropa baetica.|$|E
50|$|Within the 64.9 m {{diameter}} henge {{were found}} broken Neolithic pottery, burnt wood and bone {{which had been}} dumped on the site prior to the erection of a 25 m wide timber circle of 16 wooden posts. Two especially large portal timbers stood {{on the west side}} of the circle. It is likely that the henge was built after these phases of activity. Grooved ware pottery found in the postholes dates to around 2900 BC. Some of the vessels may have been used to hold <b>black</b> <b>henbane</b> (Hyoscyamus niger) which is a poison but also a powerful hallucinogen.|$|E
5000|$|Tropanes: The term [...] "tropane" [...] {{comes from}} a genus {{in which they are}} found, Atropa (the {{belladonna}} genus). Atropa is named after the Greek Fate, Atropos, who cut the thread of life. This nomenclature reflects its toxicity and lethality. They are bicyclic organic nitrogen compounds (IUPAC nomenclature: 8-Methyl-8-azabicyclo3.2.1octane), with the chemical formula of C8H15N. These alkaloids include, among others, atropine, cocaine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine. They are found in various species, such as mandrake (Mandragora autumnalis), <b>black</b> <b>henbane</b> or stinking nightshade (Hyoscyamus niger), belladonna (Atropa belladonna) the stramonium (Datura stramonium) and Brugmansia species, as well as many others in the Solanaceae family. Pharmacologically, they are the most powerful known anticholinergics in existence, meaning they inhibit the neurological signals transmitted by the endogenous neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. More commonly, they can halt many types of allergic reactions. Symptoms of overdose may include dry mouth, dilated pupils, ataxia, urinary retention, hallucinations, convulsions, coma, and death. Atropine, a commonly used ophthalmological agent, dilates the pupils and thus facilitates examination of the interior of the eye. In fact, juice from the berries of A. belladonna were used by Italian courtesans during the Renaissance to exaggerate the size of their eyes by causing the dilation of their pupils. Despite the extreme toxicity of the tropanes, they are useful drugs when administered in extremely small dosages. They can reverse cholinergic poisoning, which can be caused by overexposure to organophosphate insecticides and chemical warfare agents such as sarin and VX. Scopolamine (found in Hyoscyamus muticus and Scopolia atropioides), is used as an antiemetic against motion sickness or for people suffering from nausea as a result of receiving chemotherapy. Scopolamine and hyoscyamine are the most widely used tropane alkaloids in pharmacology and medicine due to their effects on the parasympathetic nervous system. Atropine has a stimulant effect on the central nervous system and heart, whereas scopolamine has a sedative effect. These alkaloids cannot be substituted by any other class of compounds, so they are still in demand. This {{is one of the reasons}} for the development of an active field of research into the metabolism of the alkaloids, the enzymes involved, and the genes that produce them. Hyoscyamine 6-β hydroxylase, for example, catalyses the hydroxylation of hyoscyamine that leads to the production of scopolamine at the end of the tropane’s biosynthetic pathway. This enzyme has been isolated and the corresponding gene cloned from three species: H. niger, A. belladonna and [...] B. candida.|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} germination and emergence {{characteristics of}} <b>black</b> <b>henbane,</b> ground cherry and curly dock a laboratory experiment, based on randomized complete block design with four replications, {{was carried out}} at the Faculty of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad in 2012. Treatments were temperature ranges (5 / 15, 10 / 20, 15 / 25, 15 / 30 and 20 / 35 ° C night / day) and different levels of salinity (0, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 and 320 mM of NaCl). The effect of pH adjusted to 5 - 9 by using acid buffer solution. Seeds were planted at different depth (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 cm) to study their effects on seedling emergence. Results showed that <b>black</b> <b>henbane</b> exhibited highest germination percentage at 25 / 15 diurnal tempratures, with 86. 50 and 60. 50 respectivly for daylight and complete darkness. Germination of ground cherry was highest (93 %) at 10 / 20 diurnal temprature and 41 % in complete darkness. Highest germination percentage for curly dock at diurnal temperatures of 20 / 10, 25 / 15 and 30 / 20 with light / dark regime of constant darkness was abserved. The seeds at diurnal temprature of 35 / 25 in both light regimes did not germinate. Increasing salinity reduced germination. Increasing the osmotic potential, also reduced germination significantly. Highest germination percentage of <b>black</b> <b>henbane</b> (97 %) was observed at pH 7, and lowest germination (17 %) at pH 9. Increasing planting depth reduced seedling emergence significantly. Germination percentages of ground cherry and curly dock at pH 6 and 7 were highest (97 % and 96 % respectively) and lowest 26 and 25 % respectively at pH 9...|$|E
40|$|Hyoscyamus Niger (HN) is a {{very common}} and highly hallucinogenic plant which {{contains}} anticholinergic agents. The HN is found in every region in Turkey. It is 25 - 80 cm tall with yellowish, purple flowers. As an annual herbaceous plant, it opens up with a lid-like cover when it is ripe and contains many seeds in its fruits. HN {{is commonly known as}} "stinking nightshade " or "black henbane; " in Turkey, HN is defined as "Ban Plant " (Ban Otu) or "Crazy Bat " (Deli Bat). There are 6 different types of henbane in Turkey. <b>Black</b> <b>henbane</b> and maize henbane are the kinds used in medicine. Maize henbane grows in and around Malatya in Turkey.

40|$|SummaryTropane {{alkaloids}} {{are valuable}} pharmaceutical drugs derived from solanaceous {{plants such as}} Hyoscyamus niger (<b>black</b> <b>henbane).</b> The biosynthesis of these molecules, including {{the nature of the}} enigmatic rearrangement of (R) -littorine to (S) -hyoscyamine, is not completely understood. To test the hypothesis that a cytochrome P 450 enzyme is involved in this rearrangement, we used virus-induced gene silencing to silence a cytochrome P 450, CYP 80 F 1, identified from H. niger roots by EST sequencing. Silencing CYP 80 F 1 resulted in reduced hyoscyamine levels and the accumulation of littorine. Hyoscyamine was observed in CYP 80 F 1 -expressing tobacco hairy roots supplied with (R) -littorine. Expression in yeast confirmed that CYP 80 F 1 catalyzes the oxidation of (R) -littorine with rearrangement to form hyoscyamine aldehyde, a putative precursor to hyoscyamine, and without rearrangement to form 3 ′-hydroxylittorine. Our data strongly support the involvement of CYP 80 F 1 in the rearrangement of littorine to hyoscyamine...|$|E
40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>henbane</b> (BH) or Hyoscyamus niger, {{has been}} used as a {{medicine}} since last centuries and has been described in all traditional medicines. It applies as a herbal medicine, but may induce intoxication accidentally or intentionally. All part of BH including leaves, seeds and roots contain some alkaloids such as Hyoscyamine, Atropine, Tropane and Scopolamine. BH has pharmacological effects like bronchodilating, antisecretory, urinary bladder relaxant, spasmolytic, hypnotic, hallucinogenic, pupil dilating, sedative and anti-diarrheal properties. Clinical manifestations of acute BH poisoning are very wide which include mydriasis, tachycardia, arrhythmia, agitation, convulsion and coma, dry mouth, thirst, slurred speech, difficulty speaking, dysphagia, warm flushed skin, pyrexia, nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision and photophobia, urinary retention, distension of the bladder, drowsiness, hyper reflexia, auditory, visual or tactile hallucinations, confusion, disorientation, delirium, aggressiveness, and combative behavior. The main treatment of BH intoxicated patients is supportive therapies including gastric emptying (not by Ipecac), administration of activated charcoal and benzodiazepines. Health care providers and physicians particularly emergency physicians and clinical toxicologists should know the nature, medical uses, clinical features, diagnosis and management of BH poisoning...|$|E
