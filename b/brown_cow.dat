5|$|Hirst {{was born}} on 7 September 1871 in the <b>Brown</b> <b>Cow</b> Inn, Kirkheaton, a village close to Huddersfield. He {{was the last of}} 10 {{children}} born to James Hirst and his wife Sarah Maria Woolhouse. When his father died in 1880, Hirst lived with his sister Mary Elizabeth Woolhouse and her husband John Berry in Kirkheaton. After leaving school at 10 years of age, Hirst first worked for a hand-loom weaver in a local cottage, and then at a dyeing firm. He played rugby football as a full back during winter, and cricket with his friends and brothers in summer. By the age of 15, Hirst was playing regularly for the Kirkheaton cricket team and his batting and bowling performances regularly won prizes from a local newspaper. His reputation grew; when he was 18 he was a key player in the Kirkheaton team which won the Lumb Challenge Cup of 1889. In the final, watched by players from Yorkshire County Cricket Club, he took five wickets for 23 runs. Days later, invited to take part along with another local player, he appeared for Yorkshire against Cheshire in a non-first-class match in Huddersfield. He scored six runs in his only innings, and took three wickets in the match.|$|E
500|$|St Mary's Lodge {{was built}} around 1470 as an {{addition}} to the late 12th-century buildings that formed the gatehouse at the main entrance to the abbey, – now the Marygate entrance to the gardens. Some remains of the 12th-century gatehouse can still be seen, in particular the archway attached {{to the side of}} the lodge. [...] The lodge is built of stone, and does not contain timber framing like the nearby Hospitium. [...] The lodge, along with the attached railings, gates and gate piers are all Grade I listed buildings, which means that they are of outstanding interest. [...] Originally, the lodge may have been used as a guesthouse for the abbey, and was the point where the poor could claim alms from the abbey. After the abbey's dissolution, the lodge became a courthouse until 1722, when part of the building became the <b>Brown</b> <b>Cow</b> pub. In 1840 John Philips, the Yorkshire Museum's curator, restored and converted it to use as his home while retaining its external appearance. [...] The lodge subsequently became used as offices, and during the early 21st century became the headquarters of the York Museums Trust.|$|E
2500|$|Williams played back-up behind Vince DiMaggio and Ivey Shiver on the (then) Pacific Coast League San Diego Padres. While in the Pacific Coast League in 1936, Williams met future {{teammates}} and friends Dom DiMaggio and Bobby Doerr, {{who were on}} the Pacific Coast League's San Francisco Seals. When Shiver announced he was quitting to become a football coach at the University of Georgia, the job, by default, was open for Williams. Williams posted a [...]271 batting average on 107 at bats in 42 games for the Padres in 1936. Unknown to Williams, he had caught the eye of the Boston Red Sox's general manager, Eddie Collins, while Collins was scouting Bobby Doerr and the shortstop George Myatt in August 1936. Collins later explained, [...] "It wasn't hard to find Ted Williams. He stood out like a <b>brown</b> <b>cow</b> in a field of white cows." [...] In the 1937 season, after graduating from Hoover High in the winter, Williams finally broke into the line-up on June 22, when he hit an inside-the-park home run to help the Padres win 3-2. The Padres ended up winning the PCL title, while Williams ended up hitting [...]291 with 23 home runs. Meanwhile, Collins kept in touch with Padres general manager Bill Lane, calling him two times throughout the season. In December 1937, during the winter meetings, the deal was made between Lane and Collins, sending Williams to the Boston Red Sox and giving Lane $35,000 and two major leaguers, Dom D'Allessandro and Al Niemiec, and two other minor leaguers.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the milk {{production}} dynamics in one dairy farm rearing both Brown andRomanian Spotted breed cows. The study was carried out at the Research and Development Station for BovineRaising Arad, on 321 lactations obtained from Romanian Spotted cows and 117 lactations from <b>Brown</b> <b>cows.</b> Theselactations were classified according to the age of cows in first, second, third, fourth and fifth lactation. The milk yieldin the first lactation was the lowest both in Romanian Spotted and <b>Brown</b> <b>cows</b> (5745. 86 kg and 7117. 00 kg,respectively), while the maximum milk yield per lactation was produced in the fourth lactation by the RomanianSpotted cows (6692. 81 kg) and in the fifth lactation by <b>Brown</b> <b>cows</b> (7898. 19 kg). Romanian Spotted cows produced 85. 85 % milk in the first lactation from the maximum lactation, while the <b>Brown</b> <b>cows</b> produced 90. 11 % in the firstlactation from the highest lactation. There was concluded that there are differences regarding the precocity for milkproduction and the dynamics from one lactation to another between the two breeds...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} two different cooling systems on production, physiological, and hormonal responses, 37 Holstein and 26 <b>Brown</b> Swiss dairy <b>cows</b> were allotted to three treatments. A control group of cows had access to only shade (C). A second group was cooled with spray and fan (S/F) and the third group was under an evaporative cooling system called Korral Kool&circR; (KK). The trial lasted from May to September with a daily maximum temperature-humidity index from 73 to 85. Milk production differences in Holstein cows were significantly increased by KK and S/F. No treatment differences in milk production were observed in <b>Brown</b> Swiss <b>cows.</b> Protein percentages were higher in C group compared to Korral Kool group only in <b>Brown</b> Swiss <b>cows,</b> while fat percentage were similar among treatments in Holstein cows. Rectal temperatures and respiration rates of the C group were higher than S/F and KK in both Holstein and <b>Brown</b> Swiss <b>cows.</b> Triiodothyronine levels in milk were significantly higher in KK group compared to S/F and C groups, while cortisol levels were lower in C group than S/F and KK. Similar differences were observed in body weight and body condition score changes between treatments in Holstein or <b>Brown</b> Swiss <b>cows.</b> Pregnancy rate was increased in the groups under the cooling systems in Holstein cows, however this effect was not observed in <b>Brown</b> Swiss <b>cows</b> where C group had a higher pregnancy rate than cooled groups. The cows under cooling systems spend more time eating {{and outside of the}} shade in the early afternoon (12 : 00 to 15 : 00) than control group. Cows injected with bST (bovine somatotropin) increased milk yield significantly only in <b>Brown</b> Swiss <b>cows,</b> whereas respiration rates were increased in both breeds by bST but rectal temperatures were similar between bST and non-bST cows. These results demonstrate that both cooling systems are an alternative to increase productive and reproductive performance and comfort of Holstein cows during summer in hot-dry climates.

40|$|Purpose: Bilateral {{convergent}} strabismus with exophthalmos (BCSE) is {{a widespread}} inherited eye defect in several cattle populations. Its progressive condition often leads to blindness in affected cattle and shortens their length of productive life. Furthermore, breeding with BCSE-affected animals is forbidden by the German animal welfare laws. We performed a mutation and association analysis for three candidate genes (troponin T type 1 [TNNT 1], retinol dehydrogenase 13 [RDH 13], and TCF 3 fusion partner [TFPT]), which are located within the previously identified BCSE-linked region on the telomeric end of bovine chromosome 18 (BTA 18). In addition, we developed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within these three candidate genes and nine other genes that are contained in this genomic BCSE-region to perform association analyses with BCSE in German Brown cattle. Methods: We performed cDNA analyses of all three candidate genes using eye tissues of three affected German <b>Brown</b> <b>cows</b> and three unaffected controls. Furthermore, we screened the exonic and the adjacent genomic sequences of RDH 13, TNNT 1, and TFPT using four BCSE-affected and four controls of German Brown cattle. Here, we included all exons of RDH 13 and those exons of TNNT 1 and TFPT for which SNPs were detected by cDNA analyses. In addition, we developed 21 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products for 17 more genes in the BCSE region and searched them for polymorphisms. All markers detected were genotyped in 48 BCSE-affected German <b>Brown</b> <b>cows</b> and 48 breed and sex matched controls and tested for association with BCSE...|$|R
