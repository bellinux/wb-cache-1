500|$|Two days later, on October 25, {{despite his}} reassurances days earlier, Lay {{dismissed}} Fastow from his position, citing [...] "In my continued {{discussions with the}} financial community, it <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO." [...] However, with Skilling and Fastow now both departed, some analysts feared that revealing the company's practices would be {{made all the more}} difficult.

500|$|Howarth {{said he had}} {{no desire}} to portray a {{redeemed}} Todd, and that the show would be better off finding [...] "a Todd who won't object to the material." [...] He subsequently left the series for a year. In the October 24, 1995 Soap Opera Digest issue, he stated:In the beginning, the character of Todd was successful. I'll always be proud of this story, because it {{was the result of a}} real team effort. It was one of those spectacular times when the writer, producer, director, grips, engineers and actors were all on the same wavelength. Everybody was working toward a common goal. My task, at the time, was to show the humanity of someone who was basically inhuman. Todd wasn't one-dimensional, but he was definitely a serious psychopath. Todd was a serial rapist. He raped Carol Swift. Then, he raped Marty Saybrooke, and that rape was brutal, intense, violent and realistic. There were innuendos he had raped other women before. He stalked Nora, he stalked and tried to rape Luna. [...] Linda Gottlieb told me with reasonable certainty that [...] would not try to redeem Todd. So, I didn't think the character would change. Then about a year ago, it <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> they were taking the character on a different path—they were redeeming him. In my mind, I'd been hired to play Todd Manning, a very realistic, serious psychopath. But now, the powers-that-be wanted me to play Todd Lord. And the story of Todd Lord is not realistic—it's a fairy tale. I thought, [...] "It would be best for the show if I were to leave." [...] That's when I tendered my resignation.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2005 interview, Heinze {{spoke of}} the {{creative}} frustration {{that led him to}} leave academia. [...] "Even though I was doing a lot of academic writing," [...] he said, [...] "I had this ceaseless, nagging feeling that I wasn't fulfilling myself creatively... I finally took the plunge into a real fiction project... it <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that creative rather than scholarly writing was my real métier." [...] He chose playwriting, in particular, because of Joe Orton; the intensity, intelligence and dark humor of Orton's plays had fascinated him. In 2006 he left his tenured Full Professorship at USF, moved to New York City, and embarked on a career in playwriting.|$|E

5000|$|In 2007, Powell was unopposed for {{his second}} {{legislative}} term. However, he soon resigned his seat even before he could be sworn into his second term.

2500|$|On 4 April 2011 Attorney General Eric Holder {{announced}} that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed {{and four other}} 9/11 terror suspects will face a military trial at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. In announcing his decision, Holder blasted Congress for imposing restrictions on the Justice Department's ability to bring the men to New York City for civilian trials. [...] "After thoroughly studying the case, it <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the best venue for prosecution was in federal court. I stand by that decision today," [...] Holder said. [...] "As the president has said, those unwise and unwarranted restrictions (imposed by Congress) undermine our counterterrorism efforts and could harm our national security. Decisions about who, where and how to prosecute have always been - and must remain - {{the responsibility of the}} executive branch." [...] Holder insisted, [...] "We were prepared to bring a powerful case against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his four co-conspirators - one of the most well-researched and documented cases I have ever seen in my decades of experience as a prosecutor." [...] He added, [...] "Had this case proceeded in Manhattan or in an alternative venue in the United States, as I seriously explored in the past year, I am confident that our justice system would have performed with the same distinction that has been its hallmark for over 200 years." [...] Holder had promised to seek the death penalty for each of the five men and on 4 April he warned that it is an [...] "open question" [...] if such a penalty can be imposed by a military commission if the defendants plead guilty.|$|E

These aspects of our role as science educators have been covered in recent years in my humble pages of this august journal, but what has <b>become</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> is a public misconception of our ocean. This is partly {{due to a lack of}} appreciation of its enormity and a misguided belief that humankind has everything under control...|$|R
40|$|At {{the outset}} I need to emphasise that my {{interest}} in MCDA (Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis) is primarily in its application to natural resource management decision-making.

Over time, it has <b>become</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that on the one hand, the field of MCDA provides a multitude of tools which can indeed address a wide array of problems, but, on the other, there are questions that need to be answered using other tools...|$|R
