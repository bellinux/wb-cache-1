5|$|Elmer {{recounts the}} initial violent {{backlash}} by humanity and how Ben hid {{the three of}} them from groups out to kill chickens. This is followed by retaliation against humans by chickens, chicken-rights groups, and eventually recognition of chickens as humans by the United Nations. During this time, Elmer becomes a syndicated columnist in a newspaper and writes about chicken-related topics, both light-hearted and serious. The peace between humans and chickens is disrupted in the late 1980s by an outbreak of bird flu. Millions of healthy chickens are killed by humans {{to prevent the spread of}} the disease, and Ben hides Elmer and Helen again. When others come for them, Ben intervenes and is accidentally shot protecting Elmer. Once the flu is contained, humanity expresses regret for its rash actions and Elmer writes a scathing editorial about the panic. His journal entries <b>become</b> <b>less</b> <b>frequent</b> after he and Helen have children.|$|E
5|$|The Hawaiian–Emperor {{seamount}} chain {{is a series}} of volcanoes and seamounts extending across the Pacific Ocean. The chain has been produced by the movement of the ocean crust over the Hawaii hotspot, an upwelling of hot rock from the Earth's mantle. As the oceanic crust moves the volcanoes farther away from their source of magma, their eruptions <b>become</b> <b>less</b> <b>frequent</b> and less powerful until they eventually cease to erupt altogether. At that point erosion of the volcano and subsidence of the seafloor cause the volcano to gradually diminish. As the volcano sinks and erodes, it first becomes an atoll island and then an atoll. Further subsidence causes the volcano to sink below the sea surface, becoming a seamount and/or a guyot. This list documents the most significant volcanoes in the chain, ordered by distance from the hotspot; however, there are many others that have yet to be properly studied.|$|E
5|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Turkey is characterised by achievements and challenges. Over the past decades access to drinking water {{has become almost}} universal and access to adequate sanitation has also increased substantially. Autonomous utilities have been created in the 16 metropolitan cities of Turkey and cost recovery has been increased, thus providing {{the basis for the}} sustainability of service provision. Intermittent supply, which was common in many cities, has <b>become</b> <b>less</b> <b>frequent.</b> In 2004, 61% of the wastewater collected through sewers was being treated. Remaining challenges include the need to further increase wastewater treatment, to reduce the high level of non-revenue water hovering around 50% and to expand access to adequate sanitation in rural areas. The investment required to comply with EU standards in the sector, especially in wastewater treatment, is estimated to be in the order of €2 billion per year, more than double the current level of investment.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} source of salty water are infrequent inflows of North Sea water into the Baltic. Such inflows, important to the Baltic ecosystem because of the oxygen they transport into the Baltic deeps, used to happen on average every {{four to five years}} until the 1980s. In recent decades they have <b>become</b> <b>less</b> <b>frequent.</b> The latest four occurred in 1983, 1993, 2003 and 2014 suggesting a new inter-inflow period of about ten years.|$|E
25|$|Since World War II, smoking has {{gradually}} <b>become</b> <b>less</b> <b>frequent</b> on screen as the obvious health hazards of smoking {{have become more}} widely known. With the anti-smoking movement gaining greater respect and influence, conscious attempts not to show smoking on screen are now undertaken {{in order to avoid}} encouraging smoking or giving it positive associations, particularly for family films. Smoking on screen is more common today among characters who are portrayed as anti-social or even criminal.|$|E

25|$|In 1934 she {{explored}} {{a variety}} of archaeological sites in the Peloponnese {{and other parts of}} mainland Greece, and returned to Crete in 1935. She continued to work in association with Pendlebury: in particular around Lasithi in central Crete. She excavated, helped publish, and also took opportunities to travel with Eccles. Some of her travel was to the Middle East and Egypt to explore links between Minoan and Oriental cultures. Although Arthur Evans' visits to Knossos had <b>become</b> <b>less</b> <b>frequent</b> in the 1930s, he knew enough about her work to give her the role of organising the Knossos section of a London exhibition celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the British School, and of helping with a further display at the Ashmolean. He also used one of her drawings of a hoard of axes to illustrate his last work on the palace at Knossos.|$|E
25|$|In Pakistan, stamp {{programmes}} are not {{issued in}} advance. Earlier, collectors could almost {{always count on}} stamps being issued {{on at least two}} dates: 23 March and 14 August. However, in recent years, the 23 March issues have <b>become</b> <b>less</b> <b>frequent.</b> The number of stamps issue per year also varies. However, no matter how many issues are released, their total cost rarely exceeds Rs. 300/- (approx USD 5). Besides postage stamps and souvenir sheets, the post office also sells first day covers, leaflets with and without stamps on it and postal stationery. Earlier, the post office did not use any specific numbering system but this changed when they started using a rather simple system on their leaflets: xxxx – y where xxxx is the year and y is the issue number within that year. All major catalogues include Pakistani stamps in them. Two local updated catalogues are available, each of which uses its own system of numbering.|$|E
25|$|The {{height of}} S.sempervirens is {{closely tied to}} fog availability; taller trees <b>become</b> <b>less</b> <b>frequent</b> as fog becomes less frequent. As S.sempervirens’ height increases, {{transporting}} water via water potential to the leaves becomes increasingly more difficult due to gravity. Despite the high rainfall that the region receives (up to 100cm), the leaves in the upper canopy are perpetually stressed for water. This water stress is exacerbated by long droughts in the summer. Water stress is believed to cause the morphological changes in the leaves, stimulating reduced leaf length and increased leaf succulence. To supplement their water needs, redwoods utilize frequent summer fog events. Fog water is absorbed through multiple pathways. Leaves directly take in fog from the surrounding air through the epidermal tissue, bypassing the xylem. Coast redwoods also absorb water directly through their bark. The uptake of water through leaves and bark repairs and reduces the severity of xylem embolisms, which occur when cavitations form in the xylem preventing the transport of water and nutrients. Fog may also collect on redwood leaves, drip to the forest floor, and be absorbed by the tree's roots. This fog drip may form 30% of the total water used by a tree in a year.|$|E

500|$|McCain {{acknowledges}} {{having said}} intemperate things in years past, though {{he also says}} that many stories have been exaggerated. One psychoanalytic comparison suggests that McCain was not the first presidential candidate to have a temper, and cultural critic Julia Keller argues that voters want leaders who are passionate, engaged, fiery, and feisty. McCain has employed both profanity and shouting on occasion, although such incidents have <b>become</b> <b>less</b> <b>frequent</b> over the years. Lieberman has made this observation: [...] "It {{is not the kind of}} anger that is a loss of control. He is a very controlled person." [...] Senator Thad Cochran, who has known McCain for decades and has battled him over earmarks, expressed concern about a McCain presidency: [...] "He is erratic. He is hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me." [...] Ultimately Cochran decided to support McCain for president, after it was clear he would win the nomination.|$|E
500|$|Information for {{offshore}} {{regions and}} warmer waters is more scarce, but widespread sightings indicate the killer whale can survive in most water temperatures. They have been sighted, though more infrequently, in the Mediterranean, the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean. Over 50 individual whales {{have been documented}} in the northern Indian Ocean, including two individuals that were sighted in the Persian Gulf in 2008 and off Sri Lanka in 2015. Those orcas may occasionally enter the Red Sea through the Gulf of Aden. The modern status of the species along coastal mainland China and its vicinity is unknown. Recorded sightings have been made from almost the entire shoreline. A wide-ranging population is likely {{to exist in the}} central Pacific, with some sightings off Hawaii. Distinct populations may also exist off the west coast of tropical Africa, and Papua New Guinea. In the Mediterranean, killer whales are considered [...] "visitors", likely from the North Atlantic, {{with the exception of one}} small population which lives in the Strait of Gibraltar. Sightings <b>become</b> <b>less</b> <b>frequent</b> further east. Killer whales also appear to regularly occur off the Galápagos Islands.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{praised the}} many subtle {{differences}} between the two universes, while others lauded Leonard Nimoy's appearance as William Bell and his scenes with Walter. Website blogger io9 listed both parts of [...] "Over There" [...] as one of the select few [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to understand the show, referring to it as [...] "one of the most epic season finales ever". Another io9 reviewer called the ending one of the [...] "best SF/fantasy cliffhangers ever shown on television" [...] in a September 2010 list. The finale helped propel Fringe onto a number of 2010 [...] "best of television" [...] lists, including Digital Spy, Entertainment Weekly, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, The Daily Beast, The New York Times, TV Squad, the New York Post, and IGN; the last of these named Fringe the best sci-fi series of 2010, beating fellow nominees Lost, Caprica, and Stargate Universe. Some critics predicted that, because of the increased focus on looking into the alternate universe and advancing its mythology, Fringes [...] "monster-of-the-week" [...] episodes would <b>become</b> <b>less</b> <b>frequent.</b> This could {{make it more difficult for}} casual viewers to follow the show in its third season.|$|E

2500|$|By late 2001, {{demonstrations in}} Tiananmen Square had <b>become</b> <b>less</b> <b>frequent,</b> and the {{practice}} was driven deeper underground. As public protest fell out of favor, practitioners established underground [...] "material sites," [...] which would produce literature and DVDs to counter the portrayal of Falun Gong in the official media. Practitioners then distribute these materials, often door-to-door. Falun Gong sources estimated in 2009 that over 200,000 such sites exist across China. The production, possession, or distribution of these materials is frequently grounds for security agents to incarcerate or sentence Falun Gong adherents.|$|E
2500|$|Tourism {{travel to}} the {{archipelago}} is severely limited. There is no infrastructure to support tourists {{and the only way}} to reach the islands is by icebreaker, typically operating out of Murmansk. In 2012 there were only eight successful landings on the islands. A contributing factor to the low utilization is the difficulty of obtaining permissions and frequent closing of the Kola Bay to accommodate military exercises. The most frequent service is a three-week North Pole tour with Russian nuclear-powered icebreaker 50 Let Pobedy, which stops by the islands en route. The most popular destinations are areas with bird cliffs and walrus colonies, such as Cape Flora on Northbrook Island and Cape Rubini on Hooker Island, as well as historical remains such as Nansen's hut on Jackson Island. Tourists are commonly landed by helicopter. [...] For purposes of amateur radio awards the islands count as a separate international [...] "entity". [...] Activity by operators has <b>become</b> <b>less</b> <b>frequent,</b> though does occasionally occur.|$|E

2500|$|Young {{domestic}} turkeys readily fly short distances, perch and roost. [...] These behaviours <b>become</b> <b>less</b> <b>frequent</b> as the birds mature, but adults will readily climb on {{objects such as}} bales of straw. Young birds perform spontaneous, frivolous running ('frolicking') which has all the appearance of play. Commercial turkeys show a wide diversity of behaviours including 'comfort' behaviours such as wing-flapping, feather ruffling, leg stretching and dust-bathing. Turkeys are highly social and become very distressed when isolated. [...] Many of their behaviours are socially facilitated i.e. expression of a behaviour by one animal increases the tendency for this behaviour to be performed by others. Adults can recognise 'strangers' and placing any alien turkey into an established group will almost certainly result in that individual being attacked, sometimes fatally. Turkeys are highly vocal, and 'social tension' within the group can be monitored by the birds’ vocalisations. A high-pitched trill indicates the birds are becoming aggressive which can develop into intense sparring where opponents leap {{at each other with}} the large, sharp talons, and try to peck or grasp the head of each other. [...] Aggression increases in frequency and severity as the birds mature.|$|E
