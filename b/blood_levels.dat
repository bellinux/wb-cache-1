The purpose of the study is to know the effect of VCO on glucose <b>blood</b> <b>level,</b> differential leucocytes count and creatinine <b>blood</b> <b>level</b> on hyperglycemic and normoglicemic ovalbumin sensitized mice. Forty five (45) male (mice) of Mus musculus Balb/c with average weight of 35 g are divided into 9 groups with 5 repetitions, those are 4 non alloxan groups and 5 alloxan induced hyperglycemic groups. On 22 nd day to 36 th day they are sensitize to ovalbumin as allergen.

The result of this study were that within differential leucocytes count of hyperglycemic mice, neutrophile percentage were much lower than the normal value (3. 22 %), and lymphocyte percentage were much higher than the normal value (94. 54 %).

5|$|Overdoses of {{ingested}} iron {{can cause}} excessive levels of free iron in the blood. High <b>blood</b> <b>levels</b> of free ferrous iron react with peroxides to produce highly reactive free radicals that can damage DNA, proteins, lipids, and other cellular components. Iron toxicity {{occurs when the}} cell contains free iron, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the availability of transferrin to bind the iron. Damage to {{the cells of the}} gastrointestinal tract can also prevent them from regulating iron absorption, leading to further increases in <b>blood</b> <b>levels.</b> Iron typically damages cells in the heart, liver and elsewhere, causing adverse effects that include coma, metabolic acidosis, shock, liver failure, coagulopathy, adult respiratory distress syndrome, long-term organ damage, and even death. Humans experience iron toxicity when the iron exceeds 20milligrams for every kilogram of body mass; 60milligrams per kilogram is considered a lethal dose. Overconsumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of ferrous sulfate tablets intended for adult consumption, {{is one of the most}} common toxicological causes of death in children under six.

40|$|Introduction: The {{extensive}} use of Lead has led to health problems including CNS, anemia and other occupational poisoning among workers. To determine the <b>blood</b> lead <b>levels</b> in relation to demographic factors, this study was carried out. Methods: In this cross sectional study, 490 workers at Kooshk Lead and Zinc mine were selected and blood samples were taken. The <b>blood</b> lead <b>levels</b> were assessed according to the NIOSH standard using atomic absorption. Results: The mean, minimum and maximum of <b>blood</b> lead <b>levels</b> were 49, 9 and 116 mg/dl, respectively. The <b>blood</b> lead <b>levels</b> in 45. 7 percent of workers was more than permissible limit. The <b>blood</b> lead <b>level</b> was not significantly related to age and history of work. The lowest and highest <b>levels</b> of <b>blood</b> lead were 9 & 116 mg/dl, respectively.

5|$|Chelation challenge, {{also known}} as {{provocation}} testing, is used to indicate an elevated and mobilizable body burden of heavy metals including lead. This testing involves collecting urine before and after administering a one-off dose of chelating agent to mobilize heavy metals into the urine. Then urine is analyzed by a laboratory for levels of heavy metals; from this analysis overall body burden is inferred. Chelation challenge mainly measures the burden of lead in soft tissues, though whether it accurately reflects long-term exposure or the amount of lead stored in bone remains controversial. Although the technique {{has been used to}} determine whether chelation therapy is indicated and to diagnose heavy metal exposure, some evidence does not support these uses as <b>blood</b> <b>levels</b> after chelation are not comparable to the reference range typically used to diagnose heavy metal poisoning. The single chelation dose could also redistribute the heavy metals to more sensitive areas such as central nervous system tissue.|$|E

As a result, {{this time of day}} is considered optimal for researchers studying stress and hormone levels. Plants generally have their highest photosynthetic levels of the day at noon and in the early afternoon, owing to the sun's high angle in the sky.
