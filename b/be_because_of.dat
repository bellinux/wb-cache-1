5|$|In some church {{records the}} town is {{referred}} to as 'Norton Canonicorum' as an alternative to Midsomer Norton, and this may <b>be</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the local Priory's link to Merton Priory in London until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1546.|$|E
5|$|C. c. coronoides, the {{nominate}} or eastern subspecies, {{is found}} across most of eastern Australia. Its range is also {{highly correlated with}} the presence of sheep. This is thought to <b>be</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the frequency of dead animals, which can be an important source of food. Ornithologist Ian Rowley held that the eastern subspecies was expanding eastwards before European colonisation, and that this suggested it was of younger origin than the western subspecies, which appears static. The advent of agriculture facilitated further spread.|$|E
5|$|In 793 the {{vulnerability}} of the English east coast was exposed when the monastery at Lindisfarne was looted by Vikings and a year later Jarrow was also attacked, events which Steven Plunkett reasons would ensure that the East Anglians were governed firmly. Æthelberht's claim to be a king descended from the Wuffingas dynasty (suggested by the use of a Roman she-wolf and the title REX on his coins) could <b>be</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> a need for strong kingship {{as a result of the}} Viking attacks.|$|E

5|$|Low immune {{function}} {{has also been}} implicated in endometrial cancer. High blood pressure is also a risk factor, but this may <b>be</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its association with obesity. Sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from endometrial cancer. The risk is not negated by regular exercise, though it is lowered.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the sites}} {{are located in the}} Highlands and Islands. This may <b>be</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the {{relatively}} sparse modern populations and consequent lack of disturbance. Much of the area also has a thick covering of peat that preserves stone fragments, although the associated acidic conditions tend to dissolve organic materials. There are also numerous important remains in the Orkney archipelago, where sand and arable land predominate. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures that may have helped to preserve their integrity.|$|E
5|$|No tornado watches or {{warnings}} {{were issued}} {{before the storm}} struck. This was later determined to <b>be</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> missing atmospheric sounding data, {{as well as an}} incorrect assessment of the height of the tropopause, which led to an underestimation of the strength of the thunderstorm which produced the tornado. Although a severe thunderstorm warning was issued at 2:57 pm, very few people received the warnings in time.|$|E
5000|$|The 1990 edition <b>was</b> {{abandoned}} <b>because</b> <b>of</b> snow. The 1995 edition <b>was</b> abandoned <b>because</b> <b>of</b> frost. The 2001 running {{took place}} at Newbury. The 2008 edition <b>was</b> abandoned <b>because</b> <b>of</b> heavy rain.|$|R

[...] Bernard {{wondered}} {{what she was going}} to say--if she were going to be silly enough to allude to the most impudent of fictions; then, as she stood opening and closing her blue fan and smiling at him in the fire-light, he felt that she was silly enough for anything.

5|$|Tarariki {{are found}} in the east of the North Island from East Cape to the Wairarapa. Māori valued the narrow spiky leaves as a source of {{particularly}} tough, durable fibre. Tarariki's strong leaf fibres may be an adaptation to the region's hot, dry summers. In parts of the Wairarapa, the trees are particularly spiky, with stiff leaves and partially rolled leaf-blades. The trees near East Cape, by contrast, have leaves that hang laxly on the tree. In Hawke's Bay, some trees have greener, broader leaves, and this may <b>be</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> wharanui characteristics brought in across the main divide through the Manawatu Gorge.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other whales (and {{most other}} mammals), the females {{are larger than}} the males. Sexual {{dimorphism}} is usually reversed, with the males being larger, but the females of all baleen whales are usually five percent larger than males. Sexual dimorphism is also displayed through whale song, notably in humpback whales where the males of the species sing elaborate songs. Male right whales have bigger callosities than female right whales. The males are generally more scarred than females which is thought to <b>be</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> aggression during mating season.|$|E
5|$|People {{receiving}} dimercaprol need to {{be assessed}} for peanut allergies since the commercial formulation contains peanut oil. Calcium EDTA is also effective if administered four hours after the administration of dimercaprol. Administering dimercaprol, DMSA (Succimer), or DMPS prior to calcium EDTA is necessary to prevent the redistribution of lead into the central nervous system. Dimercaprol used alone may also redistribute lead to the brain and testes. An adverse side effect of calcium EDTA is renal toxicity. Succimer (DMSA) is the preferred agent in mild to moderate lead poisoning cases. This {{may be the case}} in instances where children have a blood lead level >25μg/dL. The most reported adverse side effect for succimer is gastrointestinal disturbances. It is also important to note that chelation therapy only lowers blood lead levels and may not prevent the lead-induced cognitive problems associated with lower lead levels in tissue. This may <b>be</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the inability of these agents to remove sufficient amounts of lead from tissue or inability to reverse preexisting damage.|$|E

5|$|The CAB Rating for {{the show}} was 22.1% and placed 12th among the highest rated evening {{programs}} of the 1932–33 season. The CAB Rating was not disappointing – popular established shows such as The Shadow and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes did not perform as well – but {{it was less than}} half of Texaco's Fire Chief, which got a 44.8% CAB Rating and was the third highest-rated program of the season. One reason for the lower ratings may <b>be</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the time slot the show aired. In September 1932, only 40% of radio owners were listening to the radio at 7:00p.m., whereas 60% listened at 9:00p.m. The 1932–1933 season's top-rated shows, The Chase and Sanborn Hour, Jack Pearl's Baron Münchhausen, and Fire Chief all aired after 9:00p.m. Standard Oil decided it could not compete with Texaco in the ratings and Five-Star Theater was not renewed for a second season.|$|E
5|$|The use of interferon, which {{requires}} injections daily or thrice weekly, has been supplanted by long-acting PEGylated interferon, which is injected only once weekly. However, some individuals {{are much more}} likely to respond than others, and this might <b>be</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the genotype of the infecting virus or the person's heredity. The treatment reduces viral replication in the liver, thereby reducing the viral load (the amount of virus particles as measured in the blood). Response to treatment differs between the genotypes. Interferon treatment may produce an e antigen seroconversion rate of 37% in genotype A but only a 6% seroconversion in type D. Genotype B has similar seroconversion rates to type A while type C seroconverts only in 15% of cases. Sustained e antigen loss after treatment is ~45% in types A and B but only 25–30% in types C and D.|$|E

25|$|Spermatozoa may {{occasionally}} {{be found}} within the lumen of the glands, even though the vesicles are blind-ended in nature. This is thought to <b>be</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> slight reflux due to muscular contractions of the urethra during ejaculation.|$|E
25|$|As {{compared}} with apes, which have an elongated Pisiform, humans have a shorter pisiform bone. This {{is due to}} the loss of the single growth plate typically found in other mammalian pisiforms. This may <b>be</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> evolutionary benefits from having a shorter pisiform bone, including facilitating ulnar deviation of the hand, and preventing hyperextension of the wrist, actions that improve the action of clubbing.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacological {{responses}} to naturally occurring compounds in food, or chemical intolerance, {{can occur in}} individuals from both allergic and non-allergic family backgrounds. Symptoms may begin at any age, and may develop quickly or slowly. Triggers may range from a viral infection or illness to environmental chemical exposure. It occurs more commonly in women, which may <b>be</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> hormone differences, as many food chemicals mimic hormones.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{texts on}} Hatha yoga of the Naths, such as Vivekamartanda and Gorakhshasataka, are from Maharashtra, and these manuscripts are likely from the 13th century. These Nath texts, however, have an overlap with the 13th century Jnanadeva {{commentary on the}} Hindu scripture Bhagavada Gita, called the Jnanesvari. This may <b>be</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> mutual influence, as both the texts integrate the teachings of Yoga and Vedanta schools of Hinduism in a similar way.|$|E
25|$|In Finland, the Apollo {{was one of}} {{the first}} species of insects {{declared}} endangered. The Apollo population in Finland and Sweden decreased drastically during the 1950s. The reason for this is not known, but it is commonly thought to <b>be</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> a disease. In Sweden, it is now restricted to areas that have limestone in the ground, suggesting that the decrease could hypothetically be related to acid rain.|$|E
25|$|The Bay {{is mostly}} {{known for its}} seafood production, {{especially}} blue crabs, clams and oysters. In {{the middle of the}} 20th century, the Bay supported 9,000 full-time watermen, according to one account. Today, the body of water is less productive than it used to <b>be</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> runoff from urban areas (mostly on the Western Shore) and farms (especially on the Eastern Shore and in the Susquehanna River watershed), over-harvesting, and invasion of foreign species.|$|E
