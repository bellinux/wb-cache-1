50|$|As {{one might}} imagine, this makes <b>blitting</b> {{significantly}} slower than sprite manipulation. However, <b>blitting</b> has one very big advantage: {{there is no}} physical limit {{to the number of}} patterns you can blit, or {{to the size of the}} patterns. Thus you can use <b>blitting</b> to display anything on the screen, including simulating sprites (through the double-write pattern noted above), or even text.|$|E

50|$|The Toyota Mark II <b>Blit</b> was the {{replacement}} of the Toyota Mark II Qualis, and shared a platform with the Mark II rear wheel drive sedan. The Mark II Qualis was a rebadged (SXV20) Camry Gracia wagon, with front wheel drive. The <b>Blit</b> was introduced in January 2002. Production ended in June 2007 due to consolidation efforts. Toyota's official <b>Blit</b> successor was a front wheel drive minivan, the Mark X ZiO, from September, 2007. The <b>Blit</b> was a return to the Mark II platform with rear wheel drive with optional AWD and not a wagon version of the front wheel drive Camry. The <b>Blit</b> used straight-6 engines with an optional turbo that was discontinued May 2006. The engines used were the 2.0 L 1G-FE, 2.5 L 1JZ-FSE, 2.5 L 1JZ-GE, and 2.5 L turbocharged 1JZ-GTE.|$|R
50|$|Matthew J. <b>Blit</b> {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York, was the eldest of two sons, {{and grew up in}} the {{neighborhood}} of Mill Basin, where he attended South Shore High School. His father is a Cuban-American and his mother is of English and Romanian descent. <b>Blit</b> received his Bachelor of Arts Degree from Saint John's University in 1997. In 2000, <b>Blit</b> graduated from St. John's University School of Law, earning the degree of Juris Doctor.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{computer}} graphics card displays almost overwhelmingly use raster techniques, dividing the screen into a rectangular grid of pixels, {{due to the}} relatively low cost of raster-based video hardware as compared with vector graphic hardware. Most graphic hardware has internal support for <b>blitting</b> operations or sprite drawing. A co-processor dedicated to <b>blitting</b> {{is known as a}} Blitter chip.|$|E
50|$|QuickDraw {{provides}} a similar <b>blitting</b> function {{which is designed}} to implement scrolling within a GrafPort - the image in the port can be shifted to a new location without scaling (but with clipping if desired).|$|E
50|$|The {{operating}} system might allow {{a process to}} modify its code. There are various reasons for this (e.g., <b>blitting</b> graphics quickly) but this would cause a problem with reentrancy, since the code {{might not be the}} same next time.|$|E

50|$|In {{the second}} <b>blit,</b> the sprite is <b>blitted</b> onto the newly altered {{background}} using the raster operator of OR. Because any value ORed with 0 is unchanged, {{the background is}} unaffected and the black areas are filled with the actual sprite image.|$|R
5000|$|The folk {{etymology}} for the <b>Blit</b> name is that {{it stands}} for Bell Labs Intelligent Terminal, and its creators have also joked that it actually stood for Bacon, Lettuce, and Interactive Tomato. However, Rob Pike's paper on the <b>Blit</b> explains that it was named after the second syllable of bit <b>blit,</b> a common name for the bit-block transfer operation that is fundamental to the terminal's graphics. [...] Its original nickname was the jerq, inspired by Three Rivers' PERQ graphic workstation.|$|R
50|$|A classic use for <b>blitting</b> is {{to render}} {{transparent}} sprites onto a background. In this example a background image, a sprite, and a 1-bit mask are used. As the mask is 1-bit, {{there is no}} possibility for partial transparency via alpha blending.|$|E
50|$|An entire BitMap (or PixMap, when {{referring}} to color images) may be copied from one GrafPort to another, with scaling and clipping. Known as <b>blitting,</b> or CopyBits, after {{the name of the}} function, this operation is the basis for most animation and sprite-like effects on the Mac.|$|E
5000|$|In Applesoft BASIC, integer {{arithmetic}} {{was implemented}} {{on top of}} floating-point arithmetic, {{and there were no}} bitwise operators and no support for <b>blitting</b> of raster graphics (even though the language supported vector graphics on the Apple II's raster hardware). This caused games and other programs written in BASIC to run slower.|$|E
50|$|The Mark II <b>Blit</b> was {{the wagon}} {{version of the}} X110 Mark II. It served as a {{replacement}} of the Toyota Mark II Qualis, and shared a platform with the Mark II rear wheel drive sedan. The <b>Blit</b> was introduced in January 2002 after the Crown Estate and Caldina wagons ended production starting in June 2007 due to consolidation efforts. The <b>Blit</b> was {{a return to the}} Mark II platform with rear wheel drive with optional AWD and not a wagon version of the front wheel drive Camry. The <b>Blit</b> used straight-six engines with an optional turbo that was discontinued in May 2006.

5000|$|The {{story has}} three sequels, [...] "What Happened at Cambridge IV", [...] "comp.basilisk FAQ", and [...] "Different Kinds of Darkness". The last story imagines a post-apocalyptic world where <b>BLIT</b> images are everywhere, and {{millions}} {{have already been}} murdered by terrorist attacks utilizing them. Television and the internet have been outlawed due to the proliferation of <b>BLIT</b> images. In order to protect children, special chips have been planted in their brains that creates a subjective and artificial darkness (which the children call [...] "type-two darkness") to obscure any possible <b>BLIT</b> image they may inadvertently look at. The main characters, all school children, form the [...] "Shudder Club", where they take turns looking at a <b>BLIT</b> image to see how long they last, inadvertently vaccinating themselves against them.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blit</b> {{operation}} from {{screen to}} image works now.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Blitting</b> {{moves the}} same types of {{patterns}} about the screen, but does so by writing into the same memory {{as the rest of the}} display. This means every time the pattern is placed on the screen, the display [...] "under" [...] it is overwritten, or [...] "damaged". It is up to the software to clean this damage up by <b>blitting</b> twice, once to remove the damage, and then again to place the bit in its new location. However, there are several ways to optimize this. If large areas of the screen are taken over by the patterns, it may be more efficient to blit the background to the screen instead of erasing each pattern individually. A variation involves dividing the screen into segments and erasing only the segments where patterns have been drawn on. This technique is known as dirty rectangles.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Blitting</b> {{is similar}} to hardware-sprite drawing, in that both systems {{reproduce}} a pattern, typically a square area, at different locations on the screen. Hardware sprites {{have the advantage of}} being stored in separate memory, and therefore don't disturb the main display memory. This allows them to be moved about the display, covering the [...] "background", with no effect on it.|$|E
50|$|The VDC lacked sprite {{capabilities}}, which limited {{its use in}} gaming applications. However, it did contain <b>blitting</b> {{capabilities to}} autonomously perform small block memory copies within its dedicated video RAM. While the VDC is performing such a copy, the system CPU can continue running code, provided no other VDC accesses are attempted before the copy is finished. These functions were used by the C128's screen editor ROM to rapidly scroll or clear screen sections.|$|E

In addition, <b>Blit</b> has represented a number of exotic dancers in sexual harassment and wage and hour claims against gentleman's clubs.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} <b>blit,</b> the mask is <b>blitted</b> onto the {{background}} using the raster operator of AND. Because any value ANDed with 0 equals 0, and any value ANDed with 1 is unchanged, black areas are created where the actual sprites will appear, while leaving {{the rest of}} the background alone.|$|R
50|$|Windows 7 {{includes}} GDI {{hardware acceleration}} for <b>blitting</b> {{operations in the}} Windows Display Driver Model v1.1. This improves GDI performance of the Canonical Display Driver and allows DWM engine to use local video memory for compositing, thereby reducing system memory footprint and increasing the performance of graphics operations. Most primitive GDI operations are still not hardware-accelerated, unlike Direct2D. As of November 2009, both AMD and Nvidia have released WDDM v1.1 compatible video drivers.|$|E
50|$|In computing, {{hardware}} acceleration {{is the use}} of computer hardware to perform some functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on a more general-purpose CPU. Examples of {{hardware acceleration}} include <b>blitting</b> acceleration functionality in graphics processing units (GPUs) and regular expression hardware acceleration for spam control in the server industry. The hardware that performs the acceleration, when in a separate unit from the CPU, is referred to as a hardware accelerator, or often more specifically as a 3D accelerator, cryptographic accelerator, etc.|$|E
50|$|DirectDraw is a {{deprecated}} API {{that used}} {{to be a part of}} Microsoft's DirectX API. DirectDraw is used to accelerate rendering of graphics in applications. DirectDraw also allows applications to run fullscreen or embedded in a window such as most other MS Windows applications. DirectDraw uses hardware acceleration if it is available on the client's computer. DirectDraw allows direct access to video memory, hardware overlays, hardware blitters, and page flipping. Its video memory manager can manipulate video memory with ease, taking full advantage of the <b>blitting</b> and color decompression capabilities of different types of display adapters.|$|E

5000|$|When True BASIC {{appeared}} {{on the market in}} 1985, the BASIC language was widely used on home computers, but with little standardization. Each manufacturer implemented extensions to the language to support features of their hardware. Initially based on Dartmouth BASIC 7 [...] - [...] otherwise known as ANSI BASIC [...] - [...] True BASIC implemented a number of new features over GW-BASIC, and allowed the user a redefinable 16-color, 640×480 pixel backdrop for program editing. True BASIC introduced new functions for graphics primitives like plot, plot area, flood, etc. It also was the first to provide a method for saving a portion of the screen and <b>blitting</b> it elsewhere, but had no proper buffering implementation.|$|E
50|$|WinG {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} DC called a WinGDC, which allowed programmers to both read and write to it directly using device-independent bitmaps (DIBs) with the wingdib.drv driver. Effectively, it gave programmers the ability to do with Windows what they'd been doing without hardware access limitations in DOS for years. Programmers could write DIBs to the WinGDC, yet would still have access to the individual bits of the image data. This meant that fast graphics algorithms could be written to allow fast scrolling, overdraw, dirty rectangles, double buffering, and other animation techniques. WinG also provided much better performance when <b>blitting</b> graphics data to physical graphics device memory. Since WinG used the DIB format, it was possible to mix original GDI API calls and WinG calls.|$|E
5000|$|Graphics {{capability}} was {{not taken}} seriously {{in the original}} IBM design brief; graphics were considered only {{from the perspective of}} generating static business graphics such as charts and graphs. MS-DOS did not have an API for graphics, and the BIOS only included the rudimentary graphics functions such as changing screen modes and plotting single points. To make a BIOS call for every point drawn or modified increased overhead considerably, making the BIOS interface notoriously slow. Because of this, line-drawing, arc-drawing, and <b>blitting</b> had to be performed by the application to achieve acceptable speed, which was usually done by bypassing the BIOS and accessing video memory directly. Software written to address IBM PC hardware directly would run on any IBM clone, but would have to be rewritten especially for each non-PC-compatible MS-DOS machine.|$|E
