The Liberals argued that it is improper for a speaker to change his affiliation and refuse to recognize the government as a majority.

The British government ignored the resolutions for over three years until in 1837 it countered the Parti Patriote's requests with ten resolutions of its own, called the Russel Resolutions, while rejecting all proposed ninety-two resolutions made by Papineau and his party. These resolutions allowed the colony governor to obtain <b>budgetary</b> <b>estimates</b> without vote of the assembly, which brought about verbal and physical violence, and eventually led to the Rebellions of 1837. After the rebellions, many patriotes were exiled, hanged, or had their houses set ablaze, which marked the end of the party.

50|$|However, {{construction}} of the 7,804 meter long tunnel proved to be extremely difficult due to numerous unforeseen problems with the local geology and contemporary tunneling technology. The Hakone mountain range is an active volcanic zone, containing a number of faults and is subject to frequent earthquakes. In addition, workers encountered problems with a huge volume of water seepage, soft rock formations, and vents of hot spring water. On April 1, 1920, a large section of the tunnel from the Atami side collapsed, trapping 42 workers, 17 of whom were rescued a week later after heroic efforts to dig them out. The tunnel was also damaged during the Great Kantō earthquake without fatalities; however, another section collapsed during an earthquake on February 26, 1930, killing five more workers. The work took many years more than initially anticipated, and costs far exceeded original <b>budgetary</b> <b>estimates.</b> The total number of workers killed in during construction was 67 men.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Construction cost risk {{management}} {{is an essential}} part of construction cost management, especially in the context of the ‘triple overrun ’ that has been rampant across China over the last few years，i. e. the cost overrunning the budget，the budget overrunning the <b>budgetary</b> <b>estimate,</b> and the <b>budgetary</b> <b>estimate</b> overrunning the initial estimate. Since traditional methods of calculating construction reserve funds fail to serve the purpose of curbing the ‘triple overrun’，we deem it necessary to establish a quantitative, rational, and accurate calculation and analytical model to measure basic reserve funds. This paper aims to provide an analytical model based on the VaR technique, where parameters are determined by VaR’s three key factors, and a standard VaR process of analyzing basic reserve funds is set up. The model proves to be effective in our case study when basic reserve funds predicted by the model well match the actual ones，which is shown clearly by the Q-Q plot curves and CDF curves...|$|E
40|$|The Nigeria {{budgetary}} {{practices have}} been characterised with indiscipline and flagrant disregards to budgetary rules and procedures. This {{culture has been}} substantially attributed to the long years of military rule. This paper juxtaposes military and civilian regimes in Nigeria with respect to adherence to <b>budgetary</b> <b>estimates.</b> Eight years for each regime were purposively considered (1991 – 1998 and 1999 - 2006). Time series data were retrieved from secondary sources and analysed using simple variances, percentages, descriptive statistics as well as independent T-Test. The paper found that although budget discipline under democratic regime is arithmetically higher that budget discipline under military system, the difference is not statistically significant. It was therefore recommended that since budget is a law (appropriation Act); it should be accorded the same respect like any other act of the National Assembly as a justification for the democratic tenet {{of the rule of}} law. To that end budget implementation and control should be judiciously enforced with a view to achieving the lofty objectives that accompanies each year’s budget, as well as reduce the negative pressure that budget indiscipline engenders...|$|R

40|$|According to {{the theory}} of {{efficient}} markets, economic agents use all available information to form rational expectations. Fiscal marksmanship, the accuracy of budgetary forecasting, can be one important piece of such information the rational agents must consider in forming expectations. Using Theil’s inequality coefficient (U) based on the mean square prediction error, the paper estimates the magnitude of errors in the budgetary forecasts in India for the period 1990 - 91 to 2003 - 04 and also decomposed the errors into biasedness, unequal variation and random components to analyze the source of error. The test of rational expectations revealed that neither revenue nor expenditure forecasts in India is rational. However, capital budget revealed more forecast errors than revenue budget. The results also revealed that degree of errors in forecasting of receipts was relatively higher than that of expenditure. However there is no specific trend in the forecasting errors, which reveals that <b>budgetary</b> <b>estimates</b> are made not based on adaptive expectations. The proportion of error due to random variation has been significantly higher (which is beyond the control of the forecaster), while the errors due to bias has been negligible. The analysis related to efficiency of forecasts also showed that no significant improvement in forecasts over time. ...|$|R

Recently the BIM {{concept that}} all {{professionals}} carry out collaborative work among domains and {{departments in the}} industry has attracted more and more attention by research scholars and engineers around the world.

In view of this key problem, this article introduces {{the situation of the}} BIM research and development in domestic and overseas, and indicates that there are several common problems existing in the BIM development, such as, the information of multiple projects cannot be stored in a centralized database; the information is lost or incorrect when importing and exporting IFC model files with popular BIM software; the application software based on BIM technology is quite few, etc. The paper points out that the realization of BIM technology shall be based on the BIM database which is based on IFC standard. After that, this paper discusses how to build the BIM database based on IFC standard, the application interface of BIM database, the function of <b>budgetary</b> <b>estimates</b> and the transplantation of structural model conversion to BIM database. Then, a few examples are given to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of the BIM database and corresponding applications developed in this research.

VA's budget documentation showed that it had spent $ 100 million on Hepatitis C screening and treatment, leaving a difference of $ 95 million between its estimated and actual expenditures.

VA's documentation showed that only $ 50 million was used for budgeted activities and $ 50 million was used for an activity not included in its original budget [...] treatment of conditions related to Hepatitis C. It appears that VA is unable to develop a budget estimate that can reliably forecast its Hepatitis C funding needs at this time. However, VA's Veterans Health Administration (VHA) appears to be taking reasonable steps to improve future budget estimates and thereby minimize the potential for large differences. Such steps include developing a Hepatitis C patient registry that could provide the critical data needed to improve <b>budgetary</b> <b>estimates.</b> However, this registry could {{take as long as}} 15 months to become operational, which suggests that it may not provide budgetary data in time to formulate the 2004 budget.
