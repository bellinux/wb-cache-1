Geffen released Semantics, internationally, as a long play album with six newly re-recorded tracks compiled from their first three studio albums.

Before Guy's death, he had recorded demos with his brother Bill McDonough, and ex-members of their earlier band, The Flatheads. Bill McDonough assembled the tapes and produced Guy McDonough's posthumous album My Place on Wheatley Records in April 1985. Tracks from these sessions were re-mastered and released on Lost & Found in 1996, credited under the 'Members of Australian Crawl' name. Meanwhile, remaining Australian Crawl members had recorded their fourth studio album, <b>Between</b> <b>a</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> Hard Place, which was released in 1985 and achieved number11 on the albums charts. This was followed by the announcement that they would disband after another tour.

40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} of this work is to develop elements to improve understanding of the behaviour of a coppice {{in relation to the}} phenomenon of falling boulders. The first sec-tion proposes an amendment to the equation for calculating the index which describes the probability of impact <b>between</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> plants in managed coppice forests. A study was carried out, using models to calculate the kinetic energy of a falling boulder along a slope considering the kinetic en-ergy dissipated during the impact with the structure of for-est plants managed by coppice. The output of the simulation models were then compared with the real dynamics of falling boulders in field tests using digital video. It emerged from an analysis of the results of this compari-son that a modification to the 1989 Gsteiger equation was re-quired, in order to calculate the “Average Distance between Contacts ” (ADC). To this purpose, the concept of “Structure of Interception”, proposed in this paper, was developed, valid as a first approach for describing the differences in the spatial distribution of stems between coppice and forest. This study also aims to provide suggestions for forestry management, in order to maintain or increase the protective capacity of a coppice managed with conventional techniques for the area studied, modifying the dendrometric characteristics. ...|$|R
