40|$|Harmful algal blooms and {{red tides}} are {{emerging}} as widening conservation threats, with impacts to oceans, estuaries, and vulnerable species. Algal blooms harm marine ecosystems in two major ways: 1) their proliferation and decomposition causes dead zones by depleting oxygen levels; and 2) various species also produce {{an array of}} toxins that harm the liver, nervous system or other tissues of affected people and animals (Gilbert et al. 2005). Climate change is creating conditions that increase the likelihood and impacts of harmful algal <b>blooms.</b> <b>layer,</b> and very little mixing between {{the upper and lower}} layers, oxygen levels quickly plunge to levels that cannot sustain fish, crabs and other organisms. Mobile animals like fish can escape, but more sessile creatures are killed outright, hence the term “dead zone. ” Dead zones for...|$|R
40|$|By {{the field}} {{observation}} {{on the water}} quality in Kawahara Lake, {{it was found that}} the phytoplankton biomass, of which dominant species was Gonyostomum semen (G. semen), grew and aggregated densely in the middle layer in summer season. The diel migration of aggregated layer of G. semen was observed by using the mesocosm in the field. In the daytime G. semen aggregated at the depth of about 3 m and in the nighttime about 6. 5 m. Then, the laboratory experiment by using the microcosm was conducted to make clear characteristics on diel vertical migration of G. semen. As the results of the microcosm experiment, it was found that G. semen moved downward for the nutrient salts at nighttime, and G. semen stopped the downward migration when reached the anaerobic layer in strong reduction. Also, the upward migration of G. semen was influenced by pH and the photon flux density. In addition, there is a correlation in pH and the photon flux density in the top of G. semen's <b>bloom</b> <b>layer.</b> It was found that the optimum photon flux density for G. semen decreased with the rise of pH...|$|R
40|$|The spatiotemporal {{changes in}} {{abundance}} and biomass of heterotrophic bacteria, of three major bacterial phylogenetic groups, and of picocyanobacteria {{in the upper}} 20 m of a deep prealpine lake (Lake Zurich, Switzerland) were monitored during a seasonally persistent bloom of the toxigenic filamentous cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens. In addition, bacterial 16 S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) sequences were collected at one instance from the <b>bloom</b> <b>layer</b> and from waters above and below this zone. P. rubescens comprised up to 70 % of particulate organic carbon during summer stratification and autumnal mixis and thus by far exceeded the total biomass both of other phytoplankton and of prokaryotes. A strong negative correlation {{was found between the}} estimated basin-wide biomass of P. rubescens and of heterotrophic bacteria, and there was different spatial niche preference of filamentous vs. picocyanobacteria. Only members of the Cytophaga– Flavobacterium lineage of Bacteroidetes showed an increasing tendency of association with the P. rubescens population, in particular at the onset of autumnal mixing. Although the filamentous cyanobacterium was the dominant primary producer throughout the year, it {{did not seem to be}} a carbon source for heterotrophic bacteria at all. We conclude that P. rubescens represents a powerful competitor of autotrophic and heterotrophic prokaryotes, likely due to both its specific physiological (photoheterotrophic) properties and its protection against zooplankton grazing. This competitiveness might be regarded as another reason for its mass occurrence in numerous lakes of the Northern hemisphere. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Rubber is {{viscoelastic}} {{in nature}} and used {{in a variety of}} industrial applications. Rubber mounts are used to dampen vibration and shock. Damping, fatigue and dynamic properties of rubber mounts depend to a large extent on chemical ingredients mixed with the rubber. Natural rubber is the most widely used polymer for conventional mounts. Apart from natural rubber, different fillers and rubber chemicals are also present in conventional formulation of rubber mounts. Conventionally, five different classes of chemical curatives are used in rubber industries, which include curing agents, primary and secondary accelerators as well as primary and secondary activators. When chemical curatives are present in excessive amounts in rubber, they migrate to the rubber surface and form a <b>bloomed</b> <b>layer.</b> In this work, two rubber formulations were used for preparing rubber-to-metal bonded bobbin mounts. The formulations were primarily based on natural rubber with 60 parts per hundred rubber by weight (p. h. r.) precipitated amorphous white silica nanofiller. The surface of silica was pre-treated with bis(3 -triethoxysilylpropyl) -tetrasulphane (TESPT) coupling agent to chemically bond silica to the rubber. The rubber was cured primarily by reacting the tetrasulphane groups of TESPT with the rubber chains using a sulphenamide accelerator and the cure was then optimised by adding zinc oxide as an activator. The ratio of the accelerator to activator in one compound was 6 p. h. r. / 0. 3. p. h. r. and the compound showed extensive blooming of the accelerator on the rubber surface when stored at ambient temperature for up to 60 days. However, the blooming was reduced significantly by changing the ratio of the accelerator to activator to 3 p. h. r. / 2. 5. p. h. r., which was subsequently used to prepare a second compound. Dynamic and static properties of the bobbins were subsequently measured. Both compounds showed very low phase angle (δ) and spring rate ratio K d /K s (K d : dynamic spring rate; K s : static spring rate). Notably, the compound with the high accelerator to activator ratio had superior aforementioned properties, but the dynamic fatigue life of the bobbin reduced noticeably due to a gradual deterioration of the bond caused by the migration of the accelerator to the bonded interface...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEcological {{consequences}} {{of global warming}} include shifts of species ranges toward higher altitudes and latitudes as well as temporal shifts in phenology and life-cycle events. Evidence is accumulating that increasing temperature is also linked to reduced body size of ectotherms. While temperature can act directly on body size, it may also act indirectly by affecting the timing of life-cycle events and the resulting population age and size structure, especially in seasonal environments. Population structure may, in turn, be influenced by temperature-driven changes in resource availability. In a field mesocosm experiment, we investigated how water temperature and mixed surface layer depth (a temperature-dependent determinant of light availability to phytoplankton) affected population dynamics, population age and size structure, and individual size at stage (size at first reproduction) of Daphnia hyalina during and after a phytoplankton spring <b>bloom.</b> Mixed <b>layer</b> depth was inversely related to the magnitudes of the phytoplankton spring bloom and the subsequent Daphnia peak, but {{had no effect on}} the body size of Daphnia. Conversely, temperature had no effects on abundance peaks but strongly affected the timing of these events. This resulted in at times positive, at other times negative, transient effects of temperature on mean body size, caused by asynchronous changes in population size structure in cold versus warm treatments. In contrast to mean body size, individual size at stage consistently decreased with increasing temperature. We suggest that size at stage could be used as an unbiased response parameter to temperature that is unaffected by transient, demographically driven changes in population size structure...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple system}} of parametrically forced {{ordinary}} differential equations {{is used to}} model autumn phytoplankton blooms in temperate oceans by a mechanism involving deepening of the upper mixed <b>layer.</b> <b>Blooms</b> are triggered provided the increase in nutrients in the mixed layer is rapid within {{the first few days}} of deepening and provided light-limited phytoplankton growth rate is relatively high. Blooms exist as transient trajectories between quasi-equilibrium states, rather than as bifurcations of steady states; therefore very gradual deepening cannot trigger blooms. Very rapid deepening also prevents blooms due to the deleterious effect on phytoplankton growth rate. The mechanisms identified by this simple model are vindicated by considering alternative grazing and deepening regimes and by comparison with a more ecologically complex model (Fasham, 1993, in The Global Carbon Cycle, Springer-Verlag). Modelled estimates of primary productivity from both the simple model and the complex model parameterized for Ocean Weather Station ‘India’ are around 0. 5 g C m– 2 day– 1 during the autumn bloom, therefore comprising a significant component of annual production in temperate areas...|$|R
40|$|The Gulf of California {{is unique}} {{because of its}} {{geographical}} location and conformation. It hosts diverse ecosystems and important fisheries that support industry and provide livelihood to coastal settlements. It is also the site of interests and problems, and an intense interaction among managers, producers, and conservationists. In this report, we scrutinize the abiotic (hydrography, climate, ocean circulation, and chemistry) and biotic (phyto- and zooplankton, fish, invertebrates, marine mammals, birds, and turtles) components of the marine ecosystem, and some particular aspects of climate variability, endemisms, harmful algal <b>blooms,</b> oxygen minimum <b>layer,</b> and pollution. We also review the current conditions and conflicts around the main fisheries (shrimp, small and large pelagic fishes, squid, artisanal and sportfishing), the most important human activity in the Gulf of California. We cover some aspects of management and conservation of fisheries, especially the claimed overexploitation of fish resources and the ecosystems, and review proposals for creating networks of marine protected areas. We conclude by identifying main needs for information and research, particularly the integration of data bases, the implementation of models and paleoreconstructions, establishment of monitoring programs, and the evaluation of fishing impacts and management actions...|$|R
40|$|Source: DOI: [URL] The {{structure}} of marine pelagic food webs determines {{the fate of}} organic carbon and productivity, {{but it is difficult}} to measure. We compared two common methods (stable isotope analyses, SIAs, and biovolume spectrum theories, BSTs) of estimating trophic positions (TPs) of mesozooplankton. Two sets of stations across the North Atlantic (Iceland Basin, Irminger Basin, Labrador Sea) were clearly separated. In the East, we observed a very early spring <b>bloom,</b> with mixed <b>layer</b> depths > 500 m, chlorophyll a evenly distributed, and the Calanus population was dominated by CV/adults. Here, TPs based on both methods were comparable, with a TP of 2 for small zooplankton and 2 – 3 for larger species. In the West, a more advanced stage of the bloom was observed, with mixed layer depths < 100 m, surface maxima of chlorophyll a, higher proportions of young stages of Calanus and more abundant microzooplankton. Here, significant differences in TPs were observed, with those based on BST being ~ 1 and 3 higher than those based on SIA, for small (TP ~ 3) and large (TP ~ 5) species, respectively. We conclude that BSTs capture energy flow through the microbial food web that is undetected by estimations using stable isotopes...|$|R
