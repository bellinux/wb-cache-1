50|$|Thermotropism or thermotropic {{movement}} is {{the movement of}} a plant or part of a plant {{in response to a}} change in temperature. A common example is the curling of Rhododendron leaves in response to cold temperatures. Mimosa pudica also show thermotropism <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapsing</b> <b>of</b> leaf petioles leading to the folding of leaflets, when temperature drops.|$|R

5|$|Incapillo is a Pleistocene caldera, a {{depression}} formed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> a volcano, in the La Rioja province of Argentina. Part of the Argentine Andes, {{it is considered}} the southernmost volcanic centre in the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes with Pleistocene activity. Incapillo {{is one of several}} ignimbritic or calderic systems that, along with 44 active stratovolcanoes, are part of the Central Volcanic Zone.|$|E
5|$|St. John's, and the {{province}} as a whole, was gravely affected in the 1990s <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> the northern cod fishery, {{which had been}} {{the driving force of}} the provincial economy for hundreds of years. After a decade of high unemployment rates and depopulation, the city's proximity to the Hibernia, Terra Nova and White Rose oil fields led to an economic boom that spurred population growth and commercial development. As a result, the St. John's area now accounts for about half of {{the province}}'s economic output.|$|E
5|$|The main {{criticism}} levelled at the EIHL is {{that the}} league is too expensive, an accusation given credence <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> the London Racers mid season in 2005, and the continued financial problems experienced {{by a number of}} other member clubs (most notably Basingstoke Bison and Manchester Phoenix in 2008–09). Both the Edinburgh Capitals and Newcastle Vipers made public statements about their potentially perilous financial situations, casting further doubt over both their own, and the league's sustained viability.|$|E
50|$|Suspended {{ceilings}} in indoor {{swimming pools}} are safety-relevant components. As was demonstrated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{ceiling of the}} Uster (Switzerland) indoor swimming pool (1985) and again at Steenwijk (Netherlands, 2001), attention must be paid to selecting suitable materials and inspecting the state of such components. The reason for the failures was stress corrosion cracking of metal fastening components made of stainless steel. The active chemical was chlorine added to the water as a disinfectant.|$|R
25|$|The {{commission}} classified {{the accident}} as survivable because the impact forces varied along the fuselage. The tail-first impact was caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> first officer's last-second attempt at raising the aircraft. Most of the fatalities resulted from people having been {{trapped in the}} sinking sections, which was caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapsing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure after impact. <b>The</b> <b>collapse</b> was caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> compromise of the tubular integrity, which was dependent on the keel beam that had been torn off on impact.|$|R

5|$|As part of post-Cold War restructuring, NATO's {{military}} {{structure was}} cut back and reorganized, with new forces {{such as the}} Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps established. The changes brought about <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> the Soviet Union on the military balance in Europe were recognized in the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, which was signed in 1999. The policies of French President Nicolas Sarkozy resulted in a major reform of France's military position, culminating with the return to full membership on 4April 2009, which also included France rejoining the NATO Military Command Structure, while maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent.|$|E
5|$|Over 225,000residents lost {{electricity}} and 12,000 lost telephone service. Some vandalism and looting was reported during {{the loss of}} power, and the police made several arrests during the night. For over 24hours roads were closed on the islands of El Hierro, Tenerife and La Palma: the first two due to landslides and the third <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> an old house and a massive tree. One {{of the most famous}} geological features of the island of Gran Canaria, El Dedo de Dios (or God's finger), which had been pointing towards the sky for over a millennium, was destroyed by Delta's wind and wave action along Gran Canaria's shore. Upon hearing of the destruction of the natural monument one man, later found to be clinically insane, unsuccessfully tried to kill himself and then stabbed three members of his own family.|$|E
5|$|Rima Hadley, a sinuous rille located {{west of the}} Apollo 15 landing site, {{begins in}} an area of low domes at an {{elongated}} crater, Běla, and runs on to the North along the Apennine Mountain Range. Some research has suggested that both the rille and Běla are volcanic vents, and lava flows created the features. Another hypothesis suggests that the rille was originally an underground lava tube, the roof of which collapsed, creating the current appearance of the rille. Several large boulders, some of which are as large as houses, are strewn about the feature's floor. The elongated crater Běla, which forms the beginning of Rima Hadley, could have been formed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> a shallow magma chamber. Visual observation suggests that the same is the case with other lunar rilles with similar features at their beginnings.|$|E

50|$|Walter S. Amos was {{contracted}} {{by several}} private {{and government agencies}} to search for caves and caverns to open in conjunction with Skyline Drive. During his search, he came across a sinkhole that was located approximately where the parking lot is currently situated. Normally, sinkholes are created <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapsing</b> <b>of</b> a cavern roof, which takes the ground above with it. When he saw there was no water in the sinkhole, which meant {{there had to be}} a drain nearby, he believed he had discovered a cavern.|$|R
5|$|The Hoxne Hoard {{was buried}} {{during a period}} of great {{upheaval}} in Britain, marked <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> Roman authority in the province, the departure {{of the majority of the}} Roman army, and the first of a wave of attacks by the Anglo-Saxons. Attacks on Italy by the Visigoths around the turn of the fifth century caused the general Stilicho to recall Roman army units from Rhaetia, Gaul, and Britannia. While Stilicho held off the Visigoth attack, the Western provinces were left defenceless against Suebi, Alans, and Vandals who crossed the frozen Rhine in 406 and overran Gaul. The remaining Roman troops in Britain, fearing that the invaders would cross the Channel, elected a series of emperors of their own to lead the defence.|$|E
5|$|The Knox and Kane Railroad {{was forced}} to suspend {{operations}} in October 2004 after a 75percent {{decline in the number}} of passengers, possibly brought about <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> the Kinzua Bridge. The Kovalchick Corporation bought the Knox and Kane's tracks and all other property owned by the railroad, including the locomotives and rolling stock. The Kovalchick Corporation also owns the East Broad Top Railroad and was the company that owned the Kinzua Bridge before selling it to the state in 1963. The company disclosed plans in 2008 to remove the tracks and sell them for scrap. The right-of-way would then be used to establish a rail trail.|$|E
5|$|These {{events are}} {{at the tail end}} of the long GRB {{duration}} distribution, lasting more than 10,000 seconds. They have been proposed to form a separate class, caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> a blue supergiant star, a tidal disruption event or a new-born magnetar. Only a small number have been identified to date, their primary characteristic being their gamma ray emission duration. The most studied ultra-long events include GRB 101225A and GRB 111209A. The low detection rate may be a result of low sensitivity of current detectors to long-duration events, rather than a reflection of their true frequency. A 2013 study, on the other hand, shows that the existing evidence for a separate ultra-long GRB population with a new type of progenitor is inconclusive, and further multi-wavelength observations are needed to draw a firmer conclusion.|$|E
50|$|Failed supernovae {{are thought}} to create stellar black holes <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapsing</b> <b>of</b> a red supergiant star {{in the early stages}} of a supernova. When the star can no longer support itself, <b>the</b> core <b>collapses</b> completely, forming a stellar-mass black hole, and {{consuming}} the nascent supernova without having the massive explosion. For a distant observer, the red supergiant star will seem to wink out of existence with little or no flare-up. The observed instances of these disappearances seem to involve supergiant stars with masses above 17 solar masses.|$|R
50|$|When the RNA {{transcript}} reaches 7 nucleotides long, transcription {{enters the}} elongation phase, {{the beginning of}} which is characterised <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapsing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DNA bubble and the ejection of TFIIB. This {{is thought to be}} because the nascent RNA clashes with the B linker helix when it is 6 bases long and upon further elongation to 12-13 bases it will clash with the B-reader and B-ribbon leading to dissociation. The DNA duplex also clashes with the B linker above <b>the</b> rudder (caused <b>by</b> rewinding of <b>the</b> DNA into a double helix).|$|R

5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E
5|$|Several {{communities}} in Baker County were devastated, leaving seven people dead, {{as many as}} 100 injured, and hundreds destitute. The county sheriff estimated that merely a dozen houses out of a thousand survived the storm, that thousands of cows were killed, and that {{hundreds of thousands of}} trees were toppled. Not one church or school was left standing in the county, and damage there was estimated at $250,000. Eight people were killed in Suwannee County, including two children crushed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> their home near Wellborn. In Columbia County, dozens of buildings suffered near or total destruction, while nine people were killed. One woman lost her life in Grady, a small settlement in Lafayette County. Additionally, there were five fatalities in Bradford County, including one man reportedly struck by flying bricks that were lofted nearly a half mile downwind. Strong winds and heavy rainfall affected areas as far southeast as St. Augustine. In Fernandina Beach, the hurricane toppled oak trees and destroyed buildings. Although wind gusts in Jacksonville reached , the effects were generally insignificant.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Six of {{the eight}} double neutron stars known in the Galactic disk have low orbital eccentricities (< 0. 27) {{indicating}} that their second-born neutron stars received only very small velocity kicks at birth. This {{is similar to the}} case of the B-emission X-ray binaries, where a sizable fraction of the neutron stars received hardly any velocity kick at birth (Pfahl et al. 2002). The masses of the second-born neutron stars in five of the six low-eccentricity double neutron stars are remarkably low (between 1. 18 and 1. 30 M⊙). It is argued that these low-mass, low-kick neutron stars were formed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> electron-capture <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores of helium stars less massive than about 3. 5 M⊙, whereas the higher-mass, higher kick-velocity neutron stars were formed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iron cores of higher initial mass. The absence of low-velocity single young radio pulsars (Hobbs et al. 2005) is consistent with <b>the</b> model proposed <b>by</b> Podsiadlowski et al. (2004), in which <b>the</b> electron-capture <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores can only occur in binary systems, and not in single stars...|$|R
50|$|These models {{give the}} most {{authoritative}} {{support for the}} claim that EDM is a thermal process, removing material from the two electrodes because of melting and/or vaporization, along with pressure dynamics established in <b>the</b> spark-gap <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapsing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plasma channel. However, for small discharge energies the models are inadequate to explain the experimental data. All these models hinge {{on a number of}} assumptions from such disparate research areas as submarine explosions, discharges in gases, and failure of transformers, so {{it is not surprising that}} alternative models have been proposed more recently in the literature trying to explain the EDM process.|$|R
