Constriction {{of the upper}} and lower esophageal sphincters help to prevent reflux (<b>backflow)</b> of gastric contents and acid into the esophagus, protecting the esophageal mucosa.

5|$|When the {{atrioventricular}} valves (tricuspid and mitral) are open, during {{blood flow}} to the ventricles, the aortic and pulmonary valves are closed to prevent <b>backflow</b> into the ventricles. When the ventricular pressure is greater than the atrial pressure the tricuspid and mitral valves will shut. When the ventricles contract the pressure forces the aortic and pulmonary valves open. As the ventricles relax, the aortic and pulmonary valves will close in response to decreased pressure.|$|E
5|$|In humans, other mammals, and birds, {{the heart}} is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria; and lower left and right {{ventricle}}s. Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart. Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers. In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent <b>backflow.</b> The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains {{a small amount of}} fluid. The wall of {{the heart is}} made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium.|$|E

5|$|The {{mammalian}} {{heart has}} four chambers, two upper atria, the receiving chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The heart has four valves, which separate its chambers and ensures blood flows {{in the correct}} direction through the heart (preventing <b>backflow).</b> After gas exchange in the pulmonary capillaries (blood vessels in the lungs), oxygen-rich blood returns to the left atrium via {{one of the four}} pulmonary veins. Blood flows nearly continuously back into the atrium, which acts as the receiving chamber, and from here through an opening into the left ventricle. Most blood flows passively into the heart while both the atria and ventricles are relaxed, but {{toward the end of the}} ventricular relaxation period, the left atrium will contract, pumping blood into the ventricle. The heart also requires nutrients and oxygen found in blood like other muscles, and is supplied via coronary arteries.|$|E
5|$|Several imaging {{methods can}} be used to assess the anatomy and {{function}} of the heart, including ultrasound (echocardiography), angiography, CT scans, MRI and PET. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart used to measure the heart's function, assess for valve disease, and look for any abnormalities. Echocardiography can be conducted by a probe on the chest ("transthoracic") or by a probe in the esophagus ("transoesophageal"). A typical echocardiography report will include information about the width of the valves noting any stenosis, whether there is any <b>backflow</b> of blood (regurgitation) and information about the blood volumes at the end of systole and diastole, including an ejection fraction, which describes how much blood is ejected from the left and right ventricles after systole. Ejection fraction can then be obtained by dividing the volume ejected by the heart (stroke volume) by the volume of the filled heart (end-diastolic volume). Echocardiograms can also be conducted under circumstances when the body is more stressed, in order to examine for signs of lack of blood supply. This cardiac stress test involves either direct exercise, or where this is not possible, injection of a drug such as dobutamine.|$|E

Thus the nephroptosis was closely related to renal bleeding.

40|$|The {{interactions}} between horizontal ambient flow and divergent wind fields, {{such as those}} that obtain atop cumulonimbus complexes, were investigated (theoretically) kinematically. The following were observed from the results of the analyses. First, for a particular divergent field, the relative mass flux over the area of the nephsystem decreased as the strength of the horizontal flow increased. Secondly, while in some of the cases analyzed the interaction between the two flows only resulted in the fanning out of streamlines and a slight redistribution in the wind speed, in many cases <b>backflows</b> and a total reorganization of the wind field occurred. <b>Backflows</b> have a blocking effect on the horizontal flow.

40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} of pyroclastic density currents has developed significantly {{in recent years}} and is increasingly applied to volcanological research. Results from physical modeling are commonly taken into account in volcanic hazard assessment and in the definition of hazard mitigation strategies. In this work, we modeled pyroclastic density currents in the Phlegrean Fields caldera, where flows propagating along the flat ground could be confined by the old crater rims that separate downtown Naples from the caldera. The different eruptive scenarios (mass eruption rates, magma compositions, and water contents) were based on available knowledge of this volcanic system, and appropriate vent conditions were calculated for each scenario. Simulations were performed along different topographic profiles to evaluate the effects of topographic barriers on flow propagation. Simulations highlighted interesting features associated with the presence of obstacles such as the development of <b>backflows.</b> Complex interaction between outward moving fronts and <b>backflows</b> can affect flow propagation; if <b>backflows</b> reach the vent, they can even interfere with fountain dynamics and induce a more collapsing behavior. Results show {{that in the case of}} large events (108 kg/s), obstacles affect flow propagation by reducing flow velocity and hence dynamic pressure in distal regions, but they cannot stop the advancement of flows. Deadly conditions (in terms of temperature and ash concentration) characterize the entire region invaded by pyroclastic flows. In the case of small events (2. 5 107 kg/s), flows are confined by distal topographic barriers which provide valuable protection to the region beyond...|$|R
25|$|The {{cause is}} unknown, but {{is thought to}} result from {{abnormalities}} of the veins inside the testicles, leading to a backup of blood that cannot flow, which in turn causes swelling. There are three main theories as to the anatomical cause; the first {{has to do with}} the geometry of the veins, wherein the vein on the left side connects to the larger outflowing vein at a right angle, which tends to fail; the second is that valves that are supposed to prevent <b>backflow</b> fail (venous insufficiency); the third is that pressure in upstream arteries creates a “nutcracker” syndrome.|$|E

25|$|In {{the central}} circulatory system, the blood moves {{anteriorly}} {{from the tip}} of the abdomen {{to the front of the}} thorax through a sinus enveloping the alimentary canal, and posteriorly through a ventral blood vessel.

The dorsal vessel in some of the larger serpulids, like Serpula, possesses a valve and a muscular sphincter, probably to prevent <b>backflow</b> of blood from the transverse vessel.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the interplay between}} jets from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and the surrounding InterStellar Medium (ISM) through full 3 D, high resolution, Adaptive Mesh Refinement simulations performed with the FLASH code. We follow the jet- ISM system for several Myr in its transition from an early, compact source to an extended one including a large cocoon. During the jet evolution, we identify three major evolutionary stages and we find that, contrary {{to the prediction of}} popular theoretical models, none of the simulations shows a self-similar behavior. We also follow the evolution of the energy budget, and find that the fraction of input power deposited into the ISM (the AGN coupling constant) is of order of a few percent during the first few Myr. This is in broad agreement with galaxy formation models employing AGN feedback. However, we find that in these early stages, this energy is deposited only in a small fraction (< 1 %) of the total ISM volume. Finally we demonstrate the relevance of <b>backflows</b> arising within the extended cocoon generated by a relativistic AGN jet within the ISM of its host galaxy, previously proposed as a mechanism for self-regulating the gas accretion onto the central object. These <b>backflows</b> tend later to be destabilized by the 3 D dynamics, rather than by hydrodynamic (Kelvin- Helmholtz) instabilities. Yet, in the first few hundred thousand years, <b>backflows</b> may create a central accretion region of significant extent, and convey there as much as a few millions of solar masses.

40|$|I {{propose a}} {{scenario}} {{to account for}} the fast polar outflow detected to be blown by Eta Carinae in 2000. The scenario accounts also for the lack of this flow in 1998 and 1999. The scenario is based on the binary nature of Eta Carinae. The collision of the winds blown by the two stars, in particular near periastron passages, slows down about 5 per cent of the wind blown by Eta Carinae, i. e., the massive primary star, such that it stays bound to the system. I assume that most of this mass is accreted back through the equator by Eta Carinae during apastron passage, when its orbital velocity is much lower. The mass accretion rate of this <b>backflowing</b> material may become about 25 per cent of the wind's mass loss rate near apastron passages. If the <b>backflowing</b> matter has enough specific angular momentum it can form an accretion disk and may lead to the formation of a polar collimated fast wind (CFW) on top of the stellar wind.

Each pump has a flow control valve and a <b>backflow</b> preventing check valve on the outlet, and shutoff valves on both inlet and outlet.

25|$|Bileaflet {{heart valves}} consist of two semicircular {{leaflets}} that rotate about struts {{attached to the}} valve housing. This design was introduced in 1979 and while {{they take care of}} {{some of the issues that}} were seen in the other models, bileaflets are vulnerable to <b>backflow</b> and so they cannot be considered as ideal. Bileaflet valves do, however, provide much more natural blood flow than caged-ball or tilting-disc implants. One of the main advantages of these valves is that they are well tolerated by the body. Only a small amount of blood thinner is needed to be taken by the patient each day in order to prevent clotting of the blood when flowing through the valve.|$|E
25|$|A problem {{mostly of}} {{historical}} interest, but still relevant to surface supplied divers who dive with the helmet sealed {{to the dry}} suit. If the air supply hose is ruptured near or above the surface, the pressure difference between the water around the diver and {{the air in the}} hose can be several bar. The non-return valve at the connection to the helmet will prevent <b>backflow</b> if it is working correctly, but if absent, as {{in the early days of}} helmet diving, or if it fails, the pressure difference will tend to squeeze the diver into the rigid helmet, which can result in severe trauma. The same effect can result from a large and rapid increase in depth if the air supply is insufficient to keep up with the increase in ambient pressure.|$|E
25|$|Before {{a diving}} {{operation}} {{it is usually}} necessary {{to set up the}} surface supply equipment. There are a number of components which must be connected in the correct order, with checks at various stages to ensure that there are no leaks and everything functions correctly. Most diving contractors will have comprehensive checklists that are used to ensure that the equipment is connected in the appropriate sequence and all checks are done. Some checks are critical to the safety of the diver. The compressor must be set up so that it gets uncontaminated air to the intake. Filters should be checked in case they need to be changed. Air supply hoses will be connected to the air panel and checked for leaks, umbilicals connected to the panels and helmets, and the communications equipment connected and tested. Before the umbilical is connected to the helmet or full face mask, the umbilical should be blown through to ensure there is no dirt inside, and the non return valve on the bailout block must be given a function test. This is important, as it is there to prevent <b>backflow</b> of air up the umbilical if the line is cut, and if it fails the diver may suffer a helmet squeeze, or a neck dam flood.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{generalized}} form of open boundary conditions, and an associated numerical algorithm, for simulating incompressible flows involving open or outflow boundaries. The generalized form represents {{a family of}} open boundary conditions, which all ensure the energy stability of the system, even in situations where strong vortices or <b>backflows</b> occur at the open/outflow boundaries. Our numerical algorithm for treating these open boundary conditions {{is based on a}} rotational pressure correction-type strategy, with a formulation suitable for $C^ 0 $ spectral-element spatial discretizations. We have introduced a discrete equation and associated boundary conditions for an auxiliary variable. The algorithm contains constructions that prevent a numerical locking at the open/outflow boundary. In addition, we have also developed a scheme with a provable unconditional stability for a sub-class of the open boundary conditions. Extensive numerical experiments have been presented to demonstrate the performance of our method for several flow problems involving open/outflow boundaries. We compare simulation results with the experimental data to demonstrate the accuracy of our algorithm. Long-time simulations have been performed for a range of Reynolds numbers at which strong vortices or <b>backflows</b> occur at the open/outflow boundaries.
