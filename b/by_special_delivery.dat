60|$|The Child cried inconsolably, {{and grew}} hollow-eyed, knock-kneed, spindling, and corykilverty {{in many other}} respects. The Millionaire smiled and tapped his coffers confidently. The pick of {{the output of the}} French and German toymakers was rushed <b>by</b> <b>special</b> <b>delivery</b> to the mansion; but Rachel refused to be comforted. She was weeping for her rag child, and was for a high {{protective}} tariff against all foreign foolishness. Then doctors with the finest bedside manners and stop-watches were called in. One by one they chattered futilely about peptomanganate of iron and sea voyages and hypophosphites until their stop-watches showed that Bill Rendered was under the wire for show or place. Then, as men, they advised that the rag-doll be found as soon as possible and restored to its mourning parent. The Child sniffed at therapeutics, chewed a thumb, and wailed for her Betsy. And all this time cablegrams were coming from Santa Claus saying that he would soon be here and enjoining us to show a true Christian spirit and let up on the pool-rooms and tontine policies and platoon systems long enough to give him a welcome. Everywhere the spirit of Christmas was diffusing itself. The banks were refusing loans, the pawn-brokers had doubled their gang of helpers, people bumped your shins on the streets with red sleds, Thomas and Jeremiah bubbled before you on the bars while you waited on one foot, holly-wreaths of hospitality were hung in windows of the stores, they who had 'em were getting their furs. You hardly knew which was the best bet in balls--three, high, moth, or snow. It was no time at which to lose the rag-doll or your heart.|$|E

50|$|<b>Special</b> <b>Delivery,</b> a {{domestic}} accelerated local delivery service, was introduced on 3 March 1885 initially with {{a fee of}} 10¢ paid <b>by</b> a <b>Special</b> <b>Delivery</b> stamp. It was transformed into Express Mail, introduced in 1977 after an experimental period that started in 1970, although <b>Special</b> <b>Delivery</b> was not terminated until June 8, 1997.|$|R

25|$|Some of {{the reports}} they {{provided}} were casual. Spahr documents a letter from Edward D. Rapier of New Orleans, Louisiana who wrote that he accidentally tuned into a German broadcast and heard about Robert Spahr’s status. Others appeared more urgent. Mrs. Earl Seigle of Tyler, Texas {{sent a letter to}} Martha Spahr <b>by</b> airmail <b>special</b> <b>delivery.</b> Seigle noted the radio announcer's reading of a message from Robert Spahr: “I arrived safe in Germany as a prisoner. I will write later.” Others like Irwin F. Bender of Oberlin, Pennsylvania asked for the donation of a postage stamp so that he might continue to provide other families the same service. Sometimes letters got misrouted, and Martha Spahr once received news of a soldier named James C. Caraway. Many listeners like Herman Winkler of New York City were so dedicated to their practice they created letter templates to speed up the process.|$|R
5000|$|Thee Midniters were an East LA band. For a {{brief period}} of time the lead singer for the group was Little Ray aka Ray Jimenez. In 1964, Jimenez left the group. Willie Garcia, a.k.a. [...] "Little Willie G.", was the lead singer. [...] "Willie G. {{was one of the most}} soulful Latin persons I ever heard," [...] said the singer Brenton Wood. [...] "He could really deliver a sermon, and he had a lot of feeling in his vocals." [...] Garcia took obscure soul ballads such as [...] "The Town I Live In" [...] or [...] "Giving Up On Love" [...] and made them more {{beautiful}} <b>by</b> his own <b>special</b> <b>delivery.</b> After many years away from the band, Garcia returned in the 1990s. Lead guitarist was George Dominguez, whose forte was blues rock. Cesar Rosas, later to gain fame as one of the leaders of Los Lobos, would stare at George on stage to see how Thee Midniters' guitarist played leads and riffs that Rosas could not figure out on his own.

[...] Initially, only 555 such offices existed but the following year all U. S. Post Offices were obliged to provide the service—an extension not, however, reflected on the <b>Special</b> <b>Delivery</b> stamp until 1888, when the words [...] "at any post office" [...] appeared on its reprint. (On stamps of future years, the messenger would be provided the technological enhancements of a bicycle 1902 a motorcycle 1922 and a truck 1925. Although the last new U.S. <b>Special</b> <b>Delivery</b> stamp appeared issued in 1971, the service was continued until 1997, by which time it had largely been supplanted by Priority Mail delivery, introduced in 1989.) The 1885 <b>Special</b> <b>Delivery</b> issue was the first U.S. postage stamp designed in the double-width format. Eight years later, this shape would be chosen for the Columbian Exposition commemoratives, as it offered appropriate space for historical tableaux. The double-width layout would subsequently be employed in many United States Commemoratives.|$|R

50|$|The U.S. Post Office in {{conjunction}} with the Universal Postal Union established a basis for a special service for speedier delivery of mail for an extra fee beginning in 1885. <b>Special</b> <b>Delivery</b> was at first limited to post offices that operated in townships with populations of 4,000 or more. In 1886 Congress revised <b>Special</b> <b>Delivery</b> service to all U.S. post offices. <b>Special</b> <b>Delivery</b> service was in operation from 1885 to 1997 whereby the letter would be dispatched immediately and directly from the receiving post office to the recipient rather than being put in mail for distribution on the regular delivery route.|$|R
