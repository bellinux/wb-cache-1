Sometimes the turf, as in the neighbourhood of Newlands, is little broken, the whole covering being soft and downy pasturage. In other places rocks predominate; the soil is laid bare by torrents and <b>burstings</b> {{of water from the}} sides of the mountains in heavy rains; and not unfrequently their perpendicular sides are seamed by ravines (formed also by rains and torrents) which, meeting in angular points, entrench and scar the surface with numerous figures like the letters W. and Y.|$|E
60|$|But whoever will, with sympathy, {{which is}} the first {{essential}} towards insight, look at this questionable Mirabeau, may find that there lay verily in him, as the basis of all, a Sincerity, a great free Earnestness; nay call it Honesty, for the man did before all things see, with that clear flashing vision, into what was, into what existed as fact; and did, with his wild heart, follow that and no other. Whereby on what ways soever he travels and struggles, often enough falling, he is still a brother man. Hate him not; thou canst not hate him! Shining through such soil and tarnish, and now victorious effulgent, and oftenest struggling eclipsed, the light of genius itself is in this man; which was never yet base and hateful: but at worst was lamentable, loveable with pity. They say that he was ambitious, {{that he wanted to be}} Minister. It is most true; and was he not simply the one man in France who could have done any good as Minister? Not vanity alone, not pride alone; far from that! Wild <b>burstings</b> of affection were in this great heart; of fierce lightning, and soft dew of pity. So sunk, bemired in wretchedest defacements, it may be said of him, like the Magdalen of old, that he loved much: his Father the harshest of old crabbed men he loved with warmth, with veneration.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{transition}} from a silent state to a bursting state by varying the dc stimulus in the Hindmarsh-Rose neuron under quasiperiodic stimulation. For this quasiperiodically forced case, a new type of strange nonchaotic (SN) bursting state is found to occur between the silent state and the chaotic bursting state. This is in contrast to the periodically forced case where the silent state transforms directly to a chaotic bursting state. Using a rational approximation to the quasiperiodic forcing, the mechanism for the appearance of such an SN bursting state is investigated. Thus, a smooth torus (corresponding to a silent state) is found to transform to an SN bursting attractor through a phase-dependent subcritical period-doubling bifurcation. These SN bursting states, together with chaotic bursting states, are characterized in terms of the interburst interval, the bursting length, and the number of spikes in each burst. Both bursting states are found to be aperiodic complex ones. Consequently, aperiodic complex <b>burstings</b> may result from two dynamically different states with strange geometry (one is chaotic and the other one is nonchaotic). Thus, in addition to chaotic <b>burstings,</b> SN <b>burstings</b> may become a dynamical origin for complex physiological rhythms which are ubiquitous in organisms. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

40|$|Silicon neurons that burst when primed Abstract — We {{present a}} silicon neuron that {{responds}} with a highfrequency burst of spikes (> 250 Hz) when appropriately primed; otherwise it responds with lower frequency single spikes (< 100 Hz). Our model {{is based upon}} neurons that relay sensory inputs to the cortex. The bursts (2 - 6 spikes) are caused by an excitatory calcium channel, designed using circuits that capture the channel’s nonlinear dynamics. With sufficient priming, the channel opens quickly and closes slowly when the neuron’s voltage increases. Priming the channel requires lowering the neuron’s voltage for a sufficient period; thus, inhibitory inputs that can control the cell’s response mode.

40|$|Nonlinear {{dynamics}} {{can be used}} {{to identify}} relationships between different firing patterns, which play important roles in the information processing. The present study provides novel biological experimental findings regarding complex bifurcation scenarios from period- 1 bursting to period- 1 spiking with chaotic firing patterns. These bifurcations were found to be similar to those simulated using the Hindmarsh-Rose model across two separated chaotic regions. One chaotic region lay between period- 1 and period- 2 <b>burstings.</b> This region has not attracted much attention. The other region is a well-known comb-shaped chaotic region, and it appears after period- 2 bursting. After period- 2 bursting, the chaotic firings lay in a period-adding bifurcation scenario or in a period-doubling bifurcation cascade. The deterministic dynamics of the chaotic firing patterns were identified using a nonlinear prediction method. These results provided details regarding the processes and dynamics of bifurcation containing the chaotic bursting between period- 1 and period- 2 <b>burstings</b> and other chaotic firing patterns within the comb-shaped chaotic region.

40|$|Pollen {{germination}} {{may occur}} via the so-called germination pores or directly through the pollen {{wall at the}} site of contact with the stigma. In this study, we addressed what processes take place during pollen hydration (i. e. before tube emergence), in a species with extra-poral pollen germination, Arabidopsis thaliana. A T-DNA mutant population was screened by segregation distortion analysis. Histological and electron microscopy techniques were applied to examine the wild-type and mutant phenotypes. Within 1  h of the start of pollen hydration, an intine-like structure consisting of cellulose, callose and at least partly de-esterified pectin was formed at the pollen wall. Subsequently, this 'germination plaque' gradually extended and opened up to provide passage for the cytoplasm into the emerging pollen tube. <b>BURSTING</b> POLLEN (BUP) was identified as a gene essential for the correct organization of this plaque and the tip of the pollen tube. BUP encodes a novel Golgi-located glycosyltransferase related to the glycosyltransferase 4 (GT 4) subfamily which is conserved throughout the plant kingdom. Extra-poral pollen germination involves the development of a germination plaque and BUP defines the correct plastic-elastic properties of this plaque and the pollen tube tip by affecting pectin synthesis or delivery.

40|$|We {{consider}} an excitatory population of subthreshold Izhikevich neurons which cannot fire spontaneously without noise. As the coupling strength passes a threshold, individual neurons exhibit noise-induced <b>burstings.</b> This neuronal population has adaptive dynamic synaptic strengths {{governed by the}} spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). In the absence of STDP, stochastic burst synchronization (SBS) between noise-induced <b>burstings</b> of subthreshold neurons was previously found to occur over a large range of intermediate noise intensities. Here, we study the effect of additive STDP on the SBS by varying the noise intensity D in the Barabási-Albert scale-free network (SFN) for the case of symmetric preferential attachment. This type of SFN exhibits a power-law degree distribution, and hence it becomes an inhomogeneous one with a few "hubs" (i. e., super-connected nodes). Occurrence of a "Matthew" effect in synaptic plasticity is found to occur due to a positive feedback process. Good burst synchronization gets better via long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strengths, while bad burst synchronization gets worse via long-term depression (LTD). Consequently, a step-like rapid transition to SBS occurs by changing D, {{in contrast to a}} relatively smooth transition in the absence of STDP. In the presence of additive STDP, we also investigate the effects of network architecture on the SBS for a fixed D. Emergences of LTP and LTD of synaptic strengths are investigated in details via microscopic studies based on both the distributions of time delays between the burst onset times of the pre- and the post-synaptic neurons and the pair-correlations between the pre- and the post-synaptic IIBRs (instantaneous individual burst rates). Finally, a multiplicative STDP case (depending on states) is also investigated in comparison with the additive STDP case (independent of states).

40|$|A {{model of}} Edge Localized Modes (ELMS) in tokamaks is presented. The {{model of the}} L/H transition, {{which is based on}} the {{electric}} field bifurcation, is extended to Include the temporal evolution and the spatial structure. The existence of the electric field bifurcation infers a hysteresis curve between the plasma gradient (thermodynamic force) and the loss flux (flow). The time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation is formulated for the electric field development, in which a limit cycle solution due to this hysteresis is contained. The self-generated oscillation of edge density appears, associated with periodic bursts of the loss, under the condition of constant particle flux from the core. This is attributed to the small and frequent ELMy activity in H-mode. Periodic decay and re-establishment of the transport barrier occur. This oscillation appears near the L/H transition boundary in the parameter space. It is found that in H- and ELMy-H- states, the edge region forms an intermediate radial structure of diffusion coefficient (mesophase) between H-phase and L-phase. This is attributed to the transport barrier. Its radial structure is dictated by the ion shear viscosity. The diffusion Prandtl number, the ratio of the viscosity to the diffusivity, is found to determine the thickness of the barrier. Phase diagram of L-, ELMy-H, H- and L/H bistable-states is obtained on plasma parameter space. To consider other types of ELMs, transient responses to the perturbations of the flux from the core are studied in each phase. In low collisionallty plasma a sudden decrease of the flux can cause the transient bursting of a few ELMs before the L to H transition is completed. Large scale pulse from the core causes the transient return to L-phase and a giant burst occurs in high collisionality plasma. In ELMy-H state external oscillations cause the mode-locking and other complicated dynamics (such as period doubling, trebling, and intermittent bursts). The perturbation in the flux widens the parameter regime of the occurrence of <b>burstings...</b>|$|E
40|$|Sexual plant {{reproduction}} involves the deposition of pollen {{on top of}} the stigma, followed by pollen germination, pollen tube growth within the pistil and leading to delivery of the sperm cells to the embryo sac for fertilisation. One approach to study genes essential for this unique intercellular processes involves the screening of Arabidopsis T-DNA tagged populations and searching for lines with a non-Mendelian segregation of marker genes, due to reduced T-DNA transmission. The main focus of this thesis is the genetic, molecular and cellular characterization of a male gametophytic mutant, found in such a mutant population by segregation distortion analysis. The hemizygous mutant line TJ 995 showed a severe defect in male T-DNA transmission efficiency, with only 2 % of the mutant pollen tubes being able to achieve fertilization. No defect through the female gametophyte was found. TJ 995 showed bursting of the mutant pollen during pollen germination and pollen tube growth in vitro, and the mutant was called bursting pollen (bup/+). Molecular and genetic studies showed that the male gametophytic defect of bup/+ was due to the T-DNA insertional mutation of gene At 5 g 04480 (<b>BURSTING</b> POLLEN). BUP encodes a golgi-resident type II transmembrane protein showing similarity with family 1 glycosyl transferases, and appears to be strongly conserved through evolution. BUP and its Arabidopsis homologue BUP like (BPL) are both constitutively expressed at low levels in pollen and in vegetative tissues, but appear to have different functions within the male gametophyte. We hypothesize that BUP is involved in the synthesis of pectin present in the intine layer of the pollen (tube) wall and in sporophytic cell walls, and as such is important for the pollen wall and cell wall plasticity and strength...|$|R
