It is thought that decentralization can lower the requirements on communication for control, and formation-flying would simplify the oversight of large numbers of vehicles operating simultaneously. In this paper, we describe an algorithm that would enable multiple vehicles to maintain formation. Follower vehicles are equipped with a sensor that can determine a relative angular heading to the source of an intercepted acoustic signal from a leader vehicle. This sensor consists of two hydrophones separated by a fixed distance on the follower vehicles. Experiments were conducted to assess the ability of the two-hydrophone sensor to detemine <b>bearing</b> <b>angle</b> in the presence of propellor noise, relative motion with consequent Doppler shift, and a test application in a formation-flying scenario. The effect of using cross-correlation and matched filter signal processing procedures for determination of <b>bearing</b> <b>angle</b> were also compared. It was found that the two-hydrophone sensor could determine <b>bearing</b> <b>angle</b> in the presence of propellor noise, over distances ranging from 9 - 400 m considered in the experiments to an accuracy of approximately 4 o.

A widely adopted framework for research on the detection, avoidance, and interception of moving objects is the <b>bearing</b> <b>angle</b> model, according to which observers move so as to keep the <b>bearing</b> <b>angle</b> of the object constant for interception and varying for obstacle avoidance.

The purely feedback-driven CBA strategy has been contrasted with the strategy of predicting the eventual time and location of the future interception point. This study considers an intermediate anticipatory strategy of moving so as to produce a CBA a short duration into the future. Subjects controlled their speed of self-motion along a linear path through a simulated environment to intercept a moving target. When targets changed speed midway through the trial in Experiment 1, subjects abandoned an ineffective CBA strategy {{in favor of a}} strategy of antic-ipating the most likely change in target speed. In Experi-ment 2, targets followed paths of varying curvature. Behavior was inconsistent with both the CBA and the purely predictive strategy. To investigate the intermediate anticipatory strategy, human performance was compared with a model of interceptive behavior that, at each time-step t, produced the velocity adjustment that would mini-mize the change in <b>bearing</b> <b>angle</b> at time t?
