500|$|Based in London, {{where the}} company employs 10 tailors in three workshops, it also employs an {{additional}} 40 in a workshop in China where most of its entry-level, machine-sewn suits are made. All suits are made from British or Italian cloth, and are available either in [...] "machine grade" [...] or [...] "hand stitched". Suit prices vary based on the cloth that is used {{as well as the}} amount of hand-stitching that is done on the suit. The fully hand-made suits require around 50 hours of stitching, include a <b>basted</b> <b>fitting,</b> and conform to all the specifications for a bespoke suit suggested by the Savile Row Bespoke Association. Prices are kept lower than the average for bespoke tailors by requiring payment up-front. This allows Cad and the Dandy to negotiate discounts of 30% to 40% with their suppliers.|$|E
5000|$|Bespoke {{tailoring}} [...] is clothing made to {{an individual}} buyer's specifications by a tailor. Cad & the Dandy, a modern Savile Row tailor, describes true bespoke tailoring as requiring a full floating canvas, <b>basted</b> <b>fitting</b> and detailed hand finishing, which distinguishes bespoke from the much more common made-to-measure. David Reeves, NYC based English Bespoke tailor and founder of REEVES sees made to measure as a compromised mass retail product at odds with his luxury bespoke ethos.|$|E
