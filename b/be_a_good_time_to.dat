[...] 30,000 Arabs, mostly intellectuals {{and members of the}} social elite, had fled Palestine in the months {{following}} the approval of the partition plan, undermining the social infrastructure of Palestine. A 10 May 1948 Time magazine article states: [...] "Said one British official in Jerusalem last week: 'The whole effendi class has gone.

60|$|Luckily Hayward's letters came seldom, {{and in the}} {{intervals}} Philip settled down again to his industrious life. He had matriculated at the university and attended one or two courses of lectures. Kuno Fischer was then {{at the height of}} his fame and during the winter had been lecturing brilliantly on Schopenhauer. It was Philip's introduction to philosophy. He had a practical mind and moved uneasily amid the abstract; but he found an unexpected fascination in listening to metaphysical disquisitions; they made him breathless; it was a little like watching a tight-rope dancer doing perilous feats over an abyss; but it was very exciting. The pessimism of the subject attracted his youth; and he believed that the world he was about to enter was a place of pitiless woe and of darkness. That made him none the less eager to enter it; and when, in due course, Mrs. Carey, acting as the correspondent for his guardian's views, suggested that it was time for him to come back to England, he agreed with enthusiasm. He must make up his mind now what he meant to do. If he left Heidelberg at the end of July they could talk things over during August, and it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> make arrangements.|$|E
