Neville {{may have been in}} Waleran's service prior to this, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> secure appearance. For serving as butler, Neville received rents from the market dues at Pont-Audemer worth 100 shillings annually. He appears as a witness to a charter of Waleran's to the Abbey of Tiron, which is dated sometime before 1141. Neville witnessed ten other of Waleran's charters, ending in the 1150s.|$|E
5|$|Angelou's {{primary role}} in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas was stage performer, but in The Heart of a Woman she changes {{from someone who}} uses others' method of expression—the songs and dances of the African, Caribbean, and African-American oral tradition—to a writer. Angelou makes this {{decision}} for political reasons as she becomes more involved with the civil rights movement, and {{so that she can}} care for her son. For the first time in Angelou's autobiographies, she begins to think of herself as a writer and recounts her literary development. Angelou begins to identify with other Black women writers {{for the first time in}} The Heart of a Woman. She has been influenced by several writers since her childhood, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time she mentions female authors. Up to this point, her identification has been with male writers; her new affiliations with female writers is due to her emerging feminism.|$|E

25|$|There {{are quite}} a few guitar solos on this album. To be honest, I've never really classed myself as a lead player as such, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time I've sat down and seriously practiced lead work. I've been so {{involved}} in actually writing new material and coming up with song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly things that go on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't really been much room for guitar solos as such. The riffs we write, they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic within themselves. But I'm a great believer that less is definitely more. I love listening to all the shreddy, widdly stuff, but I have no interest in playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but this is definitely more melodic. Dare I say it, there {{are quite a}} lot of typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.|$|E
