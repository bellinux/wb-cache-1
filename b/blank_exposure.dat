40|$|The general aim of {{the current}} study was to {{investigate}} how perceived health risk of a chemical exposure and self-reported distress are related to perceived odor intensity and odor valence, symptoms, cognitive performance over time as well as reactions to <b>blank</b> <b>exposure.</b> Based on ratings of general distress, 20 participants constituted a relatively low distress group, and 20 other participants a relatively high distress group. Health risk perception was manipulated by providing positively and negatively biased information regarding n-butanol. Participants made repeated ratings of intensity, valence and symptoms and performed cognitive tasks while exposed to 4. 7 ppm n-butanol for 60 min (first 10 min were <b>blank</b> <b>exposure)</b> inside an exposure chamber. Ratings by the positive and negative bias groups suggest that the manipulation influenced perceived health risk of the exposure. The high distress group did not habituate to the exposure in terms of intensity when receiving negative information, but did so when receiving positive information. The high distress group, compared with the low distress group, rated the exposure as significantly more unpleasant, reported greater symptoms and performed worse on a cognitively demanding task over time. The positive bias group and high distress group rated <b>blank</b> <b>exposure</b> as more intense. The main findings suggest that relatively distressed individuals are negatively affected by exposures to a greater degree than non-distressed...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT—We {{aimed to}} clarify the {{relation}} between affec-tive valence and motivational direction by specifying how central and peripheral components of extension move-ments are altered according to specific unpleasant affective states. As predicted, premotor reaction time was quicker for extension movements initiated during exposure to at-tack than for extension movements initiated during ex-posure to all other valence categories (mutilation, erotic couples, opposite-sex nudes, neutral humans, household objects, <b>blank).</b> <b>Exposure</b> to erotic couples and mutilations yielded greater peak force than exposure to images of attack, neutral humans, and household objects. Finally, motor reaction timeandpeakelectromyographic amplitude were not altered by valence. These findings indicate that unpleasant states do not unilaterally prime withdrawa...|$|E
40|$|The {{simple and}} {{cost-effective}} microfabrication method of photosensitive glass (PSG) using metal patterning and <b>blank</b> <b>exposure</b> was proposed. Conventional photolithography for micromachining of PSG needs a costly quartz mask which has high transmittance as an optical property. However, {{in this study}} the process was improved through the combination of micro-patterned Ti thin film and blank UV exposure without quartz mask. The effect of UV exposure {{time as well as}} the DHF etching condition was investigated. UV exposure test was performed within the range from 3 min to 9 min. The color and etch result of PSG exposed for 5 min were the most clear and effective to etch more precisely, respectively. The etching results of PSG in diluted hydrofluoric acid (DHF) with a concentration of 5, 10, 15 vol % were compared. The effect on the side etch was insignificant while the etch rate was proportional as the concentration increased. 10 vol% DHF results not only high etch rate of 75 µm/min also lower side etch value after PSG etching. This method facilitates the microfabrication of PSG with various patterns and high aspect ratio for applying to advance...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric inputs of soluble iron (Fe) to {{the global}} ocean are an {{important}} factor determining marine primary productivity and nitrogen fixation. To investigate soluble aerosol Fe and fractional Fe solubility, marine aerosol sampling has been conducted {{from a number of}} platforms including aerosol towers, ship and buoy platforms. A number of these studies have used commercially available high-volume aerosol samplers to collect aerosols from large volumes of air. These samplers are attractive for sampling air from low Fe air masses since they can rapidly concentrate large volumes improving detection limits. Here we investigate the use of a high-volume sampler from the Cape Grim Baseline Air Pollution Station (CGBAPS), Tasmania, Australia to sample aerosol Fe from baseline Southern Ocean air-masses. The study followed the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standard for the sampling of ambient air using high-volume sampler, and the recommendations and protocols from GEOTRACES community for sampling, sample preparation and digestion of trace element aerosols. Analysis and inspection of <b>exposure</b> <b>blank</b> (one month <b>exposure)</b> filters for Fe, and other metals, revealed significant contamination resulting from passive deposition of local soil, plants and insects. The results of the study suggest that high-volume aerosol samplers may not be suitable for low concentration air masses over the Southern Ocean without some mechanism to hermetically seal the sampler when the baseline sampling criteria are not met...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} detailed {{investigation of}} UV inscribed fibre grating based devices and novel {{developments in the}} applications of such devices in optical sensing and fibre laser systems. The major contribution of this PhD programme includes the systematic study on fabrication, spectral characteristics and applications {{of different types of}} UV written in-fibre gratings such as Type I and IA Fibre Bragg Gratings (FBGs), Chirped Fibre Bragg Gratings (CFBGs) and Tilted Fibre Gratings (TFGs) with small, large and 45 º tilted structures inscribed in normal silica fibre. Three fabrication techniques including holographic, phase-mask and <b>blank</b> beam <b>exposure</b> scanning, which were employed to fabricate a range of gratings in standard single mode fibre, are fully discussed. The thesis reports the creation of smart structures with self-sensing capability by embedding FBG-array sensors in Al matrix composite. In another part of this study, we have demonstrated the particular significant improvements made in sensitising standard FBGs to the chemical surrounding medium by inducing microstructure to the grating by femtosecond (fs) patterning assisted chemical etching technique. Also, a major work is presented for the investigation on the structures, inscription methods and spectral Polarisation Dependent Loss (PDL) and thermal characteristics of different angle TFGs. Finally, a very novel application in realising stable single polarisation and multiwavelength switchable Erbium Doped Fibre Lasers (EDFLs) using intracavity polarisation selective filters based on TFG devices with tilted structures at small, large and exact 45 ° angles forms another important contribution of this thesis.

40|$|Objective　To {{observe the}} injury to liver cells, and to {{investigate}} the changes in nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) in the liver tissue after exposure to positive ten acceleration (+ 10 Gz). Methods　Twenty-four adult male Wistar rats {{were randomly assigned to}} four groups: <b>blank</b> control, <b>exposure</b> groups A, B, and C. The rats of three exposure groups were subjected to centrifugal force of + 10 Gz for 0. 5, 24, and 48 h respectively, which was carried out in an Air Force Institute of Aviation Medicine. Plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were determined. Liver tissue was harvested for immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting was performed for expression of NF-κB. Results　After + 10 Gz exposure, rats of the group A showed shaggy hair, apathetic to food, and laid still, while group B rats showed shaggy hair, took a little food with lowering of activity level. The rats in group C showed normal activities. Both the levels of serum AST and ALT were elevated, and they were higher in group B than that of groups A and C (P 0. 05). Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining showed that the NF-κB expression levels were significantly higher in exposure groups than in control group (P 0. 05). Immunohistochemical examination revealed NF-κBpositive products were localized predominantly in the hepatocytes, and also in the inflammatory cells and Kupffer cells. These products could be divided into three types: cytosolic type, karyotype, and nuclear-cytoplasm type, and they existed alone or in combination. Conclusion　Exposure to + 10 Gz, especially in the early stage, acts as a stress to induce the activation of NF-κB, suggesting that NF-κB {{plays an important role in}} the cascade reactions and adaptation to the acceleration stress.

40|$|In 1980 Place and Gilmore (J. of Abnormal Psychol., 89 (3), 409 - 418) {{concluded}} that a perceptual deficit in schizophrenia may be expressed as a failure to organize information {{at an early stage}} of processing. Yet, Place & Gilmore's findings may be questioned on two points. First, in light of the symptomotology involved in schizophrenia, Place and Gilmore's (1980) findings raise {{the question of whether the}} deficit was the result of schizophrenic symptomotology (i. e. clinical state) or a result of an underlying vulnerability to schizophrenia (i. e. trait). The second point of question involves the procedure utilized by Place & Gilmore (1980) and later replicated by Wells & Leventhal (1984). The utilization of a 500 ms <b>blank</b> <b>exposure</b> following the tachistoscopic target presentation raises the possibility of a masking by light effect on performance, a possibility that was not taken into account by either Place & Gilmore (1980) or Wells & Leventhal (1984). In an attempt to eliminate these confounding variables, the present proposed study will compare the performance of persons who have averted the clinical syndrome but are hypothetically vulnerable to schizophrenia (schizotypics), as determined by the 2 - 7 - 8 MMPI profile, to the performance of individuals with normal MMPI profiles on a modified version of the Place & Gilmore (1980) task. The modified version of the task involves the added condition of "without the 500 ms blank exposure". In addition to the 2 - 7 - 8 and "inflation-free" groups, a 4 - 9 "psychiatric control" group and an additional schizotypic 8 - 9 MMPI, group will be utilized. All subjects will receive both conditions (with versus without the blank light exposure). Differences in mean group line counting performance will be analyzed in a four-way ANOVA with two repeated measures. It is hypothesized that the schizotypics will more accurately perform the line-counting task than both the "inflation free" and 4 - 9 groups in the condition that replicates Place & Gilmore (1980). However, a masking effect is expected to be manifested by more accurate line counting overall in the "no light" condition. Results will be analyzed in reference to the perceptual grouping literature (Treisman, 1982) the masking by light literature (Breitmeyer, 1984) and the literature on vulnerability to schizophrenia (Zubin & Spring, 1977).

40|$|Context. The first {{unidentified}} {{very high}} energy gamma ray source (TeV J 2032 + 4130) in the Cygnus region {{has been the}} subject of intensive search for a counterpart source at other wavelengths. In particular, observations in radio and X-rays are important to trace a population of non-thermal electrons. Aims. A deep (≈ 50 ksec) exposure of TeV J 2032 + 4130 with XMM-Newton has been obtained. The large collection area and the field of view of the X-ray telescopes on-board of XMM-Newton allow to search for faint extended X-ray emission possibly linked to TeV J 2032 + 4130. Methods. The contribution of point sources to the observed X-ray emission from TeV J 2032 + 4130 is subtracted from the data. The point-source subtracted X-ray data are analyzed using <b>blank</b> sky <b>exposures</b> and regions adjacent to the position of TeV J 2032 + 4130 in the field of view covered by the XMM-Newton telescopes to search for diffuse X-ray emission. Results. An extended X-ray emission region with a full width half maximum (FWHM) size of ≈ 12 arc min is found. The centroid of the emission is co-located with the position of TeV J 2032 + 4130. The angular extension of the X-ray emission region is slightly smaller than the angular size of TeV J 2032 + 4130 (FWHM= 14 ± 3 arc min). The energy spectrum of the emission coinciding with the position and extension of TeV J 2032 + 4130 can be modeled by a power-law model with a photon indexΓ= 1. 5 ± 0. 2 stat ± 0. 3 sys and an energy flux integrated between 2 and 10 keV of f 2 − 10 keV ≈ 7 · 10 − 13 ergs/(cm 2 s) which is lower than the very high energy gamma-ra...|$|R
