40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the consequences of}} oil price volatility on {{the growth of the}} Nigerian economy within the period 1970 to 2010. Using quaterly data and employing the VAR methodology, the study finds that of the six variables employed, oil price volatility impacted directly on real government expenditure, real exchange rate and real import, while impacting on real GDP, real money supply and inflation through other variables, notably real government expenditure. This implies that oil price changes determines government expenditure level, which in turn determines the growth of the Nigerian economy. This result seems to reflect the dominant role of government in Nigeria. Considering the destabilizing effects of oil price fluctuations on economic activity and government spending in Nigeria, the study makes some recommendations. Some of these include; fiscal prudence, reform in <b>budgetary</b> <b>operations,</b> export diversification, revival of the non-oil sector of the economy, accountability and corporate governance...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{reform in}} public financial management in small, resource-constrained economies {{such as the}} Pacific island countries (PICs). It describes the efforts undertaken by PICs {{in the past and}} assesses their results. A principal conclusion is that reform in public financial management needs to be defined against the capacity of countries to sustain it at the national level. This requires a careful definition of priorities for action and the determination of appropriate pacing and sequencing of reform. In this decision, achievement of the imperatives of expenditure control and sustainability of deficits is typically more important than exploitation of the scope for efficiency gains promised by "cutting edge" public financial management systems.

40|$|For {{the republics}} of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) as for many other {{transition}} economies, {{an important step in}} introducing a more market-oriented system was the restructuring of their budget systems. This paper reviews and evaluates the process of budget system reform during the transition period extending from the time they emerged from the collapse of the SFRY in 1989 until the end of 2002. For at least a decade of this period, the Fiscal Affairs Department of the IMF has been providing technical assistance (TA) to these countries to facilitate such reforms. Based on the material generated by this effort, the authors offer a review of the progress made and an assessment of the reform elements still to be completed. Given that the former Yugoslav republics all commenced the reform process with the same institutions, this paper offers a unique opportunity to analyze the critical elements in successful budget system reform. An attempt is made to explain the varying degrees of success experienced by different countries, and a reform agenda is suggested to guide future TA.
