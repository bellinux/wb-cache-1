Chalukyan temples were, almost always, built facing the east.|$|E

5|$|After his {{position}} as sultan of Egypt and emir of Damascus was secured, Al-Adil started an extensive rebuilding programme of the citadel. Between 1203 and 1216, the old fortifications were razed and a larger castle was built at the same location, incorporating parts of the old Seljuq citadel. The lower Ayyubid princes were each required to finance and <b>build</b> <b>one</b> of the large towers of the citadel. Several of Al-Adil's Ayyubid successors rebuilt many of the administrative and domestic structures inside the citadel, including residences, palaces, and a pool. As-Salih Ayyub was the only successor who also modified the defences.|$|E

5|$|The Olympic {{program was}} {{adjusted}} {{from that of}} the 1956 Winter Olympics omitting bobsleigh and adding a sport new to Olympic competition, men's biathlon. The sport of military patrol, similar to biathlon, had previously been a medal sport in 1924 and a demonstration sport in 1928, 1936 and 1948. The removal of bobsleigh from the Olympic program was by necessity; the site for the 1960 Games lacked a bobsleigh track and the funds were not available to <b>build</b> <b>one.</b> Despite only five nations confirming their intention to take part, the removal of the event from the program garnered international criticism. Both men and women competed at the 1960 Games, with women taking part in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, and speed skating.|$|E
5|$|In 1789, Antoine Lavoisier {{published}} {{a list of}} 33 chemical elements, grouping them into gases, metals, nonmetals, and earths. Chemists spent the following century searching for a more precise classification scheme. In 1829, Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner observed {{that many of the}} elements could be grouped into triads based on their chemical properties. Lithium, sodium, and potassium, for example, were grouped together in a triad as soft, reactive metals. Döbereiner also observed that, when arranged by atomic weight, the second member of each triad was roughly the average of the first and the third; this became known as the Law of Triads. German chemist Leopold Gmelin worked with this system, and by 1843 he had identified ten triads, three groups of four, and one group of five. Jean-Baptiste Dumas published work in 1857 describing relationships between various groups of metals. Although various chemists were able to identify relationships between small groups of elements, they had yet to <b>build</b> <b>one</b> scheme that encompassed them all.|$|E
5|$|Kristins Hall is {{an arena}} located at Stampesletta in Lillehammer, Norway. It consist of an ice rink, a {{combined}} handball and floorball court, and a curling rink. The venue, {{owned and operated}} by the Lillehammer Municipality, opened in 1988 and cost 65 million Norwegian krone (NOK) to <b>build.</b> <b>One</b> of the motivations for its construction was to help Lillehammer's bid to be selected as the host of the 1994 Winter Olympics. The ice rink has a capacity for 3,194 spectators and is the home rink of GET-ligaen hockey club Lillehammer IK. Kristins Hall is located next to the larger Håkons Hall, which opened in 1993. During the 1994 Winter Olympics, Kristins Hall was a training rink, and subsequently hosted the ice sledge hockey tournament at the 1994 Winter Paralympics. The venue also co-hosted Group B of the 1989 World Ice Hockey Championships.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Romney Depot to Depot Valley brought {{residential}} development on the hilltops {{to the west and}} east of Valley. On September27, 1911, George Edward Harmison (1863–1916) conducted a public auction of Valley View farm's fields atop Yellow Banks overlooking the South Branch Potomac River. The land was located atop the hill to the west of Valley. Harmison subdivided the fields into lots, and the planned development was known as the Valley View Addition to Romney. Harmison sold 21 of the land lots at the auction, and several lots were sold privately. A free lot was given to J.H. Newhouse, and Harmison set aside two lots on a bluff for the site of a future hospital, which he planned to deed to any entity willing to <b>build</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
