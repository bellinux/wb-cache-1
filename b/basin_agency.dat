Each agency has a Board, a user assembly and a council to ensure broad participation by various stakeholders in its decision-making process, both in planning and operations. There are a total of 15 <b>Basin</b> <b>Agencies</b> in Spain for rivers that flow through more than one autonomous community.

30|$|The {{soil erosion}} {{assessment}} {{depends upon the}} regional characteristics of the area, namely climate, soil condition, land use/land cover, topography, and lithology. To prepare maps of these characteristics, the data {{used in this study}} are collected from various sources. The Landsat 8 OLI image with a resolution of 30 m was downloaded from Earth Explorer dated June 21, 2015. It has been properly used for the spectral index method. The digital elevation model (DEM) of 30  m resolution of the study area was downloaded from ASTER GDEM. It was used to generate topographic parameters (slope, hydrographic network). The geological map (1 : 500, 000) of Rabat was used to digitize geological formations. The monthly and annual rainfall data from 1985 to 2014 were obtained from the Hydraulic <b>Basin</b> <b>Agency</b> of Oum Er Rbia and Tadla-Azilal Regional Directorate of Water and Forests. The topsoil samples were collected over 22 locations within the study watershed in order to determine soil texture and organic matter content. The soil texture was determined by the Robinson pipette method, and the soil EC was determined from the suspension prepared by adding 50  ml de-ionized water to 10  g of sediment and shaking for 30  min. The topographic parameters of the watershed and the thematic factor maps were extracted using ArcGIS 10.2 software.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{describe}} and analyze river basin {{management in the}} Guadalquivir River Basin in Spain. The Guadalquivir river flows westerly across southern Spain, with nearly all of its 57, 017 km 2 drainage area within the region of Andalusia. Water management issues in this semi-arid, heavily agricultural, but rapidly urbanizing region include drought exposure, water allocation, water quality, and in some areas, groundwater overdraft. A river <b>basin</b> <b>agency</b> (Confederacion Hidrografica del Guadalquivir, or CH Guadalquivir) has existed within the basin since 1927, but its responsibilities have changed substantially over its history. For much of its life, CH Guadalquivir's mission was water supply augmentation through construction and operation of reservoirs, primarily to support irrigation, under central government direction with little provision for water user participation. Following the Spanish political system's transformation and Spain's accession to the European Union, water law and policy changes greatly expanded CH Guadalquivir's responsibilities and restructured it to incorporate representation of some basin stakeholders. Although the basin agency's accomplishments in reservoir construction have been prodigious, its record of performance with respect to its newer responsibilities has been mixed, as have perceptions of its openness and responsiveness to basin interests other than irrigators.

40|$|Abstract—Oases {{are complex}} and fragile agro-ecosystems. They have always existed in environments {{characterized}} by an arid climate, scarcity of rainfall, high temperatures and high evaporation. These palms have grown up despite {{the severity of the}} physical characteristics thanks to the water's existence and irrigation practice. The oases are generally spread along non-perennial rivers (wadis), shallow water table or deep artesian groundwater. However, the sustainability of oasis system is threatened by water scarcity and declining of water table levels particularly in arid areas. Located in the southern east area of Morocco, Tafilalet plain encompasses one of the largest palm groves in the kingdom. In recent years, this area has become increasingly threatened by water shortage and has seen a sharp deterioration under the effect of several combined anthropogenic and climatic factors. The Bayoud disease, successive years of drought, Hassan Addakhil dam construction etc are all factors that have affected both water and phoenicicole heritage of the area. The objective {{of this study is to}} understand the interaction between qualitative and quantitative degradation of groundwater resources, and the palm grove dynamics, while reviewing the assumption that groundwater resources contribute in a direct way to the conservation of this oasis agroecosystem. A historical analysis tracing both the oasis dynamics and the groundwater evolution has been established. Data were collected from satellite images, surveys with different actors (farmers, Regional Office for Agricultural Development, <b>Basin</b> <b>agency</b> [...] .). They were complemented by a synthesis of numerous technical reports in the area. The results showed that within 40 years, the thickness of the groundwater table has dropped in 50 %. Along with this, there has been a downsizing of date palm by 50 %. Areas with higher groundwater level were the least affected by the downsizing. So we can say that the shallow groundwater contribute significantly and directly to the water supply of date palm through its root system, and largely ensures the oasis ecosystem sustainability.

40|$|The Augmented Fish Health Monitoring Project (Project) had its origin, in the mid- 1980 's, in {{perceived}} differences or {{inconsistencies in}} fish disease detection, diagnosis and control capabilities between the five conservation agencies rearing and releasing anadromous salmonids for fishery resource management and mitigation purposes in the Columbia River <b>basin.</b> <b>Agency</b> fish health programs varied greatly. Some agencies had personnel, equipment and funding to frequently monitor the {{health status of}} both juvenile production fish and adult salmon or steelhead trout {{at the time of}} spawning. Other agencies had much smaller programs and limited resources. These differences became better understood when the Pacific Northwest Fish Health Protection Committee developed its Model Fish Health Protection Program including recommendations for standard fish disease detection procedures. Even though some agencies could not immediately attain the goals set by the Model Program it was unanimously adopted as a desirable objective. Shortly thereafter, a multi-party planning group was assembled to help the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) find ways to improve agency fish health programs and implement measures under the Fish and Wildlife Program of the Northwest Power Planning Council. The planning group assessed existing agency fish health monitoring capabilities, agreed upon satisfactory levels of capability to detect and identify important fish pathogens, and designed a five-year project establishing comparable fish health monitoring capability in each agency. It was strongly believed that such a project would improve the health and quality of the millions of hatchery fish released annually in the Columbia River basin and improve interagency communications and disease control coordination. During 1986 and 1987 BPA individually negotiated five separate contracts with the fishery agencies to standardize fish health monitoring, develop a common data collection and reporting format, evaluate and monitor hatchery water supplies, improve communications and coordination, and provide a mechanism for periodic review. The contract with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service was approved on May 31, 1987, the last of the five inter-agency agreements to be signed. This did not delay Service participation with the other agencies because the Service already had many elements of the Project in place under its existing Service-wide fish health policy and implementation plan, The Service fully participated in the Project from mid- 1987 through mid- 1992. This completion report describes some of the many accomplishments under each of the objectives, benefits accruing from the Project, elements to be sustained by the Service after the Project ended, and Project that were not completed or that pointed out new work that needs to be done...|$|E
