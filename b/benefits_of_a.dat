5|$|In 1998, a {{rotavirus}} vaccine was licensed {{for use in}} the United States. Clinical {{trials in}} the United States, Finland, and Venezuela had found it to be 80 to 100% effective at preventing severe diarrhoea caused by rotavirus A, and researchers had detected no statistically significant serious adverse effects. The manufacturer, however, withdrew it from the market in 1999, after it was discovered that the vaccine may have contributed to an increased risk for intussusception, a type of bowel obstruction, in one of every 12,000 vaccinated infants. The experience provoked intense debate about the relative risks and <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rotavirus vaccine.|$|E

Gary Baise, the Republican challenger to Gerry Connolly's Fairfax County Board of Supervisors Chairmanship, represented Tysons Tunnel. By 2010, Tysons Tunnel, Inc. ceased operations.|$|E
5|$|Simply disclaiming a {{beneficial}} interest does not fall within Section 53(1)(c), as in Re Paradise Motor Co. Nominating somebody to receive <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pension fund should the pensioner die {{is also not}} a valid disposition, as in Re Danish Bacon Co Ltd Staff Pension Fund, and neither is nominating a beneficiary under a life insurance policy, as in Gold v Hill. Where a beneficiary declares he is holding the property on behalf of another, {{this would be the}} creation of a sub-trust and not subject to specific formalities. However, under Grainge v Wilberforce, such a sub-trust will only be held to be valid if there is some difference between the trust and sub-trust, and if the trustee-beneficiary has some duties to perform.|$|E

5|$|The cooking of {{the area}} {{is not to be}} {{confused}} with the Mediterranean diet, made popular because of the apparent health <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> diet rich in olive oil, wheat and other grains, fruits, vegetables, and a certain amount of seafood, but low in meat and dairy products.

25|$|Situation {{awareness}} {{appears in}} the technical literature as early as 1983, when describing the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prototype touch-screen navigation display. During the early 1980s, integrated “vertical-situation” and “horizontal-situation” displays were being developed for commercial aircraft to replace multiple electro-mechanical instruments. Integrated situation displays combined the information from several instruments enabling more efficient access to critical flight parameters, thereby improving situational awareness and reducing pilot workload.|$|E
