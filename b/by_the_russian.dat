5|$|The Russian {{influence}} gradually penetrated {{into the}} region by the early 19th century.

However, Russia returned it to Persia by the 1813 Treaty of Gulistan. On 13 April 1827, during the Russo-Persian War (1826–28), Etchmiadzin was captured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> General Ivan Paskevich's troops without fight and was formally annexed by Russia, with the Persian-controlled parts of Armenia, roughly corresponding to {{the territory of the}} modern Republic of Armenia (also known as Eastern Armenia), according to the 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay.|$|E
