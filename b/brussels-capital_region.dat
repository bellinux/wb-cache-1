5|$|Actual {{purification}} of {{the waste}} water from the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region</b> was not completed until the 21st century, when two purification stations were built. The south station treats refuse water from 360,000 inhabitants, which is about {{one third of the}} polluted water, and lies on the border of Anderlecht and Forest. The north station, completed in March 2007, is located near the border of the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region,</b> between the Senne and the Charleroi-Willebroek Canal, near Buda Bridge. A portion of the cost was footed by the Flemish Government, as 7 of the adjacent municipalities lie within the Flemish Region. This station is capable of treating the water of 1,100,000 inhabitants and should finally be capable of fully purifying the Senne, which had long caused much of the pollution of the Scheldt river.|$|E
5|$|I: Due to Belgium's complex federal {{structure}} the Parliament of the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region</b> (Brussels Hoofdstedelijk Parlement / Parlement de la Région de Bruxelles-Capitale) (89, regional assembly), Flemish Parliament (Vlaams Parlement) (124, regional and community assembly), the Walloon Parliament (Parlement wallon) (75, regional assembly), the Parliament of the French Community (Parlement de la Communauté française) (94, community assembly) and the Parliament of the German-speaking Community (Parlament der Deutschsprachigen Gemeinschaft) (25, community assembly) have competences in federal legislation that affects their interests.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, {{plans were}} made to cover the Senne along its entire course within the greater Brussels area, which had grown {{significantly}} since the covering of the 19th century. The course of the Senne was changed to the downtown's peripheral boulevards. In 1976, the disused tunnels were converted into the north-south axis of Brussels' underground tram system, the premetro. Actual purification of the waste water from the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region</b> was not completed until March 2007, when two treatment stations were built, thus finally cleansing the Senne after centuries of problems.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1993 State Reform, the {{environment}} is a regional responsibility, with the Flemish, Walloon and <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Regions</b> responsible for environmental matters in their respective territories.

5000|$|On October 14, 2012, Belgium {{utilized}} Smartmatic’s {{technology and}} managed services {{to carry out}} regional elections in 153 communes in the Flanders and <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>regions.</b> The Flemish government stated [...] "the Venezuelan Smartmatic fails for technical issues and demands that the system, which cost 40 million euros, will be improved by 2014". There were nearly 2,000 incidents with 25% of them being technical issues, with some instances of voters casting a ballot twice for a candidate by quickly pressing the screen. Following the election, Flanders refused to pay 16.5% of the initial agreed payment due to Smartmatic's failure.|$|R
5000|$|In certain {{municipalities}} {{along the}} border with the Walloon and the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>regions,</b> French-speakers enjoy [...] "language facilities". These cover rights such as to receive official documentation in their own tongue. Similar facilities are enjoyed by Dutch-speakers in some Walloon municipalities bordering the Flemish Region, by German-speakers in two municipalities in the French language area of the Walloon Region, and by French-speakers in the territory of the German-speaking community.The geographical limitations of the communities require the French Community to ensure Dutch basic education in its municipalities with facilities for speakers of Dutch, and the Flemish Community to finance French schools in its municipalities with facilities.|$|R
5|$|In 1930, for the country's centennial, {{the venue}} was inaugurated as the Jubilee Stadium with an {{unofficial}} match between Belgium and the Netherlands. At that time, the stadium had {{a capacity of}} 75,000. In 1946, it was renamed Heysel Stadium after its city quarter. This new name became associated with the tragedy preceding the 1985 European Cup final between Juventus and Liverpool; 39 spectators died after riots in the then antiquated building. Three years after the disaster, plans were unveiled for a renovation; in 1995, {{after two years of}} work, the modernised stadium was named after the late King Baudouin. In May 2013, the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region</b> announced that the King Baudouin Stadium would be replaced by Eurostadium, elsewhere on the Heysel Plateau; two years later, a 2019 date was set for the stadium's completion.|$|E

40|$|Regions are {{increasingly}} becoming a main engine {{of globalization and}} are playing a more and more important role in economic development policies. As a consequence, regional authorities must be very attentive to the competitiveness of their region. In a {{first part of the}} paper, some main economic European indicators are analyzed for the traditional industrial regions and metropolitan areas in order to put forward the real position of the Walloon as well as <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>regions.</b> As other European regions, Walloon and Brussels policy-makers have implemented a new industrial policy based on the promotion and the support of competitiveness clusters. The main characteristics of this policy and of Its implementation as well as its forces and weaknesses are reviewed {{in the second part of}} the paper. © De Boeck Université.

40|$|ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: A problem {{repeatedly}} {{reported in}} birth certificate data {{is the presence}} of missing data. In 2008, a Centre for Perinatal Epidemiology was created inter alia to assist the Health Departments of <b>Brussels-Capital</b> City <b>Region</b> to check birth certificates. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the changes brought by the Centre in terms of completeness of data registration for the entire population and according to immigration status. METHODS: Birth certificates from the birth registry of 2008 and 2009 of Brussels were considered. We evaluated the initial missing information in January 2008 (baseline situation) and the corresponding rate at the end of 2008 after oral and written information had been given to the city civil servants and health providers. The data were evaluated again at the end of 2009 where no reinforcement rules were adopted. We also measured residual missing data after correction in socio-economic and medical data, for the entire population and according to maternal nationality of origin. Changes in registration of stillbirths were estimated by comparison to 2007 baseline data, and all multiple births were checked for complete identification of pairs. RESULTS: Missing information initially accounted for 64. 0 %, 20. 8 % and 19. 5 % of certificates in January 2008, December 2008, and 2009 respectively. After correction with lists sent back to the hospitals or city offices, the mean residual missing data rate was 2. 1 % in 2008 and 0. 8 % in 2009. Education level and employment status were missing more often in immigrant mothers compared to Belgian natives both in 2008 and 2009. Mothers from Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest missing rate of socio-economic data. The stillbirth rate increased from 4. 6 [per mille sign] in 2007 to 8. 2 [per mille sign] in 2009. All twin pairs were identified, but early loss of a co-twin before 22 weeks was rarely reported. CONCLUSIONS: Reinforcement of data collection was associated with a decrease of missing information. The residual missing data rate was very low. The stillbirth rate was also improved but the early loss of a co-twin before 22 weeks seems to remain underreported.

25|$|During {{the third}} state reform in 1988 and 1989, under Prime Minister Wilfried Martens, the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region</b> was {{established}} {{with its own}} regional institutions, as well as Dutch and French institutions for community matters. The <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region</b> remained limited to 19 municipalities. Other changes included that the competencies of the Communities and Regions were expanded. One notable responsibility that {{was transferred to the}} Communities during the third state reform was education.|$|E
25|$|After the {{creation}} of the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region,</b> the Brussels Agglomeration was never formally abolished, although it no longer has a purpose.|$|E
25|$|The French Community and the Flemish Community {{exercise}} their powers in Brussels through two community-specific public authorities: the French Community Commission (French: Commission communautaire française or COCOF) and the Flemish Community Commission (Dutch: Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie or VGC). These two bodies each have an assembly {{composed of the}} members of each linguistic group of the Parliament of the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region.</b> They also have a board composed of the ministers and secretaries of state of each linguistic group in the Government of the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region.</b>|$|E
25|$|A stylized Yellow Iris is {{the symbol}} of Brussels, since historically, the {{important}} Saint Gaugericus Island was carpeted in them. The iris symbol is now the sole feature on {{the flag of the}} <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1989, the {{compromise}} between these conceptions {{gave rise to}} the official creation of the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region,</b> and influenced the jurisdictions it was given. It was given its own government, including its own parliament, with 11 seats of the 75 total reserved for Dutch-speakers. This was increased in 2004 to 17 of 89 seats, roughly a fifth of the total. As a concession to the Flemings, of the four ministers of the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>region,</b> half must be Flemish, and of the three more junior Secretaries of State, at least one must be Flemish. The Minister-President is in practice always a francophone, so the cabinet of the Region has 5 French-speaking and 3 Dutch-speaking members.|$|E
25|$|The forest {{lies in the}} Flemish {{municipalities}} of Sint-Genesius-Rode, Hoeilaart, Overijse, and Tervuren, in the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region</b> {{municipalities of}} Uccle, Watermael-Boitsfort, Auderghem, and Woluwe-Saint-Pierre, and in the Walloon towns of La Hulpe and Waterloo. Thus, it stretches out over the three Belgian Regions.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{what its}} name suggests, the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region</b> {{is not the}} capital of Belgium in itself. Article 194 of the Belgian Constitution {{establishes}} that the capital of Belgium is the City of Brussels, the municipality within the capital region that once was the city's core.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{creation}} of the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region,</b> regional competences in the 19 municipalities were performed by the Brussels Agglomeration. The Brussels Agglomeration was an administrative division established in 1971. This decentralised administrative public body also assumed jurisdiction over areas which, elsewhere in Belgium, were exercised by municipalities or provinces.|$|E
25|$|The 19 {{municipalities}} (communes) of the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region</b> {{are political}} subdivisions with individual responsibilities for {{the handling of}} local level duties, such as law enforcement and the upkeep of schools and roads within its borders. Municipal administration is also conducted by a mayor, a council, and an executive.|$|E
25|$|The Flemish Community covers {{both the}} Flemish Region and, {{together}} with the French Community, the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region.</b> Brussels, an enclave within the province of Flemish Brabant, is not divided into any province nor is it part of any. It coincides with the Arrondissement of Brussels-Capital and includes 19 municipalities.|$|E
25|$|The {{boundaries}} of the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region</b> were determined from the 1947 language census data. This {{was the last time}} that some municipalities were converted from a monolingual Dutch into a bilingual municipality, and were joined with the Brussels agglomeration. The suggestive nature of the questions led massive protest in Flanders (especially around Brussels), causing it to be unlikely to ever have language-related census data again in Belgium. The result is that the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>region</b> is now a lot smaller than the French influence around the capital, and that there's no place in Brussels for important infrastructure. Enlarging the territory of Brussels could potentially give it around 1.5million inhabitants, an airport, a bigger forest, and bring the Brussels Ringroad on Brussels territory. A large and independent status may help Brussels in its claim as the capital of the EU. However, this is highly unlikely to happen in the near future.|$|E
25|$|The Flemish Government {{has its own}} local {{institutions}} in the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region,</b> being the Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie (VGC), and its municipal antennae (Gemeenschapscentra, community centres for the Flemish community in Brussels). These institutions are independent from the educational, cultural and social institutions that depend directly on the Flemish Government. They exert, among others, all those cultural competences that outside Brussels fall under the provinces.|$|E
25|$|Total Dutch {{speakers}} are 6.23million, {{concentrated in}} the northern Flanders region, while French speakers number 3.32million in Wallonia and an estimated 870,000 (or 85%) in the officially bilingual <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region.</b> The German-speaking Community {{is made up of}} 73,000 people in the east of the Walloon Region; around 10,000 German and 60,000 Belgian nationals are speakers of German. Roughly 23,000 more German speakers live in municipalities near the official Community.|$|E
25|$|The censuses {{on the use}} of {{languages}} in the municipalities of the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region</b> have shown that by 1947 French was becoming the most spoken language. However, in 1947, the percentage of residents declaring themselves bilingual was 45%, the percentage of monolingual Dutch-speakers was 9% and the percentage of monolingual French-speakers was 38%. In practice the bilingual citizens were most of the time bilingual Flemings. They were nevertheless recorded as bilinguals and not as Dutch-speakers.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region</b> {{was formed}} on 18 June 1989, after a {{constitutional}} reform in 1988. It has bilingual status {{and it is}} one of the three federal regions of Belgium, along with Flanders and Wallonia. The yellow iris is the emblem of the region (referring to the presence of these flowers on the original site of the city) and a stylized version in shown on the official flag of the Brussels region.|$|E
25|$|It is a class X fire {{department}} and the largest fire service in Belgium, in terms of annual operations, equipment and personnel. It has 9 fire stations, spread over the entire <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region,</b> and employs about 1,000 professional firefighters. As well as preventing and fighting fires, SIAMU also provides emergency medical care services in Brussels via its centralised 100 number (and the single 112 emergency number for the 27 countries of the European Union). It is bilingual (French-Dutch).|$|E
25|$|The {{overlapping}} {{boundaries of}} the Regions and Communities have created two notable peculiarities: {{the territory of the}} <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region</b> (which came into existence nearly a decade after the other regions) is included in both the Flemish and French Communities, and the territory of the German-speaking Community lies wholly within the Walloon Region. Conflicts about jurisdiction between the bodies are resolved by the Constitutional Court of Belgium. The structure is intended as a compromise to allow different cultures to live together peacefully.|$|E
25|$|Under the Köppen climate classification, Brussels {{experiences}} an {{oceanic climate}} (Cfb). Brussels' proximity to coastal areas influences the area's climate by sending marine air masses from the Atlantic Ocean. Nearby wetlands also ensure a maritime temperate climate. On average (based on measurements {{over the last}} 100 years), there are approximately 200 days of rain {{per year in the}} <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region,</b> the second highest amount of any European capital, after Dublin (Ireland). Snowfall is infrequent, averaging 24 days per year. In Brussels, there are often violent thunderstorms.|$|E
25|$|Brussels {{is home to}} a {{large number}} of immigrants. At the last Belgian census, in 1991, 63.7% of {{inhabitants}} in <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region</b> answered that they were Belgian citizens, born as such in Belgium. However, there have been numerous individual or familial migrations towards Brussels, {{since the end of the}} 18th century, including political refugees (Karl Marx, Victor Hugo, Pierre Joseph Proudhon, Léon Daudet, for example), from neighbouring or more distant countries, as well as labour migrants, former foreign students or expatriates, and many Belgian families in Brussels can claim at least one foreign grandparent.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region</b> {{is one of}} {{the three}} federated regions of Belgium, {{alongside}} the Walloon Region and the Flemish Region. Geographically and linguistically, it is a bilingual enclave in the monolingual Flemish Region. Regions are one component of Belgium's institutions, the three communities being the other component: Brussels' inhabitants deal with either the French Community or the Flemish Community for matters such as culture and education, as well as a Common Community for competencies which do not belong exclusively to either Community, such as healthcare and assistance to individuals.|$|E
25|$|Historically a Dutch-speaking city, Brussels {{has seen}} a {{language}} shift to French from the late 19th century onwards. Today, the majority language is French, and the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region</b> is an officially bilingual enclave within the Flemish Region. All road signs, street names, and many advertisements and services are shown in both languages. Brussels is increasingly becoming multilingual, being home to many international institutions. English is spoken {{as a second language}} by {{nearly a third of the}} population, while a large number of migrants and expatriates speak other languages, namely Arabic, Spanish, German and Italian.|$|E
25|$|In Flemish circles, {{there is}} an ever {{continuing}} worry that the status of Dutch in Brussels will continue to deteriorate, and that the surrounding region will undergo even more Francization. On the political level, {{the division of the}} bilingual Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde (BHV) electoral and judicial district caused much linguistic strife. The district is composed of the 19 municipalities of the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region</b> in addition to the 35 municipalities of the Flemish administrative arrondissement of Halle-Vilvoorde. For elections to the Belgian Senate and to the European Parliament, which are organized by linguistic region, residents from anywhere in the arrondissement can vote for French-speaking parties in Wallonia and Brussels. For elections to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives, which is usually done by province, voters from Halle-Vilvoorde can vote for parties in Brussels, and vice versa. It was feared that, if BHV was divided, the francophones living in Halle-Vilvoorde would {{no longer be able to}} vote for candidates in Brussels, and they would lose the right to judicial proceedings in French. If a division were to take place, francophone political parties would demand that the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region</b> be expanded, a proposal that is unacceptable to Flemish parties. This issue was one of the chief reasons for the 200-day impasse in Belgian government formation in 2007, and it remained a hotly contested issue between the linguistic Communities, until this issue was resolved mid-2012.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 2011, {{following}} the longest political crisis in Belgium's contemporary history, a constitutional accord between the four main political families (socialists, liberals, social-Christians, ecologists), but excluding the Flemish nationalists, ushered in the sixth state reform which provided for major institutional changes and additional transfers of competences from the federal level to the Communities and the Regions. Among other changes, the Senate ceased to be directly elected to become an assembly of regional parliaments, the <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region</b> was granted constitutive autonomy, and the Regions received economic, employment and family welfare competences as well as greater fiscal autonomy.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region</b> {{is governed}} by a {{parliament}} of 89 members (72 French-speaking, 17 Dutch-speaking, parties are organised on a linguistic basis) and an eight-member regional cabinet consisting of a minister-president, four ministers and three state secretaries. By law, the cabinet must comprise two French-speaking and two Dutch-speaking ministers, one Dutch-speaking {{secretary of state and}} two French-speaking secretaries of state. The minister-president does not count against the language quota, but in practice every minister-president has been a bilingual francophone. The regional parliament can enact ordinances (French: ordonnances, Dutch: ordonnanties), which have equal status as a national legislative act.|$|E
25|$|The second-most spoken primary (Belgian) language, used {{natively}} {{by almost}} 40% of the population, is French. It {{is the official}} language of the French Community (which, like the Flemish Community, is a political entity), the dominant language in Wallonia (having also a small German-speaking Community) {{as well as the}} <b>Brussels-Capital</b> <b>Region.</b> Almost all of the inhabitants of the Capital region speak French as either their primary language (50%) or as a lingua franca (45%). There are also many Flemish people who speak French as a second language. Belgian French is in most respects identical to standard, Parisian French, but differs in some points of vocabulary, pronunciation, and semantics.|$|E
