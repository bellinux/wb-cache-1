At temperatures close to the solidus line, the high volatility of the alkaline becomes an issue of major concern for the sintering process.

In this study we assessed in a systematic way the effect of the various parameters influencing the shape of the sensitometric curve: <b>batch</b> <b>composition,</b> irradiation conditions, film processing, and film scanning. Two types of film, Kodak X-Omat V and CEA TVS, were irradiated, processed, and analyzed in three different institutions. The interinstitutional variation of the sensitometric curves, expressed as the OD variation at 50 cGy, can be up to 32 % and is mainly caused by differences in film processing and to a lesser degree to differences in <b>batch</b> <b>composition,</b> film scanning, and irradiation conditions. For the Kodak films, the average OD difference at 50 cGy between the three institutions is 17 % as a result of differences in <b>batch</b> <b>composition</b> and 25 % due to differences in processing conditions. For the CEA films these data are 6 % and 24 %, respectively. The long-term variation of the sensitometric curves of KODAK films in one institution was smaller than the differences in <b>batch</b> <b>composition</b> between the three institutions. The sensitometric curves of CEA films showed in one institution a large variation with time; the shape gradually varied from sigmoidal to quasilinear. By using relative OD values rather than absolute OD values, variations in sensitometric curves of KODAK films can be reduced to 2 %. Consequently, one sensitometric curve is sufficient to derive relative dose values.

One way to {{conserve}} the scarce high-quality raw materials resources {{and to reduce}} transport and energy costs {{is to use the}} accumulated technogenic mineral systems, as well as to study technogenic raw materials which were not previously used [1 - 3].

The chemical durability for the glass of composition 27 BaO· 45 B 2 O 3 · 18 Al 2 O 3 · 10 Fe 2 O 3 (mol%) at 90 °C in distilled water was 700 times lower than that of iron phosphate glass 40 Fe 2 O 3 · 60 P 2 O 5 (mol%).

The production process is designed {{in order to avoid the}} chemical reaction between the piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials, to prevent the formation of percolation chains of the magnetostrictive phase, and to maximize the mechanical coupling at the interface between the two phases. In this view, the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) is a low cost and flexible technique to shape nanoparticles into multilayered heterostructures. The combination of different materials by EPD, showing promising ME coupling, can be regarded as a useful, preliminary approach in the search of novel ME materials for many applications, potentially with great industrial and technological benefits. In this work, composite bilayer CFO/PZTN thick films were deposited on platinum coated alumina by EPD from ethanol-based colloidal suspensions.

Parameters for the high temperature carburization of thin-walled 4140 structures were determined. The research has shown that the amount of carbon in the walls of the structures can be controlled and uniform carbon contents across the cross-sections can be achieved in less than 30 minutes. Heat treatments for carburized samples were performed and subsequent microhardness testing resulted in values similar to conventionally produced 4140 steel. Studies on the decarburization behavior of similar alloys under various conditions were also performed in order to aid in the prediction of the microstructural behavior of samples during carburization and subsequent heat treatment. Low temperature gas carburization of structures with 316 steel composition has also been performed. Hardness variations present through the cross-section of the part after carburization suggest some transfer of carbon, though contents are not as high as anticipated.

40|$|Abstract Background Genome-wide {{association}} studies (GWAS) aim {{to identify}} genetic variants (usually {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} [SNPs]) across the entire human genome {{that are associated with}} phenotypic traits such as disease status and drug response. Highly accurate and reproducible genotype calling are paramount since errors introduced by calling algorithms can lead to inflation of false associations between genotype and phenotype. Most genotype calling algorithms currently used for GWAS are based on multiple arrays. Because hundreds of gigabytes (GB) of raw data are generated from a GWAS, the samples are typically partitioned into batches containing subsets of the entire dataset for genotype calling. High call rates and accuracies have been achieved. However, the effects of batch size (i. e., number of chips analyzed together) and of <b>batch</b> <b>composition</b> (i. e., the choice of chips in a batch) on call rate and accuracy as well as the propagation of the effects into significantly associated SNPs identified have not been investigated. In this paper, we analyzed both the batch size and <b>batch</b> <b>composition</b> for effects on the genotype calling algorithm BRLMM using raw data of 270 HapMap samples analyzed with the Affymetrix Human Mapping 500 K array set. Results Using data from 270 HapMap samples interrogated with the Affymetrix Human Mapping 500 K array set, three different batch sizes and three different batch compositions were used for genotyping using the BRLMM algorithm. Comparative analysis of the calling results and the corresponding lists of significant SNPs identified through association analysis revealed that both batch size and composition affected genotype calling results and significantly associated SNPs. Batch size and <b>batch</b> <b>composition</b> effects were more severe on samples and SNPs with lower call rates than ones with higher call rates, and on heterozygous genotype calls compared to homozygous genotype calls. Conclusion Batch size and composition affect the genotype calling results in GWAS using BRLMM. The larger the differences in batch sizes, the larger the effect. The more homogenous the samples in the batches, the more consistent the genotype calls. The inconsistency propagates to the lists of significantly associated SNPs identified in downstream association analysis. Thus, uniform and large batch sizes should be used to make genotype calls for GWAS. In addition, samples of high homogeneity should be placed into the same batch. </p...|$|E

The recycled glass powders are prepared by crushing and grinding waste glass bottles to a particles size distribution below than 75 µm.

The recycled glass powder are then mixed with the ball clay according to the ratio of SLSG to ball clay of 95 : 5 wt. %, 90 : 10 wt. % and 85 : 15 wt. %. Green samples of glass ceramic are then fabricated using Cold Isostatic Pressing (CIP) with constant pressure at 40 MPa.

It {{is well known}} that zeolite synthesis outcomes are sensitively dependent on the total <b>batch</b> <b>composition,</b> temperature, time and other initial and boundary conditions of the reaction system. Effects of the total <b>batch</b> <b>composition</b> on the nature of zeolite products are usually presented in the form of crystallization diagrams, but previous modeling efforts {{have not been able to}} explain structure of such diagrams. We calculate theoretical crystallization diagrams for synthesis of zeolites A and X under the assumption of pseudoequilibrium between the: two zeolite phases and a homogeneous solution. This approach allows us to analyze solubility effects separately from others, such as nucleation and competitive kinetics of crystal growth. First, we identify a solubility product of zeolite X using a thermodynamic-solution model that accurately represents speciation in zeolite mother liquors. As the silicon-to-aluminum ratio of zeolite X approaches the limiting value of I its solubility product approaches that of zeolite A. Then we calculate a theoretical crystallization diagram for zeolites A and X in the Na 2 O-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 2 H 3 O-H 2 O system. The results are ina very good agreement with experimental observations. This suggests that selective nucleation is not necessary to produce a pure zeolite product and that solubility considerations alone can explain observed crystallization diagrams in this particular case. Solubility based calculations using the present solution model can be used for steady-state design of reactors for synthesis of zeolites A and X when nucleation of desired phases is assured.

Bley and the band sound happy to have the time to themselves, and they mostly take it easy on light-hearted tunes with fun but simple arrangements". The Penguin Guide to Jazz awarded it 3⅓ stars stating [...] "with music as impressive and as ambitious as this, who's complaining? [...] " ...|$|R
