5|$|Players {{assume the}} role of a person {{suffering}} from depression, and the story centers on their daily life, including encounters at work and their relationship with their girlfriend. The story also features various treatments for depression. Players are periodically faced with choices that alter the course of the story. To make a choice, the player must click on the corresponding hyperlink. However, choices are often crossed out and cannot <b>be</b> <b>clicked</b> on, a mechanism that Depression Quest uses to portray the character's mental state and the fact that logical decisions may not be available to them. Beneath the choices presented to the player are a set of statements about the character, indicating their level of depression, {{whether or not they are}} in therapy, and whether or not they are currently on medication.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major change}} to the Start menu in Windows Vista is {{that it no longer}} {{presents}} the All programs menu as a horizontally expanding cascading list which utilizes the entire screen space, but instead as a nested folder view with a fixed size. The list of submenus and single items appears over the left column contents with a Back button below it. Subfolders expand and collapse vertically within the list when single-clicked, in a tree-like fashion similar to Windows Explorer. Single items appear at the top and folders appear at the bottom. Hovering the mouse over a folder does not open it; the folder needs to <b>be</b> <b>clicked.</b> A limitation of the new Start menu is that subfolders inside the All Programs menu cannot be opened simply by searching or double clicking. Also, as more programs are installed, a vertical scroll bar appears between the two columns. A dynamically changing icon showing the user's display picture by default is present {{at the top of the}} right column. It changes as users hover over any other item to reflect that item's icon. The Power button's action is configurable through Power options in the Control Panel, though the default setting is to put the computer into Sleep mode. Users can quickly lock their user account by pressing the Lock button. Additional power and account related actions are listed in a sub-menu which appears when the small arrow next to the Lock button is clicked.|$|E
500|$|The {{player is}} {{initially}} given a pasture with nine slots {{and a single}} plain cow, which the player may click once every six hours. Each time the cow is clicked, a point {{also known as a}} [...] "click" [...] is awarded; if the player adds friends' cows to their pasture, they also receive clicks added to their scores when the player clicks their own cow. As in other Facebook games, players are encouraged to post announcements to their news feed whenever they click their cow. A virtual currency known as [...] "Mooney" [...] can be bought with Facebook Credits; {{it can be used to}} purchase special [...] "premium" [...] cow designs, and the ability to skip the six-hour time limit that must be waited before the cow can <b>be</b> <b>clicked</b> again.|$|E

Mozilla Firefox introduced live bookmarks in 2004, which resemble standard bookmarks but contain a list of links to recent articles supplied by a news site or weblog, which is regularly updated via RSS feeds. [...] "Bookmarklets" [...] are JavaScript programs stored as bookmarks that can <b>be</b> <b>clicked</b> to perform a function.|$|E
2500|$|Windows Explorer {{includes}} {{significant changes}} from previous versions of Windows {{in terms of}} organization. Column headers are available in all Explorer views and allow filtering, sorting, grouping and stacking. Combined with integrated desktop search, Explorer allows users to find and organize their files in new ways, such as [...] "Stacks". The [...] "Stacks" [...] view groups files according to the criterion specified by the user. Stacks can <b>be</b> <b>clicked</b> to filter the files shown in Windows Explorer. Windows Explorer also sorts files on-the-fly automatically as they are renamed or pasted.|$|E
2500|$|... 1UP.com's Garnett Lee {{rated the}} game a D-, calling the Dark Fall games [...] "woefully {{out of date}} point and click mysteries [...] Their stories play out more like an {{illustrated}} book.

[...] Of the graphics, he wrote [...] "many users will have screensavers that look better than Lights Out." [...] He concluded [...] "Lights Out more resembles a student project for a gaming college than a finished retail product [...] Even fans of style will want to spend their time elsewhere. As the new [...] shows, even the point and click adventure has grown some over the past decade. Lights Out has not." ...|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{problems}} associated with search engine advertising <b>is</b> <b>click</b> fraud. This <b>is</b> when ads <b>are</b> <b>clicked</b> on with no intention of purchasing anything. The search engines still charge the advertiser for these clicks, if the advertiser does not discover the fraud. Many online advertisers have discovered that clicks do not equal calls.|$|R

2500|$|Most {{controls}} are {{relegated to the}} nine keys of the number pad, and the game is completely playable using only the keyboard (numpad keys and enter), excluding the start menu and control screen. This is assisted by a visual representation of the keypad in the lower {{right corner of the}} screen, which also shows the function of each key at any given time. For example, during ship-to-ship combat, the [...] "3", [...] "7", and [...] "1" [...] keys on the numpad representation are shown with images of different cannonball types - these buttons are used to select different types of cannonballs to fire. The on-screen keypad can also <b>be</b> <b>clicked</b> with a mouse, performing the same function as the keyboard key would have performed. Though the mouse can be used for various commands, the keypad is the preferred input mechanism due to the game's mechanics.|$|E
50|$|The game also {{incorporates}} point-and-click elements {{which allows}} the player to move and manipulate certain items in the world. For example, a barrel can <b>be</b> <b>clicked</b> and dragged to move it, revealing that a key is underneath it, or a hay bale can <b>be</b> <b>clicked</b> to spread it out and provide a bed for the player to rest.|$|E
