40|$|In {{light of}} the growing {{significance}} of trade in financial services, and the emphasis placed on trade in financial services during the Uruguay round of trade negotiations, this article is the first study of the determinants of intra-industry trade (IIT) <b>in</b> <b>insurance</b> services. The article analyzes and measures the magnitude of IIT <b>in</b> <b>insurance</b> services for the United States. The empirical results of the determinants of IIT indicate that foreign direct investment <b>in</b> <b>insurance</b> services (FDI) is a significant contributor to the volume of trade <b>in</b> <b>insurance</b> services. These empirical findings confirm the new theoretical trade models that, unlike the traditional trade theory that considered trade and foreign direct investment <b>in</b> <b>insurance</b> services as substitutes, trade and FDI complement each other and hence multinational insurance companies are contributing {{to an increase in}} the volume of trade <b>in</b> <b>insurance</b> services. Furthermore, this study shows that trade intensity between the United States and its trading partners leads to product differentiation <b>in</b> <b>insurance</b> services and hence an increase in consumer welfare.

40|$|The {{author of}} the {{presented}} paper is trying {{to develop and implement}} the model that can mimic {{the state of the art}} models of operational risk <b>in</b> <b>insurance.</b> It implements generalized Pareto dis-tribution and Monte Carlo simulation and tries to mimic and construct operational risk models <b>in</b> <b>insurance.</b> At the same time, it compares lognormal, Weibull and loglogistic distribution and their application <b>in</b> <b>insurance</b> industry. It is known that operational risk models <b>in</b> <b>insurance</b> are cha-racterized by extreme tails, therefore the following analysis should be conducted: the body of dis-tribution should be analyzed separately from the tail of the distribution. Afterwards the convolu-tion method can be used to put together the annual loss distribution by combining the body and tail of the distribution. Monte Carlo method of convolution is utilized. Loss frequency in opera-tional risk <b>in</b> <b>insurance</b> and overall loss distribution based on copula function, in that manner us-ing student-t copula and Monte Carlo method are analysed. The aforementioned approach repre-sents another aspect of observing operational risk models <b>in</b> <b>insurance.</b> This paper introduces: 1) Tools needed for operational risk models; 2) Application of R code in operational risk modeling; 3) Distributions used in operational risk models, specializing in insurance; 4) Construction of opera...|$|R

To {{evaluate}} {{the extent of}} racial gaps <b>in</b> child health <b>insurance</b> coverage <b>in</b> South America and study the contribution of wealth, human capital, and other household characteristics to accounting for racial disparities <b>in</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage. Data Sources/Study Setting. Primary data collected between 2005 and 2006 in 30 pediatric practices in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, and Chile. Design. Country-specific regression models are used to assess differences <b>in</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage by race. A decomposition model is used to quantify {{the extent to which}} wealth, human capital, and other household characteristics account for racial disparities <b>in</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage. Data Collection/Extraction Methods. In-person interviews were conducted with the mothers of 2, 365 children. Principal Findings. The majority of children have no <b>insurance</b> coverage except <b>in</b> Chile. Large racial disparities <b>in</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage are observed. Household wealth {{is the single most important}} household-level factor accounting for racial disparities in coverage and is significantly and positively associated with coverage, followed by maternal education and employment/occupational status. Geographic differences account for the largest part of racial disparities <b>in</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage <b>in</b> Argentina and Ecuador. Conclusions. Increasing the coverage of children in less affluent families is important for reducing racial gaps <b>in</b> health <b>insurance</b> coverage <b>in</b> the study countries...|$|R
