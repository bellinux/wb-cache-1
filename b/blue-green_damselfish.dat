30|$|After {{the holding}} period, <b>blue-green</b> <b>damselfish</b> were {{randomly}} {{divided into two}} different groups for the control and hyperthermic treatment. The temperature was maintained at 26 °C[*]±[*] 0.5 °C for control group and 32 °C[*]±[*] 0.5 °C for hyperthermic group. A 100  W automatic heater (EBO-JÄGER, El Segundo, CA, USA) was used to maintain the temperature. After 12 -h short-term exposure, the experimental animals {{were randomly selected from}} two tanks and anesthetized by immersion in MS- 222 (50  mg/l) before sampling.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Scuticociliatosis, {{which is}} caused by an {{opportunistic}} ciliate protozoan, is responsible for significant economic losses in marine ornamental fish. This study reports the occurrence of Uronema sp., which {{was found to be}} parasitizing three species of marine reef fish imported into Brazil and maintained in quarantine: Vanderbilt’s Chromis (Chromis vanderbilti), <b>blue-green</b> <b>damselfish</b> (Chromis viridis), and sea goldie (Pseudanthias squamipinnis). During the quarantine period, some fish presented with behavioral disorders and hemorrhages and ulcerative lesions on the body surface. Histopathological analysis showed hemorrhages, inflammation comprising mononuclear and granular cells in the skeletal muscle, and necrosis of the skin and the secondary lamellae of the gills, and parasites were also observed in the renal capsule. The absence of transboundary measures available to prevent the occurrence of ornamental fish diseases is also discussed...|$|E
30|$|The <b>blue-green</b> <b>damselfish</b> (Chromis viridis) is a {{stenothermal}} teleost that {{is abundant}} on coral reefs {{throughout much of}} the Indo-Pacific region (Allen [1991]; Lieske and Myers [1994]), including southern Taiwan (Shen et al. [1993]). Previous {{studies have shown that the}} average temperature in Nanwan Bay, Kenting National Park, southern Taiwan is 26 °C to 27 °C and increases to approximately 32 °C to 33 °C during the day (Meng et al. [2008]; Mayfield et al. [2013]). Accordingly, the normal and hyperthermic temperatures of 26 °C and 32 °C, respectively, were used in this study. The goal of this study was to investigate the stress responses, PQC mechanism, and osmoregulatory response in the gills of C. viridis exposed to an increase in ambient temperature (32 °C) for 12  h to ascertain the physiological strategies employed by stenothermal teleosts under short-term thermal stress.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: In the {{foreground}} is an orange-lined triggerfish displaying spines. Triggerfish have mouths that crush shells. Orange-lined triggerfish are particularly aggressive. The {{black and white}} fish are three-stripe damselfish and the unstriped fish are <b>blue-green</b> chromis <b>damselfish.</b> If the triggerfish attacks, the damselfish will hide in the nearby pillar coral. If the triggerfish wants to hide, it will squeeze into a coral crevice and lock itself in place with its spines.|$|R
30|$|<b>Blue-green</b> <b>damselfish</b> 2.8 [*]±[*] 0.4  g {{in weight}} and 4.1 [*]± 0.7  cm in length were {{obtained}} from husbandry center of National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium (NMMBA), Pingtung, Taiwan. Fish were reared in a tank with a 300  L seawater (SW, 33 % to 35 ‰) circulating system at 26 [*]±[*] 0.5 °C with a daily 12 -h photoperiod at least 4  weeks for the holding period. The waters were continuously circulated through fabric-floss filters, and the environmental salinity {{was measured by the}} refractomter PAL- 06 S (ATAGO, Tokyo, Japan). Fish were fed daily with commercial pellets (TetraMarin®, Tetra, Melle, Germany) except 48  h prior to the sampling. No mortality was observed during the holding period. For all following experiments, 28 individuals were sacrificed. The facilities and protocols for the experimental fish were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of College of Marine Sciences, Nation Dong Hwa University (i.e., NMMBA).|$|E
