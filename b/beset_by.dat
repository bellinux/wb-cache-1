40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} new study on the elastic {{scattering}} cross section of dark matter(DM) and neutrinos using the latest cosmological data from Planck andlarge-scale structure experiments. We find that the strongest constraints <b>areset</b> <b>by</b> the Lyman-alpha forest, giving sigma_{DM-neutrino} < 10 ^{- 33 } (m_DM/GeV) cm^ 2 if the cross section is constant and a present-day value ofsigma_{DM-neutrino} < 10 ^{- 45 } (m_DM/GeV) cm^ 2 if it scales as the temperaturesquared. These are the most robust limits on DM-neutrino interactions to date,demonstrating that one can use the distribution of matter in the Universe toprobe dark ("invisible") interactions. Additionally, we show that scenariosinvolving thermal MeV DM and a constant elastic scattering cross sectionnaturally predict (i) a cut-off in the matter power spectrum at the Lyman-alphascale, (ii) N_eff ~ 3. 5 +/- 0. 4, (iii) H_ 0 ~ 71 +/- 3 km/s/Mpc and (iv) thepossible generation of neutrino masses...|$|R

He returned to Britain in 1946, to find a country still <b>beset</b> <b>by</b> wartime rationing and shortages.|$|E

5|$|The {{academic}} {{study of}} slavery in ancient Greece is <b>beset</b> <b>by</b> significant methodological problems. Documentation is disjointed and very fragmented, focusing primarily on the city-state of Athens.

Greek comedies and tragedies represented stereotypes, while iconography made no substantial differentiation between slaves and craftsmen.|$|E

Conversely, act utilitarianism was criticized for not allowing for a 'human element' in its calculations, i.e. it is sometimes too difficult (or impossible) for an ordinary person.|$|E

50|$|Eduardo Ravelo, {{the current}} {{leader of the}} Barrio Azteca, began his {{criminal}} career in the year 2003, amassing a list of charges for racketeering and numerous conspiracy charges {{with the intent to}} distribute narcotics. In the year 2005, an informant and former lieutenant of the gang testified that Ravelo was looking for a man who had stolen goods from the Juárez cartel. The informant said that Ravelo was taken to a house in El Paso where a gang member was being held, his mouth, wrists, and ankles bound with duct tape. Ravelo then ordered the traitor to be sent to the Juárez cartel, and he was never heard from again. In El Paso Ravelo's gang is known as Barrio Azteca, a gang originally morphed from the so-called Mexican Mafia prison gang. During its initial years, the gang's aim was street robbery to collect funds to liberate prisoners in jail. Today, the gang has expanded into a large criminal gang with presence in both the United States and Mexico, <b>besetting</b> <b>by</b> drug trafficking and human smuggling. In Ciudad Juárez, however, the gang is known as Los Aztecas. Under the tutelage of Ravelo, the gang moves narcotics along the border with the aid of Vicente Carrillo Fuentes' cartel.|$|R
