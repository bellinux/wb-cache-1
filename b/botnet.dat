40|$|Abstract—“Botnet ” is {{a network}} of {{computers}} that are compromised and controlled by an attacker. <b>Botnets</b> {{are one of the}} most serious threats to today’s Internet. Most current <b>botnets</b> have centralized command and control (C&C) architecture. However, peer-to-peer (P 2 P) structured <b>botnets</b> have gradually emerged as a new advanced form of <b>botnets.</b> Without central C&C servers, P 2 P <b>botnets</b> are more resilient to defenses and countermeasures than traditional centralized <b>botnets.</b> In this paper, we systematically study P 2 P <b>botnets</b> along multiple dimensions: bot candidate selection, network construction, C&C mechanisms and communication protocols, and mitigation approaches. We carefully study two defense approaches: index poisoning and sybil attack. According to the common idea shared by them, we are able to give analytical results to evaluate their performance. We also propose possible counter techniques which might be developed by attackers against index poisoning and sybil attack defenses. In addition, we obtain one interesting finding: compared to traditional centralized <b>botnets,</b> by using index poisoning technique, it is easier to shut down or at least effectively mitigate P 2 P <b>botnets</b> that adopt existing P 2 P protocols and rely on file index to disseminate commands.

40|$|Part 1 : THEMES AND ISSUESInternational audienceThe use of <b>botnets</b> for {{malicious}} activities {{has grown}} significantly in recent years. Criminals leverage the flexibility and anonymity associated with <b>botnets</b> to harvest personal data, generate spam, distribute malware and launch distributed denial-of-service attacks. These same attributes readily translate to applications that can support operations in warfare. In 2007, distributed denial-of-service attacks launched by <b>botnets</b> targeted IT assets belonging to Estonian banks, newspapers and parliament. This paper explores {{the use of}} <b>botnets</b> as instruments of warfare. Seven scenarios are used to demonstrate how traditional applications of <b>botnets</b> such as spam, theft of resources and distributed denial-of-service attacks can have implications across the spectrum of warfare. Additionally, the paper discusses the ethical and political concerns {{associated with the use}} of <b>botnets</b> by nation states...|$|R
50|$|While <b>botnets</b> {{are often}} {{named after the}} malware that created them, {{multiple}} <b>botnets</b> typically use the same malware, but are operated by different entities.|$|R
25|$|While the {{infection}} {{targets of the}} Asprox <b>botnet</b> are randomly determined through Google searches, some high-profile websites have been infected in the past. Some of these infections have received individual coverage.|$|E
25|$|The <b>botnet</b> usually {{attacks in}} waves - {{the goal of}} each wave is to infect as many {{websites}} as possible, thus achieving the highest possible spread rate. Once a wave is completed the <b>botnet</b> lay dormant for an extended amount of time, likely to prevent aggressive counterreactions from the security community. The initial wave took place in July, 2008, which infected an estimated 1,000 - 2,000 pages. An additional wave took place in October 2009, infecting {{an unknown number of}} websites. Another wave took place in June 2010, increasing the estimated total number of infected domains from 2,000 to an estimated 10,000 - 13,000 within a day.|$|E
25|$|The PDoS {{is a pure}} {{hardware}} targeted attack {{which can}} be much faster and requires fewer resources than using a <b>botnet</b> or a root/vserver in a DDoS attack.

40|$|International audienceThe {{new threat}} of the Internet, but little known to the 'general public' is {{constituted}} by <b>botnets.</b> <b>Botnets</b> are networks of infected computers, which are headed by a pirate called also 'Attacker' or 'Master'. The <b>botnets</b> are nowadays mainly responsible for large-scale coordinated attacks. The attacker can ask the infected computers called 'Agents' or 'Zombies' to perform all sorts of tasks for him, like sending spam, performing DDoS attacks, phishing campaigns, delivering malware, or leasing or selling their <b>botnets</b> to other fraudsters anywhere. In this paper we present a classification that reflects the life cycle and current resilience techniques of <b>botnets,</b> distinguishing the propagation, the injection, the control and the attack phases.

3000|$|<b>Botnets</b> are {{collections}} of infected computers that are controlled remotely by cyber-criminals. Originally <b>botnets</b> were created {{for a specific}} purpose such as sending spam, identity theft or DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks. However, in 2010 bots that were designed to provide the cyber-criminal {{with the ability to}} build designer <b>botnets</b> (e.g., Zeus-based <b>botnets)</b> were rented out to other cyber-criminals for specific purposes (spam, identity theft, DDoS, etc). These criminal organizations invest significant building logical groupings of compromised systems that are organized around a sophisticated, resilient Command-and-Control (C&C) infrastructure or even through social networks [7]. Such criminal networks are exceptionally stealthy and easily evade signature or behavior-based defenses. They can mimic normal application and traffic patterns, and can change their core software far faster than traditional security solutions can update their signature-based systems. We refer to such professionally designed and cyber-criminal oriented <b>botnets</b> as modern <b>botnets,</b> which have the following features: [...]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Botnets</b> {{represent}} a serious security threat on the Inter-net. Current security mechanism are typically inadequate for protecting against the latest breed of <b>botnets,</b> as botherders constantly develop new techniques and methods to frustrate investigators. Until recently, mobile networks {{have been relatively}} isolated from the Internet, so {{there has been little}} need for protecting against <b>botnets.</b> However, this situation is rapidly changing. Mobile networks are now well integrated with the Internet, so that threats on the Internet most likely will migrate over to the mobile networks and vice versa. <b>Botnets</b> of malware injected into mo-bile devices will probably appear very soon, and there are already signs of this happening. This paper analyses the potential threat of <b>botnets</b> based on mobile networks...|$|R

The web resources are {{claimed to be}} controversial or offensive (i.e. sexually explicit content, certain political and religious websites, anonymizers and proxies) or harmful (i.e. numeric IP addresses, known phishing or malicious websites, <b>botnet</b> command servers). The use of content filtering is mandated by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) of the United Arab Emirates.|$|E
25|$|DHTs form an {{infrastructure}} {{that can be}} used to build more complex services, such as anycast, cooperative Web caching, distributed file systems, domain name services, instant messaging, multicast, and also peer-to-peer file sharing and content distribution systems. Notable distributed networks that use DHTs include BitTorrent's distributed tracker, the Coral Content Distribution Network, the Kad network, the Storm <b>botnet,</b> the Tox instant messenger, Freenet and the YaCy search engine.|$|E
25|$|A {{distributed}} denial-of-service (DDoS) attack {{occurs when}} multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually {{one or more}} web servers. Such an attack is often the result of multiple compromised systems (for example, a <b>botnet)</b> flooding the targeted system with traffic. A <b>botnet</b> is a network of zombie computers programmed to receive commands without the owners' knowledge. When a server is overloaded with connections, new connections {{can no longer be}} accepted. The major advantages to an attacker of using a distributed denial-of-service attack are that multiple machines can generate more attack traffic than one machine, multiple attack machines are harder to turn off than one attack machine, and that the behavior of each attack machine can be stealthier, making it harder to track and shut down. These attacker advantages cause challenges for defense mechanisms. For example, merely purchasing more incoming bandwidth than the current volume of the attack might not help, because the attacker might be able to simply add more attack machines. This, after all, will end up completely crashing a website for periods of time.|$|E
30|$|<b>Botnets</b> become {{widespread}} in wired and wireless networks, whereas the relevant research {{is still in}} the initial stage. In this paper, a survey of <b>botnets</b> is provided. We first discuss fundamental concepts of <b>botnets,</b> including formation and exploitation, lifecycle, and two major kinds of topologies. Several related attacks, detection, tracing, and countermeasures, are then introduced, followed by recent research work and possible future challenges.|$|R

25|$|Benefit is {{the total}} {{expected}} profit from spam, which may include any combination of the commercial and non-commercial reasons listed above. It is normally linear, based on the incremental benefit of reaching each additional spam recipient, combined with the conversion rate. The conversion rate for botnet-generated spam has recently been measured to be around one in 12,000,000 for pharmaceutical spam and one in 200,000 for infection sites as used by the Storm <b>botnet.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{kinds of}} DoS rely {{primarily}} on brute force, flooding the target with an overwhelming flux of packets, oversaturating its connection bandwidth or depleting the target's system resources. Bandwidth-saturating floods {{rely on the}} attacker having higher bandwidth available than the victim; a common way of achieving this today is via distributed denial-of-service, employing a <b>botnet.</b> Another target of DDoS attacks may be to produce added costs for the application operator, when the latter uses resources based on cloud computing. In this case normally application used resources are tied to a needed Quality of Service level (e.g. responses should be less than 200 ms) and this rule is usually linked to automated software (e.g. Amazon CloudWatch) to raise more virtual resources from the provider {{in order to meet}} the defined QoS levels for the increased requests.The main incentive behind such attacks may be to drive the application owner to raise the elasticity levels in order to handle the increased application traffic, in order to cause financial losses or force them to become less competitive. Other floods may use specific packet types or connection requests to saturate finite resources by, for example, occupying the maximum number of open connections or filling the victim's disk space with logs.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to Operation Pillar of Defense, a November 2012 Israeli military {{operation in the}} Gaza Strip, Anons took down hundreds of Israeli websites with DDoS attacks. Anons pledged another [...] "massive cyberassault" [...] against Israel in April 2013 in retaliation for its actions in Gaza, promising to [...] "wipe Israel off {{the map of the}} Internet". However, its DDoS attacks caused only temporary disruptions, leading cyberwarfare experts to suggest that the group had been unable to recruit or hire <b>botnet</b> operators for the attack.|$|E
30|$|With {{the advent}} of the Internet of Everything, the {{possibility}} of malware taking control of ‘smart’ appliances such as television, air-conditioners, refrigerators, etc. will not be limited to theory. In fact, there have been recent reports of ‘smart’ refrigerators and cars being hacked, and wi-fi-enabled LED bulbs having security weaknesses [16]. As the creators of <b>botnets</b> continue to adopt innovative means in creating <b>botnets,</b> detection of stealthy <b>botnets</b> continues to be a challenging paradigm.|$|R
50|$|IRC {{networks}} use simple, {{low bandwidth}} communication methods, making them widely used to host <b>botnets.</b> They {{tend to be}} relatively simple in construction, and have been used with moderate success for coordinating DDoS attacks and spam campaigns while being able to continually switch channels to avoid being taken down. However, {{in some cases the}} mere blocking of certain keywords has proven effective in stopping IRC-based <b>botnets.</b> The RFC 1459 (IRC) standard is popular with <b>botnets.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Since its {{discovery}} in 2008 the Asprox <b>botnet</b> {{has been involved}} in multiple high-profile attacks on various websites in order to spread malware. The <b>botnet</b> itself consists of roughly 15,000 infected computers as of May, 2008, [...] although the size of the <b>botnet</b> itself is highly variable as the controllers of the <b>botnet</b> have been known to deliberately shrink (and later regrow) their <b>botnet</b> in order to prevent more aggressive countermeasures from the IT Community.|$|E

It was estimated that the <b>botnet</b> was responsible for about 10.39% of the worldwide spam volume on December 29, 2009, with a surge up to 14% on New Year's Day, though the actual percentage seems to rise and drop rapidly. As of April 2010 {{it is estimated that}} the <b>botnet</b> sends roughly 5.7 billion spam messages a day, or about 4.3% of the global spam volume.|$|E

50|$|Newer <b>botnets</b> fully operate over P2P networks.
