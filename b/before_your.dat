500|$|... "Flashes <b>Before</b> <b>Your</b> Eyes" [...] {{received}} mostly positive reviews. IGN's Chris Carabott {{wrote that}} [...] "if last week's 'Not in Portland' didn't {{get you back}} on the Lost hype train then for goodness' sake the equally outstanding 'Flashes <b>Before</b> <b>Your</b> Eyes' hopefully grabbed your attention." [...] Carabott went on to praise the on-screen chemistry of Henry Ian Cusick (Desmond) and Sonya Walger (Penelope), stating that [...] "their on screen chemistry makes the love between the two characters real and makes their inevitable breakup that much harder to handle." [...] He also complimented the scene between Desmond and Charles, saying that [...] "it's hard not to feel Desmond's heart crushed when Widmore denies him Penelope's hand in marriage." [...] Josh Spiegel, a writer for CinemaBlend.com, had similar praise. He said that for him [...] "it was a nice change of pace to not see Jack, Kate or Sawyer {{on the show and}} focus more on some of the lesser-known castaways." [...] Spiegel {{went on to say that}} the episode was [...] "fantastic". Mania.com's Stephen Lackey wrote that [...] "Flashes <b>Before</b> <b>Your</b> Eyes" [...] was an [...] "episode has everything die hard LOST fans expect, riveting plot twists, foreshadowing, and as many questions as answers" ...|$|E

"We protest <b>before</b> <b>your</b> Majesty and {{the whole}} world that until this great person be removed from {{intermeddling}} with the great affairs of state, we are out of hope of any good success; and do fear that any money we shall or can give will, through his misemployment, be turned rather to the hurt and prejudice of this your kingdom than otherwise, as by lamentable experience we have found those large supplies formerly and lately given."

500|$|... "The Constant" [...] is {{the second}} Lost episode to deal {{directly}} {{with the concept of}} time travel after [...] "Flashes <b>Before</b> <b>Your</b> Eyes" [...] from the third season. [...] While promoting that episode, Lindelof said that it uses the flashback device [...] "in a way we never have before and never will again" [...] and while promoting [...] "The Constant", he said that it [...] "upholds that pledge, unpledges it, then repledges it." [...] Losts writer-producers enjoy science fiction themes such as time travel; however, they were careful not to create a paradox. [...] The rules for time-travel in the series are outlined in [...] "Flashes <b>Before</b> <b>Your</b> Eyes"—although, Lindelof has said that [...] "The Constant" [...] is a more important episode in terms of explaining time travel on the show—by Ms. Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan), who explains that certain events are inevitable and the universe will eventually correct any errors. [...] Had these rules not been established, the writers feared that viewers would lose interest because the stakes of the characters would be lessened. [...] The writers hoped that [...] "The Constant" [...] would further establish that there are no parallel universes or alternate realities. [...] Lindelof reminisced that [...] "just breaking that episode was such a massive headache" [...] and Cuse added that [...] "it was definitely like doing the hardest New York Times crossword puzzle for the week".|$|E
500|$|... "Flashes <b>Before</b> <b>Your</b> Eyes" [...] is the 8th {{episode of}} the third season of the American drama {{television}} series Lost, and the show's 57th [...] episode overall.

Lindelof and Goddard were nominated for the Writers Guild of America (WGA) Award for Best Episodic Drama at the February 2008 ceremony for writing the episode.|$|E

500|$|One New York {{flashback}} {{was filmed}} {{on the same}} Honolulu, Oahu, Hawaii street {{that had been used}} by set decorator Carol Bayne Kelley as Berlin, Germany in the fourth season's [...] "The Economist" [...] and London, England in the third season's [...] "Flashes <b>Before</b> <b>Your</b> Eyes". The cliffhanger, in which Alex, Karl and Rousseau are in the jungle, was shot at Dillingham Ranch on the northwest tip of Oahu near the beach where the pilot and other early episodes were primarily filmed. The scene originally ended with [...] "snipers emerging through the jungle in these incredible, elaborate, jungle camouflage uniforms"; however, this was cut in post-production. Elements of this would be re-shot and used in the next episode when the snipers are identified.|$|E
500|$|One critic theorized, [...] "...ather than {{end this}} Brazil-ian sci-fi dystopia with the {{equivalent}} of that film's shot of its lobotomized hero, which puts the lie to the immediately previous scene of his imagined liberation, Spielberg tries to pass off exactly the same ending but without the rimshot, {{just to see if}} the audience is paying attention." [...] Film scholars Nigel Morris and Jason P. Vest point to a line in the film as possible evidence of this. After Anderton is captured, Gideon tells him that, [...] "It's actually kind of a rush. They say you have visions. That your life flashes <b>before</b> <b>your</b> eyes. That all your dreams come true."*Vest. pg. 135 While Vest considers the blissful dream ending a possibility, he questions why Anderton did not imagine his son as having returned.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of Midtown Madness were {{generally}} positive, with video game critics praising its gameplay. IGN {{wrote that the}} game [...] "doesn't rely heavily on driving authenticity; this game's all about fun." [...] The review also praised the simplicity whereby players can [...] "pick a real-world car and go". GameSpot wrote that [...] "it's fun {{to be able to}} drive like a maniac [...] because you know you can't in real life." [...] Computer and Video Games remarked on the game's humor, provided by other drivers, police, and competitors (described as maniacs), praising the [...] "carnage that unfolds <b>before</b> <b>your</b> windscreen". PC Zone recommended the game, calling it highly refreshing; Total Video Games said the game seemed a good choice, but suggested that it would be outdone by GT Interactive's Driver, released soon after.|$|E

500|$|Fodor (who {{is now a}} close friend) is {{a gentle}} man inside a burly body, and prone to an even burlier style of arguing.

500|$|Amiga reviewers had {{a common}} grouse: the {{frequent}} disk swaps required were tedious. [...] Regardless, the game's tense atmospheregenerated by {{the combination of}} game mechanics, use of sounds, and artificial intelligenceprovided memorable moments to many reviewers. [...] As one of themSimon Clays of Amiga Computingput it, Space Hulk was [...] "a very difficult strategy-cum-3D dungeon-esque title with plenty of action and gripping play." [...] May said the game offered [...] "demented" [...] violence but was [...] "irresistibly exhiliarating when the action erupts in nonstop, heartpounding carnage." [...] A decade after the game's release, several reviewers mentioned Space Hulk as a Warhammer 40,000 video game worthy of praise. [...] Meer reflected on replaying the game fifteen years after its release, [...] "The panic and terror of facing 90 degrees away from your enemy, and knowing that you can't do a damn thing about it <b>before</b> <b>your</b> lower intestine spills onto your feet, is still something pretty special." ...|$|E
500|$|The head of British Secret Intelligence Service, Stewart Menzies, {{stated that}} Cicero {{was indeed a}} double agent and that among the {{documents}} submitted to the Germans were documents of misinformation. Author James Srodes states in his biography of Allen Dulles that some British historians believed that Cicero was [...] "'turned' into a double agent to send disinformation via von Papen". Malcolm Gladwell, author of Pandora's Briefcase, said that an interviewer had questioned Menzies before he died about whether {{he was telling the}} truth. Menzies told the interviewer [...] "Of course, Cicero was under our control," [...] but his truthfulness is questioned. Gladwell stated in an article in The New Yorker; [...] "if you had been the wartime head of M.I.6, giving an interview shortly <b>before</b> <b>your</b> death, you probably would say that Cicero was one of yours." [...] Gladwell also mentions that while Ribbentrop was wary of Bazna, which curtailed the dissemination of some of Bazna's intelligence, most German intelligence officials were not wary of him.|$|E
