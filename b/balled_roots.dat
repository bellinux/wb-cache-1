2500|$|The {{final stage}} of cultivation, harvesting, is carried out {{in a number of}} ways; one of the more popular methods is the pick-your-own tree farm, where {{customers}} are allowed to roam the farm, select their tree, and cut it down themselves. Other farmers cultivate potted trees, with <b>balled</b> <b>roots,</b> which can be replanted after Christmas and used again the following year ...|$|E
2500|$|Christmas trees can be {{harvested}} and marketed in different ways. Some operations {{are known as}} [...] "choose-and-cut" [...] or pick-your-own farms, which allow customers {{to walk through the}} planted land, select their Christmas tree and cut down themselves. Wholesale operations are more labor-intensive because they usually require the farmer to complete tasks such as baling, cutting, moving the trees to a roadside pick-up, and loading the harvest. In addition, this work must be completed during a very short period in November. Growers also harvest trees by digging and <b>balling</b> the <b>root</b> and selling the trees as nursery stock or as live, reusable Christmas trees. This last option allows trees to {{be harvested}} earlier than the usual six- to ten-year period required to grow a mature Christmas tree.|$|R

One 1200 acre farm in Oregon lacked road access, so it began using helicopters to move up to 200,000 Christmas trees per year. Helicopters reduce the amount of time between harvesting and market, cutting it from up to two weeks down to as little as three days.|$|R
5000|$|The Greek and Roman writers {{generally}} derive {{the name}} of the people from their skill as slingers (/baleareis, from /ballo: ancient Greek meaning [...] "to launch"), although Strabo regards the name as of Phoenician origin. He observed it was the Phoenician equivalent for lightly armoured soldiers the Greeks would have called /gymnetas. The <b>root</b> <b>bal</b> does point to a Phoenician origin; perhaps the islands were sacred to the god Baal and the resemblance to the Greek root ΒΑΛ (in /ballo) is accidental. Indeed, it was usual Greek practice to assimilate local names into their own language. But the common Greek name of the islands is not /Baleareis, but /Gymnesiai. The former was the name used by the natives, {{as well as by the}} Carthaginians and Romans, while the latter probably derives from the light equipment of the Balearic troops /gymnetae.|$|R
