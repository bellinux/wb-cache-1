[...] In an interview with Perez Hilton, Hilson said that she cannot allow other people or the media to dictate what she can and what cannot do.

Ellen DeGeneres presented Gaga with a bikini made of vegetables when the singer appeared on her talk show, and the singer used the platform to respond to the controversy surrounding the dress saying, [...] "... it has many interpretations.

500|$|Many {{practitioners}} combine their polytheistic world-view with a pantheistic {{conception of}} the natural world as being sacred and imbued with a divine energy force permeating all life. Heathenry is animistic, with practitioners believing in nonhuman spirit persons commonly known as [...] "wights" [...] (vættir) that inhabit the world, each of whom is believed to have its own personality. Some of these are known as [...] "land spirits" [...] (landvættir) and inhabit different aspects of the landscape, living alongside humans, whom they can both help and hinder. Others are deemed to be household deities and live within the home, where they can be propitiated with offerings of food. Some Heathens interact with these entities and provide offerings to them more often than they do with the gods and goddesses. Wights are often identified with various creatures from Northwestern European folklore such as elves, dwarves, gnomes, and trolls. Some of these entities—such as the Jötunn of Norse mythology—are deemed to be baleful spirits; within the community it is often deemed taboo to provide offerings to them, although some practitioners still do so. Many Heathens also <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> respect ancestral spirits.|$|E

It's honesty with big melodies. And I'm singing the s*** out of them". Labeled as a [...] "romantic croon", the opening track, [...] "Somewhere in Brooklyn", was composed by The Smeezingtons. It features [...] "an emo-pop backing" [...] beat, a piano and synthesizers. Lyrically, the tune is about Mars chasing the [...] "perfect woman" [...] who got away, and wishing to find her again. The second release, [...] "The Other Side", features a vocal collaboration with Cee Lo Green and B.o.B., and is considered the best on the EP by some critics. The track {{has been described as}} incorporating 60's and 70's soulful feeling. Its instrumentation uses guitar, organ and a: [...] "drum and bass pace that slowly builds through the verse and into the chorus". It is reminiscent of compositions by Daniel Merriweather and Chris Isaak’s [...] "Wicked Game". [...] "The Other Side" [...] shows Mars' darker side has a [...] "soaring pop" [...] hook.|$|E

A jury convicted Sandford on the cruelty charge but was hung on the charge of manslaughter. On appeal, the verdict in the cruelty case was upheld; and at retrial, Sandford was convicted of manslaughter. In 1905, the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine reversed the manslaughter conviction because the trial judge had required jurors to make a decision based on their own belief about the [...] "efficacy of prayer as a means to cure the sick."

Evangelical Friends regard the Bible as the infallible and self-authenticating Word of God. The statement of faith of Evangelical Friends International, is comparable to the statement of faith of other Evangelical churches. Evangelical Friends who are members of Evangelical Friends International, are mainly located in the U.S., Central America, and Asia. Beginning in the 1880s, some Friends began using outward sacraments in their Sunday services, first in Evangelical Friends Church–Eastern Region (then known as Ohio Yearly Meeting [...] ). Friends Church–Southwest Region, has also approved the practice of using the outward sacraments in their Sunday services. In places where Evangelical Friends are engaged in missionary work, such as in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, adult baptism by immersion in water, is carried out. This practice differs from most other Quaker branches of the Religious Society of Friends. , EFCI claims to represent more than 140,000 Friends, equalling roughly 39% of the total number of Friends worldwide.|$|E
