25|$|The passage {{into the}} afterlife is shown as a brightly lit scene towards which the newly {{deceased}} is drawn. The portal {{is unique to}} each soul: for a child, it may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> carnival, but for a yoga master, {{it may be a}} Deva beckoning from within a Divine Lotus. Souls cannot be forced to enter the portals, so part of the reapers' job is to convince them to do so.|$|E
25|$|Once on {{the terrace}} of the Sutaungpyei Pagoda, a {{panoramic}} view of the Mandalay plain stretches far to the horizon, with the old city walls and moat, the Thudhamma Zayats (rest houses), various stupas around such as the Kuthodaw Pagoda and its 729 satellite stupas each housing a page inscribed in stone the world's largest book (the entire Pali Buddhist Canon), Kyauktawgyi Buddha Temple and Sandamuni Pagoda, the Irrawaddy to the west and the Minwun Hills on its opposite bank, the road to Madaya and Mogok to the north, and the Shan Yoma range of mountains to the east. There is yet a final stop down the northern slope immediately after the Sutaungpyei Pagoda called the Mwegyi hnakaung (Two Great Snakes) Pagoda. It has the images of two great cobras that were believed to frequent the hill to pay their obeisance to the Buddha and above these images seated are those of two Nats that they became when they died. Pilgrims stuff bank notes in the cobras' mouths and pray. The Champac, with its fragrant white blossoms on branches like candelabra, grows wild on the hill, along with the crimson red flowers over the feathery foliage of the Flame tree. Sunset over the river and the western hills as seen from Mandalay Hill can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> experience, and crowds of tourists may be encountered in the evenings enjoying it.|$|E

[...] "We had never been involved romantically but I knew her well enough to know she would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> mother and so I said I would like to be the father of her children." [...] A daughter was born in 1990, and another in 1992. Then another friend said she'd like to have children: [...] "And we agreed to have a baby." [...] Their son was born within weeks of his daughter in 1992.|$|E
500|$|According to {{one city}} {{development}} leader, Citygarden has prompted {{many people to}} visit downtown St. Louis. The executive of a local community improvement organization said the garden has {{also contributed to the}} city's economy. In addition, the popularity of Citygarden has led to renewed interest in renovating the 16-block Gateway Mall. Slay said, [...] "By setting the bar so high, it gives us reason to hope that the entire Gateway Mall will eventually fulfill the dreams that civic planners have had for it {{for the better part of}} a century.

New York Times journalist Jon Caramanica wrote that the record suffers from a difficult second half on what is otherwise [...] "as insular and micro as ambitious pop music can <b>be</b> ... <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> experiment {{in the power of}} absence." [...] Arnold Pan from PopMatters was more critical, calling it monotonous and [...] "an exercise in delayed gratification", while Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times panned the lyrics as [...] "one-dimensional planes floating through the group's oft-glorious 3-D spaces".|$|E

500|$|The maniacal {{schoolmaster}} was {{voiced by}} Waters, and actress Trudy Young supplied the groupie's voice. Backing vocals were {{performed by a}} range of artists, although a planned appearance by the Beach Boys on [...] "The Show Must Go On" [...] and [...] "Waiting for the Worms" [...] was cancelled by Waters, who instead settled for Beach Boy Bruce Johnston and Toni Tennille. [...] Ezrin's suggestion to release [...] "Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2" [...] as a single with a disco-style beat did not initially find favour with Gilmour, although Mason and Waters were more enthusiastic. Waters was opposed {{to the idea of}} releasing a single at all, but became more receptive once he listened to Ezrin and Guthrie's mix of the song. With two identical verses the song was felt to be lacking, and so a copy was sent to Griffiths in London with a request to find children to perform several versions of the lyrics. Griffiths contacted Alun Renshaw, head of music at the nearby Islington Green school, who was enthusiastic about the idea, saying: [...] "I wanted to make music relevant to the kids – not just sitting around listening to Tchaikovsky. I thought the lyrics were great – [...] "We don't need no education, we don't need no thought control..." [...] I just thought it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> experience for the kids." ...|$|E

[...] "This was a tough one", said showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss about the casting. [...] "The Red Viper is sexy and charming, yet believably dangerous; {{intensely}} likable, yet driven by hate. The boys love him, the girls love him, and he loves them all back. Unless your last name is Lannister. We found a fellow who can handle the job description and make it seem effortless. He wasn't easy to find and he won't be easy to stop". Martin commented on the casting by saying: [...] "I wasn't present for Pedro Pascal's audition, but I understand that he really killed it with his reading. And since his casting was announced, the producer of another TV show on which he appeared recently has written me to say how terrific Pascal is, and to congratulate us on the casting.
