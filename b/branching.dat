5|$|The {{respiratory}} tract has a <b>branching</b> structure {{like that of}} a tree. In the embryo this structure is developed in the process of <b>branching</b> morphogenesis, and is generated by the repeated splitting of the tip of the branch. In the development of the lungs (as in some other organs) the epithelium forms <b>branching</b> tubes.The lung has a left-right symmetry and each bud known as a bronchial bud grows out as a tubular epithelium that becomes a bronchus. Each bronchus branches into bronchioles. The <b>branching</b> {{is a result of the}} tip of each tube bifurcating. The <b>branching</b> process forms the bronchi, bronchioles, and ultimately the alveoli. The four genes mostly associated with <b>branching</b> morphogenesis in the lung are the intercellular signalling protein – sonic hedgehog (SHH), fibroblast growth factors FGF10 and FGFR2b, and bone morphogenetic protein BMP4. FGF10 is seen to have the most prominent role. FGF10 is a paracrine signalling molecule needed for epithelial <b>branching,</b> and SHH inhibits FGF10. The development of the alveoli is influenced by a different mechanism whereby continued bifurcation is stopped and the distal tips become dilated to form the alveoli.|$|E
