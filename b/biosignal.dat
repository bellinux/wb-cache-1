50|$|The {{attempts}} to amplify <b>biosignal</b> {{started with the}} development of electrocardiography. In 1887, Augustus Waller, a British physiologist, successfully measured the electrocardigraphy of his dog using two buckets of saline, in which each of the front paws and the hind paws was submerged. After a few months, Waller successfully recorded the first human electrocardiography using the capillary electrometer. Although, Waller did not envision that the electrocardiography would be used in healthcare extensibly, {{at the time of his}} invention. The electrocardiography did not have a practical usability until Willem Einthoven, a Dutch physiologist, coined the way to use the string galvanometer in cardiac signal amplification. Significant improvements in amplifier led to the usage of smaller electrodes that would be more easily attached to body parts. In the 1920s, the way to electrically amplify the cardiac signals was introduced, using vacuum tubes, which quickly replaced the string galvanometer that amplified the signal mechanically. The Vacuum tubes had larger impedance, so the amplification was more robust. Also, its relatively small size compared to the string galvanometer also contributed the widespread of the vacuum tube. Also, the large metal buckets were no longer needed, as much smaller metal-plate electrodes were introduced. By the 1930s, the electrocardiogram devices could be carried to the patient's home for the purpose of bedside monitoring. With the emergence of electronic amplification, it was quickly discovered that many features of the electrocardiography were revealed with various electrode placement.|$|E

30|$|This {{research}} {{proposes a}} generic methodology for dimensionality reduction upon time–frequency representations {{applied to the}} classification {{of different types of}} <b>biosignals.</b> The methodology directly deals with the highly redundant and irrelevant data contained in these representations, combining a first stage of irrelevant data removal by variable selection, with a second stage of redundancy reduction using methods based on linear transformations. The study addresses two techniques that provided a similar performance: the first one is based on the selection of a set of the most relevant time–frequency points, whereas the second one selects the most relevant frequency bands. The first methodology needs a lower quantity of components, leading to a lower feature space; but the second improves the capture of the time-varying dynamics of the signal, and therefore provides a more stable performance. In order to evaluate the generalization capabilities of the methodology proposed it has been applied to two types of <b>biosignals</b> with different kinds of non-stationary behaviors: electroencephalographic and phonocardiographic <b>biosignals.</b> Even when these two databases contain samples with different degrees of complexity and a wide variety of characterizing patterns, the results demonstrate a good accuracy for the detection of pathologies, over 98 %.

40|$|Monitoring {{multiple}} <b>biosignals,</b> such {{as heart}} rate, respiration cycle, and weight transitions, {{contributes to the}} health management of individuals. Specifically, {{it is possible to}} measure multiple <b>biosignals</b> using load information obtained through contact with the environment, such as a chair and bed, in daily use. A wide-range load sensor is essential since load information contains multiple <b>biosignals</b> with various load ranges. In this study, a load sensor is presented by using a quartz crystal resonator (QCR) with a wide measurement range of 1. 5 × 106 (0. 4 mN to 600 N), and its temperature characteristic of load is improved to − 7 Hz/°C (− 18 mN/°C). In order to improve the measurement range of the load, a design method of this sensor is proposed by restraining the buckling of QCR and by using a thinner QCR. The proposed sensor allows a higher allowable load with high sensitivity. The load sensor mainly consists of three layers, namely a QCR layer and two holding layers. As opposed to the conventional holding layer composed of silicon, quartz crystal is utilized for the holding layers to improve the temperature characteristic of the load sensor. In the study, multiple <b>biosignals,</b> such as weight and pulse, are detected by using a fabricated sensor...|$|R

40|$|Mobile patient {{monitoring}} {{refers to}} continuous or frequent measurement {{and analysis of}} <b>biosignals</b> of a patient by employing mobile computing and wireless communication technologies ‐ irrespective of patient’s location. Some of the common <b>biosignals</b> are ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG), MagnetoEncephaloGram (MEG), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), ElectroCardioGram (ECG) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV). Common problems observed during the trials of mobile patient monitoring systems are as follows: 1) Due to patient mobility and wireless networks availability changes, continuity of patient monitoring is affected; 2) The QoS offered by currently deployed wireless networks is variable ‐ and hence {{it may not be}} sufficient to transmit higher amount of <b>biosignals</b> data; and 3) The duration of a mobile patient monitoring session is affected due to limited battery capacity of a mobile device.

40|$|AbstractPhysiological devices (PDs) like upright bicycles, steppers and treadmills act as Human Machine Interface (HMI) during rehabilitation.

The selected model is chosen based on a minimum error produced by two Goodness-of-Fit (GOF) tests namely Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, D and Anderson Darling statistic, A 2. As a result, a Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution is found the most appropriate distribution compared to Generalized Pareto (GP) and Exponential (EXP) distributions for describing the EMG and EEG signals...|$|R
