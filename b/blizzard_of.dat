5|$|Carroll's tenure {{was plagued}} by disasters, both natural and man-made. Flooding struck {{in the eastern part}} of the state and in the state capitol of Frankfort. Extreme cold gripped the entire state in 1977 and 1978, {{including}} the Great <b>Blizzard</b> <b>of</b> 1978. Two mine explosions in Letcher County killed 26 people, and the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire claimed 165 lives. Many of these disasters led to stricter enforcement of safety laws. Carroll formed the Department of Housing, Buildings, and Construction and strengthened the state fire marshal's office.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>Blizzard</b> <b>of</b> 1996, on January 6, a Metro {{operator}} {{was killed}} when a train failed {{to stop at the}} Shady Grove station. The four-car train overran the station platform and struck an unoccupied train that was awaiting assignment. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation found that the crash was a result of a failure in the train's computer-controlled braking system. The NTSB recommended that Metro grant train operators the ability to manually control the braking system, even in inclement weather, and recommended that Metro prohibit parked rail cars on tracks used by incoming outbound trains.|$|E
5|$|In March 1888, while Mansfield's {{company was}} touring, Daniel E. Bandmann staged a {{competing}} production {{with the same}} name at Niblo's Garden. Bandmann's opening night (March 12) coincided with the Great <b>Blizzard</b> <b>of</b> 1888, and only five theatergoers braved the storm. One of the attendees was Sullivan, who was checking his competition. Bandmann's production inspired a letter from Stevenson to the New York Sun saying that only the Mansfield version was authorized and paying him royalties.|$|E

5|$|The {{storm had}} several {{long-term}} consequences. Complaints against the USDA Weather Bureau of alleged unpreparedness resulted in increased efforts to achieve more accurate weather forecasting and faster realization and communication of proper storm warnings. Criticism of the shipping companies and shipbuilders {{led to a}} series of conferences with insurers and mariners to seek safer designs for vessels. This resulted in the construction of ships with greater stability and more longitudinal strength. Immediately following the <b>blizzard</b> <b>of</b> Cleveland, Ohio, the city began a campaign to move all utility cables underground, in tubes beneath major streets. The project took half a decade.|$|E

5|$|As governor, Carroll {{increased}} funding {{for public education}} and promoted the use of coal {{as a means of}} alleviating the 1973 energy crisis. He also oversaw a major reorganization of the state's judicial system following voters' approval of a constitutional amendment in 1975. Many natural and man-made disasters occurred during his term in office, including the Great <b>Blizzard</b> <b>of</b> 1978 and the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire, leading to better safety practices and stricter law enforcement in the state. When Carroll left office, both he and his predecessor were under the cloud of an investigation for an alleged insurance kickback scheme, but Carroll was not convicted of any wrongdoing. In 2004, {{he was elected to the}} Kentucky Senate. Re-elected in 2008 and 2012, he won a fourth term without opposition in 2016.|$|E

5|$|The Great <b>Blizzard</b> <b>of</b> 1888 helped {{demonstrate}} {{the benefits of}} an underground transportation system. A plan {{for the construction of}} the subway was approved in 1894, and construction began in 1900. The first underground line of the subway opened on October 27, 1904, almost 36 years after the opening of the first elevated line in New York City, which became the IRT Ninth Avenue Line. The fare was $0.05 and on the first day the trains carried over 150,000 passengers. The oldest structure still in use opened in 1885 as part of the BMT Lexington Avenue Line in Brooklyn and is now part of the BMT Jamaica Line. The oldest right-of-way, {{which is part of the}} BMT West End Line near Coney Island Creek, was in use in 1864 as a steam railroad called the Brooklyn, Bath and Coney Island Rail Road.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{participated in}} the {{recovery}} efforts following the Great Lakes <b>Blizzard</b> <b>of</b> 1977. Over 300 members of the unit were dispatched to New York State to help with recovery efforts. As requirements and the engineer force structure changed, the brigade inactivated the combat heavy battalion in 1987 and activated another combat airborne battalion. In 1989, the 30th Engineer Battalion (Topographic) {{was added to the}} brigade. Over the years, the brigade has provided engineer support to XVIII Airborne Corps and other Army commands. In addition to training, it has deployed in support of operations across the entire spectrum of conflict from disaster relief to combat operations.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{has said}} the rescue efforts of Army National Guard during the Northeastern United States <b>blizzard</b> <b>of</b> 1978 {{impressed}} him. He joined the Massachusetts Army National Guard when he was 19, receiving his basic training at Fort Dix, New Jersey, and attending Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) classes at the campus of Northeastern University. He was trained in infantry, quartermaster, and airborne duties, and in 1994 he joined the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG). He {{was active in the}} Guard for 35 years rising to the rank of colonel. As the Army National Guard's head defense attorney in New England, Brown defended Guard members who had disciplinary difficulties such as positive drug tests, and provided estate planning and real estate advice to those who were about to deploy to war zones. He spent ten days to two weeks with the Guard in Kazakhstan and a week in Paraguay.|$|E

5|$|The opening {{years of}} the 1980s saw a number of changes in {{personnel}} and direction of established hard rock acts, including the deaths of Bon Scott, the lead singer of AC/DC, and John Bonham, drummer with Led Zeppelin. Whereas Zeppelin broke up almost immediately afterwards, AC/DC pressed on, recording the album Back in Black (1980) with their new lead singer, Brian Johnson. It became the fifth-highest-selling album of all time in the US and the second-highest-selling album in the world. Black Sabbath had split with original singer Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 and replaced him with Ronnie James Dio, formerly of Rainbow, giving the band a new sound and a period of creativity and popularity beginning with Heaven and Hell (1980). Osbourne embarked on a solo career with <b>Blizzard</b> <b>of</b> Ozz (1980), featuring American guitarist Randy Rhoads. Some bands, such as Queen, moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock, while others, including Rush with Moving Pictures (1981), began {{to return to a}} hard rock sound. The creation of thrash metal, which mixed heavy metal with elements of hardcore punk from about 1982, particularly by Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth and Slayer, helped to create extreme metal and further remove the style from hard rock, although a number of these bands or their members would continue to record some songs closer to a hard rock sound. Kiss moved away from their hard rock roots toward pop metal: firstly removing their makeup in 1983 for their Lick It Up album, and then adopting the visual and sound of glam metal for their 1984 release, Animalize, both of which marked a return to commercial success. Pat Benatar {{was one of the first}} women to achieve commercial success in hard rock, with three successive Top 5 albums between 1980 and 1982.|$|E
25|$|Extreme snow {{is often}} {{associated}} with a nor'easter, such as the <b>Blizzard</b> <b>of</b> '78 and the <b>Blizzard</b> <b>of</b> 1993, when several feet accumulated across portions of the state over 24 to 48 hours.

Like the <b>Blizzard</b> <b>of</b> 1996, this winter storm does not meet the criteria to be called a blizzard, however. The winds were not strong enough, and visibility was not poor enough. Thundersnow, which is a rare occurrence in New York, occurred for about a 4-hour period in parts of Bronx, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Rockland and Westchester during the height of the storm early Sunday morning.|$|E
