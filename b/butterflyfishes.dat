5|$|Lek breeding, where males congregate {{to display}} to females, has been {{recorded}} {{in at least one}} species Cyrtocara eucinostomus. Lek-like breeding systems have also been recorded in several other species. In monogamous species, males and females may form pair bonds and breed exclusively with their partners. This occurs in North American freshwater catfishes, many <b>butterflyfishes,</b> sea horses and several other species. Courtship in teleosts plays a role in species recognition, strengthening pair bonds, spawning site position and gamete release synchronisation. This includes colour changes, sound production and visual displays (fin erection, rapid swimming, breaching), which is often done by the male. Courtship may be done by a female to overcome a territorial male that would otherwise drive her away.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{the primary}} food source of <b>butterflyfishes</b> are the coral polyps {{themselves}} or the appendages of polychaetes {{and other small}} invertebrate animals. Their mouths protrude like forceps, and are equipped with fine teeth {{that allow them to}} nip off such exposed body parts of their prey. Parrotfishes eat algae growing on reef surfaces, utilizing mouths like beaks well adapted to scrape off their food. Other fish, like snapper, are generalized feeders with more standard jaw and mouth structures that allow them to forage {{on a wide range of}} animal prey types, including small fishes and invertebrates.|$|E
500|$|Mantas visit {{cleaning}} stations on {{coral reefs}} {{for the removal}} of external parasites. The ray adopts a near-stationary position close to the coral surface for several minutes while the cleaner fish consume the attached organisms. Such visits most frequently occur when the tide is high. In Hawaii, wrasses provide the cleaning; some species feed around the manta's mouth and gill slits while others address {{the rest of the body}} surface. In Mozambique, sergeant major fish clean the mouth while <b>butterflyfishes</b> concentrate on bite wounds. M. alfredi ...|$|E
