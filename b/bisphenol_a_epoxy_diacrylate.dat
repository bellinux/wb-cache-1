40|$|Lignin {{derivative}} vanillin when {{coupled with}} diamines and diethyl phosphite followed by reaction with echichlorohydrin yields high-performance flame retardant epoxy resins. Biorenewable and environment-friendly flame retardant alternatives to <b>bisphenol</b> <b>A</b> <b>epoxy</b> resins (having plenty of {{applications such as}} coatings, adhesives, composites, etc.) have captured great attention due to their ecological and economic necessity. Vanillin, an industrial scale monoaromatic compound from lignin, is a promising sustainable candidate for highperformance polymers, while synthesis of diepoxies is challenging. Meanwhile, bio-based epoxy resins combining high performance and excellent fire resistance {{are more difficult to}} be achieved. In this paper, two novel bio-based epoxy monomers EP 1 and EP 2 were synthesized by one-pot reaction containing Schiff base formation and phosphorus hydrogen addition between vanillin, diamines, and diethyl phosphite, followed by reacting with epichlorohydrin. Their reactivities are similar to <b>bisphenol</b> <b>A</b> <b>epoxy</b> resin DGEBA. After curing they showed excellent flame retardancy with UL- 94 VO rating and high LOI of similar to 32. 8 %, which was due to the outstanding intumescent and dense char formation ability.

Carbon fiber reinforced plastics consist mostly of epoxy resins and carbon fibers.

The phenolic resins employed are (a) novolac resins derived from phenol/formaldehyde (PN) and cardanol/ formaldehyde (CDN) condensation and (b) condensation products of cardanol–phenol mixtures with formaldehyde (CPNs). Cardanol {{is the main}} constituent of cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL), <b>a</b> renewable resource. <b>Epoxy</b> resins containing 2. 5 – 20 wt % of the above novolacs are prepared and tested for mechanical properties, water absorption, etc. Blends containing 5 – 10 wt % of novolacs show substantial improvement in properties.

The stoichiometric ratio between phenolic material and formaldehyde in the novolacs is optimized (1 : 0. 8) for maximum property enhancement. Among the novolacs studied, those prepared from cardanol–phenol mixtures of different molar ratios (CPNs) yield comparatively higher energy absorption at break and this property increases with increase in cardanol content in the modifier resin up to 40 %.

DAPP was blended with regular <b>bisphenol</b> <b>A</b> <b>epoxy</b> acrylate (BAEA) in various ratios to yield various phosphorus contents. The TGA-IR (thermogravimetric analyzer interface with an infrared spectrometer) results demonstrate that compounding 30 mol % DAPP with BAEA significantly reduced {{the amount of}} released CO gas.

The limiting oxygen index (LOI), reaching the saturated value of 26, and the heat release rate (HRR) measured using a cone-calorimeter, 156. 43 KW/m 2, confirm the saturation point when 30 mol % DAPP was compounded into BAEA. A study of the kinetics of pyrolysis reveals that Ea decreases as the phosphorus content increases.

The glass transition temperature (Tg) and thermal stability were decreased with increase in the percentage incorporation of CMDI. The thermomechanical properties of caprolactam blocked methylenediphenyl diisocyanate toughened epoxy resin were increased by increasing the percentage incorporation of bismaleimide. The values of impact strength for epoxy resin were increased with increase in the percentage concentration of CMDI. The homogeneous morphology of CMDI toughened epoxy resin and bismaleimide modified CMDI toughened epoxy resin system was ascertained from scanning electron microscope (SEM) ...|$|R
40|$|Epoxy resin with {{magnesium}} oxide filler has already shown a reduced space charge accumulation compared to neat epoxy and composites with other nanofillers. This paper addresses {{the changes in}} the structure due to the introduction of surface functionalized nano-MgO into polymers and possible explanations for the unique dielectric behavior. Short term DC breakdown tests were performed alongside space charge measurement and dielectric spectroscopy. The breakdown strength was measured for negative DC voltages with Rogowski shaped electrodes immersed in oil, in order to prevent surface flashover. The base polymer is <b>a</b> commercially available <b>bisphenol</b> <b>A</b> <b>epoxy</b> with anhydrite hardener. As filler material we use {{magnesium oxide}} powder with an average particle size of 22 nm and alumina filler with 50 nm average diameter as comparison. The particles were surface modified with a silane coupling agent, in order to achieve a uniform dispersion of particles in the host material. Neat epoxy samples were used as a reference. It is shown that the superior space charge behavior did not reflect on the short term DC breakdown strength however. MgO-epoxy exhibited better short term breakdown results than neat epoxy, but lower breakdown values than epoxy filled with nano alumina...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid sol-gel {{processing}} of inorganic-organic nanocomposites {{has been of}} a great interest over the last decades for being advantageous compared to the conventional addition methods of nanoparticles. In this study, a three-component system was adopted experiencing the design and preparation of different hybrid ceramic coatings based on Diglycidyl ether of <b>Bisphenol</b> <b>A</b> (<b>Epoxy)</b> and 3 -Glycidyloxypropyl trimethyloxysilane (GLYMO) by sol-gel technique. The obtained hybrid coatings were cured using different hardeners, Diethylene triamine (DETA) as an organic linker and 3 -Aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) as an inorganic/organic linker. Microstructure assessment and the morphology of the prepared hybrids was investigated using FTIR and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) respectively. Mechanical properties (adhesion, and hardness) were determined. The degree of hydrophilicity of the hybrids was assigned depending on the contact angle measurements. Moreover, the thermal properties were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The {{results showed that the}} silica content {{plays an important role in}} determining the morphology as well as the mechanical, physical, and thermal properties of the coatings. The results showed an improvement in most of the properties of the hybrid coatings with increasing the silica content up to a certain extent. However, further increase in the silica content, leads to a clear deterioration...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{insulation}} {{based on}} epoxy resin {{is commonly used}} in high voltage applications. Examples are transformers, terminations, plugs or connectors. But, it is also used in high voltage applications where energy transportation or distribution is not the main purpose, e. g. in medical and industrial X-ray systems, or radar. This paper addresses {{the changes in the}} structure due to the introduction of surface functionalized nanoscale particles, namely magnesium oxide and aluminum oxide. Short term DC breakdown tests were performed alongside dielectric spectroscopy. The BD strength was measured for negative DC ramp voltages. Dielectric properties have been acquired by broadband dielectric spectroscopy. The base polymer is <b>a</b> commercially available <b>bisphenol</b> <b>A</b> <b>epoxy</b> with anhydrite hardener. As filler material magnesium oxide powder was used with an average particle size of 22 nm and alumina filler with 50 nm average diameter. Both particle types were modified with a silane coupling agent, in order to achieve a uniform dispersion of particles in the host material. Neat epoxy samples were used as a reference. Both composites showed remarkable DC breakdown strength for low fillgrades. A possible explanation for this unique behavior is given and the differences between samples filled with aluminum oxide and magnesium oxide are discussed...|$|R
