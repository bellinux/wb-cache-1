5|$|Canada was {{transferred}} to the 1st Battle Squadron on 12 June 1916. In 1917–18, she was fitted with better rangefinders and range dials, and two of the aft 6-inch secondary guns were removed after they suffered <b>blast</b> <b>damage</b> from the middle 14-inch turret. In the latter year, flying-off platforms for aircraft were added atop the superfiring turrets fore and aft. Canada was put into the reserve fleet in March 1919.|$|E
5|$|The Brandenburg-class {{ships were}} the {{foundation}} of what eventually became the High Seas Fleet. As they represented {{a shift in the}} strategic outlook of the German navy, the traditional method of ship construction, which relied heavily on foreign models, was abandoned. Some experimentation was implemented in the design process, particularly in the armor types that were installed on the ships. Brandenburg and Wörth were equipped with compound armor that consisted of several layers of different materials, while the latter two ships received Harvey nickel-steel alloy armor plating. The addition of a third main battery turret was also a significant innovation. While a novel concept, the midships turret caused prohibitive <b>blast</b> <b>damage</b> to the surrounding superstructure when fired, which led to the idea being abandoned. This arrangement has led some authors to characterize the ships as proto-dreadnoughts. This is incorrect, as the guns were not of the same length, and the ships were designed to fight at close range, unlike the later dreadnought battleships.|$|E
5|$|The 12"/50 was a Bethlehem development. It {{was most}} likely based on the weapon used in the United States' , the 12"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun. The twelve guns were mounted in six twin turrets. Four turrets were superfiring fore and aft, while {{the other two were}} located en echelon in wing turrets. The latter weapons could, in theory, fire on a ° range on their {{respective}} sides of the hull and ° on the other, but in reality this was not possible, as the <b>blast</b> <b>damage</b> from the weapons would damage the ship. A more reasonable estimate would be ° on their sides. The 6-inch secondary armament was placed in casemates, with six {{on either side of the}} ship. For protection, they were provided with 6inches of armor. The 4-inch weaponry, intended for use against marauding destroyers, was mounted unarmored in various places around the ship, including the main deck, superstructure, and far up near the bow. As originally built, there were sixteen 4-inch guns, but four of those were replaced with four 3-inch AA guns and four 3-pounders during the 1924-1926 modernization. The torpedo tubes were located underneath the waterline and were loaded in a dedicated compartment.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of these {{changing}} priorities, Maine was caught between two separate positions and could not perform either one adequately. She lacked both the armor and firepower to serve as a ship-of-the-line against enemy battleships and the speed to serve as a cruiser. Nevertheless, she was expected to fulfill more than one tactical function. In addition, because of the potential of a warship sustaining <b>blast</b> <b>damage</b> to herself from cross-deck and end-on fire, Maines main-gun arrangement was obsolete by the time she entered service.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{open pit}} studies where <b>blasting</b> <b>damage</b> intro-duced {{in the remaining}} rock has been investigated. Results from two open pit mines are described and discussed. Parallel performed labo-ratory experiments, where simulated <b>blasting</b> <b>damage</b> has been intro-duced into samples before shear strength testing took place, are also reviewed. These studies are tied together in order to throw some light upon how the <b>blasting</b> <b>damage</b> influences the slope stability. A mathematical model is also described which {{will make it possible}} to optimize the blast design for a specified damage zone in the rock mass. IJ: A slope stability analysis based on a detailed line survey, in-vestigations of joint set characteristics, rock mechanics investi-gations, ground water flow measurements, interpretations of data and statistical analysis will express a certain probability for slope failure connected to the slope an 6 le. The most significant visually observ::::cl damage caused by a stock blast is the resulting backbreak. By practising simple arithiT,etics anyone easily can translate the average noticed backbreak to a theoretical maximum slope angle assuming a certain working width of berms for access.

50|$|Quarring {{techniques}} {{had changed}} since the miners initial quarrying of the mid-1880s with blasting being replaced with equipment to drill and cut.

25|$|Despite these advances, Maine {{was out of}} date by {{the time}} she entered service, due to her {{protracted}} construction period and changes in the role of ships of her type, naval tactics and technology. It took nine years to complete, and nearly three years for the armor plating alone. The general use of steel in warship construction precluded the use of ramming without danger to the attacking vessel. The potential for <b>blast</b> <b>damage</b> from firing end on or cross-deck discouraged en échelon gun placement. The changing role of the armored cruiser from a small, heavily armored substitute for the battleship to a fast, lightly armored commerce raider also hastened her obsolescence. Despite these disadvantages, Maine was seen as an advance in American warship design.|$|E
25|$|Aircraft {{carriers}} use {{jet blast}} deflectors {{at the rear}} of aircraft catapults, positioned to protect other aircraft from exhaust <b>blast</b> <b>damage.</b> Jet blast deflectors are made of heavy duty material that is raised and lowered by hydraulic cylinders or linear actuators. The jet blast deflector lies flush with and serves as a portion of the flight deck until the aircraft to be launched rolls over it {{on the way to the}} catapult. When the aircraft is clear of the deflector, the heavy panel is raised into position to redirect the hot jet blast. As soon as the deflector is raised, another aircraft can be brought into position behind it, and flight deck personnel can perform final readiness duties without the danger of hot, violent exhaust gases. Such systems were installed on aircraft carriers in the late 1940s and early 1950s, as jet-powered aircraft began to appear in navies.|$|E
500|$|Dreadnought {{could deliver}} a {{broadside}} of eight guns between 60° before the beam and 50° [...] the beam. Beyond these limits she could fire six guns aft, and four forward.

3000|$|The post-blast {{residual}} axial {{capacity of}} RC columns {{is closely related}} to the <b>blast</b> <b>damages</b> of concrete material. As stated in Sect.  2, the <b>blast</b> <b>damages</b> show pathological sensitivity to the mesh size, which directly results in the mesh-dependent residual axial capacity. The integral type nonlocal model provides a fully regularization for the strain softening problem through introducing a characteristic length in the local constitutive laws (Pijaudier-Cabot and Bažant 1987), which is achieved by weighted spatial averaging of a suitable state variable. Generally, state variables such as the damage energy release rate, damage value, total strain and equivalent strain are chosen for applying the nonlocal formulation. In this paper, the equivalent strain in Mazars damage model is taken as the nonlocal state variable, and with its nonlocal counterpart replacing ε_eq in Eq. (5), which is defined as [...]...|$|R

500|$|The Hiroshima {{firestorm}} {{was roughly}} [...] in diameter, corresponding {{closely to the}} severe <b>blast</b> <b>damage</b> zone. (See the USSBS map, right.) Blast-damaged buildings provided fuel for the fire. Structural lumber and furniture were splintered and scattered about. Debris-choked roads obstructed fire fighters. Broken gas pipes fueled the fire, and broken water pipes rendered hydrants useless. At Nagasaki, the fires failed to merge into a single firestorm, and the fire-damaged area was only one fourth as great as at Hiroshima, {{due in part to}} a southwest wind that pushed the fires away from the city.|$|E
500|$|Witnesses {{many miles}} from the {{terminal}} observed flames hundreds of feet high; the smoke cloud was visible from space, and from {{as far north as}} Lincolnshire (about [...] ) away.

40|$|For {{limiting}} the damage range caused by explosive shock loads in vertical crater retreat (VCR) mining, the <b>blasting</b> <b>damage</b> characteristics of surrounding rock were studied by two methods: numerical simulation and ultrasonic testing.

500|$|Like Neptune, {{the wing}} turrets of the Colossus-class ships were {{staggered}} [...] "en echelon" [...] {{so that all}} five turrets could shoot on the broadside, although in practice the <b>blast</b> <b>damage</b> to the superstructure and boats made this impractical except in an emergency.

However, if the girders were damaged during combat, they could fall onto the turrets, immobilising them. The bridge and its associated compass platform was also situated above the conning tower, which similarly risked being obscured if the bridge collapsed.|$|E

Meanwhile, the ABDZ was divided into the pulverizing area, fractured area, and cracked area from the inside out. Besides, the model of the normal incidence of the impact stress waves in the ABDZ was established; the attenuation coefficient of the amplitude of the impact stress waves was obtained after it passed through the intact rock mass, and ABDZ, to the anchorage zone. In addition, a numerical simulation was used to study the dynamic response of the vertical stress and impact-induced vibration energy in the surrounding rocks. By doing so, the dissipation of the impact stress waves within the ABDZ of the surrounding rocks was revealed. As demonstrated in the field application, the establishment of the ABDZ in the surrounding rocks reduced the effect of the impact-induced vibration energy on the anchorage support system of the roadway...|$|R
