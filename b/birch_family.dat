40|$|Rodents and hares {{are very}} harmful pests in forest {{plantations}} in the Holarctic zone. No {{effective way to}} control damages by these pests is known. There is large variation in resistance of different birch species, origins and families. The resistance {{does not seem to}} be correlated to growth of seedlings, thus the prospects for resistance breeding are considered good. There seem to be large variation even within <b>birch</b> <b>families</b> which can partly be explained by morphological differences between seedlings. Also the nursery treatment seems to determine the palatability of seedlings to herbivores. Ways to produce resistant genotypes for the use of practical forestry are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the thesis was {{to find out how}} the wood quality differed among Silver birch provenances. The study was conducted in family, provenance and tree species experiments in SW Sweden. External features like stem straightness, spike knots, double leader, diameter, tree height, leaning and other defects were measured and analyzed. Significant differences were found between <b>birch</b> <b>families</b> and provenances for a number of measured parameters. In the family experiment, significant differences between families were found for the parameters straight trees and diameter while {{no significant differences were found}} for others measured parameters like spike knots, forking, leaning and tree height. The local provenance “Tönnersjöheden” had the best overall quality and growth in the provenance experiment while Kulbäcksliden provenance (North Sweden) had a low overall quality. In the tree species experiment, significant differences between provenances were only found for the frequency of straight and leaning trees. Asarum was suggested a good quality provenance with an overall high quality performance and a low percentage of leaning trees while Visingsö was judged a bad quality provenance with a high percentage of crooked stems and a many leaning trees...|$|R

40|$|While current {{production}} of ethanol as a biofuel relies on starch and sugar inputs, {{it is anticipated}} that sustainable {{production of}} ethanol for biofuel use will utilize lignocellulosic feedstocks. Candidate plant species {{to be used for}} lignocellulosic ethanol production include a large number of species within the Grass, Pine and <b>Birch</b> plant <b>families.</b> For these biofuel feedstock species, there are variable amounts of genome sequence resources available, ranging from complete genome sequences (e. g. sorghum, poplar) to transcriptome data sets (e. g. switchgrass, pine). These data sets are not only dispersed in location but also disparate in content. It will be essential to leverage and improve these genomic data sets for the improvement of biofuel feedstock production. The objectives of this project were to provide computational tools and resources for data-mining genome sequence/annotation and large-scale functional genomic datasets available for biofuel feedstock species. We have created a Bioenergy Feedstock Genomics Resource that provides a web-based portal or Ã¢ÂÂclearing houseÃ¢ÂÂ for genomic data for plant species relevant to biofuel feedstock production. Sequence data from a total of 54 plant species are included in the Bioenergy Feedstock Genomics Resource including model plant species that permit leveraging of knowledge across taxa to biofuel feedstock species. We have generated additional computational analyses of these data, including uniform annotation, to facilitate genomic approaches to improved biofuel feedstock production. These data have been centralized in the publicly available Bioenergy Feedstock Genomics Resource ([URL]...|$|R
60|$|The gate-warden of Knowsley Park {{was an old}} woman, who readily gave us {{admittance}} at Sir Thomas <b>Birch's</b> request. The <b>family</b> of the Earl of Derby is not now at the Park. It was a {{very bad}} time of year to see it; the trees just showing the earliest symptoms of vitality, while whole acres of ground were covered with large, dry, brown ferns,--which I suppose are very beautiful when green. Two or three hares scampered out of these ferns, and sat on their hind legs looking about them, as we drove by. A sheet of water had been drawn off, in order to deepen its bed. The oaks {{did not seem to}} me so magnificent as they should be in an ancient noble property like this. A century does not accomplish so much for a tree, in this slow region, as it does in ours. I think, however, that they were more individual and picturesque, with more character in their contorted trunks; therein somewhat resembling apple-trees. Our forest-trees have a great sameness of character, like our people,-- because one and the other grow too closely.|$|R
