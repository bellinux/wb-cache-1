5|$|Cairano's {{concentration}} on the Caesars is interrupted only briefly by {{the return of}} Tamagnino between 1499 and 1500. Tamagnino, likely based on his lauded works at the Certosa di Pavia, receives a commission for six different Caesars and other sculptures. <b>But</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> art scene increasingly monopolised by Cairano, who {{has come a long}} way from his naive expression of the Apostles, Tamagnino does not garner much attention, and, humiliated by the cold reception, he leaves Brescia, probably never to return.|$|E
5|$|Furious, Presto {{tries to}} attack Alec, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> act to defend himself, Alec puts an offstage ladder into the wizard hat, and Presto is hit between his legs. Presto {{attempts}} to hit Alec with it, but it misses and hits a backstage door, and Presto ends up getting pushed across the stage. Presto antagonizes Alec again, covering the carrot {{with a cloth}} before smashing it into a pulp {{with a piece of}} the ladder. Alec furiously retaliates by aiming the opening of the wizard's hat towards an electrical socket which Presto's fingers go into, shocking Presto into dancing wildly to bluegrass music.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln rarely raised {{objections}} in the courtroom; <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> 1859 case, {{where he}} defended a cousin, Peachy Harrison, {{who was accused}} of stabbing another to death, Lincoln angrily protested the judge's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client. Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as was expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling, allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison.|$|E

5|$|Dallin {{finished}} his models in August 1920 and the commission referred the designs to sculptor member James Earle Fraser. On examining Dallin's work, Fraser deemed the lettering crude, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> undated letter to Moore (probably late August) regretted {{that due to}} the tight timeline for production, there was no opportunity to make changes. He suggested that the Mint be urged to allow three months in future for CFA consideration. After the commission met on September 3, a letter to that effect {{was sent to the}} Director of the United States Mint, Raymond T. Baker. The letter was ignored, but the Treasury approved the designs.|$|E
5|$|In need of {{something}} silvera {{weakness of the}} djinnDean breaks into his mother's house to steal a sterling silver knife. However, he is caught by Sam, who thinks he's stealing from their mother. While Dean at first pretends that he needs the knife to repay a gambling debt, he eventually reveals the truth. Although Sam does not believe him, he accompanies his brother to the djinn's warehouse lair. There Dean discovers that the young woman he has been having visions of {{is a victim of}} the djinn. It's clear that she is alive <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> hallucinatory statea way for the djinn to keep its victims unresisting while it feedsDean realizes that he, too, is within an illusory world. Knowing that a person wakes up if he or she dies in a dream, he decides to kill himself. Carmen, Jessica, and his mother appear and try {{to talk him out of}} it. Dean resists the urge to stay, and awakens in the real world after stabbing himself. Sam, who is already in the warehouse trying to rescue him, is attacked by the djinn, but Dean kills the creature.|$|E
5|$|Most {{commonly}} {{employed as}} a right-handed opening batsman, Sainsbury was one of Somerset's most talented batsman during their formative years. His slow underarm bowling was effective in second-class cricket, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> era when overarm bowling was becoming the standard, he was used sparingly in the first-class game. During his time at Somerset, the county gained first-class status. After being led for three seasons by Sainsbury's Lansdown team-mate Stephen Newton, Sainsbury was given the Somerset captaincy for the 1885 season. A combination of poor results {{and not being able}} to raise a full eleven during that season led to the county's removal from the first-class game, although Sainsbury remained as captain until 1888. By the time Somerset had improved sufficiently to return to first-class cricket in 1891, Sainsbury had moved to neighbouring county Gloucestershire, where he saw out his county cricket career.|$|E

5|$|One of Frederick III's bodyguards, Statius, {{traveled}} to Scania {{to organize the}} peasants into Snapphane units and instigate anti-Swedish sentiment. In Malmö, a cabal of rich bourgeoisie, led by Bartholomaeus Mikkelsen, planned a revolt. The conspiracy tried to recruit one of Malmös two mayors, Efvert Wiltfang, {{but he would not}} commit himself to the uprising, even though he said he would support Frederick III. At the end of December, the Danes embarked on a foray into Scania, but were foiled by bad weather and poor navigation. Meanwhile, the Swedish authorities had become aware of the plot and the main leaders were arrested, among them Mikkelsen and Wildfang, and the conspirators were sentenced to death. On December 22, 1659 Mikkelsen and two others were beheaded, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attempt to placate the Scanian people the execution of Wiltfang and 10 others was stayed. The uprising had been averted, but rebels and insurgents continued to operate in the countryside.|$|E
5|$|Quinn (Dianna Agron) {{begins to}} doubt her {{decision}} to give her baby to Will's wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), and re-considers her stance on raising the baby with Puck (Mark Salling) instead of Finn (Cory Monteith). She tells Terri she wants to keep the baby, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> effort to change her mind, Terri's sister Kendra (Jennifer Aspen) has Quinn babysit her three unruly sons. Quinn invites Puck to babysit with her and the two bond, however when Quinn discovers that Puck spent the evening sexting his ex-girlfriend Santana (Naya Rivera), she re-commits to having the baby adopted, believing her daughter deserves a better father.|$|E
5|$|The sixth set of episodes also stayed {{below the}} 4 million mark, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> evening that saw ITV beat BBC One's {{audience}} {{share in the}} evening by 19.6% to 19%, including the earlier episode of Red of Black? gaining 3.8m viewers, while the later show was viewed by slightly more with 3.9m. However, in direct competition with the later show was BBC One's Would I Lie to You? which had slightly more viewers, with 4m tuning in. On the return of Red or Black? to Saturday night, the show climbed above 4 million {{for the first time}} in three days, to 4.63m for the first show and then up to 5.67m for the second. This enabled ITV to beat BBC One in the primetime ratings overall, by 23.3% to 21%, even though the first episode of series 8 of Strictly Come Dancing was broadcast on BBC. However Red or Black? individually placed behind both Strictly and Doctor Who, with the overnights for the BBC shows being 7.6 and 6.0 million, respectively. Overall through the week the main ITV channel had a higher share of the ratings during primetime than BBC One on five out of the seven occasions, a turnaround from the previous week where it only won on a single evening.|$|E
