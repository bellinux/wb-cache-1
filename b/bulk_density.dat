40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the real}} applicability of laser scanning techniques to determine <b>bulk</b> <b>densities</b> of fine grained soils. The method, fast and accurate, {{can be employed}} both {{in the field and}} laboratory.

Before calculating soil sample volumes, optimum conditions for data acquisition, exportation and post-processing were assessed. The laser scanning provides highly consistent results when compared with those obtained from Standard Proctor compaction tests. However, the study shows a limiting value of moisture content below which the laser scan provides inaccurate results. Likely, this limit varies from soil to soil and therefore the technique must be calibrated before being used to determine <b>bulk</b> <b>densities</b> and derived volumetric properties (i. e., porosity or void ratio).
