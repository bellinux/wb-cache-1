40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} three-dimensional (3 D) -constitutive models for concrete formulated {{in the framework of}} plasticity theory to structural analyses of <b>anchor</b> <b>devices.</b> For this purpose, two commonly employed concrete material models are considered. The first model, the extended Leon model, is based on one yield surface for the description of compressive and tensile failure of concrete. The second material model is a multisurface plasticity model consisting of three Rankine yield surfaces and a Drucker-Prager yield surface. The predictive capability of the models is demonstrated by means of <b>anchor</b> <b>devices,</b> commonly employed in structural engineering for the connection of steel and concrete members. Such devices induce strongly nonuniform triaxial stress states in the surrounding concrete, ranging from tensile, overcompressive, to confined compressive stress states. In the vicinity of the anchor head, even nearly hydrostatic stress states may occur. The numerical simulations {{on the basis of the}} employed 3 D material models for concrete give insight into the load-carrying behavior of the investigated <b>anchor</b> <b>devices.</b> Two headed studs characterized by different shapes of the anchor head and an undercut anchor are considered. Comparison of the peak loads and failure modes of the respective <b>anchor</b> <b>device</b> predicted by the numerical models with experimental data highlight the strength and weakness of the employed material models. It is shown that some load cases may lead to rather large differences in peak load depending on the choice of material model. These differences are based on the individual properties of the constitutive models for concrete and, hence, detailed knowledge of the model under consideration is essential for giving accurate estimates of the peak load of the <b>anchor</b> <b>device</b> and the failure mode of concrete...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the feasibility, reproducibility {{and efficacy of}} a new tissue <b>anchoring</b> <b>device</b> in a porcine survival model. METHODS: Gastrotomies were performed using a needle-knife and balloon dilator in 10 female Yorkshire pigs weighing 30 - 35 kg. Gastric closure was attempted using a new tissue <b>anchoring</b> <b>device.</b> The tightness of the closure was confirmed by means of air insufflation {{and the ability to}} maintain gastric distension with stability in peritoneal pressure measured with a Veress needle. All animals were monitored daily for signs of peritonitis and sepsis over 14 d. During necropsy, the peritoneal cavity and the gastric access site were examined. RESULTS: Transgastric access, closure and 14 d survival was achieved in all pigs. The mean closure time was 18. 1 ± 19. 2 min and a mean of 2. 1 ± 1 devices were used. Supplementary clips were necessary in 2 cases. The closure time was progressively reduced (24. 8 ± 13. 9 min in the first 5 pigs vs 11. 4 ± 5. 9 min in the last 5, P = NS). At necropsy, the gastric access site was correctly closed in all cases with all brace-bars present. One device was misplaced in the mesocolon. Minimal adhesions were observed in 3 pigs and signs of mild peritonitis and adhesions in one.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveThis {{study was}} {{performed}} to non-invasively visualize and characterize osteochondral (OC) repair in ex vivo goat stifles using an 8 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner and to compare the MR morphology with images obtained from 1. 5 T, gross morphology and histology. MethodsMature, neutered male goats were assigned to an 8 -week (n= 4) or 16 -week (n= 4) study period. Two cylindrical OC defects (7 mm diameter, full cartilage thickness and 1 mm into subchondral bone) were surgically created in the right stifle: one in the medial femoral condyle (MFC) {{and the other in}} the trochlear groove (TG). The implant matrices (non-woven or foam) were secured in the defect using a <b>bottom</b> <b>anchored</b> fixation <b>device</b> (FD). The contralateral left stifles served as time zero controls. At the day of necropsy, implants were placed at both defect sites (MFC and TG) on the normal left stifles. Following necropsy, the ex vivo goat stifles (intact and encapsulated) were disarticulated. Within 24 h postnecropsy, MR scans of the stifles along the mid-sagittal plane of the OC defect were acquired at 8 T and 1. 5 T. MR relaxation times, T 1 and T 2, were measured at the region of repair tissue (RT) and adjacent native cartilage. Immediately after MR imaging, the stifles were dissected, grossly examined, and a sagittal OC block corresponding to the MR region of interest was prepared for formalin fixation. ResultsThe high-resolution MR images enabled visualization of cartilage and bone integrity surrounding the implant as well as delineating the margins of RT/implant matrix and the FD. On spin echo sequence, the RT variably appeared as high, intermediate or low MR signal intensity; whereas, the FD always appeared as low signal intensity. In general, the MR signal intensity of 8 -week RT was slightly higher compared to 16 -week RT; however, {{there was no difference in}} RT morphology of stifles implanted with the non-woven matrix or foam matrix. Subchondral sclerosis appeared as low signal intensity. The 8 T MR images showed better delineation of the stifle tissues compared to the images acquired at 1. 5 T. The T 2 relaxation time of the RT appears to indicate (inconclusive due to small number of samples) a slight variation in the RT type between 8 weeks and 16 weeks. At both study times, the defects grossly appeared whitish to reddish but did not have the characteristic hyaline appearance typical of articular cartilage (AC). The gross appearance of the MFC and TG RT differed, which was predominantly mottled and recessed with fissuring of adjacent native AC in the MFC. Histologically, the RT of both 8 -week and 16 -week postsurgical defects predominantly comprised fibrovascular connective tissue with only few samples showing the presence of fibrocartilaginous and/or hypertrophic chondrocytes within the defect RT at 8 weeks. Also, compared to 8 -week, the 16 -week RT appeared to be more fibrotic. ConclusionUsing 8 T scanner, high-resolution MR images of ex vivo encapsulated goat stifles confirmed the capability of high-field MR imaging to distinguish the defect RT from the FD and adjacent joint tissues. The extent of OC repair and adjacent bone lesions (at 8 weeks and 16 weeks) observed in the MR images compared well with those observed on the corresponding histological sections...|$|R

40|$|Kosterhavet National Park, {{a marine}} {{protected}} area on the Swedish west coast, is a popular destination for tourists and attracts over half a million visitors annually. Many of the tourists arrive by boat, and the natural harbours are frequently visited. Boat presence may affect <b>bottom</b> substrates through <b>anchoring,</b> and pollution could also occur {{in the form of}} leaching antifouling paints, fuel residue (PAHs) and litter. This thesis set out to investigate if there are any lingering impacts resulting from boat tourism in Kosterhavet and suggests management efforts in those cases there are. Through studies using a video sledge, data from two consecutive years revealed visible anchor traces on soft un-vegetated bottoms, and number of traces were also linked to number of <b>bottom</b> <b>anchoring</b> boats. Furthermore, it was found that visitors engage in <b>bottom</b> <b>anchoring</b> at locations where sensitive habitats like eelgrass and oyster beds are located, which may result in harm to both habitat types. Sediment samples taken in both natural harbours and small marinas unexpectedly showed presence of long since banned antifouling products like TBT, but also more recently prohibited biocides like irgarol and diuron. This suggests that they are still in use. Moreover, water samples from the area show that the currently used antifouling compound copper, is likely to exceed threshold values set by the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM) during peak boat season. Concentrations of PAHs were found to be below threshold values for water, but they are also known to have low water solubility {{and are more likely to}} be bound to particles. From the video data, occurrence of seafloor litter was also obtained and data on beach litter from reference sites on the Swedish west coast was downloaded from the OSPAR beach litter database. Seafloor litter, in contradiction to beach litter, was at a much higher degree found to have an origin related to recreational activities. This suggest that beach litter stem from other activities in the park, or are brought to the area by currents. A threat analysis based on the leisure boat related threats; anchoring, antifouling, PAHs and litter were performed. The threats were analysed with respect to their potential impact on three soft bottom values; eelgrass, oysters and blue mussels. The sum of these threats showed that eelgrass was highly impacted by anchoring, but oysters were more severely affected when all threats were considered. This type of threat analysis can be of great value to park managers, as they need to make prioritizations regarding how to use their often limited resources. Based on these finding, it is, among others, suggested that <b>bottom</b> <b>anchoring</b> should not be allowed at locations where eelgrass and oyster beds occur, and that bottom friendly mooring solutions should be made available to avoid negative impact on these habitats. ...|$|R

40|$|Due {{to changes}} in the Swedish design code in 1994, timber {{construction}} is no longer limited to two-storey buildings. This change has created an attractive market for multi-storey timber structures. A Scandinavian glulam manufacturer, Moelven Töreboda, started in 2007 to develop a new beam and post building system in timber for multi-storey buildings with the Swedish commercial name, “trä 8 ”. For “trä 8 ”, the stabilising system is based on prefabricated wall panels placed at a few locations in the building. The stabilising elements consist of double sheathing of LVL Kerto-Q boards glued and screwed to a glulam frame. The panels are typically of 2. 4 m width and continuous up to four storey height. The elements are fixed to the foundation by using special <b>anchoring</b> <b>devices,</b> which include threaded rods glued-in lengthwise in the timber member. In this paper, an introductory experimental study of the efficiency of this prefabricated wall panel used as a stabilising element is reported. Experimental results from full-scale testing of the racking performance of the stabilising element including the <b>anchoring</b> <b>device</b> are presented. The study, which focuses on the stiffness and the serviceability state, demonstrates that the presented wall panel elements, as part of a beam and post system for multi-storey buildings, have the potential to provide the necessary horizontal stability for the building.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this part}} 2, the {{practical}} design {{and strength of}} a number of different joints is described: (1) Sheathing-to-framing joints – the plastic design method is {{based on the premise that}} the load-displacement relationship of the sheathing-to-framing joints has sufficiently large plastic deformation capacity; the sheathing-to-framing joints have great influence on the load-carrying capacity of the wall; (2) Stud-to-rail joints – by utilizing the shear capacity of the stud-to-rail joints, the plastic design method can be simplified and the load-carrying capacity can be increased; (3) Hold down devices for the (leading) stud – the capacity of the tying down force of the hold down determines whether the shear wall will act as fully or partially anchored; tying down the shear walls by connecting them to the transverse walls leads to a 3 -dimensioonal behaviour that is a very favourable for the load-carrying capacity and the stiffness of the shear wall; through transverse walls the anchoring of the leading stud can be reduced or eliminated (those types of transverse wall connections are not discussed in detail in this paper); and (4) <b>Anchoring</b> <b>devices</b> for the <b>bottom</b> rail – in partially anchored shear walls it is necessary that the <b>bottom</b> rail is <b>anchored</b> to the substrate against uplift.

In this study, we prospectively {{assessed}} the feasibility of using a magnetic anchoring and guidance system (MAGS) in laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery performed by novices. Materials and Methods: A total of 10 LESS simple nephrectomies were performed with or without MAGS in a nonsurvival porcine model by 6 operators with no previous LESS surgery experience. After installation of the homemade single port, an intra-abdominal magnet was fixed to the renal parenchyma with suturing and stabilized by an external magnet placed on the flank so that the position of the kidney could be easily changed by moving the external handheld magnet. The length of the procedure and any intraoperative complications were evaluated. Results: Operative time (mean±standard deviation) was shorter in the group using the magnetic <b>anchoring</b> <b>device</b> (M-LESS-N) than in the group with conventional LESS nephrectomy (C-LESS-N) (63 ± 20. 8 minutes vs. 82 ± 40. 7 minutes, respectively). Although all nephrectomies were completed uneventfully in the M-LESS-N group, renal vein injury occurred during dissection of the renal hilum in two cases of C-LESS-N and was resolved by simultaneous transection of the renal artery and vein with an Endo-GIA stapler.
