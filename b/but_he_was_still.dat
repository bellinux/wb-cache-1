5|$|Weinberg first {{attended}} Adelphi University, {{and later}} Seton Hall University, majoring in film studies. His general {{goal was to}} become a lawyer, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> most viscerally interested in a music career and kept his drum set in his car in case any chances to play arose. He performed at weddings, bar mitzvahs, and bars, then landed a job in the pit band for the Broadway musical Godspell.|$|E
5|$|As {{darkness}} fell, {{both sides}} took stock and made tentative plans for continuing the action. Admiral Fletcher, obliged {{to abandon the}} derelict Yorktown and feeling he could not adequately command from a cruiser, ceded operational command to Spruance. Spruance knew the United States had won a great victory, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> unsure of what Japanese forces remained and was determined to safeguard both Midway and his carriers. To aid his aviators, who had launched at extreme range, he had continued to close with Nagumo {{during the day and}} persisted as night fell.|$|E
5|$|Hudner begged {{superiors}} {{to allow}} him to return to the wreck to help extract Brown, but he was not allowed, as other officers feared an ambush of the vulnerable helicopters resulting in additional casualties. In order to prevent the body and the aircraft from falling into Chinese or North Korean hands, the U.S. Navy bombed the crash site with napalm two days later, reciting the Lord's Prayer over the radio as they watched Brown's body consumed by flames. The pilots observed that his body looked to have been disturbed and his clothes stolen, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> stuck in the aircraft. The remains of both Brown and the aircraft were never recovered. Brown was the first African American U.S. Navy officer killed in the war.|$|E

5|$|Johnson fell {{unconscious}} {{after this}} duel and was dragged from the battlefield; {{in addition to}} his five wounds, twenty other bullets had hit his horse and gear. But the war in the Northwest was over. Although there was no organized resistance to his presence in Canada, Harrison withdrew to Detroit because of supply problems. (The Canadians would not feed his men.) Johnson eventually recovered, except for a crippled hand, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> suffering from his wounds {{when he returned to the}} House in February 1814.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{continued}} in the ownership of Hamelin Plantagenet's family, passing to his son William de Warenne in 1202. William was probably responsible {{for the construction of}} new stone curtain walls around the inner bailey, destroying the former earthwork defences in the process. The inner bailey was levelled and William built a hall and service buildings inside the castle, again in stone. Conisbrough was inherited by William's young son John de Warenne in 1239, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> a minor and the castle was initially managed by his mother, Maud.|$|E
5|$|Friday {{was known}} at Hayes for his {{excessive}} drinking, {{and on one}} occasion the team started a match a player short because Friday had not turned up. When he finally arrived, eighty minutes after kick-off, his intoxication was obvious, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> sent onto the pitch with the match still goalless. The opposition paid him little attention and Friday scored a late winning goal. Hayes were drawn to play Football League Fourth Division club Reading in the FA Cup's second round on 9 December 1972; the team managed to draw 0–0 at Reading and earn {{the right to a}} replay at home, which they lost 1–0 three days later. Although Hayes had lost, the interest of Reading manager Charlie Hurley was piqued. Hurley travelled to Hayes more than once to watch Friday. Having researched the player's background, he was cautious about signing him, but was impressed all the same by his on-field performances.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970 preseason, Sayers {{suffered}} a second knee injury, this time bone bruises {{to his left}} knee. Attempting to play through the injury in the opening game against the Giants, his production was severely limited. He sat out the next two games and returned in Week 4 against the Vikings, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> visibly hampered, most evident when {{he was unable to}} chase down lumbering Vikings defensive lineman Alan Page during a 65-yard fumble return. Sayers carried only six times for nine yards before further injuring his knee. He underwent surgery the following week and was deemed out {{for the remainder of the}} season. He had carried 23 times for 52 yards to that point. During his off time, Sayers took classes to become a stockbroker and became the first black stockbroker in his company's history. He also entered a Paine Webber program for 45 nationwide stockbroker trainees and placed second highest in sales.|$|E
5|$|Stalwarts, led by Grant's old {{political}} ally, Roscoe Conkling, saw the ex-president's renewed popularity {{as a way}} {{for their}} faction to regain power, and sought to find ways to nominate him for the presidency in 1880. Opponents called it a violation of the unofficial two-term rule that had been the norm since George Washington. Grant said nothing publicly, but he wanted the job and encouraged his men. Washburne urged him to run; Grant demurred, saying he would be happy for the Republicans to win with another candidate, though he preferred James G. Blaine to John Sherman. Even so, Conkling and John A. Logan began to organize delegates in Grant's favor. When the convention convened in Chicago in June, there were more delegates pledged to Grant than to any other candidate, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> short of a majority vote to capture the nomination.|$|E
