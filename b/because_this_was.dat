5|$|One {{section of}} the M11 {{extension}} was due to tunnel under George Green in Wanstead. Residents had believed that this would save their green, and a 250-year-old sweet chestnut tree that grew upon it, but <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a cut and cover tunnel, this required the tree to be cut down.|$|E
5|$|The earldom of Suffolk, says {{historian}} Michael Hicks, was 'not particularly well-endowed,' {{probably only}} just scraping the £666 qualifying income for that rank. His mother, though, held substantial estates {{in her own}} right, from her father, Sir Thomas Chaucer. Furthermore, <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> Alice's third marriage, she held large dowers from both previous husbands, the second {{of whom had been}} Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{memoirs of}} Ken Flower, then the {{director}} of Rhodesia's Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), Harper's downfall {{was the result of}} an extramarital affair with a young secretary in the Rhodesian civil service who the CIO discovered was an agent for MI6. Flower informed Smith of this on 3 July and the Prime Minister demanded Harper's resignation that afternoon; Harper acquiesced the next day. <b>Because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> kept secret (presuming it is true), Harper's sudden departure from the Cabinet was interpreted by many observers at the time as the culmination of the personal and political rivalry between Smith and Harper, or the result of disagreements over the new constitution.|$|E

5|$|By 1993, Romney {{had begun}} {{thinking}} about entering politics, partly based upon Ann's urging and partly {{to follow in}} his father's footsteps. He decided to challenge incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, who was seeking re-election for the sixth time. Political pundits viewed Kennedy as vulnerable that year– {{in part because of}} the unpopularity of the Democratic Congress as a whole, and in part <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> Kennedy's first election since the William Kennedy Smith trial in Florida, in which the senator's reputation for character had suffered. Romney changed his affiliation to Republican in October 1993 and formally announced his candidacy in February 1994. In addition to his leave from Bain Capital, Romney also stepped down from his church leadership role in 1994.|$|E
5|$|In the playoffs, the Bulls {{lost only}} {{three games in}} four series (Miami Heat 3–0, New York Knicks 4–1, Orlando Magic 4–0). They {{defeated}} the Seattle SuperSonics 4–2 in the NBA Finals to win their fourth championship. Jordan was named Finals MVP for a record fourth time, surpassing Magic Johnson's three Finals MVP awards. He also achieved only the second sweep of the MVP Awards in the All-Star Game, regular season and NBA Finals, Willis Reed having achieved the first, during the 1969–70 season. <b>Because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> Jordan's first championship since his father's murder, and it was won on Father's Day, Jordan reacted very emotionally upon winning the title, including a memorable scene of him crying on the locker room floor with the game ball.|$|E

Many sculptors and stone-cutters of the period lived at the foot of Mount Etna, making a diversity of objects, including balustrades, pillars, fountains and seats for buildings. Shades of black or grey were used to create contrasting decorative effects, accentuating the Baroque love of light and shade as demonstrated in (illustration 2).|$|E

The spacecraft closest approach to the planet occurred on 25 August 1989. <b>Because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the last major planet the spacecraft could visit, {{it was decided to}} make a close flyby of the moon Triton, regardless of the consequences to the trajectory, similarly to what was done for Voyager 1s encounter with Saturn and its moon Titan. The images relayed back to Earth from Voyager 2 became the basis of a 1989 PBS all-night program, Neptune All Night.|$|E
5|$|The court's {{patronage}} of literature is especially important, <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{the period in}} which the English language took shape as a literary language. There is little evidence to tie Richard directly to {{patronage of}} poetry, but it was nevertheless within his court that this culture was allowed to thrive. The greatest poet of the age, Geoffrey Chaucer, served the king as a diplomat, a customs official and a clerk of The King's Works while producing some of his best-known work. Chaucer was also in the service of John of Gaunt, and wrote The Book of the Duchess as a eulogy to Gaunt's wife Blanche. Chaucer's colleague and friend John Gower wrote his Confessio Amantis on a direct commission from Richard, although he later grew disenchanted with the king.|$|E

25|$|According to Ayesha Jalal, David Gimartin {{believes}} {{that a number of}} pirs developed a personal stake in the League's election campaign; not <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the most appropriate tactical response to the prospect of a British transfer of power but because the pirs saw in the Pakistan movement an opportunity {{to break out of the}} colonial structures that had for so long thwarted their religious interests.|$|E

This was just like the case of Voyager 1's encounters with Saturn and its massive moon Titan.|$|E
