40|$|A two month old male {{presented}} {{with a history of}} <b>bloody,</b> mucous <b>diarrhoea</b> 6 days after the introduction of cow’s milk formula. Cow’s milk protein allergy was suspected and breast feeding with exclusion of all cow’s milk products from his mother’s diet was suggested. As a consequence the symptoms disappeared. One month later, when his mother tried to give him again cow’s milk formula, diarrhoea with severe rectal bleeding reappeared. A limited colonoscopy was performed suggesting allergic colitis. Despite the exclusion of all cow’s milk products from his mother’s diet combined with the use of an aminoacid containing formula, diarrhoea and rectal bleeding were not improved. At that time a diagnosis of perinatal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was made, based on CMV detection in infant’s blood and urine as well as in maternal milk. The symptoms were resolved one week after discontinuation of breast feeding. It is known that CMV can be transmitted from infected mothers to their infants through breastfeeding. However the effect of CMV infected milk in an already fragile mucosa because of the allergic colitis is not well established. Further attention should be given to elucidate a potential interaction between these two conditions...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY In a {{prospective}} one year study, comprising children with acute gastroenteritis admitted to hospital or treated as outpatients, the clinical and laboratory features of rotavirus diarrhoea (168 cases) {{were compared with}} those of enteric adenovirus (32 cases), bacterial (42), mixed (16), and non-specific (135) infections. The rotavirus disease was remarkably consistent, with a sudden onset of vomiting, a high frequency of fever and dehydration, and a mean duration of diarrhoea of 5 - 9 days. Outpatients excreting rotavirus had a similar but milder illness, mainly on account of less pronounced vomiting. The predominant symptom of enteric adenoviruses was long lasting diarrhoea (mean 10 - 8 days). Abdominal pain, <b>bloody</b> stools, prolonged <b>diarrhoea</b> (mean 14 * 1 days), leucocytosis, and a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate strongly suggested a bacterial aetiology. Mixed infections caused longer lasting diarrhoea (mean 8 - 0 days) than rotavirus alone, but the severity of the illness was not increased. The clinical features of infection with unidentified pathogens most resembled those of bacterial infections. Respiratory symptoms were not significantly associated with any particular pathogen.

40|$|Several food pathologies due to new or {{already known}} {{micro-organisms}} occur {{all over the}} world every year. Food concerned are more and more frequently traditional typical, ethnical products coming from fast or slow food systems.

The causes of these epidemics, apart from the concerned pathogen, are linked to the contaminated first matter or to contaminations occurred during food processing and consequently {{due to the lack of}} employment of the most fundamental sanitary measures and to non-control of the critical points of the HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point) systems. The pre-requirements to promote food health consist of the implementation of good agriculture husbandry and production practices, the use of HACCP systems, the training of the workers employed in the different productive rows and in the adoption of identification and traceability systems.

A total of 4214 (62. 7 %) indigenous Nigerian dogs were presented to ABUVTH, Zaria, Nigeria between January, 1978 to December, 2000 with GI parasitism. The sick dogs were presented with the following clinical signs: Anorexia, post pandrial emesis, pale mucous membrane, dog bite, <b>diarrhoea,</b> <b>bloody</b> faeces, recumbency, straining during defaecation, emaciation, ascites, foaming in the mouth, worms in faeces, abortion, fever (39. 8 - 41 ?C), inflamed eyes, lethargy, bloody discharge from the nose, abdominal pain and dullness. About 5469 (81. 4 %) of the dogs presented were males, while 1252 (18. 6 %) were females.

40|$|Travellers' {{diarrhoea}} {{caused by}} enteric protozoa like Entamoeba histolytica {{is among the}} most common protozoan diseases in developing countries. In developing countries, amoebiasis is the second most prevalent protozoan disease. This protozoan parasite is often known to coexist {{as a part of the}} normal gut microbiota. It is estimated that around 50 - 60 % of population in developing countries might be harbouring Entamoeba in an asymptomatic manner. Due to physiological perturbation or upon immuno-compromise, it can become virulent and then cause <b>diarrhoea,</b> <b>bloody</b> stools and may invade other organs if left untreated. Nitroimidazole drugs, namely metronidazole and tinidazole, are widely used to treat protozoan infections. These drugs often show dose-dependent side effects. With emerging antibiotic resistance, novel therapeutics to prevent parasitic infections is required. This study aims to study effect of probiotics on prevention of Amoebiasis. In this study, we have investigated the effect of selected probiotics on the growth of Entamoeba. From the list of probiotics being currently used, five bacterial strains were selected for testing. These probiotic strains were co-cultured with Entamoeba, and their effect on Entamoeba proliferation was checked. Of the five probiotics chosen, individual treatments of Lactobacillus casei and Enterococcus faecium showed a significant reduction of up to 71 % in parasite survival only at higher CFUs. When the two probiotics were used in combination, the percentage of survival reduced gradually further to 80 % at a total CFU of 10 (9) cells/ ml of bacteria. The study lays the foundation for providing cost-effective prophylactic treatment for amoebiasis without the overuse of antibiotics...|$|R
5000|$|The {{plant is}} {{somewhat}} poisonous, its toxicity referable to its containing cucurbitacins,a class of cytotoxic triterpenoids named for their frequent occurrence in genera of the cucumber and gourd family Cucurbitaceae, such as Bryonia.

C. hookerianum {{is used in the}} folk medicine of Chile as an emmenagogue and abortifacient and the leaves and bark are considered to have emetic properties.

50|$|Ipecac or {{ipecacuanha}} {{consists of}} the dried rhizome and roots of Cephaelis ipecacuanha. The medical virtues of ipecac are almost entirely due to the action of its alkaloids-emetine and cephaline. Till today, emetine {{remains one of the}} best drugs for treating amoebic liver abscess. It has a direct action on the trophozoites.Its greater concentration and duration of action in the liver as compared to that in the intestinal wall explains its high efficacy in amoebic liver abscess and also its low parasitic cure rate for intestinal amoebiasis. The drug is detoxicated and eliminated slowly. It may, therefore, produce cumulative effects. In man, emetine poisoning is characterized by muscular tremors, weakness and pain in the extremities which tend to persist until drug administration is stopped. Gastro-intestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting and <b>bloody</b> <b>diarrhoea.</b> The latter may be mistaken for a recurrence of amoebic dysentery.Many clinicians fear the occurrence of cardiac toxicity due to this drug and hence avoid using it. Serious cardiac toxicity, however, is rare. Both recovered with the treatment for heart failure and withdrawal of emetine. One patient who was given fifteen injections of emetine in a dose of 60 mgm per day, died. Overdosage of emetine produces focal necrosis of cardiac muscle resulting in cardiac failure and sudden death.Emetine, like digitalis may produce mild ST and T wave changes in the electrocardiogram which does not necessarily mean serious toxicity. In fact, they are encountered, though less commonly, after the use of chloroquine and metronidazole as well. Toxic effects on the myocardium have been described even in doses generally considered safe. These are rise in pulse rate, fall in systolic blood pressure and ST-T changes in the electrocardiogram.The other rare E.C.G. changes include deformity of QRS complexes, prolongation of PR interval, atrial premature beats, and atrial tachycardia. In adults, fatal cases have been reported with a total dose of 0.6 G. or less. The incidence of toxic heart damage greatly increases in patients with anaemia. In patients having myocardial disease or marked hypertension, emetine can be used for amoebic liver abscess, as the benefits from it may outweigh possible hazards. This situation is unlikely to arise these days, as equally good alternative drugs like metronidazole are available. Patients receiving emetine should be monitored for changes in pulse, blood pressure and electrocardiography. Absolute bed rest during and several days after emetine therapy has been recommended, although we have often seen patients in whom no untoward reactions have occurred in spite of neglecting the above precaution. Theoretically the use of emetine in children is not advised. However, in practice it has been used as discussed elsewhere. It should not be administered during pregnancy unless absolutely necessary.Although emetine is undeniably moderately toxic, the risk of using it would be worth accepting in such a serious illness {{were it not for the}} fact that less toxic drugs like chloroquine and metronidazole are now available. In practice, emetine still produces a more dramatic clinical response thanchloroquine or metronidazole. This point would score in favour of emetine in places where facilities for a proper diagnosis are not available and a therapeutic test remains as the only weapon with a practitioner. Emetine should always be given deep intramuscularly or deep subcutaneously but never intravenously. The total dose in amoebic liver abscess should not exceed 650 mg or 10 mg/kg. This should be given over a period of 10 days in a dose of 6G65 mg. daily. A relapse rate of 7% follows one such course. Therefore, the treatment could be repeated after a period of 2-6 weeks. Of late such a need does not arise, as drug combinations are commonly used. When parenteral emetine is combined with oral chloroquine or two courses of emetine are given, the relapse rate can be brought down to 1 percent.|$|E

We requested the health personnel for an initial diagnosis and case management strategy without providing information about our primary interest in schistosomiasis. The information {{was used to determine}} the chance that a person reporting with symptoms that might have been caused by schistosomiasis would receive praziquantel. All selected health workers participated. Their initial diagnosis was frequently S. haematobium for both scenarios with blood in urine. For the two scenarios with (<b>bloody)</b> <b>diarrhoea,</b> only few mentioned S. mansoni. At health centre level, case management in Mali mainly consisted of direct prescription of medication, whereas in Ghana health workers often referred to a hospital or requested a diagnostic test. The ultimate probability of prescribing praziquantel was relatively high for the scenarios with blood in urine, 60 % in Ghana and 75 % in Mali, but very low for both scenarios with (<b>bloody)</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> (< 20 %). Of those health care facilities that would prescribe praziquantel, 60 % (Ghana) and 80 % (Mali) had it in stock.
