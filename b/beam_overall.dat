40|$|AbstractThe exact {{analysis}} of reinforced concrete deep beams {{is a complex}} problem {{and the presence of}} web openings aggravates the situation. However, no code provision exists for the {{analysis of}} deep beams with web opening. The code implemented strut and tie models are debatable and no unique solution using these models is available. In this study, the finite element method is utilized to study the behavior of reinforced concrete deep beams with and without web openings. Furthermore, the effect of the reinforcement distribution on the <b>beam</b> <b>overall</b> capacity has been studied and compared to the Egyptian code guidelines. The damaged plasticity model has been used for the analysis. Models of simply supported deep beams under 3 and 4 -point bending and continuous deep beams with and without web openings have been analyzed. Model verification has shown good agreement to literature experimental work. Results of the parametric analysis have shown that web openings crossing the expected compression struts should be avoided, and the depth of the opening should not exceed 20 % of the <b>beam</b> <b>overall</b> depth. The reinforcement distribution should be in the range of 0. 1 – 0. 2 beam depth for simply supported deep beams...|$|E

40|$|A two- and {{three-dimensional}} {{finite element}} analysis was carried out to analyze critical buckling loads of debonded sandwich <b>beams.</b> Both <b>overall</b> buckling and wrinkling were analyzed, using sandwich beams having 45 mm and 75 mm core thicknesses.

Specifically, space-charge induced distortions of ultrafast electron diffraction patterns from single crystal specimens and their dependence on electron bunch-charge, beam energy, energy spread, focusing conditions and specimen thickness have been investigated using the General Particle Tracer code. We have found that these space-charge interactions lead to significant broadening and displacement of the Bragg spots at currently realizable electron beam illumination conditions.

40|$|The {{following}} {{project is}} based on the design and the production of a sport trimaran. This choice was driven by the increasing popularity of the multihull in the sailing world brought by the racing event (Route du Rhum, Trophée Jules Verne, Extreme 40, and lately, America’s Cup) and by the author personal interest in the challenge of designing a boat that can combine high performances and sufficient accommodations for a week coastal cruise. The design limitations were selected as follow: can tow behind a car and setup by the crew without external help, should stay in the current market prices. Two versions were to be designed: Fun & Extreme, the Fun was used as a base design to develop this project around.

40|$|An areal {{distribution}} of {{sensors can be}} used for estimating the direction of incoming waves through beamforming. Beamforming may be implemented as a phase-shifting and stacking of data recorded on the different sensors (i. e., conventional beamforming). Alternatively, beamforming can be applied to cross-correlations between the waveforms on the different sensors. We derive a kernel for beamforming cross-correlated data and call it cross-correlation beamforming (CCBF). We point out that CCBF has slightly better resolution and aliasing characteristics than conventional beamforming. When auto-correlations are added to CCBF, the array response functions are the same as for conventional beamforming. We show numerically that CCBF is more resilient to non-coherent noise. Furthermore, we illustrate that with CCBF individual receiver-pairs can be removed to improve mapping to the slowness domain. An additional flexibility of CCBF is that cross-correlations can be time-windowed prior to beamforming, e. g., to remove the directionality of a scattered wavefield. The observations on synthetic data are confirmed with field data from the SPITS array (Svalbard). Both when beamforming an earthquake arrival and when beamforming ambient noise, CCBF focuses more of the energy to a central <b>beam.</b> <b>Overall,</b> the main advantage of CCBF is noise suppression and its flexibility to remove station pairs that deteriorate the signal-related beampower. </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{curved beams}} of {{thin-walled}} construction secondary stresses such as crushing {{of the web}} and curling of the flanges occur due to the initial curvature of the beam. The presence of these stresses becomes more significant when advanced composite materials are used. Two parameters, accounting for material stiffness and geometric effects of the beam structure, characterize the flange stress redistribution. Using a simple `strength of materials'-based analytical solution for flange curling and web crushing, the design and optimization of curved composite I- and box beams under bending were examined. The ply orientations and stacking sequence of the flange {{have been found to}} drastically affect the nature of these stress redistributions and consequently the overall load carrying capability of the <b>beam.</b> <b>Overall</b> frame optimization was explored. To maximize load carrying capability, for a given amount of material, of a curved beam structure under bending in its own plane, the overall bending stiffness should be maximized and flange curling minimized. For composite beams, this is most effectively accomplished by minimizing web thickness and placing a large percentage of flange fibers perpendicular to the web. For the box beam, a low web bending stiffness seems beneficial in reducing flange curling moments. While web crushing needs to be considered, the curling of the flanges and its effect on the web is more critical...|$|E

40|$|A simpler, {{alternative}} to 'prism type' electro-optic (EO) solid state deflectors has been recently demonstrated. This device {{is essentially a}} single interface version of a conventional deflector, but significant deflection is achieved by setting the input beam at grazing incidence to the interface (where, additionally, it can act as an EO switch). The increased deflection seen near TIR is, however, made {{at the expense of}} increased divergence of the output <b>beam.</b> <b>Overall</b> deflection can be a misleading quantity to determine the performance of a deflector as this could always be increased with suitable lenses. A more reliable figure of merit is the number of separate resolvable spots that can be imaged from the deflector output. Here we analyze the achievable resolution for a single interface deflector. It can be seen that with a suitably sized device, significant resolution can be attained from a single interface deflector as shown in Fig. 1. The resolution is shown here as a function of temperature since if the deflector were to be working at visible wavelengths if would necessarily be heated to avoid photo-refractive effects. Additionally heating has a secondary role in increasing resolution due to the intrinsic n term in the EO equation. Although there are still issues to overcome in terms of the output beam quality of a single interface deflector, it does possess one major advantage over the previous, multiple interface deflectors. Due to its simplicity it can be fashioned to function in 2 dimensions (Fig. 2). This would be the first ever report to our knowledge of a 2 D EO solid state beam deflector...|$|E

In order to provide the highest possible neutron production time, ion beam quality is monitored to isolate possible problems or performance-related issues throughout the accelerator and accumulator ring.

There have been ground-based MOS utilizing digital micromirror devices (DMDs) and they have proven to be highly accurate and reliable instruments. This paper summarizes the results of a continuing study to investigate the performance of DMDs under conditions associated with space deployment. This includes the response of DMDs to radiation, to the vibration and mechanical shock loads associated with launch, and the operability of DMD under cryogenic temperatures. The optical contrast ratio and a study of the long-term reflectance of a bare device have also been investigated. The results of the radiation testing demonstrate that DMDs in orbit would experience negligible heavy-ion induced single event upset (SEU) rate burden, we predict SEU rate of 5. 6 micromirrors per 24 hours. Vibration and mechanical shock testing was performed according to the NASA General Environmental Verification Standard (GEVS), no mirrors failed in the devices tested. The results of low temperature testing suggest that DMDs are not affected by the thermal load and operate smoothly at temperatures at least as low as 78 K. The reflectivity of a bare DMD did not measurably change even after being exposed to ambient conditions over a period of 13 months. The measured contrast ratio (on state vs off state of the DMD micromirrors) was greater than 6000 /: 1 when illuminated with an f/ 4 optical <b>beam.</b> <b>Overall,</b> DMDs are extremely robust and promise to provide a reliable alternative to micro shutter arrays (MSA) to be used in space as remotely programmable slit masks for MOS design...|$|E
40|$|A basic {{ballistic}} problem, the perforation of {{thin plate}} targets [1], is analyzed for laser impact by a continuous wave solid state fiber laser {{in order to}} identify the basic process parameters. For this purpose, thin plate targets made of mild steel with thicknesses between 1 mm and 5 mm have been exposed to an intense laser <b>beam.</b> <b>Overall</b> intensity and beam diameter have been varied systematically. As a key performance parameter, the time to perforation as well as a method for its assessment based on rear side infrared video imaging is proposed. The analysis of the infrared video data reveals different stages of the interaction, including heating of the solid sample, transition from the solid to the liquid state, material flow, and finally the perforation of the sample. The observed time scales are in good agreement with computer simulations calculating the energy transfer, heat conduction and phase transitions in the laser impacted metal plates. In addition, an idealized engineering model is presented which allows the prediction of the target response up to the point of melting very well. The experiments clearly indicate that the perforation of the sample occurs with a significant delay after melting of the material in the region of the laser beam. This observation is related to the melted material flow dynamics. Since the laser does not transfer a significant momentum to the sample, the flow dynamics is governed by surface forces and gravitational forces for the static target arrangement used in the experiments. Hence, a three-phase-model for perforation of thin metal plates by laser impact is proposed with Phase I: heating of plate area exposed to laser impact, Phase II: transition from the solid to the liquid state, and Phase III: a melt flow dynamics phase giving rise to perforation...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), designed to assist climate and atmospheric circulation modeling efforts by providing accurate information on tropical precipitation and latent-heat release, will require ground based validation of satellite derived rainfall totals and type classification. A key element in ground validation is the precipitation classification method authored by Steiner and Houze. The method partitions precipitation by type using a radar reflectivity threshold technique. Steiner and Houze report a lack of any significant range dependency, despite the normal problems associated with beam spreading and increasing altitude with range. This study will examine the Steiner and Houze classification method to quantify the effect of range dependent problems in discerning precipitation type. Radar data for this study were collected on January 10 and 18, 1993 during the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere (TOGA) Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE), by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) N 42 RF WP- 3 D Orion aircraft's tail Doppler radar as well as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Doppler radar deployed on board the United States research vessel Vickers. The data were chosen so the PW- 3 D tail radar data set maintained low ranges to precipitation of interest while the MIT radar data set possessed a wide variation of range. Possible error sources such as position error, radar calibration error, and temporal data collection differences, were minimized so that range dependency could be focused on. Range dependent beam spreading influenced precipitation classification over the largest span of ranges, and the greatest portion of the data. Also, beam spreading was found to increase the horizontal extent of precipitation areas in a direction perpendicular to the central axis of the radar <b>beam.</b> <b>Overall,</b> using the Steiner and Houze classification method, 24. 0 % and 21. 6 % of the precipitation with reflectivity greater than 15 dBZ was classified differently by the two radar data sets at the 1. 5 km and 3. 0 km analysis levels respectively.
