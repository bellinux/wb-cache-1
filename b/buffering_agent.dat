25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{may be used}} as a <b>buffering</b> <b>agent,</b> {{combined with}} table salt, when creating a solution for nasal irrigation.|$|E
50|$|Over-liming is {{most likely}} to occur on soil which has low CEC, such as sand which is {{deficient}} in <b>buffering</b> <b>agents</b> such as organic matter and clay.|$|R
50|$|The pH of the body's {{extracellular}} fluids {{is normally}} tightly regulated by <b>buffering</b> <b>agents,</b> the respiratory system, and the renal system, keeping the pH of the arterial blood plasma between 7.36 and 7.42.|$|R
50|$|Properties 1 and 3 are {{independent}} of {{the presence or absence}} of added <b>buffering</b> <b>agents.</b> They are concentration effects and reflect the fact that pH is related to the logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration.|$|R
25|$|Glycine is a {{significant}} component of some solutions used in the SDS-PAGE method of protein analysis. It serves as a <b>buffering</b> <b>agent,</b> maintaining pH and preventing sample damage during electrophoresis. Glycine {{is also used to}} remove protein-labeling antibodies from Western blot membranes to enable the probing of numerous proteins of interest from SDS-PAGE gel. This allows more data to be drawn from the same specimen, increasing the reliability of the data, reducing the amount of sample processing, and number of samples required. This process is known as stripping.|$|E
25|$|While nasal {{irrigation}} can {{be carried}} out using ordinary tap water, this is potentially unsafe and can be uncomfortable because it irritates the mucous membranes. Therefore, an isotonic or hypertonic salt water solution is normally used, i.e. water with enough salt to match the tonicity of the body cells and blood. For the same reason, lukewarm water is preferred over cold water, which in addition to irritating nasal membranes can also exaggerate the gag reflex during irrigation. Use of distilled, sterile or previously boiled and cooled water over ordinary tap water is advised. A small amount of baking soda is sometimes employed as a <b>buffering</b> <b>agent</b> to neutralize the pH of the irrigating solution.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of silicon}} by diatoms is {{believed}} by many researchers {{to be the}} key to their ecological success. In a now classic study, Egge and Aksnes (1992) found that diatom dominance of mesocosm communities was directly related to the availability of silicic acid — when concentrations were greater than 2 µmol m−3, they found that diatoms typically represented more than 70% of the phytoplankton community. Raven (1983) noted that, relative to organic cell walls, silica frustules require less energy to synthesize (approximately 8% of a comparable organic wall), potentially a significant saving on the overall cell energy budget. Other researchers have suggested that the biogenic silica in diatom cell walls acts as an effective pH <b>buffering</b> <b>agent,</b> facilitating the conversion of bicarbonate to dissolved CO2 (which is more readily assimilated). Notwithstanding the possible advantages conferred by silicon, diatoms typically have higher growth rates than other algae of a corresponding size.|$|E
50|$|Other {{ingredients}} {{found in}} emulsion polymerization include chain transfer <b>agents,</b> <b>buffering</b> <b>agents,</b> and inert salts. Preservatives {{are added to}} products sold as liquid dispersions to retard bacterial growth. These are usually added after polymerization, however.|$|R
5000|$|Acidity regulators, or pH control agents, are food {{additives}} added {{to change or}} maintain pH (acidity or basicity). They can be organic or mineral acids, bases, neutralizing <b>agents,</b> or <b>buffering</b> <b>agents.</b> Typical agents include these acids and their sodium salts: sorbic acid, acetic acid, benzoic acid, and propionic acid. Acidity regulators are indicated by their E number, such as E260 (acetic acid), or simply listed as [...] "food acid".|$|R
25|$|The amine group, in aminoallyl-modified nucleotide, is {{reactive}} with dyes {{such as the}} cyanine series, {{or other}} patented dyes. A problem arises when the dyes react with <b>buffering</b> <b>agents</b> which are necessary for the proper storage of the nucleotides. However, a carbonate buffer {{can be used to}} overcome this problem.|$|R
25|$|Another {{important}} {{factor is the}} mobile phase pH since it can change the hydrophobic character of the analyte. For this reason most methods use a <b>buffering</b> <b>agent,</b> such as sodium phosphate, to control the pH. Buffers serve multiple purposes: control of pH, neutralize the charge on the silica surface of the stationary phase and act as ion pairing agents to neutralize analyte charge. Ammonium formate is commonly added in mass spectrometry to improve detection of certain analytes by the formation of analyte-ammonium adducts. A volatile organic acid such as acetic acid, or most commonly formic acid, is often added to the mobile phase if mass spectrometry is {{used to analyze the}} column effluent. Trifluoroacetic acid is used infrequently in mass spectrometry applications due to its persistence in the detector and solvent delivery system, but can be effective in improving retention of analytes such as carboxylic acids in applications utilizing other detectors, as it is a fairly strong organic acid. The effects of acids and buffers vary by application but generally improve chromatographic resolution.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to enteric coating, [...] "buffering" [...] {{is the other}} main method companies have {{used to try to}} mitigate the problem of gastrointestinal bleeding. Buffering agents are intended to work by preventing the aspirin from concentrating in the walls of the stomach, although the benefits of buffered aspirin are disputed. Almost any <b>buffering</b> <b>agent</b> used in antacids can be used; Bufferin, for example, uses magnesium oxide. Other preparations use calcium carbonate.|$|E
2500|$|... pH can {{be raised}} with a commercially {{available}} <b>buffering</b> <b>agent</b> or through calcium-rich substrates. A calibrated calcium reactor can assist in maintaining both pH and alkalinity. Using purified water from a reverse osmosis/deionization (RO/DI) unit can prevent KH and pH fluctuation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Buffering</b> <b>agents</b> in humans, {{functioning}} in acid base homeostasis, are extracellular agents (e.g., bicarbonate, ammonia) {{as well as}} intracellular agents (including proteins and phosphate). A dilute mixture of monosodium phosphate and disodium phosphate {{can be made to}} approach physiological pH and can serve as an agent for phosphate loading or colonic lavage.|$|R

2500|$|Potential allergens, such as iodine, or {{contaminants}} are to {{be avoided}} in the sodium chloride, water, and buffering ingredients. Pre-manufactured dosages of salt water flushing solutions can be purchased, or the user can mix non-iodized 'kosher' salt, {{with or without a}} <b>buffering</b> <b>agent</b> such as sodium bicarbonate or baking soda. (Table salt frequently is iodized.) ...|$|E
2500|$|As the microoganisms anaerobically digest the biomass {{and convert}} {{it into a}} mixture of {{carboxylic}} acids, the pH must be controlled. This {{is done by the}} addition of a <b>buffering</b> <b>agent</b> (e.g., ammonium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate), thus yielding a mixture of carboxylate salts. Methanogenesis, being the natural final stage of anaerobic digestion, is inhibited by the presence of the ammonium ions or by the addition of an inhibitor (e.g., iodoform). [...] The resulting fermentation broth contains the produced carboxylate salts that must be dewatered. This is achieved efficiently by vapor-compression evaporation. Further chemical refining of the dewatered fermentation broth may then take place depending on the final chemical or biofuel product desired.|$|E
2500|$|A daily nasal and sinus {{rinse with}} a salt-water {{solution}} (a mixture of 0.9% non-iodized sodium chloride and either purified or filtered water warmed to around 98 degrees F/ 37 degrees C, {{with or without}} inclusion of a <b>buffering</b> <b>agent</b> such as sodium bicarbonate) has been recommended as both an add-on and primary treatment in such cases and is preferable {{to the use of}} corticosteroids except in the most serious cases of acute bacterial sinusitis. Irrigation should be used with caution in infants; however, saline drops or saline as a mist is well tolerated for infants and children with upper respiratory tract symptoms leading to nasal congestion. Filtered water may also be used with an absolute filtration down to [...]1 micron.|$|E
25|$|Propylene glycol oxidizes {{when exposed}} to air and heat, forming lactic acid. If not {{properly}} inhibited, this fluid can be very corrosive, so pH <b>buffering</b> <b>agents</b> such as dipotassium phosphate and potassium bicarbonate are often added to propylene glycol, to prevent acidic corrosion of metal components. Pre-inhibited propylene glycol solutions {{can also be used}} instead of pure propylene glycol to prevent corrosion.|$|R
50|$|The body's {{acid-base balance}} is tightly regulated. Several <b>buffering</b> <b>agents</b> exist which {{reversibly}} bind hydrogen ions and impede {{any change in}} pH. Extracellular buffers include bicarbonate and ammonia, while proteins and phosphate act as intracellular buffers. The bicarbonate buffering system is especially key, as carbon dioxide (CO2) can be shifted through carbonic acid (H2CO3) to hydrogen ions and bicarbonate (HCO3−) as shown below.|$|R

50|$|CAPS is {{the common}} name for N-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid, a {{chemical}} used as <b>buffering</b> <b>agent</b> in biochemistry.

50|$|By {{combining}} substances with pKa values differing by {{only two}} or less and adjusting the pH, {{a wide range of}} buffers can be obtained. Citric acid is a useful component of a buffer mixture because it has three pKa values, separated by less than two. The buffer range can be extended by adding other <b>buffering</b> <b>agents.</b> The following mixtures (McIlvaine's buffer solutions) have a buffer range of pH 3 to 8.|$|R
40|$|The {{recognition}} {{and management of}} acid–base disorders is a commonplace activity for intensivists. Despite {{the frequency with which}} non-bicarbonate-losing forms of metabolic acidosis such as lactic acidosis occurs in critically ill patients, treatment is controversial. This article describes the properties of several <b>buffering</b> <b>agents</b> and reviews the evidence for their clinical efficacy.

40|$|The use of buffers {{that mimic}} {{biological}} solutions is {{a foundation of}} biochemical and biophysical studies. However, <b>buffering</b> <b>agents</b> have both specific and nonspecific interactions with proteins. Buffer molecules can induce changes in conformational equilibria, dynamic behavior, and catalytic properties merely by their presence in solution. This effect is of concern {{because many of the}} standard experiments used to investigate protein structure and function involve changing solution conditions such as pH and/or temperature. In experiments in which pH is varied, it is common practice to switch <b>buffering</b> <b>agents</b> so that the pH is within the working range of the weak acid and conjugate base. If multiple buffers are used, it is not always possible to decouple buffer induced change from pH or temperature induced change. We have developed a series of mixed biological buffers for protein analysis that can be used across a broad pH range, are compatible with biologically relevant metal ions, and avoid complications that may arise from changing the small molecule composition of buffers when pH is used as an experimental variable...|$|R

50|$|The buffer {{capacity}} of a <b>buffering</b> <b>agent</b> is at a local maximum when pH+ = pKa. It falls to 33% of the maximum value at pH+ = pKa ± 1 and to 10% at pH+ = pKa ± 1.5. For this reason the useful range is approximately pKa ± 1. Buffer capacity {{is proportional to the}} concentration of the <b>buffering</b> <b>agent,</b> CA, so dilute solutions have little {{buffer capacity}}.|$|E

40|$|Two {{organic acids}} were trialled for the {{extraction}} of calcium from steelmaking blast furnace slag {{for the purpose of}} precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) production: succinic and acetic acids. While the leaching performance of succinic acid was superior, carbonation of its leachate did not result in the production of PCC, but rather the precipitation of calcium succinate, and only after the use of pH <b>buffering</b> <b>agents</b> (sodium hydroxide or bicarbonate). In contrast, carbonation of the acetic acid leachate resulted in the production of PCC, also with the aid of <b>buffering</b> <b>agents.</b> This discrepancy highlights the need for a combination of chemical, mineralogical and morphological analytical techniques for the accurate characterization of carbonation precipitates for future publications in this field. Additional effects observed in this study were the low atom-efficiency of the acids for calcium leaching, at ~ 20 – 30 % of the stoichiometric value, the low extraction selectivity but high carbonation selectivity between calcium and magnesium, and the contamination of the formed PCC’s with small amounts of co-leached aluminium and silicon. Further work is warranted on the purification of this PCC synthesis route. status: publishe...|$|R
