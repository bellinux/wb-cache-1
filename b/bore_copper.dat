5000|$|Magdelaine de la Fayette was the 38th abbess, {{holding this}} {{position}} from 1663 to 1688. In the 1660s she commissioned the architect Pierre Corbineau {{to design a}} new building. She oversaw the demolition of the main abbey building, and presided over {{the construction of the}} new Palais Saint-Georges, built by Corbineau and assisted by another architect from Laval, Tugal Caris. The first two stones were laid on 24 March 1670; one by Charles-François de La Vieuville, Bishop of Rennes, and the other by Magdelaine de la Fayette. The stones <b>bore</b> <b>copper</b> plates engraved with declarations in Latin. [...] The first one read: In the name of Jesus the Most High, the most illustrious Lord Charles François de la Vieuville, bishop of Rennes, was present at the inception of this house, and blessed it, and greatly desired true peace for all the spouses of Jesus Christ who were to dwell in it. 24 March 1670. The second stone's copper plate was engraved with the inscription: With the favour of God, the greatest and best, Lady Magdelaine de la Fayette, most celebrated for ancestry and virtues, undertook and initiated with singular zeal the renovation of this house, which was collapsing on account of age, from its foundations into a more splendid form. 24 March 1670.|$|E
50|$|The bullet must tightly fit {{the bore}} {{to seal the}} high {{pressure}} of the burning gunpowder. This tight fit results in a large frictional force. The friction of the bullet in the bore does have a slight impact on the final velocity, but that is generally {{not much of a}} concern. Of greater concern is the heat that is generated due to the friction. At velocities of about 300 m/s, lead begins to melt, and deposit in the bore. This lead build-up constricts the bore, increasing the pressure and decreasing the accuracy of subsequent rounds, and is difficult to scrub out without damaging the bore. Rounds, used at velocities up to 460 m/s, can use wax lubricants on the bullet to reduce lead build-up. At velocities over 460 m/s, nearly all bullets are jacketed in copper, or a similar alloy that is soft enough not to wear on the barrel, but melts at a high enough temperature to reduce build-up in the <b>bore.</b> <b>Copper</b> build-up does begin to occur in rounds that exceed 760 m/s, and a common solution is to impregnate the surface of the bullet with molybdenum disulfide lubricant. This reduces copper build-up in the bore, and results in better long-term accuracy. Large caliber projectiles also employ copper driving bands for rifled barrels for spin-stabilized projectiles; however, fin-stabilized projectiles fired from both rifle and smoothbore barrels, such as the APFSDS anti-armor projectiles, employ nylon obturation rings that are sufficient to seal high pressure propellant gasses and also minimize in-bore friction, providing a small boost to muzzle velocity.|$|E

50|$|The {{surface of}} lead bullets fired at high {{velocity}} may melt due to hot gases behind and friction with the <b>bore.</b> Because <b>copper</b> {{has a higher}} melting point, and greater specific heat capacity and hardness, copper-jacketed bullets allow greater muzzle velocities.|$|R
50|$|A {{dispute between}} herdsmen loyal to Numitor and Amulius {{is at the}} heart of this version. The twins sided with Amulius. Remus was {{captured}} when Romulus was elsewhere. When Faustulus learned that Remus has been taken to Numitor, he went to Alba with the basket in which the infant twins were abandoned. It <b>bore</b> a <b>copper</b> plate with an engraving that had long been effaced. He was stopped by the city guards at the gate. The servant charged with abandoning the twins happened to be present and saw the basket, immediately going to inform the king. When brought before Amulius, Faustulus tries to fool the king by telling him the twins were alive elsewhere and the basket was being brought to their mother Ilia.|$|R
40|$|Particle damping offers {{potential}} for designing a better passive damping technique with a minimal {{impact on the}} strength, stiffness {{and the weight of}} a vibrating structure. Due to its conceptual simplicity, potential effectiveness over a wide frequency range, temperature and degradation insensitivity, and cost-effectiveness, particle damping is an attractive passive damping. This paper investigates the efficiency of particle damping in control of vibrations in a <b>boring</b> bar using <b>copper</b> and lead particles of various sizes. Their damping performances were compared and the results are presented...|$|R
40|$|Two-phase {{flow pattern}} data have been {{obtained}} experimentally for R- 407 C flowing inside 12 mm bore sight glasses, which were located at the outlets of 3 m long, plain <b>bore</b> <b>copper</b> tube heat transfer test sections. The tests covered nominal mass velocities of 100, 200 and 300 kg/m 2 s, vapor qualities from 5 - 95 %, and {{a wide range of}} heat fluxes, all taken at a fixed inlet saturation pressure of 6. 45 bar to the evaporator test section. The flow pattern data were compared to the newly developed two-phase frow pattern map of Kattan, Thome and Favrat (1997) and Kattan (1996). The flow pattern map covers both adiabatic flows and diabatic flows for evaporating refrigerants, including the prediction of the onset of dryout {{at the top of the}} tube in the annular flow regime as a function of heat flux. This flow pattern map, formerly developed from a database for R- 123, R- 134 a, R- 502, R- 402 A and R- 404 A, accurately predicted the new flow pattern data and the onset of dryout of R- 407 C without modification...|$|E
5000|$|Vermont coined a {{currency}} called Vermont coppers from a mint operated by Reuben Harmon in East Rupert (1785-1788), and operated a postal system. While the Vermont <b>coppers</b> <b>bore</b> the legend Vermontis. Res. Publica (Latin for republic or state of Vermont), {{the constitution and}} other official documents used the term [...] "State of Vermont". It referred to its chief executive as a [...] "governor". The 1777 constitution refers to Vermont variously: the third paragraph of the preamble, for example, mentions [...] "the State of Vermont", and in the preamble's last paragraph, the constitution refers to itself as [...] "the Constitution of the Commonwealth".|$|R

It was found that the child's drinking water was obtained from a <b>bore</b> via new <b>copper</b> pipes. The <b>bore</b> water had a pH of 4 · 4 and after passage through copper pipes had a very high copper level of 675 μg/ 100 ml.

40|$|A light-weight, inexpensively fabricated, {{hermetically}} sealable, repairable {{package for}} small electronic or electromechanical units, having multiple connections, is described. A molded ring frame of polyamide-imide plastic (Torlon) is attached along one edge to {{a base plate}} formed of a highly heat conducting material, such as aluminum or <b>copper.</b> <b>Bores</b> are placed through a base plate within {{the area of the}} edge surface of ring frame which result in an attachment of the ring frame to the base plate during molding. Electrical leads are molded into the ring frame. The leads are L-shaped gold-plated copper wires imbedded within widened portions of the side wall of the ring frame. Within the plastic ring frame wall the leads are bent (typically, though not necessarily at 90 deg) so that they project into the interior volume of the ring frame for connection to the solid state devices...|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} {{safety of}} a KBS- 3 type deep repository {{is based on a}} system of passive barriers with multiple safety functions, so that the degradation of one barrier does not substantially impair the overall performance of the disposal system. The repository is planned to be situated at a depth of about 500 m in granitic bedrock. From a tunnel system, deposition holes are <b>bored</b> in which <b>copper</b> canisters with spent nuclear fuel are emplaced and surrounded with bentonite clay. The tunnels will be backfilled. A basic requirement on geologic disposal of high- level radioactive waste is that the long-term safety of the repository should not be dependent on monitoring or maintenance by future generations. The development of the Swedish repository system is based on a strategy of stepwise implementation. The deep repository will be built in two stages. In the first stage, approximately 10 % of the spent nuclear fuel will be emplaced after which the experience gained will be evaluated. Then follows disposal of the remaining spent fuel and closure of the repository. The strategy to start the disposal with a minor par...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{has proven to}} be a valuable methodological approach in both basic research and clinical practice. However, significant hardware advances are still needed in order to further improve and extend the applications of the technique. The present dissertation predominantly addresses gradient and shim coil design (sub-systems of the MR system). A design study to investigate gradient performance over a set of surface geometries ranging in curvature from planar to a full cylinder using the boundary element (BE) method is presented. The results of this study serve as a guide for future planar and pseudo-planar gradient systems for a range of applications. Additions to the BE method of coil design are developed, including the direct control of the magnetic field uniformity produced by the final electromagnet and the minimum separation between adjacent wires in the final design. A method to simulate induced eddy currents on thin conducting surfaces is presented. The method is used to predict the time-dependent decay of eddy currents induced on a cylindrical <b>copper</b> <b>bore</b> within a 7 T MR system and the induced heating on small conducting structures; both predictions are compared against experiment. Next, the method is extended to predict localized power deposition and the spatial distribution of force due to the Lorentz interaction of the eddy current distribution with the main magnetic field. New methods for the design of actively shielded electromagnets are presented and compared with existing techniques for the case of a whole-body transverse gradient coil. The methods are judged using a variety of shielding performance parameters. A novel approach to eliminate the interactions between the MR gradient system and external, non-MR specific, active devices is presented and its feasibility is discussed. A completely new approach to shimming is presented utilizing a network of current pathways that can be adaptively changed on a subject-by-subject basis and dynamically controlled. The potential benefits of the approach are demonstrated using computer simulations and a prototype coil is constructed and tested as a proof-of-principle...|$|R
40|$|A 42 mm <b>bore,</b> 40 W <b>copper</b> vapour laser (CVL) {{has been}} set up in a test rig in order to measure the values of many of the {{parameters}} of the laser as a function of time in the laser pulse-delay cycle, and of radial position in the plasma tube, while at all times running under standard operating conditions. In this way it has been possible to obtain the world's first truly comprehensive parameter map of the CVL in which all of the measurements have been performed upon the same device, operating under identical conditions and with all times accurately referenced to a datum. It is intended that this set of data is primarily for the benefit of those involved in the computer modelling of the CVL plasma, however initial analysis of the results obtained has been undertaken. All diagnostic techniques have been carefully selected as offering the highest possible level of accuracy and freedom from assumptions, and each one employed has been described in detail in terms of both theory and practical application. The hook method has been used for the measurement of the population density in the copper ground state, the upper and lower laser levels, one of the copper quartet levels, and one of the neon metastable levels, each with a time resolution of 5 ns, and a radial resolution of 2 mm. The electron density has been measured, also with a radial resolution of 2 mm and with nanosecond time resolution using a two colour interferometric technique employing the measurement of the refractive index of the plasma at 10. 6 Î¼m and 670 nm. Measurement has been made of the voltage on the laser electrodes and the current flowing in the laser during the discharge. Ancillary experiments have been performed to study the CVL discharge which have yielded some unexpected results, and measurements have been performed on a 60 mm bore CVL to determine fully the mechanism of the time delay between the onset of lasing at the plasma tube wall and on axis, and novel observations have been made. </p...|$|R
