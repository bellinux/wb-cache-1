40|$|Bunch {{compactness}} is a {{key factor}} on the determination of grape quality. The use of qualitative visual systems for its determination is quite controversial, hindering some studies that require objective and quantitative measures of the trait. Here, eleven indexes published in literature and eight designed in this survey were tested with three different criteria to determine their usefulness for the estimation <b>of</b> <b>bunch</b> compactness. A sample <b>of</b> 110 grape <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> morphology, from 11 different varieties, were classified {{by a panel of}} 14 judges according to the visual OIV descriptor No 204. Besides, a number of measures were taken from the same bunches, which were used for the indexes' calculations. Several indexes designed here proved to be more suitable to obtain quantitative estimations for this trait in a genetically diverse set of varieties than the indexes previously published. Two of the selected indexes, CI- 18 and CI- 19, are based on the combination of six metrics from bunches (<b>bunch</b> weight, number <b>of</b> berries per <b>bunch,</b> number <b>of</b> seeds per berry, bunch length, first ramification length and either pedicel length or number <b>of</b> ramifications per <b>bunch,</b> respectively). These two indexes are more suitable for inter-varietal studies where obtaining quantitative data is critical.

The sources of identification are the position, shape, and allowance of free minutes that defines each tariff offered by monopolists as well as a measure of market penetration in each cellular market during the first and last quarter of monopoly regime.
