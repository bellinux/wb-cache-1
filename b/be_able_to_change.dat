They are associated with fertility rites.|$|E

A user interface that has been extensively customized by one person may appear completely unfamiliar to another who knows the software under a different appearance. Some usability practitioners feel that this flexibility requires interaction design expertise that users might not have.|$|E
25|$|Although melanin {{is found}} in the skin of many species, in the reptiles, the amphibians, and fish, the {{epidermis}} is often relatively colourless. Instead, the colour of the skin is largely due to chromatophores in the dermis, which, in addition to melanin, may contain guanine or carotenoid pigments. Many species, such as chameleons and flounders may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the colour of their skin by adjusting the relative size of their chromatophores.|$|E

25|$|Since at {{a minimum}} the {{starting}} code address vector must always be valid on reset, systems commonly included some nonvolatile memory (e.g. ROM) starting at address zero to contain the vectors and bootstrap code. However, for a general purpose system it is desirable for the operating system to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the vectors at runtime. This was often accomplished by either pointing the vectors in ROM to a jump table in RAM, or through use of bank switching to allow the ROM {{to be replaced by}} RAM at runtime.|$|E

However, Ofcom believes that in the short to medium term, it is unlikely existing free-to-air channels will convert to pay TV. This is because, firstly, Multiplex B {{is run by the}} BBC, which is not expected to request the removal of the free-to-air requirement. Secondly, {{due to the nature of}} the contracts the channel broadcasters hold with multiplex operators and content providers, it is unlikely a channel will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> to pay TV.|$|E
25|$|The book The Dance of Change states {{there are}} many reasons why an {{organization}} may have trouble in transforming itself into a learning organization. The first is that an organization does not have enough time. Employees and management may have other issues that take priority over trying to change the culture of their organization. The team {{may not be able to}} commit the time if an institution does not have the appropriate help or training. For an organization to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> it needs to know the steps necessary to solve the problems it faces. As a solution, a mentor or coach who is well versed in the learning organization concept may be necessary.|$|E

Only women have ever survived the agony, but through their {{breeding}} program the Bene Gesserit seek the male Kwisatz Haderach who will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> an illuminating poison. The Bene Gesserit try over many generations through selective breeding to produce such a being. A Kwisatz Haderach is given abilities {{different from those}} of a Reverend Mother. During the spice agony, there are two areas of the soul that the acolyte may visit — the part that gives, and the part that takes; a Reverend Mother cannot access the memories of her male ancestors, and is terrified by the psychic space within her that the masculine memories inhabit. Until Paul Atreides, all men who had attempted the spice agony had died.|$|E

He also depicted Northcott's trial as taking place in Los Angeles, though it was held in Riverside. The title is derived from Western European folklore and refers to a creature—a [...] "changeling"—left by fairies {{in place of a}} human child. Due to the word's association with the supernatural, Straczynski [...] intended it only as a temporary title, believing he would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> it later on.|$|E

500|$|Yuri on Ice has {{highlighted}} homophobia {{in figure}} skating and other areas; the seventh episode features a flashback {{in which a}} younger Victor performs in a costume based on those worn by openly-gay figure skater Johnny Weir, who was subject to homophobic comments throughout his career. Weir {{said in an interview}} with The Geekiary, [...] "I think all positive imagery of LGBT themes in sport are good. Unfortunately, the majority of people that rule the skating world are conservative and more business minded. I think many of them, while they may love and appreciate the art and the sport, are more interested in the business side of things or power trips. I don't know if Yuri on Ice will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the perception of gay athletes to a 60 year old businessman, but I am of the school of thought that every little bit helps". The series finale features a scene in which Yuri K. and Victor skate together at an exhibition event; something which has not yet occurred in actual competition. Critics have noted that the series depicts two characters from countries with problems concerning LGBT rights.|$|E
