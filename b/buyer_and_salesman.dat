40|$|This paper aims at {{exploring}} and discuss ukhuwwah (unity) value in Islam to formulate Islamic pricing based on ukhuwwah value. The second {{aim is to}} attain a mashlahah. The analytical method employed in this paper is a critical-intuitive thinking based on Islamic epistemological framework, that is the epistemology of bayani, burhani and irfani. The bayani epistemology is a textual presentation from text, event or phenomenon while the burhani epistemology is based on logic to understand events and phenomena or to interpret the text contextually. While irfani epistemology places greater reliance on intuition to achieve scientific knowledge. The three methods are applied integratedly in this paper. Pricing concept based on ukhuwwah value with bayani method is adjusted cost-plus pricing. While based on burhani method is adjusted market mechanism. And pricing concept based on irfani method is flexible price. In generally, pricing concept based on unity value is adjusted price. This pricing concept is harmonization relationship orientation between <b>salesman</b> <b>and</b> <b>buyers,</b> <b>salesman</b> <b>and</b> others salaesmen, <b>and</b> between <b>salesman</b> <b>and</b> this environmen...|$|R

40|$|THESIS 8746 This thesis {{provides}} an empirical investigation of how <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> supplier teams {{make sense of}} collaboration. Specifically, this thesis explores how <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> supplier parties interpret collaboration and how their interpretations of collaboration evolve over time. In addition, it considers the actions that accompany <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> supplier parties? interpretations of collaboration and how these actions link to interpretations. Taking a sensemaking making perspective, this thesis considers collaboration as an interpretative process. The forces which mediate the interpretations of collaboration in this <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> supplier context are also explored. Consistent with the interpretivist approach underpinning this thesis, a process approach is adopted, using a qualitative multiple case study design. A comparative cross-case analysis of four <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> four supplier teams is undertaken to address the research questions in this study...|$|R

50|$|A double auction can be {{analyzed}} as a game. Players are <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> sellers. Their strategies are bids for <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> ask prices for sellers (that depend on the valuations of <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> sellers). Payoffs depend {{on the price of}} the transaction (determined by the auctioneer) and the valuation of a player. The interesting problem is to find a Nash equilibrium - a situation in which no trader has an incentive to unilaterally change their bid/ask price.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We study why {{different}} {{markets are}} cleared by {{different types of}} prices– a universal price for all <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> sellers in some markets, seller-specific prices that are uniform across <b>buyers</b> in others, <b>and</b> personalized prices tailored to both the <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> the seller in yet others. We link these prices to differences in the ownership of the default shares–the shares of the surplus owned by the <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> seller {{in the absence of}} transfers–created by the buyer-seller match. The results point to a theory of designing markets to allow effective pricing...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new model}} of exchange: networks, rather than markets, of <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> sellers. It begins with the empirically motivated premise that a <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> seller must have a relationship, a "link," to exchange goods. Networks - <b>buyers,</b> sellers, <b>and</b> the pattern of links connecting them - are common exchange environments. This paper develops a methodology to study network structures and explains why agents may form networks. In a model that captures characteristics of a variety of industries, the paper shows that <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> sellers, acting strategically in their own self-interests, can form the network structures that maximize overall welfare...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{continuum}} {{model for the}} description of <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> seller dynamics in an Internet market. The relevant variables are the research effort of <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> the sellers' reputation building process. We show that, if a commercial web-site gives consumers the possibility to rate credibly sellers they bargained with, vendors are forced to be more honest. This leads to mutual beneficial symbiosis between <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> sellers; the overall enhanced volume of transactions contributes ultimately to the web-site, which facilitates the matchmaking service. ...|$|R
40|$|The role of <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> {{suppliers}} {{has received}} little {{attention in the}} literature on research and development (R&D) spillovers and productivity, which has focused primarily on the moderating roles of technological and geographic proximity. In this study, we examine R&D spillovers that result from <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> supplier relationships at the transaction level, utilizing a unique dataset identifying individual <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> suppliers of Japanese manufacturing firms, matched with data from R&D surveys and the Census of Manufactures. In an analysis of more than 20, 000 Japanese manufacturing plants, we find that R&D stocks of <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> suppliers provide a substantial productivity performance premium over and above the effect of technologically and geographically proximate R&D stocks. These effects are magnified if the supplier <b>and</b> <b>buyer</b> have business group ties based on capital ownership relationships. While the effects of technologically proximate R&D decay with distance, {{this is not the case}} for spillovers from <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> suppliers. Our results identify transaction-based spillovers as a key influence on productivity and social returns to R&D. nrpages: 28 status: publishe...|$|R

Using administrative data from the Netherlands (2006 – 2010) that combine transaction data, house characteristics, and household characteristics of both <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> sellers, the estimates indicate that a better financial position leads to higher prices for <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> lower prices for sellers. It provides evidence that income and wealth influence housing market behavior of <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> sellers. The results are consistent with theories that suggests that higher income and wealth lead to higher search and bargaining costs, implying that households with better financial positions invest less time and effort in search and bargaining leading to worse bargaining outcomes...|$|R
