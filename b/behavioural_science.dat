5|$|A notable recent {{development}} in Philosophy of Psychology is Functional Contextualism or Contextual <b>Behavioural</b> <b>Science</b> (CBS). Functional Contextualism {{is a modern}} philosophy of science rooted in philosophical pragmatism and contextualism. It is most actively developed in behavioral science in general, the field of behavior analysis, and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science). Functional contextualism serves {{as the basis of}} a theory of language known as relational frame theory and its most prominent application, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of B.F. Skinner's radical behaviorism first delineated by Steven C. Hayes which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.|$|E

25|$|Nudge theory (or nudge) is {{a concept}} in <b>behavioural</b> <b>science,</b> {{political}} theory and economics which argues that positive reinforcement and indirect suggestions to try to achieve non-forced compliance can influence the motives, incentives and decision making of groups and individuals, at least as effectively – if not more effectively – than direct instruction, legislation, or enforcement.|$|E

40|$|This {{commentary}} {{argues that}} social marketing {{and the application}} of <b>behavioural</b> <b>sciences</b> to policy constitute two converging paths towards better policies. It highlights points of convergence and divergence between both disciplines and the potential benefits of further embedding social marketing principles and methods within the recent trend of applying <b>behavioural</b> <b>sciences</b> to policy. Design/methodology/approach – The commentary relies on a review of the <b>behavioural</b> <b>sciences</b> and social marketing literatures and on an analysis of institutional reports reviewing cases of behaviourally informed policies. Findings – <b>Behavioural</b> <b>sciences</b> are increasingly informing policies to promote societal well-being. Social marketing has seldom been explicitly considered as being part of this phenomenon, although it is de facto. Both disciplines share similar end-goals, inform similar policy applications and are rooted in behavioural analysis. They diverge in their theoretical frameworks, their relative emphasis on behaviour change and the span of interventions they generate. Several benefits of embedding social marketing principles and methods within the current way of applying <b>behavioural</b> <b>sciences</b> to policy are identified. Practical implications – Scholars applying <b>behavioural</b> <b>sciences</b> to policy are encouraged, when appropriate, to use the insights and methods from social marketing. Social marketing can engage in a dialogue with <b>behavioural</b> <b>sciences</b> to explore how to pilot the convergence of both approaches in practice. Originality/value – The novelty of this contribution lies in providing the first comparison of the application of <b>behavioural</b> <b>sciences</b> to policy with social marketing, and in using the policy-making cycle framework to map the contributions and complementarities of both disciplines.

25|$|David Spiegelhalter of Cambridge University {{explained}} that the psychological effects of the media coverage include increased feelings of risk and vulnerability. Others have warned of harmful psychological consequences of such coverage. Researchers from King’s College London’s Institute of Psychiatry and the <b>Behavioural</b> <b>Science</b> team at the Health Protection Agency (HPA) found {{that a third of}} people experienced high levels of anger, anxiety, and distress. The German media in particular, has been accused of scaremongering and misleading the public on the safety of nuclear power.|$|E
25|$|Students {{enrolled}} {{in one of}} the undergraduate programs of the Faculty of Social Sciences can earn a degree with a certification through one of the collaborative programs with local colleges. There are 11 Collaborative programs in which social science majors can choose from; <b>Behavioural</b> <b>Science,</b> Child and Youth Workers, Contemporary Labour Studies, Emergency Management, Film Studies, Geomatics, Journalism, Paralegal, Policing and Criminal Justice, Public Relations and Yukon College. Applications must be submitted after completion of their first year of study maintaining a 70% average. Students spend their first, second and fourth year at Brock while their third is spent at the preferred local college. For example, Media and Communication students can enrol in their third year of study in the Public Relations collaborative program with Mohawk College. This allows students to end their undergraduate with a certification of Public Relations and a Bachelor of Arts in four years rather than five if done consecutively. Students who complete this program tend to go into the government sector, private agencies, corporations and/or non-profit.|$|E
