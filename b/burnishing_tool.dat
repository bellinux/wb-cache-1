40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the roll {{burnisher}} {{to be realized}} on the machines of the general technological purpose. The work is aimed at creating the methodical grounds for designing the roll <b>burnishing</b> <b>tools</b> to be used on the machines of the general technological purpose, {{for the formation of}} the relief {{in the form of the}} spherical depressions on the pipes external surfaces, realizing the heat-physical effects. Used have been the kinematic theory of the shape-formation of mating surfaces and designing the tools, the positions of the tribology, the mathematical theory of the experiment planning. The theoretical results: establishing the internal functional connections between the geometry and kinematics of the shape-formation of the spherical depressions relief in the machine-tool pair: the tool - the part provided the frigid kinematic connection between its elements is absent for the control of the accuracy and the thickness of the relief on its base.

50|$|Industrial uses of agate exploit its hardness, {{ability to}} retain a highly {{polished}} surface finish and resistance to chemical attack. It has traditionally been used to make knife-edge bearings for laboratory balances and precision pendulums, and sometimes to make mortars and pestles to crush and mix chemicals. It has also been used for centuries for leather <b>burnishing</b> <b>tools.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ball <b>burnishing</b> <b>tools</b> {{of another}} type are {{sometimes}} used in CNC milling centres {{to follow a}} ball-nosed milling operation: the hardened ball is applied along a zig-zag toolpath in a holder similar to a ball-point pen, except that the 'ink' is pressurised, recycled lubricant. This combines the productivity of a machined finish {{which is achieved by}} a 'semi-finishing' cut, with a better finish than obtainable with slow and time-consuming finish cuts. The feedrate for burnishing is that associated with 'rapid traverse' rather than finish machining.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} forms of {{burnishing}} processes, {{the most common}} are roller burnishing and ball burnishing (a subset of which is {{also referred to as}} ballizing). In both cases, a <b>burnishing</b> <b>tool</b> runs against the workpiece and plastically deforms its surface. In some instances of the latter case (and always in ballizing), it rubs, in the former it generally rotates and rolls. The workpiece may be at ambient temperature, or heated to reduce the forces and wear on the tool. The tool is usually hardened and coated with special materials to increase its life.|$|E
50|$|Burnish setting, also {{sometimes}} referred to as flush setting, shot setting, or gypsy setting (The term gypsy setting is used less often today because the word gypsy is seen as derogatory) is similar to bead setting, but after the stone is inserted into the space, instead of using a graver to lift beads, a <b>burnishing</b> <b>tool</b> is used to push the metal all around the stone. The stone will be roughly flush with the surface, with a burnished or rubbed edge around it. This type of setting has a long history but is gaining a resurgence in contemporary jewelry. Sometimes the metal is finished using sandblasting, as it shows off the work very well.|$|E
50|$|The Snettisham Jeweller's Hoard is a {{collection}} of Romano-British jewellery and raw materials, found during the construction of a house in the Norfolk village of Snettisham in 1985. The hoard is thought to be the working stock of a jeweller, buried in a single clay pot in around AD 155. The finds include the working tip of a quartz <b>burnishing</b> <b>tool</b> (its handle has not survived), partially or fully completed items of jewellery, and raw materials: mainly silver coins, scrap silver items and silver ingots, but also six pieces of scrap gold, and many engraved gemstones to be set in rings. The presence of scrap gold and silver and absence of base metals indicates that the jeweller dealt mainly with high-status customers.|$|E
50|$|Large wooden spoons {{are also}} used as <b>burnishing</b> <b>tools</b> in printmaking, glass jars with a smooth {{circular}} base {{can also be used}} for some applications. Some new world barens are similar in shape to the traditional one with small metal ball bearings embedded in the bottom surface that generate the high point contact pressures (supplied by the braided cord) and have the low friction (offered by the bamboo leaf covering) of a traditional brayer. Another interesting baren is one developed by Professor Seishi Ozakus and made from a bundle of bamboo toothpicks.|$|R
5000|$|G-code is a {{language}} in which people tell computerized machine tools how to make something. The [...] "how" [...] is defined by g-code instructions provided to a machine controller (industrial computer) that tells the motors where to move, how fast to move, and what path to follow. The most common situation is that, within a machine tool, a cutting tool is moved according to these instructions through a toolpath and cuts away material to leave only the finished workpiece. The same concept also extends to noncutting tools such as forming or <b>burnishing</b> <b>tools,</b> photoplotting, additive methods such as 3D printing, and measuring instruments.|$|R
50|$|Unlike LPB, {{traditional}} <b>burnishing</b> <b>tools</b> {{consist of}} a hard wheel or fixed lubricated ball pressed into the surface of an asymmetrical work piece with sufficient force to deform the surface layers, usually in a lathe. The process does multiple passes over the work pieces, usually under increasing load, to improve surface finish and deliberately cold work the surface. Roller and ball burnishing have been studied in Russia and Japan, and were applied most extensively in the USSR in the 1970s. Various burnishing methods are used, particularly in Eastern Europe, to improve fatigue life. Improvements in HCF, corrosion fatigue and SCC are documented, with fatigue strength enhancement attributed to improved finish, {{the development of a}} compressive surface layer, and the increased yield strength of the cold worked surface.|$|R
5000|$|Dzi bead (Tib. གཟི།; {{pronounced}} [...] "zee"; alternative spelling: gzi) {{is a type}} {{of stone}} bead of uncertain origin worn as part of a necklace and sometimes as a bracelet. In several Asian cultures, including that of Tibet, the bead is considered to provide positive spiritual benefit. These beads are generally prized as protective amulets and are sometimes ground into a powder to be used in traditional Tibetan medicine. Beads subject to this process have small [...] "dig marks" [...] where a portion of the bead has been scraped or ground away {{to be included in the}} medicine. Some dzi exhibit grinding and polishing of one or both ends, again the result of reduction for use in traditional Tibetan medicine or, in some cases, due to the bead's use as a <b>burnishing</b> <b>tool</b> in the application of gold leaf to thanka paintings or gilt bronze statuary.|$|E
50|$|Roller {{burnishing}} is {{a method}} of cold working metal surfaces to induce compressive residual stresses and enhance surface roughness qualities. The tooling typically consists of a hardened sphere or cylindrical roller. These tools are pressed onto/across the part being processed. The part (or the tool in some applications) must be moving at a constant rate of speed, for example {{in the case of}} roller burnishing a part on a lathe, the part is spinning and the <b>burnishing</b> <b>tool</b> is moved across the surface as a constant rate; therefore, producing a very consistent finish across the part. Another application is thrust bearing surfaces of some production crankshafts. A dual roller (cylindrical) tool is moved into the thrust bearing journal of a crankshaft, while the crankshaft is spinning the tool is indexed (so each roller is perpendicular to the thrust surface while backing each other up) deforming the surfaces. So the diameters of each roller added together (compensated for elastic deformation) equals the finish dimension of the thrust bearing.|$|E
5000|$|This {{became the}} most common method. The whole surface (usually) of a metal, usually copper, plate is {{roughened}} evenly, manually with a rocker, or mechanically. If the plate were printed {{at this point it}} would show as solid black. The image is then created by selectively burnishing areas of the surface of the metal plate with metal tools; the smoothed parts will print lighter than those areas not smoothed by the <b>burnishing</b> <b>tool.</b> A burnisher has a smooth, round end, which flattens the minutely protruding points comprising the roughened surface of the metal printing plate. Areas smoothed completely flat will not hold ink at all; such areas will print [...] "white," [...] that is, without ink. By varying the degree of smoothing, mid-tones between black and white can be created, hence the name mezzo-tinto which is Italian for [...] "half-tone" [...] or [...] "half-painted". This is called working from [...] "dark to light", or the [...] "subtractive" [...] method.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is {{investigation}} of fine machining efficiency of 34 CrMo 4 steel with roller <b>burnishing</b> <b>tools.</b> Application of roller burnishing process as a clean and environmentally friendly machining process which can replace other pollution processes is of great interests. It is important to evaluate the influence of material properties (primary hardness) for smoothing efficiency and achieving of lower roughness and higher work piece hardness. Design/methodology/approach: Experimental tests of cutting outputs have been done on specimens prepared for final machining process to estimate the rate of roughness decrease, and diameter increase. Roughness measured data before and after roller burnishing process have been compared. Findings: It was found that surface roughness is significantly lower after roller burnishing. Roughness ratio (before/after process) and decrease factor was 4 what doesn’t satisfy expected results. Some roughness results after burnishing exceed upper limits. Research limitations/implications: Results and findings presented in this paper are qualitative and might be slightly different in other machining condition (e. g. higher hardness materials and higher roughness of row material). Practical implications: Smoothing process can be performed on standard machine tools without additional reconfiguration tasks. Process is very rapid. Process is very versatile for any workshop and can be conducted without coolant what is additional advantages for the environment and pollution free machining. Originality/value: Originality of the paper is in analysis of results and smoothing efficiency with Wilcoxon test...|$|R

2500|$|Gravers come in {{a variety}} of shapes and sizes that yield {{different}} line types. The burin produces a unique and recognizable quality of line that is characterized by its steady, deliberate appearance and clean edges. The angle tint tool has a slightly curved tip that is commonly used in printmaking. Florentine liners are flat-bottomed tools with multiple lines incised into them, used to do fill work on larger areas or to create uniform shade lines that are fast to execute. Ring gravers are made with particular shapes that are used by jewelry engravers in order to cut inscriptions inside rings. Flat gravers are used for fill work on letters, as well as [...] "wriggle" [...] cuts on most musical instrument engraving work, remove background, or create bright cuts. Knife gravers are for line engraving and very deep cuts. Round gravers, and flat gravers with a radius, are commonly used on silver to create bright cuts (also called bright-cut engraving), as well as other hard-to-cut metals such as nickel and steel. Square or V-point gravers are typically square or elongated diamond-shaped and used for cutting straight lines. V-point can be anywhere from 60 to 130 degrees, depending on purpose and effect. These gravers have very small cutting points. Other tools such as mezzotint rockers, roulets and burnishers are used for texturing effects. <b>Burnishing</b> <b>tools</b> can also be used for certain stone setting techniques.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Basic {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} studied tool composites and microstructure of diamond- titanium diboride composite, and diamond-titanium diboride-titanium nitride composite with participation of nanopowders have been presented. Design/methodology/approach: Composites were prepared on the basis diamond powders of 3 - 6 µm (MDA 36, Element Six) and the TiB 2 /TiN nanopowders of below 45 nm (Neomat Co. Lithuania firm) and nanopowder of TiB 2 with size of crystallite below of 100 nm (American Elements firm). Different amount of a bonding phase changing in range from 10 to 30 wt% was used. Compacts {{in the shape of}} disc with dimension Ø 15 x 5 mm were sintered at pressure 8. 0 ± 0. 2 GPa and temperature of 2235 K using the Bridgman type apparatus. Microstructure studies using scanning microscope, X-ray and electron diffraction phase analysis were used. Findings: The influence of the bonding phase amount on the tested properties was observed. Vicker’s hardness HV 1 was changed in the range from 20. 0 to 50. 0 GPa, Young’s modulus (E) from 360 to 600 GPa and density (ρ) from 3. 30 to 3. 63 g/cm 3. The highest values of Vickers hardness and Young’s modulus were obtained for diamond composites sintered with 10 wt% TiB 2 of bonding phase. Practical implications: : In this work the effect of reduction powder size from submicron scale to nano scale of two ceramic bonding phases: titanium diboride and titanium diboride-nitride in diamond composites on selected {{mechanical properties}} has been reported.

40|$|Applied Nano Surfaces has from {{laboratory}} studies {{developed a new}} finishing process, called triboconditioning, which combines a mechanical burnishing with coating the surface with tungsten disulfide. At present they are beginning the work to integrate the process into OEMs, for example Scania and Volvo Cars, production lines. As a step in this direction {{the idea of being}} able to monitor and evaluate the results of the triboconditioning process live as components are going through the process was proposed as an investigation area. This would ease the identification and discard of faulty components in a finished batch compared to spot testing. Also such a system could, in the best case, potentially observe early warning signals as to when the process results is starting to decline. A screening of monitoring methods similar to the, from the start, proposed Acoustic Emission has been performed. This resulted in the selection to use an Acoustic Emission system to perform monitoring tests of the process. Such a system was provided from SKF Condition Monitoring Center, together with access to the SKF condition monitoring software. To eliminate potential time related issues and dependencies it was decided to perform the monitoring on test series of the triboconditioning process in the laboratory at ANS, and to repeat previous test series with earlier investigated process results. To test runnability issues the <b>burnishing</b> <b>tools</b> were induced to wear and then used to perform treatments with set standard parameters. The main correlation that could be drawn from the AE signal behaviour to the process results was that it clearly showed the point where the treatment was finished, and no more improvements of friction or surface composition could be expected by letting the process time continue. Signal behaviour indicating tool wear which had affected the process results was distinguishable, however no early signal behaviour correlating to the start of tool wear before it affects the process results were found.
