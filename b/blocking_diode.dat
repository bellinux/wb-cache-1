50|$|If {{the switch}} is cycled fast enough, the {{inductor}} will not discharge fully in between charging stages, and the load will always see a voltage {{greater than that}} of the input source alone when the switch is opened. Also while the switch is opened, the capacitor in parallel with the load is charged to this combined voltage. When the switch is then closed and the right hand side is shorted out from the left hand side, the capacitor is therefore able to provide the voltage and energy to the load. During this time, the <b>blocking</b> <b>diode</b> prevents the capacitor from discharging through the switch. The switch must of course be opened again fast enough to prevent the capacitor from discharging too much.|$|E

From the initial state in which nothing is charged and the switch is open, the current through the inductor is zero. When the switch is first closed, the <b>blocking</b> <b>diode</b> prevents current from flowing into the right hand side of the circuit, so it must all flow through the inductor. However, since the inductor doesn't like rapid current change, it will initially keep the current low by dropping most of the voltage provided by the source.

It {{is based on}} the detailed non-linear model (including series and parallel resistors) of all PV modules composing the PV field.

40|$|Abstract: Two {{circuits}} are described. The first uses external MOSFETs {{driven by}} the Power OK (POK) output of a Li-cell charger IC (MAX 8814), to switch a load between battery and charging source without intervention from a microcontroller or system software. For charger ICs without a POK output (such as the MAX 1507), the second circuit does the same switching using MOSFETs and a comparator (MAX 920). A similar {{version of this article}} appeared in the July 19, 2010 issue of Electronic Design magazine. Most rechargeable battery-powered systems include a switch that connects the load either to the battery or to a source of charging power. Without it, a system with depleted battery may not operate immediately when plugged in. A switching circuit also allows the system to operate on adapter power while the battery is charging. The simplest and lowest-cost method for this battery/adapter power handoff is a diode-OR connection. The load connects to each power source (battery and adapter) through separate Schottky diodes, so power is applied by the higher voltage—battery or adapter. The drawback to this approach is the power loss (P D = I BATTERYV DIODE) and voltage drop (V DIODE = 0. 350 V at 0. 5 A, from the PMEG 2010 AEH data sheet) incurred when the battery services the load. Such losses may not be significant for high-voltage multicell batteries, but for 1 -cell Li+ batteries or 2 – 4 cell NiMh batteries, the percentages of power loss and diode drop across the <b>blocking</b> <b>diode</b> are considerable.

40|$|Technology replaces newer {{technology}} with improved efficiency. Solar technology {{is going to}} draw out a new life to make a green change {{in the terms of}} energy. As a result energy from the sunlight is being changed into electric energy by using solar cell. But still its efficiency could not {{be able to make a}} sense as a depending energy technology. In order to look up the solution, solar technology is changing rapidly to get maximum output. To take up this new challenge solar technology is trying to change its building component that are used to make solar cell, for example solar cell material, bypass diode system, <b>blocking</b> <b>diode</b> system etc.   Now-a-days, solar energy system is designed as a hybrid system that can make electricity and hot water at the same time. In the hybrid solar system, photovoltaic and solar thermal systems are integrated at the same system and as a result heat and electricity are produced simultaneously at the same area. Solar cells are attached with both top and the bottom side of the module and the collectors are set up inside the module. By using collector inside the module, rejected heat from the solar cell is absorbed by the water that flows through the collectors. But a problem arises at the midday or after midday because the reflector of this system cannot reflect sunlight properly on the bottom side of the module. That’s why shading is occurred on the bottom side which reduce the total electrical output of this system.   To work out this shading problem, a bypass diode is connected in parallel with the group of solar cells. Schottky diodes are being used as bypass diodes inside in the most of the solar cells. Schottky diode forward voltage drop is almost 0. 45 Volt which is an important cause of reducing the output power as well as the efficiency of this hybrid system. To solve this problem, new lossless diode is attached inside the hybrid solar system instead of schottky diode which can work with a very low forward voltage drop roughly 50 mV at 10 amp.   To make a comparison between the performance of PVT system with the schottky diode and the new lossless diode, many data has been collected from the outdoor test. After getting the output result, it is clear that the output power and efficiency is going to be changed for using the new lossless diode. For using the lossless diode, the efficiency of the bottom side of the module was increased by 0. 31 %. ...|$|E

40|$|Solar {{photovoltaic}} power generating {{system is}} an alternative as a renewable energy source and rapidly growing market since last decade. The performance of a solar photovoltaic array PV is dependent upon the temperature and irradiance level and {{it is necessary to}} study the characteristics of photovoltaic (PV) array. The solar photovoltaic modules can be modelled on the electrical equivalent model of solar cell. The two-diode model based Solar PV simulator is proposed with partial shading capability with bypass and <b>blocking</b> <b>diode</b> effect and the parameters: reverse saturation current and resistances are computed using the circuit equations associated with the electrical models of solar cell. The mathematical computational scheme for modelling is simplified for two diode model with better accuracy. The two diode based modelling method proposed for PV simulator in MATLAB-Simulink used the computational data of the first diode equation and the computation of second diode equation is replaced by the coefficient multiplied with the data of first diode. This simulator model accuracy is analysed for the combined effect of irradiance and temperature as according to the standard PV module datasheet. Incremental conductance MPPT algorithm is utilized through dc-dc converter to track MPP and boost the dc voltage for required application. One of the most efficient and adequate application and utilization of power generated through PV is operation in grid connected mode. The grid integration of PV system requires a power electronics interface capable of conversion from dc-ac. Voltage source inverter(VSI) used as a power electronics interface and dc voltage as an input to converter have to be regulated to the required level for the power flow from converter side to load/grid side. It may be difficult to achieve good control of dc voltage using conventional PI controller having only one-degree-of-freedom (1 -DOF) due to the trade-off between overshoot (in step response) and disturbance response. 2 -DOF controller is reported and implemented for dc voltage control. The PLL is used for the grid frequency synchronization and SRFT, PBT and fryze conductance theory has been discussed for reference current generation. LCL filter is comprehensively designed with passive damping to minimize the ripple generated through VSI. The controller gains of dc voltage is optimally tuned using proposed application of data driven tuning method (FRIT) programmed in MATLAB basedupon the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The fundamental idea related to FRIT method is the extraction of input and output data, reference model setting and range of controller gains. Also, the better set point and transient response is reported considering performance parameters. Grid integrated PV system is modelled in MATLAB-Simulink and some part of the modelling also developed in Xilinx system generator (XSG) used for DSP and FPGA design.
