60|$|When Mr. Tulliver first {{knew the}} fact that the law-suit was decided against him, and that Pivart and Wakem were triumphant, every one who {{happened}} to observe him at the time thought that, for so confident and hot-tempered a man, he bore the blow remarkably well. He thought so himself; he {{thought he was going to}} show that if Wakem or anybody else considered him crushed, they would find themselves mistaken. He could not refuse to see that the costs of this protracted suit would take more than he possessed to pay them; but he appeared to himself to be full of expedients by which he could ward off any results but such as were tolerable, and could avoid the appearance of breaking down in the world. All the obstinacy and defiance of his nature, driven out of their old channel, found a vent for themselves in the immediate formation of plans by which he would meet his difficulties, and remain Mr. Tulliver of Dorlcote Mill in spite of them. There was such a rush of projects in his brain, that it was no wonder his face was flushed when he came away from his talk with his attorney, Mr. Gore, and mounted his horse to ride home from Lindum. There was Furley, who held the mortgage on the land,--a reasonable fellow, who would see his own interest, Mr. Tulliver was convinced, and who would be glad not only to purchase the whole estate, including the mill and homestead, but would accept Mr. Tulliver as tenant, and be willing to advance money to be repaid with high interest out of the profits of the business, which would be made over to him, Mr. Tulliver only taking enough barely to maintain himself and his family. Who would neglect such a profitable investment? Certainly not Furley, for Mr. Tulliver had determined that Furley should meet his plans with the utmost alacrity; and there are men whoses brains have not yet been dangerously heated by the loss of a lawsuit, who are apt to see in their own interest or desires a motive for other men's actions. There was no doubt (in the miller's mind) that Furley would do just what was desirable; and if he did--why, things would not be so very much worse. Mr. Tulliver and his family must live more meagrely and humbly, but it would only be till the profits of the business had paid off Furley's advances, and that might be while Mr. Tulliver had still a good many years of life before him. It was clear that the costs of the suit could be paid without his being obliged to turn out of his old place, and look like a ruined man. It was certainly an awkward moment in his affairs. There was that suretyship for poor Riley, who had died suddenly last April, and left his friend saddled with a debt of two hundred and fifty pounds,--a fact which had helped to make Mr. Tulliver's <b>banking</b> <b>book</b> less pleasant reading than a man might desire toward Christmas. Well! he had never been one of those poor-spirited sneaks who would refuse to give a helping hand to a fellow-traveller in this puzzling world. The really vexatious business was {{the fact that}} some months ago the creditor who had lent him the five hundred pounds to repay Mrs. Glegg had become uneasy about his money (set on by Wakem, of course), and Mr. Tulliver, still confident that he should gain his suit, and finding it eminently inconvenient to raise the said sum until that desirable issue had taken place, had rashly acceded to the demand that he should give a bill of sale on his household furniture and some other effects, as security in lieu of the bond. It was all one, he had said to himself; he should soon pay off the money, and there was no harm in giving that security any more than another. But now the consequences of this bill of sale occurred to him in a new light, and he remembered that the time was close at hand when it would be enforced unless the money were repaid. Two months ago he would have declared stoutly that he would never be beholden to his wife's friends; but now he told himself as stoutly that it was nothing but right and natural that Bessy should go to the Pullets and explain the thing to them; they would hardly let Bessy's furniture be sold, and it might be security to Pullet if he advanced the money,--there would, after all, be no gift or favor in the matter. Mr. Tulliver would never have asked for anything from so poor-spirited a fellow for himself, but Bessy might do so if she liked.|$|E

40|$|Because {{publicly}} available measures of deposit runoff risk are scarce, regulators’ models to measure {{interest rate risk}} in the <b>banking</b> <b>book</b> are based on very coarse assumptions about the allotment of non-maturity deposits within the regulatory maturity ladder. Using well-established statistical approaches, we address this issue by developing a methodology that considers deposits’ actual behavior {{in terms of both}} price sensitivity to changes in market rates and volume stability over time. Our model extends the current knowledge of public measures of interest rate risk and can be applied to {{publicly available}} data in a manner replicable by those outside of banking institutions. We find that the use of different allotment criteria affects not only the size of the risk indicator but also the nature of banks’ risk exposure, determining the risk inversion phenomenon—that is, banks exposed to an increase in interest rates can experience a reduction in their equity economic value if interest rates decrease. Overall, our results confirm the importance of accurate non-maturity deposits modeling for estimating interest rate risk in the <b>banking</b> <b>book...</b>|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Risk Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Banks and {{financial}} institutions record core banking activities (taking deposits and making loans) {{on the balance}} sheet of the <b>banking</b> <b>book,</b> but trading book (trading and investment) pursuits are recorded off-balance-sheet. Both books are subject to considerable risk from numerous sources, but regulatory capital reserves - to shield from unexpected market moves - are not required for the <b>banking</b> <b>book</b> as they are for the trading book. Both of these substantial shortcomings will be addressed in the near future. The 2005 initiation of new global accounting standards will ensure that trading book derivative fair values are recorded and reported on the balance sheet while the new Basel accord, due for full implementation in 2007, will regulate the calculation and reservation of capital required for the <b>banking</b> <b>book.</b> These changes are expected to better regulate and manage the transparency of financial institutions' activities and so prevent large scale economic disasters or deliberate corporate fraud. Institutions not compliant with the new rules will face severe financial losses, regulatory fines and possible debilitating legal action. One of the most commonly-used tools for measuring and managing interest rate risk, the Macaulay duration, has enjoyed almost unchallenged success, but it employs severely restrictive and unrealistic assumptions which constrain its usefulness and reliability in the rapidly-changing world of defaultable securities, those with embedded derivatives and instruments with perpetual maturities. Robust measures which more accurately approximate interest rate risk by relaxing unrealistic assumptions are required. Applications which significantly improve {{the accuracy of the}} Macaulay duration are considered as well as a new look at the duration problem in general. The influence of a more accurate duration measure on duration gap provides a significantly improved economic Market Value of Equity. The role of this enhanced measure is crucial for risk management as well as regulatory and accounting compliance. Doctora...|$|E
