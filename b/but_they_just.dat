[...] Carl elaborated: [...] " [...] was Brian's favorite kind of rock; he liked [...] better than the early Beatles stuff. He loved the Beatles' later music when they evolved and started making intelligent, masterful music, but before that Phil was it." [...] According to Mike Love, Carl followed the Beatles more closely than anyone else in the group, but Brian was the most [...] "rattled" [...] by the Beatles, feeling tremendous pressure to [...] "keep pace" [...] with them. Brian once characterized himself as [...] "fucked up" [...] and [...] "jealous" [...] of Spector and the Beatles, saying; [...] "i was flipping out.

[...] On another occasion, he's said that he was overwhelmed by the [...] "electricity" [...] of their voices on the song ("It really turned me on").

The Guardians Phelim O'Neill gave Magicians two stars, calling it [...] "Peep Show the sequel", and stated that [...] "O'Connor's direction has absolutely zero visual flair, making the performers' transition from television to film rather pointless." [...] The Times Dominic Maxwell decided that [...] "Magicians doesn't have the brio (or great gags), let alone the marketability, of a Bridget Jones."
