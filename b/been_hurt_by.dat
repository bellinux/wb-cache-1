In order to gain the backing of the Indians, he started a campaign against the aristocratic landowners, seized their land, and incited the Indians to destroy the homes of the landowners. He also hoped to get the support of the artisans who had <b>been</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>by</b> the free-trade policies of Ballivián by restricting the role of foreign merchants in Bolivia and limiting imports.|$|E

Additionally, newspapers are seeing traditional advertisers shift to new media platforms. The classified category is shifting to sites including Craigslist, employment websites, and auto sites. National advertisers are shifting to many types of digital content including websites, rich media platforms, and mobile.|$|E

25|$|Assad {{called his}} {{domestic}} reforms a corrective movement, and it achieved some results. He tried to modernize Syria's agricultural and industrial sectors; {{one of his}} main achievements was {{the completion of the}} Tabqa Dam on the Euphrates River in 1974. One of the world's largest dams, its reservoir was called Lake Assad. The reservoir increased irrigation of arable land, provided electricity, and encouraged industrial and technical development in Syria. Many peasants and workers received increased income, social security, and better health and educational services.

25|$|The {{education}} system has also <b>been</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>by</b> {{the increase of}} nurses in the Philippines. As Filipinos are attracted to working as nurses, the number of nursing students has steadily increased. As a result, the number of nursing programs has grown quickly in a commercialized manner. In the 1970s, there were only 40 nursing schools in the Philippines; by 2005 the number had grown to 441 nursing colleges. While the education opportunities for nursing students has grown tremendously, {{the quality of education}} has declined. This can be seen by the low rate (50%) of students who pass the nursing exam since the 1990s. Furthermore, the Technical Committee on Nursing Education of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) determined that 23% of Filipino nursing schools failed to meet the requirements set by the government.|$|E

25|$|The {{market has}} also had famous seller, such as Ignacio Contreras, better known as “El Chacharitas,” who was noted among {{collectors}} as able to obtain all kinds of valuable objects at elevated prices. However, those {{who knew how to}} bargain could obtain significant discounts. El Chacharitas states that the sale of antiques was a very good business in the past but less so now. Much of the reason is the degradation of the neighborhood, and the invasion of those selling mass-produced, unlicensed and counterfeit merchandise. The antiques market also has <b>been</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>by</b> Mexico City mayor Marcelos Ebrard’s decision to close roads in and around the historic center as well as Paseo de la Reforma to vehicular traffic on Sundays, the day this market operates. For some vendors, business is down by as much as sixty percent, as many upper class residents will not use public transportation to get to this market.|$|E
25|$|Associated Press {{reported}} that {{in response to the}} costs that the legislation places on banks, some banks have ended the practice of giving their customers free checking. Small banks have been forced to end some businesses such as mortgages and car loans in response to the new regulations. The size of regulatory compliance teams has grown. The Heritage Foundation, calling attention to the new ability of borrowers to sue lenders for misjudging their ability to repay a loan, predicted that smaller lenders would be forced to exit the mortgage market due to increased risk. One study has shown that smaller banks have <b>been</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>by</b> the regulations of the Dodd–Frank Act. Community banks' share of the US banking assets and lending market fell from over 40% in 1994 to around 20% today, although this is a misleading at best but highly likely inaccurate number considering the Dodd-Frank was implemented 16 years later than 1994. These experts believe that regulatory barriers fall most heavily on small banks, even though legislators intended to target large financial institutions.|$|E
25|$|In the {{subsequent}} story, The Edge of Destruction, {{tensions between the}} TARDIS crew reach the point of overt conflict when he accuses them of trying to sabotage the TARDIS {{in an attempt to}} return to 1963. Barbara remains level-headed and logical, allowing the Doctor to trace the source of the distress to telepathic influences from the TARDIS (which is trying to warn them of a major failure). Seeing that Barbara has <b>been</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>by</b> his accusations, the Doctor apologises and begins to realise he can rely on the two teachers, sealing a friendship which lasts until their eventual departure from the TARDIS. Although mutually respectful and increasingly affectionate, the relationship between the Doctor and Barbara is often tested by their opposing viewpoints. In The Aztecs, Barbara is mistaken for the reincarnation of a high priest, Yetaxa, after they find her in possession of his bracelet. Barbara seizes this opportunity to change the course of history, and tries to persuade the Aztecs to abandon human sacrifice, so that by the time Hernán Cortés - who overthrew the Aztec empire - lands he will find a glorious civilisation. The Doctor warns Barbara that she cannot rewrite history, but his protests fall on deaf ears. Barbara fails and, although she has influenced some Aztecs, history remains on course.|$|E

500|$|Great Captain Island {{is one of}} the state's 26 [...] "important bird areas" [...] {{that provide}} an {{essential}} habitat for one or more bird species, according to the Connecticut Audubon Society. Great blue herons have been on the island since the 1990s. Great egrets, snowy egrets, and black-crowned night herons also live on the island. [...] The island was once known as the state's largest heron and egret rookery, but in the early 2000s their populations shrunk dramatically, with summer counts down from a total of 364 in 1998 to 98 in 2004. Patrick Comins, director of bird conservation for Audubon Connecticut, thinks that the bird populations have <b>been</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>by</b> human disturbances and possibly by competition from cormorants and a great horned owl that lives on the island and has fed on the birds. Comins also said that overall pollution in Long Island Sound waters might also have an effect.|$|E
500|$|In First Contact, the {{individually}} inscrutable and faceless Borg {{fulfill the}} role of the similarly unreadable whale in Melville's work. Picard, like Ahab, has <b>been</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>by</b> his nemesis, and author Elizabeth Hinds said it makes sense that Picard should [...] "opt for the perverse alternative of remaining on board ship to fight" [...] the Borg rather than take the only sensible option left, to destroy the ship. Several lines in the film refer to the 21st-century dwellers being primitive, with the people of the 24th century having evolved to a more utopian society. In the end it is Lily (the 21st-century woman) who shows Picard (the 24th-century man) that his quest for revenge is the primitive behavior that humans had evolved to not use. Lily's words cause Picard to reconsider, and he quotes Ahab's words of vengeance, recognizing the death wish embedded therein.|$|E
500|$|Boys Don't Cry {{garnered}} significant {{attention for}} its graphic rape scene. The film was initially assigned an NC-17 rating from the MPAA; the content was toned {{down for the}} U.S. release, where it was rated R. Peirce was interviewed for a 2005 documentary titled This Film Is Not Yet Rated, which discussed the film's problems with the MPAA, particularly the censoring of the sex scenes. The portrayal of a double rape caused significant problems with the MPAA {{and had to be}} trimmed to avoid the NC-17 rating. Both the Australian and European version are more explicit, particularly the first rape. Peirce was angry because the MPAA wanted the sex scene between Brandon and Lana removed but was satisfied with the level of brutality in the murder scene. She also claimed that one objection from the MPAA was that one scene featured an orgasm that was [...] "too long", and rhetorically asked if anyone had every <b>been</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>by</b> an orgasm that was too long.|$|E
