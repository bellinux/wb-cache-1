In the following chapter, one- and two-dimensional pulse experiments, both for homo- and for heteronuclear spin systems are discussed.

Electron-impact (EI) and negative chemical ionization (NCI) mass spectrometry were used, and their application in environmental analyses documented. NCI shows increased sensitivity to all PCDFs and PCDDs except for 2, 3, 7, 8 - and other tetra-CDD isomers. The identification of the various PCDFs and PCDDs, specifically the identification of the toxic and hazardous 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted isomers is emphasized; the unambiguous identification of all 2, 3, 7, 8,-substituted PCDDs is documented. The application of HRGC and mass spectrometry to isomer-specific analyses of samples of aquatic species from the Baltic and the Great Lakes is shown. Results from this and previous studies indicate PCDF and PCDD residues in these organisms including significant levels of 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted isomers. These aquatic species apparently show preferential retention or reduced metabolization rates for these toxic isomers. The results of samples from the Baltic indicate a contamination primarily due to PCDFs. The origin of this contamination seems complex and related to PCBs as well as chlorophenols. PCDF and PCDD isomer distribution patterns from analyses using HRGC and mass spectrometry aid in the identification of origin, sources and elucidation of routes of formation of these compounds.

40|$|In several {{accidents}} (fires, explosions) involving electrical systems containing {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} (PCBs) or benzenes (PCBZs), {{the formation of}} polychlorinated tricyclic aromatic compounds such as polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and <b>biphenylenes</b> (PCBPs) was observed. These findings were not surprising in light of our previous studies on the formation of PCDFs and PCDDs from the thermolysis (500 - 750 degrees C in presence of air) of PCBs or PCBZs. In these experiments we identified three main and a fourth minor reaction pathway leading to PCDFs from PCBs. The three main reactions involved the loss of ortho-Cl 2, and the losses of ortho-HCl with and without a 2, 3 -chlorine shift. The fourth, minor reaction route found with some PCBs, involved the loss of ortho-H 2. These reaction pathways were intramolecular cyclizations via oxidation to phenolic compounds. Thermolysis of commercial PCBs (Aroclor 1254 and 1260) yielded the same PCDF isomers as expected from the main PCB components via these four reaction pathways; the isomers formed included the toxic 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted tetra-, penta- and hexa-CDFs. Thermolysis of PCBZs involved complex condensation reactions with multiple rearrangements leading to PCDFs as well as PCDDs. Again oxidation to phenolic products was involved but the reaction routes are not yet fully elucidated. The results of samples from transformer and capacitor accident sites showed very complex PCDF mixtures with 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted isomers as main components and originating from the PCBs in the transformer liquid. The unusual presence of PCDDs in samples from the Binghamton accident originates from PCBZs present in transformer fluid of that specific installation, thus confirming our previous thermolysis findings.

40|$|In this work, novel {{materials}} for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been synthesized and characterized. In the first part, {{the development of}} new host {{materials for}} blue phosphorescent OLEDs is described. These compounds have to fulfill three major requirements: they should possess good charge-transport properties, a stable amorphous phase at operation temperature and, most importantly, their triplet energy E(T 1 S 0) has to exceed the triplet energy of the emitter. Therefore the conjugated π–system has to be confined. Two different approaches have been pursued: First, the examination of dibenzofurofurans as a novel moiety with a large conjugated π–system, yet high (calculated) triplet energy. Secondly, tetraphenylene was used as a novel molecular design element to connect moieties known for their good charge-transporting properties with little conjugation between these fragments. The properties of all potential target molecules have first been predicted by DFT-calculations. For the most promising candidates, synthetic routes have been developed and executed. In the course of this work, seven novel dibenzofurofuran-based host materials were synthesized, revealing a surprisingly high reactivity of this class of compounds. Furthermore, five new carbazole- and dibenzofuran-annelated tetraphenylenes have been obtained by dimerization of the corresponding <b>biphenylenes.</b> All final products were characterized using UV/Vis-, fluorescence- and phosphorescence spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and differential scanning calorimetry. In this way, the most important parameters of a host material, transport levels (ionization potential, electron affinity), triplet energy and glass-transition temperature were determined. Almost all of the obtained compounds show a high glass-transition temperature of Tg > 100 °C, transport levels close to those of other common OLED materials and a high triplet energy of E(T 1 S 0) > 2. 7 eV.

40|$|Known {{methods of}} {{generating}} arynes, and their chemical reactions, have been classified, {{and some new}} syntheses and reactions are described. A series of substituted 1 -aminobenzotriazoles were synthesised from the corresponding o-nitroanilines by considerable modification of the literature method. These compounds were also synthesised by the amination of the corresponding benzotriazoles, using hydroxylamine-o-sulphonic acid. This reaction afforded the isomeric 2 -aminobenzotriazole in the unsubstituted case only. Oxidation of the substituted 1 -aminobenzotriazoles with lead tetra-acetate was accompanied by elimination of nitrogen from the nitrene initially formed, to yield the free aryne. The degree of dimerisation of the arynes, to give the corresponding <b>biphenylenes,</b> was found to vary with the substitution of aryne. 3 -Nitrobenzyne afforded no dimer, forming instead 3 -nitrophenyl acetate. Benzyne and 4 -methoxybenzyne were shown to react as a symmetric singlet by the stereospecificity of the reaction with trans, trans-hexa- 2, 4 -diene. Evidence {{for the existence of}} 3 -nitrobenzyne in this electronic state was also found; semi-empirical calculations predicted benzyne, 4 -nitrobenzyne and 3 -nitrobenzyne to exist in the singlet ground state. The reactivities of several arynes were compared by the relative degree of 2 + 2 cycloaddition to vinyl acetate. 3 -Nitrobenzyne was found to be highly reactive; semi-empirical calculations showed that this species had an unusually high dipole moment, and the reactivity was explained in terms of the polarity between the non-bonded o-orbitals. Evidence for the intermediacy of 2, 2 '-dehydrobiphenyl in the dimerisation of benzyne was found. Certain arynes cleaved dialkyl ethers to give the phenyl alkyl ether. The "ene" reaction was extended to acetylenes, phenyl allenes being the products.

In this work we report such a phase transformation between two carbon allotropes, from penta-graphene (a semiconductor) into <b>biphenylene</b> (a metal) under uniaxial loading.
