He sometimes has had anxiety attacks before games, struggled to sleep, and considered suicide. Owumi received an offer to play another season with El-Olympi. The contract, two times that from his first year in Egypt, would have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> contract of his career and would have made him the best-paid player to ever play in the Middle East. Initially accepting the deal, he later decided against it because he wanted to take a break from his basketball career.

25|$|Player safety {{has become}} a major issue within the past five years and concussions, which result from a hard hit to the head, have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> cause. With recent studies showing how concussions can affect retired players and how it has {{decreased}} their quality of life after retirement, concussions have become a very important topic of debate when it comes to player safety issues. This had significant effects on the league as elite players were being taken out of the game, such as Sidney Crosby being sidelined for approximately 10 and a half months, which adversely affected the league's marketability. As a result, in December 2009, Brendan Shanahan was hired to replace Colin Campbell and given the role of Senior Vice-President of Player Safety. Shanahan began to hand out suspensions on high-profile perpetrators responsible for dangerous hits, such as Raffi Torres receiving 25 games for his hit on Marian Hossa.|$|E

500|$|Jagnow {{commented on}} several changes the {{developers}} {{would have made}} in hindsight {{after the completion of}} the ARG. One aspect he considered was the weak part of the fiction of the ARG, something he believed they would have integrated more in the game from the start. The release of the Potato Sack on April 1 may have been a bad decision according to Jagnow, as they did not get the press exposure they thought they would in conjunction with the other April Fool's events occurring that day, with some media outlets hesitant to report on potential pranks for fear of having to retract these later. In the third phase, where certain players were [...] "taken over" [...] by GLaDOS, Jagnow felt they extracted these players from the game too early as they were influential in coordinating the chat rooms and wiki, leaving the remaining players confused. Instead, Jagnow suggested they should {{have found a way to}} allow these players to continue participating until near the end. Jagnow considered the push of the crescendo of the ARG, the [...] "appearance" [...] of GLaDOS@Home, to have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> failing. Originally scheduled for April 16 or 17, it was pushed to April 15 to allow more players, including international ones, to participate in the effort to release Portal 2 early, and to gain media attention. [...] Instead, the developers found that existing players of the ARG were frustrated with no new puzzles to solves, while new players brought to the site by the media were skeptical and saw the event as [...] "a cheap media ploy to get players to buy the Potato Sack in the hope of an early Portal 2 release".|$|E
500|$|Nobuo Uematsu {{composed}} {{the music of}} Final Fantasy VII in less than one year, matching the game's development time, although he had taken two years to create the soundtrack for the previous title, Final Fantasy VI. Final Fantasy VII was the first game in the series to be developed for the PlayStation, and while the media capabilities of the console allowed for CD quality music, Uematsu opted instead to use MIDI sounds. This decision has been credited as giving the soundtrack [...] "a very distinctive mood and feel", forming a strong association for listeners between the game and its soundtrack. The music was rendered using the console's native sound chip rather than being incorporated onto the disc due to superior overall sound quality: while the SNES had only eight sound channels, the PlayStation had twenty-four. Eight were reserved for sound effects, leaving sixteen available for the music. Uematsu had initially planned to use CD quality music with vocal performances for the game {{to take advantage of}} the console's capabilities, but found that the advanced audio quality in turn made the game have much longer loading times in each area. Uematsu decided that the quality was not worth the affects on gameplay, though after the release and seeing Suikoden II (1998, PlayStation), which had used higher-quality music instead, he reversed his stance for Final Fantasy VIII. There was a plan to use a [...] "famous vocalist" [...] for the ending theme to the game as a [...] "theme song" [...] for the game, but the shift to MIDI, along with time constraints and thematic concerns, caused the idea to be dropped. Uematsu has stated, however, that the move into the [...] "PlayStation era", which allowed video game composers to use sounds recorded in the studio rather than from synthesizers, had [...] "definitely <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> change" [...] to video game music.|$|E
500|$|Beginning with Final Fantasy VII (1997), {{the series}} moved {{platforms}} to the PlayStation. While the media {{capabilities of the}} PlayStation allowed for CD quality music, Uematsu opted instead to use Sequence format. The soundtrack album ran a record four discs, and Uematsu has stated that the move into the [...] "PlayStation era", which allowed video game composers to use sounds recorded in the studio rather than from synthesizers, had [...] "definitely <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> change" [...] to video game music. VII was the first game in the series to include a track with digitized vocals, [...] "One-Winged Angel", which {{has been described as}} Uematsu's [...] "most recognizable contribution" [...] to the music of the series. The piece, described as [...] "a fanfare to impending doom", is said to not [...] "follow any normal genre rules" [...] and has been termed [...] "possibly the most innovative idea in the series' musical history." [...] The lyrics of the piece, a Latin choral track which plays at the climax of the game, were taken from the medieval poetry on which Carl Orff based his Carmina Burana, specifically the songs [...] "Estuans Interius", [...] "O Fortuna", [...] "Veni, Veni, Venias" [...] and [...] "Ave Formosissima". There was a plan to use a [...] "famous vocalist" [...] for the ending piece as a [...] "theme song" [...] for the game, but the idea was dropped due to time constraints and thematic concerns. The idea of a theme song would be resurrected in the following installment of the series. In 2006, IGN ranked VIIs music the best Final Fantasy soundtrack to date and cited the [...] "gripping" [...] character tracks and [...] "One-Winged Angel" [...] in particular as contributing factors. The discography of the original game only includes soundtrack, best of, and piano albums. However, beginning in 2005 Square Enix produced a collection of media centered on the game and world of Final Fantasy VII entitled the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. This collection has produced five additional soundtrack albums, each for a different game or animation.|$|E
