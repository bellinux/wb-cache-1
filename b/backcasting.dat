[...] The solution is not so much based on an agreed agenda, or an investment in higher authority whether divine or political, but rather a self-organized network of mutually supportive mechanisms, resulting in a viable politico-economic social fabric. The principal technique for inducing convergence is thought experiment, namely <b>backcasting,</b> enabling anyone to participate no matter what cultural background, religious doctrine, political affiliation or age demographic.

50|$|The {{framework}} bases its planning {{approach on}} a concept called <b>backcasting</b> {{and more specifically}} <b>backcasting</b> from sustainability principles. <b>Backcasting</b> {{is the process of}} moving backwards from an imagined vision of success. One begins with an end in mind, moves backwards from the vision to the present, and moves step-by-step towards the vision. It is essentially placing ourselves in the future, imagining that we have achieved success and looking back to ask the question: “What do we need to do today to reach that successful outcome?”. Instead of picturing how success could look like, <b>backcasting</b> is advocated from a principled vision of success in which specific conditions are met creates a shared understanding of success.|$|E
50|$|<b>Backcasting</b> {{is both an}} {{important}} aid in determining the direction technology development must take and in specifying the targets to be set for this purpose. As such, <b>backcasting</b> is an ideal search toward determining the nature {{and scope of the}} technological challenge posed by sustainable development, and it can thus serve to direct the search process toward new — sustainable — technology.|$|E

50|$|In {{statistics}} and data analysis, <b>backcasting</b> {{can be considered}} the opposite of forecasting. Whereas forecasting is predicting the future (unknown) values of the dependent variables based on known values of the independent variable, <b>backcasting</b> can be considered the prediction of the unknown values {{of the independent variables}} that might have existed to explain the known values of the dependent variable.|$|E
50|$|The {{activity}} of <b>backcasting</b> — the term <b>backcasting</b> was coined by John Robinson in 1982 — involves establishing {{the description of}} a very definite and very specific future situation. It then involves an imaginary moving backwards in time, step-by-step, in as many stages as are considered necessary, from the future to the present to reveal the mechanism through which that particular specified future could be attained from the present.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Backcasting</b> is a {{planning}} method {{that starts with}} defining a desirable future and then works backwards to identify policies and programs that will connect that specified future to the present. The fundamentals of the method were outlined by John. B Robinson from the University of Waterloo in 1990. The fundamental question of <b>backcasting</b> asks: [...] "if we want to attain a certain goal, what actions {{must be taken to}} get there?" [...] Forecasting is the process of predicting the future based on current trend analysis. <b>Backcasting</b> approaches the challenge of discussing the future from the opposite direction. a method in which the future desired conditions are envisioned and steps are then defined to attain those conditions, rather than taking steps that are merely a continuation of present methods extrapolated into the future ...|$|E

50|$|Bamboo rods {{produce a}} smooth, fluid <b>backcast</b> which {{provides}} its own 'damping' effect {{at the end}} of the <b>backcast.</b> The forward cast accelerates the line throw through the air with the same 'damping' effect at the beginning of the cast, and then again {{at the end of}} the cast as the caster lays the line out over the target water—generally with smooth, precise placement. Expert fisherman and enthusiasts alike have heralded the performance of the bamboo rod as being likened to that of a fine musical instrument. Master craftsman and bamboo innovators such as: H.L. Leonard, E.W. Edwards, Jim Payne (fishing rodmaker) and Everett Garrison have elevated the bamboo fly rod from the realm of sporting goods to that of fine art.|$|R
50|$|<b>Backcasting</b> is {{increasingly}} used in urban planning and resource management {{of water and}} energy. It was used by Peter Gleick and colleagues at the Pacific Institute in a 1995 study on California water policy, {{as an alternative to}} traditional California water planning approaches. In 2006, the Capital Regional District Water Services, which services the greater Victoria area in British Columbia, Canada, committed to <b>backcasting</b> to the year 2050 as a formal element of all future strategic water planning initiatives.|$|E

40|$|This paper compares 10 -year <b>backcast</b> {{projections}} of U. S. petroleum consumption for the 2000 - 2009 period {{based upon a}} range of functional forms.

One structural approach performed considerably better than all other approaches including the univariate model. This specification is the autoregressive distributed lag (ADL) model that allowed oil demand to respond differently (asymmetrically) to price increases and decreases. Certain forms of this equation, however, do well while others perform poorly.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{construct}} a possible future scenario for South Africa in Africa using the <b>backcast</b> approach. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology followed is to present a brief political and economic history of African colonization and de-colonization, globalisation and the rise of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICs). Strengths and weaknesses are discussed and used to sketch a desired future scenario from which the <b>backcast</b> is constructed. Findings: It is suggested that the optimal future is one involving SADC-MERCOSUR alliance with South Africa and Brazil as the respective leaders Research limitations/implications: A study of this kind is necessarily speculative. Practical implications: The paper alerts policy makers to the threats and opportunities inherent in south-south dialogue. Social implications: The prospect of collaboration holds promise of social upliftment in the region. Originality/value: The arguments are original to the author. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

40|$|Climate is complex, uncertain, and, over horizons {{that are}} {{relevant}} for policy decisions, varies little. Using evidence-based (scientific) forecasting principles, we determined that for such a situation a naïve “no change ” extrapolation method was the appropriate benchmark. We tested this benchmark against global mean temperatures. To be useful to policy makers, a proposed forecasting method would have to provide forecasts that were substantially more accurate than the benchmark. We calculated benchmark forecasts against the UK Met Office Hadley Centre’s annual average thermometer data from 1850 through 2007. The accuracy of forecasts from our naïve model is such that even perfect forecasts {{would be unlikely to}} help policy makers. For example, mean absolute errors for 20 - and 50 -year horizons were 0. 18 °C and 0. 24 °C. We nevertheless evaluated the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s 1992 projected warming rate of 0. 03 °C-per-year. The small sample of errors from ex ante forecasts for 1992 through 2008 was practically indistinguishable from the naïve benchmark errors. To get a larger sample and evidence on longer horizons we <b>backcast</b> successively from 1974 to 1850.

40|$|Inadequacies of {{conventional}} investment justification methodologies in Advanced Manufacturing Technology (AMT) cases are well known. The inadequacies mainly stem from exclusion of qualitative and 2 ̆ 2 intangible 2 ̆ 2 factors when evaluating AMT investment proposals. To address the problem, {{a framework of}} AMT planning and justification is presented in this paper. The framework takes a 2 ̆ 7 <b>backcast</b> 2 ̆ 7 approach, in which the AMT acquisition is modelled as an essential effort {{in a process of}} building manufacturing capabilities for a firm 2 ̆ 7 s long term competitiveness positioning. The intangible benefits associated with AMT acquisitions are explicitly considered and modelled as a set of manufacturing capability measures. Non-financial, or activity-based performance measures are adapted. Planning of AMT acquisition is modelled as a 2 ̆ 2 <b>backcast</b> 2 ̆ 2 process consisting of identification of capability upgrading needs, or 2 ̆ 7 capability gaps 2 ̆ 7, in manufacturing bases, with respect to manufacturing strategic objectives, and selection of appropriate AMT programs to close the gaps.

We estimate <b>backcasts,</b> nowcasts and forecasts for GDP, components of GDP, and GDP of all individual euro area members, and examine forecasts for periods of low and high economic volatility (more specifically, we consider 2002 - 2007, which falls into the ‘Great Moderation’, and the ‘Great Recession’ 2008 - 2009). We find that all models consistently beat naive AR benchmarks, and overall, the dynamic factor model tends to outperform the PMI model (at times by a wide margin). However, accuracy of the dynamic factor model can be uneven (forecasts for some countries have large errors), with the PMI model dominating clearly for some countries or over some horizons.
