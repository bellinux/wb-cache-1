2500|$|Mountain unicycling (abbreviated to muni) {{consists}} of riding specialized unicycles on mountain bike trails or otherwise off-roading. Mountain unicycles have thicker, wider tires for shock absorption. Many riders {{choose to use}} long cranks to increase power when riding up hills and over rough terrain. A disk brake is sometimes used for descents, the <b>brake</b> <b>handle</b> {{is attached to the}} underside of the handle {{on the front of the}} saddle ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{with any}} other bicycle, the chain should be checked making sure the master link is {{securely}} latched. [...] The chain can be lubricated monthly for smooth riding. [...] Also, as needed, the brakes should be tightened as they wear and tire condition observed for possible puncture locations. [...] Air pressure in the tires, tire alignment, <b>brake</b> <b>handle</b> placement, and rust should be monitored {{on a daily basis}} because they can change very easily during a jarring ride.|$|E
2500|$|The {{compressor}} on {{the locomotive}} charges the main reservoir with air at [...] The train brakes are released by admitting {{air to the}} train pipe through the engineer's brake valve. A fully charged brake pipe is typically [...] for freight trains and [...] for passenger trains. The brakes are applied when the engineer moves the <b>brake</b> <b>handle</b> to the [...] "service" [...] position, which causes a reduction in pressure in the train pipe. In normal braking, the pressure in the train pipe does not reduce to zero. If it does fall to zero, (e.g., because of a broken brake hose) an emergency brake application will be made.|$|E
5000|$|Passenger trains {{usually have}} {{emergency}} <b>brake</b> <b>handles</b> (or a [...] "communication cord") {{that the public}} can operate. Misuse is punished by a heavy fine.|$|R

2500|$|When it {{had been}} decided to {{transfer}} the Composites to the elevated division of the IRT in 1916, the cars' braking was modernized further. In AMRE schedule braking, the electric brake must be activated at all times by use of the electric brake key to synchronize the train's braking effort electrically. If it was not [...] "cut in" [...] or failed en route, the system could still be manipulated to apply the brakes pneumatically. This would still allow the train to stop, but deceleration would take longer such as on the older AM(P) schedule braking. However, in AMRE, the notches in the brake stand to cause this pneumatic application are completely separate from the notches to cause an electric application. Therefore, if a motorman with a defective or inactive electric AMRE brake were to electrically apply the brakes, nothing would happen! Valuable seconds would be lost while he realized his electric brake was inactive, before he could move to the pneumatic apply notch to begin slowing his train down (which would still take longer than usual without electric synchronization of the brakes). In a serious scenario, this could cause him to overshoot a station or an important stopping point, or overspeed. In a new braking schedule known as AMUE, however, the electric and pneumatic notches are joined together on the motorman's brake stand. Therefore, even if the electric brake is defective or inactive, his moving the <b>brake</b> <b>handle</b> to the apply position would still begin setting up a pneumatic application of the brakes, creating a much quicker response to the condition than possible under any other previous system. As part of the modifications for elevated service, the Composites were equipped with AMUE schedule braking from 1916 until their retirement.|$|E

5000|$|The Pukka {{is powered}} by two 12-volt sealed {{lead-acid}} batteries contained in a rear compartment, held by the frame behind the seat. It has an electronic motor control board which uses pulse-width modulation, and can provide up to 55 amps when required. [...] It receives low voltage signals from the throttle, which {{is attached to the}} right handle bar. The braking system is a drum brake activated through a metal brake cable from a <b>brake</b> <b>handle</b> on the left handle bar. A circuit runs through the <b>brake</b> <b>handle</b> to allow the motor control board to detect when the brake is being used and shut off power to the motor. Thus, the Pukka is designed so that the motor and the brakes cannot be used at the same time.|$|E

5000|$|Goods {{and mineral}} {{vehicles}} {{were provided with}} hand brakes by which the brakes could be applied by a hand lever operated by staff on the ground. These hand brakes were used where necessary when vehicles were parked but also when these trains needed to descend a steep gradient; the train then stopped before descending and the guard walked forward to pin down the <b>handles</b> of sufficient <b>brakes</b> to give adequate braking effort. Early goods vehicles had <b>brake</b> <b>handles</b> on one side only and random alignment of the vehicles gave the guard sufficient braking but, from about 1930, so-called [...] "either-side" [...] <b>brake</b> <b>handles</b> were provided. These trains, not fitted with continuous brakes were described as [...] "unfitted" [...] trains and they survived in British practice until about 1985. However, from about 1930, semi-fitted trains were introduced, in which some goods vehicles were fitted with continuous brakes and a proportion of such vehicles marshalled next to the locomotive gave sufficient brake power to run at somewhat higher speeds than unfitted trains. A trial in January 1952 saw a 52-wagon, 850 ton, coal train run 127 mi {{at an average of}} 38 mph, compared to the usual coal train speed on the Midland main line of 15 mph, or 20 mph to 25 mph of [...] "fitted" [...] freights. By 1952 only 14% of open wagons, 55% of covered and 80% of cattle trucks had vacuum brakes.|$|R

50|$|On January 16, 1995, Pine was {{severely}} {{injured in a}} train accident in the suburb of Winnetka, where she taught violin lessons. As she was exiting a Metra commuter train with her violin over her shoulder, the doors closed on the strap to her case, pinning her left shoulder to the train. The doors, which were controlled remotely and had no safety sensors, failed to reopen, and she was dragged 366 ft by the train before being pulled underneath and run over, severing one leg and mangling the other. Pine was saved by the prompt application of tourniquets by several passengers who disembarked from the train after pulling its emergency <b>brake</b> <b>handles.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Each brake {{reservoir}} stores air at {{a pressure}} of 7 bar and is fed via a {{pressure reducing valve}} off the Main Reservoir Pipe.

Similarly, the hand <b>brake</b> <b>handles</b> may also be {{on one side of the}} wagons only. The L&B originally used side chains in conjunction with Norwegian couplers, but these were found to be unnecessary with the slow speeds employed (15 - 25 km/h) and were removed within a year or so of the line opening in 1898.
