40|$|Introduction: Foods {{including}} soy {{and dietary}} supplements {{are widely used}} for health benefits, particularly by menopausal women. Serum levels of T 3 and T 4 decrease in ovariectomized animals {{and on the other}} hand, Estradiol can increase levels of thyroid hormones. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of soy extract on the thyroid hormones in ovariectomized rats. Methods: Forty female wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups (ten animals in each) : Sham–operated (surgery without remove of ovaries), ovariectomized, treated (OVX+soy extract) and control-gavages (intact animals with soy extract). Animals in sham - operated and ovariectomized (OVX) groups received 0 / 5 ml normal saline <b>by</b> <b>gavages.</b> Animals of treated and control-gavages groups were treated with soy extracts 60 mg/kg/day in drinking water for 28 days <b>by</b> <b>gavages.</b> Results: The results showed that TSH serum level increased and serum levels of T 3 and T 4 decreased significantly in OVX group compared to the sham group (p 0. 000). Furthurmore, serum levels of T 3 and T 4 increased and TSH levels decreased significantly in the treated group compared to the OVX group (p 0. 000). Conclusions: Soy extract administration has a positive effect on serum concentrations of thyroid hormones in ovariectomized rats...|$|R

The present study was investigated to evaluate the effects of allium cepa on renal failur in male rats which experimentally infected by Toxoplasma gondii, RH strain. Methods: Wistar male rat (n= 40) were allocated into four groups, group one that received tachyzoites of T. gondii (ip) (n= 10), group two that received tachyzoites of T. gondii (ip), plus fresh onion juice <b>by</b> <b>gavages</b> method (n= 10), group three received just fresh onion juice <b>by</b> <b>gavages</b> method (n= 10) and control group (n= 10) that received nothing.

Kidney tissues of Rat in whole groups were removed and prepared for apopetosis analysis. Results: Serum protein and kidneys weights were significantly decreased in groups that were infected with T. gondii, in comparison to control and onions groups. Kidneys Apopetosis in toxoplasma group significantly increased in comparison to control group (P< 0. 05). level of TAC was significantly increased in groups that received onio juice (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: This study showed that T. gondii have significantly effect on serum protein and TAC, apopetosis and fresh onion juice returned and treated this harmful effect, so it is suggested that eating of onion is useful in toxoplasma infection...|$|R

50|$|Only mice {{have been}} colonized with ASF in experiments, since ASF {{bacteria}} originate from mice intestinal microbiome. Germfree mice are colonized by ASF {{through one of}} two methods.

50|$|Rodents {{are usually}} used in animal test. The {{chemicals}} undertest are usually administered {{in the food}} and in the drinking water, but sometimes by dermal application, <b>by</b> <b>gavage,</b> or by inhalation, and carried out over the {{major part of the}} life span for rodents. In tests that check for carcinogens, maximum tolerated dosage is first determined, then a range of doses are given to around 50 animals throughout the notional lifespan of the animal of two years. After death the animals are examined for sign of tumours. Differences in metabolism between rat and human however means that human may not respond {{in exactly the same way}} to mutagen, and dosages that produce tumours on the animal test may also be unreasonably high for a human, i.e. the equivalent amount required to produce tumours in human may far exceed what a person might encounter in real life. Mice with recessive mutations for a visible phenotype may also be used to check for mutagens. Females with recessive mutation crossed with wild-type males would yield the same phenotype as the wild-type, and any observable change to the phenotype would indicate that a mutation induced by the mutagen has occurred. Mice may also be used for dominant lethal assays where early embryonic deaths are monitored. Male mice are treated with chemicals under test, mated with females, and the females are then sacrificed before parturition and early fetal deaths are counted in the uterine horns. Transgenic Mouse Assay using a mouse strain infected with a viral shuttle vector is another method for testing mutagens. Animals are first treated with suspected mutagen, the mouse DNA is then isolated and the phage segment recovered and used to infect E. coli. Using similar method as the blue-white screen, the plaque formed with DNA containing mutation are white, while those without are blue.|$|E

40|$|Antioxidants have {{protective}} effects against free radicals-induced neural damage in Parkinson's disease (PD). We {{examined the effects}} of ellagic acid (EA) on locomotion, pallidal local EEG, and its frequency bands' power and also cerebral antioxidant contents in a rat model of PD induced by 6 -hydroxidopamine (6 -OHDA). 6 -OHDA (16 µg/ 2 µ l) was injected into the right medial forebrain bundle (MFB) in MFB-lesioned rat's brain. Sham group received vehicle instead of 6 -OHDA. PD-model was confirmed by rotational test using apomorphine injection. EA (50 mg/kg/ 2 ml, <b>by</b> <b>gavages)</b> was administered in PD+EA group. One group of MFB-lesioned rats received pramipexole (PPX; 2 mg/kg/ 2 ml, <b>by</b> <b>gavages)</b> as a positive control group (PD+PPX group). Motor activity was assessed by stride length, rotarod, and cylinder tests. Pallidal local EEG was recorded in freely moving rats. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) besides Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were measured in both striatum and hippocampus tissues. MFB lesion caused significant reduction of stride-length (P < 0. 001), bar decent latency (P < 0. 001) and frequency bands' power of pallidal EEG (P < 0. 001). Use of 6 -OHDA caused a reduction in the GPx (P < 0. 001) and SOD (P < 0. 001) activities while increased significantly the levels of MDA (P < 0. 001) in MFB-lesioned rats. EA significantly restored all above parameters. The results show that EA can improve the motor impairments and electrophysiological performance in the MFB-lesioned rats via raising the cerebral antioxidant contents. Therefore, EA can protect the brain against free radicals-induced neural damage and may be beneficial in the treatment of PD. </div...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Primary and {{secondary}} drug resistance to imatinib and sunitinib {{in patients with}} gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) {{has led to a}} pressing need for new therapeutic strategies such as drug combinations. Most GISTs are caused by mutations in the KIT receptor, leading to upregulated KIT tyrosine kinase activity. Imatinib and nilotinib directly inhibit the kinase activity of KIT, while RAD 001 (everolimus) inhibits mTOR. We report a preclinical study on drug combinations in a xenograft model of GIST in which effects on tumor dimensions and metabolic activity were assessed by small animal PET imaging. Methods Rag 2 -/-; γcommon -/- male mice were injected s. c. into the right leg with GIST 882. The animals were randomized into 6 groups of 6 animals each for different treatment regimens: No therapy (control), imatinib (150 mg/kg b. i. d.) <b>by</b> oral <b>gavage</b> for 6 days, then once/day for another 7 days, everolimus (10 mg/kg/d.) <b>by</b> oral <b>gavage,</b> everolimus (10 mg/kg/d.) + imatinib (150 mg/kg b. i. d.) <b>by</b> oral <b>gavage</b> for 6 days, then once/day for another 7 days, nilotinib (75 mg/kg/d.) <b>by</b> oral <b>gavage,</b> nilotinib (75 mg/kg/d.) + imatinib (150 mg/kg b. i. d) <b>by</b> oral <b>gavage</b> for 6 days, then once/day for another 7 days. Tumor growth control was evaluated by measuring tumor volume (cm 3). Small animal PET (GE Explore tomography) was used to evaluate tumor metabolism and performed in one animal per group at base-line then after 4 and 13 days of treatment. Results After a median latency time of 31 days, tumors grew in all animals (volume 0, 06 - 0, 15 cm 3) and the treatments began at day 38 after cell injection. Tumor volume control (cm 3) after 13 days of treatment was > 0. 5 for imatinib alone and nilotinib alone, and Conclusions As single agents, all drugs showed an anti-tumor effect in GIST xenografts but everolimus was superior. The everolimus plus imatinib combination appeared to be the most active regimen both in terms of inhibiting tumor growth and tumor metabolism. The integration of everolimus in GIST treatment merits further investigation. </p...|$|R
