40|$|The {{plant cell}} {{wall is a}} {{fundamental}} determinant of cell shape, and therefore plant form. Although the molecular basis of plant morphology is unknown, it most likely involves enzymes capable of modifying different components of the cell wall. One of the major components of the plant cell wall, the polysaccharide xyloglucan, is capable of hydrogen bonding to cellulose microfibrils, potentially acting as a molecular tether between adjacent microfibrils. Therefore, enzymes capable of modifying xyloglucan {{may play a role}} in the development of cell shape and plant form. Xyloglucan endotransglycosylases (XETs) are enzymes capable of cleaving xyloglucan polymers endolytically and transferring one of the newly-generated free ends of the polymer to the free end of another xyloglucan chain. The genome of Arabidopsis thaliana encodes at least sixteen XET and XET- related (XTR) genes. I have sequenced 6 novel XTR genes. Several members of this gene family are differentially regulated by environmental stimuli (such as touch, darkness, and temperature extremes) and the growth-promoting hormones auxin and brassinosteroids. The putative XTR proteins share from 34 to 89 % identity at the amino acid level. Like XETs from other plant species, the XTRs are predicted to encode signal peptides, N-linked glycosylation motifs, several cysteines with the potential to form disulfide bonds, and a conserved motif related to the proposed active site of the Bacillus <b>beta-glucanases.</b> Four of the Arabidopsis XTRs, TCH 4, Meri- 5, EXGT, and XTR 9, were produced using the baculovirus/insect cell expression system. All four recombinant proteins catalyzed the transglycosylation of xyloglucan in vitro, demonstrating that the proteins are XETs. The isozymes were characterized biochemically for differences in Kms, pH optima, temperature optima, glycosylation, glucanase activity, and the ability to utilize different xyloglucan substrates. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis of TCH 4 revealed that the conserved motif shared with Bacillus <b>beta-glucanases</b> encodes at least one amino acid, glutamate 97, essential for XET activity in TCH 4...|$|R

This synergism is therefore explained by an inhibition of the membrane-bound beta- 1, 3 -glucan synthase of the host by the peptaibols, which inhibit the resynthesis of cell wall beta-glucans, sustain the disruptive action of <b>beta-glucanases,</b> and all together enhance the fungicidal activity.

40|$|About 15 % of {{flowering}} plant species synthesize fructans. Fructans serve mainly as reserve carbohydrates and {{are subject to}} breakdown by plant fructan exohydrolases (FEHs), among which 1 -FEHs (inulinases) and 6 -FEHs (levanases) can be differentiated. This paper describes the unexpected finding that 6 -FEHs also occur in plants that do not synthesize fructans. The purification, characterization, cloning and functional analysis of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) 6 -FEH are described. Enzyme activity measurements during sugar beet development suggest a constitutive expression of the gene in sugar beet roots. Classical enzyme purification followed by in-gel trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry (quadruple-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF) MS) led to peptide sequence information used in subsequent RT-PCR based cloning. Levan-type fructans (beta- 2, 6) are the best substrates for the enzyme, while inulin-type fructans (beta- 2, 1) and sucrose are poorly or not degraded. Sugar beet 6 -FEH is more related to cell wall invertases than to vacuolar invertases and has a low iso-electric point (pI), clearly different from typical high pI cell wall invertases. Poor sequence homology to bacterial or fungal FEHs makes an endophytic origin highly unlikely. The functionality of the 6 -FEH cDNA was further demonstrated by heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris. As fructans are absent in sugar beet, the role of 6 -FEH in planta is not obvious. Like chitinases and <b>beta-glucanases</b> hydrolysing cell-surface components of fungal plant pathogens, a straightforward working hypothesis for further research might be that plant 6 -FEHs participate in hydrolysis (or prevent the formation) of levan-containing slime surrounding endophytic or phytopathogenic bacteria. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to display a rumen {{bacterial}} <b>beta-glucanase</b> on the cell surface of a probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri strain. The beta-glucan degrading ability and the adhesion capability of the genetically modified strain were evaluated. The <b>beta-glucanase</b> (Glu) from Fibrobacter succinogenes was fused to the C-terminus of collagen-binding protein (Cnb) from L. reuteri and then expressed by L. reuteri Pg 4 as a recombinant Cnb-Glu-His 6 fusion protein. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometric analysis of the transformed strain L. reuteri pNZ-cnb/glu demonstrated that Cnb-Glu-His(6) fusion protein was displayed on As cell surface. In addition, L. reuteri pNZ-cnb/glu acquired the capacity to break down barley beta-glucan and showed higher adhesion capability, in comparison with the parental strain L. reuteri Pg 4. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of successful display of fibrolytic enzymes on the cell surface of intestinal lactobacilli...|$|E
40|$|The DNA {{sequence}} of a mixed-linkage <b>beta-glucanase</b> (1, 3 - 1, 4 -beta-D-glucan 4 -glucanohydrolase [EC 3. 2. 1. 73]) gene from Fibrobacter succinogenes cloned in Escherichia coli was determined. The general {{features of this}} gene {{are very similar to}} the consensus features for other gram-negative bacterial genes. The gene product was processed for export in E. coli. There is a high level of sequence homology between the structure of this glucanase and the structure of a mixed-linkage <b>beta-glucanase</b> from Bacillus subtilis. The nonhomologous region of the amino acid sequence includes a serine-rich region containing five repeats of the sequence Pro-Xxx-Ser-Ser-Ser-Ser-(Ala or Val) which may be functionally related to the serine-rich region observed in Pseudomonas fluorescens cellulase and the serine- and/or threonine-rich regions observed in Cellulomonas fimi endoglucanase and exoglucanase, in Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanases A and B, and in Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase I, cellobiohydrolase II, and endoglucanase I...|$|E
40|$|Paddy rice {{is rarely}} {{used as a}} feed because of its high fiber content. In this study, two {{experiments}} were conducted to {{study the effects of}} supplementing an enzyme complex consisting of xylanase, <b>beta-glucanase</b> and cellulase, to paddy-based diets on the performance and nutrient digestibility in meat-type ducks. In the both experiments, meat-type ducks (Cherry Valley) were randomly assigned to four treatments. Treatment 1 was a basal diet of corn-soybean; treatment 2 was a basal diet of corn-paddy-soybean; treatment 3, had enzyme complex added to the corn-paddy-soybean basal diet at levels of 0. 5 g/kg diet; and treatment 4, had enzyme complex added to the corn-paddy-soybean diet at levels of 1. 0 g/kg diet. The results showed that the enzyme complex increased the ADG, and decreased the ADFI and F/G significantly (p 0. 05). The outcome of this research indicates that the application of enzyme complex made up of xylanase, <b>beta-glucanase,</b> and cellulase, in the corn-paddy-soybean diet, can improve performance and nutrition digestibility in meat-type ducks...|$|E
40|$|TCH 4 encodes a xyloglucan endotransglycosylase (XET) of Arabidopsis thaliana. XETs endolytically cleave and religate xyloglucan polymers; xyloglucan {{is one of}} {{the primary}} {{structural}} components of the plant cell wall. Therefore, XET function may affect cell shape and plant morphogenesis. To gain insight into the biochemical function of TCH 4, we defined structural requirements for optimal XET activity. Recombinant baculoviruses were designed to produce distinct forms of TCH 4. TCH 4 protein engineered to be synthesized in the cytosol and thus lack normal co- and post-translational modifications is virtually inactive. TCH 4 proteins, with and without a polyhistidine tag, that harbor an intact N-terminus are directed to the secretory pathway. Thus, as predicted, the N-terminal region of TCH 4 functions as a signal peptide. TCH 4 is shown to have at least one disulfide bond as monitored by a mobility shift in SDS-PAGE in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT). This disulfide bond(s) is essential for full XET activity. TCH 4 is glycosylated in vivo; glycosidases that remove N-linked glycosylation eliminated 98 % of the XET activity. Thus, co- and/or post-translational modifications are critical for optimal TCH 4 XET activity. Furthermore, using site-specific mutagenesis, we demonstrated that the first glutamate residue of the conserved DEIDFEFL motif (E 97) is essential for activity. A change to glutamine at this position resulted in an inactive protein; a change to aspartic acid caused protein mislocalization. These data support the hypothesis that, in analogy to Bacillus <b>beta-glucanases,</b> this region may be the active site of XET enzymes...|$|R
40|$|Enzymes {{capable of}} hydrolyzing cell walls of Blastomyces dermatitidis and chemotypes I and II of Histoplasma capsulatum were {{prepared}} {{in the laboratory}} or obtained from commercial sources. They included chitinases, beta- 1, 3 -glucanases, beta- 1, 6 -glucanase, and Pronase. Monosaccharides and disaccharides of glucose released from the cell walls by the enzymes were determined qualitatively by paper and gas-liquid chromatography, and monosaccharides were quantitated by the latter technique as well. An enzyme system isolated from Streptomyces sp. containing both chitinase and glucanase released maximum amounts of glucose and N-acetylglucosamine from the cell walls of H. capsulatum chemotype I. A chitinase preparation, free of glucanase, from Serratia marcescens released only chitobiose and N-acetylglucosamine from chemotype I cell walls, but the total quantity of N-acetylglucosamine released was about 60 % less than that released by the Streptomyces system. A beta- 1, 3 -glucanase from Bacillus circulans hydrolyzed the cell walls of H. capsulatum chemotype I, but a beta- 1, 6 -glucanase failed to release glucose from the same walls. Autolytic enzymes, viz., beta- 1, 3 -glucanases and several glycosidases were detected as constitutive enzymes in both yeast and mycelial phases of B. dermatitidis and H. capsulatum chemotypes I and II. No difference {{in the amount of}} activity was found between cell sap and culture filtrate preparations. The <b>beta-glucanases</b> prepared from the Histoplasma and Blastomyces strains were active on the cell walls of the yeast phases of H. capsulatum chemotypes I and II, releasing laminaribiose and glucose, but were essentially inactive on the cell walls of B. dermatitidis. Chitinase, beta- 1, 6 -glucanase, alpha-glucanase, and alpha-glucosidase activities were absent from these fungal enzyme preparations...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Diatoms are {{unicellular}} algae {{responsible for}} approximately 20 % of global carbon fixation. Their evolution by secondary endocytobiosis {{resulted in a}} complex cellular structure and metabolism compared to algae with primary plastids. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The whole genome sequence of the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum has recently been completed. We identified and annotated genes for enzymes involved in carbohydrate pathways based on extensive EST support and comparison to the whole genome sequence of a second diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana. Protein localization to mitochondria was predicted based on identified similarities to mitochondrial localization motifs in other eukaryotes, whereas protein localization to plastids {{was based on the}} presence of signal peptide motifs in combination with plastid localization motifs previously shown to be required in diatoms. We identified genes potentially involved in a C 4 -like photosynthesis in P. tricornutum and, on the basis of sequence-based putative localization of relevant proteins, discuss possible differences in carbon concentrating mechanisms and CO(2) fixation between the two diatoms. We also identified genes encoding enzymes involved in photorespiration with one interesting exception: glycerate kinase was not found in either P. tricornutum or T. pseudonana. Various Calvin cycle enzymes were found in up to five different isoforms, distributed between plastids, mitochondria and the cytosol. Diatoms store energy either as lipids or as chrysolaminaran (a beta- 1, 3 -glucan) outside of the plastids. We identified various <b>beta-glucanases</b> and large membrane-bound glucan synthases. Interestingly most of the glucanases appear to contain C-terminal anchor domains that may attach the enzymes to membranes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Here we present a detailed synthesis of carbohydrate metabolism in diatoms based on the genome sequences of Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum. This model provides novel insights into acquisition of dissolved inorganic carbon and primary metabolic pathways of carbon in two different diatoms, which is of significance for an improved understanding of global carbon cycles...|$|R
