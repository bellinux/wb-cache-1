25|$|Rhamnolipids {{have long}} been {{reported}} to have antimicrobial properties. They {{have been shown to}} have activity against a range of bacteria including Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 0.5µg/mL to 32µg/mL. Activity against several fungi such as Fusarium solani and Penicillium funiculosum have also been observed with MICs of 75µg/mL and 16µg/mL respectively. Rhamnolipids have been suggested as antimicrobials able to remove <b>Bordetella</b> <b>bronchiseptica</b> biofilms. The mode of killing has been shown to result from intercalation of rhamnolipids into the cell membrane causing pores to form which result in cell lysis, at least in the case of Bacillus subtilis. The anti-microbial action of rhamnolipids may provide a fitness advantage for Pseudomonas aeruginosa by excluding other microorganisms from the colonised niche. Furthermore, rhamnolipids have been shown to have anti-viral and zoosporicidal activities. The antimicrobial properties of rhamnolipids may confer a fitness advantage for Pseudomonas aeruginosa in niche colonisation as Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a soil bacterium, as well as competing with other bacteria in the cystic fibrosis lung.|$|E
40|$|Arylmalonate-Decarboxylases (AMDases, EC 4. 1. 1. 76) {{are very}} rare and mostly underexplored enzymes. Currently only four known and biochemically {{characterized}} representatives exist. However, {{their ability to}} decarboxylate α-disubstituted malonic acid derivatives to optically pure products without cofactors makes them attractive and promising candidates for the use as biocatalysts in industrial processes. Until now, AMDases could {{not be separated from}} other members of the aspartate/glutamate racemase superfamily based on their gene sequences. Within this work, a search algorithm was developed that enables a reliable prediction of AMDase activity for potential candidates. Based on specific sequence patterns and screening methods 58 novel AMDase candidate genes could be identified in this work. Thereby, AMDases with the conserved sequence pattern of <b>Bordetella</b> <b>bronchiseptica’s</b> prototype appeared to be limited to the classes of Alpha-, Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria. Amino acid homologies and comparison of gene surrounding sequences enabled the classification of eight enzyme clusters. Particularly striking is the accumulation of genes coding for different transporters of the TTT family, TRAP transporters and ABC transporters as well as genes coding for mandelate racemases/muconate lactonizing enzymes that might be involved in substrate uptake or degradation of AMDase products. Further, three novel AMDases were characterized which showed a high enantiomeric excess (> 99 %) of the (R) -enantiomer of flurbiprofen. These are the recombinant AmdA and AmdV from Variovorax sp. strains HH 01 and HH 02, originated from soil, and AmdP from Polymorphum gilvum found by a data base search. Altogether our findings give new insights into the class of AMDases and reveal many previously unknown enzyme candidates with high potential for bioindustrial processes...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bordetella</b> (B) <b>bronchiseptica</b> is {{a common}} {{veterinary}} pathogen, but has rarely been implicated in human infections. Most patients with B. bronchiseptica infections are compromised clinically such as in patients with a malignancy, AIDS, malnutrition, or chronic renal failure. We experienced a case of relapsing peritonitis caused by B. bronchiseptica associated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). A 56 -yr-old male, treated with CAPD due to end stage renal disease (ESRD), was admitted with complaints of abdominal pain and a turbid peritoneal dialysate. The culture of peritoneal dialysate identified B. bronchiseptica. The patient was treated {{with a combination of}} intraperitoneal antibiotics.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} study was to detect selected pathogens in pneumonic lung tissue of dogs of different age groups by immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridisation (ISH) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) {{in order to get}} information about their involvement in pneumonia formation. In archived formalin-fixed and paraffin wax-embedded lung samples from 68 cases with the clinical and histologic diagnosis of pneumonia the histological pattern of pneumonia was re-evaluated and the samples were further investigated for the following infectious agents: canine distemper virus (CDV), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV- 2), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), <b>Bordetella</b> (B.) <b>bronchiseptica,</b> Pasteurella (P.) multocida, Mycoplasma spp., and Pneumocystis spp. In 47. 1 % of the samples {{at least one of the}} featured respiratory pathogens was detected. In 31. 3 % of these positive samples more than one pathogen could be found. The correct detection of CDV had been achieved in ten out of eleven positive cases (90. 9 %) upon initial investigation, but the presence of bacterial pathogens, like B. bronchiseptica (10 cases) and P. multocida (17 cases) had been missed in all but one case. While CDV and CRCoV infections were exclusively found in dogs younger than one year, the vast majority of infections with P. multocida and B. bronchiseptica were both common either in dogs younger than 4 months or older than one year. Thus, this retrospective approach yielded valuable data on the presence, absence and prevalence of certain respiratory pathogens in dogs with pneumonia...|$|R

40|$|The {{degree of}} genetic {{diversity}} in 45 <b>Bordetella</b> (B.) <b>bronchiseptica</b> strains comprised of a vaccine strain (N = 1), reference strains (N = 3) and field isolates (N = 41) was evaluated using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting and {{pulsed-field gel electrophoresis}} (PFGE). Three candidate primers were selected for RAPD analysis after screening 20 random decamer oligonucleotides for their discriminatory abilities. The OPA- 07, OPA- 08 and OPA- 18 primers yielded 10, 10, and 6 distinct fingerprint patterns, respectively. The most common identical RAPD pattern was produced by OPA- 07 which was shared by 32 isolates (71. 1 %), the pattern produced by OPA- 08 was shared by 26 isolates (57. 8 %), and the pattern produced by OPA- 18 was shared by 40 isolates (88. 9 %). The RAPD patterns of the vaccine strain and the 3 reference strains did not match any of the patterns produced by the field isolates when primers OPA- 07 and OPA- 08 were used. PFGE using the restriction endonuclease XbaI produced a total of 15 patterns consisting of 4 PFGE types (A, B, B 1 and C, differing by ≥ 4 bands) and 11 A subtypes (differing by ≤ 3 bands). Most of the field isolates exhibited identical type A and B patterns, suggesting that they were related.

One reference and one type strain plus two field isolates of B. bronchiseptica were chosen to analyse growth curves in four different media: cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth (CAMHB) with and without 2 % lysed horse blood, Brain-Heart-Infusion (BHI), and Caso broth. The growth rate of each test strain in each medium was determined by culture enumeration and the suitability of CAMHB was confirmed by comparative statistical analysis. Thereafter, reference and type strain and eight epidemiologically unrelated field isolates of B. bronchiseptica were {{used to test the}} suitability of a broth microdilution susceptibility testing method following CLSI-approved performance standards given in document VET 01 -A 4. Susceptibility tests, using 20 antimicrobial agents, were performed in five replicates, and data were collected after 20 and 24 hours incubation and statistically analysed. Due to the low growth rate of B. bronchiseptica, an incubation time of 24 hours resulted in significantly more homogeneous minimum inhibitory concentrations after five replications compared to a 20 -hour incubation. An interlaboratory comparison trial including susceptibility testing of 24 antimicrobial agents revealed a high mean level of reproducibility (97. 9 %) of the modified method. Hence, in a harmonization for broth microdilution susceptibility testing of B. bronchiseptica, an incubation time of 24 hours in CAMHB medium with an incubation temperature of 35 °C and an inoculum concentration of approximately 5 x 10 (5) cfu/ml was proposed...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} <b>Bordetella</b> pertussis, B. <b>bronchiseptica,</b> and B. parapertussis genome assemblies permitted the identification of regions with significant sequence divergence and the design of two new real-time PCR assays, BP 283 and BP 485, for the specific detection of B. pertussis. The performance characteristics of these two assays were evaluated and compared to those of culture and an existing real-time PCR assay targeting the repetitive element IS 481. The testing of 324 nasopharyngeal specimens indicated that, compared to culture, the BP 283 assay had a sensitivity and specificity of 100 and 96. 8 % and the BP 485 assay had a sensitivity and specificity of 92. 3 and 97. 1 %. Notably, B. holmesii was isolated from two specimens that were positive by the IS 481 assay but negative by the BP 283 and BP 485 assays.

40|$|Resistance {{profiles}} of the two <b>Bordetella</b> species B. <b>bronchiseptica</b> and B. pertussis against various antimicrobial peptides were determined in liquid survival and agar diffusion assays. B. bronchiseptica exhibited significantly higher resistance against all tested peptides than B. pertussis. The most powerful agents acting on B. bronchiseptica were, {{in the order of}} their killing efficiencies, cecropin P > cecropin B > magainin-II-amide > protamine > melittin. Interestingly, for B. bronchiseptica, the resistance level was significantly affected by phase variation, as a bvgS deletion derivative showed an increased sensitivity to these peptides. Tn 5 -induced protamine-sensitive B. bronchiseptica mutants, which were found to be very susceptible to most of the cationic peptides, were isolated. In two of these mutants, the genetic loci inactivated by transposon insertion were identified as containing genes highly homologous to the wlbA and wlbL genes of B. pertussis that are involved in the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In agreement with this finding, the two peptide-sensitive mutants revealed structural changes in the LPS, resulting in the loss of the O-specific side chains and the prevalence of the LPS core structure. This demonstrates that LPS {{plays a major role in}} the resistance of B. bronchiseptica against the action of antimicrobial peptides and suggests that B. pertussis is much more susceptible to these peptides due to the lack of the highly charged O-specific sugar side chains...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bordetella</b> pertussis, B. <b>bronchiseptica,</b> B. parapertussis(hu), and B. parapertussis(ov) {{are closely}} related {{respiratory}} pathogens that infect mammalian species. B. pertussis and B. parapertussis(hu) are exclusively human pathogens and cause whooping cough, or pertussis, a disease that has resurged despite vaccination. Although it most often infects animals, infrequently B. bronchiseptica is isolated from humans, and these infections {{are thought to be}} zoonotic. B. pertussis and B. parapertussis(hu) are assumed to have evolved from a B. bronchiseptica-like ancestor independently. To determine the phylogenetic relationships among these species, housekeeping and virulence genes were sequenced, comparative genomic hybridizations were performed using DNA microarrays, and the distribution of insertion sequence elements was determined, using a collection of 132 strains. This multifaceted approach distinguished four complexes, representing B. pertussis, B. parapertussis(hu), and two distinct B. bronchiseptica subpopulations, designated complexes I and IV. Of the two B. bronchiseptica complexes, complex IV was more closely related to B. pertussis. Of interest, while only 32 % of the complex I strains were isolated from humans, 80 % of the complex IV strains were human isolates. Comparative genomic hybridization analysis identified the absence of the pertussis toxin locus and dermonecrotic toxin gene, as well as a polymorphic lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis locus, as associated with adaptation of complex IV strains to the human host. Lipopolysaccharide structural diversity among these strains was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. Thus, complex IV strains may comprise a human-associated lineage of B. bronchiseptica from which B. pertussis evolved. These findings will facilitate the study of pathogen host-adaptation. Our results shed light on the origins of the disease pertussis and suggest that the association of B. pertussis with humans may be more ancient than previously assumed...|$|R
40|$|A {{real-time}} PCR assay {{with improved}} specificity for detection and discrimination of all clinically relevant Bordetella species {{by the presence}} and distribution of three Insertion Sequence elements Lieuwe Roorda 1, Johannes Buitenwerf 1, Jacobus M Ossewaarde 1, 2, Anneke van der Zee 1 * Background: In Dutch laboratories molecular detection of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis is commonly based on insertion sequences IS 481 and IS 1001, respectively. Both IS elements are more widely spread among Bordetella species. Both <b>Bordetella</b> holmesii, andB. <b>bronchiseptica</b> can harbour IS 481. Also, IS 1001 is found among B. bronchiseptica. IS 481, and IS 1001 based PCR thus lacks specificity when used for detection of specific Bordetella spp. Findings: We designed a PCR based on IS 1002, another IS element that is present among Bordetella species, and exploited it as a template in combination with PCR for IS 481, and IS 1001. In combining the PCRs for IS 481, IS 1001, and IS 1002, and including an inhibition control, {{we were able to}} detect and discriminate all clinically relevant Bordetella species. Conclusions: We developed an improved PCR method for specific detection of B. pertussis, B. parapertussis, B. holmesii, and B. bronchiseptica. Background The genus Bordetella is comprised of 8 species, 4 of which are known to infect humans; B. pertussis, B. parapertussis, B. holmesii, and B. bronchiseptica. The most important cause for whooping cough is B. pertussis, followedby B. parapertussis. Bordetella holmesii was first described in 1995 [1], and has since been isolated from patients with a serious underlying disease [2 - 5]. B. bronchiseptica is usually restricted to animals but occasionally is isolated from immunocompromised patients [6, 7]. A large number of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assays have been described for detection of Bordetella pertussis and B. parapertussis, and more recently B. holmesii [8 - 14]. Most PCRs are based on detection of the insertion sequence elements IS 481, and IS 1001, because they exist in multiple copies in the chromosome. A hig...|$|R

To put the relative levels of shedding bacteria into perspective, a study analyzing the shedding kinetics of B. bronchiseptica presents the highest levels of bacterial shedding one week post-exposure, with an order of magnitude decrease in shedding observed every week. [...] This projection places negligible levels of shedding to be expected 6 weeks post-exposure (or ~5 weeks post-onset of symptoms).
