A white farmer promised freedom {{and a piece}} of <b>Bottom</b> <b>land</b> to his slave if he would perform some very difficult chores. When the slave completed the work, he asked the farmer to keep his end of the bargain. Freedom was easy, the farmer had no objection to that, but he didn't want to give up any land, so he told the slave that he was very sorry that he had to give him valley land. He had hoped to give him a piece of the <b>bottom</b> <b>land.</b> The slave blinked and said he thought valley <b>land</b> was <b>bottom</b> <b>land.</b> The master said, [...] "Oh no!

50|$|The truss is {{the hollow}} metal {{structure}} that bridges the lower and upper landings, {{composed of two}} side sections joined together with cross braces across the bottom and just below the top.

50|$|The {{track system}} {{is built into}} the truss to guide the step chain, which {{continuously}} pulls the steps from the bottom platform and back to the top in an endless loop. One track guides the front wheels of the steps (called the step-wheel track) and another guides the back wheels of the steps (called the trailer-wheel track). The relative positions of these tracks cause the steps to form a staircase as they move out from under the comb plate. Along the straight section of the truss the tracks are at their maximum distance apart. This configuration forces the back of one step to be at a 90-degree angle relative to the step behind it. This right angle forces the steps into a shape resembling a staircase. At {{the top and bottom of}} the escalator, the two tracks converge so that the front and back wheels of the steps are almost in a straight line. This causes the stairs to lay in a flat sheetlike arrangement, one after another, so they can easily travel around the bend in the curved section of track. The tracks carry the steps down along the underside of the truss until they reach the <b>bottom</b> <b>landing,</b> where they pass through another curved section of track before exiting the <b>bottom</b> <b>landing.</b> At this point, the tracks separate and the steps once again assume a staircase configuration. This cycle is repeated continually as the steps are pulled from bottom to top and back to the bottom again.|$|E
50|$|Aletopelta {{is known}} {{from a single}} partial {{skeleton}} lacking the skull, holotype SDNHM 33909, part of {{the collection of the}} San Diego Natural History Museum, San Diego, California. The skeleton including femora (the thighbones), tibiae (shinbones), fibulae (calf bones) and incomplete parts of a scapula (shoulder blade), humerus, ulna, left and right ischium, vertebrae, ribs, partial armor over the pelvic girdle, a cervival halfring plus at least sixty detached armor plates and eight teeth was found in a layer of the Late Cretaceous (Upper Campanian) marine Point Loma Formation, dating from the late Campanian, in 2001 estimated at 75.5 million years old. Apparently, the animal's bloated carcass floated out to sea, and formed a miniature reef environment after it sunk to the <b>bottom,</b> <b>landing</b> on its back, as testified by Pelecypoda attaching to the bones. The remains were scavenged by sharks. Most long bones have lost their joint surfaces and were hollowed out. As a result the condition of the skeletal elements is poor.|$|E
5000|$|Columns {{was one of}} {{the many}} SameGame/Tetris-like tile-matching puzzle games to appear after its great success in the late 1980s. The area of play is {{enclosed}} within a tall, rectangular playing area. Columns of three different symbols (such as differently-colored jewels) appear, one at a time, {{at the top of the}} well and fall to the <b>bottom,</b> <b>landing</b> either on the floor or on top of previously-fallen [...] "columns". While a column is falling, the player can move it left and right, and can also cycle the positions of the symbols within it. After a column lands, if three or more of the same symbols are connected in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line, those symbols disappear. The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this resettlement causes three or more other symbols to align, they too disappear and the cycle repeats. Occasionally, a special column with a multicolor Magic Jewel appears. It destroys all the jewels with the same color as the one underneath it. The columns fall at a faster rate as the player progresses. The goal of the game is to play for as long as possible before the well fills up with jewels, which ends the game. Players can score up to 99,999 points.|$|E

40|$|Lateral {{vibrations}} of {{the suspension}} and compensating ropes in a high-rise elevator system are {{induced by the}} building motions. When the elevator is in motion {{the length of the}} ropes change so that the natural frequencies vary, rendering the dynamics of the system nonstationary. In this scenario large displacements of the ropes occur when a passage through resonance takes place. Due to the nonlinear coupling, interactions between the in-plane and out of plane directions occur. Furthermore, the car, counterweight and compensating sheave suffer from vertical vibrations due to the coupling with lateral vibrations of the ropes. This paper presents a comprehensive mathematical model of a high-rise elevator system which can predict the dynamic interactions taking place during its operation. A case study when the car is stationary at the top landing level corresponding to the resonance length of the ropes and starts to move downward to the <b>bottom</b> <b>landing</b> level will be discussed. The model is implemented in the MATLAB computational environment and the dynamic response of the system when the building is subjected to a low frequency sway, is determined through numerical simulation with the car following the kinematic profile dictated by the drive control algorithm. The results predict a range of nonlinear dynamic interactions between the components of the elevator system, during travel...|$|E
40|$|The {{works were}} carried out {{with the help of}} ground {{penetrating}} radar “Grot- 10 ”. Doublet broadband antennas with the central frequency of 100 MHz were used. Georadar measures the speed of EM waves v in ice-saturated soil and then the value ε′ is calculated. The radargrams received as a result of georadar survey, which represents stacked data (the two-way time is indicated on vertical scale), were transformed into depth sections, which reflect the space structure located below ground. The distance between the <b>bottom</b> <b>landing</b> and buried mountain road near the north tunnel portal is 78, 5 m (profile # 1), and the distance from the upper landing is 84, 5 m (profile no. 2). Later, in the April 2003 during the hole boring with the diameter 1, 2 m the vertical distance between the upper landing, where ground penetrating works {{were carried out}}, and the carpet road of the tunnel was calculated. This distance appeared to be 83 m, that means, the discrepancy between boring and georadar data (84, 5 m) was only 1, 5 m. Thus, the results of ground penetrating investigations helped the workers of glacier to make the correct conclusion on time about the location and burial depth of the tunnel...|$|E
