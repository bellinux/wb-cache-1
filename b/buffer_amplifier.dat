50|$|A voltage <b>buffer</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{is used to}} {{transfer}} a voltage from a first circuit, having a high output impedance level, to a second circuit with a low input impedance level. The interposed <b>buffer</b> <b>amplifier</b> prevents the second circuit from loading the first circuit unacceptably and interfering with its desired operation. In the ideal voltage buffer in the diagram, the input resistance is infinite, the output resistance zero (output impedance of an ideal voltage source is zero).

50|$|Simple {{unity gain}} buffer {{amplifiers}} include the {{bipolar junction transistor}} in common-base configuration, or the MOSFET in common-gate configuration (called a current follower because the output current follows the input current). The current gain of a current <b>buffer</b> <b>amplifier</b> is (approximately) unity.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{sample and}} hold circuit stores {{electric}} charge in a capacitor and contains at least one switching device such as a FET (field effect transistor) switch and normally one operational amplifier. To sample the input signal the switch connects the capacitor to the output of a <b>buffer</b> <b>amplifier.</b> The <b>buffer</b> <b>amplifier</b> charges or discharges the capacitor so that the voltage across the capacitor is practically equal, or proportional to, input voltage. In hold mode the switch disconnects the capacitor from the buffer. The capacitor is invariably discharged by its own leakage currents and useful load currents, which makes the circuit inherently volatile, but the loss of voltage (voltage drop) within a specified hold time remains within an acceptable error margin.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{its high}} input {{impedance}} and easily selectable gain, an operational amplifier in a conventional non-inverting configuration is often used in VCVS implementations. Implementations of Sallen-Key filters often use an operational amplifier configured as a voltage follower; however, emitter or source followers are other common choices for the <b>buffer</b> <b>amplifier.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a high output {{performance}} of a Ka-band monolithic HEMT Voltage Controlled Oscillator(VCO). This VCO has a sub-resonator {{in order to avoid}} reduction in Q-factor of a resonator. Circuit elements of the sub-resonator are optimized to achieve a wide tuning range as well as high output power and low phase noise performances. In addition, an AlGaAs/InGaAs double-hetero struc­ture High Electron Mobility Transistor(HEMT) is employed in the VCO to obtain a high output per­formance. A high output power of 19. 4 dBm has been achieved at an oscillation frequency of 36. 2 GHz. This performance has been achieved without any <b>buffer</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> A tuning range of more than 2. 5 GHz is also obtained with a stable high output power. To our knowledge, this represents the high­est output power of monolithic VCO without any <b>buffer</b> <b>amplifiers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a current differencing <b>buffered</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{as an active}} element for analog signal processing which support, in comparison to conventional operational amplifier not only the voltagemode but also the current-and mixed-mode operations. In this paper a second order multi-mode notch filter is proposed. The same circuit {{can be used as}} multi-mode allpass filter by changing the values of resistance and capacitance. The main feature of this configuration is that, it can be used in Current Mode (CM), Voltage Mode (VM), Transimpedance Mode (TIM) and Transadmittance Mode (TAM) without changing the configuration. This filter uses a single Current Differencing <b>Buffered</b> <b>Amplifier</b> (CDBA) and a total of five/six passive components. The results from PSPICE simulation are in remarkable agreement with theoretical one.

50|$|A <b>buffer</b> <b>amplifier</b> (sometimes simply {{called a}} buffer) {{is one that}} {{provides}} electrical impedance transformation from one circuit to another, {{with the aim of}} preventing the signal source from being affected by whatever currents (or voltages, for a current buffer) that the load may produce. The signal is 'buffered from' load currents. Two main types of buffer exist: the voltage buffer and the current buffer.|$|E

50|$|A second {{improvement}} is {{the integration of}} an optional-use output <b>buffer</b> <b>amplifier</b> to the chip on which the OTA resides. This is actually a convenience to a circuit designer rather than an improvement to the OTA itself; dispensing {{with the need to}} employ a separate buffer. It also allows the OTA {{to be used as a}} traditional op-amp, if desired, by converting its output current to a voltage.|$|E
50|$|If {{the voltage}} is {{transferred}} unchanged (the voltage gain Av is 1), the amplifier is a unity gain buffer; {{also known as}} a voltage follower because the output voltage follows or tracks the input voltage. Although the voltage gain of a voltage <b>buffer</b> <b>amplifier</b> may be (approximately) unity, it usually provides considerable current gain and thus power gain. However, it is commonplace to say that it has a gain of 1 (or the equivalent 0 dB), referring to the voltage gain.|$|E
50|$|A {{non-linear}} <b>buffer</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{is sometimes}} used in digital circuits where a high current is required, perhaps for driving more gates than the normal fan-out of the logic family used, or for driving displays, or long wires, or other difficult loads. It {{is common for}} a single package to contain several discrete buffer amplifiers. For example, a hex buffer is a single package containing 6 discrete buffer amplifiers, and an octal buffer is a single package containing 8 discrete buffer amplifiers. The terms inverting buffer and non-inverting buffer effectively correspond with high-current capability single-input NOR or OR gates respectively.|$|E
