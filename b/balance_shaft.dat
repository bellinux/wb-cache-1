25|$|The first models, known generically as the T300s, {{all used}} a common piston {{diameter}} (76mm) {{in a common}} wet cylinder liner. Basic engine variations were achieved {{through the use of}} two specifications of piston stroke: 65mm to create individual cylinder capacity of 300cc, and 55mm to create a 250cc individual cylinder. Two 750cc models were released – and the Daytona and Trident 750 triples (3 x 250cc). There was one 1000cc model – the Daytona 1000 four (4 x 250cc). Two 900cc models were the Trophy 900 and Trident 900 triples (3 x 300cc). The Trophy 1200 four was the largest model (4 x 300cc). All were remarkably smooth running. The three cylinder models were equipped with a contra-rotating <b>balance</b> <b>shaft</b> mounted {{at the front of the}} engine. The four cylinder models benefitted from twin balance shafts – unique at the time – mounted beneath the crank shaft. Contemporary road tests noted the solidity and smoothness of performance as positives but the weight of the machines as negatives. For brand new machines produced by a totally new concern, there were remarkably few early problems. These were an insecure oil pressure switch and a longer-lived problem with the starter (or sprag clutch). The cosmetic finish on the first machines was simple and not very robust. Revisions to crankcases for the three-cylinder models in 1993, together with a move to high pressure casting, reduced engine weight considerably. All painting and plating operations were brought in house in 1993, as the Hinckley factory benefitted from further investment after the initial success of the range. The result was improved quality and durability of finish, added to the basic engineering integrity of the engine and chassis, made for a long-lasting and robust motorcycle.|$|E

2500|$|Laverda {{launched}} a smaller 500cc twin cylinder eight-valve entry-level machine named the Alpina in 1977 (quickly renamed Alpino due to trademark infringement and Zeta in the USA). It {{came with a}} six-speed gearbox and <b>balance</b> <b>shaft.</b> A 350cc version of the Alpino was also available from November 1977 [...] primarily designed for the home Italian market where a high tax was payable for machines over 350cc. [...] This {{was followed by the}} improved Alpino S and Formula 500 racer in 1978, to support a single model race series. [...] Its import into the UK led Roger Slater to develop the Montjuic in 1979 which was a road legal F500 with lights, sidestand & instruments. It evolved into the mk2 in 1981.

2500|$|Of all {{cylinder}} layouts without <b>balance</b> <b>shaft</b> {{a straight}} eight design has very low inherent vibration, while the side-valve layout contains {{the moving parts}} of the valve train within the cast-iron block, enabling it to be very quiet compared to an overhead valve configuration (as in the contemporary Buick engines). Combined with a substantial exhaust manifold and effective intake and exhaust muffling {{this can lead to}} a very quiet vehicle, both internally and externally. At the time of its use a quiet engine was thought to be a mark of quality in an automobile. Bores need be of small diameter to keep the engine length down and so strokes must be long to obtain larger displacements - such configurations (called [...] "undersquare") exhibit good low-rpm torque and are capable of slow idle speeds, enhancing both drivability and quietness. While Chrysler vehicles had similar engines they were not targeted for the lower middle price range enabled by General Motors' manufacturing expertise and volumes of the time.|$|E
2500|$|The 1988 Fiero {{brought a}} new {{suspension}} design, thought by many to have {{a striking resemblance to}} those designed by Lotus, which at the time, was about to be acquired by General Motors. The suspension was never a Lotus design though; it was the suspension the Pontiac engineers had designed in the beginning, along with what they learned from the racing program. Up front were revised control arms and knuckles that reduced steering effort and improved the scrub radius. In the back, the old Citation parts were replaced with a real tri-link suspension with all new knuckles. This new suspension came with staggered wheel sizes on WS6 suspension equipped models, with [...] by [...] wide wheels up front and [...] by [...] wide wheels in the rear for improved handling balance and to offset the slightly increased front track that resulted from the improvements. Topping off the package were the new vented disc brakes at all four corners, which addressed braking complaints of road testers. A variable effort electro-hydraulic power steering unit, the same design later found on the GM EV1, was also to be a late addition. This option never made it to production — one reason cited is that models with the prototype power steering were noted as being too loud. The four-cylinder engine received an in-pan oil filter element and <b>balance</b> <b>shaft.</b> A [...] "Formula" [...] option was added, which offered many of the GT features with the standard coupe body, including the [...] speedometer, WS6 Suspension (which includes offset crosslace wheels) and the rear spoiler. 1988 marked the end of production for the Fiero, and is also considered to be the best Fiero produced. Improvements to suspension, brakes, steering, and improvements to both the four-cylinder and V6 engines took the car to a level far beyond the 1984 model that had received much criticism. 1988 was also the only year a yellow exterior color was available as a factory option. During the Fiero's final model year (on August 16, 1988) the last window sticker was placed on the last Fiero to roll off the Pontiac, Michigan plant line. The 1988 Fiero is the most desired by automotive collectors because of the improvements made to the 1988 model year, and this being the last year of production. The 1988 Mera seen as the most sought after model and tops the Fiero list in resale value this model is commonly used to create [...] "kit cars" [...] (replicas of high end sports cars).|$|E

50|$|The V10 is {{essentially}} the result of mating two even-firing straight-5 engines together. The straight-5 engine shows first and second order rocking motion. Here it should be assumed that the crankshaft with low second-order vibration is used and the first order is balanced by a <b>balance</b> <b>shaft.</b> By mating the straight-5 banks at 90 degrees and using five throws, the balance shafts balance each other and become null. The firing sequence is odd (BMW S85, Dodge Viper, Volkswagen Touareg). Using an 18° split journal crankshaft the firing order can be made even, and the two balanced shafts do not balance each other completely, but are combined into a single very small <b>balance</b> <b>shaft</b> (Lamborghini V10, Porsche Carrera GT). Using a five-throw crankshaft and 72° bank angle the firing order can be made even, and the two balanced shafts do not balance each other completely, but are combined into a single small <b>balance</b> <b>shaft</b> (Toyota 1LR-GUE engine). A 36° degree bank angle and a 108° flying arm crankshaft would allow even firing without a <b>balance</b> <b>shaft</b> and smaller counterweights, but would be impractical.|$|E

50|$|More modern 90° V6 engine designs {{avoid these}} {{vibration}} problems by using more sophisticated crankshafts with split crankpins offset by 30° between piston pairs {{to make the}} firing intervals an even 120°. They often add <b>balancing</b> <b>shafts</b> to eliminate the other vibration problems inherent in the layout. Examples include the later versions of the Buick V6, Chevrolet Vortec 4300, and earlier versions of the Mercedes-Benz V6. The 90° Mercedes V6, although {{it was designed to}} be built on the same assembly lines as the V8, used split crankpins, a counter-rotating <b>balancing</b> <b>shaft,</b> and careful acoustic design to make it almost as smooth as the inline-6 it replaced. However, in later versions Mercedes changed the cylinder banks to a 60° angle to make the engine more compact and eliminate the <b>balancing</b> <b>shaft.</b> Despite the difference in V angles, Mercedes modified its production lines so it could build 60° V6s on the same assembly lines as 90° V8s.|$|R
50|$|There is {{some debate}} {{as to how}} much power the twin <b>balance</b> <b>shafts</b> cost the engine. The basic figure given is usually around 15 hp (11 kW), but this may be {{excessive}} for pure friction losses. It is possible that this is a miscalculation derived from the common use of an inertial dynamometer, which calculates power from angular acceleration rather than actual measurement of steady state torque. The 15 hp (11 kW), then, includes both the actual frictional loss as well as the increase in angular inertia of the rapidly rotating shafts, which would not be a factor at steady speed. Nevertheless, some owners modify their engines by removing the <b>balance</b> <b>shafts,</b> both to reclaim some of this power and to reduce complexity and potential areas of breakage for high-performance and racing use, as it is commonly (but falsely) believed that the smoothness provided by the <b>balance</b> <b>shafts</b> can be attained after their removal by careful balancing of the reciprocating components of the engine.|$|R
5000|$|Straight-twin {{motorcycle}} engines (aka [...] "parallel-twin" [...] and [...] "vertical twin") historically came in {{two types}} (neither {{of which were}} [...] "cross plane"): 360° cranks (pistons moving in tandem) or 180° cranks (pistons moving in opposite phase). Beginning with Edward Turner's Triumph Speed Twin, most classic English 4-stroke roadsters (Triumph, BSA, Norton, Royal Enfield, etc) used the 360° cranks; but in the 1960s, Honda adopted the 180° cranks for its ohc 4-stroke parallel twins, such as the 450cc [...] "Black Bomber" [...] and CB500T. On a small displacement bike, the rocking couple was acceptable without a <b>balance</b> <b>shaft,</b> particularly when compared to a similar sized 360° twin similarly lacking a <b>balance</b> <b>shaft.</b> The 400cc Dream/Hawk CB250/400T replaced the 4 cylinder CB400F, and to obtain smoother running closer, it had a 360° twin with a <b>balance</b> <b>shaft</b> - the even firing of the 360° crank noticeably smoother than the uneven 180° crank.|$|E
50|$|The 2009 Yamaha YZF-R1 {{motorcycle}} uses a crossplane crankshaft {{and use a}} <b>balance</b> <b>shaft</b> geared off the crankshaft at crankshaft {{speed to}} counter the inherent rocking vibration (primary rocking couples) described above.|$|E
50|$|In {{piston engine}} engineering, a <b>balance</b> <b>shaft</b> is an {{eccentric}} weighted shaft that offsets vibrations in engine designs {{that are not}} inherently balanced. They were first invented and patented by British engineer Frederick W. Lanchester in 1904.|$|E
50|$|However, in the past, {{there were}} {{numerous}} examples of larger inline-fours without <b>balance</b> <b>shafts,</b> such as the Citroën DS 23 2,347 cc engine that was a derivative of the Traction Avant engine, the 1948 Austin 2,660 cc engine used in the Austin-Healey 100 and Austin Atlantic, the 3.3 L flathead engine used in the Ford Model A (1927), and the 2.5 L GM Iron Duke engine used {{in a number of}} American cars and trucks. Soviet/Russian GAZ Volga cars and UAZ SUVs, vans and light trucks used aluminium big-bore inline-four engines (2.5 or later 2.9 L) with no <b>balance</b> <b>shafts</b> from the 1950s-1990s. These engines were generally the result of a long incremental evolution process and their power was kept low compared to their capacity. However, the forces increase with the square of the engine speed — that is, doubling the speed makes the vibration four times more forceful — so some modern high-speed inline-fours, generally those with a displacement greater than 2.0 litres, have more need to use <b>balance</b> <b>shafts</b> to offset the vibration.|$|R
50|$|In the V6 with 120° between banks, {{pairs of}} {{connecting}} rods can share a single crank pin, {{but the two}} cylinder banks run like two inline 3, both having an end-to-end rocking couple. Unlike in a V8 engine with a crossplane crankshaft, the vibrations from one bank do not cancel the vibrations from the other, so a rotating <b>balancing</b> <b>shaft</b> is required {{to compensate for the}} primary vibrations. Because the 120° V6 is nearly as wide as a 180° flat-6 but is not nearly as smooth, and can be more expensive if a <b>balancing</b> <b>shaft</b> is added, this configuration is seldom seen in production engines.|$|R
50|$|The 2.0-litre 16-valve Twin Spark {{engine of}} the 2.0 TS model {{was based on the}} Fiat SuperFIRE-family block, {{featuring}} an Alfa Romeo-developed cylinder head with two spark plugs per cylinder.

In addition, this engine has two belt driven <b>balance</b> <b>shafts</b> rotating at twice the engine speed, to eliminate engine vibrations. The base 1.8-litre engine did not feature <b>balance</b> <b>shafts.</b> The TS was the best-selling version of the GTV and Spider. CF2 and CF3 engines have plastic valve cover and variable-length intake manifold.|$|R
