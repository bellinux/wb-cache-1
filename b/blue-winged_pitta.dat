25|$|The {{movements}} of pittas are poorly known and notoriously difficult to study. Bird ringing studies have not shed much light on this, one {{study in the}} Philippines ringed 2000 red-bellied pittas but only recaptured ten birds, and {{only one of these}} recaptures was more than two months after the initial capture. Only four species of pitta are fully or mostly migratory, all in the genus Pitta, the Indian pitta, African pitta, fairy pitta and <b>blue-winged</b> <b>pitta.</b> In addition to these four the northern subspecies of the hooded pitta (cucullata) is a full migrant. Other species make smaller or more local, and poorly understood, movements across small parts of their range, for example the noisy pitta of Australia. The migration of pittas is apparently nocturnal, and pittas migrate in small loose flocks which use the same resting and foraging sites each year.|$|E
2500|$|The clutch size {{varies by}} species. Typically {{three to five}} eggs are laid, but two is typical for the garnet pitta, whereas six is more common for the <b>blue-winged</b> <b>pitta</b> and the Indian pitta. It is thought that species {{with higher levels of}} {{predation}} tend to have smaller clutches, as smaller clutches involve fewer provisioning trips that might alert a predator to the presence of a nest, and the loss of a smaller clutch is less costly to replace. Clutch size may vary within a species depending on latitude. A study of noisy pitta found that birds in the tropics had smaller clutch sizes than those in more temperate environments. [...] The eggs of pittas are ovoid, with one end slightly pointed, and generally smooth (the deeply pitted eggs of the superb pitta being the exception to this). The size of eggs varies by species, with smaller species laying smaller eggs. There is also some variation in egg size within a species in species with large ranges. For example, the eggs of noisy pittas are smaller closer to the tropics. Eggs are typically white or creamy, and usually slightly glossy.|$|E
50|$|The German naturalist Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller first {{described}} the <b>blue-winged</b> <b>pitta</b> in 1776. It forms a superspecies with the Indian pitta (P. brachyura), fairy pitta (P. nympha) and mangrove pitta (P. megarhyncha). Alternate common names include: lesser <b>blue-winged</b> <b>pitta,</b> the little <b>blue-winged</b> <b>pitta,</b> the Moluccan pitta, the brève à ailes bleues (French), the Kleine Blauflügelpitta (German) and the pita aliazul (Spanish).|$|E
2500|$|The pittas are {{generally}} birds of tropical forests, semi-forests and scrub. Most species need forests {{with lots of}} cover, a rich understory, and leaf litter for feeding, and they are often found near waterways as well. Some species inhabit swamps and bamboos forests, and the mangrove pitta, as its name suggests, is a mangrove specialist. A number of species are lowland forest specialists, for example the rainbow pitta is not found above , whereas other species may occur at much higher elevations, for example rusty-naped pittas have been found up to [...] This varies in the fairy pitta across its range, reaching up to [...] in Taiwan but at much lower levels in Japan. In addition to natural habitats pittas may use human altered habitats, for example migrating <b>blue-winged</b> <b>pittas</b> and hooded pittas use parks and urban gardens in Singapore.|$|R

Some species inhabit swamps and bamboos forests, and the mangrove pitta, as its name suggests, is a mangrove specialist. A number of species are lowland forest specialists, for example the rainbow pitta is not found above 400 m, whereas other species may occur at much higher elevations, for example rusty-naped pittas have been found up to 2600 m. This varies in the fairy pitta across its range, reaching up to 1300 m in Taiwan but at much lower levels in Japan. In addition to natural habitats pittas may use human altered habitats, for example migrating <b>blue-winged</b> <b>pittas</b> and hooded pittas use parks and urban gardens in Singapore.The greatest diversity of pittas are found in South-east Asia. Of the three genera, the large genus Pitta is the most widespread. The two species found in Africa are from this clade, as are the most northerly species (the fairy pitta) and the most southerly (the noisy pitta). The most remote insular endemics are in this group as well, including the black-faced pitta, which is endemic to the Solomon Islands. The pittas of the clade Erythropitta are mostly found in Asia with one species, the Papuan pitta, reaching the north of Australia. The Hydrornis pittas are exclusively Asian. Some pittas have large distributions, like the hooded pitta, which ranges from Nepal to New Guinea, others have much smaller ones, like the superb pitta, which is endemic to the tiny island of Manus in the Admiralty Islands.|$|R
50|$|A {{species with}} a similar {{appearance}} is the <b>blue-winged</b> <b>pitta,</b> which {{is larger than the}} fairy pitta. The <b>blue-winged</b> <b>pitta</b> has buff crown sides and supercilia, rather than the chestnut of the fairy pitta, brighter upper tail coverts, darker yellowish brown belly, and vivid blue on upper wing coverts.|$|E
50|$|The noisy pitta is {{also known}} as the buff-breasted pitta, the lesser pitta, and the <b>blue-winged</b> <b>pitta</b> (Pitta moluccensis is another species known as the <b>blue-winged</b> <b>pitta,</b> which {{sometimes}} leads to confusion in applying their common names). It was also known colloquially as the anvil-bird (after its feeding behaviour), the bobtail and the painted thrush.|$|E
5000|$|Measuring 180 to(-) 210 mm in length, the {{mangrove}} pitta has a black {{head with}} a buff-coloured crown, white chin and buff underparts. The shoulders and mantle are greenish and the vent is reddish. Juveniles have similar patterned plumage but are duller. It resembles the <b>blue-winged</b> <b>pitta</b> but can be distinguished by its much heavier bill. Its call, transcribed as wieuw-wieuw has been noted to be [...] "more slurred" [...] than the <b>blue-winged</b> <b>pitta.</b>|$|E
5000|$|At {{breeding}} time, the <b>blue-winged</b> <b>pitta</b> {{builds a}} large nest, usually on the ground, made of twigs, roots, grasses, leaves and mosses. The spherical and untidy nest has a side entrance {{and is often}} found between tree roots near water. In its breeding range in peninsular Malaysia, the <b>blue-winged</b> <b>pitta</b> lays eggs between early May and late July each year. [...] The female lays 4-6 white or cream-coloured eggs with purple markings, and both parents take turns incubating the eggs for 15-17 days.|$|E
50|$|The song of {{the fairy}} pitta is clear and whistled kwah-he kwa-wu, {{which is similar to}} that of the <b>blue-winged</b> <b>pitta,</b> but longer and slower.|$|E
50|$|The <b>blue-winged</b> <b>pitta</b> mostly {{feeds on}} worms and insects, hunting {{them on the}} ground or from a low branch or perch. They also eat {{hard-shelled}} snails.|$|E
50|$|Pittas {{are among}} the few Old World suboscine birds. The Indian pitta is the basal member of a {{distinct}} clade that includes many of the Oriental species. It forms a superspecies with the fairy pitta (P. nympha), mangrove pitta (P. megarhyncha) and <b>blue-winged</b> <b>pitta</b> (P. moluccensis).|$|E
50|$|Mammals {{include the}} {{endangered}} Malayan tapir, threatened Sumatran serow and protected marbled cat. Other mammals include tiger, leopard cat and sun bear. Birds {{in the park}} include chestnut-bellied malkoha, orange-breasted trogon, Gould's frogmouth, <b>blue-winged</b> <b>pitta,</b> blue-crowned hanging parrot, white-crowned hornbill, oriental pied hornbill, brown boobook, black-and-red broadbill, Asian green broadbill, banded broadbill and hill myna. Reptiles include the common house gecko, large forest gecko, reticulated python, king cobra, soft-shelled turtle and the endangered sunburst turtle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mangrove}} pitta {{was first}} described by German ornithologist Hermann Schlegel in 1863. Its species name {{is derived from}} the Ancient Greek words mega- [...] "large", and rhynchos [...] "beak". It forms a superspecies with the Indian pitta (P. brachyura), fairy pitta (P. nympha) and <b>blue-winged</b> <b>pitta</b> (P. moluccensis). Alternate common names include: Larger blue-winged/Malay pitta, Brève des palétuviers (in French), Große Blauflügelpitta (in German), and Pita de Manglar (in Spanish). There are no recognized subspecies.|$|E
50|$|Measuring 180 to(-) 205 mm in length, the <b>blue-winged</b> <b>pitta</b> has a black {{head with}} a buff-coloured supercilium, white chin and buff underparts. The {{shoulders}} and mantle are greenish, the wings are bright blue, and the vent is reddish. The bill is black, eyes are brown and the legs pale pink. It has a very short tail. Juveniles have similar patterned plumage but are duller. It resembles the mangrove pitta but can be distinguished by its shorter bill. The loud call has been transcribed as taew-laew taew-laew.|$|E
50|$|The {{fairy pitta}} was first {{described}} {{as a member of}} the order Passeriformes and the family Pittidae in 1850. It was originally considered to be the same species as the Indian pitta (P. brachyura), native to India and Pakistan. However, due to differences in plumage, morphology, and vocalization, the fairy pitta was recognized as a separate species in 1996. In contemporary taxonomy, the fairy pitta forms a superspecies with the Indian pitta, mangrove pitta (P. megarhyncha) and <b>blue-winged</b> <b>pitta</b> (P. moluccensis). Among the 30 species of Pittidae worldwide, the fairy pitta is the most northerly and only species breeding in Northeast Asia.|$|E
50|$|The {{mangrove}} pitta (Pitta megarhyncha) is {{a species}} of passerine bird in the Pittidae family native to the eastern Indian Subcontinent and western Southeast Asia. It {{is part of a}} superspecies where it is placed with the Indian pitta, the fairy pitta and the <b>blue-winged</b> <b>pitta</b> but has no recognized subspecies. A colourful bird, it has a black head with brown crown, white throat, greenish upper parts, buff underparts and reddish vent area. Its range extends from India to Malaysia and Indonesia. It is found in mangrove and nipa palm forests where it feeds on crustaceans, mollusks and insects. Its call, sometimes rendered as wieuw-wieuw, is sung from a high perch on a mangrove tree.|$|E

50|$|The <b>blue-winged</b> <b>pitta</b> (Pitta moluccensis) is a {{passerine}} bird in {{the family}} Pittidae native to Australia and Southeast Asia. It forms a superspecies with three other pittas, the Indian pitta (P. brachyura), the fairy pitta (P. nympha) and the mangrove pitta (P. megarhyncha). A colourful bird, it has a black head with a buff stripe above the eye, a white collar, greenish upper parts, blue wings, buff underparts and a reddish vent area. Its range extends from India to Malaysia, Indonesia, southern China and the Philippines. Its habitat is moist woodland, parks and gardens and it avoids dense forest. It feeds mainly on insects and worms. It breeds in the spring, building an untidy spherical nest on the ground, often near water and between tree roots. A clutch of about five eggs is laid and incubated by both parents, hatching after about sixteen days.|$|E
