5|$|Foliot {{supported}} his uncle Robert de Chesney's nomination to become Bishop of Lincoln, lobbying the pope on Robert's behalf, {{and maintaining a}} long correspondence with Robert after his elevation. The letters to this uncle are full of warm sentiments, more than would <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> a dutiful correspondence. Other episcopal correspondents and friends included Roger de Pont L'Évêque, the Archbishop of York, Josceline de Bohon, the Bishop of Salisbury, and William de Turbeville, the Bishop of Norwich, who became a regular correspondent after Foliot was translated to London.|$|E
5|$|Abdominal pain(38.1%), lack of fecal {{production}} or constipation(21.1%), nausea(17.0%), diarrhea(8.2%), bloating(4.1%), and dental decay(3.4%) are also described as common symptoms in day-to-day life. These symptoms {{are not necessarily}} prevalent during regurgitation episodes, and can happen at any time. Weight loss is often observed (42.2%) at an average loss of 9.6kilograms, and {{is more common in}} cases where the disorder has gone undiagnosed {{for a longer period of}} time, though this may <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> the nutrition deficiencies that often accompany the disorder as a consequence of its symptoms. Depression has also been linked with rumination syndrome, though its effects on rumination syndrome are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Another study corroborated {{the latter}} study's results but found {{the growth rate}} to be much faster, finding it to be around 1800 {{kilograms}} (4000lbs). Although these results were much higher than previous estimations, the authors noted that these results significantly lowered the great difference between its actual growth rate and the one which would <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> an animal of its size. The sudden change in growth rate {{at the end of}} the growth spurt may indicate physical maturity, a hypothesis which is supported by the discovery of medullary tissue in the femur of a 16 to 20-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex from Montana (MOR 1125, also known as B-rex). Medullary tissue is found only in female birds during ovulation, indicating that B-rex was of reproductive age. Further study indicates an age of 18 for this specimen. In 2016, it was finally confirmed by Mary Higby Schweitzer and Lindsay Zanno et al that the soft tissue within the femur of MOR 1125 was medullary tissue. This also confirmed the identity of the specimen as a female. The discovery of medullary bone tissue within Tyrannosaurus may prove valuable in determining the sex of other dinosaur species in future examinations, as the chemical makeup of medullary tissue is unmistakable. Other tyrannosaurids exhibit extremely similar growth curves, although with lower growth rates corresponding to their lower adult sizes.|$|E

5|$|Both Berman and Piller {{sought to}} have Forbes {{sign on to}} portray Ro as a main {{character}} in the series, but she turned them down. She liked making occasional appearances on The Next Generation, but {{did not want to}} tie herself down to a five- to six-year main cast contract at that point in her career. She was also apprehensive about the types of demands fan appearances made on the stars of that series, {{and did not want to}} undertake the level of appearances that would <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> a main cast member in Deep Space Nine. The producers of Deep Space Nine decided to create a new character to fit a similar mould, which resulted in the creation of Kira Nerys, who was played by Nana Visitor. This was designed to require as minimal a change as possible in the premise of the pilot at that time, which was already under production. During the course of the series, Forbes told interviewers that she was interested in making one-off appearances in the series if she liked the story and role.|$|E

25|$|Sport is an {{integral}} part of national life in Jamaica and the island's athletes tend to perform to a standard well above what might ordinarily <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> such a small country. While the most popular local sport is cricket, on the international stage Jamaicans have tended to do particularly well at track and field athletics.|$|E
25|$|It {{might have}} been well if Nubar had {{confined}} himself to this modest programme, but it was perhaps hardly to <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> {{a man of his}} ability and restless energy. It must be admitted, however, that the characters of Nubar and Lord Cromer were not formed to run in harness, and it was with no surprise that the public learnt in June 1888 that he had been relieved of office, though his dismissal was the direct act of the khedive Tawfiq, who did not on this occasion seek the advice of the British agent.|$|E

25|$|The {{change in}} {{political}} structure {{led to the}} inevitable development of the peasant class or smerdy. The smerdy were free un-landed people that found work by labouring for wages on the manors which began to develop around 1031 as the verv' began to dominate socio-political structure. The smerdy were initially given equality in the Kievian law code, they were theoretically equal to the prince, so they enjoyed as much freedom as can <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> manual labourers. However, in the 13th century they began to slowly lose their rights and became less equal {{in the eyes of}} the law.|$|E
25|$|The great {{period of}} Renaissance weaving in Brussels {{dates from the}} weaving {{entrusted}} by Pope Leo X to a consortium of its ateliers of the Acts of the Apostles after cartoons by Raphael, between 1515 and 1519. Leo must have been motivated by the already high technical quality of Brussels tapestries. The conventions of a monumental pictorial representation {{with the effects of}} perspective that would <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> a fresco or other wall decoration were applied {{for the first time in}} this prestigious set; the framing of the central subject within wide borders that proved able to be brought up to date in successive weavings, was also introduced in these 'Raphael' tapestries.|$|E
25|$|The main {{exports of}} Aksum were, as would <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> a state during this time, {{agricultural}} products. The land {{was much more}} fertile {{during the time of}} the Aksumites than now, and their principal crops were grains such as wheat and barley. The people of Aksum also raised cattle, sheep, and camels. Wild animals were also hunted for things such as ivory and rhinoceros horns. They traded with Roman traders as well as with Egyptian and Persian merchants. The empire was also rich with gold and iron deposits. These metals were valuable to trade, but another mineral was also widely traded: salt. Salt was abundant in Aksum and was traded quite frequently.|$|E

25|$|It was in December 1983 {{announced}} {{from the}} Office of the Prime Minister of Canada that Trudeau had put forward Sauvé's name to Queen Elizabeth II as his recommendation on who should succeed Edward Schreyer as the Queen's representative. In the national media, the reception was generally positive, with Sauvé's elegance, refined nature, and bilingualism {{viewed as an}} asset to such a posting, despite speculation regarding her ability to remain non-partisan, as would <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> the vicereine. However, by January 15, of the following year Sauvé resigned as an MP, and thus as speaker, and two days later she was hospitalised; rumours circulated that {{it was due to}} cancer, but the official story was that she had contracted a respiratory virus, which was further complicated by an allergy to antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|People rely on compulsions as {{an escape}} from their obsessive thoughts; however, they are aware that the relief is only temporary, that the {{intrusive}} thoughts will soon return. Some people use compulsions to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people do certain things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on {{the context in which}} the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering DVDs for eight hours a day would <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> one who works in a video store, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while compulsions tend to disrupt it.|$|E
