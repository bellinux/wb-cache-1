5|$|The Albany Free School is {{the oldest}} independent, inner-city {{alternative}} school in the United States. Founded by Mary Leue in 1969 based on the English Summerhill School philosophy, the free school lets students learn at their own pace. It has no grades, tests, or firm schedule: students design their own daily plans for learning. The school is self-governed through a weekly, democratic all-school meeting run <b>by</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> Robert's Rules. Students and staff alike receive one equal vote apiece. Unlike Summerhill-style schools, the Albany Free School is a day school that serves predominantly working-class children. Nearly 80 percent of the school is eligible for reduced-price meals in the public schools. About 60 students {{between the ages of}} three and fourteen attend, and are staffed by six full-time teachers and a number of volunteers.|$|E
