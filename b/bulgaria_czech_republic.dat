5|$|In the United Kingdom, English wine {{producers}} have experimented with growing the variety in plastic tunnels which {{can create a}} greenhouse effect and protect the grapes from the less than ideal climate of the wine region. While the grape is permitted to be planted in some German wine regions (such as the Mosel), the vineyard sites best suited for ripening Cabernet are generally already occupied with Riesling; many producers are ill-inclined to uproot the popular German variety in favor of Cabernet Sauvignon. In the 1980s, inexpensive Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignon was highly touted for its value and helped to establish that country's wine industry and garner it more international presence in the wine market. The grape is performing a similar function for many countries in Eastern Europe, including Turkey, <b>Bulgaria,</b> <b>Czech</b> <b>Republic,</b> Georgia, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, Slovenia, and Ukraine.

25|$|On 1 July 2013, Croatian {{nationals}} became European Union {{citizens and}} acquired {{the right to}} move and reside freely in other EU member states, {{as well as in}} Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. On the same day, 14 EU member states (<b>Bulgaria,</b> <b>Czech</b> <b>Republic,</b> Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Sweden) allowed Croatian nationals to work without restrictions in their country. However, 13 other EU member states imposed transitional restrictions on Croatian nationals wishing to access their labour markets. Annex V of the Treaty concerning the accession of the Republic of Croatia to the European Union allows member states to apply national measures regulating Croatian nationals’ access to their labour markets for a period of up to five years, and in case of serious disturbance to their labour markets or the threat thereof, and after notifying the Commission, for a further two years (i.e. up to a maximum of seven years in total).|$|E

25|$|EU as a {{security}} provider: Management of post Soviet-er{{a security}} tensions in bordering States (Ukraine, Georgia and Balkan States) has exposed deep-rooted structural weaknesses of European Union institutions. European Union's collective response on matters ranging from {{the management of the}} exodus of refugees from war-torn Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, participation in NATO-led interventions, action against non-State entities (Islamic State & Al-Qaeda), etc. suffers from differing priorities of 28 European Union member States. The paucity of strategic vision within the European Council, nationality-quota based allotment of senior bureaucratic positions within the Institutions of the European Union, and the capacity of minor European countries to unduly influence policy choices of the European Union is problematic. Decision taking by Brussels-based European stake-holders is cumbersome and severely limited due to intra-EU politics and the obsession with Byzantine Community method consensus-based decision making procedures. The Ukrainian crisis exposed the shortcomings of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and outlined the limits of German military clout. Public disenchantment with the political outcomes of recent military interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya has emptied political support for accrued European Union involvement in the Syrian and Ukrainian crisis. Further strengthening of European Union sanctions regime against Russia faces internal dissent from several EU member States (Austria, <b>Bulgaria,</b> <b>Czech</b> <b>Republic,</b> Greece, Cyprus, Spain, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Finland) besides being largely ignored by European multinationals (German and Italian companies have most investment exposure in Russia) who bypass the sanctions regime by trading with Russia via third-countries (Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Israel). A 2015 Pew Research survey indicated that Europeans are by and large not favourable to a military deployment by their country under the terms of NATO Article 5 to protect a fellow member country which comes under attack.|$|E
