5|$|According to Kaga, upon release Shadow Dragon and the <b>Blade</b> <b>of</b> Light {{received}} extensive {{criticism from}} Japanese publications, with many noting {{that it was}} difficult to understand and had fairly poor graphics, awarding it low scores. In contrast, popular opinion was more positive: in a poll taken by Family Computer Magazine, the game scored 23.48 points out of 30. Likewise, sales of the game were flat for the first two months of sales, but improved after word of mouth had spread. According to Kaga, a notable journalistic writer devoted a Famitsu column to the game, and this prompted sales to pick up around half a year after release. As of 2002, Shadow Dragon and the <b>Blade</b> <b>of</b> Light had sold 329,087 units, being the third best-selling title in the series to that date.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the slow}} start, Shadow Dragon and the <b>Blade</b> <b>of</b> Light proved {{enough of a}} success that a new game was commissioned. This would become Fire Emblem Gaiden, which {{released}} in 1992. Shadow Dragon and the <b>Blade</b> <b>of</b> Light was partially remade {{as part of the}} 1994 release , which also continued the story of Marth. A full remake for the Nintendo DS was later developed. It would release internationally under the title , marking the first time the content of the first Fire Emblem was made available outside Japan. The setting of Archanea would later be used again in the 2012/3 entry Fire Emblem Awakening.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{increased}} hardware capabilities, the team were able to increase both the content and graphical quality. With the aim of encouraging new players to buy the game, the overall difficulty was reduced compared to previous entries. After the unconventional gameplay of Gaiden, Mystery of the Emblem returned to the traditional gameplay used for Shadow Dragon and the <b>Blade</b> <b>of</b> Light, in addition to continuing the story of Marth after focusing on different characters for Gaiden. Mystery of the Emblem was initially only going to include original story content, but after consideration, {{it was decided to}} include an upgraded version of Shadow Dragon and the <b>Blade</b> <b>of</b> Light for those who had not played the original. Another proposed plan was to split the release into two parts: a remake of Shadow Dragon and the <b>Blade</b> <b>of</b> Light and Mystery of the Emblem. Due to space limitations, some characters featured in the original version of Shadow Dragon and the <b>Blade</b> <b>of</b> Light needed to be cut. The romance between Marth and Caeda was introduced as a refined version of a similar plot featured in Gaiden. As with previous games set in Archanea, the series' titular Fire Emblem took the form of a shield inset with five magical gems. According to Kaga, Mystery of the Emblem was intended as the last major title to be set on the continent of Archanea.|$|E

5|$|Kaga {{designed}} Gaiden {{to address}} issues raised with the first game, such as tedious elements of map navigation. The system of Shadow Dragon and the <b>Blade</b> <b>of</b> Light was used as base for various improvements to aspects such as enemy AI, although the gameplay adjustments ended up removing some of the strategic elements. These elements included a navigable overworld and more overt role-playing elements, along {{with the introduction of}} the class evolution system. Balancing these elements proved challenging for the team. The game made use of the new MMC4 memory chip, developed partially in response to the memory capacity problems faced during the development of the first game. For the story, Kaga wanted to deepen the relationship between the player and their units, represented through the growth of the characters through their battles. To create a stronger and broader central narrative, Kaga created the game's dual protagonists. An overt reference to Shadow Dragon and the <b>Blade</b> <b>of</b> Light was made {{in the form of a}} trio of female Pegasus Knights, who were similar to another trio from the first game yet bore different names.|$|E

She tells Kratos that her sacrifice has brought her to a higher existence, and she now sees truths she did not see before. She states that as long as Zeus reigns, there is no hope for mankind. She gives him the Blades of Exile and says that to kill Zeus, he must quench the Flame of Olympus. After finding the three Judges of the Underworld and the Chain of Balance, Kratos encounters the spirit of Pandora, whom he mistakes for his dead daughter, Calliope. Refusing to help the child, he continues his quest. After encountering the Olympian blacksmith Hephaestus and recovering the <b>Blade</b> <b>of</b> Olympus, he kills Hades, which releases the souls of the Underworld. When he considers searching for the soul of Calliope, Athena reminds Kratos of his quest, and he leaves the Underworld, arriving at Olympia. There he finds the wounded Gaia, who calls for help. He severs her arm, causing her to fall from Mount Olympus to her apparent death.|$|E

The basic mechanics within Shadow Dragon and the <b>Blade</b> <b>of</b> Light would {{form the basis for}} the gameplay of nearly all subsequent Fire Emblem titles. In addition to helping popularize the genre, it is also credited with pioneering multimedia advertising through its use of a live-action television commercial in addition to magazine previews, which would later be used for series such as The Legend of Zelda. Its combination of battle and story segments also provided inspiration for the gameplay of the Sakura Wars series.|$|E

5|$|When sailing {{the western}} side of Spitzbergen, a <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> the {{propeller}} of the Island was damaged in a collision with an ice floe. When the engine was run, severe vibration was felt and this forced Worsley to continue northwards under sail, searching for Gillis Land until the ship reached the pack ice. While doing so, soundings were taken which confirmed the presence of a submarine plain between Spitzbergen and the island group of Franz Josef Land. Turning south and sailing along the northern coast of Spitzbergen, a previously uncharted harbour was found, which Algarsson named after Worsley. The ship then sailed north, still seeking Gillis Land, but became trapped in the ice. Worsley took the opportunity to create an ice dock to facilitate repairs to the rudder, which had become damaged. After two weeks beset in the ice, he used the engine to break free but the last <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> the propeller was lost in the process.|$|E

5|$|Although Kratos killed Poseidon, he was {{abandoned}} by Gaia when his {{first encounter with}} Zeus went poorly. Stranded in the Underworld and now betrayed by both the Olympians and Titans, Kratos learned from the spirit of Athena, who also provided the Blades of Exile, {{that he needed to}} find the Flame of Olympus, which is the key to defeating Zeus. Kratos murdered both Titans and gods, ignoring the warnings of his victims as he sought the Flame. Realizing the key to pacifying the Flame and reaching Pandora's Box (engulfed by the Flame) is Pandora herself, Kratos came to care for Pandora, who reminded him of his lost daughter Calliope. Kratos showed humanity when he attempted to stop Pandora from sacrificing herself to quench the Flame, but reluctantly allowed the act when she said there was no other option. Finding the box empty, and driven berserk by Zeus' mockery, Kratos attacked his father. Although Gaia interrupted and tried to kill Kratos and Zeus, she was destroyed by Kratos, who then apparently defeated Zeus. Zeus returned in spirit form and attacked Kratos, who retreated into his psyche. Kratos forgave himself for his past sins with the help of Lysandra. Pandora later appeared and told Kratos that hope would save him. Kratos was revived and easily destroyed Zeus. Athena confronted Kratos and demanded that he return the power of hope; the contents of Pandora's Box. In a selfless act, Kratos refused, stated his need for vengeance was gone and impaled himself with the <b>Blade</b> <b>of</b> Olympus, which dispersed the power across the world for mankind's use. Athena, disappointed with Kratos, removed the Blade and departed as Kratos collapsed next to the <b>Blade</b> <b>of</b> Olympus. The post-credits scene showed a trail of blood leading away from the Blade with Kratos' whereabouts unknown.|$|E
