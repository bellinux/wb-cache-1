25|$|The UPWA also adopted {{policies}} {{and engaged in}} activities to oppose racism. Unlike many unions of the era, the UPWA insisted that Caucasian and African American employees receive the same wages, benefits, and workplace rights. The union's racial integration policies were among the strongest of any American union of the day. and the UPWA was the most integrated CIO union (<b>by</b> <b>race</b> <b>and</b> gender). The union's anti-discrimination efforts were {{a key part of}} its new member organizing strategy, and in time almost a third of the union's members were African American. The union also focused on organizing worksites which employed large numbers of black workers. In June 1947, it organized the faculty and services workers at Howard University, a historically black college. The first African American woman to lead a union in New York state was UPWA's Eleanor Godling (who also served on executive board of the New York State CIO). The UPWA made the federal government a primary target for its equality in employment efforts. In early 1947, UPWA accused nine federal agencies and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development of blatantly refusing to hire African Americans. The Veterans' Administration and State Department were the agencies most resistant to the UPWA on racial issues. UPWA was also the only union to make a significant effort at integrating the United States Post Office Department. In August 1949, UPWA members (accompanied by actor and singer Paul Robeson) picketed the White House to protest racially discriminatory hiring and employment practices and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.|$|E
500|$|During the Palaiologan dynasty, {{after the}} Byzantines recaptured Constantinople, Rhomaioi became again {{dominant}} {{as a term}} for self-description and there are few traces of Hellene, {{such as in the}} writings of George Gemistos Plethon; the neo-platonic philosopher boasted [...] "We are Hellenes <b>by</b> <b>race</b> <b>and</b> culture," [...] and proposed a reborn Byzantine Empire following a utopian Hellenic system of government centered in Mystras. Under the influence of Plethon, John Argyropoulos, addressed Emperor John VIII Palaiologos (r. 1425–1448) as [...] "Sun King of Hellas" [...] and urged the last Byzantine emperor, Constantine XI Palaiologos (r. 1449–1453), to proclaim himself [...] "King of the Hellenes". These largely rhetorical expressions of Hellenic identity were confined in a very small circle and had no impact on the people. They were however continued by Byzantine intellectuals who participated in the Italian Renaissance.|$|E
500|$|During {{the initial}} {{planning}} {{process of the}} 1980s, the Aquarium was also presented as {{a means by which}} Chattanooga could overcome the difficulties of its recent past. [...] Planners hoped that as a project free of historic ties, the Aquarium would be embraced by all parts of a community traditionally divided <b>by</b> <b>race</b> <b>and</b> by economic and social class. [...] In the 1990s, development of a [...] "world-class" [...] aquarium was considered a sign of hope for the economically-depressed city and evidence of its ability to come together to create civic improvements. [...] As downtown Chattanooga continues to develop, the city has emerged as an example of successful revitalization in older American urban areas; the Aquarium is recognized {{as an example of the}} [...] "Chattanooga Way," [...] which relies on cooperation among the city, foundations and private enterprise, plus a high degree of public involvement, to complete significant projects in the community despite limited government resources. [...] Viewed as part of Chattanooga's revitalization, however, its impact is disputed. [...] Chattanooga remains a heavily segregated city, and some argue that the [...] "placemaking" [...] to which the Aquarium contributes has exacerbated this problem.|$|E

500|$|In 1948, {{a second}} [...] "Petrillo ban" [...] on music {{recording}} was enforced by American Federation of Musicians (AFM) {{in response to}} the Taft–Hartley Act. Capitol Records was desperate to release something for sustaining any profit, and ultimately released [...] "Nature Boy" [...] as a single on March 29, 1948, with catalog number 15054. Crestview Music, which owned publishing right for Cole's songs, sold the rights for [...] "Nature Boy" [...] to Burke-Van Heusen, who acted as distributor and selling agent. The record debuted on the Billboard charts of April 16, 1948, and stayed there for 15 weeks, ultimately peaking at number one. It also reached a peak of number two on the R charts. [...] "Nature Boy" [...] went on to sell a million copies in 1948 and Billboard DJs listed it as the greatest record of the year, with the song accumulating a total of 743 points. The 1940s, American music market was divided <b>by</b> <b>race</b> <b>and</b> for a black artist to cross over to mainstream pop music was difficult. Author Krin Gabbard noted in his book Jammin' at the Margins: Jazz and the American Cinema that Cole had to wear white makeup while filming for the performance of the song. Although he had come into prominence in 1930 as a leader of the jazz trio named King Cole Trio, it was with [...] "Nature Boy" [...] that he received widespread recognition, and it was his rendition that appealed to the white audience. Cole would later use the success of the song to cancel the trio and pursue a solo recording career; he later described [...] "Nature Boy" [...] as one of his favorites among his recordings. The success of the song allowed ahbez to accumulate about US$20,000 ($ in [...] dollars) in royalty. However, Billboard reported that ahbez kept only 50% of the royalty for himself, and distributed the rest among people who had helped him in bringing the song to limelight. About 25% was shared with Mrs. Loraine Tatum for helping him with the lyrics and the rest with Pollard, for bringing the song to Cole's notice.|$|E
