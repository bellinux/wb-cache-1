40|$|Management of sediments from coastal areas, {{contaminated}} with heavy metals and organic substances, {{is a very}} critical issue. Management decisions are usually based on total pollutant concentrations and various guidelines that are used by different countries. Heavy metals can be mobilized from polluted sediments if {{they are exposed to}} changing environmental conditions that occur during excavation, disposal at sea, or disposal in confined facilities. This paper examines the changes in heavy metals partitioning to binding phases in contaminated marine sediments and the release of metals to the environment. Environmental conditions are simulated by submitting sediments to a modified elutriation test with oxygenated and deoxygenated seawater. A sequential extraction procedure is used to determine the <b>binding</b> <b>fractions</b> of heavy metals in the sediments. Fractionation analysis of excavated marine sediments from the port of Piraeus, Greece showed that copper is primarily associated with organic matter, whereas lead and zinc are primarily associated with iron oxides. Under anoxic conditions, the metals bound to the various <b>binding</b> <b>fractions</b> remain practically stable. On the other hand, under oxic conditions, an increase in the concentration of metals associated with carbonates and a decrease in the concentration of metals associated with organic matter and iron oxides were observed. Both under oxic and anoxic conditions, actual metal mobility was very low and less than 0. 5 % of total metal mass was found in the dissolved phase. Copyright © 2009 by ASTM International...|$|R

Three fractions were obtained: I, sedimented between 2, 500 - 15, 000 X g; II at 40, 000 X g; and III, at 150, 000 X g. Fraction II was further purified on a sucrose density gradient. All three fractions contained considerable amounts of intrinsic calcium, mostly in <b>fraction</b> I. Calcium <b>binding</b> {{in the presence}} of ATP 1 and Mg also was greatest in fraction I, followed by fraction II, with less in fraction III. Without ATP no calcium was taken up. 5 and 10 mM sodium azide partially inhibited calcium <b>binding</b> in <b>fraction</b> I, but not in fraction II, suggesting the presence of some mitochondria or mitochondrial fragments in <b>fraction</b> I. Calcium <b>binding</b> in <b>fraction</b> II was completely inhibited by 3 mM salyrgan; this fraction thus appears to be sarcoplasmic reticulum. ATPase activity was found in all three fractions, highest in fraction II.

Dicotyledonous plants absorb Fe in the ferrous (Fe+ 2) form.

Analyses of the heparin-catalysed rate of inhibition of thrombin further showed that the fractions differed only in their affinity for heparin and not in the intrinsic rate constant of either the uncatalysed or the heparin-catalysed inactivation of thrombin. The recombinant antithrombin fraction with lower heparin affinity migrated more slowly than both the fraction with higher affinity and plasma antithrombin in SDS/PAGE under reducing conditions, consistent with a slightly higher apparent relative molecular mass. This apparent size difference was abolished by the enzymic removal of the carbohydrate side chains from the proteins. Such removal also increased the heparin affinity of the weakly <b>binding</b> <b>fraction,</b> so that it eluted from matrix-linked heparin at a similar position to the deglycosylated tightly <b>binding</b> <b>fraction</b> or plasma antithrombin. Analyses of N-linked carbohydrate side chains showed that the weakly <b>binding</b> <b>fraction</b> from CHO cells had a higher proportion of tetra-antennary and a lower proportion of biantennary oligosaccharides than the tightly <b>binding</b> <b>fraction.</b> We conclude that the recombinant antithrombin produced by the two cell lines is heterogeneously glycosylated and that the increased carbohydrate content of {{a large proportion of the}} molecules results in a substantial decrease in the affinity of these molecules for heparin.

To facilitate the identification of solubilized putative toxin-binding proteins, a solid-phase binding assay was developed and compared with toxin overlay assays. The overlay assays demonstrated that a number of proteins of 170, 140, 120, 90, 75, 60, and 50 kDa bound the radiolabeled CryIA(c) toxin. Anion-exchange fractionation allowed the separation of these proteins into three toxin <b>binding</b> <b>fractions,</b> or pools. Toxin overlay assays demonstrated that although the three pools had distinct protein profiles, similar-size proteins could be detected in these three pools.

Fe/Mn-oxides provided more binding sites for trace metals in dry season (1. 64 mg kg - 1) and rainy season (1. 97 mg kg - 1).

Significant correlations imply same source of pollution. Correlation analyses of organically bound trace metals and sediment phases show that organically bound Zn in dry season and Cu in rainy season strongly correlated with carbonates and OM, respectively, implying that the predicted amount of these metals are more accurate than those of other organically bound trace metals.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine if colonic mucus and its constituents, including mucin derived from goblet cells, inhibited RDEC- 1 adherence in vitro. Crude mucus was prepared from mucosal scrapings of rabbit colon and separated by buoyant density into eight fractions. Purified mucin was characterized by gel electrophoresis, dot immunoblotting, indirect immunofluorescence, and amino acid composition. RDEC- 1 bacteria were grown to promote and suppress the expression of mannose-resistant, hydrophobic pili. A nonpiliated mutant, strain M 34, was also used as a negative control. Binding of radiolabeled RDEC- 1 expressing pili was quantitated in the presence of crude mucus, purified mucin, and nonmucin fractions. Binding of piliated RDEC- 1 to hydrophobic polystyrene wells was greater than for both nonpiliated RDEC- 1 and strain M 34 (P less than 0. 05). Both crude mucus and purified mucin mediated a concentration-dependent inhibition of piliated-RDEC- 1 <b>binding.</b> <b>Fractions</b> of mucus without immunoreactive mucin did not inhibit the binding of RDEC- 1 expressing hydrophobic pili.

The concentrations of suspended particulate matters of YLZ were higher than those of GBD during resuspension, indicating that the former sediment is more sensitive to the velocity. Cr in the dissolved phase stayed nearly constant at about 2. 25 and 1. 84 mu g/L for YLZ and GBD, respectively, due to the high percentage of its stable <b>binding</b> <b>fractions</b> in both sediments, while Cu, Zn, and Pb showed a fast release in the initial period of time.

In addition, the binding form and heavy metal fractions were also found to vary during the resuspension event.

In additon, analysis of the fetuin <b>binding</b> <b>fraction</b> by gelatin substrate zymography was performed, and demonstrated the presence of two bands of 96 and 140 kDa exhibiting metalloprotease-activity. The metalloprotease activity readily degraded glycosylated proteins such as fetuin and bovine immunoglobulin G heavy chain, whereas non-glycosylated proteins such as bovine serum albumin and immunoglobulin G light chain were not affected. These findings suggest that the fetuin-binding fraction of Neospora caninum tachyzoites contains components that could be potentially involved in host-parasite interaction...|$|E
40|$|High-affinity [3 H]serotonin binding {{activity}} has been solubilized from bovine cerebral cortical membranes by using Triton X- 100, Tween- 80, and octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside. This mixture of detergents solubilizes the high-affinity [3 H]serotonin binding activity present in crude membrane preparations with retention of 75 - 90 % specific binding. The detergent mixture {{was chosen because}} it can easily {{be removed from the}} solubilized fraction by dialysis and polystyrene bead adsorption, thus permitting further purification and isolation of the binding sites. Saturation analysis reveals multiple components of high-affinity [3 H]serotonin binding. In crude bovine cortical membranes, at least two binding components are present. A higher-affinity binding component, as defined from curvilinear Scatchard plots, has a Kd for [3 H]serotonin of 1 - 3 nM, whereas a lower-affinity component has a Kd of 10 - 20 nM. In the solubilized preparation, only a single class of binding sites is apparent, with a Kd of 50 - 100 nM. Removal of detergents by dialysis and polystyrene bead adsorption results in restoration of the curvilinear Scatchard plot with apparent Kds similar to those observed in crude membrane preparations and with increased Bmax values for each component. [3 H]Serotonin binding activity in the solubilized preparation is stable to Sephacryl S- 300 column chromatography and to glycerol gradient sedimentation. Saturation analysis of the peak <b>binding</b> <b>fractions</b> from both these procedures once again yields curvilinear Scatchard plots, indicating that the multiple high-affinity binding components are preserved and migrate together. The molecular weight, Stokes radius, and frictional coefficient of the binding site(s) have been calculated. After detergent removal the solubilized material shows many of the characteristics usually attributed to S 1 receptors, such as high affinity for [3 H]serotonin and its analogs and low affinity for serotonin antagonists...|$|R
40|$|Dodecanedioic acid (C 12), a saturated, {{aliphatic}} {{dicarboxylic acid}} with 12 carbon atoms, was given as an intravenous bolus (800 mumol/kg {{of body weight}} [kgBW]) in male Wistar rats to study its pharmacokinetic profile. Because total plasma C 12, which results from the sum of both free and albumin <b>binding</b> <b>fractions,</b> was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, an in vitro experimental session was carried out to determine the binding curve of C 12 in rat plasma. These data were then {{used to calculate the}} plasma C 12 free fraction in in vivo experiments. The best fit obtained for the experimental data of albumin binding was obtained with the equation of reversible, saturable binding to one, two, or three classes of noninteracting equivalent sites. Only a single binding site was clearly identified with a dissociation constant of 147 mumol/L and a maximal predicted binding of 1. 57 mol/mol albumin. The urinary excretion of C 12 was 3. 90 +/- 1. 62 % of the administered dose. The pharmacokinetic analysis was performed by one-compartment model with linear transfer to the tissues, taking into account simultaneously both plasma concentration and urine excretion data. The apparent volume of distribution of C 12 was 0. 248 +/- 0. 035 L/kgBW, the apparent first order rate constant to the tissues was 0. 0535 +/- 0. 0123 min- 1 and that from plasma to urine was 0. 00206 +/- 0. 00051 min- 1. The C 12 plasma half-life was 12. 47 minutes. Renal clearance was 0. 00051 L/kgBW per minute, whereas the systemic clearance was 0. 0138 L/kgBW per minute. Because the renal clearance was much less than the rat inulin clearance reported in literature, the presence of C 12 passive back-diffusion was hypothesized...|$|R
40|$|We {{fractionated}} {{a series}} of West African and West Australian crude oils into the four standard solubility classes: saturates, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes (SARA). The asphaltene fraction was then separated further into classes we have called binding resins (BR) and residual asphaltenes (RA) using a solvent of near-boiling heptane. The ratio ≡ BR/RA correlates strongly with the tightness of water-in-oil emulsions that these oils formed either in the field or the laboratory. Crucially, only the oil with > 1 did not form a stable emulsion and, for the oils which did, the smaller the value of, the tighter the observed emulsion {{in terms of its}} longevity and separation characteristics. Two-dimensional GC-MS was used to analyze the resin and <b>binding</b> resin <b>fractions,</b> which lead to the preliminary identification of the main components...|$|R
40|$|The human {{carcinoma}} {{cell line}} RPMI 2650 produces autocrine factors. These are detected by {{the ability of}} RPMI 2650 conditioned medium (CM) to stimulate growth in soft agar of RPMI 2650 cells plated at low density The autocrine activity in crude CM can be fractionated by ultrafiltration into a lower molecular weight (MW) fraction (Rl- 30), which concentrates molecules in the X, 000 - 30, 000 kDa range, and a higher MW fraction (R 30) with molecules greater than 30, 000 kDa in a more concentrated form Rl- 30 is labile to acid, base and heat treatment, whereas R 30 is stable to (and sometimes activated by) these treatments. Boiling of R 30, however, renders it labile to acid-, base- and trypsin-treatments CM can be separated into a weakly heparin-bindmg fraction (with stability properties similar to Rl- 30), and a non-heparin <b>binding</b> <b>fraction</b> (with stability properties similar to R 30) RPMI 2650 cells secrete TGF-a- and TGF-B-hke molecules, but the Rl- 30 can be distinguished from these TGFs, and from most other known growth factors, by the unusual combination of acid lability and weak affinity for heparin Since the R 30 /non-heparin <b>binding</b> <b>fraction</b> is rendered labile by boiling or acid treatment, it may represent a bound or conformâtlonally stable form of a growth factor Growth factor production from RPMI 2650 cells was successfully scaled up to a 2 litre scale...|$|E

The serodiagnostic and prognostic potential of BSM as a capture antigen was established by ELISA with no cross reactivity with coendemic diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, chagas disease and cutaneous leishmaniasis; however, a strong cross reactivity was present with trypanosomiasis patients. In 56 clinically diagnosed VL patients, the BSM-ELISA was compared with diagnosis by microscopy using Giemsa stained tissue smears and direct ELISA using crude parasite antigen (parasite-ELISA); 49 / 56 (87. 5...|$|E
40|$|Preparations of {{partially}} purified chloroplast DNA-dependent RNA polymerase from maize {{and some}} other plants transcribe cloned chloroplast genes preferentially and much more actively from appropriately negatively supercoiled templates than from relaxed templates. We {{have found that the}} polymerase in such fractions does not bind to promoter regions of the maize chloroplast genes psbA and rbcL on small linear DNA fragments but that some protein(s) in unfractionated chloroplast extracts does bind. DEAE chromatography of the extracts has permitted the separation of a DNA-binding fraction from the bulk of the RNA polymerase activity.

40|$|A {{total of}} 65 pollen types were {{identified}} {{from two years}} atmospheric pollen survey in the environmental conditions of South Assam. Out of them, eight pollen types viz., Acacia auriculiformis, Amaranthus spinosus, Cassia alata, Cleome gynandra, Cocos nucifera, Imperata cylindrica, Ricinus communis and Trewia nudiflora, were selected for biochemical studies {{on the basis of}} their dominance in the study sites. Among the sample extract tested, Ricinus communis was found to contain the highest amount of soluble protein, free amino acid and total carbohydrate, per gram of dry weight followed by Imperata cylindrica and Cassia alata. Maximum numbers of protein polypeptide bands were detected in the sample extract of Cassia alata by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis method followed by Acacia auriculiformis, Imperata cylindrica and Cocos nucifera.

40|$|Cartilage {{from the}} avian mutant nanomelia has been {{reported}} to synthesize cartilage-specific proteoglycans, PGS(SC) -I, at 1 - 2 % of normal values [McKeown & Goetinck (1979) Dev. Biol. 71, 203 - 215]. Proteoglycans were endogenously labelled with [35 S]sulphate and extracted from cartilage in 4 M-guanidine hydrochloride and chromatographed on controlled-pore glass 1400. PGS(SC) -I was obtained from the void volume of these columns. Dissociative sucrose-density-gradient analysis revealed a greater than normal polydispersity in the nanomelic PGS(SC) -I. Fractions from both the controlled-pore glass 1400 void volume and sucrose gradients were tested for their ability to bind specific antibody against cartilage proteoglycan monomer. In all instances, <b>binding</b> of normal <b>fractions</b> was greater than 90 %, whereas <b>binding</b> to nanomelic <b>fractions</b> ranged from 20 to 65 %. Chromatography of PGS(SC) -I on controlled-pore glass 2500 resulted in 70 % of the normal and 25 % of the mutant proteoglycans eluting as aggregates. Chondroitin sulphate chains from mutant PGS(SC) -I appeared slightly larger than normal when chromatographed on controlled-pore glass 500. In addition, PGS(SC) -I from nanomelic cartilage is more susceptible to proteolysis in vitro than the PGS(SC) -I from normal cartilage. This evidence suggests that the small amount of cartilage-specific proteoglycan synthesized by nanomelic cartilage is not normal...|$|R
