When the amalgamated surfaces of contact are quite clean and dry, the spark, on making contact, is quite as brilliant as on breaking it, if not even more so. When a film of oxide or dirt was present at either mercurial surface, then the first spark was often feeble, and often failed, the <b>breaking</b> <b>spark,</b> however, continuing very constant and bright. When a little water was put over the mercury, the spark was greatly diminished in brilliancy, but very regular both on making and breaking contact. When the contact was made between clean platina, the spark was also very small, but regular both ways. The true electric spark is, in fact, very small, and when surfaces of mercury are used, it is the combustion of the metal which produces the greater part of the light. The circumstances connected with the burning of the mercury are most favourable on breaking contact; for the act of separation exposes clean surfaces of metal, whereas, on making contact, a thin film of oxide, or soiling matter, often interferes. Hence the origin of the general opinion that it is only when the contact is broken that the spark passes.|$|R

25|$|Tesla {{experimented with}} these, and many other, circuit {{configurations}} (see right). The Tesla coil primary winding, spark gap and tank capacitor are connected in series. In each circuit, the AC supply transformer charges the tank capacitor until its voltage {{is sufficient to}} <b>break</b> down the <b>spark</b> gap. The gap suddenly fires, allowing the charged tank capacitor to discharge into the primary winding. Once the gap fires, the electrical behavior of either circuit is identical. Experiments have shown that neither circuit offers any marked performance advantage over the other.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Core and conal {{emission}} {{beams of}} radio pulsars {{have been identified}} observationally (Rankin 1983, 1993 a,b; Lyne and Manchester 1988). In the inner gap model (Ruderman and Sutherland 1975, hereafter RS 75), the gap continually <b>breaks</b> down (<b>sparking)</b> by forming electron-positron pairs on a time scale of a few microseconds (RS 75). This makes a large amplitude low frequency wave which would be scattered by relativistic particles moving out from the gap. Under this assumption, Qiao (1988 a, 1992) presented an Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS) model for both core and conal emissions. This paper develops the model. Retardation and aberration effects due to different radiation components emitted from different heights are considered. The luminosity of pulsar radio emission via the ICS process is discussed. Coherent emission by bunches of particles is adequate to explain pulsar radiation. The theoretical results agree with observations very well.

40|$|My dissertation, Beyond Incarceration: Prison Literature and Political Subjectivation in Cold War Latin America, {{analyzes}} prison literature {{written about}} political prisoners’ experience during the military dictatorships in Paraguay, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay {{in the second}} half of the 20 th century. I investigate how the political function of prisons was reshaped within the repressive strategies of Latin American states, by concentrating on specific moments in which prison <b>breaks</b> <b>sparked</b> public debate that altered the social perception of the political. Drawing on the historical, sociological, and political archives and debates of the times, I read Roa Bastos’ Hijo de Hombre, Manuel Puig’s El beso de la mujer araña, Augusto Boal’s Torquemada, and José Charlo and Aldo Garay’s film El círculo to unravel the underlying tissues of silences, erasures and oblivion, i. e. the political unconscious that shaped leftist subjectivities from within prison walls. My research intervenes in the cultural studies inquiry about Cold War conditions in Latin America: Since the end of the Southern Cone dictatorships, debates about cultural history in the area have been dominated by very valuable work dealing with the ‘politics of memory’. These post-dictatorship debates have centered on human rights but also on bearing witness to state violence and trauma via literature, testimonio, and film in subsequent years. While this has been very important work, it has tended to leave some questions from that period unaddressed. My research returns to the dictatorships during the Cold War in order to rethink the process of political subjectivation as it evolved in the “revolutionary” groups of the Left. Prisons are the unique theater for my inquiry. By intertwining historical events, prisoners’ testimonies, and prison literature, I examine anew the constitution of subjectivity that was being re-evaluated within prison as it came to impact broader social debates. My findings indicate that rather than bringing political activity to an end, the massive incarceration of militants actually converted the prison into a new site for political formation. Unpredictable folds in subjectivation developed leading to more intensified unity as well as more vigorous political critiques of the very movements to which the prisoners belonged...|$|R

50|$|Ramadi was contested {{again during}} World War II {{following}} the 1941 Iraqi coup d'état. The coup leader, Rashid Ali al-Gaylani, initiated a siege of the British base at RAF Habbaniya near Ramadi.

40|$|Introduction {{of novel}} fuels, such as {{mixtures}} of ethanol or butanol with hydrocarbons, requires new fundamental understanding of in-cylinder combustion properties in modern direct-injection spark-ignition engines since those {{can be quite}} sensitive to fuel properties. Gasoline and its blends with 25 % ethanol and butanol at 25 % and 16 % per volume (the latter equivalent to 10 % ethanol blending ratio in terms of oxygen content) were studied in comparison to gasoline, ethanol, and butanol combustion. The same alcohol blending ratios were also employed with iso-octane as the base component for direct comparison. Testing was performed at 1500 RPM with 0. 5 bar intake plenum pressure using 20 °C or 80 °C engine coolant temperature. Thermodynamic parameters were derived using in-cylinder pressure analysis for stoichiometric (ϕ = 1. 0) and lean (ϕ = 0. 83) fueling over a range of spark advances. Additionally, high speed color and greyscale chemiluminescence imaging was conducted at gasoline’s maximum <b>break</b> torque <b>spark</b> timing, calculating flame growth speeds, flame roundness, and centroid motion. Laminar burning velocity data from the literature and in-cylinder flow measurements from the same engine were used for interpretation. Overall, the analysis showed small differences between gasoline and the blends in general, but showed changes for the pure alcohols with typically much faster flame progression for ethanol and issues with the combustion stability of butanol at low engine temperatures. Alcohol blending, particularly with iso-octane, showed some benefits at lean conditions...|$|R
40|$|For almost 60 years, {{physicists}} {{have used}} strong, large-scale electric fields to accelerate charged subatomic particles. Unfortunately, these conventional particle accelerators, RF linacs, {{have reached a}} limit: at an electric field strength of about 107 V m- 1, the support structures <b>break</b> down — <b>sparks</b> fly, short-circuiting the accelerator. So, {{in order to reach}} higher particle energies one is forced to build ever larger linear accelerators, or bend the particles into a circular path using magnets (which produces another problem, as the particles then radiate away much of their energy). In theory, this electric-field problem can be overcome by plasma particle accelerators, because plasma, as an ionized medium, has already broken down and is therefore not susceptible to electron dissociation. Plasma waves can generate accelerating electric fields thousands of times greater than the most powerful conventional accelerators. And in Physical Review Letters, Amiranoff and colleagues now report 1 an experiment that brings the 'table-top' plasma accelerator a step closer to reality...|$|R
5000|$|A {{piston engine}} has {{a part of}} the {{combustion}} chamber that is always out of reach of the piston; and this zone is where the conventional spark plug is located. A Wankel engine has a permanently varying combustion area; and the spark plug is inevitably swept by the tip seals. Clearly, if a spark plug were to protrude into the Wankel's combustion chamber it would foul the rotating tip; and if the plug were recessed to avoid this, the sunken spark might lead to poor combustion. So a new type of [...] "surface discharge" [...] plug was developed for the Wankel. Such a plug presents an almost flat face to the combustion chamber. A stubby centre electrode projects only very slightly; and the entire earthed body of the plug acts as the side electrode. The advantage is that the plug sits just beneath the tip-seal that sweeps over it, keeping the spark accessible to the fuel/air mixture. The [...] "plug gap" [...] remains constant throughout its life; and the spark path will continually vary (instead of darting from the centre to the side electrode as in a conventional plug). Whereas a conventional side electrode will (admittedly, rarely) come adrift in use and potentially cause engine damage, this is impossible with a surface discharge plug, as there is nothing to <b>break</b> off. Surface-discharge <b>spark</b> plugs have been produced by inter alia, Denso, NGK, Champion and Bosch.|$|R
5000|$|When Agatha {{was five}} years old, her uncle Barry Heterodyne gave her a locket {{containing}} pictures of her parents, instructing her to never remove it. The locket secretly contained a mechanism that prevented her from realizing she was a Spark by neutralizing her early attempts to hyperfocus with excruciatingly painful migraines. Punch and Judy — constructs presumably made by her father and uncle (named for the famed medieval puppets) {{who took care of}} her under the names Adam and Lilith Clay - watchfully ensured she always wore it. Punch and Judy settled with Agatha in Beetlesburg, where Agatha attended Transylvania Polygnostic University (T.P.U.) under the direct supervision of the Spark Professor Beetle, who had been briefed on her by her Uncle, but who had his own ulterior motives. Less than a day after the locket was stolen (by von Zinzer), and in the aftermath of Professor Beetle's accidental death at the hands of Gilgamesh Wulfenbach, Agatha seemingly [...] "broke through" [...] by building her first clank while sleepwalking ("sleep-Sparking"), a quirk she continued to display for some time. Unlike most <b>Spark</b> <b>break</b> throughs, Agatha's was relatively benign in nature (Baron Wulfenbach's assistant Boris labelled her clank [...] "entertaining, but harmless"). However, through an odd turn of events (the Baron at first believed the clank to be the work of soldier and locket-thief von Zinzer), Agatha still ends up on the Baron's massive fortress airship, Castle Wulfenbach.|$|R
25|$|The primary <b>break</b> rate of <b>sparking</b> Tesla coils is slow {{compared}} to the resonant frequency of the resonator-topload assembly. When the switch closes, energy is transferred from the primary LC circuit to the resonator where the voltage rings up over {{a short period of}} time up culminating in the electrical discharge. In a spark gap Tesla coil, the primary-to-secondary energy transfer process happens repetitively at typical pulsing rates of 50–500 times per second, depending on the frequency of the input line voltage. At these rates, previously-formed leader channels do not get a chance to fully cool down between pulses. So, on successive pulses, newer discharges can build upon the hot pathways left by their predecessors. This causes incremental growth of the leader from one pulse to the next, lengthening the entire discharge on each successive pulse. Repetitive pulsing causes the discharges to grow until the average energy available from the Tesla coil during each pulse balances the average energy being lost in the discharges (mostly as heat). At this point, dynamic equilibrium is reached, and the discharges have reached their maximum length for the Tesla coil's output power level. The unique combination of a rising high-voltage radio frequency envelope and repetitive pulsing seem to be ideally suited to creating long, branching discharges that are considerably longer than would be otherwise expected by output voltage considerations alone. High-voltage, low-energy discharges create filamentary multibranched discharges which are purplish-blue in colour. High-voltage, high-energy discharges create thicker discharges with fewer branches, are pale and luminous, almost white, and are much longer than low-energy discharges, because of increased ionisation. A strong smell of ozone and nitrogen oxides will occur in the area. The important factors for maximum discharge length appear to be voltage, energy, and still air of low to moderate humidity. There are comparatively few scientific studies about the initiation and growth of pulsed lower-frequency RF discharges, so some aspects of Tesla coil air discharges are not as well understood when {{compared to}} DC, power-frequency AC, HV impulse, and lightning discharges.|$|R
