5|$|There were {{tactical}} deficiencies as well, {{particularly the}} predictability of cutting Australian signals lines just before an attack and <b>bunching</b> together in tight groups during an assault, allowing the Australians {{to take full}} toll with their machine guns. The Australian commander of the 25th Infantry Battalion, McKinna, had spread his companies out effectively and went forward to direct the fighting at several points. Fields of fire had been cleared, perimeters set and patrolling had been maintained. Nevertheless, the Australians had also failed to seize opportunities as they arose, for after the battle they did not follow up their success immediately. After {{the failure of the}} final assault, the Japanese had possessed no forces in the immediate vicinity that would have been capable of resisting any follow up forces that the Australians {{might have been able to}} bring up and it is possible that an advance could have been carried all the way to the Hongorai River. As it was, however, the Australian line of supply was stretched and it was necessary for a pause before the advance could continue in earnest.|$|E

It is analytically demonstrated that this technique can detect an rms <b>bunch</b> length under that normalized frequencies are less than 1. Such a <b>bunch</b> length monitor was fabricated for the KEKB. Design, hardware {{and the performance of}} a bunch-length monitor are described. The <b>bunch</b> length was measured both in single <b>bunch</b> and multi-bunch modes.

40|$|The Cornell Electron-Positron Storage Ring (CESR) has a {{longitudinal}} dipole-coupled-bunch instability that limits {{the total amount}} of current that can be stored in the ring without feedback. As a result, {{it is one of the}} major limitations for higher stored current and luminosity. This paper reports the measurements of multiple <b>bunch</b> longitudinal dynamics done on CESR with a streak camera. The camera was used to measure the dependence of the <b>bunch</b> distribution on current and accelerating RF voltage, for multiple <b>bunches</b> stored in CESR, as well as the effects of the longitudinal instability on the <b>bunch</b> distribution. Measurements of the beam’s longitudinal <b>bunch</b> distribution with multiple <b>bunches</b> present in the ring, help give an understanding of the instability, how it affects the <b>bunch</b> distribution, and possibly give insight into a cure of the instability. 1. Multiple <b>Bunch</b> Operations at CESR Multiple <b>bunches</b> refers to more than one <b>bunch</b> of electrons or positrons being present in CESR at one time. Multiple <b>bunches</b> in CESR are necessary to achieve high luminosity. Under present high energy physics colliding beam conditions, there are up to nine nearly evenly spaced trains of <b>bunches,</b> with up to five <b>bunches</b> in each train, for a maximum of 45 electron and 45 positron <b>bunches.</b> The <b>bunches</b> are separated at crossing points, other than the interaction point, by vertical and horizonta...|$|R
40|$|Linear accelerators {{employed}} as drivers for X-ray free electron lasers (FELs) require relativistic electron <b>bunch</b> with sub-picosecond <b>bunch</b> length. Precise <b>bunch</b> length measurements {{are important for}} the tuning and operation of the FELs. Previously, we have demonstrated that electro-optic detection is a powerful technique for sub-picosecond electron <b>bunch</b> length measurements. In those experiments, the measured <b>bunch</b> length was the average of all electron <b>bunches</b> within a macropulse. Here, for the first time, we present the measurement {{of the length of}} individual electron <b>bunches</b> using a development of our previous technique. In this experiment, the longitudinal electron <b>bunch</b> shape is encoded electro-optically on to the frequency spectrum of a chirped laser pulse. Subsequently, the laser pulse is dispersed by a grating and the spectrum is imaged with a CCD camera. Single <b>bunch</b> measurements are achieved by using a nanosecond gated camera, and synchronizing the gate with both the electron <b>bunch</b> and the laser pulse repetition rates. The electron <b>bunch</b> length is determined by measuring the laser pulse spectra with and without the presence of an electron <b>bunch.</b> We demonstrate that this method enables a real-time diagnostic for the <b>bunch</b> length of single electron <b>bunches</b> with a time resolution of 370 femtoseconds and a high signal-noise-ratio. r 2002 Elsevie...|$|R

40|$|When a {{low energy}} {{electron}} <b>bunch</b> (∼ 20 [*][*]MeV) crosses from {{top of a}} high energy <b>bunch</b> (e. g., 3  GeV) at an angle (e. g., 45 °), the Coulomb force exerted on the high energy <b>bunch</b> by the low energy <b>bunch</b> will kick a very short (∼ 150 [*][*]fs) slice from {{the core of the}} high energy <b>bunch.</b> The slice of electron <b>bunch</b> can generate ultrashort x-ray pulse. In this paper, we will give analytical expressions about the angular kicks dependence on the crossing angle by assuming a Gaussian distribution for the low energy <b>bunch.</b> Applying the analytical results to the storage ring <b>bunch</b> in NSLS-II [1], we will discuss the optimized parameters of the electron beam slicing system in order to obtain a very short slice <b>bunch</b> and a sufficient separation between the slice and the core <b>bunch...</b>|$|R

25|$|Other {{variations}} in trouser style include {{the rise of}} the trouser. This was very high in the early half of the 20th century, particularly with formalwear, with rises above the natural waist, to allow the waistcoat covering the waistband to come down just below the narrowest point of the chest. Though serving less purpose, this high height was duplicated in the daywear of the period. Since then, fashions have changed, and have rarely been that high again with styles returning more to low-rise trousers, even dropping down to have waistbands resting on the hips. Other changing aspects of the cut include the length, which determines the break, the <b>bunching</b> of fabric just above the shoe when the front seam is marginally longer than height to the shoe's top. Some parts of the world, such as Europe, traditionally opt for shorter trousers with little or no break, while Americans often choose to wear a slight break.|$|E
