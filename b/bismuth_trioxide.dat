The ETCs used were prepared both by a direct synthesis method and by cyclodepolymerization (CDP) in dilute solution. ETCs prepared exhibited a distribution of oligomeric species displaying a broad meting range, the uppermost end of which lies at 290 °C. In the case of ETCs prepared by CDP, purified ETCs (p-ETCs) were prepared by eliminating remaining impurities including linear oligomers and cyclic oligomers containing the diethylene glycol (DEG) unit using dichloromethane and tetrahydrofuran. A homogeneous mixture of ETCs prepared by the direct synthesis method or p-ETCs with antimony trioxide was successfully polymerized to high molecular weight (MW) PET (Mn 2 :: 25 000) at 293 °C within 15 min.

40|$|Background/purpose: Intraradicular {{moisture}} is not standardized and {{alters the}} sealing properties and adhesion of root sealers. The {{aim of this}} work was to evaluate the effect of different moisture on the constitution of bioceramic sealers. Materials and methods: The sealers were evaluated before mixing, and after setting using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Energy Dispersive Analysis (EDX) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) techniques. Twenty four extracted teeth were prepared and assigned to four groups according to the moisture conditions: (1) dry: using ethanol as final irrigation, (2) normal: using paper points until the last one appeared dry, (3) moist: using a Luer adapter for 5  s followed by 1 paper point, and (4) wet: the canals remained totally flooded. The roots were filled with MTA Fillapex® and Endosequence® BC and kept in phosphate buffer solution at 37  °C for 10  days. Each root was sectioned transversally and longitudinally. The sealers harvested from longitudinal sections were analysed using XRD. Whilst the transverse sections were analysed using SEM/EDX. Results: The XRD analysis showed MTA Fillapex composed of <b>Bismuth</b> <b>trioxide,</b> calcium silicate and tricalcium aluminate. The intensity of peaks in the wet condition was reduced. Endosequence BC contained mainly calcium silicate, calcium silicate hydrate, zirconia and calcium hydroxide. The wet condition showed a small increase in hydrated calcium silicate.

40|$|Chemical {{time delay}} {{detonators}} {{are used to}} control blasting operations in mines and quarries. Slow-burning Si-BaSO 4 pyrotechnic delay compositions are employed for long time delays. However, soluble barium compounds may pose environmental and health risks. Hence {{it is necessary to}} consider replacing the barium sulfate with an alternative green oxidant that has similar burn properties. Anhydrous calcium sulfate was identified as a suitable, inexpensive alternative green oxidant. The initial part of the investigation focused on characterising the burn properties of the Si-CaSO 4, as well as proposing a viable reaction mechanism for this composition. Thermochemical calculations indicated that stoichiometry corresponds to a composition that contains ca. 30 wt. % silicon (Si). Combustion was only supported in the range 30 70 wt. % Si. In this range the bomb calorimeter data and burn tests indicate that the reaction rate and energy output decrease with increasing silicon content. The compositions were filled into rigid aluminium elements and assembled into full detonators. Burn rates ranged from 6. 9 to 12. 5 mm s? 1. The reaction product was a complex mixture that contained crystalline phases in addition to an amorphous calcium silicate phase. A reaction mechanism consistent with these observations is proposed. Slow-burning Si-BaSO 4 pyrotechnic delay compositions are employed commercially for intermediate to long time delays. However, there is very little information on this composition available in the open literature. The reactivity of this composition was therefore characterised and compared with that of Si-CaSO 4. The Si-BaSO 4 composition supported combustion in the range of 20 to 60 wt. % Si in the bomb calorimeter. However, burning was only sustained between 20 and 40 wt. % Si in rigid aluminium tubes. The burn rates varied between 8. 4 and 16 mm s? 1. These values are comparable to those for the Si-CaSO 4 system (6. 9 12. 5 mm s? 1). However, the CaSO 4 -based formulations tended to have a higher energy output and produced a more pronounced transient pressure response than the barium sulfate compositions. Both the calcium sulfate- and barium sulfate-based formulations were insensitive to impact, friction and electrostatic discharge stimuli. The reaction products were a complex mixture that contained crystalline phases in addition to an amorphous phase. Although barium sulfate is insoluble in water and decidedly non-toxic, the reaction products produced by the Si-BaSO 4 compositions were found to contain water-soluble barium compounds. This ranged from 50 to 140 mg Ba per gram of barium sulfate reacted. The burn rates of delay compositions used in detonators can be modified by varying a range of parameters in addition to the stoichiometry. With this in mind, the effect of additives and fuel particle size distribution on the burn rate of the silicon-calcium sulfate pyrotechnic delay compositions was investigated. The burn rate decreased with increase in fuel particle size, while the enthalpy remained constant. The addition of fuels to a base composition of 30 wt. % Si-CaSO 4 increased the burn rate, with an increase from 12. 5 mm s- 1 to 43 mm s- 1 being recorded on the addition of 10 wt. % Al. Ternary mixtures of silicon, calcium sulfate and an additional oxidiser generally decreased the burn rate. The exception was <b>bismuth</b> <b>trioxide</b> which increased it. The Si-CaSO 4 formulation was found {{to be sensitive to the}} presence of inert material as the addition of as little as 1 wt. % of fumed silica stifled combustion in the aluminium tubes.
