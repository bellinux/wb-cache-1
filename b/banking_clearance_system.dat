30|$|The Simplified Express Consignment <b>Clearance</b> <b>System</b> (the SECCS) for aircargo was {{introduced}} in Taoyuan Airport, Taiwan, in 2001 to provide an efficient consignment clearance service for express aircargo operators. This system has booted efficiency by streamlining the declaration procedures. However, the Customs Administration (CA), customs officers, customs brokers, and consignees disagree as regards {{the effectiveness of the}} SECCS. To conduct a comprehensive analysis of the system, this study examines the SECCS operations in detail and identifies the critical influencing factors. Suggestions based on the findings are then offered to strengthen the system’s effectiveness. The research scope is expanded to cover the development and structure of the SECCS. This paper makes several contributions. First, this paper examines the CA’s development of the express consignment <b>clearance</b> <b>system.</b> Second, this paper analyzes the consignment <b>clearance</b> <b>system’s</b> effectiveness and identifies critical factors. Third, this paper provides new insights into the system flaw and examines the trade-off between the system’s efficiency and effectiveness.|$|R

40|$|Enzyme {{replacement}} therapy (ERT) {{is available for}} several lysosomal storage diseases. Except for Gaucher disease, for which an enzyme with exposed mannosyl residues targets mannose receptors (MR) on macrophages, ERT targets primarily the mannose 6 -phosphate receptor (MPR). Most recombinant lysosomal enzymes contain oligosaccharides with both terminal mannosyl and mannose 6 -phosphate residues. Effective MPR-mediated delivery may be compromised by rapid clearance of infused enzyme by the MR on fixed tissue macrophages, especially Kupffer cells. To evaluate {{the impact of this}} obstacle to ERT, we introduced the MR-null mutation onto the mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS VII) background and produced doubly deficient MR−/− MPS VII mice. The availability of both MR+/+ and MR−/− mice allowed us to study the effects of eliminating the MR on MR- and MPR-mediated plasma clearance and tissue distribution of infused phosphorylated (P) and nonphosphorylated (NP) forms of human β-glucuronidase (GUS). In MR+/+ MPS VII mice, the MR <b>clearance</b> <b>system</b> predominated at doses up to 6. 4 mg/kg P-GUS. Genetically eliminating the MR slowed plasma clearance of both P- and NP-GUS and enhanced the effectiveness of P-GUS in clearing storage in kidney, bone, and retina. Saturating the MR <b>clearance</b> <b>system</b> by high doses of enzyme also improved targeting to MPR-containing tissues such as muscle, kidney, heart, and hepatocytes. Although ablating the MR <b>clearance</b> <b>system</b> genetically is not practical clinically, blocking the MR-mediated <b>clearance</b> <b>system</b> with high doses of enzyme is feasible. This approach delivers a larger fraction of enzyme to MPR-expressing tissues, thus enhancing the effectiveness of MPR-targeted ERT...|$|R

In patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia, a discrepancy was found between subjective ear complaints and the actual middle ear function. Moreover, it appeared that for the middle ear <b>system,</b> mucociliary <b>clearance</b> is of importance only in the first 3 decades of life.

In 2000, these projectiles were used to successfully destroy a range of live underwater mines when fired from a hovering Sea Cobra gunship at Aberdeen Proving Ground. RAMICS is currently undergoing development by Northrop Grumman for introduction into the fleet. The darts of German (Heckler & Koch P11) and Russian underwater firearms, and other similar weapons are also supercavitating.|$|R
