500|$|Feeling {{as though}} he were [...] "constantly trying to prove myself", Beck {{suffered}} a backlash, with skeptics denouncing him as a self-indulgent fake and the latest marketing opportunity. In the summer of 1994, Beck was struggling and many of his fellow musicians thought he had lost his way. Combined with the song's wildly popular music video and the world tour, Beck reacted believing the attention could not last, resulting in a status as a [...] "one-hit wonder". At other concerts, crowds were treated to twenty minutes of reggae or Miles Davis or jazz-punk iterations of [...] "Loser". At one-day festivals in California, he surrounded himself with an artnoise combo. The drummer set fire to his cymbals; the lead guitarist [...] "played" [...] his char with the strings faced towards his body; and Beck changed the words to [...] "Loser" [...] so that nobody could sing along. [...] "I can't tell you how many times I was looking at faces that were looking <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with complete bewilderment—or just pointing and shaking their heads and laughing—while performing during that period," [...] he later recalled. Despite this, Beck gained the respect of his peers, such as Tom Petty and Johnny Cash, and created an entire wave of bands determined to recapture the Mellow Gold sound. Feeling his previous releases were just collections of demos recorded {{over the course of several}} years, Beck desired to enter the studio and record an album in a continuous linear fashion, which became Odelay.|$|E
2500|$|... "Ah," [...] I {{grabbed him}} by his bony shoulders, [...] "when I look at you like this, I cannot but see Charles Thomson's {{portrait}} of you, which I saw last night at The Real Turner Prize Show in Shoreditch." [...] I emphasized the word [...] "real" [...] with all my might. [...] "Yes," [...] Nick beamed <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> without even blinking, [...] "I must see it!" ...|$|E
2500|$|When Churchill's many fanciful {{strategic}} ideas {{collided with}} sound military strategy {{it was only}} Brooke on the Chiefs of Staff Committee {{who was able to}} stand up to the Prime Minister. Churchill said about Brooke: [...] "When I thump the table and push my face towards him what does he do? Thumps the table harder and glares <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> I know these Brookes – stiff-necked Ulstermen and there's no one worse to deal with than that!" [...] It has been claimed that part of Churchill's greatness was that he appointed Brooke as CIGS and kept him for the whole war.|$|E
60|$|Cleopatra {{placed her}} hands {{behind her head}} and, leaning <b>back,</b> looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with half-shut eyes.|$|R
60|$|He {{laid down}} the pen and leaned <b>back</b> to look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as it were for the first time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, not farewell," [...] {{she whispered}} <b>back,</b> looking up <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with {{eyes that were}} full of tears, though what she meant I did not know.|$|R
2500|$|Webb {{also stated}} that Deschanel's {{character}}, Summer, {{is based on a}} stock character type; [...] "Yes, Summer is an immature view of a woman. She's Tom's view of a woman. He doesn't see her complexity and the consequence for him is heartbreak. In Tom's eyes, Summer is perfection, but perfection has no depth. Summer's not a girl, she's a phase." [...] Gordon-Levitt explained that he was drawn to the role of Tom because of his relatability to the character. [...] "I've had my heart broken before. Truly, truly broken. But when I look <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in my heartbroken phase, it's pretty hilarious, because it felt so much more extreme than it really was. One of the things I love about 500 Days of Summer is that it doesn't make light of what we go through in romances, but it is honest about it and shows it for what it is, which is often profoundly funny".|$|E
2500|$|In addition, Hart {{states in}} Hitman, that while conversing with Michaels: [...] "I added, 'I also {{want you to}} know that I have no problem {{dropping}} the belt to you if that's what Vince wants.' He glared <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> 'I appreciate that, but I {{want you to know}} that I'm not willing to do the same for you.' And then he left. Jim [...] snorted, 'I can't believe that he just said that.' There was no way I could ever drop the belt to him now: he'd just shown complete disrespect not only to me, but to the position of champion..." [...] This exchange is confirmed in Dave Meltzer's account: [...] "During the meeting, Hart told Michaels that he'd be happy to put him over at the end of the run, but Michaels told Hart flat-out that he wouldn't return the favor. Michaels and Hart spoke again on the subject on 10/12 in San Jose, when once again Michaels told Hart that he wasn't going to do a job for him." [...] Additionally, in Forgiven Vince Russo stated, [...] "Well - no surprise here - Bret refused to do the job (get pinned) for Shawn in Canada. Not because he was being unprofessional - but because according to Bret, Michaels had said that he wouldn't do business with him (the right thing for the company in the ring), due to the way he felt about him." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Suddenly, I {{heard the}} clatter of Leycester's machine gun above {{the roar of the}} engine. I looked round to see what he was {{shooting}} at, and nearly had a heart attack. Slanting down from above, getting nicely into position thirty yards behind my tail, was an Albatros. [...] "I immediately heaved the old A-W round in a split-arse turn, tighter I think than I had ever turned before. I felt a flash of panic as I lost sight of the Hun, but Leycester must have been able to see him all right as he kept on firing. My sudden turn had done the trick. The Albatros overshot and suddenly appeared right in front of me. Because of the relative motion of our two aircraft, he seemed to hang motionless, suspended in mid-air. I could see the pilot's face as he looked <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> I sent a two-second burst of Vickers (machine gun) fire into him. His aircraft seemed to flutter, then slid out of sight below my starboard wing. I was pretty certain that I had hit his petrol tank. Behind me, Leycester was still blazing away. He was using tracer (incendiary bullets), and it may have been one of his bullets that ignited the petrol pouring from the Hun's ruptured tank. When I caught sight of the Albatros again, it was burning like a torch and side-slipping towards the ground, trailing a streamer of smoke. For an instant I saw the German pilot, looking down {{over the side of the}} cockpit. Then the smoke and flames enveloped him." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{threw his}} leg across it, and, sitting astride, he leaned his elbows over the <b>back</b> and glowered <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{as if he}} meant to frighten me.|$|R
6000|$|... "He started <b>back.</b> He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with cruel eyes. I saw {{a sort of}} exultant resolve {{leap into}} them--delight. Then, suddenly, with a scowl, he swept his sword back--so--and thrust." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A pretty wench you make, I {{swear by}} St. Valentine," [...] cried she, falling <b>back</b> to look <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and then coming forward to pin up {{something}} about my coif, with her white fingers.|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{from the}} door with a twinkle in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|The {{superintendent}} gazed <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a mingled look of incredulity and pity.|$|E
60|$|Limping Lucy steadied {{herself on}} her crutch and looked <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> over her shoulder.|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} what I had seen; told him in broken sentences, with gasps of pain between them, and very dexterously and swiftly he bound my arm meanwhile. He slung it from my shoulder, stood <b>back</b> and looked <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|When I came <b>back</b> {{he looked}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> carefully, and then said, [...] "You {{are not much}} the worse. Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and rest awhile, then have much breakfast and come here to me." ...|$|R
60|$|The girl shrank <b>back</b> <b>at</b> {{sight of}} <b>me,</b> {{her eyes wide}} in astonishment, and then my {{antagonist}} was upon me. I parried his first blow with my forearm, {{at the same time}} delivering a powerful blow to his jaw that sent him reeling back; but he was <b>at</b> <b>me</b> again in an instant, though in the brief interim I had time to draw my revolver.|$|R
60|$|I {{strained}} my eyes; I {{looked and}} looked. And the blank white paper looked <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> quite distressed. Tears rose at once {{into her}} eyes with true Celtic suddenness.|$|E
60|$|On {{a sudden}} I set the portmanteaus {{to the ground}} and halted. He turned and looked <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|She stood <b>back</b> {{and smiled}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> through her tears. The light of heaven {{was in that}} smile, and I have dreamed of it even since age has crept upon me. Truly, God sets his own mark on the pure in heart, on the unselfish.|$|R
6000|$|It was a wild, dismal {{stretch of}} coast. One day, I found myself there all alone--I forget {{how it came}} about--and, oh, how small I felt amid {{the sky and the}} sea and the sandhills! I ran, and ran, and ran, but I never seemed to move; and then I cried, and screamed, louder and louder, and the {{circling}} seagulls screamed <b>back</b> mockingly <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> It was an [...] "unken" [...] spot, as they say up North.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Mr. Northwick," [...] said Pinney, [...] "why don't {{you read}} your letter? If it hadn't been yours, don't I know that you'd {{have given it}} <b>back</b> to <b>me</b> <b>at</b> once?" ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the edge}} of the sea the {{creature}} paused and looked <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> Then she slid sinuously into the surf.|$|E
60|$|Then I folded my {{arms and}} stared at the statue's stony eyes, which stared <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> while all the people gasped.|$|E
60|$|For a time I {{had been}} marooned conversationally, and Lady Viping had engaged Sir Godfrey. Evidently he was {{refractory}} {{and she was}} <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Let {{me bring}} him to your picture-show," [...] pursued Zack. [...] "Judge of him yourself, before you condemn him. Surely I can't say fairer than that? May I {{bring him to}} see the pictures? Or will you come <b>back</b> <b>at</b> once with <b>me</b> to Kirk Street, where he lives?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must!" [...] said Jenny. [...] "And {{only think}} how {{different}} it is now! For the rest, whether he comes <b>back</b> for <b>me</b> <b>at</b> once, or some years hence, must depend on papa and mamma." ...|$|R
60|$|My heart failed me when I saw him {{squaring}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{with every}} demonstration of mechanical nicety, and eyeing my anatomy {{as if he}} were minutely choosing his bone. I never have been so surprised in my life, as I was when I let out the first blow, and saw him lying on his <b>back,</b> looking up <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly fore-shortened.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Only thirty, an' no odds 'tween us regardin' heads, neither. You had it <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a hop-pole. How did we {{get home}} that night? Swimmin'?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Coming <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> nothing!" [...] roared Martell; and, leaping forward, he rained a {{succession}} of blows on Fred--hitting him in the shoulder, the chest and then the left ear.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Well, {{it is of}} {{no great}} consequence, at any rate.' She smiled <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> closed my door, and {{a few moments later}} I heard her key turn in the lock." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All at once {{he stops}} short, turns round, and comes <b>back</b> {{straight}} <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> 'Ned,' says he, I am going home.' I had the good luck to sight a four-wheeler and got him in just in time. His legs were beginning to give way. In our hall he fell down on a chair, and I'll never forget father's and mother's amazed, perfectly still faces as they stood over him. They couldn't understand {{what had happened to}} him till I blubbered out, 'Maggie got drowned, yesterday, in the river.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{woman had}} not resumed her chair, but stood faltering {{with her hand}} upon its broken <b>back,</b> looking <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> I thought she would have spoken to me privately if she had dared. She was still in this {{attitude}} of uncertainty when her husband, who was eating with a lump of bread and fat {{in one hand and}} his clasp-knife in the other, struck the handle of his knife violently on the table and told her with an oath to mind HER own business at any rate and sit down.|$|R
5000|$|English translation: [...] "The it {{went out}} again and watched. I raised my hand. And the gentleman said: I've never seen a dog like this. And then the dog brought the sheep <b>back</b> and looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> to see what else I {{was going to say}}. Because it knew I was going to say {{something}} again." ...|$|R
