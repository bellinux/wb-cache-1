50|$|The {{relatively}} small chemical difference between ampicillin and benzylpenicillin not only allows for substantial oral activity but also {{results in a}} substantial broadening of antimicrobial spectrum so as to allow for use against many Gram-negative bacteria. Many devices have been employed {{in order to enhance}} still further the oral absorption of ampicillin. <b>Bacampicillin</b> is a prodrug of ampicillin designed for this purpose.An azidopenicillin sodium salt (1) is reacted with mixed carbonate ester 2 (itself prepared from acetaldehyde and ethyl chloroformate) to give ester 3. Reduction of the azido linkage with hydrogen and a suitable catalyst produces bacampillin (4). Both enantiomers are active. The drug is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is quickly cleaved by serum esterases to bioactive ampicillin, acetaldehyde, CO2 and ethanol.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bacampicillin</b> {{hydrochloride}} is an ester prodrug that is hydrolyzed to ampicillin {{after its}} absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. It was administered intragastrically at a dose rate of 13. 5 mg/kg {{of body weight}} to ponies and horses, and was highly bioavailable (F = 41. 0 %), compared with other penicillins in adult horses. The high peak ampicillin plasma concentration of 6. 1 +/- 0. 5 micrograms/ml achieved and persistence of the antibiotic at concentration of 0. 3 +/- 0. 1 microgram/ml 6 hours after its intragastric administration, suggest that <b>bacampicillin</b> hydrochloride may reach suitable bactericidal concentrations for treatment of infections caused by susceptible microorganisms. In a separate experiment, dichlorvos, an organophosphate compound that inhibits some of the esterase activity in plasma, was administered orally to the same animals at a dose rate of 40 mg/kg, followed by intragastric administration of <b>bacampicillin</b> hydrochloride at a dose of 13. 5 mg/kg. Plasma pseudocholinesterase and erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase activities were reduced to < 5 % of reference (predichlorvos) values after dichlorvos administration. However, rate of hydrolysis of <b>bacampicillin</b> into ampicillin was not affected. Consequently, the disposition and fate of <b>bacampicillin</b> when administered intragastrically 1 day after dichlorvos administration were similar to the values obtained after administration of <b>bacampicillin</b> alone. Intragastric coadministration of probenecid at a dose rate of 75 mg/kg and <b>bacampicillin</b> at 13. 5 mg/kg limited absorption of the antibiotic from the gastrointestinal tract. This suggests existence of a common transport mechanism for <b>bacampicillin</b> and probenecid in the gastrointestinal wall, and precludes use of this combination for treatment. The bioavailable fraction of ampicillin after combination treatment indicated prolonged residence time in the plasma, presumably {{as a consequence of}} reduced renal tubular secretion...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the effect of food and of a raised intragastric pH on the bioavailability of two prodrug beta-lactam, antibiotics, namely <b>bacampicillin</b> and cefuroxime axetil. Six healthy volunteers participated in an intraindividual comparison of absorption of (a) prodrug, (b) breakfast, followed by prodrug, (c) breakfast, ranitidine and sodium bicarbonate followed by prodrug, and (d) ranitidine and sodium bicarbonate, followed by prodrug. All volunteers were dosed with both <b>bacampicillin</b> and cefuroxime axetil under the above regimens. The drug-free periods between trials were 7 days. Blood samples were obtained before and 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210 min and 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10 h after administration. The urine was collected for a period of 10 h after dosing with the antibiotic. An estimation of the relative bioavailability of the drugs under the various regimens was made by comparing the average areas under the serum concentration time curves and also the amounts recovered in the urine. Both food and reduced gastric acidity decreased the bioavailability of <b>bacampicillin</b> (as ampicillin) and these variables had an additive lowering effect on the AUC and percentage urinary recovery. Possibly this ester becomes partially hydrolyzed prior to absorption on raising the intragastric pH. Adsorption onto food components or complexing with proteins may also {{play a role in the}} reduced bioavailability of <b>bacampicillin</b> in the presence of food. In contrast, the absorption of the cefuroxime ester was enhanced postprandially. This may be rationalized in terms of delayed gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit which allows more complete dissolution or prolonged residence at the most favourable site of absorption in the intestine.

40|$|Ampicillin is an {{antibiotic}} commonly administered to horses {{by both the}} intramuscular (i. m.) and the intravenous (i. v.) route.

To prolong the effects of ampicillin in the horse, {{attempts have been made}} to alter its elimination and absorption rates. The alteration of urinary pH did not change the plasma disposition of the antibiotic but when probenecid was administered concurrently with ampicillin, a significant reduction of total body clearance was achieved. Ampicillin may also be maintained in the equine body, for a prolonged period of time when administered as an i. v. infusion.

40|$|SummaryObjectivesTo {{examine the}} {{appropriateness}} of antibiotics prescribed for acute infection based on the Malaysian national antibiotic guidelines and the defined daily dose (DDD) system of the World Health Organization (WHO). This study also aimed to describe the factors influencing the drug use pattern and to investigate the procurement patterns of antibiotics in the primary healthcare setting. MethodsA retrospective cohort follow-up study of randomly selected patients from all patients who received any antibiotic between January and December 2013 was conducted at three primary healthcare clinics in Selangor State of Malaysia. For each patient, the following information was recorded: name of the antibiotic, frequency and dose, and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) group. The defined daily dose per 1000 inhabitants per day was calculated for each antibiotic. The national antibiotic guidelines {{were used to assess}} {{the appropriateness of}} each antibiotic prescription. ResultsA total of 735 patients were included in the study. The five most used antibiotics were amoxicillin (1. 36 g, 35. 2 %), cloxacillin (0. 68 g, 26. 3 %), erythromycin (0. 32 g, 22. 3 %), <b>bacampicillin</b> (0. 13 g, 7. 2 %), and cephalexin (0. 11 g, 6. 9 %). Respiratory tract infections were the most commonly treated infections, and the doctors’ preferred antibiotic for the treatment of these infections was amoxicillin. More than 18 % of all amoxicillin prescriptions were deemed inappropriate according to the national antibiotic guidelines. In terms of procurement costs, USD 88885 was spent in 2011, USD 219402 in 2012, and USD 233034 in 2013 at the three primary healthcare clinics, an average of USD 180440 per year for the three clinics. ConclusionsThis study reports the antibiotic usage at three primary healthcare clinics in Klang Province. The most prescribed antibiotic was amoxicillin in capsules (250 mg), which was mainly prescribed for respiratory infections. Although the national antibiotic guidelines state that amoxicillin is a preferred drug for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, this drug is also being prescribed for other disease conditions, such as acute pharyngitis and acute tonsillitis. This result shows that current practice is not following the current antibiotic guidelines, which state that phenoxypenicillin should be the preferred drug...|$|E
