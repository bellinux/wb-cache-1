5|$|In Tulsa, the Creek Turnpike has an {{interchange}} at Memorial Drive, {{which carries}} US-64 {{south of the}} toll road. At this interchange, Creek Turnpike traffic merges with northbound US-64 onto a free road, forming the Mingo Valley Expressway.

As the Mingo Valley Expressway (carrying US-64/US-169) turns north, the Creek Turnpike exits to continue southeast. The highway leaves Tulsa, entering Broken Arrow, where it crosses over Haikey Creek. The turnpike passes through the second toll plaza, then turns <b>back</b> <b>east.</b>|$|E

5|$|As NY22 {{continues}} north, it remains, at first, {{within a}} mile of Massachusetts, moving to the east to intersect with NY43 in Stephentown. North of that junction, it begins to run through a deep, isolated, lightly populated valley in the New York section of the Berkshires. Wide curves take the road through Berlin, where Berlin Mountain, the highest peak in the state outside of the Catskills and Adirondacks, caps the eastern skyline. Route22 trends further west, then <b>back</b> <b>east</b> to where NY2 crosses via an overpass at Petersburgh on its way to Petersburg Pass, the northernmost crossing of the New York–Massachusetts state line. The next road to head east from NY22, NY346 at North Petersburgh, enters Vermont.|$|E

They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, near the mouth of the Dulce River.|$|E

5|$|In September 1216 John began a fresh, {{vigorous}} attack. He marched {{from the}} Cotswolds, feigned an offensive {{to relieve the}} besieged Windsor Castle, and attacked eastwards around London to Cambridge to separate the rebel-held areas of Lincolnshire and East Anglia. From there he travelled north to relieve the rebel siege at Lincoln and <b>back</b> <b>east</b> to King's Lynn, probably to order further supplies from the continent. In King's Lynn, John contracted dysentery, which would ultimately prove fatal. Meanwhile, Alexander II invaded northern England again, taking Carlisle in August and then marching south to give homage to Prince Louis for his English possessions; John narrowly missed intercepting Alexander along the way. Tensions between Louis and the English barons began to increase, prompting a wave of desertions, including William Marshal's son William and William Longespée, who both returned to John's faction.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 205 {{begins at}} the bottom of I-580's eight-lane descent from Altamont Pass into the San Joaquin Valley. Here I-580 turns {{southeast}} to a junction with I-5, paralleling the California Aqueduct and Delta-Mendota Canal along the foothills, while I-205 continues east as a six-lane roadway, immediately crossing both waterways. The first interchange is with Mountain House Parkway, formerly Patterson Pass Road, which serves the planned community of Mountain House. Next is a split with Business 205, a business loop that follows 11th Street through Tracy. As I-205 curves east-northeast and <b>back</b> <b>east</b> through the northern part of Tracy, it has interchanges with Grant Line Road (County Route J4 towards Antioch), Tracy Boulevard (County Route J13 through downtown Tracy), and MacArthur Drive. After several miles without an interchange, the highway ends at a merge with I-5, where traffic can continue northeast to the junction with SR120 near Manteca and then east on SR120 towards Yosemite National Park or north on I-5 towards Stockton.|$|E

At Meridian Road, M-48 turns south along M-129 through the community of Pickford. South of town, M-48/M-129 runs long the Chippewa–Mackinac county line and crosses the Munuscong River. M-48 turns east at 26Mile Road into Chippewa County. The highway zig-zags through rural areas in the southeast of the county. It follows Hanna and 28Mile roads to Stalwart. In that community, M-48 runs south on Reynolds Road to a corner on the Chippewa–Mackinac county line where the highway turns <b>back</b> <b>east</b> toward the Goetzville area running through the Lake Superior State Forest.

5|$|Once {{it enters}} the flat Sacramento Valley, SR 20 takes a {{generally}} straight path, crossing I-5 in Williams, overlapping SR 45 near {{the west bank of}} the Sacramento River southeast from Colusa, and then turning <b>back</b> <b>east</b> to cross the Sacramento River and Sutter Bypass on its way to Yuba City. The route crosses SR 99 west of central Yuba City, and runs east through northern Yuba City to the Feather River, which it crosses on the 10th Street Bridge into Marysville. Within the central part of that city, SR 20 makes several turns, first turning south from 10th Street onto E Street, then east on 9th Street (overlapping SR 70), north on B Street, and east on 12th Street (splitting from SR 70). The highway leaves Marysville to the northeast, paralleling the Yuba River on its north side as {{it enters the}} foothills of the Sierra Nevada.|$|E
