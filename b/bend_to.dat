5|$|As the Interstate was completed, the {{highways}} that it replaced {{were removed from}} the state highway system. In 1973, the SR84 designation was removed from the highway from Gila <b>Bend</b> <b>to</b> the split where I-8 followed a new alignment southwest of Stanfield. In 1977, the US80 designation was removed from this stretch in favor of I-8.|$|E
5|$|After {{the hamlet}} of Wethersfield, NY78 {{continues}} southwest, crossing through rural farms as a two-lane roadway, intersecting with the southern terminus of CR57 (Poplar Tree Road). A short distance after CR57, NY78 intersects {{with the northern}} terminus of NY362 while winding southwest through Wethersfield. At the intersection with Maxwell Drive, NY78 becomes westbound, remaining rural for several miles. After the intersection with Irish Road, NY78 makes a gradual <b>bend</b> <b>to</b> the southwest, then north. At {{the end of this}} bend, NY78 intersects with the eastern terminus of CR54 (Chaffee Road) and the northern terminus of CR11 (East Arcade Road).|$|E
5|$|Past Sunrise Highway, {{the route}} serves many blocks of residences prior to {{entering}} a cloverleaf interchange with the Heckscher State Parkway (exit43). After this junction, NY111 continues north as a two-lane residential {{street to the}} hamlet of Central Islip. Here, the residences give way to various businesses as NY111 and Islip Avenue briefly <b>bend</b> <b>to</b> the northwest for several blocks. Another north-northwesterly stretch follows, bringing the highway over another Long Island Rail Road line, this time the Ronkonkoma Branch. Past the railroad overpass, NY111 intersects with CR100 (Suffolk Avenue), at which point NY111 leaves Islip Avenue and changes names to Joshua's Path.|$|E

50|$|SR 748 commences at its {{junction}} with SR 126 in {{the hamlet}} of Shandon. Starting {{out in a}} northwesterly direction, the highway passes through a residential neighborhood. <b>Bending</b> <b>to</b> the north, the highway enters into rural Morgan Township. The majority of SR 748 passes amid farmland, with the occasional patch of trees and numerous houses lining the roadway. After traveling due north, the highway <b>bends</b> <b>to</b> the northwest, meets Bell Road, then <b>bends</b> back <b>to</b> the north. SR 748 next <b>bends</b> <b>to</b> the northeast and then east-northeast, as it crosses Morgan-Ross Road, and into Ross Township. Following intersections with Kirchling Road and Layhigh Road, the state route <b>bends</b> back <b>to</b> the northeast, and crosses Fenton Road. The highway passes a number of houses prior to arriving at its endpoint at a T-intersection with SR 129 approximately 1/2 mi of U.S. Route 27 and the village of Millville.|$|R
5|$|Route371 {{originates}} as a {{road cut}} in1791 and later {{used for the}} Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike in1806. The new turnpike was finished in1811 and renamed as the Great Bend and Newburgh Turnpike in accordance for the extension to Great Bend, Pennsylvania. The turnpike was abandoned in1853. Route371 was originally designated along the turnpike route in1936 by the Department of Highways from Great <b>Bend</b> <b>to</b> Damascus. The route remained intact until1954, when the route was truncated back to Route171 in Herrick Center. The route was replaced by Route374 and Route848 in 1961.|$|E
5|$|CR149 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY52 {{in the community}} of Youngsville. The route progresses northward, passing and paralleling Tremper Road, a dead-end road. CR149 passes by several residential homes in Youngsville, along with one local commercial building. After leaving the community, CR149 continues to the north as Shandelee Road, passing through the residential surroundings. After passing by a few more residences, Shandelee Road makes a <b>bend</b> <b>to</b> the northwest, and into more dense woodlands in the area. About a mile north of Youngsville, CR149 continues its way northward, passing by a local residence, and intersects with Stump Pond Road, which heads westward from the main highway. Shandalee Road makes another bend, this time to the north, passing through moderate development for about another mile. A short distance into the bend, the woodlands that were surrounding the highway clear and the highway becomes surrounded by fields and residential homes.|$|E
5|$|Crossing {{over the}} west branch of Cazenovia Creek, NY240 and CR30 {{continue}} north through Concord, bending northwest into an intersection with CR563 (Foote Road). The routes bend northward through the hamlet of Footes, paralleling the creek and railroad track before entering the town of Colden. In Colden, NY240 and CR30 become a two-lane residential street surrounded by dense woods in the nearby hills. After another <b>bend</b> <b>to</b> the northwest, the routes enter the hamlet of Glenwood. In Glenwood, NY240 intersects with the western terminus of CR240 (HollandGlenwood Road), which doubles as the northern terminus of CR30, as NY240 is state-maintained north of this junction.|$|E

Leaving the town, it heads {{straight}} north until the river <b>bends</b> <b>to</b> the west, at which point the road also <b>bends</b> <b>to</b> the west and hugs the banks of the river for a mile or so until it reaches State Road 66.|$|R
50|$|The highway next curves to the northwest, {{and enters}} into an {{inverted}} U-curve, where it <b>bends</b> <b>to</b> the northeast, then, as it meets Dean Forest Road, <b>bends</b> <b>to</b> the west. SR 373 passes {{a couple of}} homes in the final stretch before it arrives at its endpoint, a T-intersection with SR 93 approximately 3 mi north of the highway's starting point.|$|R
5|$|PA848 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US11 (Main Street) in New Milford. The route runs east towards Cobb Street, making a <b>bend</b> <b>to</b> the southeast. Passing through a residential area, the route leaves the borough of New Milford {{and enters the}} township of New Milford. The surroundings become more rural, and at the intersection with State Route2061 (SR2061), the route curves to the southeast into a dense forested area. PA848 remains a two-lane road through New Milford Township. The route soon reaches SR2063 (Far Hill Road) and later with SR2081 (Oliver Road), which serves as the connection between Interstate81's (I-81) exit219 southbound and PA848. After crossing over I-81, PA848 intersects the northbound ramps {{before returning to the}} rural Gibson Township. After the intersection with Creek Road, PA848 enters the village of Gibson, where it terminates at an intersection with PA547 and Township Road574.|$|E
5|$|Past Cullen, NY167 makes {{a gradual}} <b>bend</b> <b>to</b> the northeast, passing {{by a series}} of farms {{on its way to the}} hamlet of Jordanville. Here, the highway intersects with Jordanville Road (CR18), an east–west two-lane road that NY167 briefly follows as it runs through the community. A short {{distance}} east of Jordanville, NY167 splits from Jordanville Road to head northeast as a two-lane rural road. It intersects with country roads, such as Rock Hill Road (CR 135) and Robinson Road (CR 46) For the next , the route meanders across Warren, following an erratic northeasterly course across largely undeveloped areas to reach the rural hamlet of Paines Hollow, located at the junction of NY167 and NY168.|$|E
5|$|Through Yorktown, NY129 is a two-lane {{residential}} street alongside the reservoir, soon making a gradual <b>bend</b> <b>to</b> the southeast into an intersection with County Route131 (CR131; Underhill Avenue), a former alignment of NY131. At the junction with CR131, NY129 turns southward, soon winding its way southeast under the lanes of the Taconic State Parkway, and back alongside the New Croton Reservoir. After crossing under the Taconic, the route then drops {{back down to}} the reservoir and passing a house reported to have been moved from Huntersville before it was flooded. Making several winds to the southeast, NY129 connects to the Gate House Bridge, soon running eastward through Yorktown. NY129 intersects with NY118 (Saw Mill River Road). This intersection serves as the eastern terminus of NY129, as NY118 continues east along the reservoir.|$|E

5|$|Historian Ban Zhao (45116 CE) {{wrote in}} her Lessons for Women that, like the {{opposite}} and complementary forces of yin and yang, men's great virtues were strength and rigidity, while a woman's great virtues were respect and compliance. Throughout her life, a Han woman was to <b>bend</b> <b>to</b> the will of first her father, then her husband, and then her adult son (三從四德). However, there are many recorded deviations from this rule, as some Han women are written to have engaged in heated arguments with their husbands over concubines (sometimes beating concubines out of jealousy and to punish the husband), wrote essays and letters for husbands serving as government officials, and sometimes husbands turned to their wives for advice on political affairs of the court. When a father died, the eldest son was theoretically the {{senior member of the}} family, yet as hinted in various works of Han literature, they still had to obey the will of their mother and she could even force them to kowtow to her when apologizing for an offense. Deviations from common customs regarding gender were especially pronounced in the imperial family. The empress was able to give orders to her male relatives (even her father) and if they disobeyed her, she could publicly reprimand and humiliate them.|$|E
5|$|In Quincy Newspapers' {{acquisition}} of Granite Broadcasting's remaining stations, the acquisition was briefly re-structured to have Malara Broadcast Group—which {{served as a}} virtual duopoly partner for Granite with WISE-TV (NBC) Fort Wayne and KDLH-TV Duluth (CBS), retain the stations and their current agreements with WPTA and KBJR-TV in lieu of having them sold to SagamoreHill Broadcasting. The acquisition was restructured in July 2015 to, again, have SagamoreHill Broadcasting acquire the two stations, but have their current SSAs wound down within nine months. Following {{the end of the}} SSA, the two stations retained The CW as independently-run stations, with their remaining affiliations moved to subchannels of KBJR and WPTA. Quincy similarly wound down an SSA in Peoria, Illinois with Sinclair-owned WHOI by acquiring rights to its ABC and CW programming, and moving them to subchannels of WEEK-TV, in exchange for giving up its Fox affiliation for WSJV-TV in South <b>Bend</b> <b>to</b> Sinclair's WSBT-TV.|$|E
5|$|Most {{anthozoans}} are opportunistic predators, catching prey which drifts {{within reach}} of their tentacles. The prey is secured {{with the help of}} sticky mucus, spirocysts (non-venomous harpoon cells) and nematocysts (venomous harpoon cells). The tentacles then <b>bend</b> <b>to</b> push larger prey into the mouth, while smaller, plankton-size prey, is moved by cilia to the tip of the tentacles which are then inserted into the mouth. The mouth can stretch to accommodate large items, and in some species, the lips may extend to help receive the prey. The pharynx then grasps the prey, which is mixed with mucus and slowly swallowed by peristalsis and ciliary action. When the food reaches the coelenteron, extracellular digestion is initiated by the discharge of the septa-based nematocysts and the release of enzymes. The partially digested food fragments are circulated in the coelenteron by cilia, and from here they are taken up by phagocytosis by the gastrodermal cells that line the cavity.|$|E

Making a large <b>bend</b> <b>to</b> the southeast, NY157 crosses into John Boyd Thacher State Park, passing multiple entrances and parking lots into various park attractions. Through the park, NY157 makes various directional changes, but maintains a generally southeast progression, crossing {{into the town}} of New Scotland within the park grounds. After leaving the park, the route retains the Thacher Park Road moniker, winding southeast through dense wilderness of New Scotland. Turning to the south, NY157 junctions with the terminus of CR311 (Beaver Dam Road). After one more <b>bend</b> <b>to</b> the east, the route intersects with NY85 (New Scotland Road). This junction, located in the hamlet of New Salem, serves as the eastern terminus of NY157.|$|E
