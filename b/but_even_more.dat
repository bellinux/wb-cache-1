5|$|Coonley died in 1958; ACS {{had looked}} to Coonley for her {{leadership}} {{over the years}} <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> so for her philanthropy. ACS began charging tuition in 1929, but still relied on Coonley's financial support, and her death caused serious financial hardship. Under the direction of newly appointed headmaster John Malach, a summer program was launched in 1960, open to all children from the surrounding area, to increase revenues and visibility. A swimming pool was added in 1961 to bolster the program. Enrollment had declined {{over the years and}} Malach marketed the program aggressively, personally interviewing prospective students. In 1964 enrollment again reached 200 students, which brought in additional tuition and much needed financial stability.|$|E
5|$|No skin {{impressions}} {{have ever}} been found in association with fossils of Deinonychus. Nonetheless, {{the evidence suggests that}} the Dromaeosauridae, including Deinonychus, had feathers. The genus Microraptor is both older geologically and more primitive phylogenetically than Deinonychus, and within the same family. Multiple fossils of Microraptor preserve pennaceous, vaned feathers like those of modern birds on the arms, legs, and tail, along with covert and contour feathers. Velociraptor is geologically younger than Deinonychus, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> closely related (within the subfamily velociraptorinae, see Classification, below). A specimen of Velociraptor has been found with quill knobs on the ulna. Quill knobs are where the follicular ligaments attached, and are a direct indicator of feathers of modern aspect.|$|E
5|$|Oh Aij Tjeng {{is a young}} ethnic Chinese man {{who runs}} a {{plantation}} in West Java. He lives there with his njai (concubine), a Sundanese woman named Marsiti. The two are deeply in love and promise to be faithful forever. However, not long afterwards Aij Tjeng's father Oh Pin Loh comes to tell Aij Tjeng {{that he has been}} betrothed to Gwat Nio, the daughter of the plantation's owner Liok Keng Djim. Marsiti is sent away by the elder Oh and, after Aij Tjeng orders his manservant Tirta to find her, Tirta disappears as well. After the marriage, Aij Tjeng finds in Gwat Nio all of the same traits which made him fall in love with Marsiti, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> polished owing to her better education. He falls in love with her and begins to forget Marsiti, and the couple have a daughter, Lily.|$|E

5|$|In Baxter's eyes, {{the main}} {{role of the}} {{university}} was to provide trained engineers and technologists for industry, which he believed was suffering from a critical skill shortage. With this constantly in mind, he pursued a rapid expansion of the university. Student numbers grew from 3,751 when he became vice-chancellor in 1955, to over 15,988 when he retired in 1969. This was {{far short of the}} university of 25,000 students that he had hoped to create, but in the 1950s the idea of a university that large horrified some academics. Baxter considered it wasteful when good students returned to academia after only a brief time working in industry, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> so when they dropped out or failed their courses. While his critics saw high failure rates as the inevitable result of lowering admission standards in order to boost student numbers, Baxter viewed it as result of poor teaching and inefficient administration. He walked out of a heated Staff Association meeting on the matter. To help industry, he established Unisearch Limited, a company that provided expert assistance in 1959.|$|E

25|$|The pulp format {{declined}} from rising expenses, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> {{due to the}} heavy competition from comic books, television, and the paperback novel. In a more affluent post-war America, the price gap compared to slick magazines was far less significant. In the 1950s, men's adventure magazines began to replace the pulp.|$|E

25|$|A {{comparable}} <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> remarkable, yet effectual, use {{of natural}} ultramarine is in The Girl with a Wineglass. The shadows of the red satin dress are underpainted in natural ultramarine, and, owing to this underlying blue paint layer, the red lake and vermilion mixture applied over it acquires a slightly purple, cool and crisp appearance that is most powerful.|$|E
25|$|The scene {{changes to}} the outside of the tomb of Ninus. Sémiramis announces her {{intention}} to remarry: her choice is Arzace. This horrifies Azéma, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> so the high priest Oroès, who has recognised that Arzace is really Sémiramis' lost son Ninias. The ghost of Ninus appears and proclaims that Arzace will reign in Babylon, but only after he has descended into the tomb to avenge Ninus' death.|$|E
25|$|George {{reconciled}} {{the issues}} of efficiency and equity, showing that both could be satisfied under a system in harmony with natural law. He showed that Ricardo's Law of Rent applied not just to an agricultural economy, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> so to urban economics. And he showed {{that there is no}} inherent conflict between labor and capital provided one maintained a clear distinction between classical factors of production, capital and land.|$|E

25|$|On {{his return}} to France he spent three years with the Chastaigners, {{accompanying}} them to their different châteaux in Poitou, as the calls {{of the civil war}} required. In 1570 he accepted the invitation of Jacques Cujas and proceeded to Valence to study jurisprudence under the greatest living jurist. Here he remained three years, profiting not only by the lectures <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> by the library of Cujas, which filled no fewer than seven or eight rooms and included five hundred manuscripts.|$|E
25|$|Some {{evidence}} {{also points}} to local civilian opposition {{to the presence of}} the Force Intervention Brigade. According to Teddy Muhindo Kataliko, president of the Civil Society in Beni Territory, “The population is very hostile to MONUSCO. Firstly because so many people are being killed, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> so seeing all their arsenal, logistics and soldiers in the area.” This opposition stems from the civilian deaths caused by the Force Intervention Brigade, as well as the failure of the Brigade to eliminate most rebel groups despite long term presence in the region.|$|E
25|$|The Company had {{obtained}} Parliamentary powers {{to merge with}} the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway (GP) in 1847, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> alarming revelations of financial impropriety emerged regarding that company, and the Caledonian considered getting authorisation to cancel the amalgamation. However it was later decided to proceed, and the amalgamation took place by Act of Parliament of 7 August 1851. The GP operated the line between Glasgow and Paisley jointly with the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G), and the Paisley line used a terminus at Bridge Street, in Glasgow.|$|E

25|$|Durif, or Petite Sirah, is a {{descendant}} of Syrah and Peloursin. It was propagated by and named after Dr. Francois Durif. Durif is a cross breed between the lesser known Peloursin and Syrah. Regions such as Rutherglen have achieved international regard for their Durif. This varietal is similar to Shiraz, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> full bodied and tannic because of the smaller, thicker skinned grapes used. Petite Sirah is widely planted in California, where it is popular as a varietal (for example, by Bogle Vineyards), and especially blended with Zinfandel, which results in a rich, bold and fruity wine.|$|E
25|$|In summer 1942, {{supplies}} on the British occupied Mediterranean {{island of}} Malta were running desperately low. There were acute food shortages, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> serious {{was the lack}} of aviation fuel, needed to sustain the dozens of fighter aircraft defending the island against German Luftwaffe and Italian Regia Aeronautica bombing attacks. It was later said that Malta would have been forced to surrender in only sixteen days if fuel had not got through. The British conceived a plan to resupply Malta using fourteen merchant ships escorted by a vast armada of Royal Navy warships; four aircraft carriers, two battleships, seven cruisers and thirty-two destroyers.|$|E
25|$|On the {{international}} level, the interwar period was characterised by {{an attempt to}} put Luxembourg on the map. Especially under Joseph Bech, head of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the country participated more actively in several international organisations, {{in order to ensure}} its autonomy. On December 16, 1920, Luxembourg {{became a member of the}} League of Nations. On the economic level in the 1920s and the 1930s, the agricultural sector declined in favour of industry, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> so for the service sector. The proportion of the active population in this last sector rose from 18 percent in 1907 to 31 percent in 1935.|$|E

25|$|Isabella was {{a refined}} and {{intelligent}} woman {{who liked to}} be surrounded by artists and poets. She was a generous patron of the arts. In politics, she had a great influence on her son, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> so on her husband, whom she represented on several diplomatic conferences and for whom she governed when he was absent. Most notably, she negotiated many of the marriages of the members of her court, among them the marriage of her son Charles to Catherine of France. She also took special pains on behalf of Mary of Guelders, who attended upon Catherine. Isabella helped arrange her marriage to James II of Scotland, which would make her queen.|$|E
25|$|Freight {{services}} to King's Lynn were less swiftly, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> extensively, affected by cutbacks. Campbell's made heavy use of rail transport after opening its factory in Lynn in 1959, its curtain-sided wagons {{being one of}} the more distinctive sights on the Fen Line; but with the withdrawal of Speedlink services in the early 1990s, this traffic was lost to road transport. The branch to the harbour was progressively shortened before its final closure at around the same time, and the line to the docks closed as well (except for a short stub allowing the aforementioned freight trains from Middleton to change direction), the last train passing over the line in June 1994. The station's once-extensive goods yard suffered the same fate, the site being taken over by the station's car park and two large shops.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of the 20th century brought {{the start of a}} revolution in physics. The long-held theories of Newton were shown not to be correct in all circumstances. Beginning in 1900, Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr and others developed quantum theories to explain various anomalous experimental results, by introducing discrete energy levels. Not only did quantum mechanics show that the laws of motion did not hold on small scales, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> disturbingly, the theory of general relativity, proposed by Einstein in 1915, showed that the fixed background of spacetime, on which both Newtonian mechanics and special relativity depended, could not exist. In 1925, Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger formulated quantum mechanics, which explained the preceding quantum theories. The observation by Edwin Hubble in 1929 that the speed at which galaxies recede positively correlates with their distance, led to the understanding that the universe is expanding, and the formulation of the Big Bang theory by Georges Lemaître.|$|E
50|$|Myreton Hill is {{not quite}} as high as its {{neighbour}} Dumyat, from which it is separated by the deep Menstrie Glen, <b>but</b> although <b>even</b> <b>more</b> easily accessible than Dumyat in terms of gradients and paths, it is much less popular, being visually far less distinctive than its neighbour.|$|R
