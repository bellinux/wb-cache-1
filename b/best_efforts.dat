40|$|The future {{high-speed}} networks {{will need}} to support diverse traffic and provide services to flows with Quality of Service (QoS) requirements {{as well as to}} <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> flows. In this paper we analyze the coexistence of the QoS and <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> flows from the routing and scheduling point of view. We concentrate in our routing and scheduling analysis on the network bandwidth resource. We present two sets of source routing algorithms: (1) the bandwidth-constrained routing with imprecise state information for QoS flows, and (2) the maxmin fair routing for <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> flows. The routing analysis includes an extensive description of various algorithms in their domains and their complexity discussion. Furthermore, we discuss two level hierarchical scheduling which is tailored towards the needs raised by the coexistence of QoS and <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> flows. We show that this scheduling design accomplishes two design goals (1) guaranteeing QoS for QoS flows and (2) ensuring fairness for <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> flows [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> traffic {{delivery}} in 802. 11 e contention-based networks. Differently from most previous paper which focus on the support of quality of service (QoS) requirements, we study the tuning of the access parameters for the <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> traffic. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we discuss the coexistence between legacy DCF and EDCA stations, since, for guaranteeing the backward compatibility, the <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> service class defined in EDCA should correspond to the legacy DCF. We show what configurations of the access parameters are closer to the DCF protocol, by taking into account the slightly different backoff rules defined in EDCA. Second, we explore the optimizations that can be performed by dynamically tuning the access parameters, on a per-beacon basis, in the case of homogeneous <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> sources. We propose an effective algorithm able to maximize the system throughput, by adapting the minimum contention window to the network contention level. Finally, we analyze the amount of resources available for <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> traffic in presence of QoS traffic. We show that the dynamic adaptation of the minimum contention window {{as a function of the}} channel wasted times can be a valid solution to automatically regulate the <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> offered load in the network...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this thesis, we {{consider}} resource allocation schemes for infrastructure-based multipoint-to-point wireless networks like IEEE 802. 16 networks and infrastructure-less ad-hoc networks. In the multipoint-to-point networks, we propose channel and Transport layer aware uplink scheduling schemes for both real-time and <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> services, whereas in ad-hoc networks, we propose channel aware congestion control schemes for <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> services. We also evaluate {{the performance of}} IEEE 802. 16 networks by conducting various experiments in the current deployed IEEE 802. 16 networks of a leading telecom operator in India. The results of our experiments motivate us to further investigate scheduling schemes specific to real-time and <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> services...|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{availability}} of sophisticated network quality of service (QoS) guaranteeing mechanisms, it is apparent {{that a large number of}} applications will continue using the <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> service class. The main reason for this is that the QoS guaranteeing mechanisms are complex and many applications are not capable of using these complex services. At the same time, the standard <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> service is rather unpredictable and hence insufficient for many applications. Thus augmenting <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> services to an appropriate standard without incurring a high level of complexity is necessary. In this paper, two such augmentations are described in the context of the UBR service of ATM networks. Selective packet discarding is used to achieve the necessary goals...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} interactions among flow-level performance metrics when integrating QoS and <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> flows in a wireless system using opportunistic scheduling. We in-troduce a simple flow-level model capturing the salient features of bandwidth sharing for an opportunistic scheduler which ensures a mean throughput to each QoS stream for every time slot. We then explore the flow-level performance showing that integration of QoS and <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> flows results in loss in opportunism, {{which in turn}} results in a reduction of the stability region, degradation in system throughput, and increased file transfer delay. These losses are shown to be proportional to opportunistic gains, the guaranteed bandwidth and number of QoS flows, but inversely proportional to SNR under a Rayleigh fading channel model. In an integrated system exploiting opportunism, local instability {{appears to be more}} severe than in wired networks and average delays experienced by <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> flows are prolonged. We suggest that a form of admission control for <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> flows is necessary to avoid local instability, and ensure adequate performance. I...|$|R

5|$|When light {{falls from}} above on a uniformly {{coloured}} three-dimensional object {{such as a}} sphere, it makes the upper side appear lighter and the underside darker, grading {{from one to the}} other. This pattern of light and shade makes the object appear solid, and therefore easier to detect. The classical form of countershading, discovered in 1909 by the artist Abbott Handerson Thayer, works by counterbalancing the effects of self-shadowing, again typically with grading from dark to light. In theory this could be useful for military camouflage, but in practice it has rarely been applied, despite the <b>best</b> <b>efforts</b> of Thayer, and later, in the Second World War, of the zoologist Hugh Cott.|$|E

At 03:45, however, a new ship emerged from the darkness, soon revealed to be the British frigate HMS Arethusa. Arethusa was deployed as part of the force blockading the ports of Northern Spain and her commander, Captain Robert Mends, was a successful officer who had been commended just two weeks earlier for raiding the French-held port of Lekeitio. Mends immediately pulled alongside Niémen and Dupotet fired a single shot each at Amethyst and Arethusa. The shot at Amethyst missed its target, but the one at Arethusa struck the ship and threw up splinters. Mends was struck on the forehead and badly wounded, the only man to be hit. Both Amethyst and Arethusa then opened fire, Niémen surrendering immediately.|$|E

Immediately after receiving the first letter, Pauline began making preparations for her departure from Pisa, in order to reach her son at Frascati. Before this was possible, she became aware of the truth and her suspicions were confirmed by de la Ronde.|$|E

5|$|Despite the <b>best</b> <b>efforts</b> of {{his father}} to secure a {{favorable}} venue, judge, and defense team, on January 31, 1825, the jury convicted Isaac Desha of murder and sentenced him to hang. Rowan immediately requested a new trial upon grounds of jury interference, and Shannon granted the request on February 10. Jury selection proved problematic, occupying at least parts of four terms of the Harrison County Circuit Court. In September 1825, a jury was finally empaneled. The judge, Harry O. Brown, had been temporarily appointed to his position by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy. Desha was again found guilty, and sentenced to hang on July 14, 1826. Judge Brown overturned the verdict because the prosecution had not proven that the murder took place in Fleming County, as alleged in the indictment against Desha. The state argued that this was of no consequence, since a change of venue had already been granted, but the judge's ruling stood, and Governor Desha's reputation took a further hit.|$|E
