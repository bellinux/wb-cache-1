25|$|The {{line between}} Møhlenpris and Torgallmenningen was created when line 2 was split in 1919. After some time, the city centre {{terminus}} {{was moved to}} Ole Bulls plass. After numerous changes, in 1923 it was extended to Tyskebryggen ("the German Dock"). In 1950, the line was replaced by Bergen's first trolleybus line, which ran along through the new street from Dokken to Nøstet, not along the tram line from Møhlenpris over Nygårdshøyden to the city centre. It continued to Bryggen and Mulen, where it replaced the bus route from Nøstet to Mulen. This <b>bus</b> <b>section</b> was replaced by diesel bus in 1994 as it was started to build a western approach and split into two different lines, 5 Mulen-Solheimslien and 11 Møhlenpris-Nygårdshøyden-Starefossen. In connection with another restructuring the line 11 had its route changed to Nordnes instead of Møhlenpris, and Southern Møhlenpris lost its bus connection in 2000. The stretch between Møhlenpris and Engen is still in operation as a museum tram.|$|E

The communication processor is a paradigm {{for the control}} of such a bus by means of software. Synchronous communication takes place within the tiles of a SoC in the deep sub-micron technology domain. We explore design alternatives for a linear software-controlled <b>sectioned</b> <b>bus</b> while building the hardware model of a single-instruction-issue processor, and run, in simulation, a media benchmark on it. We determine the energy cost of controlling this bus, compare it with the energy gain obtained from the sectioning, and find it favorable. The control cost is only 5 % of the bus transport energy, leaving us with a gain by segmentation of 81 %. We demonstrate the feasibility of the control of a low-power synchronous communication system by the processor. Starting out from this case study at the low-end to medium range of network complexity, we consider the implications of growing complexity that will arise from using multiple sectioned buses on multiple-issue computers (VLIWs). We find that control of linear bus topologies of medium-level complexity is now well understood. Further work is needed at the high-end of non-linear topologies...|$|R

Also, the simple bus protection functions of 35 kV and 10 kV buses are constructed based on the GOOSE information on the protection starting and operation of each bay. According to circuit breaker operating mode in the substation, one zone of transformer backup protection operation logic is added: if this logic judges that the bus coupler (or <b>bus</b> <b>sectioning)</b> CB is in trip state before protection tripping, the time delay of tripping circuit breakers at both sides of transformer will be shortened.|$|R

50|$|Okutama Shinkō is {{the company}} which Ome Electric Railway Co. {{established}} in 1928 by setting development of an area along the railroad line as the main purpose. The first bus line in Ome and Okutama area is between Futamatao Station (destination station of Ome Electric Railway of those days) and Hatonosu Station which was started operation by Okutama Jidōsha Co. in 1922. Ome Electric Railway purchased the Okutama Jidōsha in 1930, and it extended to Hikawa (Oku-Tama Station) in August of the same year. Although the railroad section of Ome Electric Railway was nationalized (present JR Ome Line) and the <b>bus</b> <b>section</b> operated by Ome Electric Railway succeedingly in April, 1944, all the bus enterprises of the Ome Electric Railway were transferred to the Okutama Shinkō, its subsidiary in April, 1946.

40|$|Introduction During {{the last}} decade, applications, {{especially}} distributed ones, {{have become more}} and more complex. One of the reasons of this fact, is that the number of system and network functionalities (for communication, fault tolerance, mobility, replication, etc.) to be included, has constantly increased. On the other hand, development environments (operating systems, software communication buses, programming languages) are rapidly changing, and put some stringent requirements on developers. Our response to this challenge is a multi-language, hardware independent, execution platform, called the virtual virtual machine (VVM). The genuine characteristic of this platform is to be dynamically extensible and adaptable to each application's needs. After {{a brief description of the}} VVM project in Section 2, this position paper provides some insights on the capabilities of the VVM in terms of reflective features (Section 3), and communication <b>bus</b> (<b>Section</b> 4).

40|$|Introduction This paper {{describes}} {{the architecture of}} a multiprocessor, called Hector, which exploits current microprocessor technology to produce a machine with good cost/performance tradeoff. A key design feature of Hector is an interconnection backplane that scales well with technology. This is achieved with simple hardware that has short critical paths in logic circuits and short lines in the interconnection network. The result is a system characterized by good performance, reliability and flexibility, which can be realized at a relatively low cost. An important aim of the Hector project is to develop an architecture suitable for construction of a general-purpose multiprocessor, where the cost is directly proportional to the size so that a low-cost entry-level machine is economically feasible, yet is scalable to larger sizes. In order to easily accommodate configurations with varying numbers of processors, Hector has a hierarchical structure. It features small <b>bus</b> <b>section...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{fault level}} rating of {{installed}} equipment {{in urban areas}} is a common restriction on the expansion of distributed generation (DG). One option for reducing fault level is to split the network at selected points by, for example, opening <b>bus</b> <b>section</b> circuit breakers that are normally run closed. This paper presents studies performed to evaluate the impact of network splitting on fault levels and various network performance measures such as reliability and power quality. Four generic test networks were used that reflect typical operating conditions and configurations of UK distribution networks, although the results are generally applicable to other networks. The studies provide valuable guidance on the potential benefits and costs of network splitting and so contribute to the debate on how to accommodate more DG on existing networks. Other issues like network operation and maintenance {{must also be considered}} when assessing if a particular network splitting option is acceptable from both a network and generation perspective...|$|E

5000|$|The New York Connecting Railroad was {{electrified}} around 1927 as {{an extension}} of the New Haven's system. The NYCR system encompassed 20 route miles (32 km) of track, and was electrified, like the New Haven, using overhead catenary at 11 kV, 25 Hz. The system received power from the New Haven Cos Cob Power Station and Consolidated Edison 201st generating station via the West Farms substation. Additional power was supplied from a 5 MW, 7 kVA, 11 kV, three-phase to single-phase converter installed at East New York. This unit was also operated in synchronous condenser mode for reactive power support. (See Amtrak's 25 Hz traction power system.)Like the New Haven, the NYCR traction power was distributed using the 2 x 11 kV autotransformer topology. Two wires, the feeder and the catenary (often called the trolley wire), carried voltage of 11 kV to ground, but of opposite phase such that the feeder and catenary were 22 kV phase-to-phase. Six autotransformer stations, spaced an average of 3.8 miles apart along the line, converted power. Each station contained oil circuit breakers for both feeder and trolley buses, <b>bus</b> <b>sectioning</b> switches, and one [...] 3 MVA outdoor autotransformer.|$|R
