5|$|At {{about six}} {{o'clock in the}} morning, some of the protesters {{discovered}} a small gate to the palace was unguarded. Making their way inside, they searched for the queen's bedchamber. The royal guards raced throughout the palace, bolting doors and <b>barricading</b> hallways {{and those in the}} compromised sector, the cour de marbre, fired their guns at the intruders, killing a young member of the crowd. Infuriated, the rest surged towards the breach and streamed inside.|$|E
5|$|On 13 March, {{violence}} {{erupted in}} the Bekkersdal township in Gauteng, the scene of violent service delivery protests in 2013. Residents staged a protest over a planned ANC campaign in the area, <b>barricading</b> the streets with rocks and burning tyres and pelting ANC officials and police vehicles with stones. Police responded to the volatile situation by firing rubber bullets at residents.|$|E
5|$|In the Second World War, the 2nd Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment and the 4th Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry held Cassel {{for three}} days {{as part of the}} {{defensive}} screen around Dunkirk during the Battle of Dunkirk and evacuation (27 May 1940 – 30 May 1940). The British forces had prepared a defence on the hilltop, emplacing anti-tank guns and <b>barricading</b> the narrow streets of the town. After scoring initial successes against the tanks of Panzer Regiment 11, which had made the mistake of advancing without infantry support, the British garrison was heavily attacked from the ground and the air by German forces. Much of the town was reduced to ruins by bombing. Most of the garrison's members were killed or captured by the Germans during the fighting or the subsequent attempted breakout towards Dunkirk, but the defence they had put up {{played an important role in}} holding up the Germans while the Dunkirk evacuation was taking place.|$|E

50|$|<b>Barricade</b> {{returned}} in Transformers: The Last Knight, having survived and being kept under surveillance for {{years since the}} battle of Chicago. <b>Barricade</b> is first seen spying on a war torn area of Chicago, discovering Cade Yeager who gained the talisman, in turn meaning Quintessa and Cybertron were approaching to the Earth. <b>Barricade</b> reported this back to Megatron, who demanded they find the talisman, and <b>Barricade</b> suggested they {{make a deal with}} the TRF. <b>Barricade,</b> along with the other Decepticons hunted down the Autobots, but <b>Barricade</b> was incapacitated by Grimlock and forced to retreat. <b>Barricade</b> later appeared in London, pursuing Bumblebee, Yeager and Viviane until Bumblebee blasted him, and collided with a truck. <b>Barricade</b> later joined with Megatron and Nitro Zeus at Stonehenge when they began helping Quintessa draining power from Earth/Unicron. <b>Barricade</b> fought back against the English military, but was not seen again.|$|R

5|$|The first open {{clash between}} the mutineers and {{officers}} {{came on the}} morning of 3 December, when a small group of sailors gathered on the forecastle and, refusing orders to leave, began to argue with the officers. Captain Eyles asked to know their demands, which were an assurance that Temeraire would not go to the West Indies, but instead would return to England. Eventually Rear Admiral Campbell came down to speak to the men, and having informed them that the officers did not know the destination of the ship, he ordered them to disperse. The men went below decks and the incipient mutiny appeared to have been quashed. The ringleaders, numbering around a dozen, remained determined however, and made discreet inquiries among the rest of the crew. Having eventually determined {{that the majority of the}} crew would, if not actually support a mutiny, at least not oppose it, and that the Temeraires crew would be supported by the ship's marines as well as the crews of some of the other warships in Bantry Bay, they decided to press ahead with their plans. The mutiny began with the crew closing the ship's gunports, effectively <b>barricading</b> themselves below deck. Having done so, they refused orders to open them again, jeered the officers and threatened violence. The crew then came up on deck and once again demanded to know their destination and refused to obey orders to sail for anywhere but England. Having presented their demands they returned below decks and resumed the usual shipboard routine as much as they could.|$|E
5|$|On November 23, 2008 at Survivor Series, Edge {{returned}} to WWE after an introduction by SmackDown General Manager and his on-screen wife Vickie Guerrero, replacing Jeff Hardy in the Triple Threat {{match for the}} WWE Championship involving champion Triple H and Vladimir Kozlov. He pinned Triple H to become the WWE Champion {{for the third time}} in his career. The following month, Edge lost the title to Hardy at Armageddon in a Triple Threat match, which also featured Triple H. At the Royal Rumble, however, Edge regained the title in a no disqualification match, following Matt Hardy's interference. At the February event No Way Out, Edge lost the WWE title in an Elimination Chamber after being pinned by Jeff Hardy, being the first to be eliminated, with the title eventually being won by Triple H. Later that night, Edge inserted himself into the World Championship Elimination Chamber match after attacking Kofi Kingston and <b>barricading</b> himself inside one of the Chamber's pods, proceeding to win his eighth World Championship, last eliminating Rey Mysterio and taking the title over to SmackDown. At WrestleMania XXV in April, Edge lost the championship to John Cena in a Triple Threat match, which also included The Big Show. Three weeks later he regained the championship at Backlash, when he defeated Cena in a Last Man Standing match, after interference by The Big Show. After a successful defense against Jeff Hardy at Judgment Day, he lost the title to Hardy at Extreme Rules in a ladder match, and afterwards said some disparaging things to his on-screen wife, Vickie Guerrero. While Hardy was celebrating, CM Punk cashed in his money in the bank and defeated Hardy to win the World Heavyweight Championship. The following night, Guerrero resigned as the Raw General Manager due to being humiliated, and Edge came out to apologize. Instead, however, he claimed he married Guerrero because she had authoritative powers as the General Manager, and sought a divorce.|$|E

After a number of hours, the group eventually ended their protest, and were arrested by police.|$|E
25|$|UP Diliman {{became the}} bastion of {{activism}} in the 1960s and 1970s, with various tumultuous events eventually {{contributing to the}} declaration of Martial Law in 1972. In this period, UP Diliman became a center of dissent towards the Marcos' administration. The year 1971 marked an important event in the Philippine history when the entire Diliman campus was declared the Diliman Commune, and became free from government control. Students and faculty members took over the campus in response to increasing military presence and the increase of oil prices. The students established full control of the campus for a month, <b>barricading</b> the streets with chairs and tables.|$|E

25|$|That Tuesday night, many {{residents}} around East Ninth street were alarmed and {{called into the}} Gazette and News that they believed more murders had been committed because they heard sirens. The sirens {{turned out to be}} sound effects from a carnival. Guard dogs became a hot commodity in local want-ads. Terrified wives would not go out after dark. In addition to arming and <b>barricading</b> themselves, residents took to extreme measures, such as creating booby-traps, installing lights, and even temporarily moving into hotels or relative's homes, for safety in numbers. Overnight watches were kept, and tensions were high, with police questioning anyone who appeared suspect.|$|E
25|$|Two {{years after}} the church was consecrated, in 1863, St Pancras {{was the target of}} a series of anti-Catholic riots. This led to the curate <b>barricading</b> himself in the presbytery for two days after {{disturbances}} during Guy Fawkes night. The riot was suppressed only when the Mayor of Ipswich enrolled 200 special constables, although the riots were credited with creating sympathy for the church and the Catholic community among local dignatories. In 1871 the church became a separate parish, for the first ten years under the care of the Pallottines, an Italian order. In 1885 St Pancras merged with St Mary's to become a single parish, this time based in the more central St Pancras.|$|E

25|$|The {{uprising}} {{began on}} 9 December, in the Jabalia refugee camp after an Israeli Defense Forces' (IDF) truck {{collided with a}} civilian car, killing four Palestinians. In {{the wake of the}} incident, a protest movement arose, involving a two-fold strategy of resistance and civil disobedience, consisting of general strikes, boycotts of Israeli Civil Administration institutions in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, an economic boycott consisting of refusal to work in Israeli settlements on Israeli products, refusal to pay taxes, refusal to drive Palestinian cars with Israeli licenses, graffiti, <b>barricading,</b> and widespread throwing of stones and Molotov cocktails at the IDF and its infrastructure within the West Bank and Gaza Strip.|$|E
25|$|Thursday May 9, 1968, strike leaders, {{including}} sanitation {{crew chief}} Joe Savage, encouraged sanitation workers {{to return to}} work. That morning, over 100 sanitation workers reported to the sanitation department. 35 workers had come with the anticipation to work, while others showed up to protest. Police Sergeant Ray Stewart had also come to the sanitation compound along with other officers equipped with riot gear. At approximately 7:10a.m., the first of five garbage trucks attempted to leave the compound under police escort, but was met with a human blockade of protesters <b>barricading</b> the exit. At the advice of attorney James Sanderlin and crew chief Joe Savage, the protesters allowed three trucks to exit. A fourth and fifth truck were eventually able to leave without further incident at 7:28a.m. The five garbage trucks collected garbage from businesses, schools, and hospitals while most residential trash continued to go uncollected.|$|E
25|$|In {{the morning}} of only the second day, a {{rebellion}} broke out among the volunteer prisoners. They ripped off their uniforms and locked themselves in their cells by pushing their beds up against the door. In response to this, the guards became very angry and called for backup. This surprised Zimbardo {{as well as the}} rest of the psychologists because they had not thought it would be taken this far. Guards who were not on duty were called in and the guards who were assigned to only the night shift stayed with the guards who came in all the way through their shift the next morning. The tactic the guards came up with was to fight back in order to discipline the unruly prisoners and make them obey. In response to the prisoners <b>barricading</b> themselves in their cells, the guards used fire extinguishers on them to get them away from the entrances.|$|E

25|$|On 25 June, with La Argentina {{still in}} port, a sailor struck {{one of his}} superiors, an act of insubordination. When Bouchard {{discovered}} this he ordered the sailor's arrest, provoking general unrest. One of the fellow sailors attacked Commander Sommers, who killed him in self-defense. This did not prevent {{other members of the}} crew from <b>barricading</b> themselves inside the ship, which led their being forcibly removed by the marine infantry, led by Sommers. Two crewmen were killed in the conflict, and four others were wounded. Following the altercation Echevarría sent a letter to Supreme Director Juan Martín de Pueyrredón explaining that the incident {{was the result of the}} crew having been stuck in Buenos Aires for an extended period, and that chances of further outbreaks would be lessened once the ship put to sea. Two days later La Argentina headed to Ensenada de Barragán, which started rumors flying that Bouchard had deserted the service. In reality, the frigate disembarked under the authority of a general order which required ships that were subjected to loading delays and such but were otherwise seaworthy leave the harbor in order that they not be caught at anchor should the Spanish attempt an invasion.|$|E
25|$|Vang Pao moved three battalions {{back into}} a fertile rice growing area, the Muong Ngan valley. Next, he {{received}} reinforcements from the Royal Lao Army. With the 103rd Bataillon Parachutiste (103rd Parachute Battalion) added to the irregulars, the combined force moved down from their hill position to Phonsavan on 29 April. In {{the ruins of the}} town smashed by artillery and air strikes, they found two BTR-40 Armored Cars, 18 other vehicles, 12 37mm antiaircraft guns, and a 75mm howitzer, which they destroyed. Continuing through town two kilometers to the northwest, {{on the north side of}} Route 4 they uncovered a cave complex crammed with pre-positioned communist supplies. Behind barrels of rocks <b>barricading</b> cave entrances against air attack, they found 300 tons of medical supplies. Another cave contained hospital beds for 1,000 patients. Still another contained over a mile of supplies within it; as the cache was too big to ruin, local Buddhist monks were convinced to lay a curse upon it so the superstitious Pathet Lao would not reclaim the goods. There were operating theaters; one had a pair of X-ray machines. Air America flew in a cargo of varied explosives to destroy the goods. The 1,000 Hmong troops occupied Phonsavan for the first time since 1962; they did not have to fire a shot.|$|E
25|$|While {{living in}} Rome in the 380s, Ammianus wrote a Latin {{history of the}} Roman empire from the {{accession}} of Nerva (96) {{to the death of}} Valens at the Battle of Adrianople (378), in effect writing a continuation of the history of Tacitus. He presumably completed the work before 391, as at 22.16.12 he praises the Serapeum in Egypt as the glory of the empire; it was in that same year the Emperor granted the temple grounds to a Christian bishop, provoking pagans into <b>barricading</b> themselves in the temple, plundering its contents, and torturing Christians, ultimately destroying the temple. The Res Gestae (Rerum gestarum Libri XXXI) was originally composed of thirty-one books, but the first thirteen have been lost (historian T.D. Barnes argues that the original was actually thirty-six books, which if correct would mean that eighteen books have been lost). The surviving eighteen books cover the period from 353 to 378. As a whole it is extremely valuable, constituting the foundation of modern understanding {{of the history of the}} fourth century Roman Empire. It is lauded as a clear, comprehensive, and generally impartial account of events by a contemporary; like many ancient historians, however, Ammianus was in fact not impartial, although he expresses an intention to be so, and had strong moral and religious prejudices. Although criticised as lacking literary merit by his early biographers, he was in fact quite skilled in rhetoric, which significantly has brought the veracity of some of the Res Gestae into question.|$|E
