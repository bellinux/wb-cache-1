They moved quickly to add manufacturing capacity to what would otherwise have <b>been</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> sales organisation: in December 1934 the company took over Cornelius Redman & Sons, renaming it Churchill-Redman Ltd. The facility was used initially to manufacture American machine tools under licence, rather as the machine tool company had started out in the early 1900s. A particularly notable example of its output was the licence granted in 1937 by Jones & Lamson of Springfield, Vermont, for the Fay automatic lathe. It {{was to become a}} pattern for Gabriel to orchestrate take-overs of other companies but not subsume them: they would have their own management team and retain a separate corporate identity.|$|E

500|$|Part of {{what made}} reform {{possible}} in Britain {{in the second}} half of the eighteenth century was the dramatic increase in publishing; books, periodicals, and pamphlets became much more widely available than they had <b>been</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few decades earlier. This increase in available printed material helped facilitate the rise of the British middle class. Reacting against what they viewed as aristocratic decadence, the new professional middle classes (made prosperous through British manufacturing and trade), offered their own ethical code: reason, meritocracy, self-reliance, religious toleration, free inquiry, free enterprise, and hard work. They set these values against what they perceived as the superstition and unreason of the poor and the prejudices, censorship, and self-indulgence of the rich. They also helped establish what has come to be called the [...] "cult of domesticity", which solidified gender roles for men and women. This new vision of society rested on the writings of Scottish Enlightenment philosophers such as Adam Smith, who had developed a theory of social progress founded on sympathy and sensibility. A partial critique of the rationalist Enlightenment, these theories promoted a combination of reason and feeling that enabled women to enter the public sphere because of their keen moral sense. Wollstonecraft's writings stand at the nexus of all of these changes. Her educational works, such as her children's book Original Stories from Real Life (1788), helped inculcate middle-class values, and her two Vindications, A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790) and A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), argue for the value of an educated, rational populace, specifically one that includes women. In her two novels, [...] and , she explores the ramifications of sensibility for women.|$|E
500|$|The next {{race was}} the Breeders' Cup Classic on November 1. Because many leading older horses retired in 2014, {{most of the}} main contenders for the 2014 Classic were the three year olds: in {{addition}} to California Chrome, former foes Bayern, Candy Boy and Tonalist entered. His chief rival {{was considered to be}} the then-undefeated American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt, Shared Belief, a gelding who missed the Triple Crown series due to hoof problems; the two had never faced each other. California Chrome was 4-1 on the morning line, second favorite to Shared Belief. In the race, Bayern bumped into Shared Belief at the start, then took the lead {{for the duration of the}} race. California Chrome was clear of traffic, maintained third place for most of the race, was closing at the end, and finished a very close third, only a neck behind winner Bayern, who won by a nose over second-place finisher Toast of New York. Shared Belief was fourth. Post race analysis noted that California Chrome stayed on the outside throughout the race, and actually ran 44 feet farther than the winner. [...] Sherman spoke in positive terms of the horse's finish, stating, [...] "My horse ran his eyeballs out. He was right there, right down to the money. I thought it was a great effort. He came back strong." [...] Espinoza was less enthusiastic: [...] "On the backstretch I thought I had a chance to win... The last sixteenth [...] was digging as hard as he could, but getting just a little tired. I wish he had one more race. It was a little too much for him today."

2500|$|When Foreman and Ali {{finally met}} in the ring, Ali began more aggressively than expected, outscoring Foreman with {{superior}} punching speed. However, Ali quickly realized that this approach required him to move much more than Foreman and would cause him to tire. In the second round, Ali retreated to the ropes, shielding his head and hitting Foreman in the face at every opportunity. Foreman dug vicious body punches into Ali's sides; however, Foreman was unable to land many big punches to Ali's head. The ring ropes, being much looser than usual (Foreman later charged that Angelo Dundee had loosened them, and this story is supported by Norman Mailer in the book The Fight), allowed Ali to lean back and away from Foreman's wild swings and then grab Foreman behind the head, forcing Foreman to expend much extra energy untangling himself. Ali also constantly pushed down on Foreman's neck but was never warned about doing so. To this day, {{it is unclear whether}} Ali's pre-fight talk of using speed and movement against Foreman had <b>been</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> diversionary tactic or whether his use of {{what became known as the}} [...] "rope-a-dope" [...] tactic was an improvisation necessitated by Foreman's constant pressure.|$|E
2500|$|Cnut's brother Harald {{may have}} been at Cnut's coronation, in 1016, {{returning}} to Denmark as its king, with part of the fleet, at some point thereafter.

This is not conclusive, though, for the entry {{may have been}} made in Harald's absence, perhaps by the hand of Cnut himself, which means that, while it is usually thought that Harald died in 1018, it is unsure whether he was still alive at this point.

Of course, this may have <b>been</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> gesture for a soul to be under the protection of God. There is evidence Cnut was in battle with pirates in 1018, with his destruction of the crews of thirty ships, although it is unknown if this was off the English or Danish shores.

2500|$|Before the Anglo-German summit at Berchtesgaden on 15 September 1938, the British Ambassador, Sir Nevile Henderson, and Weizsäcker {{worked out}} a private {{arrangement}} for Hitler and Chamberlain to meet with no advisers present {{as a way of}} excluding the ultra-hawkish Ribbentrop from attending the talks. Hitler's interpreter Paul Schmidt later recalled that it was [...] "felt that our Foreign Minister would prove a disturbing element" [...] at the Berchtesgaden summit. In a moment of pique at his exclusion from the Chamberlain-Hitler meeting, Ribbentrop refused to hand over Schmidt's notes of the summit to Chamberlain, a move that caused much annoyance on the British side. Ribbentrop spent the last weeks of September 1938 looking forward very much to the German-Czechoslovak war he expected to break out on 1 October 1938. Ribbentrop regarded the Munich Agreement as a diplomatic defeat for Germany, as it deprived Germany of the opportunity to wage the war to destroy Czechoslovakia that Ribbentrop wanted to see; the Sudetenland issue, which was the ostensible subject of the German-Czechoslovak dispute, had <b>been</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> pretext for German aggression. During the Munich Conference, Ribbentrop spent much of his time brooding unhappily in the corners. Ribbentrop told the head of Hitler's Press Office, Fritz Hesse, that the Munich Agreement was [...] "first-class stupidity… All it means {{is that we have to}} fight the English in a year, when they will be better armed… It would have been much better if war had come now". Like Hitler, Ribbentrop was determined that in the next crisis, Germany would not have its professed demands met in another Munich-type summit, and that the next crisis to be caused by Germany would result in the war that Chamberlain had [...] "cheated" [...] the Germans out of at Munich.|$|E
