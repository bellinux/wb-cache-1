Patent branch vessels originating from the false lumen in a type B aortic dissection {{are assumed to}} contribute to persistent blood flow and patent false lumen. Therefore, the morphologic changes of the false lumen generated by different outflow rates in an in vitro model were investigated. MethodsAn artificial dissection was created in two ex vivo porcine aortas. A thin cannula {{was placed in the}} false lumen, simulating a <b>branch</b> <b>vessel</b> originating from it. The aorta was positioned in a validated in vitro circulatory system with physiological pulsatile flow (1, 500 – 2, 700 mL/minute) and pressure characteristics (130 / 70  mmHg). The cannula was attached to a small silicone tube with an adjustable valve mechanism. Three different valve settings were used for creating outflow from the false lumen (fully closed, opened at 50 %, and fully opened at 100 %). Measurements of lumen areas and flow rates were assessed with time-resolved magnetic resonance imaging. In order to study reproducibility, the experiment was performed twice in two different porcine aortas with a similar morphology. ResultsIncreasing antegrade outflow through the <b>branch</b> <b>vessel</b> of the false lumen resulted in a significant (p < . 01) increase of the mean false lumen area at the proximal and distal location in both models.

The question addressed was whether endovascular treatment with multilayer flow modulator stents (MFMS) {{can be considered a}} safe alternative to open surgery for high-risk patients with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA). Altogether 27 papers were identified using the reported search, of which 11 represented the {{best evidence}} to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study limitations are tabulated. The outcomes of interest were all-cause survival, aneurysm-related survival, <b>branch</b> <b>vessel</b> patency and major adverse events. Aneurysm-related survival exceeded 78 % in almost all studies, {{with the exception of one}} where the MFMS was inserted outside the instructions for use. In that study the aneurysm-related survival was 28. 9 %. The <b>branch</b> <b>vessel</b> patency was higher than 95 % in 10 studies and not reported in one.

However, a number of limitations must be considered when interpreting this evidence, particularly the complete lack of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), short follow-up in all studies, and heterogeneity of the pathologies among the different populations studied.

40|$|An {{intracranial}} aneurysm, abnormal {{swelling of}} the cerebral artery, may lead to undesirable rates of mortality and morbidity upon rupture. Endovascular treatment involves the deployment of a flow-diverting stent that covers the aneurysm orifice, thereby reducing the blood flow into the aneurysm and mitigating the risk of rupture. In this study, computational fluid dynamics analysis is performed on a bifurcation model to investigate the change in hemodynamics with various side branch diameters. The condition after the deployment of a pipeline embolization device is also simulated. Hemodynamic factors such as flow velocity, pressure, and wall shear stress are studied. Aneurysms with a larger side <b>branch</b> <b>vessel</b> might have greater risk after treatment in terms of hemodynamics. Although a stent could lead to flow reduction entering the aneurysm, it would drastically alter the flow rate inside the side <b>branch</b> <b>vessel.</b> This may result in side-branch hypoperfusion subsequent to stenting. In addition, two patient-specific bifurcation aneurysms are tested, and the results show good agreement with the idealized models.

40|$|Background: Nonspecific aorto{{arteritis}} (NSAA) or Takayasu′s arteritis is {{an inflammatory}} disorder of large elastic arteries. Imaging plays {{a vital role}} in the diagnosis and treatment of such patients. Hence, one {{should be aware of the}} imaging profile of NSAA, and the advantages and disadvantages of computed tomography angiography (CTA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA), which are the two most commonly performed imaging investigations in these patients. Aims: The aims of this study were to evaluate the imaging profile of NSAA in a sub-group of the Indian population, and to compare the efficacy of CTA and DSA in the diagnosis of this entity. Materials and Methods: A prospective study was conducted with 25 patients, who underwent CTA and DSA for suspected NSAA in our institute between January 2009 and September 2010. The data was analyzed in terms of the demographic characteristics of the study group, most common artery involved, most common angiographic type of NSAA, and the CTA and DSA findings in the study group. Results: NSAA predominantly affects young females, as seen in this study, wherein 20 of the 25 patients were females (80 %). The most common age group affected was 20 - 25 years. Most of the patients (44 %) had involvement of more than two vessels. The most common aortic <b>branch</b> <b>vessel</b> to be involved was the renal artery. DSA was more sensitive than CTA in detecting aortic or <b>branch</b> <b>vessel</b> stenosis. However, CTA scores over DSA in the evaluation of vessel wall thickness. Conclusion: The imaging profile of NSAA in the Indian population is different from the Japanese population in that the most common <b>branch</b> <b>vessel</b> involved in the Indian population is the renal artery, as opposed to the subclavian artery in the Japanese population. CTA and DSA are both very effective in the diagnosis of NSAA. However, the best imaging modality in NSAA is DSA since it can be used for diagnosis as well as the treatment of NSAA...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundStents are {{increasingly}} {{used in the}} endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. We studied the effects of stenting and endothelial denudation on aneurysm and <b>branch</b> <b>vessel</b> occlusion. MethodsBilateral lingual bifurcation venous pouch aneurysms were created in eight dogs, surgically scraping the aneurysmal endothelial lining on one side. Both arteries were immediately stented using balloon-expandable stents. In four other dogs, a wide-neck carotid bifurcation aneurysm was created, with the vein pouch denuded or not (n = 2 each), followed by immediate stenting. Results were compared using angiography and pathology at 10 days (n = 2), 10 (n = 8), and 20 weeks (n = 2). Branch occlusion between initial and final angiograms was recorded. Pathological evaluation of aneurysms was studied, with attention to neointima formation at the aneurysm ostium and around <b>branch</b> <b>vessel</b> origins. ResultsAll stented and denuded lingual aneurysms were obliterated compared with two of eight lingual aneurysms that were stented alone (P =. 007). None of the carotid bifurcation aneurysms became obliterated (0 / 4), but denuded aneurysms showed partial thrombosis (2 / 2). Of 68 total stent-covered branches, 5 (7 %) were occluded and 17 (27 %) had altered angiographic flow. ConclusionsStenting led to suboptimal results {{in the presence of}} an intact endothelial layer. Endothelial denudation can promote aneurysm occlusion when combined with stenting.

Stents {{are increasingly}} deployed as part of the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, but pose risk to perforating vessels crossed by the stent. The mechanism whereby some aneurysms become permanently occluded while other aneurysms recur remains unknown. This study tests the effects of stenting with and without endothelial denudation on rates of aneurysm healing and <b>branch</b> <b>vessel</b> occlusion.

40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{examined}} the flow behavior of four stent graft configurations for endovascular repair of complex aneurysms of the descending aorta. MethodsComputational fluid dynamics models with transient boundary conditions and rigid wall simplifying assumptions were developed and used with four distinct geometries to compare various near-wall hemodynamic parameters. ResultsGraphic plots for time-averaged wall shear stress, oscillating shear index, and relative residence time were presented and compared among the four stent graft configurations of interest. ConclusionsAbrupt 90 ° and 180 ° changes in stent geometry (particularly in the side branches) cause a high momentum change and thus increased flow separation and mixing, which has significant implications in blood flow characteristics near the wall. By comparison, longer bridging stents provide more gradual changes in momentum, thus allowing blood flow to develop before reaching the target vessel.
