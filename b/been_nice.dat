Issued on 6 August 2007, the single included the radio edit of the song and Ellis-Bextor's cover of [...] "Duel" [...] by Propaganda. Ellis-Bextor stated that she released the song because [...] "it {{was important to me}} with this single to push boundaries a little bit and part of that is explore a few musical directions that are a bit more unexpected, so it's <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> to release a ballad".|$|E

He took a [...] "session approach" [...] to the album, [...] "trying {{as much as possible}} to create parts that fit what Jim et al had created, versus trying to impose anything upon it". He was sent MIDI bass parts for each song which served as a guideline.

The faculty members capture the two agents, convinced {{that they need to}} perform a sacrifice to regain favor with the Devil and make up for their diluted faith before it is too late. As they are about to kill Mulder and Scully, Mrs. Paddock causes them to instead kill themselves, confirming that their attempt was indeed too late. The agents escape their bonds and find Mrs. Paddock missing, with only a parting message on the chalkboard stating, [...] "Goodbye. It's <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> working with you." ...|$|E
500|$|Krause {{deemed the}} revelation of Adele's moving on [...] "an {{interesting}} twist, with unexpected repercussions", whereas Stevens' offering Bailey the money to open the free clinic, was negatively reviewed; looked upon as the most predictable event of the episode. Krause noted that both medical cases were confusing, assessing that [...] "it would have <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> {{to learn more about}} the severe dehydration that caused the runner's legs to swell." [...] In addition, Krause explained how the Amish angle was unexpected, but significantly helpful to the entertainment level, while a lack of realism in the medical case was highlighted: [...] "No one bothered to really mention that it would have <b>been</b> <b>nice,</b> had it been caught earlier. It was, but she allowed herself to deteriorate." [...] The fight between Grey and Shepherd was deemed [...] "a tiff that Derek was entirely responsible for", but also a proof of [...] "how damaged Meredith really is". Krause expressed disappointment in the storyline involving O'Malley proposing to Torres: [...] "Callie certainly didn't look thrilled. If she believes George is proposing as a means to get over his grief, she's probably right and should likely run in the opposite direction." [...] Considering each of the attending physcians' chances of becoming the chief of surgery, Krause noted the possibility of Sloan being chosen as [...] "hilarious, but a tad unbelievable", whereas assessing that Montgomery's [...] "great traits" [...] might suffer, due to her relationship with Karev, which was described as [...] "certainly bringing into question her ability to stay on the straight and narrow". Krause characterized the whole as [...] "one of those guilty pleasures that many may not admit to".|$|E
500|$|It was {{the absence}} of Symonds, sent home from the 2008–09 series against Bangladesh for {{skipping}} a team meeting to go fishing, that gave White another opportunity in the ODI team. Although stand-in captain Clarke mirrored the action of Ponting by bringing himself on before the Victoria captain, White claimed a career-best three wickets for five runs off the 10balls he bowled. After the match, White admitted he had to prove he could deal with the pressures of international cricket, but was upbeat, saying [...] "it was nice {{to get a few}} wickets but it would have <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> to get a few overs under the belt as well." [...] He claimed two more wickets in the second match and, after not being required to bowl in the third, finished the series with an average under 10.|$|E

500|$|... "Die Hand Die Verletzt" [...] {{was written}} by Glen Morgan and James Wong, who were co-executive {{producers}} for the series as well as writers. The episode originally stemmed from an idea of Glen Morgan's to have a scene where a snake eats a man. [...] Series creator Chris Carter described the episode as [...] "a cautionary tale about playing with fire, playing with things bigger and badder than you might imagine". In an interview, he also praised the purposefully clashing tones of the entry, noting that it begins almost comical, with the PTC saying Satanic prayers and toads raining from the skies. However, as it goes on, it becomes increasingly dark. Morgan and co-writer James Wong left the series after this episode to produce the series [...] The line written by Mrs. Paddock on a chalkboard {{at the end of}} the episode, [...] "It's <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> working with you," [...] also acted as a goodbye to the crew of the show. The two later returned to the show in the fourth season.|$|E
500|$|His {{first goal}} of 2011–12 {{came with the}} winner in Grimsby's 1–0 away win over Forest Green Rovers on 3 September 2011 after capitalising on a {{defensive}} mistake. Coulson was handed a one-match suspension after accumulating five yellow cards, missing the home match against Newport County on 19 November. He made an immediate return to the Grimsby line-up, starting in their 1–0 home win over League Two team Port Vale in the FA Cup first round on 22 November 2011. His first two-goal haul of the season came in a 3–0 victory at home to Darlington in the FA Trophy first round on 10 December 2011, scoring Grimsby's first and third goals. It was announced on 23 April 2012 that Coulson had rejected a new two-year contract on reduced terms with Grimsby, meaning he would leave the club {{at the end of}} the season. Having been left out of the squad for Grimsby's final two matches of the season, Coulson spoke that he was saddened by the manner of his departure, saying [...] "It would have <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> to go out on a high". He finished his final season at Grimsby with 52 appearances and 10 goals.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} features {{introduced to}} the game received a mixed response. IGN noted that the Special Games varied in quality between different games, with Casamassina commenting that [...] "they certainly don't make or break the experience." [...] The game's [...] "Power Shots" [...] was also met with an ambivalent reaction—the shot themselves were praised for adding strategy and character, although GameSpot's Ryan Davis commented that [...] "it would have <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> {{if you could just}} skip past the animations and keep the wild moves." [...] In general, the game's multiplayer modes were more popular than single-player, with the [...] "predictable and basic" [...] artificial intelligence contributing to a low difficulty level at times. GameSpy noted how the number of options and variables enhanced the multiplayer experience, and commented that [...] "The game is very good on its own, but it excels when you bring friends into the mix." [...] The mechanics of the tennis gameplay were also popular, with reviewers lauding the game's accessibility as well as its depth relating to the variety of shots available and how the position of the character affects the contact with the ball.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, MTV Unplugged {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. Ryan Jones from Alternative Addiction gave the album four stars out of five, writing that [...] "the final product has been touched up perfectly {{and the four}} songs on the EP are the perfect selections."

IGN called this mode fun in its review of , but complained {{that it would}} have <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> if the developers had {{come up with a new}} game to replace it. Their review of [...] criticizes it more so than in the review of Super Mario Advance 2 because Nintendo chose not to add multiplayer to any of the mini-games found in that game, sticking instead with an identical version of the Mario Bros. game found in previous versions. GameSpot's review of [...] calls it a throwaway feature that could have simply been gutted. Other reviewers were not as negative on the feature's use in later Super Mario Advance games. Despite its use being criticized in most Super Mario Advance games, a GameSpy review called the version found in Super Mario Advance 2 a blast to play in multi-player because it only requires at least two Game Boy Advances, one copy of the game, and a link cable.|$|E

Kenseth's victory gave his team Roush Fenway Racing its first win in the Gatorade Duels. Kenseth said, [...] "Jimmie Johnson gave me a huge push there and really worked nice for me the whole race. Without that push it never would've got there. Greg lost his {{drafting}} partner. We were able to separate him and the #78 [...] and we had such a big run that Greg {{was kind of a}} sitting duck." [...] Second-place finisher Smith stated while he would have preferred to win the race, he did not have any complaints, [...] "It’s good to know that we have a car capable of running up front." [...] Johnson, who finished third, said, [...] "It was an awesome race. We really had a shot to win that one. It was unfortunate there at the end that there were some lapped cars that were kind of mixed in with the leaders.

500|$|Sunderland {{opened the}} month with a 1–0 defeat away to Manchester United on 1 September, Louis Saha scored the winner 18minutes from full-time. Roy Keane said [...] "I'm {{delighted with the}} overall performance. It would have <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> to test their goalkeeper a bit more but overall I'm delighted with the players' efforts." [...] about the team's display. Jack Pelter signed for Sunderland on 8 September, from New Zealand team Canterbury United, on a free {{transfer}} in an original one-month deal. Two weeks after the defeat to Manchester United, Sunderland beat Reading 2–1 on 15 September. Kenwyne Jones and Ross Wallace scored the Sunderland goals in a game which was overshadowed by the tribute paid to 1973 FA Cup Final scorer Ian Porterfield who died on 11 September 2007. Sunderland met Middlesbrough on 22 September in their first north east derby of the season. Grant Leadbitter scored in the 2nd minute to put Sunderland in front, but two ex-Sunderland players; Julio Arca and Stewart Downing put Middlesbrough into the lead.

500|$|Benfica opened March {{with the}} quarter-finals of the Portuguese Cup. They played Beira-Mar {{at home and}} won 1–0 with a goal from João Pereira in the 25th minute. Trapattoni {{analysed}} the game, saying, [...] "Everybody knew this match was an revenge for the league defeat. In the first half we dominated, in the second we were dominated. Beira-Mar was fresher – {{it is not easy}} to play every three days. Still, we deserved to win." [...] Three days later, on 6 March, Benfica played at Estádio da Madeira against Nacional and won 1–0 with a goal from Nuno Gomes. Near the end, Quim brought down Wendel Geraldo inside the box but failed to convert the penalty, hitting the woodwork. Trapattoni praised his team's commitment saying their victory was deserved and they were lucky with the missed penalty. On 12 March, Benfica played at home against Gil Vicente. With the chance to open a three-point lead over Porto, Benfica won 2–0 with an opening goal from Mantorras and a second from Miguel. After the game, Trapattoni argued with a fan after the second goal; he said, [...] "I argued with a fan, not fans. I was not nice to him, but since the first game, he has not <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> to me." [...] He added that the win was very important and that Benfica had not won anything yet. Benfica closed March with an away game against Vitória de Setúbal. Benfica's Manuel Fernandes scored first, with Geovanni doubling the lead in the second half in a 2–0 win.|$|E
500|$|United manager Ferguson also praised Dudek's {{performance}} in the match: [...] "Their goalkeeper has won them the game, sometimes {{you just have to}} put your hands up on these occasions. Dudek has won them the cup. He deserved to be man of the match. We didn't get a break. Dudek's performance encouraged them to stay near their penalty box. In tough games like that the first goal is very important. It's a test for us. We can either accept defeat or we can fight back." [...] Captain Keane was disappointed with the defeat: [...] "The players, managers, staff are all upset but I suppose nowhere near as bad as the fans, if you don't win a match in football you feel as though you have let the fans down." [...] His focus turned to United's participation in the UEFA Champions League, as they looked to end the season with a trophy: [...] "It would have <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> {{to get a piece of}} silverware in the cabinet, especially with the opposition being Liverpool, we've just got to lick our wounds. We've got a game against Leeds on Wednesday and we'll get on with training for Wednesday. The players know we'll have to get together, get ready and try to keep the pressure on Arsenal. But we are eight points behind them, which puts them in a very strong position and again we are pinning our hopes on the European Cup, which is a dangerous game to play as we saw last season." ...|$|E
