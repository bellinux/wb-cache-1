Recent advancements in {{friction}} stir welding (FSW) {{technology and}} pin (probe) tool design for aluminum have made FSW applications in aerospace and automotive structures quite attractive. FSW {{has the potential for}} better fit, form and function when compared to fusion welding. The aim of this research was to design, develop and fabricate a fixture to meet the requirement of a standard automotive impact test on an FSW bumper/crash-box assembly. A fusion welded bumper/crash-box design was provided to Wichita State University (WSU) by the General Motors Corporation (GM). For this case study, the bumper design was not changed, but the existing crash box was altered to satisfy two FSW assembly designs, incorporating unique lap and hybrid welds for the closeout area {{at each end of the}} bumper. Both designs use a common butt weld along a nested interface between the crash box and the bumper. The goal of this test fixture was to facilitate a dynamic vehicle test on FSW bumpers and compare the test results to that of fusion-welded bumpers. Functional use of FSW in bumper design was to be determined through this case study. Since the test fixture uses similar type welds as the bumper geometry, FSW was also incorporated into the test fixture design. Several design constraints related to vehicle testing, FSW and the University Impact Laboratory were met. Process simulation of dynamic forces on the bumper and test fixture welds, along with standard static analysis, were used for design verification. Parameter bounding and test coupons of FSW in aluminum were used to determine parent and weld material properties as well as optimum weld parameters for manufacturing the test fixture. Aluminum alloys 6063 -T 6, 6061 -T 6, 7050 -T 7451, concrete and structural fusion welded steel were selected for materials in the test fixture design. A linear <b>bearing</b> <b>rail</b> system was used to facilitate the gravity-fed drop tower and dynamically fed sled test function...|$|E

40|$|An on-car brake lathe resurfaces disk-brake rotors by {{rotating}} them "in place" {{and making a}} light cut along {{the surface of the}} disk. The primary goal of this thesis is to develop an automated cutting head for an on-car brake lathe. The new cutting head must produce a surface finish that matches or exceeds that of the current (manual) cutting head. Pro-Cut International, a leading manufacturer of on-car brake lathes, developed functional requirements and cost constraints for the automated cutting head. Technical challenges include design and fabrication of low-cost precision linear bearings and actuators with dynamic stiffness sufficient to suppress chatter. During this thesis, two prototype cutting heads were designed, manufactured, and tested. The first prototype employed modular linear bearings, and produced unacceptable surface finish due to chatter. Cutting-tip vibration measurements combined with modal testing showed that chatter was caused by low structural stiffness of the modular <b>bearing</b> <b>rails.</b> A second prototype employing a unitary ground bearing system produced an acceptable surface finish of 70 [mu] -inch at 0. 015 " depth of cut per side. The key components of this design can be extruded and sliced to form the assembly, thereby meeting cost constraints. by Andrew Kirk Wilson. Thesis (S. M.)

Torrington was among the pack charging that Asian and European bearing producers were selling bearings below their manufacturing cost, an illegal practice that carried into the early 1990s.|$|R
50|$|The way {{upon which}} the train ran {{consisted}} of a single iron girder 4 feet in depth for each span, placed over the center line of the posts. The girder carried an upper track beam and a lower track beam, upon the sides of each of which the rails, four in number, were placed. The two <b>bearing</b> <b>rails,</b> which carried the load of the train, consisted of angle irons placed upon the outer upper edge of wooden stringers upon the lower track beam. These stringers {{were placed in the}} exterior recesses formed by two channel bars properly secured to the sides of the posts. These rails were fastened to each other, to the stringers, and to the track beam by bolts passing clear through. Two vertically placed rails for the balancing or friction wheels were carried by the upper track beam. The distance from out to out between the lower rails was 22½ inches, this being sufficient to insure the necessary transverse stiffness. This was the gauge of the road. The distance between the upper rails was 17½ inches. It was expected to adopt the common form of rail, beveling the edges of the lower stringers and placing the rail at an angle of about 45 degrees. The rails were {{in the form of a}} right angle, and the treads of the wheels were made with a corresponding right angle groove. The usual length of post, 24 feet, would give a clear headway of 14 feet, 4 feet being taken up by the truss and 6 feet forming the foundation.|$|R

Like a conventional ball bearing, the proposed bearing would include an inner and an outer ring separated by balls in rolling contact with the races. However, unlike a conventional ball bearing, the balls would not roll in semi-circular or gothic arch race grooves in the rings: instead, the races would be shaped to form two or more rails (see figure). During operation, the motion of the balls would push dust particles into the spaces between the rails where the particles could not generate rolling resistance for the ball...|$|R

40|$|Applied Technology Associates, Inc., (ATA) has {{demonstrated}} that inertial actuation can be employed effectively in digital, active vibration isolation systems. Inertial actuation {{involves the use of}} momentum exchange to produce corrective forces which act directly on the payload being actively isolated. In a typical active vibration isolation system, accelerometers are used to measure the inertial motion of the payload. The signals from the accelerometers are then used to calculate the corrective forces required to counteract, or 'cancel out' the payload motion. Active vibration isolation is common technology, but the use of inertial actuation in such systems is novel, and is the focus of the DAMPER project. A May 1991 report was completed which documented the successful demonstration of inertial actuation, employed in the control of vibration in a single axis. In the 1 degree-of-freedom (1 DOF) experiment a set of air <b>bearing</b> <b>rails</b> was used to suspend the payload, simulating a microgravity environment in a single horizontal axis. Digital Signal Processor (DSP) technology was used to calculate in real time, the control law between the accelerometer signals and the inertial actuators. The data obtained from this experiment verified that as much as 20 dB of rejection could be realized by this type of system. A discussion is included of recent tests performed in which vibrations were actively controlled in three axes simultaneously. In the three degree-of-freedom (3 DOF) system, the air bearings were designed {{in such a way that}} the payload is free to rotate about the azimuth axis, as well as translate in the two horizontal directions. The actuator developed for the DAMPER project has applications beyond payload isolation, including structural damping and source vibration isolation. This report includes a brief discussion of these applications, as well as a commercialization plan for the actuator...|$|R

30|$|The total mileage of Chinese {{high-speed}} railway has exceeded 16, 000  km {{since the}} Beijing–Tianjin high-speed intercity railway line {{with an overall}} length of 120  km was put into operation in 2008. With the operation speed of high-speed trains arriving at 300 – 350  km/h, the operation safety of trains has become a main concern to the railway administrators and passengers. Rail corrugation and polygonalization of high-speed railway wheels are two emergent problems influencing the operation safety and comfort of trains in the Chinese high-speed railway industry. For instance, the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway line has an overall length of 1, 318  km, and was first put into operation in 2011. After 2 – 3  months’ operation, rail corrugation occurred in some track sections. Polygonalization of high-speed railway wheels was also found to be serious after the high-speed trains were used for 1 – 2  years. Rail corrugation and polygonalization of high-speed railway wheels can not only lead to a poor passenger ride comfort and a high environment noise level but also decrease the service life of some key parts such as wheelsets, <b>bearings,</b> and <b>rails.</b> Therefore, it is significant to study the rail corrugation and polygonalization of high-speed railway wheels in high-speed railway lines. This paper mainly concerns the problem of rail corrugation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{method was}} {{proposed}} {{for measuring the}} effective stress intensity factor ranges of Mode II fatigue crack growth by using the hysteresis loop for a specimen's surface strain. Many cases of rolling contact fatigue failure, {{such as those that}} occur in railway <b>rails,</b> <b>bearings</b> and gears are due to repeated high shear loads. In order to prevent such fatigue failures, the resistance of a material to repeated high shear loads must be determined. The fatigue crack growth characteristics are dependent on the Mode II stress intensity factor range. However, conventionally measured Mode II fatigue crack growth characteristics vary according to the measurement methods. Therefore, the authors improved the experimental measurement method proposed by Murakami, and proposed a way to measure the Mode II effective stress intensity factor range. Improvements to the jigs and specimen were made based on the ideal mechanical model of the experimental method. Furthermore, to measure the Mode II fatigue crack growth behavior, strain gauges were applied to the specimen and the hysteresis loop of the strain was measured with high accuracy by using a newly developed subtraction circuit...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{system for}} {{measuring}} the rail profiles of a long hydrostatic guideway is proposed and applied to a precision roll lathe. The rail profiles, consisting of rail form errors and a parallelism error, are measured with four capacitive probes placed on the two rail surfaces, and a laser interferometer with angular optics. The form error of each rail is measured using a mixed sequential two-probe method, while the parallelism error between the rails is measured with two opposing capacitive probes. To eliminate the necessity for additional guidance mechanisms, the probe table is guided by air <b>bearings</b> and the <b>rails</b> being measured. To verify the measurement results, two self-verification techniques are suggested and tested. Firstly, the linear motion errors of the probe table on the two rails are compared, yielding a difference of 0. 79 µm in 2 σ. Secondly, {{the sum of the}} rail form errors is compared with the slope-removed sum of the two capacitive probes used for the parallelism measurement, yielding a difference of 0. 81 µm in 2 σ.

In {{order to be able}} to better characterise wheel bearing wear development in rail vehicles, an investigation into the key rail vehicle dynamic scenarios and the subsequent variations in applied bearing loads within normal operation has been conducted. The work includes the development of a dynamic model that determines the variation in loading applied to a <b>rail</b> vehicle’s <b>bearings</b> during normal operation. This model is based on load changes that occur due to vehicle cornering, acceleration and braking. A geographic survey of Brisbane’s Ipswich to Roma St railway line has been conducted, and the velocity evolution of a passenger train navigating the line has been determined using a conservative “perfect-driver” model. A subsequent simulation of dynamic bearing load variations has been implemented, based on an IMU 160 passenger train unit traversing the given track section. It was found that the bearing load variation due to vehicle dynamics is significant along this section of track; it was found that the bearing load increased by as much as 19 %.

40|$|Artificial gravity {{provided}} by short radius centrifugation {{is considered a}} promising countermeasure to the deleterious physiological effects of microgravity during long-duration space flight. We investigated the feasibility of dual countermeasures to address space flight deconditioning of the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems, by combining centrifugation with lower-body exercise. The exercise device is a small stair-stepper with constant resistance {{provided by}} dampers beneath each foot, and is the first such device {{to be used in}} centrifuge studies. We modified the existing centrifuge to support the additional stresses due to exercise and added following structural elements: support struts on the rotation shaft, a redesigned footplate to which the exercise device was mounted, and horizontal support beams. We also added a sliding mattress with linear ball <b>bearings</b> on <b>rails,</b> so that the subject's body can move up and down while stepping. Design changes and exercise feasibility were validated by having subjects exercise during centrifugation at 23 rpm. We measured heart rate, blood pressure, forces on the feet, and knee deflection due to Coriolis accelerations, for up to four subjects. As expected, heart rate and blood pressure did increase normally with exercise on the centrifuge, relative to when not exercising. However, both heart rate and systolic blood pressure were higher for exercise on the non-spinning centrifuge than on the spinning centrifuge, attributable to the necessity of pulling against the stair-stepper's dampers in order to exercise while lying supine. Approximately half the subject's weight was exerted on the footplate when not exercising. (cont.) This was expected: since the subject's head was at zero radius and thus at 0 -g radially, the 100 % artificial gravity gradient along the body's longitudinal axis gave an average effective gravity of about 0. 5 g. More pressure (up to 80 % body weight) was exerted when the subject was stair-stepping. The measured lateral deflection of the knee during normal stair-stepping and knee bend exercises increased up to three inches compared to deflections in a non-rotating environment. This issue must be further addressed to determine if stair-stepping or knee bend exercises are to be used safely in artificial gravity. by Jessica Leigh Edmonds. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|In {{rolling contact}} fatigue, cracks grow by tensile (Mode I) or shear modes (Mode II and III) under the {{material}} surface {{due to the}} complicated tri-axial stress state. Flaking type failure, such as <b>bearings</b> and <b>rails,</b> is essentially due to the crack growth behaviour of these cracks. In order to evaluate the fatigue strength under rolling contact loading, {{it is important to}} understand the characteristics of such cracks under complicated stress state. The aim of this thesis was to study mixed mode behaviour of fatigue cracks, under cyclic shear stress and static compressive stress. Both experimental and numerical methods are applied. Experimental work consisted of the fatigue testing of bearing steel (SAE 52100) under compressive mean stress. The test results show that resistance to mode I crack propagation increases with increasing compressive mean stress. In addition, non-propagating cracks, which are hardly observed at stress ratio R of - 1 in high strength steel, were observed at R = - 5 and - 10. In the numerical investigations, stress intensity factor of complicated branch cracks in a plate (2 D) under combined cyclic shear stress and static compressive stress was determined by finite element method. This study reveal the interaction behavior between the mode I and II cracks. The experimental and simulation results showed that there is a competitive behaviour between the Mode I and Mode II crack growth. The role of the compressive mean stress is to suppress the Mode I crack propagation. The magnitude of the compressive mean stress required to suppress Mode I crack growth depends on the Mode II crack length and applied cyclic shear stress. It was also observed that mode I crack lengths, if long enough, may reduce the KII of the Mode II crack even by 63 %. The observation of non-propagating cracks for high compressive mean stress is one of novel finding of this study. However, the physical reason for this is not yet know. This is left future work. Furthermore, the numerical investigations can be extended to study more detail the influence of crack surface friction on crack growth mechanics...|$|R
40|$|Railways {{offer an}} {{efficient}} and economic transport mode {{in many parts}} of the developed countries including Australia, China and USA. Ballast layer is designed as a load <b>bearing</b> layer for <b>rail</b> tracks and to be free draining, but when the ballast voids are wholly or partially impeded due to the intrusion of fine particles, the ballast can be considered to be fouled. Fouling causes a reduction in the drainage capacity of ballast, thereby reducing the track resiliency and triggering high maintenance costs. Geosynthetics are commonly used in railway construction for reinforcement and stabilization purposes. When railway ballast becomes fouled the beneficial effect of the geosynthetics could decrease significantly. This paper presents a study of how the interface behavior of geosynthetics-ballast copes with fouling using discrete element modelling (DEM) of large-scale direct shear tests. A series of large-scale direct shear tests for coal fouled ballast were carried out in the laboratory and were then simulated in the DEM. Shear stress-strain and volumetric dilation responses obtained from the DEM simulations were in reasonable agreement with those measured experimentally. The contact force distributions of fresh and fouled ballast were captured and shown that the fouled ballast exhibited higher number of contact forces compared to the fresh ballast assembly. This is due to coal fines accumulated in voids among large particles then partially carry and transmit contact forces across the assembly. Strains developed horizontally across the geogrid were also analyzed in this study...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Rail {{transportation}} plays a {{major role}} in the transportation sector of South Africa and many other countries of the world. Trains are locomotives and carriages that travel on rail tracks. The trains steer with the wheel flange against the inside vertical face of the rail head or crown. This steering action produces wear due to the friction between the two steel surfaces moving relative to one another. It is observed that wear at curves is severe due to the high lateral forces of the wheel flange <b>bearing</b> against the <b>rail</b> crown, with very undesirable economic consequences. This study investigated steel rail material degradation at play between the sliding and the rubbing surfaces of the wheel flange on track by characterising some worn rail samples from Mayfair, Johannesburg, South Africa, rail line, with the aim to gain a better understanding of their wear mechanism. Chemical composition analysis of steel rail sample was conducted. Hardness and tensile behaviour of steel rail were measured and calculated, respectively. Microstructure features of the worn rail samples were also examined, using the stereoscope, microscope, and the Scanning Electron Microscope. Topography and roughness test analyses were also conducted. It was discovered that the examined worn out rail, which was originally produced from high carbon steel with pearlites and ferrites microstructure, undergoes a micro-structural evolution to form martensitic structure over the years of usage and exposure to environmental conditions mostly at the surface of the rail, which tends to become brittle. Some welded particles were also found to be interlocked in between the surfaces of the rail, causing gradual degradation and breakdown of the rail. These were caused by pressure shock and impact forces between the movement of the rail and the wheel flange. Hardness tests carried out on the top surfaces of 429, 432 and 591 VHN readings of steel rail compared to that of the sub inner part of 359, 352 and 338 VHN readings of steel track, found the top-surface to be harder. The surface worn-out particles were found to be oxidised. Topography tests were conducted to consider the roughness rate of steel rail track.

40|$|Problem Statement: Fatigue {{life testing}} of large tapered roller <b>bearing</b> {{components}} for <b>rail</b> applications is often very costly and time consuming. The {{purpose of this}} project is to assist Amsted Rail Company, Inc. develop a large railroad tapered roller bearing test rig that does not require scaled down prototypes bearings. As these are tapered rollers, loads can be applied from either the lateral or radial direction. L 10 bearing life test predictions for the test rig bearings should be carried out using the American Bearing Manufacturers Association standards. The test rig can be designed to test as many as 4 bearings at a time or as little as one bearing raceway (1 / 2 bearing) at a time. The overall goal of the project is to design a test rig that will provide accelerated life test results, create solid models of the test rig design for illustration purposes, and provide supporting design calculations. Rationale: With completion of this project it will allow Amstead Rail Company Inc. to test their bearing products in a quicker and more efficient manner. They {{will be able to}} obtain test data in a much quicker manner, drastically decreasing the amount of time needed to make manufacturing adjustments to current production. Secondly, it will allow Amstead Rail to excel in product development by enabling them to test prototype bearing at a never achieved pace. Approach: Our team has used the method of static analysis to solve for the loads corresponding to a <b>rail</b> car <b>bearing</b> under full and partial loads. We then designed a prototype test rig and that we saw as a best fit to our customers need. We then animated the product in 3 D using the Inventor CAD program and analyzed the rig/bearing in ANSYS computer software to ensure that it could provide/withstand the designed loads. Interim Results and Conclusions: As of 12 / 1 / 2014 our team has determined the static loads that may be seen in the rig and bearing during testing operation. We have factored in many engineering criteria and worked with our contact personnel at Amstead Rail to ensure that our prototype design will meet their desired needs. Currently, our team starting to move forward with the Inventor 3 D modeling and ANSYS load analysis of the test rig. Anticipated Results and Conclusions: The expected results of this design project are to provide a bearing test rig concept that has been proven through static analysis; with corresponding 3 D CAD drawings that will allow for a functioning prototype to be built along with a bill of materials needed to create the rig.

40|$|QR National’s {{experience}} of wheel wear {{in the operation}} of its central Queensland coal fleet has shown a high sensitivity to the proportion of the wagon fleet with high bogie rotational resistance. In periods where significant parts of the fleet exhibited high centre <b>bearing</b> rotational resistance <b>rail</b> lubrication conditions also were deteriorated and wheel life fleet wide was noticed to shorten. QR National believe that this increase in wheel rail wear was the result of reduce rail lubrication effectiveness caused by unfavorable contact mechanics at the gauge face of the rail. The Rail CRC Australia Bogie Rotation Friction Management project has conducted a case study of the QR National VSA wagon. The case study analysis shows wheel rail wear on the Goonyella system operations of VSA wagons are very sensitive to bogie rotation friction especially for the tightest curve (304 m) where wheelsets 1, 2 and 3 all flange. The wheel rail contact mechanics are dependant on the bogie rotation friction specifically the angle of attack generated on axle 1 and 2 increases due to bogie rotation friction. The flange contact forces and resulting contact stresses change only slightly with increases of bogie rotation friction, under 10 %. The significant change in the gauge face contact mechanics is the creepage angle. The creepage angle on the gauge face of the 304 m curve changes from 47 to 65 degrees to the rail axis for axle 1 and 18 to 57 degrees on axle 2. With this change in the flange contact creepage angle lubricant is increasingly swept off the rail gauge face increasing the friction coefficients for following wheelsets. Previous studies on bogie rotation friction has shown that wear losses from high bogie rotation forces are due to warp of the bogie. Bogie warp occurs in the track transition in order to rotate the bogie however in constant curving {{there is no need to}} retain the warped bogie shape and transition design can be used to relieve bogie warp 1. An alternative curve transition design is suggested for the 304 m curve. This alternative design termed a “curvature overrun transition”, has small section of tighter curve radius in the transition section whilst the curve body is a slightly larger radius giving a minimal change to the curve alignment. The curvature over run design gives significant improvements to the angle of attack and contact mechanics in the curve body. However wheel wear savings only occur for vehicles having high bogie rotation friction and rail wear rates are effectively higher due to higher peak rail wear...|$|R
40|$|Moving heavy parts at {{high speeds}} with precise {{positioning}} is a production goal of many companies. Several researchers dealt with this challenge and proposed different studies. Achieving this task requires a system which is powerful enough to accelerate or deccelerate the heavy load quickly. Also, it requires high accuracy control tools. These tools should have fast response and good stability under changeable working conditions. In this work a servovalve-controlled-hydraulic motor driven positioning system is modeled and its sensitivity to different operation conditions changes was studied. ^ The positioning system consisted of a square <b>rail</b> <b>bearing</b> linear table (Parker 41803 ST) with an accuracy of 0. 001 inches and maximum travel span of 36. 5 inches. The power screw was driven by a high speed hydraulic motor (Parker M 4 - 015) which provided the system with up to 6 inches per second linear speed for the 36. 5 inch span. The motor speed was controlled by a BD 15 Parker servovalve. The position of the moving table is monitored using an absolute encoder to feedback position information to the control system. A LASER distance sensor (LDS 80 / 10 of Dynavision) was used to detect the workpiece with a +/− 0. 001 inches accuracy. The analog output of this sensor was fed into the control system to correct the table position until it reached the desired operating point. The EASY 5 was used to build a dynamic model of the system. The hydraulic system was modeled and simulated using EASY 5 which had predefined hydraulic components models {{in addition to the}} ability of defining new ones. EASY 5 model made it possible to study the dynamic behavior of the system under varied conditions of the entrained air, servovalve frequency, motor displacement, conductor length, motor leakage, mass and temperature changes. ^ A servovalve-controlled hydraulic motor-driven positioning system was built and a dynamic model of the system was built using EASY 5. ^ Eigenvalues sensitivity analysis showed that fluid line between the hydraulic motor and the servovalve is the most influential factor on system stability. ^ As a matter of total time to reach the final point, performance was at: (1) 0. 2 % entrained air compared with 0. 5 % and 1 %. (2) Servovalve frequency, time delay for 1 Hz was increased to 1. 38 sec. compared with 1. 28 sec. for 50 Hz. (3) Using 0. 1 in 3 displacement motor reduced total time although it increased time delay compared with the 0. 15 in 3 and 0. 3 in 3 displacement motors. (4) Shorter conductor reduced the total time compared with the longer lines. Also, increasing tubing length increased the pressure in motor outlet port. (5) Increasing motor leakage increased the total time to reach the final point. (6) Increasing the working mass with about 65 % increased total time with about 30 %. (7) In EASY 5 model, replacing PID controller with PI increased settling time more than 50 %. (8) Adding Smith predictor to the PID reduced settling time with about 11 %. (9) When it was added to the PI controller, settling time was reduced by about 18 %. ...|$|R
