5|$|The red wattlebird is hard {{to confuse}} with any other species, though in poor {{visibility}} might <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> the spiny-cheeked honeyeater, or little or western wattlebirds.|$|E
5|$|Children {{may have}} {{behaviors}} that are easily mistaken for epileptic seizures but are not. These include breath-holding spells, bed wetting, night terrors, tics and shudder attacks. Gastroesophageal reflux may cause arching of the back and twisting of the {{head to the side}} in infants, which may <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> tonic-clonic seizures.|$|E
5|$|Guepinia helvelloides has {{a rather}} unusual appearance, {{and is not}} likely to <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> other fungi. However, the red {{chanterelle}} species Cantharellus cinnabarinus is superficially similar; unlike G.helvelloides, however, it does not have a rubbery and gelatinous texture, and its undersurface is wrinkled, not smooth.|$|E
50|$|After {{the attacks}} of September 11, 2001, Sikhs in the West have <b>been</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> Muslims and {{subjected}} to hate crimes. Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh living in Mesa, Arizona, {{was shot to death}} on September 16, 2001 when he <b>was</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> a Muslim.|$|R

5|$|Mycena nargan {{has a very}} {{distinct}} appearance, and {{is unlikely}} to <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> other Mycenas. However, one noted unintentional misidentification occurred when the M.nargan on the cover photograph of Bruce A. Fuhrer's 2005 book A Field Guide to Australian Fungi was labelled as Mycena nivalis, a species with a white cap.|$|E
5|$|S.occidentalis {{may also}} <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> Microstoma floccosum, which {{occurs in the}} same habitat. M.floccosum, however, has taller cups and is covered with stiff white hairs. Another cup-fungus, Scutellinia scutellata, is {{disc-shaped}} without a stem, and is fringed with black hairs around its rim.|$|E
5|$|The related black-headed sugar ant (Camponotus nigriceps) has {{a similar}} {{appearance}} and may <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> a banded sugar ant. Black-headed sugar ants are lighter in colour than banded sugar ants and the orange-brown band is absent from their gaster.|$|E
50|$|During a European train journey, a nobleman's butler Josef (Paul Lukas) <b>is</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> his {{employer}} Prince Alfred von Rommer (Nils Asther) by a beautiful woman, Marie (Elissa Landi), {{and he does}} nothing to disillusion her. In due course, the Prince himself arrives and <b>is</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> his servant.|$|R

50|$|Several of his roles have <b>been</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> Kirk Thornton.|$|R
5|$|A {{particular}} viewpoint {{is called}} a naya or a partial viewpoint. According to Vijay Jain, Nayavada does not deny the attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; but qualifies them to be from a particular perspective. A naya reveals {{only a part of}} the totality, and should not <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> the whole. A synthesis of different viewpoints is said to be achieved by the doctrine of conditional predications (syādvāda).|$|E
5|$|California condors {{have the}} largest {{wingspan}} of any North American bird. They are surpassed in both body length and weight only by the trumpeter swan and the introduced mute swan. The American white pelican and whooping crane also have longer bodies than the condor. Condors are so large that they can <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> a small, distant airplane, which possibly occurs more often than they are mistaken for other species of bird.|$|E
5|$|Immature American {{white and}} scarlet ibises are very {{difficult}} to tell apart, although scarlet ibises tend to have darker legs and bare skin around the face. An immature American white ibis could <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> an immature glossy ibis, but the latter is wholly dark brown and lacks the white belly and rump. The adult is distinguishable from the wood stork, which is much larger and its wings have more black on them.|$|E
25|$|That {{the way to}} Heaven <b>is</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> {{the most}} melancholy walk.|$|R

5|$|News of Stillman's defeat, the Indian Creek massacre, {{and other}} smaller attacks {{triggered}} panic among the white population. Many settlers fled to Chicago, then a small town, which became overcrowded with hungry refugees. Many Potawatomis also fled towards Chicago, {{not wanting to}} {{get caught in the}} conflict nor <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> hostiles. Throughout the region, settlers hurriedly organized militia units and built small forts.|$|E
5|$|Novices may mistake {{juvenile}} death caps for edible puffballs or mature specimens {{for other}} edible Amanita species, such as A.lanei, so some authorities recommend avoiding the collecting of Amanita species {{for the table}} altogether. The white form of A.phalloides may <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> edible species of Agaricus, especially the young fruitbodies whose unexpanded caps conceal the telltale white gills; all mature species of Agaricus have dark-colored gills.|$|E
5|$|Other {{members of}} the genus Pholiota may <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> Pholiota flammans, {{especially}} Pholiota squarrosa which commonly forms large tufts {{at the base of}} deciduous as well as coniferous trees. P.squarrosa tends to be a less intense yellow color than P.flammans. P.adiposa is also similar, but prefers to grow on dead hardwoods; unlike P.flammans, it has gelatinous scales on the stem as well as the cap.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{detritus}} worms <b>are</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> Planarians {{or other}} types of worms.|$|R

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by David S. Cohen, Dan Greaney and Steve Tompkins, with Ken Keeler {{coming up with the}} story and the general idea of {{intentionally}} bad writing. It was directed by Neil Affleck, and Tim Conway, Gailard Sartain and Phil Hartman guest-starred. The producers were initially uneasy about the episode, as they feared that the purposely bad writing would <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> actual bad writing. The episode, however, now appears on several lists of the most popular Simpsons episodes.|$|E
5|$|The later evolved commelinids have {{various kinds}} of flower, few of which are 'lily-like'. In the order Poales, {{comprising}} grasses, rushes and sedges, flowers are either petal-less or have small, unshowy petals. Many Zingiberales species have brightly coloured and showy flowers. However, their apparent structure is misleading. For example, the six tepals of cannas are small and hidden under expanded and brightly coloured stamens or staminodes which resemble petals and may <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> them.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} differential diagnosis in gout is septic arthritis. This {{should be considered}} in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment. To help with diagnosis, a synovial fluid Gram stain and culture may be performed. Other conditions that can look similar include pseudogout, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and reactive arthritis. Gouty tophi, in particular when not located in a joint, can <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> basal cell carcinoma or other neoplasms.|$|E

5|$|United Nations Security {{officers}} are generally responsible for security within the UN Headquarters. They {{are equipped with}} weapons and handcuffs and may <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> NYPD officers, due to similarity in uniforms. The NYPD's 17th Precinct patrols the area around and near the complex, but does not have jurisdiction inside the UN headquarters themselves since the headquarters are considered international property.|$|E
5|$|When young, it may <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> the edible St George's {{mushroom}} (Calocybe gambosa) or {{the miller}} (Clitopilus prunulus). It {{has been responsible}} for many cases of mushroom poisoning in Europe. E.sinuatum causes primarily gastrointestinal problems that, though not generally life-threatening, have been described as highly unpleasant. Delirium and depression are uncommon sequelae. It is generally not considered to be lethal, although one source has reported deaths from the consumption of this mushroom.|$|E
5|$|After the Republic was proclaimed, the {{national}} flag was provisionally adopted as distinguishing {{flag of the}} head of state in place of the royal standard. On the initiative of the Ministry of Defence, a project was prepared in 1965 to adopt a distinct flag. Opportunity suggested the most natural solution was the Italian tricolour defaced with the coat of arms; however, under conditions of poor visibility, this could easily <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> the standard of the President of the United States of Mexico, which is also that country's national flag. The standard is kept in the custody of the Commander of the Reggimento Corazzieri of the Arma dei Carabinieri, along with the war flag (assigned to Regiment in 1878).|$|E
