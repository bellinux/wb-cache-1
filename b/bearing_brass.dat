25|$|A {{memorial}} {{to the victims of}} the attack was dedicated at Norfolk Naval Station in Virginia on 12 October 2001. It was erected along the shore of Willoughby Bay, and overlooks the channel used by Navy ships transiting to sea. Seventeen low-level markers stand for the youthfulness of the sailors, whose lives were cut short. Three tall granite monoliths, each <b>bearing</b> <b>brass</b> plaques, stand for the three colors of the American flag. A set of brown markers encircling the memorial symbolize the darkness and despair that overcame the ship. In addition, 28 black pine trees were planted to represent the 17 sailors and the 11 children they left behind.|$|E

These ILs (Ionic Liquids) were employed as leaching agents {{in the treatment of}} industrial copper and zinc bearing slag for the recovery of metals. Results showed that synthesized all novel ionic liquids meet the standard specifications of an ionic liquid. Metal recovery rates decrease with time except for zinc dissolution in 1, 3 -dibenzylimidazolium trifluoroacetate. 1, 3 -dibenzylimidazolium trifluoroacetate, when compared with others, is a more effective leaching agent for the treatment of copper and zinc <b>bearing</b> <b>brass</b> slag. Metal recovery rates achieved with this IL are 62. 58 % for zinc and 24. 95 % for copper...|$|E

However, on the Sunday before the disaster pumping was stopped and the beam raised off its bearing to enable new <b>bearing</b> <b>brasses</b> to be put in. This was a common procedure for engines of this class, after four years of work the originals had worn. As the beam was being replaced it fell from its supporting jacks and [...] "fell with great force into its bearings".|$|R

Its deep throbbing roar warned him what they might expect when they reached open water, but he went down the steps and helped Dick to tighten some <b>bearing</b> <b>brasses,</b> after which a peon threw down their ropes and the screw began to rattle. With a few puffs of steam from her funnel the launch moved away and presently met the broken swell at the harbor mouth. Then her easy motion changed to a drunken lurch and Jake gazed with misgivings at the white-topped seas ahead.|$|R

50|$|The Willans {{engine was}} single-acting; steam {{pressure}} was only {{applied to the}} upper surface of the pistons. This was a common feature of high-speed engines at this time, in a measure to reduce knocking and increased wear, thus permitting higher operating speeds. The principle was that in a single-acting engine the forces on the connecting rod and its bearings always act to compress the rod, rather than reversing direction twice in every revolution, as for the double-acting engine. The lower <b>bearing</b> <b>brasses,</b> which carried a load only during starting, were smaller than the crankpin and the main working brasses above. Although single-acting engines produce only half the power of an equivalent double-acting engine, or else must run at twice their speed, this reduced knocking could allow them to run {{more than twice as}} fast.|$|R

50|$|Alloying a metal {{is done by}} {{combining}} it {{with one or more}} other elements that often enhance its properties. For example, the combination of carbon with iron produces steel, which is stronger than iron, its primary element. The electrical and thermal conductivity of alloys is usually lower than that of the pure metals. The physical properties, such as density, reactivity, Young's modulus of an alloy may not differ greatly from those of its base element, but engineering properties such as tensile strength, ductility, and shear strength may be substantially {{different from those of the}} constituent materials. This is sometimes a result of the sizes of the atoms in the alloy, because larger atoms exert a compressive force on neighboring atoms, and smaller atoms exert a tensile force on their neighbors, helping the alloy resist deformation. Sometimes alloys may exhibit marked differences in behavior even when small amounts of one element are present. For example, impurities in semiconducting ferromagnetic alloys lead to different properties, as first predicted by White, Hogan, Suhl, Tian Abrie and Nakamura.Some alloys are made by melting and mixing two or more metals. Bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, was the first alloy discovered, during the prehistoric period now known as the bronze age. It was harder than pure copper and originally used to make tools and weapons, but was later superseded by metals and alloys with better properties. In later times bronze has been used for ornaments, bells, statues, and <b>bearings.</b> <b>Brass</b> is an alloy made from copper and zinc.|$|R

At the time, they were [...] "the most complete and powerful which had been produced by the Soho Manufactory". [...] The mill's wheels and shafts were made of iron. An exception to this {{were some of the}} cogs, which were of hard wood, though others were of cast iron, as were the pinions. The teeth, some of wood and others of iron, were manufactured by chipping and filing into epicycloidal shapes. The shafts and axles were made of iron and the <b>bearings</b> of <b>brass.</b> The mill's double engine, producing , drove 20 pairs of millstones, each grinding some nine bushels of corn an hour. It also provided power for raising corn, fanning it to free it of impurities, sifting it, dressing the meal and lowering it into the barges, which made the process more efficient.|$|R

40|$|The German {{people today}} have embraced {{their sense of}} {{collective}} responsibility. They have accepted the seamless case of genocide and its implications {{are part of the}} national soul. They have come to full reckoning, determined to remember a difficult past and not repeat it. The Austrians, the Dutch, and the Poles have yet to reach the point of confession or even an awareness of responsibility. Perhaps the most remarkable symbol of national responsibility is the grassroots Stolperstein or Stumble Stone project, which began in Germany in 1992 with the goal to remember the victims of the Holocaust individually. Cobblestone-size concrete squares <b>bearing</b> a <b>brass</b> plate inscribed with the names and birth and death dates of victims are set in the sidewalk at the victim’s last place of chosen residence prior to deportation. To date, more than 50, 000 markers have been laid in eighteen European countries. This is an intimate reminder of the Holocaust. It recalls the taking of neighbors from their homes and their unjust deaths. It rebuilds the fabric of community. Explicit in this is the message that there are no innocent bystanders...|$|R

For many years this was the only remaining brass in the church, but it too has now gone. All there is today is a rubbing. The chancel was dominated by heavy Victorian choirstalls, which were removed in 2000 to create a more open and flexible space. On the window ledge on the north side is a statue brought back from the shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham in Norfolk. Hanging above the chancel space is a wrought iron Corona (crown) installed in 2000 and symbolising the kingship of Christ. It is made up of three separate crowns intertwined: the crown of thorns, the crown of life (symbolised by the vine) and the golden crown of victory.|$|R
6000|$|Almayer called aloud for {{his wife}} and daughter, but {{receiving}} no response, stood listening intently. The murmur of the crowd reached him faintly, bringing with it the assurance of some unusual event. He glanced at the river just as he was going to leave the verandah and checked himself {{at the sight of a}} small canoe crossing over from the Rajah's landing-place. The solitary occupant (in whom Almayer soon recognised Babalatchi) effected the crossing a little below the house and paddled up to the Lingard jetty in the dead water under the bank. Babalatchi clambered out slowly and went on fastening his canoe with fastidious care, as if not in a hurry to meet Almayer, whom he saw looking at him from the verandah. This delay gave Almayer time to notice and greatly wonder at Babalatchi's official get-up. The statesman of Sambir was clad in a costume befitting his high rank. A loudly checkered sarong encircled his waist, and from its many folds peeped out the silver hilt of the kriss that saw the light only on great festivals or during official receptions. Over the left shoulder and across the otherwise unclad breast of the aged diplomatist glistened a patent leather belt <b>bearing</b> a <b>brass</b> plate with the arms of Netherlands under the inscription, [...] "Sultan of Sambir." [...] Babalatchi's head was covered by a red turban, whose fringed ends falling over the left cheek and shoulder gave to his aged face a ludicrous expression of joyous recklessness. When the canoe was at last fastened to his satisfaction he straightened himself up, shaking down the folds of his sarong, and moved with long strides towards Almayer's house, swinging regularly his long ebony staff, whose gold head ornamented with precious stones flashed in the morning sun. Almayer waved his hand to the right towards the point of land, to him invisible, but in full view from the jetty.|$|R

I don't credit absolutely that story Captain Robinson tells of Schultz conspiring in Chantabun with some ruffians in a Chinese junk to steal the anchor off the starboard bow of the Bohemian Girl schooner. Robinson's story is too ingenious altogether. That other tale of the engineers of the Nan-Shan finding Schultz at midnight in the engine-room busy hammering at the <b>brass</b> <b>bearings</b> to carry them off for sale on shore seems to me more authentic. Apart from this little weakness, {{let me tell you}} that Schultz is a smarter sailor than many who never took a drop of drink in their lives, and perhaps no worse morally than some men you and I know who have never stolen the value of a penny. He may not be a desirable person to have on board one's ship, but since you have no choice he may be made to do, I believe. The important thing is to understand his psychology. Don't give him any money till you have done with him. Not a cent, if he begs ever so. For as sure as Fate the moment you give him any money he will begin to steal. Just remember that." ...|$|R

Introduction: 2 HP Three Phase Induction Motor, No. 83362, Type 1, Form K. 1800 R. P. M., 110 Volts, 60 Cycles, 12 amperes. The primary or rotor {{of the motor}} is mounted in a hollow {{cylindrical}} frame of cast iron. This frame also forms {{the base of the}} machine and supports two end plates which contain the rotor bearings. The <b>bearings</b> consist of <b>brass</b> boxes arranged to be lubricated by two rings in each bearing. These rings revolve as the shaft turns carrying the oil from a chamber below the bearings. The primary consists of an iron core which is built up of sheet steel stampings. The core is firmly bolted to the frame. The conductors, which are copper wires or bars, depending upon the size of the machine, are placed in grooves in the core. These coils are insulated from the core and from each other where more than one conductor is placed in a slot. The windings, which are (y) connected, are held in the slots by thin wedges of tough wood, to protect the winding from mechanical injury, and also from the mechanical pull due to the reaction of the flux in the rotor. The secondary member or rotor is built up of laminated sheet steel. The laminae are insulated from each other by sheets of tissue paper or by a coating of japan, {{in order to reduce the}} loss by eddy currents which are induced by the flux. The conductors in this member are heavy copper bars which are short circuited at the ends of the rotor by heavy copper plates...|$|R
5000|$|His splendid and {{originally}} richly enamelled monumental brass survives in {{the parish}} church of St Columb Major. It is in a fairly complete state, and shows Sir John bare-headed but otherwise in full armour, between his two wives dressed in gowns, mantles, and pedimental head-dresses. Below them are two smaller male figures, one partly perfect in armour, and underneath again, six female children, of whom two remain. The brasses are firmly fixed to the original slab of grey marble by apparently the original fastenings. They were originally in the Arundell chapel (a chantry built by the Arundells {{on the south side}} of the chancel of the parish church), and were early in the 19th century covered with some pews which were then placed in the chapel. On the restoration of the church later that century, the chapel being re-pewed, they were removed to their present position, which is an unfortunate selection, as it subjects them to a large amount of wear from the feet of persons passing over them, they being on the floor of the nave immediately below the chancel steps.
