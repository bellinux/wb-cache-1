40|$|Abstract. Evidence from {{an array}} of dryland systems {{suggests}} that chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) grain yield could be improved through better phenological adaptation. However, information {{on the relationship between}} phenology and Ascochyta response genes, and their possible interaction with <b>biomass</b> <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> <b>yield,</b> is missing. Accordingly, the aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the associations between the above factors and <b>biomass</b> <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> in chickpea. To that end, standard Israeli cultivars and advanced generation bulked progeny from the cv. Hadas × ICC 5810 cross were used. Hadas is a late-flowering, high-yielding Israeli kabuli (0. 45 g/seed) cultivar with moderate field resistance to Ascochyta blight, whereas ICC 5810 is a day-neutral desi (0. 15 g/seed) genotype with a strong temperature response, from India. Higher yields were observed among the late-flowering bulks of the Hadas × ICC 5810 progeny. No relationship between the Ascochyta response and <b>biomass</b> <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> was observed.

40|$|The {{yield of}} spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), {{one of the}} major crops planted in the Loess Plateau, China, is mainly {{affected}} by available water. Straw mulch and irrigation are efficient ways of influencing wheat yield and water-use efficiency. To develop better semiarid crop and water management practices, a 13 -year experiment in spring wheat monoculture was conducted at the Dingxi Soil and Water Conservation Institute of the Loess Plateau. The influence of rainfall during the growing season (March-July) on yields of rain-fed wheat was studied for 13 years (1982 - 1992 and 1997 - 1998). The influence of straw mulch and irrigation on wheat yield, and water-use efficiency, was studied for 2 years (1997 - 1998). We found that growing season rainfall had a significant (P < 0. 05) influence on <b>biomass</b> <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> of spring wheat in rain-fed conditions during the 13 years. Both <b>biomass</b> <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> were very low and varied significantly due to the low and significant variability of growing season rainfall. Straw mulch increased wheat yields significantly during both dry (1997) and wet (1998) years. It increased <b>biomass</b> <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> by 37 and 52 %, respectively, in 1997, and by 20 and 26 %, respectively, in 1998. Straw mulch also significantly decreased evapotranspiration (P < 0. 05), soil water depletion (P < 0. 01), and increased water-use efficiency (P < 0. 001). <b>Biomass</b> <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> both increased (P < 0. 01 or P < 0. 001) with increasing irrigation in 1997 and 1998. The three irrigation levels increased the biomass yield from 34 to 66 % in 1997, and from 34 to 77 % in 1998. The irrigation levels also increased grain yield from 53 to 102 % in 1997, and from 22 to 57 % in 1998. Water-use efficiency for <b>biomass</b> <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> also increased with increasing irrigation. On the other hand, irrigation water-use efficiency for <b>biomass</b> <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> decreased with increasing irrigation. The results suggest that higher crop yields in the semiarid Loess Plateau may be achieved by using irrigation, or a proper combination of straw mulch and irrigation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine whether tillage and residue practices have a significant effect on the yield and N content of corn (Zea mays L.) under nonlimiting soil N conditions. Nitrate leaching has been identified as a source of non-point-source pollution. By identifying tillage practices which maximize corn N uptake, recommendations can be based on how to minimize N loss. A 2 -year field study was conducted in southwestern Quebec on a 2. 4 -ha site of a Typic Endoaquent (Humic Gleysol) cropped to corn. Three types of tillage practice (conventional tillage, reduced tillage, and no-till) were combined with two residue levels (with and without) in a randomized complete block design. The effect of these practices on corn yield and corn N were studied. Seedling emergence rates in spring, and corn moisture content at harvest, were also monitored. Residues hindered initial plant emergence in the no-till plots. Corn N and moisture contents in 1996 and 1997 indicated that no-till with residue had a delayed maturity relative to the other treatments.

In this study we sought to identify QTLs in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) consistent across experiments conducted in Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Senegal, and the United States of America under limited water conditions. A panel of 383 diverse cowpea accessions and a recombinant inbred line population (RIL) were SNP genotyped using an Illumina 1536 GoldenGate assay. Phenotypic data from thirteen experiments conducted across the four countries were used to identify SNP-trait associations based on linkage disequilibrium association mapping, with bi-parental QTL mapping as a complementary strategy. We identified seven loci, five of which exhibited evidence suggesting pleiotropic effects (stay-green) between delayed senescence, <b>biomass,</b> <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> <b>yield.</b> Further, we provide evidence suggesting the existence of positive pleiotropy in cowpea based on positively correlated mean phenotypic values (0. 34, r, 0. 87) and allele effects (0. 07, r, 0. 86) for delayed senescence and grain yield across three African environments. Three of the five putative stay-green QTLs, Dro- 1, 3, and 7 were identified in both RILs and diverse germplasm with resolutions of 3. 2 cM or less {{for each of the}} three loci, suggesting that these may be valuable targets for marker-assisted breeding in cowpea.

Over 150 doubled-haploid lines in each of three unrelated wheat populations varying for embryo size and early vigour were phenotyped across multiple controlled environments. The Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping was then undertaken to understand genetic control and chromosomal location of these characteristics. Genotypic variance was large and repeatable for embryo and leaf size (width and length) but not specific leaf area or coleoptile tiller size. Genetic correlations for embryo size with leaf width and area were moderate to strong in size while repeatabilities for embryo size and early vigour were high on a line-mean basis. Multiple genomic regions were identified of commonly small genetic effect for each trait with many of these regions being common across populations. Further, collocation of regions for many traits inferred a common genetic basis {{for many of these}} traits. Chromosomes 1 B, 5 B, 7 A and 7 D, and the Rht-B 1 b and Rht-D 1 b-containing chromosomes 4 B and 4 D contained QTL for embryo size and leaf width. These studies indicate that while early vigour is a genetically complex trait, the selection of larger embryo progeny can be readily achieved in a wheat breeding program targeting development of high vigour lines...|$|R

Under this condition nutrient uptakes, <b>biomass</b> production <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> <b>yields</b> did vary between Otira, Orthega, Landora, Brazil, Svani, NK 96 - 300, Mixture 1 (Otira, Orthega, Landora) and Mixture 2 (Brazil, Svani and NK 96 - 300). Interaction between variety and soil fertility treatments were also significant. These findings open new possibilities for selection or plant breeding for genotypes with improved capability of nutrient acquisition from soils at different soil fertility levels e. g. in organic farming. Cropping of barley varieties in mixtures seems to increase (stimulate) nutrient uptakes (N, P, S, K, Mg, Ca, Mn, Zn, Cu <b>and</b> Mo) <b>and</b> <b>biomass</b> production. ...|$|R
40|$|Twenty rice landraces {{collected}} from different ecological regions of Bangladesh were studied {{to assess the}} nature and magnitude of genetic divergence among them. Based on twelve characters, the genotypes were grouped into five clusters. No parallel relationship between genetic and geographical divergence was observed. Inter-cluster distances were higher than the intra-cluster distances reflecting wider genetic diversity among the genotypes of different groups. The genotypes under cluster IV showed highest divergence among them as it exhibited highest intra-cluster distance. High level of inter-cluster distance was found between cluster II and V and between cluster I and III. Number of filled grains number /panicle, number of panicles/plant, <b>biomass</b> index <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> contributed considerably towards total divergence. Germplasm having these characters in the genetically distant cluster could, therefore, offer a significant scope {{for the development of}} high yielder through judicious selection...|$|R
40|$|Given {{the current}} water {{shortage}} in North Africa, improving water management {{to produce more}} crop per drop is vital. In addition, the introduction of drought-tolerant, less water-consuming crops such as quinoa is of great interest. To understand the response of quinoa to water stress in terms of <b>biomass</b> <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> under various irrigation management strategies, the SALTMED model was employed using field measurements during the cropping seasons of 2011 and 2012 at a site in the Marrakech region, south Morocco. Quinoa showed its ability {{to grow in the}} south of Morocco and give a good yield under full irrigation. However, the experimental and modelling results showed that under rainfed and deficit irrigation, the grain yield was lower than under the full irrigation treatment and was dependent on water deficit level. The study revealed that a reasonable grain yield of quinoa can only be obtained if it was subjected to moderate water stress conditions. The results indicated that the SALTMED model is able to simulate the quinoa <b>biomass</b> <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> under various water deficit levels and that the model can be used in the evaluation of different irrigation strategies...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{artificial}} neural network (ANN) models were designed to predict the <b>biomass</b> <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> of barley from soil properties; {{and the performance of}} ANN models was compared with earlier tested statistical models based on multivariate regression. Barley yield data and surface soil samples (0 – 30 cm depth) were collected from 1 m 2 plots at 112 selected points in the arid region of northern Iran. ANN yield models gave higher coefficient of determination and lower root mean square error compared to the multivariate regression, indicating that ANN is a more powerful tool than multivariate regression. Sensitivity analysis showed that soil electrical conductivity, sodium absorption ratio, pH, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and organic matter consistently influenced barley <b>biomass</b> <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> <b>yield.</b> A comparison of the two methods to identify the most important factors indicated that while in the ANN analysis, soil organic matter (SOM) was included among the most important factors; SOM was excluded from the most important factors in the multivariate analysis. This significant discrepancy between the two methods was apparently a consequence of the non-linear relationships of SOM with other soil properties. Overall, our results indicated that the ANN models could explain 93 and 89...|$|E
40|$|The {{interactive}} effects of elevated CO 2 concentration (EC; 700 μmol mol– 1), drought stress, UV exclusion, and nitrogen nutrition were studied in open-top chambers {{located in the}} Bohemian–Moravian highlands (24 in total). Above-ground biomass {{at the time of}} harvest, grain yield, and grain quality parameters were studied in winter wheat (variety Bohemia) and spring barley (variety Bojos). The results showed that elevation of CO 2 concentrations increased above-ground <b>biomass</b> <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> <b>yield.</b> Higher levels of nitrogen increased the stimulatory effect of EC on above-ground <b>biomass</b> <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> <b>yield.</b> In addition, UV exclusion stimulated the effect of EC. EC generally led to increased rates of photosynthesis and assimilate formation. Increased storage of starch in the grain led to an unbalanced proportion of proteins and a decrease in their relative content in grain. Similarly to grain yield and above-ground biomass, the decrease in protein content under EC was also more pronounced under UV exclusion. EC led also to reduction of other quality parameters, such as the Zeleny sedimentation test. This effect is more pronounced when nitrogen is not a limiting factor as well as under the effect of drought. The stronger effect under drought stress is probably due to increased water use efficiency...|$|E
40|$|To {{meet the}} rapid growth of the global {{population}} and the expected demand for food, significant enhancements in yields are needed, together with optimised N fertilisation and environmental issues, particularly in the production of major grain crops, such as wheat and rice. Improving photosynthesis, together with NUE, has been considered an unexploited opportunity in the research on improving crop yields. Therefore, transgenic wheat plants with increased SBPase activity showed an improved photosynthetic leaf rate <b>and</b> total <b>biomass</b> production. The Rubisco protein is a major N investment in crops, but it has also been exhibited that under some environmental conditions, there may be an excess of Rubisco greater than that needed to maintain photosynthesis. This {{raises the question of whether}} a small reduction in the amount of the Rubisco enzyme can be used to improve NUE without any negative effects on plant yield. To address the question, wheat plants with decreased Rubisco were produced. Physiological studies were performed on five independent transgenic lines with different levels of Rubisco, and the photosynthetic rates, <b>biomass</b> <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> <b>yields</b> were determined. Rubisco RNAi lines with reductions in the Rubisco protein of more than 40 % showed a significant decrease in photosynthesis, growth <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> <b>yield.</b> Interestingly, the plants with the lowest level of Rubisco activity had significantly higher levels of leaf and seed N when compared to WT plants. In contrast, small reductions in the Rubisco protein of between about 10 % and 25 % did not have an adverse effect on photosynthesis, growth or <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> in two independent transgenic wheat lines. Furthermore, to search for new promoters to drive good transgene expressions specialised to wheat leaves, two Brachypodium promoters, SBPase and FBPA, were cloned upstream of the GUS fusion gene and transformed into wheat leaves. Consequently, both promoters resulted in detectable GUS expression in wheat leaves at different growth stages and did not show expressions in the roots...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{models of}} crop growth are {{important}} for evaluating the effects of water deficits on crop yield or productivity. AquaCrop {{was developed by the}} FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization) of the United Nations to simulate yield responses to changes in the supply of water. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the model's ability to simulate winter wheat performance under full and deficit water conditions on China's Loess Plateau and to study the effect of different irrigation scenarios on wheat yield. The model's output was compared to experimental data collected between 2006 and 2011 at the Changwu Agri-ecological Station on the Loess Plateau. The model accurately estimated the soil water content of the root zone as well as the <b>biomass</b> <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> <b>yields</b> of winter wheat. When simulating the soil water during the 2008 - 2009 growing season, the calculated values of r(2), RMSE, ME, and the d-index were 0. 98, 8. 4 mm, 0. 98, and 0. 99 for no irrigation; 0. 95, 14. 4 mm, 0. 93, and 0. 98 for double irrigation; 0. 88, 22. 9 mm, 0. 68, and 0. 90 for triple irrigation; and 0. 93, 17. 5 mm, 0. 75, and 0. 9 for quadruple irrigation, respectively. For the <b>grain</b> <b>yield,</b> the r 2 values for the model's outputs under the single irrigation, double irrigation, triple irrigation, and quadruple irrigation treatments were 0. 80, 0. 98, 0. 99, and 0. 77, respectively. Comparing to no irrigation the highest increases in <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> were observed for scenarios in which irrigation was applied during the over-wintering and turning green stages. Moreover, the simulations indicated that under double irrigation regimes, water can be withheld during over-wintering and either turning green or stem elongation without greatly reducing yields. The minimum amounts of irrigation water required to achieve high WUE in wet, normal and dry years were 225, 150 and 150 mm, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Field pea (Pisum sativum L.) is {{frequently}} grown as a rotation crop with cereals in Australia. Modelling capacity to simulate field pea growth and production {{would be a}} useful tool for assessing crop management options in response to the fungal disease, blackspot. Field studies in South Australia (SA), Western Australia (WA) and Gansu, China were used to develop and test a field pea module for inclusion in APSIM. A new crop species was created using the “legume” template. Data on phenology, leaf area, <b>biomass</b> <b>and</b> components <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> were collected in field experiments in 2002 and 2003 in SA, and used to derive phenology parameters to test the model for <b>biomass</b> accumulation <b>and</b> yield. Data from WA and a wheat-field pea rotation experiment in Gansu, China were used to independently test the APSIM field pea module performance. Flowering dates, ranging from 80 to 105 days after sowing, were accurately predicted. The developed field pea module was also able to accurately simulate biomass accumulation, leaf area index <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> across the different seasons <b>and</b> experimental sites. <b>Biomass</b> accumulation was simulated with a RMSD of 555, 719 and 208 kg/ha, respectively in experiments in SA, WA <b>and</b> China. Observed <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> ranged from 1000 to 3000 kg/ha and were also well simulated with a RMSD of 253 kg/ha. The above results suggest that the developed APSIM-field pea module can be used for assessing agronomic management options and quantifying potential yields for different environmental and soil conditions...|$|R
