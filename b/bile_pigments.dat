40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{possibility}} of porphyrin to become <b>bile</b> <b>pigment</b> precursors, the relations between free porphyrin in erythrocytes, especially protoporphyrin, and intracorpuscular <b>bile</b> <b>pigment</b> precursors were experimentally observed. The results were as follows: 1. A part of protoporphyrin which increased was observed to change quickly into <b>bile</b> <b>pigment</b> precursors in the erythrocytes of a phlebotomized anemic or phenylhydrazine HC 1 administered rabbits where reticulocytosis occurred. 2. This transformation of protoporphyrin into <b>bile</b> <b>pigment</b> precursors were also observed in preserving canine erythrocytes where reticulocytosis was caused by phlebotomies. 3. Judging from the variations of intracorpuscular easily split off blood iron, it seemed appropriate to consider that this transformation occurred after the formation of hems or hemoglobin. In the above experiment, however, of preserving erythrocytes of a phlebotomized anemic dog, the plainly direct transformation of protoporphyrin into <b>bile</b> <b>pigment</b> precursors were also observed. 4. In preserving canine erythrocytes {{with or without the}} addition of ascorbic acid, the increase of protoporphyrin and of <b>bile</b> <b>pigment</b> precursors were also observed.

25|$|Mixed ("Brown Pigment") stones {{typically}} contain 20–80% cholesterol (or 30–70%, {{according to}} the Japanese- classification system). Other common constituents are calcium carbonate, palmitate phosphate, bilirubin and other <b>bile</b> <b>pigments</b> (calcium bilirubinate, calcium palmitate and calcium stearate). Because of their calcium content, they are often radiographically visible. They typically arise secondary to infection of the biliary tract which results in the release of β-glucuronidase (by injured hepatocytes and bacteria) which hydrolyzes bilirubin glucuronides and increases the amount of unconjugated bilirubin in bile.

25|$|<b>Bile</b> <b>pigments</b> such as biliverdin possess {{significant}} anti-mutagenic and antioxidant {{properties and}} therefore may fulfil a useful physiological function. Biliverdin and bilirubin {{have been shown}} to be potent scavengers of peroxyl radicals. They have also been shown to inhibit the effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic amines, and oxidants — all of which are mutagens. Some studies have found that people with higher concentration levels of bilirubin and biliverdin in their bodies have a lower frequency of cancer and cardiovascular disease. It has been suggested that biliverdin — as well as many other tetrapyrrolic pigments — may function as an HIV-1 protease inhibitor as well as having beneficial effects in asthma though further research is needed to confirm these results. There are currently no practical implications for using biliverdin in the treatment of any disease.|$|E

The following results were obtained: 1. Studies of the fluorescent micro-quantitative analysis {{made it clear that}} <b>bile</b> <b>pigment</b> precursors in erythrocytes can be determined in the 0. 1 - 5. 0 μg/ml biliverdin chloroform solution. Observing its absorption spectrum and fluorescent spectral characteristics, it was also made clear that all the <b>bile</b> <b>pigment</b> precursors were determined by the fluorescence of choleterin zincic complex salt. 2. Gardikas' method of extracting intracorpuscular <b>bile</b> <b>pigment</b> precursors under an anaerobic condition without adding ascorbic acid proved to be better than that of R. Lemberg of extracting by adding ascorbic acid under an aerobic condition. 3. Among normal erythrocytes of various animals were found no significant specific differences, the amount of <b>bile</b> <b>pigment</b> precursors being about 15 μg/Hb. 4. When dog's erythrocytes were iucubated at 37 ℃. after the addition of ascorbic acid, <b>bile</b> <b>pigment</b> precursors in them attained to a remarkably great amount within several hours. This is considered to have resulted from the action of ascorbic acid in choleglobin formation in erythrocytes. 5. 4 hours after phenylhydrazine HCl was administered to a rabbit, the amount of <b>bile</b> <b>pigment</b> precursors in erythrocytes in circulating blood began to increase and attained to its maximum in 4 - 48 hours. The amount of easily split off blood iron also increased in parallel with it. 6. When canine blood was taken in A. C.

The amount of easily split off blood iron showed a similar variations. 7.

From the above results the following conclusions were drawn. <b>Bile</b> <b>pigment</b> precursors which are usually observed in normal erythrocytes are increased by chemicals such as ascorbic acid and phenylhydrazine HCl, or by preservation, while in the case of anemia by phlebotomies where immature erythrocytes increase, the amount of <b>bile</b> <b>pigment</b> precursors decreases.

40|$|The {{intravenous}} injection of red cells {{obtained from the}} same animal and laked by distilled water is similar to certain types of hemolysis which result in hematogenous jaundice.

In the last experiments there had been no operative manipulation of the liver and the <b>bile</b> <b>pigment</b> could not have escaped from the liver and have been absorbed by the circulation above the diaphragm; for example, by the thoracic duct. It is possible that the endothelium of the blood vessels is the agent which brings about the rapid change of hemoglobin to <b>bile</b> <b>pigment.</b> This mechanism probably comes into play when there has been a destruction of many red cells with much hemoglobin free in the plasma.

40|$|Iron is {{eliminated}} in the bile of normal dogs {{at a low}} but quite constant rate, 0. 2 mg. per day.
