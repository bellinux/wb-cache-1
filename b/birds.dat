5|$|<b>Birds</b> are a {{significant}} hazard to aircraft, {{but it is difficult}} to keep them away from airfields. Several methods have been explored. Stunning <b>birds</b> by feeding them a bait containing stupefying substances has been tried, and it may be possible to reduce their numbers on airfields by reducing the number of earthworms and other invertebrates by soil treatment. Leaving the grass long on airfields rather than mowing it is also a deterrent to <b>birds.</b> Sonic nets are being trialled; these produce sounds that <b>birds</b> find distracting and seem effective at keeping <b>birds</b> away from affected areas.|$|E
5|$|<b>Birds</b> {{feature in}} a wide variety of art forms, {{including}} in painting, sculpture, poetry and prose, film and fashion. <b>Birds</b> also appear in music as well as traditional dance and ballet.

5|$|<b>Birds</b> have {{featured}} in culture and art since prehistoric times, {{when they were}} represented in early cave paintings. Some <b>birds</b> have been perceived as monsters, including the mythological Roc and the Māori's legendary Pouākai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans. <b>Birds</b> were later used as symbols of power, as in the magnificent Peacock Throne of the Mughal and Persian emperors. With the advent of scientific interest in <b>birds,</b> many paintings of <b>birds</b> were commissioned for books.|$|E
5|$|<b>Birds</b> {{have two}} sexes: either female or male. The sex of <b>birds</b> is {{determined}} by the Z and W sex chromosomes, rather than by the X and Y chromosomes present in mammals.

5|$|<b>Birds</b> {{occupy a}} wide range of {{ecological}} positions. While some <b>birds</b> are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements. Even within a single habitat, such as a forest, the niches occupied by different species of <b>birds</b> vary, with some species feeding in the forest canopy, others beneath the canopy, and still others on the forest floor. Forest <b>birds</b> may be insectivores, frugivores, and nectarivores. Aquatic <b>birds</b> generally feed by fishing, plant eating, and piracy or kleptoparasitism. <b>Birds</b> of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other <b>birds,</b> while vultures are specialised scavengers. Avivores are animals that are specialised at preying on <b>birds.</b>|$|E

5|$|Mangroves {{also serve}} as {{excellent}} rookeries for <b>birds.</b> Wading <b>birds,</b> such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources and the protection offered from most prey. Thousands of <b>birds</b> can nest in the mangroves at once, making a noisy and messy colony, but their droppings fertilize the mangrove trees. Shorebirds like rails, terns and gulls; diving <b>birds</b> such as pelicans and grebes; and <b>birds</b> of prey such as ospreys, hawks and vultures are {{among the more than}} 100 species of <b>birds</b> that use Everglades mangrove trees to raise their young.|$|E
5|$|More recently, <b>birds</b> have {{appeared}} in books illustrated by some exceptional artists, producing images that were accurate and beautiful, and that made use of the latest available printing techniques. The wood engraver Thomas Bewick's 1797–1804 A History of British <b>Birds</b> brought affordable illustrations {{to the public for}} the first time, and the book formed in effect the first field guide to <b>birds,</b> while John James Audubon's enormous and impressive images of <b>birds</b> in his 1827–1838 <b>Birds</b> of America are among the most admired by art critics and by collectors: early editions fetch among the highest prices paid for any printed books. The ornithologist John Gould's bird illustrations, in books such as A Century of <b>Birds</b> hitherto unfigured from the Himalaya Mountains (1830–1833) with 80 plates, and his 7-volume The <b>Birds</b> of Australia (1840–1848) with 600 plates, related directly to his research, were both beautiful and scientifically useful.|$|E

5|$|Most house sparrows do {{not move}} {{more than a few}} {{kilometres}} during their lifetimes. However, limited migration occurs in all regions. Some young <b>birds</b> disperse long distances, especially on coasts, and mountain <b>birds</b> move to lower elevations in winter. Two subspecies, P. d. bactrianus and P. d. parkini, are predominantly migratory. Unlike the <b>birds</b> in sedentary populations that migrate, <b>birds</b> of migratory subspecies prepare for migration by putting on weight.|$|E

5|$|The <b>birds</b> aggressively {{defend their}} nests and {{surrounding}} areas against other <b>birds</b> and animals. When a predator is persistent, mockingbirds from neighboring territories may be summoned by distinct calls {{to join the}} defense.

5|$|The clade Oviraptorosauria is {{generally}} regarded {{as a group of}} non-avian (or non-bird) theropod dinosaurs, and their similarity to <b>birds</b> (Aves) has often been noted. Fossils of oviraptorosaurs in the family Caenagnathidae have historically been confused with those of <b>birds,</b> and some researchers have {{gone so far as to}} consider oviraptorosaurs as a whole more closely related to <b>birds</b> than to other non-avian dinosaurs. In 2002 Lü and colleagues used the then unnamed Nemegtomaia to show similarities between <b>birds</b> and oviraptorosaurs, and found the latter group to be closer to <b>birds</b> than to bird-like dinosaurs such as dromaeosaurs. They therefore concluded that oviraptorosaurs were flightless <b>birds</b> rather than non-avian dinosaurs, and noted that the boundary between <b>birds</b> and dinosaurs was becoming more and more difficult to delineate. Other researchers have instead found dromaeosaurs and troodontids to be most closely related to <b>birds,</b> together forming the group Paraves; oviraptorosaurs, therizinosaurs, and alvarezsaurs are just outside this group. The wider group that includes oviraptorosaurs and Paraves is called Pennaraptora, and this group is defined by the presence of pennaceous feathers (feathers with a stalk).|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} examine the process of a rotary engine primary {{compressor}} impacted by <b>bird,</b> a finite element model of a <b>bird</b> impacted on plate is developed with the explicit code PAM-CRASH. The smooth particles hydrodynamic (SPH) method is used to simulate the <b>bird</b> because of the SPH method showing no signs of instability and correctly modeling the breaking-up of the <b>bird</b> into particles. Good agreement between the simulation results and experimental results indicates that the numerical method of <b>bird</b> strike {{used in the present}} paper is reasonable. Then a rotary engine primary compressor impacted by three different configurations <b>bird</b> named straight-ended cylinder <b>bird,</b> quadrangular <b>bird,</b> hemispherical-ended <b>bird</b> are investigated using the numerical simulation method. It is found that the whole process of <b>bird</b> strike sustained about 3. 5 ms and the <b>bird</b> is slashed by blade during the strike. The geometry configuration of <b>bird</b> affected the displacement and von Mises stress of some blades severely, just because the breaking <b>bird’s</b> mass is affected by the <b>bird’s</b> configuration. In the event of <b>bird</b> striking on the site of “up” some blades may develop plastic deformation and it is very adverse for the safety work of the engine...|$|R

5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{displays}} are seen, with aggressive behaviours outnumbering pro-social ones. Crouching low and uttering quiet begging calls are common signs of submission. The manus flutter is a submissive display where a magpie will flutter its primary feathers in its wings. A magpie, particularly a juvenile, may also fall, roll over on its back and expose its underparts. <b>Birds</b> may fluff up their flank feathers as an aggressive display or preceding an attack. Young <b>birds</b> display various forms of play behaviour, either by themselves or in groups, with older <b>birds</b> often initiating the proceedings with juveniles. These may involve picking up, manipulating or tugging at various objects such as sticks, rocks or bits of wire, and handing them to other <b>birds.</b> A bird may pick up a feather or leaf and flying off with it, with other <b>birds</b> pursuing and attempting {{to bring down the}} leader by latching onto its tail feathers. <b>Birds</b> may jump on each other and even engage in mock fighting. Play may even take place with other species such as blue-faced honeyeaters and Australasian pipits.|$|E
