25|$|SHAC {{was founded}} in November 1999 by Greg Avery; his second wife, Natasha Avery (née Dellemagne); and his first wife, Heather Nicholson (née James). Avery and Nicholson had been {{involved}} in previous high-profile campaigns against facilities in the UK that <b>bred</b> <b>animals</b> for laboratories. In 1997, after a ten-month campaign, they caused the closure of Consort Kennels, which bred beagles for animal research. Later that year, they started Save the Hill Grove Cats against Hill Grove farm in Oxfordshire, which bred cats for laboratories. The farm closed after two years.|$|E
25|$|Barking geckos {{were common}} in shrublands {{all around the}} Wellington region up until the 1960s and 1970s but populations have {{declined}} enormously since then. DOC has tried to establish populations of this species on Mana Island {{but there are so}} few animals left in wild populations in the region that they have had to resort to transferring animals taken either from the jaws of pet cats or captive <b>bred</b> <b>animals</b> from private collections. Both the Naultinus released on Mana and a natural population on Kapiti Island have failed to thrive, which is mysterious, because these habitats are rodent free. One suggested cause about which little research has been done is vespid wasp predation, as these insects have been observed killing both adult and baby Naultinus. Naultinus gemmeus are known from the mainland of Southland from a few sightings by members of the public but despite numerous searches in recent years, not a single animal has been sighted or photographed here and it is speculated that this population is either critically endangered or already functionally extinct.|$|E
60|$|In {{the early}} part of this chapter it was shown that the {{crossing}} of individuals belonging to distinct families of the same race, or to different races or species, gives increased size and constitutional vigour to the offspring, and, except in the case of crossed species, increased fertility. The evidence rests on the universal testimony of breeders (for it should be observed that I am not here speaking of the evil results of close interbreeding), and is practically exemplified in the higher value of cross- <b>bred</b> <b>animals</b> for immediate consumption. The good results of crossing have also been demonstrated with some animals and with numerous plants, by actual weight and measurement. Although animals of pure blood will obviously be deteriorated by crossing, as far as their characteristic qualities are concerned, there seems to be no exception to the rule that advantages of the kind just mentioned are thus gained, even when there has not been any previous close interbreeding; and the rule applies to such animals as cattle and sheep, which can long resist breeding in-and-in between the nearest blood-relations.|$|E
50|$|The colt {{was entered}} into the September 2009 Keeneland Sales as a yearling. The Team Valor {{partnership}} that <b>bred</b> <b>Animal</b> Kingdom sold him for $100,000 to a new Team Valor partnership who planned to race him. The {{chief executive of the}} partnership is Barry Irwin. The original breeding partnership was dissolved.|$|R
60|$|Before the dazed cook of the Seamew could {{collect his}} {{scattered}} senses a pattering sounded on the stairs, and a bulldog came unobtrusively into the room. It {{was a perfectly}} <b>bred</b> <b>animal,</b> {{with at least a}} dozen points about it calling for notice and admiration, but all that the cook noticed was the excellent preservation of its teeth.|$|R

60|$|That any evil {{directly}} {{follows from}} the closest interbreeding has been denied by many persons; but rarely by any practical breeder; and never, as far as I know, by one who has largely <b>bred</b> <b>animals</b> which propagate their kind quickly. Many physiologists attribute the evil exclusively to the combination and consequent increase of morbid tendencies common to both parents; {{and that this is}} an active source of mischief there can be no doubt. It is unfortunately too notorious that men and various domestic animals endowed with a wretched constitution, and with a strong hereditary disposition to disease, if not actually ill, are fully capable of procreating their kind. Close interbreeding, on the other hand, often induces sterility; and this indicates something quite distinct from the augmentation of morbid tendencies common to both parents. The evidence immediately to be given convinces me that it is a great law of nature, that all organic beings profit from an occasional cross with individuals not closely related to them in blood; and that, on the other hand, long-continued close interbreeding is injurious.|$|E
6000|$|This {{view of the}} latency in each {{generation}} of all the characters which appear through reversion, is also supported by their actual presence in some cases during early youth alone, or by their more frequent appearance and greater distinctness at this age than during maturity. We have seen that this {{is often the case}} with the stripes on the legs and faces of the several species of the horse genus. The Himalayan rabbit, when crossed, sometimes produces offspring which revert to the parent silver-grey breed, and we have seen that in purely <b>bred</b> <b>animals</b> pale-grey fur occasionally reappears during early youth. Black cats, we may feel assured, would occasionally produce by reversion tabbies; and on young black kittens, with a pedigree (13/66. Carl Vogt 'Lectures on Man' English translation 1864 page 411.) known to have been long pure, faint traces of stripes may almost always be seen which afterwards disappear. Hornless Suffolk cattle occasionally produce by reversion horned animals; and Youatt (13/67. 'On Cattle' page 174.) asserts that even in hornless individuals [...] "the rudiment of a horn may be often felt at an early age." ...|$|E

50|$|Its larvae (caterpillars) are {{commonly}} known as waxworms like those of its relatives, though they are not the particular waxworms often <b>bred</b> as <b>animal</b> food. They are a common grain-feeding pest found around the world, feeding on cereals and similar products.|$|R
50|$|A leguar or lepjag is {{the hybrid}} {{of a male}} leopard and a female jaguar. The terms jagulep and lepjag are often used interchangeably {{regardless}} of which animal was the sire. Numerous lepjags have been <b>bred</b> as <b>animal</b> actors, as they are more tractable than jaguars.|$|R

50|$|North American trophy hunting {{should not}} be {{confused}} with canned hunting or vanity hunting which involves the shooting of genetically manipulated and selectively <b>bred</b> <b>animals</b> for the sole purpose of collecting an animal for display.

5000|$|Josef, {{his oldest}} son Joe and Rob {{established}} a crocodile farm at the Edward River Station on the Cape York peninsula in Queensland.

60|$|He {{turned and}} came {{up the hill to}} get another start. Partner took a turn on a stump, and all unmindful of it the Rat whirled and made a mighty spring. He {{reached the end of the}} rope and his hand-spring became a {{vaulting}} somersault. He lay, unable to rise, spatting the wind, breathing heavily. Such annoying energy I have never seen. We were now mad, muddy, and very resolute. We held him down till he lay quite still. Any well-considered, properly <b>bred</b> <b>animal</b> would have been ground to bone dust by such wondrous acrobatic movements. He was skinned in one or two places, the hair was scraped from his nose, his tongue bled, but all these were mere scratches. When we repacked him he walked off comparatively unhurt.|$|R
40|$|The sex {{ratios and}} the {{emergence}} patterns of the European rabbit flea <b>bred</b> under <b>animal</b> house conditions were examined. An overall preponderance of female fleas was found. This {{was due to the}} greater preponderance of female fleas in the primary emergence, whereas the sex ratios in the secondary emergence were about 1 : 1...|$|R
5000|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature has {{assessed}} {{many of the}} species as [...] "Critically Endangered" [...] (Peltophryne florentinoi, Peltophryne fluviatica, and Peltophryne lemur) or [...] "Endangered" [...] (Peltophryne cataulaciceps, Peltophryne fracta, and Peltophryne longinasus). The only surviving wild population of Peltophryne lemur has been supported by captive <b>bred</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Cropping {{of large}} {{portions}} of the pinnae of other animals is rare, although the clipping of identifying shapes in the pinnae of livestock, called earmarks, was common prior {{to the introduction of}} compulsory ear tags. [...] Removal of portions of the ear of laboratory mice for identification, i.e. ear-notching, is still used. The practice of cropping for cosmetic purposes is rare in non-canines, although some selectively <b>bred</b> <b>animals</b> have naturally small ears which can be mistaken for cropping.|$|E
5000|$|Khirbet al-Malih {{dates back}} to the Ottoman period of rule in Palestine when Turkish people first settled it. The current {{residents}} are from the Daraghmah clan who have dwelt in the area for 50 years. They came from nearby Tubas, and as well as Hebron in search of grazing and water as they were farmers and <b>bred</b> <b>animals.</b> Al-Malih means [...] "salty" [...] and the village's name is derives from the nearby al-Malih spring in, which is salty water.|$|E

50|$|This rearing {{behavior}} makes harlequins {{among the}} most difficult poison dart frogs to raise in captivity. As a result, they are not widely found on the domestic pet market, and those available may be illegally smuggled imports rather than legally bred domestic animals. Wild-caught dart frogs are often stressed, require more care, have a much higher fatality rate, and may also be toxic and dangerous to handle. A few domestically <b>bred</b> <b>animals</b> are nevertheless available, and are highly sought-after in the pet trade.|$|E
50|$|Once {{exported}} from Madagascar {{in great}} numbers, trade in this species {{has since been}} heavily restricted. They are, however, quite prolific in captivity, and captive <b>bred</b> <b>animals</b> are relatively inexpensive and easy {{to find in the}} exotic pet trade. Though their size makes them more suited to someone experienced with large constrictors, they have a typically docile nature, and readily feed on rats. The main concern is that they are prone to stress, which can sometimes cause them to stop eating or contribute to other health issues.|$|E
60|$|The next {{scene was}} a puzzler, for in came another animal, on all-fours this time, {{with a new}} sort of tail and long ears. A gray shawl {{concealed}} its face, but an inquisitive sunbeam betrayed the glitter as of goggles under the fringe. On its back rode a small gentleman in Eastern costume, who appeared to find some difficulty in keeping his seat as his steed jogged along. Suddenly a spirit appeared, all in white, with long newspaper wings upon its back and golden locks about its face. Singularly enough, the beast beheld this apparition and backed instantly, but the rider evidently saw nothing and whipped up unmercifully, also unsuccessfully, for the spirit stood directly in the path, and the amiable beast would not budge a foot. A lively skirmish followed, which ended in the Eastern gentleman being upset into a sweet-fern bush, while the better <b>bred</b> <b>animal</b> abased itself before the shining one.|$|R

50|$|Plenty {{of animal}} bones imply that dwellers of the hillfort <b>bred</b> {{domestic}} <b>animals,</b> predominantly horses. Pigs, cows, sheep, goats and dogs were also held. Dominance of horses differs Khotiv hillfort from other hillforts of forest steppe, which {{were dominated by}} cattle or pigs. Its inhabitants hunted wild boars, deers, elks, bears and beavers, sometimes aurochs and hares. Sporadic bones of turtles, foxes, geese, ducks, crows and men were found.|$|R
50|$|Brooke never {{sought to}} blame the men and boys who through poverty and lack of knowledge, had failed their animals. The ‘tragic sight’ of the locally <b>bred</b> <b>animals</b> that {{appeared}} before the Buying Committee made her realise that a free hospital was needed - to which every poor owner could bring what might be his family’s sole earner, and obtain expert help and advice at {{the first signs of}} trouble instead of waiting hopelessly. She had set up a separate fund almost from the start. She called this The Animal Assistance Fund.|$|E
50|$|In 1991 a Eurasian lynx {{was shot}} near Norwich, Norfolk. It had killed around 15 sheep within two weeks. The story was only {{reported}} in 2003, and the stuffed {{body of the}} lynx is allegedly now {{in the possession of}} a collector. For many years this incident was considered to have been a hoax, particularly by the hunting community, but in March 2006 a police report confirmed that the case was true. It was probably an escapee from a facility in the area that <b>bred</b> <b>animals,</b> including Eurasian lynxes.|$|E
