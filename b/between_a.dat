5|$|Equine {{species can}} crossbreed with each other. The most common hybrid is the mule, a cross <b>between</b> <b>a</b> male donkey {{and a female}} horse. With rare exceptions, these hybrids are sterile and cannot reproduce. A related hybrid, a hinny, is a cross <b>between</b> <b>a</b> male horse and a female donkey. Other hybrids include the zorse, a cross <b>between</b> <b>a</b> zebra and a horse and a zonkey or zedonk, a hybrid of a zebra and a donkey. In areas where Grévy's zebras are {{sympatric}} with plains zebras, fertile hybrids do occur.|$|E
5|$|Familiar {{examples}} of equid hybrids are the mule, a cross <b>between</b> <b>a</b> female horse and a male donkey, and the hinny, a cross <b>between</b> <b>a</b> female donkey and a male horse. Pairs of complementary types like the mule and hinny are called reciprocal hybrids.|$|E

5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} containing hydrogen ions (H+) {{are classified}} as acids, and those containing electropositive cations and basic anions ions hydroxide (OH−) or oxide (O2−) {{are classified as}} bases. Other ionic compounds are known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions. If the compound {{is the result of}} a reaction <b>between</b> <b>a</b> strong acid and a weak base, the result is an acidic salt. If it {{is the result of a}} reaction <b>between</b> <b>a</b> strong base and a weak acid, the result is a basic salt. If it is the result of a reaction <b>between</b> <b>a</b> strong acid and a strong base, the result is a neutral salt. Weak acids reacted with weak bases can produce ionic compounds with both the conjugate base ion and conjugate acid ion, such as ammonium acetate.|$|E

40|$|The Casimir-Polder {{potential}} for interaction <b>between</b> <b>an</b> excited atom and a ground-state {{one in the}} retarded case obtained {{with the help of}} perturbation technique drops as R^- 2 with the distance between the atoms [E. A. Power, T. Thirunamachandran, Phys. Rev. A, 47, 2539 (1993) ]. It results in diverdent integrals for interaction <b>between</b> <b>an</b> excited atom and a dilute gas medium. We investigate interaction between two atoms embedded in a dielectric medium with the help of non-perturbative approach. We take into account absorption of photons in the medium. This approach solves the problem of divergence. We consider interaction <b>between</b> <b>an</b> excited atom and a planar dielectric gas medium of ground-state atoms. We show that the retarded interaction <b>between</b> <b>an</b> excited atom and a gas of ground-state atoms is not oscillating but follows a simple power law. We show that to obtain coventional non-retarded expression for the van der Waals force <b>between</b> <b>an</b> excited atom and a dilute gas the distance between the atom and the interface should be much smaller than the free mean pass of a photon in the medium. Interaction <b>between</b> <b>an</b> excited atom and a hemisphere of ground-state atoms is considered. Comment: 23 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
