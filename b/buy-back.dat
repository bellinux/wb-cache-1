40|$|Our article {{investigates the}} use of {{unlimited}} <b>buy-backs,</b> which have been permitted in Australia since September 1999, using data over the period 2000 – 2009. We discuss a number of inconsistencies between the Corporations Act, ASIC regulations and ASX requirements and the confusion surrounding the terms continuous and indefinite duration. In particular, we note that allowing for <b>buy-backs</b> of unlimited duration appears to {{be at odds with}} {{the use of}} a 12 month time period in the operative 10 / 12 rule in the Corporations Act. We discover that incongruent information has often been reported by companies using unlimited <b>buy-backs</b> and that companies do not always conform with ASX requirements such as the need to disclose active <b>buy-backs</b> in corporate annual reports. We provide examples of corporate practices to illustrate our points. We find that most unlimited <b>buy-backs</b> are completed within a 12 month period. Further, we find little difference in the structural characteristics of unlimited and defined period <b>buy-backs.</b> Our results lead us to question the reasons advanced for unlimited period <b>buy-backs.</b> We recommend that the practice of allowing unlimited <b>buy-backs</b> be discontinued and that a 12 month maximum time period be enforced for all <b>buy-backs.</b> This will remove the uncertainty inherent in <b>buy-backs</b> having unlimited duration and improve the information content of <b>buy-backs</b> in general...|$|R
40|$|Share <b>buy-backs</b> are {{undertaken}} in the {{ordinary course of business}} by EU issuers and each year many of these issuers become the target of a tender offer. The question of significance is whether a target's share <b>buy-backs</b> may obstruct a tender offer in a manipulative manner. The current EU legislative regime, namely the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR, EU 596 / 2014), lacks clarity in this regard, as it includes an open-ended safe harbour rule under which <b>buy-backs</b> satisfying certain legislative criteria are exempt from the manipulation and insider trading prohibitions. This thesis seeks to investigate whether open market <b>buy-backs</b> by a takeover target constitute prohibited market manipulation under the MAR. The secondary purpose of this thesis is to form an interpretative framework for establishing the conditions under which <b>buy-backs</b> carried out under the safe harbour rule do not constitute market manipulation, and thirdly, when <b>buy-backs</b> that are engineered to technically comply with the safe harbour rule are so abusive as to warrant new regulation or teleological interpretation of existing rules. These questions are approached using a law and economics-oriented research method, applying economic concepts to the normative analysis of law and the empirical context. Comparative law is used as a secondary method to gain insights from regulation in the United States. Taking into account both the textual formulation of the US rules and the reasons for adopting them helps to evaluate EU regulation. The evaluation of the regulatory regime focuses on the disclosure of information related to <b>buy-backs</b> in determining when information has been sufficiently disclosed to reduce the gravest of information asymmetries. In addition, the potential coercive effect of target's <b>buy-backs</b> is studied to find out whether the <b>buy-backs</b> carry such market power that might fall in the scope of the prohibition on market manipulation. Particular attention is given to assessing when issuers should feel confident in carrying out <b>buy-backs</b> even during control contests and, conversely, when circumstances deny them the benefit of the safe harbour...|$|R

25|$|In February 2007 the {{government}} unveiled its new buyback-contract formula, which significantly extended {{the length of}} the contracts to as long as 20 years. The <b>buy-back</b> scheme is a formula used by the Iranian government to attract foreign investment. Following the end of the Iran–Iraq War in 1988, Iran faced a major problem: it needed foreign investment if it did not want to lose its vital income from the oil and gas industry, yet its revolutionary ideology and Constitution forbid granting “concessions”. A compromise solution was found in 1989 with the First Five-Year Economic, Social and Cultural Development Plan. Under Note 29 of the said plan, the Iranian government is allowed to employ “buybacks” in its effort to meet the industrial and mineral needs in connection with exports, production and investment. Put in laymen terms, a <b>buy-back</b> transaction is a method of trade where plants, machinery, production equipment and technology is supplied (by a domestic or foreign private firm), in exchange for the goods that will be produced directly or indirectly by means of such facilities.|$|E
