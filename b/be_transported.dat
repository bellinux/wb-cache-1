5|$|An alloy of {{aluminium}} and gallium in pellet form added to {{water can be}} used to generate hydrogen. The process also produces alumina, but the expensive gallium, which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used. This has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy, as hydrogen can be produced on-site and does not need to <b>be</b> <b>transported.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 76% of Russia’s exports {{depend on}} resources extracted (or manufactured) in Siberia.

5|$|Cylinder valves must {{be closed}} whilst in transit and checked {{that there are}} no leaks.

5|$|Mining and {{metallurgy}} developed further {{during the}} 16th century, and technical progress {{took place in}} various commercial applications. Great quantities of exported agricultural and forest products floated down the rivers to <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> through ports and land routes. This resulted in a positive trade balance for Poland throughout the 16th century. Imports from the West included industrial products, luxury products and fabrics.|$|E
5|$|The M22 Locust, officially Light Tank (Airborne), M22, was an American-designed {{airborne}} light tank {{which was}} produced during World War II. The Locust began development in 1941 after the British War Office {{requested that the}} American government design a purpose-built airborne light tank which could <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> by glider into battle to support British airborne forces. The War Office had originally selected the Light Tank Mark VII Tetrarch light tank {{for use by the}} airborne forces, but it had not been designed with that exact purpose in mind so the War Office believed that a purpose-built tank would be required to replace it. The United States Ordnance Department was asked to produce this replacement, which in turn selected Marmon-Herrington to design and build a prototype airborne tank in May 1941. The prototype was designated the Light Tank T9 (Airborne), and was designed so that it could <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> underneath a Douglas C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft, although its dimensions also allowed it to fit inside a General Aircraft Hamilcar glider.|$|E

50|$|Potocytosis {{is a type}} of receptor-mediated {{endocytosis}} in which small molecules <b>are</b> <b>transported</b> across the plasma membrane of a cell. The molecules <b>are</b> <b>transported</b> by caveolae (rather than clathrin-coated vesicles) and are deposited directly into the cytosol.|$|R
50|$|According to the Swedish Red Cross a {{total of}} 15,345 prisoners were saved, of these 7,795 were Scandinavian and 7,550 from other countries. Around 1,500 German-Swedes <b>were</b> <b>transported</b> to Sweden. A total of 2,000 prisoners <b>were</b> <b>transported</b> from Neuengamme to other camps so that space was {{available}} for Scandinavian prisoners. Four hundred French prisoners <b>were</b> <b>transported</b> from Neuengamme or left in Theresienstadt as {{they could not be}} delivered to the camp in Flossenbürg.|$|R
5|$|The cytosol has {{no single}} {{function}} and is instead {{the site of}} multiple cell processes. Examples of these processes include signal transduction from the cell membrane to sites within the cell, such as the cell nucleus, or organelles. This compartment is also the site {{of many of the}} processes of cytokinesis, after the breakdown of the nuclear membrane in mitosis. Another major function of cytosol is to transport metabolites from their site of production to where they are used. This is relatively simple for water-soluble molecules, such as amino acids, which can diffuse rapidly through the cytosol. However, hydrophobic molecules, such as fatty acids or sterols, can <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> through the cytosol by specific binding proteins, which shuttle these molecules between cell membranes. Molecules taken into the cell by endocytosis or on their way to be secreted can also <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> through the cytosol inside vesicles, which are small spheres of lipids that are moved along the cytoskeleton by motor proteins.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{means of}} transport during the Olympics was by railway. Spectators heading to Birkebeineren were transported by train to Hovemoen Station on the Dovre Line, and would then <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> by shuttle bus to the stadium. In addition, spectators from certain areas were transported by bus directly to the stadium.|$|E
5|$|The {{service was}} {{provided}} by a fleet of 108 carriages manufactured for the UERL in the United States by the American Car and Foundry Company and assembled in Manchester. They were transported to London by rail but because the BS had no external railway connections, the carriages then had to <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> across the city on horse-drawn wagons to their destination at London Road depot.|$|E
50|$|The Incas transported {{agricultural}} goods by llama caravan. For example, maize grown {{at the state}} farm of Cochabamba <b>was</b> <b>transported</b> first to the regional center of Paria. Some was stored there and some <b>was</b> <b>transported</b> on to Cuzco.|$|R

5|$|Unlike birds, {{many small}} insects are swept {{along by the}} {{prevailing}} winds {{although many of the}} larger insects are known to make migrations. Aphids are known to <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> long distances by low-level jet streams. As such, fine line patterns associated with converging winds within weather radar imagery, like the WSR-88D radar network, often represent large groups of insects.|$|E
5|$|A crypt was {{constructed}} beneath the former Chapel of St. Anthony in 2009 {{to house the}} remains of former Bishops of Hong Kong. This consists of two Vicar Apostolics, Timoleon Raimondi and Dominic Pozzoni, and all five deceased bishops—Enrico Valtorta, Lorenzo Bianchi, Francis Hsu, Peter Lei and John Wu. Bianchi's remains were interred later than the others {{due to the fact}} that he was buried in Milan. Thus, the diocese had to apply for permission to allow for some of his remains to <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> back to Hong Kong; the request was eventually granted.|$|E
5|$|A {{shortage}} of aircraft {{played a role}} in transporting the task force to France, which had to be divided into two large groups and a small glider group for the British. On D-Day the first large group would <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> to France by 394 aircraft and eighty gliders. A second group of 325 aircraft and 270 gliders would arrive in the afternoon. The smaller British group consisting of the 2nd Parachute Brigade's glider forces would arrive shortly after the first group in the morning. In total 9,099 troops, 221 vehicles and 213 artillery guns would be delivered to France during Operation Rugby.|$|E
