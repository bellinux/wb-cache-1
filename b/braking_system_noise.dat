40|$|Laser {{holographic}} {{methods have}} been successfully used to produce animations showing the out-of-plane vibrations {{that take place in}} both the disc and pad of a real <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> generating <b>noise</b> (squeal). A series of holograms made at different times in the cycle of vibration were used to give the data on which the animations were based. Further {{it has been shown that}} mathematical approximations made to the fringe patterns obtained in the holograms by this method give phase and amplitude information about the wave motion involved. It establishes the existence of travelling waves on the brake disc with a speed given by the angular frequency of the noise divided by the mode order. This approach has now been extended to examine a time- related series of holograms of the disc rim of a <b>brake</b> <b>system.</b> From the data obtained from these holograms it has been possible to develop animations that show the in-plane vibration in the disc of a <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> producing <b>noise.</b> Estimates of the amplitude (of magnitude comparable to that of the out-of-plane motion) and phase of such vibration can also be obtained...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} passenger car disc brake noise {{has been made}} using the double pulsed laser holographic technique, developed to allow simultaneous recording of three orthographic visual images of a vibrating <b>brake</b> <b>system.</b> Mechanical measurements of parameters such as disc surface strain, torque, pad deflections, pressure and noise complement the visual images for both continuous and intermittent brake noise and enable phase relationships of the component parts to be determined. Visual images of the vibrational characteristics of a noisy brake show the disc {{to be in a}} bending mode with diametral modes. The pad is seen to vibrate in a variety of modes such as bending, torsion and often a combination of both and that pad end flutter is shown to make a significant contribution to <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> <b>noise.</b> A series of holograms of the brake emitting first an intermittent noise and then a continuous noise show that the disc waveform is not stationary and that it is moving with respect to both the calliper and the disc. Fringe movement is shown to take place when a single hologram is viewed from different positions which provides supporting evidence that the waveform is not stationary in space. Most recent tests show that the waveform does rotate about the disc at a rate equivalent to the frequency of vibration divided by the diametral mode order...|$|R
40|$|Previous work on {{generating}} animations {{from real}} disc <b>brake</b> <b>systems</b> generating <b>noise</b> (squeal) has been consolidated and developed. Using {{the method of}} double pulsed laser interferometry a series of holograms (typically ten per half cycle) can be recorded from the brake during a cycle of excitation. From these holograms {{a considerable amount of}} data can be obtained about the vibration of the disc and pad surfaces. Standard methods from image processing and algorithms developed to investigate hologram fringe lines can be used to generate three-dimensional representations of the surfaces. Furthermore although part of the disc surface and even more of the pad surface are obscured by the calliper, etc., it has been possible to form a reliable numerical reconstruction of the whole disc and pad surfaces partly by using standard mathematical approximation techniques and partly by intelligent extrapolation of the available data. From these an extension of previous animations to show the full disc and pad surfaces undergoing vibration can be obtained. Using a Fourier analysis of the numerical data indicates a possible way to construct reliable mathematical models of real disc <b>brake</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of in-plane vibration of a noisy disc brake is both {{difficult to measure}} and difficult to verify. In the past {{there has been a}} reluctance by researchers to accept the contribution of a displacement parallel {{to the surface of the}} object, or in-plane displacement, to noise generation. In addition to measuring absolute displacement it has been difficult to isolate the in-plane and out-of-plane components of displacement using either non- contact or conventional displacement measurement techniques. However within the last few years techniques have been developed to allow absolute displacement to be measured. Such systems are now commercially available but validation of these systems remains vague. In parallel with these commercial systems the technique of classical holographic interferometry has been extended to allow examination of both out-of-plane and in-plane displacement of a brake disc during noise.

Indeed, vehicle quietness and passenger comfort issues are a major concern. One of vehicle components that occasionally generate unwanted vibration and unpleasant <b>noise</b> is the <b>brake</b> <b>system.</b> <b>Brake</b> squeal <b>noise</b> is the most troublesome and irritant one to both car passenger and the environment, and is expensive to brakes and carmakers in terms of warranty costs. It is well accepted that brake squeal is due to a friction-induced dynamic instability and it frequently occurs at frequency above 1 kHz and is described as sound pressure level above 78 dB. Brake squeal has been studied over 20 years ago through experimental, analytical and numerical methods in an attempt to understand, to predict and to prevent squeal occurrence. In recent years, the finite element (FE) method has become the preferred method due to inadequacy of experimental methods in predicting squeal at early stage in the design process. However, the drawbacks of the FE method are over-predictions and missing unstable modes in the squeal frequency range. This paper attempts to improve the drawbacks by considering temperature dependent friction coefficient (T-µ dependency), which is typically neglected by many previous investigators.

The prediction of brake pedal ‘feel’ in <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> simulation has been achieved using the simulation modelling package AMESim. Each individual <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> component was modelled individually before combining them into the whole <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> {{in order to identify}} the parameters and the internal components characteristics that influence the brake pedal ‘feel’.

Axisymmetric Finite Element Analysis (using the ABAQUS software) was used to predict the behaviour of nonlinear elastomeric internal components such as the piston seal and the booster reaction disc which was then included in the AMESim simulation model. The seal model FEA highlighted the effects of master cylinder and caliper seal deformation on the brake pedal ‘feel’. The characteristics of the brake booster reaction disc were predicted by the FEA and AMESim simulation modelling and these results highlighted the importance of the nonlinear material characteristics, and their potential contribution to brake pedal ‘feel’ improvement.
