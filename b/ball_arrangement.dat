40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the regular prism tilings and {{construct}} ball packings by geodesic balls {{related to the}} above tilings in the projective model of Nil geometry. Packings are generated by action of the discrete prism groups pq 2 _ 1. We prove that these groups are realized by prism tilings in Nil space if (p,q) =(3, 6), (4, 4), (6, 3) and determine packing density formulae for geodesic ball packings generated by the above prism groups. Moreover, studying these formulae we determine the conjectured maximal dense packing arrangements and their densities and visualize them in the projective model of Nil geometry. We get a dense (conjectured locally densest) geodesic <b>ball</b> <b>arrangement</b> related to the parameters (p,q) =(6, 3) where the kissing number of the packing is 14, similarly to the densest lattice-like Nil geodesic <b>ball</b> <b>arrangement</b> investigated by the second author.

40|$|In n-dimensional {{hyperbolic}} space H^n (n> 2) {{there are}} 3 -types of spheres (balls) : the sphere, horosphere and hypersphere. If n= 2, 3 we know an universal upper bound {{of the ball}} packing densities, where each ball volume {{is related to the}} volume of the corresponding Dirichlet-Voronoi (D-V) cell. E. g. in H^ 3 the densest horoball packing is derived from the { 3, 3, 6 } Coxeter tiling consisting of ideal regular simplices T_reg^∞ with dihedral angles π/ 3. The density of this packing is δ_ 3 ^∞≈ 0. 85328 and this provides a very rough upper bound for the ball packing densities as well. However, there are no "essential" results regarding the "classical" ball packings with congruent balls, and for ball coverings either. The goal of this paper to find the extremal <b>ball</b> <b>arrangements</b> in H^ 3 with "classical balls". We consider only periodic congruent <b>ball</b> <b>arrangements</b> (for simplicity) related to the generalized, so-called complete Coxeter orthoschemes and their extended groups. In Theorems 1. 1 - 1. 2 we formulate also conjectures for the densest ball packing with density 0. 77147 [...] . and the loosest ball covering with density 1. 36893 [...] ., respectively. Both are related with the extended Coxeter group (5, 3, 5) and the so-called hyperbolic football manifold (look at Fig. 3). These facts can have important relations with fullerens in crystallography.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Corpuscles are {{flexible}} {{geometric elements}} formed by regular triangles. Corpuscle elements can be joined, thus serving as {{building blocks for}} polyhedral chains and complex threedimensional structures. Here we describe a periodic three-dimensional corpuscle grid whose negative space consists of periodically arranged octahedra. As a recurrent local structure, the grid contains the octahedron-centric corpuscle <b>ball,</b> an <b>arrangement</b> of 18 corpuscle elements surrounding an empty, octahedron-shaped space. Similarly, we construct corpuscle balls with empty cubes or icosahedra at their centres and the according rotation symmetries. Both corpuscle balls can be extended to form periodic grids, but only if slight deformations of the edge lengths are allowed. The corpuscle grids and balls contain rigid, ring-like substructures, which stabilise them against deformation...|$|R
50|$|A pivot saw has {{the highest}} degree of stiffness, because the forces are {{arranged}} in a closed loop (fig.1). If {{we assume that the}} base of such a saw is very rigid, the force will flow from the pivot of the gearbox to the ball screw feed system in a closed loop, whereby the cutting force engages in the middle, approximately, between rotation point and <b>ball</b> screw. This <b>arrangement</b> substantially reduces the lost motion and compliance in the feed system. Furthermore, the ball screw drive which forces the blade into the cut is bolted to the fixture frame which again is clamped to the billet and gives this arrangement additional rigidity.|$|R

This {{is illustrated by the}} lower part of the diagram shown in Figure 1, where one can see that balls y1, y2, y3, y4 can be drawn at each state. Even if the observer knows the composition of the urns and has just observed a sequence of three balls, e.g. y1, y2 and y3 on the conveyor belt, the observer still cannot be sure which urn (i.e., at which state) the genie has drawn the third ball from. However, the observer can work out other information, such as the likelihood that the third ball came from each of the urns.|$|R
40|$|To {{examine the}} cytologic {{features}} of infiltrating micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC). METHODS: Using the histopathology files {{of one of}} the authors (I. J. B.), we retrospectively identified 20 IMPC cases (pure, 12; partial micropapillary carcinoma differentiation, 8) with corresponding cytology. We evaluated the cases for cellularity, atypia, architecture and background. RESULTS: All cases were diagnostic of malignancy, characterized by atypical cells present predominantly in three-dimensional clusters and single cells, facilitating the diagnosis. The clusters had cell <b>ball</b> and papillarylike <b>arrangements,</b> like the morular growth pattern seen on histopathology. Apocrine cytology was present in 12 cases, focal mucin background in 5 and psamomma bodies in 2. The differential diagnosis includes primary papillary neoplasms of the breast, metastatic ovarian papillary serous carcinoma, apocrine and colloid carcinoma of the breast, and intraductal carcinoma (micropapillary type).

40|$|In {{pursuing}} the boundary lubrication tribology of aluminium, we first explore {{the change in}} chain mobility and conformational order of alkylsilane monolayer self-assembled on aluminium surface with different chain length using grazing angle FTIR spectroscopy. In tribology, a point on a surface rubbing against another surface is subjected to contact heating and cooling till next contact. We thus track conformational order as monolayers are subjected to heating and explore reversibility on cooling back. We report here the friction generated in sliding the monolayer against a 2 mm diameter steel ball in a <b>ball</b> on disc <b>arrangement</b> in the 25 – 100 mN load and 1 mm/s velocity under dry conditions. The friction at the commencement of sliding is found to correlate directly with conformational order of the molecule which is varied by changing the chain length and heat treatment temperature. We find this friction to vary linearly with full width half maxima (FWHM) which {{is an expression of}} chain mobility and packing density. The initial coefficient of friction is independent of normal load but the dynamic friction which evolves with sliding is not, although the change in dynamic coefficient of friction with normal load does relate qualitatively with the a priori conformational order of the monolayers...|$|R

The particle size distribution of the formulation {{in the form of}} suspension is a key parameter that controls the release rate. In this work, the process of wet stirred media milling (ball milling) of a poorly water-soluble substance has been investigated with two main aims: (i) to determine the parametric sensitivity of milling kinetics; and (ii) to develop scale-up methodology for process transfer from batch to flow-through <b>arrangement.</b> <b>Ball</b> milling experiments were performed in two types of ball mills, a batch mill with a 30 ml maximum working volume, and a flow-through mill with a 250 ml maximum working volume. Milling parameters were investigated in detail by methodologies of QbD to map the parametric space. Specifically, the effects of ball size, ball fill level, and rpm on the particle breakage kinetics were systematically investigated at both mills, with an additional parameter (flow-rate) {{in the case of the}} flow-through mill. The breakage rate was found to follow power-law kinetics with respect to dimensionless time, with an asymptotic d 50 particle size in the range of 200 - 300 nm. In the case of the flow-through mill, the number of theoretical passes through the mill was found to be an important scale-up parameter...|$|R
40|$|The LASER-ARC, a {{controlled}} pulsed arc plasma source combining {{advantages of the}} pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique with the high energy efficiency of a vacuum arc (VAD), was used for DLC-film preparation on different materials. The potential of the LASER-ARC is demonstrated by preparation of high-quality amorphous carbon films (DLC) up to a thickness of 500 nm in a vacuum chamber (10 (exp - 4) Pa) at low deposition temperatures (< 200 Cel). By using a laser controlled cathode spot motion of the pulsed arc evaporation of a graphite target, a drastic reduction of macropartical inclusions in the deposited, smooth and dense films is demonstrated. Only particles of about some nm {{could be found in}} the amorphous film matrix. Ar plus-bombardment is applied for substrate cleaning and is a reason for enhancing the substrate-film adhesion. An interlayer formation of about 5 nm could be detected. The deposition was carried out without using a substrate bias. The results of studied mechanical, optical and electrical properties demonstrate that the best DLC-films are obtained at low substrate temperatures. Elastic modulus (E) measured by means of ultrasonic surface waves is larger than 250 GPa. By micro-hardness measurement values between 3, 000 and 4, 000 Vickers hardness are estimated.
