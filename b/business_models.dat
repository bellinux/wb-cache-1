In this paper {{we set out to}} advance our understanding of the <b>business</b> <b>model</b> concept by addressing three areas of foundational research: <b>business</b> <b>model</b> definitions, <b>business</b> <b>model</b> elements, and <b>business</b> <b>model</b> archetypes. We define a <b>business</b> <b>model</b> as a representation of the value logic of an organization in terms of how it creates and captures customer value. This abstract and generic definition is made more specific and operational by the compositional elements that need to address the customer, value proposition, organizational architecture (firm and network level) and economics dimensions. <b>Business</b> <b>model</b> archetypes complement the definition and elements by providing a more concrete and empirical understanding of the <b>business</b> <b>model</b> concept. The main contributions of this paper are (1) explicitly including the customer value concept in the <b>business</b> <b>model</b> definition and focussing on value creation, (2) presenting four core dimensions that <b>business</b> <b>model</b> elements need to cover, (3) arguing for flexibility by adapting and extending <b>business</b> <b>model</b> elements to cater for different purposes and contexts (e. g. technology, innovation, strategy) (4) stressing a more systematic approach to <b>business</b> <b>model</b> archetypes by using <b>business</b> <b>model</b> elements for their description, and (5) suggesting to use <b>business</b> <b>model</b> archetype research for the empirical exploration and testing of <b>business</b> <b>model</b> elements and their relationships...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} <b>business</b> <b>modeling</b> defined as the managerial deliberate continuous involvement {{in the process of}} developing and adjusting a <b>business</b> <b>model</b> for their firm. This conceptualization (1) bridges the <b>business</b> <b>model</b> literature with the strategic leadership and managerial dynamic capabilities; and (2) pronounces the inseparable link between managerial agency and the <b>business</b> <b>model</b> of the firm as a unit of analysis in the micro-foundations of strategy and competitiveness. To develop this model, insights from the behavioral perspective have been used. This chapter posits that the <b>business</b> <b>model</b> of the firm follows an evolutionary path that is set and managed by executives. The current <b>business</b> <b>model</b> acts as a reference point for executives and shapes their aspiration and <b>business</b> <b>modeling</b> goals.

30|$|Drucker Peter, {{the father}} of modern management, argues that “Today’s {{competition}} between enterprises is not the competition between products, but the competition between business models” [15]. Under the high attention of all circles of society, the relevant researches about <b>business</b> <b>model</b> innovation have rapidly developed. Some scholars studied dynamic problems of the <b>business</b> <b>model</b> innovation. For example, Afuah and L. Tucci [16] thought <b>business</b> <b>model</b> is a system composed of three factors: the different component parts, the connection relations between parts, and the dynamic mechanism of system. Osterwalder [17] believed that <b>business</b> <b>model</b> innovation can be driven {{not only by the}} supply chain but also by the demand chain in the value system. Zeng and Song [18] summed up the driving forces of <b>business</b> <b>model</b> innovation, namely the marketization of new technology, market environment pressure, and the market opportunity to promote development. There are some other scholars studying the paths of <b>business</b> <b>model</b> innovation. For example, Mitchell and Coles [19] proposed three necessary conditions for <b>business</b> <b>model</b> innovation. Osterwalder et al. [20] put forward three steps of <b>business</b> <b>model</b> innovation. In addition, some scholars focus on the <b>business</b> <b>model</b> innovation method. These methods include SWOT analysis, the long tail theory, <b>business</b> <b>model</b> analysis model, value chain analysis, value stream analysis, value net analysis, activity-based management, process management and analysis tools, <b>business</b> <b>model</b> elements figure, reference method, correlation analysis method, method of key factors, value innovation, and Theory of Inventive Problem Solving [21, 22]. What is more, a few scholars have carried out the research on the trend of <b>business</b> <b>model</b> innovation. Zhao [23] studied the discipline, country, and knowledge base of <b>business</b> <b>model</b> innovation literatures and used keywords to analyze the development trend of <b>business</b> <b>model</b> innovation.

Therefore, we will visualize <b>business</b> <b>model</b> innovation in this paper to reveal the research hotspot and development trend of <b>business</b> <b>model</b> innovation in different historical periods.
