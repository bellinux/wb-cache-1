40|$|Abstract The {{frequency}} of diabetes mellitus was estimated for cats that received veterinary care from two large feline-only clinics in Brisbane. Frequency was estimated using period prevalences - {{the proportion of}} the population at risk that was affected by diabetes at any point during a specified time period. Of the 12, 576 study cats, 93 were affected with diabetes during the 5 -year study period, resulting in a 5 -year period prevalence of 7. 4 cats per 1, 000 cats. Period prevalence was significantly higher in <b>Burmese</b> <b>cats</b> (22. 4 cats per 1, 000) than domestic short and longhaired cats (7. 6 cats per 1, 000) and the mean age at first diagnosis during the study period was significantly higher amongst <b>Burmese</b> <b>cats</b> (13. 6 years) compared to domestic short and longhaired cats (10. 9 years). The risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus in <b>Burmese</b> <b>cats</b> were investigated by interviewing the owners of 33 randomly selected diabetic <b>Burmese</b> <b>cats</b> and 33 age and gender matched non-diabetic <b>Burmese</b> <b>cats</b> from South East Queensland, Australia, and examining their medical files. The most consistent effect on the probability of diabetes was the knowledge of a relative affected by diabetes, with an Odd’s ratio (OR) of 57. The prior occurrence of two or more clinical diseases in any cat was also a strong risk factor for the development of diabetes (OR= 45). Prior treatment with two or more corticosteroids was a strongly predisposing factor (OR= 13). Cats fed on a diet that contained more than 20 % of fresh food were much less likely to be diabetic (OR= 0. 12). These findings are consistent with an underlying genetic predisposition to diabetes mellitus in <b>Burmese</b> <b>cats,</b> and provide evidence that diet, chronic or recurring diseases, and corticosteroids affect the occurrence of diabetes mellitus. Pancreas tissue from <b>Burmese</b> and non-Burmese <b>cats</b> (n= 98) with and without a prior diagnosis of diabetes was examined light microscopically for any pathological features that might have an influence on islets, such as pancreatitis, increased incidence or severity of islet amyloidosis, fibrosis, neoplastic processes or decreased islet density. All diabetic as well as most non-diabetic Burmese (9 / 14, 65 %) and non-Burmese (49 / 54, 91 %) cats in this study showed some form of pancreatic pathology.

40|$|There is {{evidence}} {{for the role of}} genetic and environmental factors in feline and canine diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is {{the most common form of}} diabetes in cats. Evidence for genetic factors in feline diabetes includes the overrepresentation of <b>Burmese</b> <b>cats</b> with diabetes. Environmental risk factors in domestic or <b>Burmese</b> <b>cats</b> include advancing age, obesity, male gender, neutering, drug treatment, physical inactivity, and indoor confinement. High-carbohydrate diets increase blood glucose and insulin levels and may predispose cats to obesity and diabetes. Low-carbohydrate, high-protein diets may help prevent diabetes in cats at risk such as obese cats or lean cats with underlying low insulin sensitivity. Evidence exists for a genetic basis and altered immune response in the pathogenesis of canine diabetes. Seasonal effects on the incidence of diagnosis indicate that there are environmental influences on disease progression. At least 50 % of diabetic dogs have type 1 diabetes based on present evidence of immune destruction of P-cells. Epidemiological factors closely match those of the latent autoimmune diabetes of adults form of human type 1 diabetes. Extensive pancreatic damage, likely from chronic pancreatitis, causes similar to 28 % of canine diabetes cases. Environmental factors such as feeding of high-fat diets are potentially associated with pancreatitis and likely play a role in the development of pancreatitis in diabetic dogs. There are no published data showing that overt type 2 diabetes occurs in dogs or that obesity is a risk factor for canine diabetes. Diabetes diagnosed in a bitch during either pregnancy or diestrus is comparable to human gestational diabetes...|$|R
5000|$|Throughout {{the past}} several decades, many breeders in Thailand have bred Thong Daeng (translated as 'red gold' [...] ) cats with dark points and {{considered}} them to be Suphalaks. They were entered into cat shows in Thailand and exhibited as Suphalaks. Noted authors such as Martin Clutterbuck assumed this was the case. As a result, there was much confusion, especially among Burmese breeders who mistakenly insisted that Suphalaks were a solid sable Burmese colored cat of Thai origin. Experienced Thai breeder Kamnan Preecha Pukkabu disagreed with these breeders because the ancient poems describe a cat with the 'whole body copper' appearance and that would mean even the skin (down to the paw pads) needed to be reddish in color and not dark or black like a sable colored <b>Burmese</b> <b>cat.</b> Using one proper Suphalak male, he tried to resurrect this lost breed of cat with the ideal features, but without success. This {{has been attributed to}} two major problems, the first being that the Suphalak is so rare breeders have had great difficulty finding them. Genetically, the Suphalak is a chocolate self, expressing two recessive alleles for the brown color 'b' and the dominant 'C' allele (full color) giving the Suphalak its solid brown color. For two recessive alleles to randomly combine without human intervention i.e. in a Thai temple or on the street is rare. Secondly, the solid copper chocolate Suphalak was so scarce that few people had ever seen one and even if they did they would not know that there was anything special about it, so there was no concerted effort to preserve these cats and they never entered a breeding program until recently.|$|E
