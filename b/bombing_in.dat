5|$|Although many fires {{likewise}} burnt {{following the}} <b>bombing,</b> <b>in</b> contrast to Hiroshima where sufficient fuel density was available, no firestorm developed in Nagasaki as the damaged areas did not furnish enough fuel {{to generate the}} phenomenon. Instead, the ambient wind at the time pushed the fire spread along the valley.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, {{the base}} was secured and 150 mostly Afghan workers were {{detained}} and held incommunicado for three days. The attack {{was a major}} setback for the intelligence agency's operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It was the second largest single-day loss in the CIA's history, after the 1983 United States Embassy <b>bombing</b> <b>in</b> Beirut, Lebanon, which killed eight CIA officers. The incident suggested that al-Qaeda {{might not be as}} weakened as previously thought.|$|E
5|$|After the war, she was modernized in 1923–25 and {{subsequently}} became a training ship. In 1931, {{the ship was}} converted into an accommodation hulk. Condorcet was captured intact when the Germans occupied Vichy France in November 1942 and was used by them to house sailors of their navy (Kriegsmarine). She was badly damaged by Allied <b>bombing</b> <b>in</b> 1944, but was later raised and scrapped by 1949.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the premiere, Italy had {{experienced}} political and social unrest for several years. The start of the Holy Year in December 1899 attracted the religious to the city, but also brought threats from anarchists and other anticlericals. Police received warnings of an anarchist bombing of the theatre, and instructed Mugnone (who had survived a theatre <b>bombing</b> <b>in</b> Barcelona), that in an emergency he was to strike up the royal march. The unrest caused the premiere to be postponed by one day, to 14January.|$|E
5|$|During the war the LPO {{played in}} the capital and on continual tours of Britain, under Sargent and other conductors, {{bringing}} orchestral concerts to places where they had rarely if ever been given. Many of the players' instruments were lost when the Queen's Hall was destroyed by German <b>bombing</b> <b>in</b> May 1941; an appeal was broadcast by the BBC, the response to which was enormous, with instruments donated by the public enabling the orchestra to continue.|$|E

5|$|The offensive, {{together}} with Operation Sana, caused controversy among military analysts regarding {{the issue of}} whether NATO airstrikes or the two ground offensives contributed more towards the resolution of the Bosnian War, and to what extent ARBiH, HVO and HV advances were helped by, or conversely the VRS hampered by, NATO <b>bombing.</b> <b>In</b> 2011, five former Croatian military personnel were convicted of war crimes for the summary execution of five Bosnian Serb soldiers and an unknown civilian during the offensive.|$|E
5|$|After basic training, Carlos was {{relocated}} to San Diego, and {{assigned to a}} destroyer in the Pacific Fleet – the USS Cape Cod (AD-43). He won the California state (amateur) Middleweight Boxing Championship in 1983. He had set a goal {{to qualify for the}} Junior Olympics in boxing, but he injured his shoulder in training, and was then deployed to the Middle East subsequent to the U.S. Embassy <b>bombing</b> <b>in</b> Beirut on April 18, 1983. His ship was in the Strait of Hormuz when the US Marine barracks (along with the French paratrooper barracks) in Beirut were bombed on October 24, 1983. By 1984, the Cape Cod was rotated out of the Persian Gulf. Ashenoff returned to San Diego, and received an honorable discharge.|$|E

5|$|Agnew's {{four-year}} term as county executive saw a moderately progressive administration, {{which included the}} building of new schools, increases to teachers' salaries, reorganization of the police department, and improvements to the water and sewer systems. His anti-discrimination bill passed, {{and gave him a}} reputation as a liberal, but its impact was limited in a county where the population was 97 percent white. His relations with the increasingly militant civil rights movement were sometimes troubled. In a number of desegregation disputes involving private property, Agnew appeared to prioritize law and order, showing a particular aversion to any kind of demonstration. His reaction to the 16th Street Baptist Church <b>bombing</b> <b>in</b> Alabama, in which four children died, was to refuse to attend a memorial service at a Baltimore church, and to denounce a planned demonstration in support of the victims.|$|E
5|$|During the {{preparation}} for D-Day {{in the spring}} of 1944, the Allies launched the Transport Plan, carrying out intensive bombing of railway junctions and transport networks across northern France and Belgium. Many of these targets were in towns near densely populated civilian areas, such as La Louvière and Kortrijk in Belgium, which were bombed in March 1944. The phase of <b>bombing</b> <b>in</b> the lead up to D-Day alone resulted in 1,500 civilian casualties. Bombing of targets in Belgium steadily increased as the Allies advanced westward across France. Allied bombing during the liberation in September 1944 killed 9,750 Belgians and injured 40,000.|$|E
5|$|Each episode {{typically}} follows Bauer, {{officials in}} the U.S. government, and the conspirators behind {{the events of the}} day, often simultaneously. 24 is known for employing plot twists which may arise as antagonists adapt, objectives evolve or larger-scale operations unfold. Stories also involve interpersonal drama, delving into the private lives of the characters. As part of a recurring theme, characters are frequently confronted with ethical dilemmas. Examples of this are a <b>bombing</b> <b>in</b> Season 2, which can only be prevented by blowing Bauer's cover, and an ultimatum in Season 3, in which a terrorist agrees not to carry out an attack if a high-ranking CTU official is killed. Season 4 is also notable for a scene in which two men — one of whom possesses crucial information — are dying in a room with only one surgeon.|$|E

5|$|In the 20th century it {{developed}} into a centre for the aircraft and defence industries, which made it a target for <b>bombing</b> <b>in</b> the Second World War, {{with one of the}} largest employers being Westland Aircraft. Additionally, the Fleet Air Arm has a station RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron), the primary base of the Royal Navy's Westland Wildcat and Westland EH101 helicopters, several miles north of the town and the Ministry of Defence is a major local employer. Several other manufacturing and retail companies also have bases in the town.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} era, the UK {{produced}} derivatives {{of the design}} based on the T-1, {{as opposed to the}} original Mk. XIV. These T-2 and T-4 (Blue Devil) designs had much higher altitude, airspeed and wind-speed settings, suitable for high-altitude <b>bombing</b> <b>in</b> the jet stream. These were normally part of the Navigation and Bombing System, which combined inputs from aircraft instruments, H2S and Green Satin radars, star fixes and radio navigation systems, in a mechanical computer that directly output the latitude and longitude of the aircraft, based on automatic dead reckoning. The same outputs were also sent to the sighting head of the T-4, eliminating the need to manually set the windage and providing those values with much higher accuracy (about ±0.1mph and ±0.1 degrees).|$|E
5|$|Michael and Lori Fortier were {{considered}} accomplices for their foreknowledge {{of the planning}} of the <b>bombing.</b> <b>In</b> addition to Michael assisting McVeigh in scouting the federal building, Lori had helped McVeigh laminate a fake driver's license which was later used to rent the Ryder truck. Fortier agreed to testify against McVeigh and Nichols {{in exchange for a}} reduced sentence and immunity for his wife. He was sentenced on May 27, 1998 to twelveyears in prison and fined $75,000 for failing to warn authorities about the attack. On January 20, 2006, after serving ten {{and a half years of}} his sentence, including time already served, Fortier was released for good behavior into the Witness Protection Program and given a new identity.|$|E

5|$|Nearby is {{the former}} site of St. Mary's (Whitechapel Road) tube station. It opened in March 1884 but its close {{proximity}} to both Whitechapel and Aldgate East tube stations made it superfluous, leading to its closure in April 1938. It {{was used as an}} air raid shelter in the Second World War, but was destroyed by <b>bombing</b> <b>in</b> 1940. Opposite to the south {{is the former}} Royal London Hospital building, built in 1740. The hospital suffered significant structural damage during the Second World War, but much of the 18th and 19th centuries architecture still remains. A new building now sits adjacent to the original.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{projects}} was to build equipment to transition from the British long-wave radar to the new microwave centimeter-band radar {{made possible by the}} cavity magnetron. In working on the Microwave Early Warning system (MEW), Alvarez invented a linear dipole array antenna that not only suppressed the unwanted side lobes of the radiation field, but also could be electronically scanned without the need for mechanical scanning. This was the first microwave phased-array antenna, and Alvarez used it not only in MEW but in two additional radar systems. The antenna enabled the Eagle precision bombing radar to support precision <b>bombing</b> <b>in</b> bad weather or through clouds. It was completed rather late in the war; although a number of B-29s were equipped with Eagle and it worked well, it came too late to make much difference.|$|E
5|$|Systematic U.S. aerial {{operations}} against the Ho Chi Minh Trail had begun on 14 December 1964 with Operation Barrel Roll. With {{the onset of}} Operation Rolling Thunder, the strategic aerial bombardment of North Vietnam in April 1965, the U.S. also expanded its interdiction effort in Laos by dividing the Barrel Roll area into two sections on 3 April. The former operation would continue in northeastern Laos while Operation Steel Tiger was initiated in the southern panhandle. The American headquarters in Saigon requested, and received, authorization to control <b>bombing</b> <b>in</b> the area adjacent to South Vietnam's northern provinces in Operation Tiger Hound on 3 December 1965.|$|E
