5|$|The {{short-range}} {{committee was}} made up of members representing six computer manufacturers and three government agencies. The six computer manufacturers were Burroughs Corporation, IBM, Minneapolis-Honeywell (Honeywell Labs), RCA, Sperry Rand, and Sylvania Electric Products. The three government agencies were the US Air Force, the Navy's David Taylor Model Basin, and the National <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology). The committee was chaired by Joseph Wegstein of the US National <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Standards.</b> Work began by investigating data description, statements, existing applications and user experiences.|$|E

5|$|Roosevelt {{decided that}} the letter {{required}} action, and authorized {{the creation of the}} Advisory Committee on Uranium. The committee was chaired by Lyman James Briggs, the Director of the <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> (currently the National Institute of Standards and Technology), with Adamson and Hoover as its other members. It convened {{for the first time on}} October 21. The meeting was also attended by Fred L. Mohler from the <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Standards,</b> Richard B. Roberts of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and Szilárd, Teller and Wigner. Adamson was skeptical about the prospect of building an atomic bomb, but was willing to authorize $6,000 ($100,000 in current USD) for the purchase of uranium and graphite for Szilárd and Fermi's experiment.|$|E
5|$|The United States Department of Transportation (DOT) {{concluded}} in 1975 that DST might reduce the country's electricity usage by 1% during March and April, but the National <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> (NBS) reviewed the DOT study in 1976 {{and found no}} significant savings.|$|E
5|$|Tuve, Beams, Gunn, and Gregory Breit. The {{scientific}} subcommittee met for {{the first}} time on June 13, 1940, at the National <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Standards.</b> It reviewed the work thus far and recommended increased support for research into both nuclear chain reactions and isotope separation.|$|E

5|$|Shahaf and Doriel built {{models of}} the wall, {{concrete}} drum and IDF post, and tried to reenact the shooting. A mark on the drum from the Israeli <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> allowed them to determine its size and composition. They concluded that the shots {{may have come from}} a position behind the France2 cameraman, where Palestinian police were alleged to have been standing.|$|E
5|$|Working with Edward W. Washburn {{from the}} <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Standards,</b> Urey {{subsequently}} discovered {{the reason for}} the anomalous sample. Brickwedde's hydrogen had been separated from water by electrolysis, resulting in depleted sample. Moreover, Francis William Aston now reported that his calculated value for the atomic weight of hydrogen was wrong, thereby invalidating Birge and Menzel's original reasoning. The discovery of deuterium stood, however.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, the DPMA withdrew its {{opposition}} to the standard, citing the responsiveness of the committee to public concerns. In the same year, a National <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> study concluded that the proposed standard would present few problems. A year later, a COBOL-80 compiler was released to DEC VAX users, who noted that conversion of COBOL-74 programs posed few problems. The new EVALUATE statement and inline PERFORM were particularly well received and improved productivity, thanks to simplified control flow and debugging.|$|E

5|$|On graduation, Brode {{became an}} Associate Physicist at the National <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Standards.</b> He {{was awarded a}} Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oriel College, Oxford, in England in 1924 and 1925, and then a National Research Council Fellowship, which he used to study at the University of Göttingen in Germany in 1925 and 1926, and then at Princeton University from 1926 to 1927. On {{returning}} to the United States, he married Bernice Hedley Bidwell on September 16, 1926. They had two sons.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{of using}} atomic {{transitions}} to measure time was first suggested by Lord Kelvin in 1879, although {{it was only in}} the 1930s with the development of Magnetic resonance that there was a practical method for doing this. A prototype ammonia maser device was built in 1949 at the U.S. National <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> (NBS, now NIST). Although it was less accurate than existing quartz clocks, it served to demonstrate the concept.|$|E
5|$|The {{radio signals}} of WWV, WWVB and WWVH, {{along with the}} 4 atomic (cesium) clocks that their time signals derive from, are {{maintained}} by NIST's Time and Frequency Division, {{which is based in}} nearby Boulder, Colorado. The Time and Frequency Division is part of the NIST's Physics Laboratory, based in Gaithersburg, Maryland. NIST's predecessor, the National <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Standards,</b> previously maintained WWV {{as a part of the}} Department of Agriculture; NIST is currently part of the Department of Commerce.|$|E

5|$|After the refit was completed, São Paulo {{picked up}} {{ammunition}} in Gravesend and sailed to Cuba for firing trials. Seven {{members of the}} United States' <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> traveled with the ship from New York and observed the operations, which were conducted in the Gulf of Guacanayabo. After dropping the Americans off in Guantánamo Bay, São Paulo returned home in early 1920. August 1920 saw the dreadnought sailing to Belgium, where King Albert I and Queen Elisabeth were embarked on 1 September {{to bring them to}} Brazil. After bringing the royals home, São Paulo traveled to Portugal to bring the remains of the former emperor Pedro II and his wife, Teresa Cristina, back to Brazil.|$|E
5|$|An Advisory Committee on Uranium {{was formed}} under Lyman J. Briggs, a {{scientist}} {{and the director}} of the National <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Standards.</b> Its first meeting on October 21, 1939, was attended by Szilard, Teller, and Wigner, who persuaded the Army and Navy to provide $6,000 for Szilard to purchase supplies for experiments—in particular, more graphite. A 1940 Army intelligence report on Fermi and Szilard, prepared when the United States had not yet entered World War II, expressed reservations about both. While it contained some errors of fact about Szilard, it correctly noted his dire prediction that Germany would win the war.|$|E
5|$|Feeling unsuited to a {{managerial}} role {{in such an}} environment, he left Oak Ridge at the end {{of summer}} in 1947 and returned to Princeton University, although he maintained a consulting role with the facility for many years. In the postwar period he served on a number of government bodies, including the National <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> from 1947 to 1951, the mathematics panel of the National Research Council from 1951 to 1954, the physics panel of the National Science Foundation, and the influential General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission from 1952 to 1957 and again from 1959 to 1964. He also contributed to civil defense.|$|E

In later life, he became more philosophical, and published The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences, his best-known work outside technical mathematics and physics.|$|E
5|$|Urey and Murphy {{calculated}} from the Debye model that the heavy isotope would have a slightly higher boiling point than the light one. By carefully warming liquid hydrogen, 5 litres of liquid hydrogen could be distilled to 1 millilitre, which would be enriched in the heavy isotope by 100 to 200 times. To obtain five litres of liquid hydrogen, they traveled to the cryogenics laboratory at the National <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> in Washington, D.C., where they obtained the help of Ferdinand Brickwedde, whom Urey had known at Johns Hopkins.|$|E
5|$|Hebron Church is {{surrounded}} {{on three sides}} by a graveyard, consisting of about 700 granite, marble, slate and wooden headstones laid in semi-regular rows running northeast to southeast. The graveyard also abuts the northeastern elevation of the community building. Its interments date from about 1806 to the present; early headstones have deteriorated beyond recognition, and may be older than 1806. Slaves and other people of color are interred in a small area of the graveyard's southeastern section, with simpler markers than the cemetery's other headstones. Although its headstones are generally rectangular granite stones and large obelisks, the graveyard's earliest headstones were simple wooden boards. Several gravestones are ornately carved, including one modeled on a tree stump. The graveyard is active, with the most recent burials at the property's northern end. Dr. William Blum, Sr., an electrochemist at the National <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> who invented a chrome plating technique used in banknote printing, is interred at the cemetery.|$|E
5000|$|In 1923, Edgar Buckingham of the US National <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Standard</b> {{published}} a report expressing scepticism that jet engines would be economically competitive with prop driven aircraft {{at the low}} altitudes and airspeeds of the period: [...] "theredoes not appear to be, at present, any prospect whatever that jet propulsion of the sort here considered will ever be of practical value, even for military purposes." ...|$|R
