50|$|This {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} disputed, since the wooden box protecting a lead pipe along the longitudinal {{axis of the}} hull found on the wreck suggest {{the existence of a}} <b>bilge</b> <b>well</b> (Oleson and Stein 2007). Previous ships involved in live fish tank transport, entitled navis vivariae, did not employ a hydraulic system, and for this reason the hypothesis proves especially questionable (Boetto 124). For example, one of the wrecks found in Claudius’s harbor at the modern Fiumicino Airport in Italy was a small fish craft dating somewhere around the 2nd century CE. Archaeologists discovered a fish-well {{in the middle of the}} ship that used the hole/plump system bored in the bottom of the boat to fill the tank (Boetto 2006). Other than the Grado wreck no other evidence exists of hydraulic systems being used in the fish industry.|$|E
40|$|The {{inherent}} {{moisture in}} a coal cargo constantly migrates under the dynamic ship motion during maritime transport. The moisture often builds {{up at the}} bottom of the cargo. The accumulated water, if not removed sufficiently by the <b>bilge</b> <b>well,</b> can cause safety concerns during a voyage and difficulties during cargo unloading. The study presented in this paper aims to develop a program to investigate the moisture migration within coal cargoes in order to assess and eliminate shipping risks. The moisture migration phenomenon is initially modelled by adopting the classic infiltration theory, and considering the ship motions experienced by bulk carriers. An experimental method is developed to empirically characterise the moisture migration of a coal sample under simulated shipping dynamics. A predictive model is also developed to estimate the total moisture migration in a full size cargo by properly scaling up the experimental results. The model was validated by <b>bilge</b> <b>well</b> log collected from actual coal shipping voyages from Australia to international destinations...|$|E
5000|$|Although {{cheaper and}} easier to manufacture, assemble, and repair, the wooden pumps {{manufactured}} from then on would most likely not have been durable enough for maritime use, {{which is why we}} usually find lead pipes associated with <b>bilge</b> pumps, <b>bilge</b> <b>wells,</b> and hydraulic devices of other function about ships. The amphora shipwreck discovered at Grado in Gorizia, Italy, which dates to around 200 CE, and contained what archaeologists hypothesized to be a ‘hydraulics’ system to change the water in live fish tanks, since other evidence indicates the ship’s involvement in the processed fish trade (Beltrame and Gaddi 2005).|$|R

This mast-step timber indicates sockets {{that correspond to}} a main mast, a foremast, of a <b>bilge</b> pump <b>well,</b> and of various interior architectural characteristics. Kept at a height of 1.10m above {{the floor of the}} hold, this well was 1.5m long by 1.25m wide and consisted of four vertical supporting cross-coated plates.|$|R
40|$|Although {{catamaran}} configuration {{has been}} around for a longtime, it is only in the recent past that such hull forms have seen unprecedented growth in the high-speed ferry industry. One of the design challenges faced by naval architects is accurate prediction of the hydrodynamic characteristics of such vessels primarily in the areas of resistance, propulsion and seakeeping. Even though considerable amount of research has been carried out in this area, there remains a degree of uncertainty in the prediction of calm water resistance of catamaran hull forms. This paper attempts to present the research work carried out so far and what needs to be undertaken in future for a reasonably accurate prediction of catamaran resistance characteristics. The authors have examined the deep water wave resistance characteristics of a series of transom stern, semi-displacement slender catamaran hull forms of round <b>bilge</b> as <b>well</b> as single chine hull forms, which are of utmost importance to the high-speed ferry industry. The accuracy of the established regression equation has been seen to deviate appreciably by various sources of uncertainties. Verification of the equation with experimental database is also lacking to a certain extent. Further research is therefore needed to refine the accuracy as well as to complete the selection of crucial parameters employed. However, the results obtained have shown considerable promise, and a regression equation for predicting wave resistance of catamarans in calm water can be seen as achievable...|$|R

Because of the continual beating of the heavy seas, 12 feet (3.7 meters) of the forward end of each of her <b>bilge</b> keels as <b>well</b> as her sonar gear were replaced. With her repairs complete, she then steamed to Cold Bay, where Soviet Navy Rear Admiral Boris Dmitrievich Popov, the Soviet commanding officer at Cold Bay under Project Hula, inspected Admirable on 30 May 1945 and accepted her {{for transfer}} to the Soviet Union. On 18 June 1945, a Soviet crew reported on board to train for one month in gunnery, engineering, and minesweeping procedures.|$|R
40|$|The bloody {{red shrimp}} {{is a tiny}} {{freshwater}} crustacean in the order Mysidacea; more {{commonly referred to as}} mysids. Mysids are also sometimes called opossum shrimp because females typically carry their eggs in a pouch. While the effect this shrimp will have on the Great Lakes is unknown, based on its history of invasion across Europe, significant impacts are possible. Species Description These shrimp are very small, with males reaching only 8 - 10 mm and females reaching 11 - 16 mm. They have large, stalked eyes and eight pairs of legs. They are typically red to orange in color due to pigmented cells called chromatophores; however, coloration can be highly variable and change with varying light and temperature conditions. Some individuals lack color completely and are ivory or translucent. Without a microscope, the best way to distinguish the bloody red shrimp from other shrimp is by counting legs — it has eight pairs of legs, while most other larger shrimps and decapods have five pairs. In addition its unique swarming behavior is unlikely to be confused with anything else in the Great Lakes. With magnification, the bloody red shrimp has a distinctive flat-ended tail with two prominent spikes. Map created on 10 / 2 / 2012. ocean-going ships. However, mysids may also be used by aquarists as a high-nutrition food for aquarium fish, and although there are no records showing that the bloody red shrimp is used this way, it could represent a possible vector. Once this shrimp was introduced to the Great Lakes, subsequent spread to inter-basin areas has occurred through bait bucket transfers, hitchhiking in live <b>wells,</b> <b>bilges,</b> boat motors, trailers, and hulls, or other equipment used in the water...|$|R
