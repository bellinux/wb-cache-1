We don’t have an either/or choice to focus on near or distant security imperatives. While the Australian Government’s decision to lift defence funding will help with this, cutting aid to help offset that boost may prove counterproductive.

40|$|Accurately {{quantifying}} total {{greenhouse gas}} emissions (e. g., methane) from natural systems such as lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands requires the spatial and temporal measurement of both diffusive and ebullitive (bubbling) emissions. Ebullitive emissions exhibit high spatial and temporal variability and as such are difficult to measure. Traditional manual measurement techniques provide only limited localized assessment of methane flux, often introducing significant errors when extrapolated to the whole-of-system. This is further exacerbated when whole-of-region estimates are developed for inclusion in global greenhouse gas inventories. In this paper, we directly address these current sampling limitations by comparing two robot boat-based sampling systems with complementary sensing modalities to directly measure in real time the spatiotemporal release of methane to atmosphere across inland waterways. The first system consists of a single Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) fitted with an Optical Methane Detector with algorithms to exploit the robot's mobility and transect repeatability for the accurate detection and quantification of methane bubbles across whole-of-system. The second system consists of multiple networked ASVs capable of persistent operation and scalable to whole-of-region monitoring. Each ASV carries a novel automated chamber-based gas sampling system to allow simultaneous real-time measurement of methane across the waterway. These ASV systems provide a foundation for persistent large-scale spatiotemporal sampling allowing scientists to develop whole-of-region greenhouse gas estimates and greatly improve global inventory <b>budgets.</b> An <b>overview</b> of the single and multi-robot sampling systems is presented, including their automated methane detection and sampling methodologies for the spatiotemporal quantification of greenhouse gas release to atmosphere. Experimental results are shown demonstrating each system's ability to autonomously navigate, detect, and quantify methane release to atmosphere across an entire inland reservoir...|$|R
40|$|By 1994, Sweden had {{a budget}} deficit of 10 percent of GDP, highest among OECD countries. Its public debt had doubled in three years. Such high debt levels were {{threatening}} Sweden's economic stability {{and making it}} increasingly vulnerable to disruptive global capital market flows. The new government that took office in late 1994 put in place an aggressive fiscal consolidation program aimed at reducing the deficit significantly by 1997 and balancing the budget by 1998. > Sweden's finance minister Persson discusses his country's recent efforts to reduce its <b>budget</b> deficit. In <b>overview</b> remarks made at the bank's 1995 symposium, "Reducing Budget Deficits and Debt: Issues and Options," Persson identified three elements that are required for a fiscal consolidation to be successful. First, the program must be designed so that the burdens are shared equitably. Otherwise, public support, which is absolutely essential, will be lacking. Second, and related, the consolidation program must be comprehensive, rather than a collection of ad hoc measures, making it clear to interest groups that everyone {{will be asked to}} make sacrifices. And third, the reform process and budgeting procedures should be as transparent as possible. Only in this way can credibility be established and maintained. Budget deficits; Debt; Sweden...|$|R
