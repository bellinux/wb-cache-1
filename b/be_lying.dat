5|$|Terang Boelan is {{considered}} lost, as are most domestic productions from the era. The Filipino film historian and director Nick Deocampo noted that productions made with nitrate film– such as Terang Boelan– burned easily and were thus easily lost, but suggested that {{copies of the}} film may have survived until the 1970s. In a 1991 publication Said, Heider, and the American translator John H. McGlynn expressed hope that {{a copy of the}} film might <b>be</b> <b>lying</b> around in someone's attic or closet in Indonesia or the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Helm {{was painted}} as a {{suspicious}} figure {{by some of}} the izinDuna because all white visitors to Bulawayo met with him before seeing the king. This feeling was {{compounded by the fact that}} Helm had for some time acted as Lobengula's postmaster, and so handled all mail coming into Bulawayo. He was accused of having hidden the concession's true meaning from the king and of having knowingly sabotaged the prices being paid by traders for cattle, but neither of these charges could be proven either way. On the fourth day of the enquiry, Elliot and Rees, two missionaries based at Inyati, were asked if exclusive mining rights in other countries could be bought for similar sums, as Helm was claiming; they replied in the negative. The izinDuna concluded that either Helm or the missionaries must <b>be</b> <b>lying.</b> Elliot and Rees attempted to convince Lobengula that honest men did not necessarily always hold the same opinions, but had little success.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with the Discovery Channel, Mike Brown noted that, {{while it is not}} impossible that the Sun has a distant planetary companion, such an object would have to <b>be</b> <b>lying</b> very far from the observed regions of the Solar System to have no detectable gravitational effect on the other planets. A Mars-sized object could lie undetected at 300AU (10 times the distance of Neptune); a Jupiter-sized object at 30,000AU. To travel 1000AU in two years, an object would need to be moving at 2400km/s– faster than the galactic escape velocity. At that speed, any object would be shot out of the Solar System, and then out of the Milky Way galaxy into intergalactic space.|$|E

5|$|Jussi {{found himself}} in the unusual {{position}} of attempting to defend a client who refused to defend himself. With no evidence at his disposal to support Feletti's testimony, he was forced to rely almost entirely on his own oratory. Jussi put forward some aspects of the sequence of events that he said suggested that orders had indeed come from Rome—for example, that Feletti had sent Edgardo straight off to the capital without seeing him—and asserted that the Holy Office and the Pope were far better placed to adjudge the validity of the baptism than a secular court. He quoted at length from Angelo Padovani's account of his meeting with Anna Morisi in July 1858, then cast doubt on the grocer Lepori's claim that he did not even know how to baptise a child—Jussi produced a police report in which Lepori was described as a close friend of a Jesuit priest. Jussi proposed that Lepori and Bussolari might both <b>be</b> <b>lying</b> to protect themselves, and that Morisi's sexual impropriety did not necessarily mean her story was false. He concluded that since Feletti had been inquisitor at the time, he had merely done what that office required him to do, and no crime had been committed.|$|E
5|$|The MOD {{commissioned}} {{a series of}} multi-beam sonar surveys to image the wreck and appraise its condition. The high-resolution sonograms showed Royal Oak to <b>be</b> <b>lying</b> almost upside down with her top works forced into the seabed. The tip of the bow had been blown off by U-47s first torpedo and a gaping hole on the starboard flank {{was the result of}} the triple strike from her second successful salvo. Following several years of delays, Briggs Marine was contracted by the MoD to conduct the task of pumping off the remaining oil. Royal Oaks mid-construction conversion to fuel oil had placed her fuel tanks in unconventional positions, complicating operations. By 2006, all double bottom tanks had been cleared and the task of removing oil from the inner wing tanks with cold cutting equipment began the next year. By 2010, some 1600 tonnes of fuel oil had been removed, and the wreck was declared to be no longer actively releasing oil into Scapa Flow. Operations continue at a reduced pace to tackle the oil known to be remaining (state for 2012).|$|E
5|$|After {{not telling}} anyone about hitting Delia, Adam fears the {{investigation}} is closing in on him. He names Jack Connor's godfather and makes him promise to protect him should anything happen to him, and then proposes to Chelsea again and asks her to move to Paris with him, like they had planned during their first marriage. At the same time, Victor's private investigation on the hit-and-run driver leads him to Adam. He agrees to not turn him in {{as long as he}} can take part in Connor's life; a role he had initially refused him. Adam agrees as he and Chelsea remarry. Days before their flight to Paris, Delia's father Billy Abbott (Billy Miller) puts the pieces together and realizes Adam is the one who killed his daughter. He holds him at gunpoint and demands he drive them to places where milestones in Delia's life occurred. While driving, Adam attempts to grab the gun as a shot is fired and the car drives off a ravine. One of them staggers away from the crash and collapses, revealed to be Billy. Nick and Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) find the overturned vehicle as it catches fire and explodes. Adam's body is thrown from the vehicle, is not recovered and he is presumed dead, devastating Chelsea just as news that Adam killed Delia breaks. However, Adam's bloody hand is later shown to be moving, alluding that he survived. Soon after, he is shown to <b>be</b> <b>lying</b> in a bed, being held captive by an unknown captor. Later Victor informs Chelsea that his investigators have found Adam's remains, but elsewhere Adam is seen paying off Victor's investigator, confirming that Adam has faked his death.|$|E

5|$|Grant Morrison later {{chose to}} heavily reimagine Kathy Kane in 2011 for his Batman Incorporated series. It is {{established}} that Kathy Kane was born Katherine Webb, {{and that she}} had been an aspiring independent film director prior to marrying a millionaire named Nathan Kane, the son of Roderick and Elizabeth Kane and brother of Martha (Kane) Wayne, Bruce Wayne's mother. Nathan and Kathy were madly in love with one another, and it was Nathan who ended up buying Kathy her circus as a birthday present. After Nathan's untimely death, Kathy was approached by a young man known only as Agent-33, who recruited her into a covert spy organization called Spyral. As part of her first assignment, Kathy was tasked with tracking down Batman and discovering his true identity. Donning a female variation of Batman's costume in order to gain his attention, she embarked on a career as a costumed crime-fighter while attempting to get close to Batman. Her plan succeeded but the two fell in love with one another, despite Kathy legally being Wayne's aunt. As a result, she refused to reveal his identity to her superiors at Spyral. Later, Kathy was confronted by the head of Spyral, a Nazi supervillain named Dr. Dedalus (Otto Netz) who claimed to be her real father and threatened to expose her to Batman unless she continued her mission. Heartbroken, she broke off her relationship with Bruce in order to save him from Dedalus' plan. In the present, Batman and the South American vigilante El Gaucho are told by the villainess Scorpiana that El Gaucho was responsible for Kathy's murder, as he had originally been Agent-33 prior to becoming a superhero. Batman tells Gaucho that Scorpiana must <b>be</b> <b>lying</b> since Kathy had been killed by the League of Assassins, but Gaucho claims that there is some truth in her accusations, and that Batman wouldn't understand. In the follow-up one-shot Batman Incorporated: Leviathan Strikes, students of an assassin training facility masquerading as St. Hadrian's Finishing School For Girls in England are shown wearing variations of Kathy's Batwoman costume, with the original masks replaced by skulls. Later, these women are shown to be agents of Spyral, dedicated to hunting down Talia al Ghul, whose organisation Leviathan is waging war with Batman. Kathy reappears alive in the concluding issue of Batman Incorporated, in which she shoots Talia al Ghul dead in the Batcave. Identifying herself as St Hadrian's headmistress and requesting Batman not to go looking for her, she thanks Batman for leading Talia into her trap and reports to Spyral headquarters that one more international criminal has been killed.|$|E
25|$|To bluff is {{to pretend}} to have a {{capability}} or intention one does not actually possess. Bluffing {{is an act of}} deception that is rarely seen as immoral when it takes place {{in the context of a}} game, such as poker, where this kind of deception is consented to in advance by the players. For instance, a gambler who deceives other players into thinking he has different cards to those he really holds, or an athlete who hints he will move left and then dodges right is not considered to <b>be</b> <b>lying</b> (also known as a feint or juke). In these situations, deception is acceptable and is commonly expected as a tactic.|$|E
25|$|The chacmool is a {{distinctive}} form of Mesoamerican sculpture representing a reclining figure with its head facing 90 {{degrees from the}} front, leaning on its elbows and supporting a bowl or a disk upon its chest.

The {{tensions}} between the Mitchells and the Hubbards increase when Phil snatches Vincent's infant daughter, Pearl Fox-Hubbard. Ronnie helps negotiate what she thinks is a truce between the two men, but Fatboy informs her that Vincent is still planning to kill Phil. She organises for men to take Vincent, lock him in the boot {{of his car and}} have it crushed. She is distracted when Jack returns to spend Christmas with Amy. When Ronnie sees Vincent and he has no knowledge of the car, she realises the men put someone else in the car boot, but finds it has already been taken to be crushed. After Ronnie tells Vincent what she had planned, he goes to the scrapyard and finds Fatboy is dead. He decides not to tell Ronnie this, and lies that the boot was empty. Ronnie then rekindles her relationship with Jack. She learns from Mick of Dean's attempted rape of Roxy, and Roxy plans to move to Portugal. Glenda returns and tells Ronnie to stop Roxy from leaving but they are unsuccessful when Roxy says Ronnie has controlled her and she needs to be alone. Ronnie re-evaluates her life and, believing that this is the reason why she and Jack are no longer together, asks Jack to leave with Amy as she too needs to be alone. Glenda tells Ronnie that Eric could not have killed Henry and that Vincent's mother, Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas), must <b>be</b> <b>lying</b> to him. Ronnie tells Claudette to remain civil towards the Mitchells or she will tell Vincent what she knows.|$|E
