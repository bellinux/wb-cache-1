25|$|The gap {{branch is}} rarely relied on <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> little left to default {{to the federal}} {{government}} after taking into account the enumerated provincial power over property and civil rights under section 92(13) which applies to any transaction, person or activity that is found within the province.

500|$|The film {{relied on}} subtext, {{requiring}} the actors to [...] "read between the lines" [...] {{for a number}} of their scenes. Most of the sentiments are understated, and Burshtein avoided having any of the characters break down or openly become angry when pressured. Yaron described a scene between Yochay and Rivka as her favorite, saying, [...] "I think it's <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> much pain there; it touches you the most when people feel something and try to hide it and you see it." ...|$|E
500|$|Aadisht Khanna from Mint praised Tripathi's {{portrayal}} of Shiva in the book, complimenting {{the fact that}} he was able to successfully deliver the humane side of his characters, and their emotions and motivations. He also pointed out that Tripathi's experimentation with Indian Scriptures, has been successful in transforming an otherwise mundane genre, [...] "long overdue in popular literature, especially by an Indian author". However, he was disappointed in the weak dialogue and the grammatical errors scattered throughout the book, especially the inclusion of [...] "glaringly out-of-place world" [...] words, thus having too many anachronism in the book. Rito Paul from Daily News and Analysis shared Khanna's opinion, while saying that the book [...] "is impressive in its conception. But it is executed poorly. [...] "We're thrust into the narrative, mid-action, exactly from where the first book ended. And the breathless pace of the action hardly ever lets up... There are more twists and turns than in a Gordian knot, and at least two revelations of the 'Luke-I-am-your-father' variety... And it really rankles, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> much scope for flair, adventure and wonder in the world Tripathi has imagined... The Secrets is not a bad book. The plot holds your attention and the story races along, but the writing veers between the pedestrian and the ridiculous. Tripathi is an excellent story-teller. But he is a poor writer." ...|$|E

2500|$|It is <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> much {{territory}} left to {{be claimed}} that skilled players would not end {{the game in the}} previous position. The game might continue with White playing 1 in the next diagram. If the game ended in this new position, the marked intersections would become White's territory, since they would no longer be connected to an empty intersection adjacent to a black stone.|$|E
2500|$|Recording {{folk songs}} {{works like a}} candid cameraman. I hold the mike, use my hand for shading volume. It's a big problem in Spain <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> much {{emotional}} excitement, noise all around. Empathy is most important in field work. It's necessary to put your hand on the artist while he sings. They have to react to you. Even if they're mad at you, it's better than nothing. When Columbia Records producer George Avakian gave jazz arranger Gil Evans {{a copy of the}} Spanish World Library LP, Miles Davis and Evans were [...] "struck by the beauty of pieces such as the 'Saeta', recorded in Seville, and a panpiper's tune ('Alborada de Vigo') from Galicia, and worked them into the 1960 album, Sketches of Spain." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> {{little room}} at the home where they live, Bramble Bellflower (...) decides {{that he and his}} family should move. He does not {{announce}} the plan until later, when the seven members come {{over to the other side}} of the hill and look at their new property. They do not know that Bramble has actually bought and remodelled the house, which is called The Berries. It will be eight days before the family settles in their new spot. But Periwinkle, one of Bramble's five children, is deeply affected by the change of address; he is afraid he will miss his neighbour, Pimpernelle, and his old home, in the process. He finds his new room, which he will share with brother Dandelion, too large for his liking.|$|E

2500|$|The court {{noted that}} the plaintiffs were {{challenging}} not [...] "the grants but the conferences" [...] which are [...] "concerned in part with instructing the attendants on how to apply for government grants for their religious organizations". They held that the government's position that only the grants could be challenged, not the conferences [...] "would be artificial <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> much that executive officials could do to promote religion in ways forbidden by the establishment clause (which despite its wording applies to executive as well as congressional action, American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois v. City of St. Charles, supra, 794 F.2d at 270) without making outright grants to religious organizations. For the government to operate a mosque or other place of worship would not involve a grant unless a contractor was involved." ...|$|E
2500|$|When adopted {{children}} grow into young adults, many {{worry about their}} health. For many {{adopted children}}, their adoptive families are given little to none of their medical history, especially if the adoption was international. This can be {{due to lack of}} information {{on the part of the}} biological family, type of adoption or circumstance in which the adoptee was found (for example being left at an orphanage in a foreign country). Simple trips to the doctor or dentist, for something as small as a check up, can bring about great worry <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> many unknowns to ones health when the person is adopted. Anxiety over lack of medical history may become worse for those who are seeking to get married and start a family. If one of the parents is unaware of medical history, having a child becomes much more difficult. The risks of being unable to conceive, or the child being born with certain health issues are higher because parental medical history is unknown.|$|E

60|$|Of Pacuvius, {{who succeeded}} him, {{there is little}} to be said, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> little {{remaining}} of him; only that he is taken to be the nephew of Ennius, his sister's son; that in probability he was instructed by his uncle in his way of satire, which we are told he has copied; but what advances he made, we know not.|$|E

60|$|Shanghai and Tientsin {{are white}} men's cities; the {{first sight of}} Shanghai makes one wonder what {{is the use of}} travelling, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> little change from what one is used to. Treaty Ports, each of which is a centre of European influence, exist {{practically}} all over China, not only on the sea coast. Hankow, a very important Treaty Port, is almost exactly in the centre of China. North and South China are divided by the Yangtze; East and West China are divided by the route from Peking to Canton. These two dividing lines meet at Hankow, which has long been an important strategical point in Chinese history. From Peking to Hankow there is a railway, formerly Franco-Belgian, now owned by the Chinese Government. From Wuchang, opposite Hankow on the southern bank of the river, there is to be a railway to Canton, but at present it only runs half-way, to Changsha, also a Treaty Port. The completion of the railway, together with improved docks, will greatly increase the importance of Canton and diminish that of Hong-Kong.|$|E
6000|$|... 'In the {{personal}} conduct of my Hero and Heroine, {{there is one}} circumstance which was intended to startle the reader from the trance of ordinary life. It was my object {{to break through the}} crust of those outworn opinions on which established institutions depend. I have appealed therefore to the most universal of all feelings, and have endeavoured to strengthen the moral sense, by forbidding it to waste its energies in seeking to avoid actions which are only crimes of convention. It is <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> great a multitude of artificial vices that there are so few real virtues. Those feelings alone which are benevolent or malevolent, are essentially good or bad. The circumstance of which I speak was introduced, however, merely to accustom men to that charity and toleration which the exhibition of a practice widely differing from their own has a tendency to promote. (The sentiments connected with and characteristic of this circumstance have no personal reference to the Writer.--[Shelley's Note.]) Nothing indeed can be more mischievous than many actions, innocent in themselves, which might bring down upon individuals the bigoted contempt and rage of the multitude.' ...|$|E
60|$|Sunday.--It {{occurs to}} me that one reason why there is no news in my letters is <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> little in my life. I always tell you of my concerts: I was at another {{yesterday}} afternoon: a recital of Hallé and Norman Neruda. I went in the evening to the pantomime with the Mackintoshes--cousins of mine. Their little boy, aged four, was there for the first time. To see him with his eyes fixed and open like saucers, and never varying his expression save in so far as he might sometimes open his mouth a little wider, was worth the money. He laughed only once--when the giant's dwarf fed his master as though he were a child. Coming home, he was much interested as to who made the fairies, and wanted to know if they were like berries. I should like to know how much this question was due to the idea of their coming up from under the stage, and how much to a vague idea of rhyme. When he was told that they were not like berries, he then asked if they had not been flowers before they were fairies. It was a good deal in the vein of Herbert Spencer's primitive man all this.|$|E
5000|$|DED {{complexes}} {{have been}} shown to function at crucial steps controlling life and death cell processes. This knowledge is particularly useful in therapy <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> many pathologies related with an abnormal control of the cell life.|$|R
