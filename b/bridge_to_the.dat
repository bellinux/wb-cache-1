5|$|The Michigan Avenue Bridge has a north–south orientation, {{spanning}} the main stem of the Chicago River between the Near North Side and Loop community areas of Chicago. Its northern portal {{lies at the}} foot of the Magnificent Mile, between the Wrigley Building and Tribune Tower. Its southern portal is at the intersection of Michigan Avenue and Wacker Drive, overlooked by the London Guarantee Building and 333 North Michigan. The neighboring bridges are Columbus Drive <b>Bridge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east and Wabash Avenue <b>Bridge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} salvo from the 15cm {{batteries}} in Drøbak, the steering {{from the bridge}} was disabled. Blücher had just passed Drøbakgrunnen (Drøbak shallows) and was in a turn to port. The commander got her back on track by using the side shafts, but she lost speed. Normally the rudder is controlled electrically from the <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> motors forward of the Handsteuerraum (hand steering room) deep under the armored deck, forward of the rudder. In an emergency it can be switched within seconds to manual steering, but orders from the <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rudder may be delayed. At 04:34 Norwegian land-based torpedo batteries scored two hits on the ship. The targeting device in the torpedo battery was very primitive. The speed of the torpedo was known and set, but {{the speed of the}} target had to be adjusted by dead reckoning (guessing).|$|E

5|$|Although {{opposite}} {{each other}} across the River Thames, Fulham on the north bank and Wandsworth on the south bank were historically isolated from each other; the nearest crossing points were at Putney <b>Bridge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west and Battersea <b>Bridge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east, both over a mile from Wandsworth. The fast flowing but narrow River Wandle at Wandsworth was well-situated for driving watermills, leading to the rapid spread of industry in the area during the 19th century. Nearby Battersea Railway Bridge opened in 1863, but as the local population grew and London's built-up area began to encroach during the 19th century, pressure from local residents and businesses for a road bridge to be built increased.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{believed}} to have evolved from mainland-based ancestors, and may share ancestors with C. melanosterna and C. palearis, as it is phylogenetically closer to these two than it is to C. similis.

5|$|A {{number of}} new {{crossings}} have been proposed as relief for the Dartford Crossing. The proposed Thames Gateway <b>Bridge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west was given planning permission by Transport for London (TfL) in December 2004, but was cancelled in November 2008 when Boris Johnson became Mayor of London. Johnson subsequently proposed the Gallions Reach Ferry, a ferry crossing in the same location, as an alternative. The Lower Thames Crossing is a proposed tunnel to the east between Shorne, Kent and South Ockendon, Essex. Thurrock Council suggest that this crossing will be essential for managing congestion. A public consultation on the scheme ended in March 2016, with the route announced in April 2017, though Highways England {{do not expect to}} start construction before 2026.|$|E

5|$|Beginning on February 25, 2008, I-75 closed {{completely}} to traffic {{in both directions}} from Rosa Parks Boulevard (exit49) to Clark Street (exit47) in Detroit. This facilitated the complete rebuilding of the road {{as part of the}} Ambassador Gateway Project to better connect I-75 and I-96 to the Ambassador Bridge. Through traffic on I-75 was rerouted along I-94 to I-275 and local detours were posted. The freeway reopened to traffic in June 2009, five months ahead of schedule. The overall project to realign and connect the <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> freeways was mired in lawsuits between MDOT and the private company that owns the bridge. The company's owner was jailed for contempt of court during court proceedings in early 2012. MDOT was later ordered to assume responsibility for construction, and the department completed the project on September 21, 2012.|$|E
5|$|By 1821, Stratford {{was served}} {{by a number of}} wharves, some located on the Lea and others on the Channelsea River or other branches. In {{addition}} to wharves for general goods, some specifically handled timber, chalk, stone, coal, or wheat. Several of the factories and mills had private wharves. By this date, a dock had been built near Bow <b>Bridge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south of the High Street. It was about , and was connected to the river by its own channel. It was initially called Stratford Dock, later becoming Meggs Dock and was probably constructed by the Middlesex and Essex Turnpike Trust. Half of it had been filled in by 1896, and the rest by 1920.|$|E
5|$|In February 1926 William Matheson {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} with D. P. Davis (a land developer, not related to Waters Davis) to develop and re-sell the northern half of Key Biscayne, including all {{of what is now}} Crandon Park and about half the present Village of Key Biscayne. Davis had experience with turning submerged or partially submerged land into prime real estate, having created the Davis Islands in Tampa and Davis Shores near St. Augustine. Later in 1926, the City of Coral Gables incorporated with Key Biscayne, which was included in its boundaries. There were dreams of a <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island, making Key Biscayne the seaside resort for Coral Gables, as Miami Beach had become for Miami.|$|E

5|$|On November 16, 2011, the {{production}} received a fine (between $343–$3,440) from the Bulgarian {{environmental protection agency}} for unlawfully removing shrubs and small trees from the entrance of Devetashka Cave. Although permits had been obtained allowing sets {{to be built in}} the area (including a <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cave), environmentalists complained that filming could damage the cave (home to about 40 endangered species). To avoid further problems, the producers agreed not to film explosions, car chases and fires near the cave.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the bridge's construction, Pleasure Island was {{accessible}} only by ferry. In 1907, the Pleasure Beach Ferry Company was given the rights to build a movable toll bridge. A series of trestles were built across the tidal flats with a swing span across the dredged channel. The swing span was constructed in 1927, but in the Great Depression the Beach Ferry Company transferred control of the <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city of Bridgeport. The tolls were removed and the bridge continued to be used after Pleasure Beach's closing in 1968, until the 1996 fire. Repairs {{were made to the}} bridge in 1988 with money from the state. In 1994, the need to replace the bridge resulted in a state and federal promise of $20 million, but this was rejected by the Connecticut Department of Transportation in 1995.|$|E
5|$|State Route 47 (SR 47) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California, {{connecting}} Terminal Island to the mainland in the Los Angeles area. From its south end at I-110 in San Pedro, it heads east across the Vincent Thomas <b>Bridge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island {{and the end of}} state maintenance. The state highway begins again at the junction with I-710 on Terminal Island, crossing the Schuyler Heim Bridge north to the mainland and the second terminus, where SR 103 begins. Signage continues along a locally maintained route, mainly Alameda Street, to the Gardena Freeway (SR 91) in Compton, and an unconstructed alignment follows the same corridor to the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10) near downtown Los Angeles.|$|E

5|$|Szent István {{differed}} from her half-sisters mainly in her machinery. She only had two shafts and two turbines, unlike the four shaft {{arrangement of the}} other ships of her class. External differences included a platform built around the fore funnel which extended from the <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> after funnel and on which several searchlights were installed. A further distinguishing feature was the modified ventilator trunk {{in front of the}} mainmast. She was the only ship of her class not to be fitted with torpedo nets.|$|E
5|$|The A354 road is {{the only}} land access to Portland, via Ferry Bridge, {{connecting}} to Weymouth and to the wider road network at the A35 trunk road in Dorchester. It runs from Easton, splitting into a northbound section through Chiswell and a southbound section through Fortuneswell, then along Chesil Beach and across a <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mainland in Wyke Regis. Formerly a branch line railway, connecting to the South West Main Line near Weymouth railway station, also crossed to the island. The corridor is now a cycle path connecting Fortuneswell with Weymouth and a wider network of traffic-free cycle paths.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{continued}} {{during the}} morning; however, by 12:00 the North Koreans finally withdrew, abandoning the <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Australians. Meanwhile, Coad put two companies from the Argylls across the Taeryong River on tanks at the Pakchon ford, and they met only slight opposition. The Middlesex then passed through them, moving south-west onto {{the main road}} in front of 3 RAR where they knocked out a North Korean tank which was blocking their advance. By nightfall they had linked up with the Australians, consolidating their positions and securing a safe crossing {{for the remainder of the}} brigade, including the wheeled vehicles which followed that evening. North Korean patrols attempted to harass the British and Australian outposts; however, despite their perimeter being shelled it proved to be a relatively quiet night for the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade.|$|E

5|$|The {{contract}} {{for construction of}} the pontoon bridge was awarded in August 1991 to a consortium, Arbeidsfellesskapet Salhus Bru, which consisted of Norwegian Contractors, Aker Entreprenør, Veidekke and Kværner Eureka. The components were built in Moss and Fredrikstad and then shipped to Lonevågen, a branch of Osterfjorden which was suitable to connect the parts. There were problems welding the high-strength low-alloy steel, {{which resulted in the}} work being halted for several days before an agreement was reached between the contractor and the Public Roads Administration. On 26 January 1994, the steel frame which would be used to fasten the pontoon <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cable-stayed bridge, came adrift during transport in Skagerrak, and was severely damaged, causing a delay in the project. As the bridge had the longest laterally unsupported span in the world, the construction was watched by many international delegations.|$|E
5|$|The first {{discussion}} of a bridge in a public forum was in 1954, when Anton P. Torsvik proposed a <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> major and municipal engineer of Fjell. Torsvik lived in Oslo and had worked with public relations for various other bridge projects. The issue was discussed in the municipal councils of Fjell and Sund, but they both concluded {{that there were more}} pressing needs on the islands' road network, so {{they did not want to}} prioritize a bridge. National Road 555 was completed in 1957, and the following years various road projects were completed.|$|E
5|$|Two bascule bridges—the Paintersville Bridge and Isleton Bridge—replaced {{the free}} ferries in 1923, and {{are of a}} type {{patented}} by Joseph B.

Local businessmen Aven Hanford and Oscar Klatt replaced the toll ferry with the tolled Antioch Bridge in mid-1926, almost a year before they opened the larger Carquinez <b>Bridge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west. The counties of Contra Costa and Sacramento organized a joint highway district in November 1925 to fund an improvement of the northern approach from Rio Vista; the concrete highway was completed in July 1927, creating a fully paved continuous route between Sacramento and the bay.|$|E
