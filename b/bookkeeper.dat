40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the habitus of <b>bookkeepers</b> and professional accountants in Vietnam, a communist country, by experimenting with Bourdieu’s practice theory. Such theory seeks to examine {{the ways in which}} accounting individuals (or classes) inhabit a position, invoking practical knowledge which enables them to function in particular positions. Such functions are to be associated with habitus – durable, transposable dispositions which are both constitutive of and constituted by the context or field in which they operate Design/Methodology/Approach: This is a qualitative research and the naturalistic inquiry approach was selected for this paper. There were 14 <b>bookkeepers</b> and 15 professional accountants interviewed with the purpose of adding to a growing but still sparse literature on the work practices of <b>bookkeepers</b> who make up the majority of accounting practitioners in Vietnam. Findings All <b>bookkeepers</b> attach their identity to their daily routine work and highlight the importance of keeping updated on the new rules issued by the government. They, together with some professional accountants, have also found their identity formed through connections with government officials. Some locally qualified accountants have deviated their career or identity from the traditional pathway by the embarked on obtaining professional qualifications of ACCA or CPA (Australia). Originality/value: This paper offers insights of how the <b>bookkeepers</b> and professional accountants see themselves and what the gap is between <b>bookkeepers</b> and professional accountants, in {{the context in which the}} Communist rule-based country is getting involved more deeply in the globalisational process...|$|R

5|$|Gröning {{worked as}} a <b>bookkeeper</b> for a year until 1942, when the SS ordered that desk jobs would be {{reserved}} for injured veterans, and that fit members in administrative roles were {{to be subjected to}} more challenging duties. Gröning and about 22 of his colleagues travelled to Berlin where they reported to one of the SS economic offices. They were then given a lecture by several high-ranking officers who reminded them of the oath of loyalty they took, which they could prove by doing a difficult task. The task was top secret – Gröning and his comrades had to sign a declaration that they would not disclose it to family or friends, or people not in their unit. Once this had concluded, they were split into smaller groups and taken to various Berlin stations where they boarded a train in the direction of Katowice with orders to report to the commandant of Auschwitz, a place Gröning had not heard of before.|$|E
