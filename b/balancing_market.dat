50|$|One of {{the main}} {{difficulties}} in power systems is {{that the amount of}} active power consumed plus losses should always equal the active power produced. If more power would be produced than consumed the frequency would rise and vice versa. Even small deviations from the nominal frequency value would damage synchronous machines and other appliances. Making sure the frequency is constant is usually the task of a transmission system operator. In some countries (for example in the European Union) this is achieved through a <b>balancing</b> <b>market</b> using ancillary services.|$|E
50|$|Programme Imbalance {{is settled}} by the System Operator, with {{different}} tariffs for negative Programme Imbalance and positive Programme Imbalance. A positive Programme Imbalance indicates more energy actually produced than forecast. by wind energy the realised wind production {{is bigger than}} the forecast wind production. And vice versa, {{in the case of}} a negative Programme Imbalance by wind energy. Note that the costs for positive and negative imbalances may be asymmetric, depending on the <b>balancing</b> <b>market</b> mechanism. In general, wind power producers are penalized by such market system since a great part of their production may be subject to penalties.|$|E

TSOs use these markets for the acquisition of the resources needed for the balance between generation and demand on real-time (minute-to-minute operation). <b>Balancing</b> <b>markets,</b> since their beginning, were conceived to cope with real-time operation issues such as forecast errors on generation/demand and unplanned power outages due to a fault on generation units or transmission facility. Today, <b>balancing</b> <b>markets</b> are facing new challenges. One {{of them is the}} incorporation of a considerable amount of intermittent renewable generation on the generation mix, which could impose an increase on the volumes traded on <b>balancing</b> <b>markets</b> in order to ensure the correct performance of the system. Another issue is the tendency of displacing national energy markets by regional markets within which multi-area Day-Ahead trading is managed. This article presents the current designs of several European <b>balancing</b> <b>markets,</b> i. e. The Belgian, Swiss, German, Danish, Spanish, French, Italian and Dutch <b>balancing</b> <b>markets.</b> Since control reserves vary from one system to another, this article first presents a classification of the control reserves used within the surveyed systems. From the classification we proceed to the comparison of the assessment, remuneration (methods and structure), and cost recovery for secondary and tertiary reserves applied by each TSO. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

50|$|An {{assessment}} of the lost revenues is needed if some power plants, such as wind turbines, have absolute priority (must-run plants). A dispatching authority will in this case order the other plants to decrease power. In some countries plant operators are entitled to receive compensation for such interventions. In a competitive electricity market the situation can be handled by a balancing mechanism, in which any imbalance from the schedule (typically a day-ahead schedule) is penalized, either using the price from a <b>balancing</b> <b>market</b> or a calculated price. Thus, since UK spark spreads were {{in the range of}} 4-9 £/MWh - on average £6.5/MWh, or 0.65 p/kWh, we can assess the likely cost of relegating existing power stations to a standby role for a large penetration of renewables as being around 0.65 p/kWh.|$|E

50|$|When {{electricity}} sectors were regulated, utility monopolies used short-term load forecasts {{to ensure}} the reliability of supply and long-term demand forecasts {{as the basis for}} planning and investing in new capacity. However, since the early 1990s, the process of deregulation and the introduction of competitive electricity markets have been reshaping the landscape of the traditionally monopolistic and government-controlled power sectors. In many countries worldwide, electricity is now traded under market rules using spot and derivative contracts. At the corporate level, electricity load and price forecasts have become a fundamental input to energy companies’ decision making mechanisms. The costs of over- or undercontracting and then selling or buying power in the <b>balancing</b> <b>market</b> are typically so high that they can lead to huge financial losses and bankruptcy in the extreme case. In this respect electric utilities are the most vulnerable, since they generally cannot pass their costs on to the retail customers.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{safeguard}} power system security, Transmission System Operators {{are obliged to}} continuously maintain the balance between demand and supply of electrical power. To this end, they procure so-called balancing services. This thesis studies the design and integration of <b>markets</b> for <b>balancing</b> services in Europe. Contrary to previous academic work in this field, it approaches <b>balancing</b> <b>markets</b> from a broad perspective  i. e. as comprising the procurement of balancing services and the settlement of imbalances  and {{takes into account the}} interrelationship between both components. The first part of this thesis focuses on the current  predominantly national  organisation of <b>balancing</b> <b>markets</b> in Europe. It identifies and analyses main design parameters and puts forward an appropriate market design based thereon. This design proposal ensures both market-based balancing service procurement prices and cost-reflective imbalance prices. The second part of this thesis considers the implementation of cross-border <b>balancing</b> <b>markets.</b> It first discusses different implementation proposals and qualitatively assesses the benefits and implementation costs they each may entail using a self-developed framework. It further proposes methodologies to quantitatively assess the welfare gains of implementing cross-border procurement as well as the welfare distorting impact of implementing cross-border settlement in case of structurally differing imbalance settlement methods. Both methodologies are applied to the Belgian-Dutch border. nrpages: 159 status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} {{illustrate}} this electricity market mechanism, let us consider the Dutch electricity market. Market participants, referred to as Program Responsible Parties (PRPs), submit their price-quantity bids before 11 am for the delivery period covering the following day from midnight to midnight. The Program Time Unit (PTU) on the <b>balancing</b> <b>market</b> is of 15 minutes. Balancing of the 15-minute averaged power is required from all electrical producers and consumers connected to the grid, who for this purpose may be organised in sub-sets. Since these sub-sets {{are referred to as}} Programmes, balancing on the 15-minute scale is referred to as Programme Balance. Programme Balance now is maintained by using the production schedules issued the day before delivery and measurement reports (distributed the day after delivery). When the measured power is not equal to the scheduled power, the Programme Imbalance is the difference between the realised sum of production and consumption and the forecast sum of production and consumption. If only production from wind energy is taken into account, Programme Imbalance reduces to realised wind production minus forecast wind production. The programme imbalance is the wind production forecast error.|$|E
40|$|In today’s {{unbundled}} electricity markets, the <b>balancing</b> <b>market</b> is {{an intricate}} institutional arrangement that {{makes sure that}} the balance between electricity supply and demand is maintained. In {{the light of the}} development of a single electricity market in Europe, harmonization and integration of currently national balancing markets have received an increasing attention from governments, system operators, and regulators. This dissertation provides a systematic overview of the possibilities and effects of <b>balancing</b> <b>market</b> design and internationalization in a European market context. A <b>balancing</b> <b>market</b> design framework is presented, including a reference model, a design space, and a set of performance criteria. A multi-criteria analysis is carried out to estimate the effects of individual <b>balancing</b> <b>market</b> design variables.

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the benefits of}} electricity locational marginal pricing (LMP) that arise from better coordination of day-ahead commitment decisions and real-time <b>balancing</b> <b>markets</b> in adjacent power markets when there is significant uncertainty in demand and wind forecasts. To do so, we formulate a series of stochastic models for committing and then dispatching electric generators subject to transmission limits. In the unit commitment stage, the models optimise day-ahead generation schedules under either the full set of network constraints or a simplified net transfer capacity (NTC) constraint, where the latter represents the present approach for limiting forward electricity trade in Europe. A subsequent redispatch model then creates feasible real-time schedules. Benefits of LMP arise from decreases in expected start-up and variable generation costs resulting from consistent consideration of the full set of network constraints both day-ahead and in real time. Meanwhile, coordinating adjacent <b>balancing</b> <b>markets</b> provides benefits because intermarket flows can be adjusted in real-time in response to changing conditions. To quantify these benefits, we analyse a stylised four-node network, examining the effects of varying system characteristics on {{the magnitude of the}} locational-based unit commitment benefits and the benefits of intermarket balancing. We conclude that both categories of benefits are situation dependent, such that small parameter changes can lead to large changes in expected benefits. Although both can amount to a significant percentage of operating costs, we find that the benefits of coordinating <b>balancing</b> <b>markets</b> generally exceed unit commitment benefits...|$|R

40|$|The {{share of}} {{microgeneration}} (power generation {{at the level}} of households and small businesses) in the Dutch electricity system continues to grow. Over time, this development may pose a threat to the reliability and efficiency of the Dutch electricity <b>balancing</b> <b>market.</b> We investigated possible changes to the design of the Dutch <b>balancing</b> <b>market</b> that can maintain or even improve upon its current operational performance level. The first step of the research was an analysis of the existing Dutch <b>balancing</b> <b>market.</b> It consists of three main instruments: programme responsibility, the single buyer market for regulating and reserve power (RRP), and imbalance settlement. The <b>balancing</b> <b>market</b> currently functions satisfactorily. Subsequently, the effects of large-scale development of microgeneration in the Netherlands were evaluated with a qualitative scenario analysis. Four microgeneration scenarios and two methods for allocating the household electricity consumption and generation were considered. The four scenarios concerned large-scale penetration of PV, heat-led micro CHP, electricity-led micro CHP operated by the household consumer, and electricity-led micro CHP operated by the supply company. The last scenario was found to have the strongest positive net effect. Finally, six design options were identified for improving the Dutch <b>balancing</b> <b>market</b> design in case the share of microgeneration would increase substantially. Of these six options, adjusting the profile methodology and the regulation of smart meters are no-regret options that can be implemented immediately. The attractiveness of the other options depends upon the microgeneration portfolio that emerges, the manageability of large metering data flows, {{and the nature of the}} technical effects of large-scale microgeneration penetration. <b>Balancing</b> <b>market</b> Microgeneration Market design...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{integration}} of balancing markets, i. e. market-based balance management arrangements, {{is regarded as}} an important {{next step in the}} development towards an Internal Electricity Market for Europe, and is expected to largely reduce the costs of real-time balancing by enhancing competition in balancing service markets. However, there is still a large knowledge gap on the possibilities and effects of <b>balancing</b> <b>market</b> integration. This paper contributes to filling up that gap by means of a qualitative assessment of the main alternative market arrangements for cross-border balancing. We evaluate the impact of seven main cross-border balancing arrangements {{on the basis of a}} set of ten high-level performance criteria. The analysis shows that although the net impact of the arrangements of ACE netting and a common merit order list can be expected to be positive, there are major uncertainties in impact related to the dependency on detailed <b>balancing</b> <b>market</b> design choices and power system and market conditions. The uncertainties and dependencies regarding the impact of <b>balancing</b> <b>market</b> integration call for a detailed analysis in each individual integration case.

Thus, absence of any "free unbounded lunches relative to the total capital" opportunities lead to the most dramatic failure of diversity in the market: one company takes over all other until the end of time. In order to prove this, we introduce the notion of perfectly <b>balanced</b> <b>markets,</b> which is an equilibrium state in which the relative capitalization of each company is a martingale under the physical probability. Then, the weaker notion of <b>balanced</b> <b>markets</b> is discussed where the martingale property of the relative capitalizations holds only approximately, we show how these concepts relate to growth-optimality and efficiency of the market, as well as how we can infer a shadow interest rate that is implied in the economy {{in the absence of a}} bank. ...|$|R
