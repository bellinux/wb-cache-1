5000|$|In January 2007, Dov {{licensed}} {{the rights}} to <b>bicifadine</b> to XTL Biopharmaceuticals after <b>bicifadine</b> failed in a Phase III clinical trial for chronic lower back pain. XTL ran a PhaseIIb clinical trial for pain caused by diabetic neuropathy, which failed in 2008; [...] XTL terminated the agreement in 2010. [...] In 2010 Dov was acquired by Euthymics Bioscience which intended to continue development of other candidates from Dov's portfolio.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bicifadine</b> (DOV-220,075) is a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake {{inhibitor}} (SNDRI) {{discovered at}} American Cyanamid as an analgesic drug candidate, and licensed to DOV Pharmaceutical in 1998 after American Cyanamid {{was acquired by}} Wyeth.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bicifadine</b> has a non-opioid, non-NSAID {{mechanism}} {{for the treatment of}} pain, which should have less abuse potential than opioid drugs and less propensity to cause gastric ulcers than NSAID drugs. While the drug is purported to be a serotonin (SERT) and noradrenaline transporter (NET) inhibitor, it also has effects at the dopamine transporter (DAT), effectively making it a broad-spectrum monoamine transporter inhibitor or [...] "triple reuptake inhibitor." ...|$|E
40|$|The abuse {{liability}} of the analgesic <b>bicifadine</b> {{was investigated in}} animal models used to predict the abuse potential of psychostimulants in humans. <b>Bicifadine,</b> cocaine, d-amphetamine, bupropion, and desipramine were evaluated {{for the production of}} cocaine-like discriminative stimulus effects in rats. Cocaine, d-amphetamine, and bupropion dose-dependently and fully substituted for cocaine. <b>Bicifadine</b> and desipramine produced a maximum mean cocaine-lever selection of 80 and 69 %, respectively, but doses yielding peak substitution strongly suppressed response rates. Microdialysis studies in normal waking rats indicated that d-amphetamine increased dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens and striatum to a much greater degree than <b>bicifadine,</b> but <b>bicifadine</b> increased 5 -hydroxytryptamine levels in the nucleus accumbens and striatum more than d-amphetamine. <b>Bicifadine</b> was also tested for intravenous self-administration in rhesus monkeys experienced with cocaine administration. Reinforcing effects of <b>bicifadine</b> were observed in only two of four subjects, whereas cocaine, d-amphetamine, and bupropion served as reinforcers in all four monkeys. When evaluated under a progressive ratio procedure, no dose of <b>bicifadine</b> maintained responding to the extent of cocaine, d-amphetamine, or bupropion. The discriminative stimulus effects associated with <b>bicifadine</b> were similar, but not identical, to those of psychostimulants. Although <b>bicifadine</b> maintained self-administration behavior in some subjects, its reinforcing efficacy was very low relative to cocaine, d-amphetamine, and bupropion. These results are consistent with the microdialysis findings of lower dopamine levels and higher 5 -hydroxytryptamine levels after administration of <b>bicifadine</b> relative to d-amphetamine. Overall, the current findings support a low abuse potential of <b>bicifadine,</b> more resembling that of antidepressants than psychostimulants...|$|E
40|$|The crystal {{structures}} of o-toluidinium chloride (1), o-toluidinium bromide (2) and two polymorphs of <b>bicifadine</b> hydrochloride (3) have been determined. The polymorphs of 3 {{differ in their}} molecular conformation and in their mode of packing. Crystallisation studies and quantum mechanical calculations show that the more readily crystallisable polymorph grows from the thermodynamically most stable conformer. On heating, conversion to the second polymorph takes place just below the melting point. The {{crystal structures}} of 1, 2 and the first polymorph of 3 have been successfully predicted using a procedure that is suitable for simple ionic organics...|$|E
