5|$|Indium {{has many}} semiconductor-related applications. Some indium compounds, such as indium {{antimonide}} and indium phosphide, are semiconductors with useful properties: one precursor is usually trimethylindium (TMI), {{which is also}} used as the semiconductor dopant in II–VI compound semiconductors. InAs and InSb are used for low-temperature transistors and InP for high-temperature transistors. The compound semiconductors InGaN and InGaP are used in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes. Indium is used in photovoltaics as the semiconductor copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), also called CIGS solar cells, a type of second-generation thin-film solar cell. Indium is used in PNP <b>bipolar</b> <b>junction</b> <b>transistors</b> with germanium: when soldered at low temperature, indium does not stress the germanium.|$|E

From August 1956 CADET was offering a regular computing service, during which it often executed continuous computing runs of 80 hours or more. Problems with the reliability of early batches of point contact and alloyed junction transistors meant that the machine's mean time between failures was about 90minutes, but this improved once the more reliable <b>bipolar</b> <b>junction</b> <b>transistors</b> became available.|$|E

2500|$|Avalanche {{transistor}} circuits are intrinsically {{large signal}} circuits, so small signal models, {{when applied to}} such circuits, can only give a qualitative description. To obtain more accurate information about the behavior of time dependent voltages and currents in such circuits {{it is necessary to}} use numerical analysis. The [...] "classical" [...] approach, detailed in the paper [...] which relies upon the book , consists in considering the circuits as a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and solve it by a numerical method implemented by a general purpose numerical simulation software: results obtained in this way are fairly accurate and simple to obtain. However, this methods rely on the use of analytical transistor models best suited for the analysis of the breakdown region: those models are not necessarily suited to describe the device working in all possible regions. A more modern approach is to use the common analog circuit simulator SPICE together with an advanced transistor model supporting avalanche breakdown simulations, which the basic SPICE transistor model does not. Examples of such models are described in the paper [...] and in the paper : the latter is a description of the Mextram model, currently used by some semiconductor industries to characterize their <b>bipolar</b> <b>junction</b> <b>transistors.</b>|$|E
2500|$|When the {{collector}} current {{rises above the}} data sheet limit [...] a new breakdown mechanism become important: the second breakdown. This phenomenon is caused by excessive heating of some points (hot spots) in the base-emitter region of the bipolar junction transistor, which give rise to an exponentially increasing current through these points: this exponential rise of current in turn gives rise to even more overheating, originating a positive thermal feedback mechanism. While analyzing the [...] static characteristic, {{the presence of this}} phenomenon is seen as a sharp collector voltage drop and a corresponding almost vertical rise of {{the collector}} current. At the present, {{it is not possible to}} produce a transistor without hot spots and thus without second breakdown, since their presence is related to the technology of refinement of silicon. During this process, very small but finite quantities of metals remain in localized portions of the wafer: these particles of metals became deep centers of recombination, i.e. centers where current exists in a preferred way. While this phenomenon is destructive for <b>Bipolar</b> <b>junction</b> <b>transistors</b> working in the usual way, it can be used to push-up further the current and voltage limits of a device working in avalanche mode by limiting its time duration: also, the switching speed of the device is not negatively affected. A clear description of avalanche transistor circuits working in second breakdown regime together with some examples can be found in the paper [...]|$|E
