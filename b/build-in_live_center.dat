50|$|Baker University {{has three}} {{residence}} halls and two apartment buildings for students living on campus. Gessner Hall provides suite style living arrangements for 152 male residents. It {{was built in}} 1966, and the building was renovated in 2012. Irwin Hall provides suite style living arrangements for 150 female residents. The newest residence hall is the New <b>Living</b> <b>Center,</b> which houses 190 students in 48 rooms. The New <b>Living</b> <b>Center</b> is the largest on campus, with three stories and six wings totaling 52,000 square feet.|$|R
50|$|A {{revolving}} center, {{also known}} as a <b>live</b> <b>center</b> in some countries, is constructed so that the 60° center runs in its own bearings and is used at the non-driven or tailstock end of a machine. It allows higher turning speeds without the need for separate lubrication, and also greater clamping pressures. CNC lathes use this type of center almost exclusively and they may be used for general machining operations as well. Spring-loaded centers are designed to compensate for center variations, without damage to the work piece or center tip. This assures the operator of uniform constant tension while machining. Some <b>live</b> <b>centers</b> also have interchangeable shafts. This is valuable when situations require a design other than a 60° male tip. A <b>live</b> <b>center,</b> which may be hard or soft, is a plain center placed in the revolving mandrel - it moves therefore is live.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "Resident" [...] {{could mean}} an {{individual}} or family depending on the program design. This Resident is self-admitted or via family/friends, referral (i.e. another Transitional Center), or court order. Most programs have admission requirements and an [...] "entry" [...] intake instrument. For example an Alcohol and/or Drug <b>Living</b> <b>Center</b> may administer a [...] "standards" [...] tool known as the A.S.I. (Addiction Severity Index) that measures and presents domestic, addiction, and social understandings and personal [...] "life" [...] issues. The majority of <b>Living</b> <b>Centers</b> use their admissions intake information received from the client to aide them {{in the design of}} [...] "personal" [...] or [...] "individual" [...] Care Plan of that particular client or family. The Resident agrees to abide by the Living Standards of the <b>Living</b> <b>Center,</b> which is verified through a binding legal rental agreement or standard of acceptance agreement between the Center and the individual.|$|R

40|$|Research {{supports}} {{a positive relationship}} between living-learning communities and students’ academic accomplishments and personal development. Successful communities reflect the institution’s mission, and the institution’s purpose and goals are adapted for the student population the communities serve. Living learning communities provide a sense of belonging, which is critical for students to persist in college to realize their full personal and academic potential. With limited research concerning living-learning communities and honors students, {{it is difficult to determine}} which characteristics of living-learning communities positively affect honors students. This document examines the relationship between the living-learning community (Niemeyer <b>Living</b> <b>Center)</b> and honors students at Grand Valley State University. The findings indicate honors students who participate in the Niemeyer <b>Living</b> <b>Center</b> perceive themselves to be more socially connected to their community and the campus, and are more involved in activities outside the classroom, than honors students living off-campus. The difference is less significant between honors students living in the Niemeyer <b>Living</b> <b>Center</b> and honors students living elsewhere on-campus...|$|R

25|$|The only {{options for}} living on North Campus for upperclassmen are the program houses and co-op houses: Risley Residential College, Just About Music, the Ecology House, Holland International <b>Living</b> <b>Center,</b> the Multicultural <b>Living</b> Learning Unit, the Latino <b>Living</b> <b>Center,</b> , and Ujamaa. In {{an attempt to}} create a sense of {{community}} and an atmosphere of education outside the classroom and continue Andrew Dickson White's vision, a $250million reconstruction of West Campus created residential colleges there for undergraduates. The idea of building a house system can be attributed in part to the success of Risley Residential College, the oldest continually operating residential college at Cornell.|$|R
5000|$|Finally, {{the intent}} of the Transitional <b>Living</b> <b>Center</b> is to provide a place where the person can re-establish their self-worth, re-discover their place in society, and find {{compassion}} and love through Spiritual discovery and a genuine understanding of personal relationships. The bulk of the Centers try to maintain a [...] "home" [...] atmosphere where a family type relationship is developed between the Resident's, Staff, and Volunteers. The Transitional <b>Living</b> <b>Centers</b> of today go far above and beyond the term [...] "Half-Way" [...] in proving that half-way is not good enough and [...] "complete" [...] is the goal to strive for.|$|R
