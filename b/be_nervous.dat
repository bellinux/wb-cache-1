25|$|Chrysopelea ornata is diurnal and arboreal. The snake's gliding ability, {{while not}} as {{impressive}} {{as that of the}} paradise flying snake (C. paradisi), still makes it capable of moving from tree to tree with relative ease. These snakes are excellent climbers, being able move across even the smallest of branches and even straight up trees with few branches by using the edges of rough bark. They are frequently seen moving up a coconut palm, or up vertical rock faces in graceful curves, gripping the somewhat uneven surfaces with their scales. They tend to <b>be</b> <b>nervous,</b> fast-moving snakes, and will attempt to flee if disturbed, but will not generally hesitate to bite if handled. They are mildly venomous, but the venom is not considered to be dangerous to humans. It is intended to assist in subduing fast moving, arboreal prey.|$|E
500|$|Appeal to Reason {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. It received {{a score of}} 65 out of 100 on Metacritic's average of ten professional reviews. In his review giving the album an 82% rating, Chris Fallon of AbsolutePunk.net said, [...] "Appeal to Reason is essentially focused on one big thing: intelligence. There is no fluff here -- the band {{has put together a}} fast, smart and generally focused piece of work here." [...] Rolling Stone magazine tells of the band's further emergence into the mainstream with Appeal to Reason, [...] "Rise Against may <b>be</b> <b>nervous</b> about leaving the underground behind, but with sharp songs like these, they're ready {{for the rest of the}} world." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{association}} with a proven and popular children's brand focusing on potentially sensitive subjects enabled the TV series to deflect any serious controversy regarding the same subjects, {{as they had}} demonstrably already been presented to children without any ill effects. Senior writer Steve Punt {{said that there were}} in fact very few complaints regarding the initial series' content, adding that [...] "everyone was very relieved". The producers did consider some topics intrinsically unsuited for an irreverent comic treatment, as for instance the Holocaust or the harsher details of slavery, and avoided them accordingly. Norris has described her personal criteria for age suitability as whether she would <b>be</b> <b>nervous</b> watching it with a ten-year-old. While BBC executives in large part were willing to concede the requirements of reflecting historical realities, some topics, notably suicide, needed careful handling to avoid potentially negative impact on younger viewers. The show sometimes acknowledged particularly emotive subject matter (the World War I Christmas truce, for example) by following up the sketch not with a joke, but a more sombre elaboration of the less comedic details.|$|E

500|$|Rise Against's fifth studio album Appeal to Reason was {{released}} on October 4 in Australia, October 6 across Europe, and October 7 in the United States. The album sold 64,700 copies in its first week and peaked at numberthree on the U.S. Billboard 200, making it Rise Against's highest-charting album to date. Appeal to Reason was met with generally positive reviews. However, critics did not rate it as highly as The Sufferer & the Witness, mostly blaming the movement toward the mainstream and away from faster hardcore punk. Giving the album a C+ rating, Marc Weingarten of Entertainment Weekly said the album is filled with [...] "protest anthems that lean closer to the burnished angst of such bands as New Found Glory and Fall Out Boy than the genuine outrage of brainy Green Day" [...] and songs that are [...] "peppy but pretty empty, power-chord downers with little bark or bite." [...] Kyle Anderson of Rolling Stone stated that the songs on Appeal to Reason [...] "are driven by an ever-sharpening pop sensibility." [...] He also said that [...] "Rise Against may <b>be</b> <b>nervous</b> about leaving the underground behind, but with sharp songs like these, they're ready {{for the rest of}} the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout all this, Gladstone was {{supported}} {{not only by}} the popular and charismatic Rosebery but also by an array of well-dressed women including Lady Rosebery and Gladstone's daughter Mary. These fashionable people– the celebrities of their day (newspapers at the time gave many column inches each day to the doings of the upper classes)– were as much a crowd-puller as the political speakers, and Rosebery's planning used that to full effect. One meeting was so packed that many were fainting: 70,000 people applied for tickets in a hall capable of holding 6,500. Lady Rosebery reported, [...] "I had never heard Archie (Lord Rosebery) speak in public politically before, but after the first minute I felt I could never <b>be</b> <b>nervous</b> at his making a speech the audience show him great affection." [...] However it was not just Gladstone and Rosebery the huge crowds had come to see, but also the dutifully supporting and smiling families. Lady Rosebery went on to describe how [...] "They (the crowds) patted me on the back till my shoulders were sensitive." [...] Thus in Rosebery's first serious involvement in politics, Disraeli was defeated and the newly elected MP for Midlothian became Prime Minister for the second time (the caretaker liberal leader Lord Hartington retired in favour of Gladstone). It was also obvious that Lady Rosebery was a very evident and valuable political electioneering asset. As the Marquess of Crewe put it [...] "she had cut her spurs." ...|$|E
500|$|Stanton wanted WALL-E to be {{a box and}} EVE to be like an egg. WALL-E's {{eyes were}} {{inspired}} {{by a pair of}} binoculars Stanton was given when watching the Oakland Athletics play against the Boston Red Sox. He [...] "missed the entire inning" [...] because he was distracted by them. The director was reminded of Buster Keaton and decided the robot would not need a nose or mouth. Stanton added a zoom lens to make WALL-E more sympathetic. Ralph Eggleston noted this feature gave the animators more to work with and gave the robot a childlike quality. Pixar's studies of trash compactors during their visits to recycling stations inspired his body. His tank treads were inspired by a wheelchair someone had developed that used treads instead of wheels. The animators wanted him to have elbows, but realized this was unrealistic because he is only designed to pull garbage into his body. His arms also looked flimsy when they did a test of him waving. Animation director Angus MacLane suggested they attach his arms to a track on the sides of his body to move them around, based on the inkjet printers his father designed. This arm design contributed to creating the character's posture, so if they wanted him to <b>be</b> <b>nervous,</b> they would lower them. Stanton was unaware of the similarities between WALL-E and Johnny 5 from Short Circuit until others pointed it out to him.|$|E

[...] Duchesne now halted his men {{to allow them to}} regroup, eat an early lunch and {{replenish}} their ammunition. [...] The French buried their dead and the gunboat Éclair, which had finally linked up with the column, took the wounded on board and ferried them up to Tuyen Quang. [...] An hour later the march resumed. [...] At 3.30 p.m. the column entered the Yu Oc defile, whose exit towards Tuyen Quang was blocked by two fortlets and by a series of trenches. [...] Abattis nearly 300 metres deep covered the path. [...] A force coming from Tuyen Quang could not have crossed this pass. [...] Around 7 p.m. the advance guard approached the citadel.

2500|$|Baker {{then ran}} to the {{entrance}} of the Texas School Book Depository, entered the building with his gun drawn, and led by building superintendent Roy Truly, {{made his way to the}} far northwest corner of the first floor. From there, Baker and Truly started yelling for someone to send an elevator down from a higher floor. When there was no response, the two men began climbing the stairs, with Truly in the lead. Approximately 90 seconds after the shots rang out, Baker stepped out onto the second floor and a movement towards the lunchroom vestibule across from the stairs caught his attention. Baker confronted Oswald at gunpoint. He let Oswald pass after Truly identified him as an employee. According to Baker, Oswald did not appear to <b>be</b> <b>nervous</b> or out of breath. Truly said that Oswald appeared [...] "startled" [...] when Baker aimed his gun at him. According to the Warren Commission, Oswald was next seen by a secretary as he crossed through the second-floor business office carrying a soda bottle. He left the Texas School Book Depository through its front door at approximately 12:33p.m..|$|E
2500|$|The {{report also}} noted that {{although}} the front-end and rear-end crews {{should have been in}} regular communication, that {{did not appear to be}} the case in this accident. [...] As the freight train reached Hargwen, Hudson radioed back to Smith that the signals were green, a communication that was heard by a following freight. [...] As it ran towards Dalehurst there was no evidence of further communication. [...] As the conductor is in charge of the train, had Smith felt that the train was out of control or there were serious problems, he should have pulled the brake cord in the caboose to stop the train. [...] However, Smith, who appeared to <b>be</b> <b>nervous</b> while testifying, said that he did not feel that the freight was ever out of control, misjudging its speed. [...] He also testified that he attempted to radio Hudson on two radios and several channels, but neither seemed to be working, despite the fact that immediately after the crash Smith was able to contact the dispatcher by radio. [...] Despite Smith's testimony, he apparently decided not to stop the train.|$|E

2500|$|Ranjitsinhji {{returned}} to England in mid-May and immediately resumed the captaincy of Sussex. However, {{a succession of}} low scores and uncertain performances suggested that he was neither mentally nor physically fit for cricket and Simon Wilde writes that his failure to secure support in India and the continued pressure of threatened bankruptcy placed him in a difficult situation. The Australian cricket team was touring England once more and Ranjitsinhji, having played against the team for the MCC, was selected for the first Test. However, he seemed to <b>be</b> <b>nervous</b> and struggled to concentrate, running out his captain, Archie MacLaren before he was out himself for 13. Wisden noted: [...] "a misunderstanding, for which Ranjitsinhji considered himself somewhat unjustly blamed, led to MacLaren being run out, and then Ranjitsinhji himself quite upset by what had happened, was clean bowled". Although he scored 135 for Sussex shortly afterwards, in the second Test he was out without scoring. Over the next few weeks, Ranjitsinhji made good starts to several innings but lost his wicket to uncharacteristic lapses and leg-break bowlers continued to trouble him. He missed several matches, far {{more than he had}} missed in other seasons. However, in favourable batting circumstances he played two large innings in this period, hitting 230 against Essex and 234 against Surrey. An injury in the former game caused Ranjitsinhji to miss the third Test, lost by England, although his lack of confidence may have played a part in his decision. He returned for the fourth Test which England narrowly lost. However, he faced serious distractions from his parlous financial situation as one of his creditors presented him with a demand for payment shortly before the game. Ranjitsinhji claimed [...] after the match, falsely, that Pratap Singh intended to pay the debt but needed approval from the India Office, but it is likely that Ranjitsinhji anticipated another petition in bankruptcy going before a court and that this affected his performance in the Test. Showing signs of nerves, and never looking comfortable while batting, Ranjitsinhji scored 2 runs in the first innings and 4 in the second. In the latter innings, when England had a relatively small target to chase for victory, he looked to have lost all confidence and could have been dismissed several times; the Australian players thought he played more poorly than they had ever seen. His lack of belief may also have contributed to the defeat, as Fred Tate notoriously dropped an important catch fielding, according to Simon Wilde, in a position which [...] Ranjitsinhji was more likely to fill in normal circumstances. Wilde writes: [...] " [...] failed to play their part, notably Ranji, whose abject performance was in marked contrast to his former days of splendour. The real reason for his poor performance has remained the knowledge of only a very few. At the time, a polite veil was drawn over his failure, but he was never to play for England again." [...] In 15 Test matches, all against Australia, he scored 989 runs at an average of 44.96.|$|E
