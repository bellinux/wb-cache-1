2500|$|In 1956 DuPont {{introduced}} polyether polyols, specifically poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol, and BASF and Dow Chemical {{started selling}} polyalkylene glycols in 1957. Polyether polyols were cheaper, easier to handle and more water-resistant than polyester polyols, and became more popular. Union Carbide and Mobay, a U.S. Monsanto/Bayer joint venture, also began making polyurethane chemicals. In 1960 more than 45,000 {{metric tons of}} flexible polyurethane foams were produced. The availability of chlorofluoroalkane blowing agents, inexpensive polyether polyols, and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) allowed [...] polyurethane rigid foams {{to be used as}} high-performance insulation materials. In 1967, urethane-modified polyisocyanurate rigid foams were introduced, offering even better thermal stability and flammability resistance. During the 1960s, automotive interior safety components, such as instrument and door panels, were produced by <b>back-filling</b> thermoplastic skins with semi-rigid foam.|$|E

But because of protests from city dwellers and revised {{policies}} of city planners, Gouda did not continue <b>back-filling</b> moats and city-canals, now considered historically valuable. In 1944, the railway station was damaged during an Allied bombardment, killing 8 and wounding 10 persons. This bombardment was intended to destroy the railroad connecting The Hague and Rotterdam to Utrecht.|$|E

40|$|Settlements, {{differential}} {{settlements in}} particular, {{are one of}} the most important issues in the design and construction of structures on a back-filled open-cut mine. Several factors might contribute to settlements in back-filled areas including the self-weight of the <b>back-fill</b> material, flooding or groundwater rise, and further loading. Self-weight induced settlement of <b>back-fill</b> material is a major component of both the immediate and long term settlements, and is considered in the paper. Realistic settlement estimates are obtained by non-linear numerical modelling. The time-settlement behaviour of the <b>back-fill</b> is also investigated by applying a time dimension to the model...|$|R
40|$|Open-cut {{coal mine}} <b>back-fill</b> usually {{undergoes}} significant settlement due to inundation by surface water infiltration and groundwater rise. The rate {{and magnitude of}} inundation settlement is difficult to predict and quantify due to {{the large number of}} contributing factors. Consequently, none of the available settlement models and theories has been able to successfully describe the inundation settlement occurring in back-filled open-cut coal mines. A combination of laboratory and numerical simulation of settlement is a valuable means of estimating the inundation settlement of <b>back-fill.</b> The settlements predicted by this simulation are in a good agreement with previous observations of inundation settlement in open-cut coal mine <b>back-fill...</b>|$|R

50|$|Croesor Quarry {{is notable}} amongst Welsh slate {{quarries}} for being almost entirely underground, with no significant surface workings. It was rare in its {{extensive use of}} forced air ventilation instead of the more common natural ventilation used in most slate mines. It also generated relatively small external waste tips compared with the volume of finished slates produced; this was largely achieved by <b>back-filling</b> underground chambers with waste once they were exhausted.|$|E
5000|$|A three-option {{proposal}} was drawn up soon after that, although {{the project would}} be delayed until after the new fiscal year beginning July 1, 1963. The first option, costing $277,490, consisted of entrenching the fire and <b>back-filling</b> the trench with incombustible material. The second, costing $151,714, offered a smaller trench in an incomplete circle, followed by {{the completion of the}} circle with a flush barrier. The third plan was a [...] "total and concerted flushing project" [...] larger than the second project's flushing and costing $82,300.|$|E
50|$|Shredded {{tires are}} now being used in landfills, {{replacing}} other construction materials, for a lightweight <b>back-fill</b> in gas venting systems, leachate collection systems, and operational liners. Shredded tire material may {{also be used to}} cap, close, or daily cover landfill sites. Scrap tires as a <b>back-fill</b> and cover material are also more cost-effective, since tires can be shredded on-site instead of hauling in other fill materials.|$|R

40|$|A <b>back-fill</b> Sn flow is {{reported}} against the current-stressing at Sn/Cu micro-joint interface. Upon current-stressing, as the cathode Cu 6 Sn 5 compound is dissolving into adjacent Sn solder matrix, Cu in the dissolving Cu 6 Sn 5 compound region would be highly-depleted, which would likely transform to highly-vacant Sn grains. Thus, a large Sn concentration gradient would be established between the highly-vacant Sn grains (dissolving Cu 6 Sn 5 compound) and the Sn solder matrix, which causes Sn atoms diffusing into the newly-formed Sn grains. The {{driving force of}} the <b>back-fill</b> Sn flow was evaluated and, indeed, it can overcome the electromigration force...|$|R
50|$|Spreite {{differ from}} menisca, which are flat to {{slightly}} curved, <b>back-filling</b> structures {{found in some}} tubular burrows. Menisca are formed when the organism packs sediment, and sometimes fecal material as well, in behind itself as it moves through the burrow. Because spreite and menisci represent different behaviors, the distinction between spreiten and meniscate burrows is an important criterion for the identification of certain ichnotaxa. For example, generally parallel-sided, elongate, horizontal burrows with menisci are typically assigned to the Muensteria ichnospecies, whereas similar burrows with spreite will generally be assigned to the Rhizocorallium ichnogenus.|$|E
5000|$|The {{expected}} {{air raids}} did not eventuate, {{and with the}} tunnels unused, {{by the end of}} 1943 the timber supports were beginning to fail. By February 1945, without the money to upgrade or convert the tunnels to other use, plans were made to fill them in. The tunnels were filled in with 8.8 million unfired clay blocks made by Crum Brick and Tile in New Lynn. It took 15 men a total of 12 months to complete the <b>back-filling</b> process and the entrances were sealed and buried by 18 April 1946.|$|E
50|$|The marine {{works on}} the Waterfront District {{includes}} a submerged reef as first defense line extending 100 m seawards along {{the full extent of}} the Corniche - 80 reinforced concrete caissons, each 17.5 m wide, 27.75 m long and 10.5 m high, as second defense line. The superstructure provides two-level promenades over 1.3 km. <b>Back-filling</b> behind them provides a stabilizing bond and a third promenade, 5.5 m above sea level. On September 16, 2012, the New Waterfront District was the site of a huge mass held by the pope. The mass was the culmination of Pope Benedict XVI's three-day visit to Lebanon.

The body had been laid in a wooden coffin, with two small gold foil crosses, one over each eye. One opinion was that he had been laid in the coffin by Christians, and that the coffin had been then buried by pagans.

50|$|War was commonplace; many archaeologists {{believe the}} people of Etowah battled for hegemony over the Alabama river basin with those of Moundville, a Mississippian site in present-day Alabama. The town was {{protected}} by a sophisticated semicircular fortification system. An outer band formed by nut tree orchards prevented enemy armies from shooting masses of flaming arrows into the town. A 9 ft to 10 ft deep moat blocked direct contact by the enemy with the palisaded walls. It also functioned as a drainage system during major floods, common for centuries, from this period and into the 20th century. Workers formed the palisade by setting upright 12 ft high logs into a ditch approximately 12 in on center and then <b>back-filling</b> around the timbers to form a levee. Guard towers for archers were spaced approximately 80 ft apart.|$|E

5000|$|Contexts {{are single}} events or actions that leave discrete, {{detectable}} traces in the archaeological sequence or stratigraphy. They can be deposits (such as the <b>back-fill</b> of a ditch), structures (such as walls), or [...] "zero thickness surfaciques", {{better known as}} [...] "cuts". Cuts represent actions that remove other solid contexts such as fills, deposits, and walls. An example would be a ditch [...] "cut" [...] through earlier deposits. Stratigraphic relationships are the relationships created between contexts in time, representing the chronological order they were created. One example would be a ditch and the <b>back-fill</b> of said ditch. The temporal relationship of [...] "the fill" [...] context to the ditch [...] "cut" [...] context is such that [...] "the fill" [...] occurred later in the sequence; you have to dig a ditch before you can <b>back-fill</b> it. A relationship that is later in the sequence is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "higher" [...] in the sequence, and a relationship that is earlier, [...] "lower", though this does not refer necessarily to the physical location of the context.

5000|$|Aside from geo-political tensions, {{concerns}} {{have been raised}} about the environmental impact on fragile reef ecosystems through the destruction of habitat, pollution and interruption of migration routes. These new islands are built on reefs previously 1 m {{below the level of}} the sea. For <b>back-filling</b> these seven artificial islands, a total area of 13.5 km2, to the height of few meters, China had to destroy surrounding reefs and pump [...] of sand and corals, resulting in significant and irreversible damage to the environment. Frank Muller-Karger, professor of biological oceanography at the University of South Florida, said sediment “can wash back into the sea, forming plumes that can smother marine life and could be laced with heavy metals, oil and other chemicals from the ships and shore facilities being built.” Such plumes threaten the biologically diverse reefs throughout the Spratlys, which Dr. Muller-Karger said may have trouble surviving in sediment-laden water.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{government}} jurisdictions in the United States recommend {{or require}} the use of a reinforced fence, sometimes called a [...] "super" [...] silt fence or an enhanced silt fence, on some construction sites. This design uses filter fabric reinforced by a wire mesh or chain link fence. The metal backing gives the fence increased strength to resist the weight of soil and water which may be trapped by the fence in a large drainage area, and discourages construction site operators from driving vehicles over the fence. However, an improper installation of a super silt fence can create an inadvertent sediment basin when the filter fabric becomes clogged. This typically causes flooding and increased downstream pollution. Most super silt fence specifications are out-dated, requiring the trenching installation method, which {{has been shown to be}} highly susceptible to [...] "washing out" [...] under the fabric due to improper <b>back-filling</b> and inadequate compaction.|$|E

50|$|The tomb is {{excavated}} {{into the}} side of a hill. It is formed of a semi-subterranean room of circular plan, with a corbel arch covering that is ogival in section. With an interior height of 13.5m and a diameter of 14.5m, it was the tallest and widest dome in the world for over a thousand years until construction of the Temple of Hermes in Baiae and the Pantheon in Rome. Great care was taken in the positioning of the enormous stones, to guarantee the vault's stability over time in bearing the force of compression from its own weight. This gave a perfectly smoothed internal surface, onto which could be placed gold, silver and bronze decoration. The room was constructed by digging vertically into the hillside, like a well, and then walling and roofing the space with stone from the floor level of the chamber, and finally <b>back-filling</b> the earth above. Tiers of ashlar masonry were laid in rings so that each successive tier projected slightly farther inward, until only a small opening is left at the top.|$|E
50|$|It is {{the wide}} range of colors and the ability to make a tube that can last for years if not decades without replacement, that makes this an art. Since these tubes require so much custom labor, they would have very little {{economic}} viability if they did not have such a long lifetime when well processed. The intensity of neon light produced increases slowly as the tube diameter grows smaller, that is, the intensity varies inversely with the square root of the interior diameter of the tubing, and the resistance of the tube increases as the tubing diameter decreases accordingly, because tube ionization is greatest {{at the center of the}} tube, and the ions migrate to and are recaptured and neutralized at the tube walls. The greatest cause of neon tube failure is the gradual absorption of neon gas by high voltage ion implantation into the interior glass walls of the tubes which depletes the gas, and eventually causes the tube resistance to rise to a level that it can no longer light at the rated voltage, but this may take well over 50 years if the tube is properly processed during bombardment and gas <b>back-filling.</b>|$|E
5000|$|An actual project {{designed}} to excavate the hillfort {{was developed by}} professors at the newly founded archaeology department of University College, Cardiff in the mid-1950s. In 1953, archaeologists Sir Cyril Fox, Dr V.E. Nash-Williams and Dr H.N. Savoy examined a variety of sites in southern Wales to decide {{which would be the}} best training site for the university's students, and eventually {{came to the conclusion that}} the Dinas Powys hillfort would be best. After gaining permission to excavate from Sir Herbert Merrett of the Cwrt-yr-Ala Estate Company and the Forestry Commission (the owners and tenants of the land respectively), and getting a small monetary grant from the Board of Celtic Studies, excavation began in January 1954. The excavations continued for four years, till 1958, mostly at weekends in spring and early summer, and also at Easter from 1954 through to 1957, and during July-August 1958. Following the financial support of the Board of Celtic Studies, grants were later made for the excavation by Glamorgan County Council, the Cambrian Archaeological Association, the British Academy, the Haverfield Trustees and the Society of Antiquaries. Most of the work was undertaken by volunteers, namely students from University College Cambridge, as well as from community archaeological societies both from Wales and from the rest of Britain. For the <b>back-filling</b> however, manual workmen were employed due to the more physical nature of the labour. The excavators decided to leave certain areas unexcavated, stating that [...] "Sufficient areas have been left unexcavated for future workers to have some chance of testing both the observation of facts and the hypotheses presented their conclusions." ...|$|E
