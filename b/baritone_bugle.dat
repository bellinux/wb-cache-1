50|$|Malaysian {{military}} {{bands are}} led by the percussion (snare drums either slung or mounted, bass drums, single and multiple tenor drums, cymbals and sometimes glockenspiels), and followed by the brass and woodwinds (with the addition of trumpets, mellophones, marching <b>baritone,</b> contrabass <b>bugles</b> and sousaphones), following a formation format {{that is similar to}} the Royal Marines and French military bands, and inspired by its long cultural heritage in music.|$|R
50|$|Tradition, by {{rules of}} DCA, is an any-key ensemble. This {{means that all}} bell-front brass {{instruments}} are legal to play in competition, such as Bb trumpets, F mellophones, Bb Contra Bass tubas, etc. However, keeping with tradition of older drum corps, Tradition fields a corps of almost all G bugles. The current 2011 season has Tradition with a full G bugle line. This makes Tradition {{one of the last}} drum corps to field a full G bugle line. Other notable exceptions include The Commandant's Own U.S. Marine Drum and Bugle Corps, and The United States Naval Academy Drum and Bugle Corps. Not only does Tradition employ a full G bugle line, the corps is the only competing corps in the United States, DCA or DCI, to still use piston/rotor <b>bugles.</b> The <b>Baritone</b> and Contrabass <b>bugle</b> sections are a mix of piston/rotor, two valve, and three valve bugles. The mellophone section is three valve, as well as most of the soprano line, with a few two valve sopranos in the mix.|$|R
