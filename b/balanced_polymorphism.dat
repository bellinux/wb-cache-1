The persistence of polymorphism in a population is generally explained by <b>balancing</b> selection. Color <b>polymorphisms</b> that are often found in many insects and arthropods are prime examples of the maintenance of <b>polymorphisms</b> via <b>balancing</b> selection. In some aphids, color morphs are maintained through frequency-dependent predation by two predatory insects. However, the presence of color polymorphism in ant-attended aphids cannot be explained by traditional balancing selection because these aphids are free from predation. We examined the selective advantages of the existence of two color (red and green) morphs in the ant-attended aphid, Macrosiphoniella yomogicola, in fields. We measured the degree of ant attendance on aphid colonies with different proportions of color morphs. The results show that the ants strongly favor aphid colonies with intermediate proportions of the two color morphs. The relationship between the degree of ant attendance and the proportion of color morphs in the field is convex when aphid colony size and ant colony size are controlled.

40|$|Background: Genomic and {{pathology}} {{analysis has}} revealed enormous diversity in genes involved in disease, including those encoding host resistance and parasite effectors (also known in plant pathology as avirulence genes). It {{has been proposed}} that such variation may persist when an organism exists in a spatially structured metapopulation, following the geographic mosaic of coevolution. Here, we study gene-for-gene relationships governing the outcome of plant-parasite interactions in a spatially structured system and, in particular, investigate the population genetic processes which maintain <b>balanced</b> <b>polymorphism</b> in both species. Results: Following previous theory {{on the effect of}} heterogeneous environments on maintenance of polymorphism, we analysed a model with two demes in which the demes have different environments and are coupled by gene flow. Environmental variation is manifested by different coefficients of natural selection, the costs to the host of resistance and to the parasite of virulence, the cost to the host of being diseased and the cost to an avirulent parasite of unsuccessfully attacking a resistant host. We show that migration generates negative direct frequency-dependent selection, a condition for maintenance of stable polymorphism in each deme. <b>Balanced</b> <b>polymorphism</b> occurs preferentially if there is heterogeneity for costs of resistance and virulence alleles among populations {{and to a lesser extent}} if there is variation in the cost to the host of being diseased.

40|$|Several {{empirical}} studies of sperm competition in populations polymorphic for a driving X chromosome {{have revealed that}} Sex-ratio males (those carrying a driving X) are at a disadvantage relative to Standard males. Because {{the frequency of the}} driving X chromosome determines the population-level sex ratio and thus alters male and female mating rates, the evolutionary consequences of sperm competition for sex chromosome meiotic drive are subtle. As the SR allele increases in frequency, the ratio of females to males also increases, causing an increase in the male mating rate and a decrease in the female mating rate. While the former change may exacerbate the disadvantage of Sex-ratio males during sperm competition, the latter change decreases the incidence of sperm competition within the population. We analyze a model of the effects of sperm competition on a driving X chromosome and show that these opposing trends in male and female mating rates can result in two coexisting locally stable equilibria, one corresponding to a <b>balanced</b> <b>polymorphism</b> of the SR and ST alleles and the second to fixation of the ST allele. Stochastic fluctuations of either the population sex ratio or the SR frequency can then drive the population away from the <b>balanced</b> <b>polymorphism</b> and into the basin of attraction for the second equilibrium, resulting in fixation of the SR allele and extinction of the population...|$|E

It was proposed that the stable heteroplasmicity might arise from a <b>balanced</b> <b>polymorphism</b> of suppressor and wild-type alleles of a tRNA gene maintained within the polyploid chloroplast genome. In the present study, we have focused on determining the molecular basis for the heteroplasmicity of one such revertant, named R 13 - 3 C, which was recovered from the 18 - 7 G amber (UAG) mutant. Restriction-enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing showed that the amber mutation is still present in the rbcL gene of the revertant strain. In contrast, DNA sequencing of the suspected tRNA(Trp) gene of the revertant revealed a mutation that would change its CCA anticodon to amber-specific CUA. This mutation was found to be heteroplasmic, being present in only 70 % of the tRNA(Trp) gene copies. Under nonselective conditions, the suppressor mutation was lost from cells that also lost the revertant phenotype.

On the basis of sequences of intron 12 of this gene, the expected low diversity was seen in both populations of the selfers Leavenworthia uniflora and L. torulosa and in three highly inbreeding populations of L. crassa, while high diversity was found in self-incompatible L. stylosa, and moderate diversity in L. crassa populations with partial or complete self-incompatibility. In L. stylosa, the nucleotide diversity was strongly structured into three haplotypic classes, differing by several insertion/deletion sequences, with linkage disequilibrium between sequences of the three types in intron 12, {{but not in the}} adjacent regions. Differences between the three kinds of haplotypes are larger than between sequences of this gene region from different species. The haplotype divergence suggests the presence of a <b>balanced</b> <b>polymorphism</b> at this locus, possibly predating the split between L. stylosa and its two inbreeding sister taxa, L. uniflora and L. torulosa.

40|$|The coding {{regions of}} many of the major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) (human leukocyte antigen [HLA] in humans) molecules are believed to be subject to balancing selection. But it is less certain whether the regulatory regions of such coding sequences are also subject to the same type of selection. Here, we studied the polymorphism of the regulatory regions of the HLA-DPA 1 and HLA-DPB 1 genes among ethnic minorities in southwestern China. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two deep clades > 10 million years old. There is almost complete linkage disequilibrium between the regulatory and coding regions of HLA-DPA 1, which hints at coadaptive balancing selection on the entire region. Thus, the molecular mechanism of balancing selection in MHC may involve expression modulation in addition to coding-region polymorphisms. Although the frequency of clade II is > 30 % in some ethnic minorities, it decreases to < 5 % among southern Han Chinese and vanishes among Europeans.

40|$|Balancing {{selection}} {{is an important}} evolutionary force that maintains genetic and phenotypic diversity in populations. Most studies in humans have focused on long-standing balancing selection, which persists {{over long periods of}} time and is generally shared across populations.

To better understand the role of previously balanced alleles in novel adaptations, we analyzed in detail four loci as case examples of this mechanism. These loci show hallmark signatures of long-term balancing selection in African populations, but not in Eurasian populations. The disparity between populations is due to changes in allele frequencies, with intermediate frequency alleles in Africans (likely due to balancing selection) segregating instead at low- or high-derived allele frequency in Eurasia. We explicitly tested the support for different evolutionary models with an approximate Bayesian computation approach and show that the patterns in PKDREJ, SDR 39 U 1, and ZNF 473 are best explained by recent changes in selective pressure in certain populations. Specifically, we infer that alleles previously under long-term balancing selection, or alleles linked to them, were recently targeted by positive selection in Eurasian populations.

40|$|Not much {{is known}} about the {{mechanisms}} affecting the genetic composition of populations of different species. To investi­gate one of these potential mechanisms, mating behaviour, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, was chosen as an experimen­tal animal. To quantify mating behaviour in easily measurable parameters, it was subdivided into several distinct components; mating activity, mating time, mating competition ability and male mating capacity. As behavioural components to a great extent are influenced by environmental conditions all experiments were performed under controlled temperature and humidity. All components of mating behaviour were estimated by introducing females and males into mating chambers. Mating behaviour seems {{to be one of the}} major factors affect­ing the genetic composition of Drosophila melanogaster popula­tions. The experiments performed showed that differences in mating properties led to a substantial sexual selection among the genotypes. This selection was of a stabilizing type with regard to characters associated to bristle number and Y chromo­somal chromatin. This selection situation seems to warrant the retention of intermediate phenotypes in a population and will therefore contribute to the genetic variation present. Differences in mating properties were also shown to be able to maintain a <b>balanced</b> <b>polymorphism</b> for allozyme variants in populations. This maintenance was obtained through different forms of balancing selection as heterozygous superiority in sexual activity and balancing selection between female and male genotypes.

Although R genes {{often fail to}} provide durable resistance in an agricultural context, they frequently persist as long-lived balanced polymorphisms in nature. Standard theory explains the maintenance of such polymorphisms through a balance of {{the costs and benefits}} of resistance and virulence in a tightly coevolving host-pathogen pair. However, many plant-pathogen interactions lack such specificity. Whether, and how, balanced polymorphisms are maintained in diffusely interacting species is unknown. Here we identify a naturally interacting R gene and effector pair in Arabidopsis thaliana and its facultative plant pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae. The protein encoded by the R gene RPS 5 recognizes an AvrPphB homologue (AvrPphB 2) and exhibits a <b>balanced</b> <b>polymorphism</b> that has been maintained for over 2 million years (ref. 3). Consistent with the presence of an ancient <b>balanced</b> <b>polymorphism,</b> the R gene confers a benefit when plants are infected with P. syringae carrying avrPphB 2 but also incurs a large cost in the absence of infection. RPS 5 alleles are maintained at intermediate frequencies in populations globally, suggesting ubiquitous selection for resistance. However, the presence of P. syringae carrying avrPphB is probably insufficient to explain the RPS 5 polymorphism. First, avrPphB homologues occur at very low frequencies in P. syringae populations on A. thaliana. Second, AvrPphB only rarely confers a virulence benefit to P. syringae on A. thaliana. Instead, we find evidence that selection for RPS 5 involves multiple non-homologous effectors and multiple pathogen species. These results and an associated model suggest that the R gene polymorphism in A. thaliana may not be maintained through a tightly coupled interaction involving a single coevolved R gene and effector pair. More likely, the stable polymorphism is maintained through complex and diffuse community-wide interactions...|$|E

In this paper we review the current explanations for their deleterious eects and we argue that it is highly improbable that all newly emerged SR are suciently deleterious to avoid fixation. Unbalanced SR almost certainly arise and go unnoticed because of three possible outcomes: (i) fixation followed by extinction of the population or species; (ii) fixation followed by the emergence and fixation of drive suppressors, restoring the normal 1 : 1 sexual proportion; or (iii) transformation into balanced SR due to partial suppression. If these outcomes really occur, then extant cases of sex-chromosome meiotic drive such as SR, causing small deviations on the population sexual proportion, are only the tip of the iceberg and strong sexual proportion shifts (possibly followed by extinction) are a more common feature of species evolution than is usually assumed...|$|R
