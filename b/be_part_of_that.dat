500|$|... piouhgd (pronounced [...] "p.o.-ed", as in [...] "pissed off") was the band's fifth {{full-length}} studio album, {{and their}} first for Rough Trade. Released in April 1991, it featured more electronic instrumentation, but was largely {{viewed as a}} disappointment in comparison to past recordings. Both Haynes and Leary have since expressed displeasure with the album. Regardless, the band was invited to <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> summer's inaugural Lollapalooza tour. Around this time Haynes collaborated with Ministry, contributing vocals on their 1991 single [...] "Jesus Built My Hotrod", which was later included on 1992's [...]|$|E
500|$|Orr was {{noticed by}} the Boston Bruins {{in the spring}} of 1961, playing in a youth hockey tournament in Gananoque, Ontario. The Bruins' Wren Blair {{described}} him as [...] "a combination of Doug Harvey and Eddie Shore." [...] The Bruins immediately pursued Orr. Blair made regular visits to the family home. In the fall of 1961, the Bruins invested C$1,000 (C$ in [...] dollars) to sponsor his minor hockey team. Although three other NHL teams (Toronto Maple Leafs, Detroit Red Wings and Montreal Canadiens) were interested in Orr, he signed in 1962 with the Bruins. Orr explained that he signed with the Bruins because [...] "they're a team of the future. They're rebuilding and I want to <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> building program." ...|$|E
500|$|Up {{until the}} World War, other {{branches}} of the Army had their own specialty schools, but the infantry did not. This situation was being amended, and Middleton would <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> change as a new faculty member of the Infantry School at Camp Benning, about nine miles from Columbus. [...] Middleton, whose rank had reverted to his permanent rank of captain following the war, was an instructor in the new school for {{his first two years}} at Benning, and {{also a member of the}} Infantry Board, set up for research on weapons and tactics. One of his jobs on the board was to evaluate new weapons and equipment, and at one point he tested a new semiautomatic rifle which would eventually become the M-1 rifle, the standard weapon of the infantry in World War II.|$|E

500|$|When the two {{began working}} on a song that Stefani stated was too personal, she left to visit Kanal. He played her a track on {{which he had been}} working and which became [...] "Crash", the album's final single. The two tried to write new material, but gave up after two weeks. They did not return to work until six months later, when Stefani began collaborating with other artists, commenting, [...] "If I were to write the chorus of 'Yesterday' by the Beatles, and that's all I wrote, that would be good enough to <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> history." [...] Stefani resumed work with Linda Perry, who invited Dallas Austin, and many other artists, {{including}} Outkast's André 3000, the Neptunes, and Dr. Dre. Stefani announced the album's release in early 2004, marketing it as a [...] "dance record" [...] and a [...] "guilty pleasure".|$|E
500|$|In early 2003, Stefani began {{embarking on}} {{recording}} sessions for her debut album. After listening to songs recommended {{to her by}} No Doubt bassist and former boyfriend Tony Kanal, she considered recording material that [...] "modernized 1980s music". After writing a series of several songs, including [...] "Serious", [...] "Crash", and [...] "Luxurious", the pair gave up after Stefani didn't find anything worth recording from the sessions. When asked about the aforementioned collaborations, Stefani expressed her doubts {{of whether or not}} her newly recorded material would be any good: [...] "If I were to write the chorus of 'Yesterday' by the Beatles, and that's all I wrote, that would be good enough to <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> history." [...] Due to Stefani's doubts, the project began a six-month hiatus, which resulted in the singer deciding to collaborate with various new musicians instead. Stefani's change of heart also ensured her work with Kanal would end up on Love. Angel. Music. Baby..|$|E
500|$|Casting {{director}} Ruth Lambert held {{a series}} of casting auditions for the film in New York, Los Angeles, and London, but the crew already had some actors in mind for two of the major characters. The character of Dr. Doppler was written with David Hyde Pierce in mind, and Pierce was given a copy of the Treasure Planet script along with preliminary sketches of the character and the film's scenic elements while he was working on Pixar's A Bug's Life (1998). He stated that [...] "the script was fantastic, the look was so compelling" [...] that he accepted the role. Likewise, the character of Captain Amelia was developed with the idea that Emma Thompson would be providing her voice. [...] "We offered it to her and she was really excited," [...] Clements said. Musker said, [...] "This is the first action adventure character that Emma has ever played and she was pregnant during several of the sessions. She was happy that she could do all this action and not have to train for the part" [...] There were no actors initially in mind for the characters of John Silver and Jim Hawkins; Brian Murray (John Silver) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Jim Hawkins) were signed after months of auditions. Gordon-Levitt stated that he was attracted to the role because [...] "it's a Disney animated movie and Disney animated movies are in a class by themselves," [...] and that [...] "to <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> tradition is unbelievable to me". Musker mentioned that Gordon-Levitt [...] "combined enough vulnerability and intelligence and a combination of youthfulness but incompleteness" [...] and that they liked his approach.|$|E

2500|$|County boroughs {{were to be}} {{administrative}} {{counties of}} themselves. [...] The Act provided that each county borough {{that had previously been}} part of a county (i.e., was not a county corporate) should continue to <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> county for non-administrative purposes. [...] If a county borough did not have a separate commission of assize, oyer and terminer and jury service, or gaol delivery, it was deemed to be part of one or more adjoining counties for those purposes. [...] The Act also provided for certain financial adjustments between county boroughs and adjoining counties.|$|E
2500|$|In a mixed review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{wrote that}} the [...] "band floats out of time, {{inspired}} heavily by '90s alt rock but too clean, heavy, and facile to truly <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> tradition, yet too indebted to the past to sound like part of the 2000s, either." [...] He found the band [...] "capable enough at shifting from tense quiet verses to piledriving, heavy choruses, but they borrow the worst habits from all their favorite groups, and then assemble them in insufferably earnest fashion, playing clichés {{as if they were}} revelations." [...] Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone stated, [...] "espite some credible modern-rock tunes, Leto's self-involved myopia guarantees that his band's second disc is long on melodrama." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schuckardt and an {{associate}} Denis Chicoine began a national lecture circuit advocating a return to traditional Catholicism. Due to their outspoken rejection of the Second Vatican Council and embrace of sedevacantism, Schuckardt and his followers were denounced by the Roman Catholic Church. However several traditional-minded Catholic priests (some Jesuits and diocesan priests) had joined Schuckhardt and would provide the Fatima Crusade with the traditional, Roman Rite of the sacraments and the Mass. In his public discourses (which were preserved on audiotape), then-Brother Schuckardt reminded his followers that, despite the apostasy of Vatican II, Christ would most certainly provide for legitimate apostolic succession in [...] "the Catholic Church." [...] He is on record as saying that he [...] "never expected" [...] himself [...] "to <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> succession".|$|E

2500|$|In {{light of}} Wilson's {{increasingly}} fragile mental state, the group tensions, and his signing to Warner Bros., Parks's involvement in Smile effectively ceased on April 14, 1967, {{when he left}} to begin work on his solo career. Giving his reasons, he said, [...] "I {{walked away from the}} situation as soon as I realized that I was causing friction between him and his other group members, and I didn't want to be the person to do that. I thought that was Brian's responsibility to bring definition to his own life. I stepped in, perhaps, I 'took a leap before I looked'. I don't know, but that's the way I feel about it.…As soon as I found out I was entering an eat or be eaten situation... I was raised differently. I didn't want to <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> game." [...] Recording sessions ground to a halt soon after, as Wilson became increasingly withdrawn, and the album was shelved a few months later.|$|E
2500|$|During Osbourne's {{appearance}} on The Graham Norton Show, she stated, {{in reference to}} Minogue, [...] "She knows she's there because of her looks, not because of her contribution to the music industry." [...] In a press conference held on 12 December 2007, when asked why she had been publicly talking about Minogue, Osbourne said [...] "It's an even playing field, Dannii speaks about me, I speak about her." [...] Minogue said in turn [...] "I've looked up to Sharon and Louis for years and I wanted to <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> gang. But when they're slating you, you think: 'Please don't, I really like you.'" [...] Cowell admitted that Osbourne did not feel comfortable about having a new judge and that Osbourne and Minogue would never be [...] "the best of buddies," [...] adding that if Osbourne wanted to leave the show, he would let her (in fact, Osbourne left after series 4). The Daily Mail reported that Cowell was forced to sit the judges down, asking them to maintain a civil relationship with each other behind the scenes. The apparent flirting between Cowell and Minogue also generated comment in the popular media.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2014, after a {{television}} series {{extension of the}} One-Shot Agent Carter was ordered by ABC, the short's composer Christopher Lennertz talked {{about the possibility of}} him being involved with the series saying Louis D'Esposito, the One-Shot director also involved with the series, wanted Lennertz involved, before officially signing on to compose for the series that September. On his music for the series, Lennertz said, [...] "I get to mix {{a lot of things that}} don’t often get to go together in terms of period, music, jazz, trumpet, mixed with orchestra, mixed with electronics and brushes on a drum set and things." [...] He researched [...] "what was going on between '46 and 1950 and what it was that would <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> era ... I knew Count Basie. I knew Glenn Miller, all those things were happening at the time, but then we also figured out that it was sort of changing from big band to smaller jazz ensembles." [...] This led to Lennertz focusing a lot on trumpets for Peggy Carter's sound, [...] "which makes a lot of sense because it’s also very sneaky, and it lends itself to espionage and that kind of thing". Lennertz introduced a folk choral piece performed by a Russian men's choir during [...] "The Iron Ceiling".|$|E

2500|$|In the {{previous}} few years, SoftKey founder Kevin O'Leary had wanted the new The Learning Company {{to collaborate with}} developers to [...] "produce products to service that 40 {{percent of the market}} that hasn't bought educational software because of pricing issues." [...] This resulted in a new budget line of [...] "Platinum" [...] CD-ROM products; during this period The Learning Company would become known for aggressively driving down the development costs of products, and laying off employees in the companies it acquired. Post-1997 Madeline products were manufactured by BMG's manufacturing division, Sonopress, and order fulfillment was handled by BMG Distribution. These products were distributed {{to a wide range of}} retail outlets including: Best Buy, Circuit City, Computer City, Egghead Software, Office Depot, Price Club/Costco, Sam's Club, and Staples. [...] Robin Ray of the Boston Herald noted in 1998 that while new releases in kid's software used to be in the $50 range, they were now being released at $35, and with a rebate or a few months wait customers could often get them for half price; he deemed the repackaging of two separate games into Madeline's Thinking Games Deluxe as a [...] "bargain." [...] While Madeline and Magnificent Puppet Show had been released with a retail price of $49.95 three years prior, Madeline Rainy Day Activities and Madeline Thinking Games Deluxe were launched in late 1998 at a price of $19.95, [...] "in time to meet holiday demands for entertainment software to complement cross-curricular products."

2500|$|By the 83rd Minnesota Legislative Session Lindner {{had already}} faced an ethics {{complaint}} before. This {{was a result}} of his reaction to the request of Rep. Paymar. His first complaint stemmed from a May 2000 incident after the Republican Party took control of the House and some members felt that the prayers opening the session were becoming too sectarian. [...] "For many, things went too far when House leaders recently brought in a choir to open the day's session with a musical rendition of the Apostles' Creed." [...] In light of this Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) who is Jewish said [...] "I would like to <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> moment where a religious leader gets up before us and has a prayer. But I would like that to be non-denominational, and I would like it to be respectful of who I am." [...] In response to his and others' concerns a rule was passed [...] "requiring that in the future, prayer be non-denominational." [...] In responding to Paymar, Lindner said [...] "You know, we're told there's one God and one mediator between God and man. That man is Jesus Christ. And most of us here are Christians. And we shouldn't be left not able to pray in the name of our God....And if you don't like it, you may have to like it-Or just don't come. I don't come sometimes for some prayers here....We have that privilege, and you need to exercise it. But don't impose your irreligious left views on me." [...] Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), called on Lindner [...] "to rethink his comments. When Lindner refused to reply, Entenza put forth a 'protest of dissent' petition asking the House Ethics Committee to reprimand Lindner. It was signed by 60 House members, including eight Republicans." [...] Later “The ethics panel found the comments ‘regrettable’, but took no disciplinary action.” ...|$|E
