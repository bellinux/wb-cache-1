40|$|AbstractPlants {{are known}} to {{scavenge}} nutrients such as phosphorus (P) from rock subtrates and concentrate those nutrients at the surface {{in order to satisfy}} long-term nutritional requirements. Using the stable isotope systematics of calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr) and <b>barium</b> (<b>Ba)</b> <b>as</b> proxy tracers, here we test the hypothesis that soils along a Hawaiian climosequence have “biolifted” P and other nutrients such as Ca from depth and concentrated those nutrients at the surface. Relative to isotope compositions in the volcanic soil parent materials, exchangeable Ca, Sr and Ba in the shallowest soils at sites having evidence for P biolifting are light confirming the role for plant uptake of these elements while exchangeable Ca, Sr and Ba of deeper soils at those sites are similar or heavy suggesting a complementary pool. In this pedogenic system Ca and Sr are more susceptible to leaching than Ba, thus Ba isotopes provide the most resilient evidence for biolifting across the climate gradient and a useful proxy for P biodynamics...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the abundances of heavy neutron-capture elements, including osmium (Os) and iridium (Ir), in the two carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) subgiants CS 31062 - 050 and LP 625 - 44. CS 31062 - 050 {{is known to be}} a so-called CEMP-r/s star, which exhibits large excesses of s-process elements such <b>as</b> <b>barium</b> (<b>Ba)</b> and lead (Pb), as well as a significant enhancement of europium (Eu) that cannot be explained by conventional s-process production in asymptotic giant branch star models. Our analysis of the high-resolution spectrum for this object has determined, for the first time, the abundances of Ir and Os, elements in the third peak of the r-process nucleosynthesis. They also exhibit significant excesses relative to the predictions of standard s-process calculations. These two elements are not detected in a similar quality spectrum of LP 625 - 44; the derived upper limits on their abundances are lower than the abundances in CS 31062 - 050. We compare the observed abundance patterns of neutron-capture elements, including Os and Ir, in these two stars with recent model calculations of the s-process, and we discuss possible interpretations...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed determines lead (Pb), {{antimony}} (Sb) and <b>barium</b> (<b>Ba)</b> <b>as</b> the major elements present in GSR {{in the environmental}} air of the Ballistics Laboratory of the Sao Paulo Criminalistics Institute (I. C. -S. P.), Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil. Micro environmental monitors (mini samplers) were located at selected places. The PM 2. 5 fraction of this airborne was collected in, previously weighted filters, and analyzed by sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (SF-HR-ICP-MS). The higher values of the airborne lead, antimony and barium, were found at the firing range (lead (Pb) : 58. 9 mu g/m(3); barium (Ba) : 6. 9 mu g/m(3); antimony (Sb) : 7. 3 mu g/m(3)). The mean value of the airborne in this room during 6 monitored days was Pb: 23. 1 mu g/m(3); Ba: 2. 2 mu g/m(3); Sb: 1. 5 mu g/m(3). In the water tank room, the air did not show levels above the limits of concern. In general the airborne lead changed from day to day, but the barium and antimony remained constant. Despite of that, the obtained values suggest that the workers may be exposed to airborne lead concentration that can result in an unhealthy environment and could {{increase the risk of}} chronic intoxication.

40|$|The {{physiological}} and pharmacological {{properties of the}} � 1 E calcium (Ca) channel subtype do not exactly match any of the established categories described for native neuronal Ca currents. Many of the key diagnostic features used to assign cloned Ca channels to their native counterparts, however, are dependent {{on a number of}} factors, including cellular environment, � subunit coexpression, and modulation by second messengers and G-proteins. Here, by examining the intrinsic pore characteristics of a family of transiently expressed neuronal Ca channels, we demonstrate that the permeation properties of � 1 E closely resemble those described for a subset of lowthreshold Ca channels. The � 1 A (P-/Q-type), � 1 B (N-type), and � 1 C (L-type) high-threshold Ca channels all exhibit larger whole-cell currents with <b>barium</b> (<b>Ba)</b> <b>as</b> the charge carrier as compared with Ca or strontium (Sr). In contrast, macroscopic � 1 E currents are largest in Sr, followed by Ca and then Ba. The unique permeation properties of � 1 E are maintained at the single-channel level, are independent {{of the nature of the}} expression system, and are not affected by coexpression of � 2 and � subunits. Overall, the permeation characteristics of � 1 E are distinct from those described for R-type currents and share some similarities with native low-threshold Ca channels.

40|$|International audienceThe {{transport}} of barium atoms and ions {{in the vicinity}} of the hot spot in fluorescent lamps operating at 25 kHz is investigated by a combined experimental and theoretical approach. By laserinduced fluorescence, the particle densities of barium atoms and ions were measured timeresolved at different distances from the spot center. In addition, the time-dependent cathode fall voltage was measured using an improved band method. The model combines a kinetic part for the electrons with a fluid part for the barium atoms and ions. Both parts are spatially resolved in spherically symmetric geometry. The space-dependent electron Boltzmann equation yields the electron density and the ionization rate coefficient of <b>barium</b> <b>as</b> functions of the cathode fall voltage. These results are used to solve the time-dependent particle balance equations of barium atoms and ions which include the ionization of <b>barium</b> <b>as</b> gain and loss terms, respectively. Good agreement between the measured and calculated particle densities of barium atoms is obtained. A sensitive dependence of the ionization frequency and of the barium particle densities on the cathode fall voltage was found...|$|R
