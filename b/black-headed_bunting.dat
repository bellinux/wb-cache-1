50|$|The female is a washed-out {{version of}} the male, with paler underparts, a grey-brown back and a greyish head. The {{juvenile}} is similar, and both {{can be difficult to}} separate from the corresponding plumages of <b>black-headed</b> <b>bunting.</b>|$|E
50|$|It breeds {{in central}} Asia. It is migratory, {{wintering}} in India and Bangladesh. Its status in western Europe, {{where it is}} a potential vagrant, is confused by escapes, especially as this species is more commonly recorded than the closely related <b>black-headed</b> <b>bunting,</b> despite the latter having a more westerly breeding range. Reports in Britain have declined dramatically over recent years, coinciding with the decline in Asiatic imports for the cage-bird trade.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 High {{severity}} fire is {{a historical}} and integral disturbance process in coniferous forest types. Compounded disturbances such as multiple fires or post-disturbance management activities are increasingly common, but ecological responses are not well understood and may represent novel types of disturbances. I studied bird and small mammal communities in the mixed severity fire regime of the Siskiyou Mountains of southwestern Oregon, USA, at various points in time after one or two high severity fires {{in and around the}} historic 200, 000 -ha Biscuit Fire. Post-disturbance time intervals included 2 - 4 years after a single fire, 17 - 18 years after a single fire, 2 - 3 years after a repeat fire (15 year interval between fires), and > 100 years since stand-replacement fire (mature/old-growth forest). Additionally, I examined the response of these communities to postfire salvage logging of the Biscuit Fire. Avian species richness did not differ significantly among habitats. Among the recently burned habitats, bird density was highest 17 - 18 -years after fire and lowest 2 years after a single fire. Sites 17 - 18 years postfire were dominated by broad-leaved shrubs. Ordination of community data revealed two distinct gradients in avian species composition, one relating to tree structure (live, dead-sound, dead-decayed) and another relating to shrub volume and height. Bird density was positively related to shrub height and volume; increases in broad-leaved plants following fire were associated with significant increases in bird density. Immediately after a single high severity fire event, small mammal communities transitioned from low abundance and high species richness to high abundance and low species richness dominated by deer mice. Partial recovery to a pre-burn state was evident 17 years after fire with wood rats being present but vole species still absent relative to unburned mature forest. Repeat fire was associated with heightened abundance of deer mice and herbaceous cover. Postfire salvage logging created a significant pulse of woody debris but no significant changes in densities or biomass of small mammals were observed. Fire effects on small mammal communities were much larger than those of postfire salvage logging in the short term. Longer term studies of changes in small mammal communities following salvage logging are needed over decades and greater time scales to fully evaluate the impacts of the management activity. To examine bird response to postfire salvage logging, we used point counts to measure changes in densities and occurrence for 17 common bird species. Response was measured at two spatial scales (20 ha and 2 ha) relative to two measures of salvage logging: proportion of surrounding area logged and logging intensity (basal area removed). The 20 -ha scale comprised the logging unit as well as unit edges and surrounding unlogged areas, while the 2 -ha scale comprised only the logging unit and not surrounding edges. At the 20 -ha scale, we found a positive response in the density of shrub-associated species (house wren, lazuli <b>bunting,</b> <b>black-headed</b> grosbeak [scientific names given in Appendix A]) and edge-associated species (olive-sided flycatcher, yellow-rumped warbler) and little evidence of negative responses, save for a reduction in density of Hammond’s flycatcher. At the 2 -ha scale, shrub-associates again responded positively but not edge-associates. Brown creeper responded negatively at the 2 -ha scale and five species had suggestive negative trends but they were not significant suggesting that, except for shrub nesting species, bird use of salvage units is associated with edges and not interior portions of salvage units. The lack of a strong negative response to salvage logging of the Biscuit Fire suggests that the small logging unit sizes relative to the burn area, as well as extensive snag retention in riparian buffers, tended to retain many bird species in the burn landscape...|$|R
5000|$|... == Nature == Natural {{habitats}} include semi-desert, calcareous grasslands, and juniper woodlands alternated with cliffs, canyons, {{and rocky}} outcrops. Vicinity of Areni community {{have been considered}} as a Prime Butterfly Area, where wide variety of rare butterflies, including Papilio alexanor, Colias chlorocoma, Colias aurorina, Pseudochazara schahrudensis, Tomares romanovi, Callophrys paulae, and number of others can be observed.Also the area is interesting for bird observations, being inhabited by Egyptian Vulture, White-throated Robin, Eastern Rock Nuthatch, <b>Black-headed</b> <b>Bunting,</b> and number of other species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black-headed</b> <b>bunting</b> breeds in open scrubby areas {{including}} agricultural land. In winter {{they move}} to Asia and large flocks are found in agricultural fields and grasslands. The longest migration noted from a ringed individual is about 7,000 km. Another ringed bird was determined to have flown 1,000 km in seven days. Males form pure flocks during migration and arrive in the winter quarters well before the females. The winter range within India is mainly in western and northern India extending south to northern Karnataka. In winter they form large communal roosts in thorny acacia trees, often joining other species such as the yellow-throated sparrow.|$|E
50|$|The very {{attractive}} and unreachable Caspian snowcock (Tetraogallus caspius) lives at high altitudes. Golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) breeds in this area. Griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) are common. Chukar partridge (Alectoris chukar) {{has a high}} population and nests between stone and shrubs. Red-fronted serin (Serinus pusillus), linnet (Carduelis cannabina), snow finch (Montifringilla nivalis), rock sparrow (Petronia petronia), rock bunting (Emberiza cia) and horned lark (Eremophila alpestris) are native; in winter {{they come to the}} lower hill sides. In each spring wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe), rock thrush (Monticola saxatilis), and nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos) come from Africa for breeding. Grey-necked bunting (Emberiza buchanani), <b>black-headed</b> <b>bunting</b> (Emberiza melanocephala) and common rosefinch (Carpodacus erythrinus) come from India.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black-headed</b> <b>bunting</b> (Emberiza melanocephala) is a {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} bunting family Emberizidae. It breeds in south-east Europe east to Iran and migrates {{in winter}} mainly to India, with some individuals moving further into south-east Asia. Like others in its family, it is found in open grassland habitats where they fly in flocks in search of grains and seed. Adult males are well marked with yellow underparts, chestnut back and a black head. Adult females in breeding plumage look like duller males. In other plumages, they {{can be hard to}} separate from the closely related red-headed bunting and natural hybridization occurs between the two species in the zone of overlap of their breeding ranges in northern Iran.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>black-headed</b> <b>bunting</b> {{is found}} in flocks as it forages on grasslands for seeds. They breed in summer, {{building}} a nest in a low bush or on the ground. The nest is a cup made of dry grass and lined with hair. The clutch consists of four to six eggs. The eggs hatch after about 13 days and the chicks fledge after about 10 days. Its natural food consists of insects when feeding young, and otherwise seeds. In Bulgaria, {{the collapse of the}} drying cotton thistle (Onopordum acanthium) stems on which the birds build their nests has caused high mortality; this is thought to be an example of an ecological trap. In northern Iran, there is a region of range overlap with the red-headed bunting and natural hybrids are common although molecular data indicates that there is considerable genetic divergence between the two species.|$|E
50|$|Krumovitsa Important Bird Area {{supports}} 136 bird species. Sixty-four are {{species of}} European conservation concern (SPEC), {{two of them}} being included in category SPEC 1 as globally threatened, 18 in SPEC 2, and 44 in SPEC 3 as species threatened in Europe. The area is of global importance, {{as it is a}} representative biome for the Mediterranean zone. Seven biome-restricted species, typical for the Mediterranean zone out of nine established in Bulgaria, occur there: black-eared wheatear (Oenanthe hispanica), olive-tree warbler (Hippolais olivetorum), subalpine warbler (Sylvia cantillans), Sardinian warbler (Sylvia melanocephala), rock nuthatch (Sitta neumayer), masked shrike (Lanius nubicus) and <b>black-headed</b> <b>bunting</b> (Emberiza melanocephala). Krumovitsa {{is one of the few}} places in Bulgaria where the cinereous vulture (Aegypius monachus) and lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) still can be observed. Krumovitsa provides suitable habitats for 46 species, included in Annex 2 of the Biodiversity Act, which need special conservation measures. Thirty-eight of them are listed also in Annex I of the Birds Directive and more than half of them breed in the region in significant populations. The region of the Krumovitsa is one of the most important sites in the country on a European Union scale for the breeding black stork (Ciconia nigra), Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), booted eagle (Hieraaetus pennatus) and olive-tree warbler.|$|E
40|$|Both habitat {{changes and}} {{predation}} can cause population declines in farmland birds. Habitat changes may allow novel or invasive alien predators to establish populations in new environments, which can have major ecological consequences for native prey species. We studied {{effects of a}} novel avian predator, the Montagu's Harrier (Circus pygargus), on the survival of male Black-headed Buntings (Emberiza melanocephala). Between 2011 and 2015, survival of 35 territorial <b>Black-headed</b> <b>Bunting</b> males was monitored and their apparent survival in years with and without predators was computed. The apparent monthly survival (reported ± SE) was very high during the breeding seasons when Montagu's Harrier was not present (0. 957 ± 0. 035) {{as well as in}} nonbreeding periods (0. 981 ± 0. 011). It was significantly lower during the breeding season of 2013 when Montagu's Harrier was present in the area (0. 600 ± 0. 136). Changes in habitat structure due to alteration in agricultural practice and temporal changes in weather conditions have presumably enabled Montagu's Harriers to breed in the study area and led to increases in the importance of birds in Montagu's Harrier's diet. The appearance of Montagu's Harriers in the study area strongly coincided with the steep decrease in the apparent survival of the male Black-headed Buntings. The lack of appropriate response in male Black-headed Buntings made them extremely vulnerable to attacks of this aerial predator...|$|E
