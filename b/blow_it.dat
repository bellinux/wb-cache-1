5|$|After the Third Battle of Ypres petered out in late 1917, the Western Front {{fell into}} its usual lull {{over the winter}} months. In early 1918, it became {{apparent}} to the Allies that a large German offensive was pending. This Spring Offensive commenced on 21 March 1918, with over one million men in three German armies striking hard near the junction between the French and British armies. The main effort of this offensive hit the British Fifth Army, which formed the right flank of the British front line. Struck a staggering <b>blow,</b> <b>it</b> began a rapid and at times panicked withdrawal. The key railway junction at Amiens was soon threatened.|$|E
5|$|Most residents, {{including}} the mayor, supported the parliamentarians during the English Civil War, although its military governor, Colonel Goring, supported the royalists. The town {{became a major}} base for the parliamentarian navy and was blockaded from the sea. Parliamentarian troops were sent to raid it by land in the Siege of Portsmouth; the guns of Southsea Castle were fired at the royalist garrison in the town. Across the harbour, parliamentarians in Gosport joined in the assault, with their guns damaging St Thomas's Church. On 5September 1642, the remaining royalists in the garrison at the Square Tower were forced to surrender after Goring threatened to <b>blow</b> <b>it</b> up with gunpowder. In return, he and his garrison were allowed safe passage.|$|E
5|$|Kirk {{resolves}} {{to enter}} the Rip. After Enterprise enters the Gorn's galaxy, Kirk and Spock take a shuttle with Sulu (voiced by John Cho) and Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban) to a nearby planet. When their shuttle is shot down, Kirk and Spock use wingsuits to glide to a Gorn outpost and <b>blow</b> <b>it</b> up before infiltrating a base to rescue T'Mar. They find Daniels, who is killed in an ensuing firefight. The Gorn bring Kirk and Spock to the Commander, who has them taken to an arena to fight his soldiers to the death. Angered by their besting of his champion, the Commander has Spock infected with the virus and pits him against Kirk. Sulu's shuttle arrives and McCoy shoots Spock with an antidote, while the Commander flees to his ship with T'Mar and the device.|$|E

5|$|The {{storming}} of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, {{had been}} celebrated annually since 1790, initially through quasi-religious rituals, {{and then later}} during the Revolution with grand, secular events including the burning of replica Bastilles. Under Napoleon the events became less revolutionary, focusing instead on military parades and national unity {{in the face of}} foreign threats. During the 1870s, the 14 July celebrations became a rallying point for Republicans opposed to the early monarchist leadership of the Third Republic; when the moderate Republican Jules Grévy became president in 1879, his new government turned the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille into a national holiday. The anniversary remained contentious, with hard-line Republicans continuing to use the occasion to protest against the new political order and right-wing conservatives protesting about the imposition of the holiday. The July Column itself remained contentious and Republican radicals unsuccessfully tried to <b>blow</b> <b>it</b> up in 1871.|$|E
5|$|Ethalion {{took over}} pursuit of Bellone from Melampus, {{and for two}} hours {{maintained}} continuous fire with her bow-chasers on the French ship. Ethalion was faster than her quarry, and she slowly pulled parallel with Bellone during the afternoon, but could not get close enough for a decisive <b>blow.</b> <b>It</b> took another two hours of pursuit before the battered Bellone eventually surrendered. Hoche apart, Bellone had suffered more casualties than any other ship present. To the south of this conflict, the struggling Anson discovered herself in danger when the surviving frigates of the French vanguard swept towards her en masse. Captain Durham was initially confused by their approach {{as he had been}} too distant to witness the action and the French ships flew false British ensigns, but he rapidly realised their true identity and at 16:00 opened fire on Loire. The damaged Anson was severely hampered by her inability to manoeuvre, and so could do nothing when the French ships pulled back and sailed away, except to continue to fire until they were out of range. During the evening, the surviving French frigates gradually pulled away from their pursuers and disappeared into the gathering night, leaving behind four of their squadron, including their flagship, as captives.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Bart enlists Lisa to {{help find}} out what Sideshow Bob is up to, but only ends up being {{discovered}} rummaging in Bob's trash and angrily escorted home by him. They finally decide to search in Bob's trailer at the dam construction site, and discover a briefcase full of cash. On being interrupted by Bob, the children run and hide inside the dam's turbine room, but are cornered. When confronted with the money, Bob denies knowing anything about it, stating that he's putting up his finances to build the dam walls out of concrete, but is distraught to see the walls empty and poorly constructed. The kids then believe that Bob is cutting back on construction materials by embezzling the money for himself, but Cecil shows up {{with a gun and}} reveals that {{he is the one who}} embezzled the money; now he plans on framing Bob and using him as a scapegoat when the poorly constructed dam collapses. He officially declares his greed of the money motivated him to enact his plan, though he privately admits to Bob that his true motivation was because of Bob being chosen as Krusty's sidekick instead of Cecil. Without hesitation, Cecil locks Bob, Bart and Lisa in the dam and prepares to <b>blow</b> <b>it</b> up, taking the money with him.|$|E

5|$|The NWA World Tag Team Championship was {{defended by}} America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm; AMW) against Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) next. Gail Kim {{accompanied}} AMW to the ring. Mid-way through the bout, Team 3D performed their signature Whassup? maneuver on Storm. Kim interfered in the bout, distracting the referee. Around this time, Devon retrieved a table {{from under the}} ring which both teams used as a weapon, however the referee did not disqualify anyone for the usage. AMW earned a near-fall after a bearhug and a lariat combination on Ray. Team 3D followed with their own near-fall on Harris, after they performed their signature Deadly Device maneuver on Storm. After this, Kim interfered trying to blow powder into Ray's eyes, only for Ray to stop her and <b>blow</b> <b>it</b> back into her and the referee's eyes. With the referee blinded, Team 3D performed their signature 3D maneuver on Harris and the referee counted the pin. Team Canada then attacked 3D, knocking out Ray in the process with a hockey stick. They placed Harris on top of Ray and left the ring. After the referee regained his vision, he declared AMW the victors at 12 minutes and 41 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} an unknown person {{lighting}} a candle in the homicide squadroom. One by one, the detectives arrive for the night shift on an unusually hot September evening. A furious Gee (Yaphet Kotto) calls maintenance {{to complain about the}} non-working air conditioner and learns it has been shut off for the night. Felton (Daniel Baldwin) and Lewis (Clark Johnson) try to find out who secretly lights the candle every night; they <b>blow</b> <b>it</b> out a number of times, but it always ends up lit again without anyone noticing. Munch (Richard Belzer) loudly complains about his ex-girlfriend breaking up with him. While the other detectives sweat and complain about the heat, a calm and comfortable Pembleton (Andre Braugher) wears a tie and drinks hot tea without sweating. Bayliss (Kyle Secor), who acts uncooperative with his partner Pembleton, says he has found the fingerprints of a man named James Hill who he believes is the murderer in the Adena Watson case. Officer Thormann (Lee Tergesen) brings in Hill, who {{turns out to be a}} 12-year-old boy (Kenny Blank), much to the amusement of the other detectives.|$|E

25|$|The French {{troops who}} {{occupied}} Moscow in 1812 used {{the church for}} stables and looted anything worth taking. The church was spared by the Fire of Moscow (1812) that razed Kitai-gorod, and by the troops' failure to <b>blow</b> <b>it</b> up according to Napoleon's order. The interiors were repaired in 1813, and the exterior in 1816. Instead of replacing missing ceramic tiles of the main tent, the Church preferred to simply cover it with a tin roof.|$|E
25|$|On 10 April, the {{remaining}} mutineers fired on Valletta, though they caused no injury. Villettes then ordered that the fort be stormed. A party of 40 men under Lieutenant de Clermont, who was himself {{part of the}} Froberg Regiment, scaled the fort and took control of it, taking no losses in the process. The fort fell but six rebels retreated into the gunpowder magazine, threatening to <b>blow</b> <b>it</b> up. After two days, they blew up the magazine's 600 barrels of gunpowder, and killed three British sentries. In the ensuing confusion the six rebels managed to escape to the countryside.|$|E
25|$|At Riqueval {{they got}} {{an even bigger}} prize: the Germans had left the {{concrete}} bridge standing as the main supply route for their troops on the western bank. The bridge had been prepared for demolition, but the Germans considered the sector impregnable. A company of 6th North Staffs was detailed to rush the bridge before the Germans could <b>blow</b> <b>it.</b> Captain A.H. Charlton and nine men dashed out of the fog, bayoneted the machine-gunners guarding the west end, and ran across the bridge in a race with the demolition party emerging from a bunker at the east end (where a memorial erected by the Western Front Association now stands). The Staffords won the race, shooting the Germans and cutting the leads to the demolition charges.|$|E
50|$|On 21 December 1812, the 38-gun frigate , Captain Bridges Watkinson Taylor commanding, {{accompanied}} by the brig-sloop , chased a trabaccoló {{under the protection of}} the tower of San Cataldo, on the coast between Brindisi and Otranto. The boats of the two vessels captured the tower and <b>blew</b> <b>it</b> up.

25|$|A {{platoon of}} five M26s, less {{one that was}} being serviced, {{played a key role}} in helping Combat Command B of the 9th Armored capture the Ludendorff Bridge during the Battle of Remagen on March 7–8, 1945, {{providing}} fire support to the infantry in order to take the bridgehead before the Germans could <b>blow</b> <b>it</b> up. In encounters with Tigers and Panthers, the M26 performed well. Some of the division's other tanks were able to cross the bridge, but the T26E3s were too large and heavy to cross the damaged bridge and had to wait five days before getting across the river by barge. Europe's bridges were in general not designed for heavy loads, which had been one of the original objections to sending a heavy tank to Europe.|$|E
25|$|Butler also {{planned to}} bring the USS Louisiana, which had been packed with 200 tons of powder and {{disguised}} as a blockade runner, down to Fort Fisher, run it aground about a {{hundred yards from the}} fort's seawall, and <b>blow</b> <b>it</b> up, hoping the explosion would demolish the fort as well. Although many in the Union high command (including Grant and Gideon Wells) doubted the plan would work, it was approved by Lincoln. The final Union plan was for the ships to gather at Hampton Roads, where the army troops would board the transports. Because the monitors used in the attack had to be towed to Fort Fisher, the navy would leave with a twelve-hour head start over the transports. The warships would refuel at Beaufort, then meet the transports at Fort Fisher, when the Louisiana would be detonated and the troops landed under the fire of the warships.|$|E
25|$|Roberts {{made her}} acting debut at age nine in Ted Demme's 2001 drama film <b>Blow.</b> <b>It</b> {{was the first}} film for which she ever auditioned. In the film, she portrayed Kristina Jung, the {{daughter}} of Johnny Depp's character (cocaine smuggler George Jung). That year, {{she also had a}} role in Leif Tilden's 10-minute short bigLove, and was an uncredited extra in some scenes featuring her aunt Julia Roberts in America's Sweethearts. Roberts went on to appear in smaller roles in two family films: in 2002's Grand Champion, as the sister of the main character Buddy (Jacob Fisher); and in 2006's Spymate, as the kidnapped daughter of former secret agent Mike Muggins (Chris Potter), who tries to rescue her {{with the help of a}} spy monkey. Grand Champion had a brief theatrical release in August 2004, while Spymate was not released until February 2006, when it was given a theatrical run in Canada, followed by its DVD release in April 2006.|$|E
