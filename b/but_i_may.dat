2500|$|She {{was very}} well liked, and {{afterword}} went to Florence, where the celebrated soprano singer, Marchesi, [...] was engaged at the Pergola theatre. He was then in his prime, and attracted not only all Florence, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> say all Tuscany. Storace was engaged to sing second woman in his operas; and to the following circumstance, well known all over the Continent, did she owe her sudden elevation in her profession. Bianchi had composed the celebrated cavatina Semianza amabile del mio bel sole, which Marchesi sung with the most ravishing taste; in one passage he ran up a voletta of semitone octaves, the last of which he gave with such exquisite power and strength, that it was ever after called La Bomba di Marchesi! Immediately after this song, Storace had to sing one, and was determined to bring a bomba into the field also. She attempted it, and executed it, to the admiration and astonishment of the audience, but {{to the dismay of}} poor Marchesi. Campigli, the manager, requested her to discontinue it, but she peremptorily refused, saying that she had as good a right to shew the power of her bomba as any body else. The contention was brought to a close by Marchesi's declaring that if she did not leave the company, he would; and unjust as it was, the manager was obliged to dismiss her, and engage another lady, who was not so ambitious of exhibiting a bomba.|$|E
