Cherry's decision to advance the storylines by six months for the third season premiere came {{as a response to}} the series' problematic second season. Cherry stated that he regretted most of the second season, as scheduling problems made it difficult to plan the season's storylines. [...] "One of the problems I had with Season 2 was that I had to keep going with the previous year's stuff," [...] he explained. [...] "I learned you have to go back to square one to build up the tension again." [...] The cast also expressed disappointment in the second season; James Denton considered leaving the show and Marcia Cross confessed: [...] "I've been at Marc's door plenty of times [...] going, 'You've got to be kidding.'" [...] Cherry stated that the six-month time jump would help the storylines develop quicker, as the second season's storylines lagged.

VanDerWerff wrote that Blaine [...] "seems to have simultaneously gotten younger and had a complete personality transplant over the summer", Billboard Rae Votta noted [...] "the continuity-bending plot point that he's somehow a Junior and not a Senior like his boyfriend", and Samantha Urban of The Dallas Morning News allowed her exasperation to show: [...] "Oh really, Glee?

60|$|He {{looks at}} me as if I were an imposter. Yet it is true. I find it quite easy to {{understand}} Sardinian. As a matter of fact, it is more a question of human approach than of sound. Sardinian seems open and manly and downright. Sicilian is gluey and evasive, as if the Sicilian didn't want to speak straight to you. As a matter of fact, he doesn't. He is an over-cultured, sensitive, ancient soul, and he has so many sides to his mind that he hasn't got any definite one mind at all. He's got a dozen minds, and uneasily he's aware of it, and to commit himself to anyone of them is merely playing a trick on himself and his interlocutor. The Sardinian, on the other hand, still seems to have one downright mind. I <b>bump</b> <b>up</b> against a downright, smack-out belief in Socialism, for example. The Sicilian is much too old in our culture to swallow Socialism whole: much too ancient and rusé not to be sophisticated about any and every belief. He'll go off like a squib: and then he'll smoulder acridly and sceptically even against his own fire. One sympathizes with him in retrospect. But in daily life it is unbearable.|$|E
