50|$|Both {{agents are}} {{administered}} by spinal tap (lumbar puncture - LP or cisternal puncture at the cervicocranial junction). The human patient is rolled from the lateral decubitus (lying on the side) to prone. Ankles are {{strapped to the}} end of a hard X-ray, CT, or MRI table. To obtain images of the cervical region the patient is then carefully tilted cephalad (toward the head) so contrast agent (particularly Pantopaque) can enter the neck region. Care is given to prevent spilling dye into the posterior fossa (back of the head) or to enter the cranial cavity in general. This speaks to the inability to remove the heavier or more viscous Pantopaque without aspirating it with spinal fluid (CSF) through a lumbar puncture needle in the low back (sticking up vertically) or back of the neck. With Metrizamide the issue is that if entering the cranial cavity and high dose exposure to the blood brain <b>barrier,</b> <b>side</b> effects are more likely encountered. Issues related to absorption into the general circulation are also encountered.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{present the results}} of an {{experimental}} study concerning different contact deposition processes on Semi-Insulating (S. I.) GaAs detectors aiming to study and optimize their performance in terms of leakage current, break-down voltage, charge collection efficiency and energy resolution when irradiated with 60 KeV photons; in particular the effect of the mesa etching treatment on the Schottky <b>barrier</b> <b>side</b> of the detectors has been studied. Such treatment certainly improves the detector performances related to the very important issue of the electric field uniformity. Detectors with satisfactory features in view of their possible application to Digital Radiography have been obtained. RI Cola, Adriano/G- 2379 - 201...|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{occupant}} injury severity in side pole impact, this paper conducted a computer simulation {{study on the}} side pole impact of a passenger car. The injury criterion and parameters of dummy, the side structure deformation and acceleration of the car body were thoroughly analyzed {{in terms of the}} crash characteristics of the car in side pole impact. The countermeasures for improving the strength of the door-sill-beam and the floor cross member were presented. Simulation results have shown that the side pole impact increases occupant injury risk and makes more intrusion on the side structure of the body, compared with car to <b>barrier</b> <b>side</b> impact. The passenger car safety performance can be improved in side pole impact by strengthening the door-sill-beam and the floor cross member...|$|E

40|$|The marine tropics contain {{five major}} biogeographic regions (East Pacific, Atlantic, Indian Ocean, Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA) and Central Pacific). These regions are {{separated}} by both hard and soft barriers. Reconstructing ancestral vicariance, we evaluate the extent of temporal concordance in vicariance events across three major barriers (Terminal Tethyan Event (TTE), Isthmus of Panama (IOP), East Pacific Barrier, EPB) and two incomplete <b>barriers</b> (either <b>side</b> of the IAA) for the Labridae, Pomacentridae and Chaetodontidae. We found a marked lack of temporal congruence within and among the three fish families in vicariance events associated with the EPB, TTE and IOP. Vicariance across hard barriers separating the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific (TTE, IOP) is temporally diffuse, with many vicariance events preceding barrier formation. In marked contrast, soft <b>barriers</b> either <b>side</b> of the IAA hotspot support tightly concordant vicariance events (2. 5 Myr on Indian Ocean side; 6 Myr on Central Pacific side). Temporal concordance in vicariance points to large-scale temporally restricted gene flow during the Late Miocene and Pliocene. Despite different and often complex histories, both hard and soft barriers have comparably strong effects {{on the evolution of}} coral reef taxa...|$|R
40|$|Human {{cerebral}} microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D 3 cell line) form {{a steady}} polarized barrier when cultured in vitro on a permeable membrane. Their susceptibility to enterovirus (EV) strains was analysed to investigate how these viruses may cross the blood-brain barrier. A sample of 88 virus strains was selected on phylogenetic features among 44 epidemiologically relevant types {{of the four}} EV species A-D. The EV-A 71 genome was replicated at substantial rates while the infectious virus was released at extremely low but sustained rates at both <b>barrier</b> <b>sides</b> for at least 4 days. EV-A 71 antigens were detected in {{a limited number of}} cells. The properties of the endothelial barrier (structure and permeability) remained intact throughout infection. The chronic EV-A 71 infection was in sharp contrast with the productive infection of cytolytic EVs (e. g. echoviruses 6 and 30). The hCMEC/D 3 barriers infected with the latter EVs exhibited elevated proportions of apoptotic and necrotic cells, which resulted in major injuries to the endothelial barriers with dramatic increase of paracellular permeability and virus crossing to the abluminal side. The following intracellular rearrangements were also seen: early destruction of the actin cytoskeleton, remodelling of intracellular membranes, and reorganization of the mitochondrion network in a small cluster near the perinuclear space...|$|R

40|$|Maternal health can {{be defined}} as the health of women during pregnancy, {{childbirth}} and the postpartum period. Of all the maternal deaths in the world, 99 % occurs in developing countries. The highest maternal mortality ratios can be witnessed in India where approximately 20 % of all maternal deaths take place. The majority of these deaths occur due to preventable causes. Unfortunately, many women are excluded from the health care system that is present in their country. This problem is strongly prevalent amongst Indian women from low socioeconomic groups, resulting in low or incomplete uptake of maternal health care. The barriers that woman come across when wanting to access and utilize health care can be categorized under five dimensions namely, Availability, Accessibility, Affordability, Adequacy and Acceptability. These dimensions consist out of barriers that can be described as supply <b>side</b> <b>barriers</b> and demand <b>side</b> <b>barriers.</b> This baseline study aims to provide an insight to the accessibility and utilization of maternal health care in a North-Indian city. The main goal of this thesis is the present and discuss the degree in which maternal health care is utilized in medical facilities, the barriers that women come across when accessing this type of care and how women’s experiences with accessing and utilizing maternal health care can influence their expected future behavior. In order to get a better understanding of these topics, research has been conducted in Lucknow, the capital city of the Northern Indian state Uttar Pradesh. Fifty women from the urban slum Kashyap Nagar have participated in this study by sharing their experiences on accessing and utilizing maternal health care during their last pregnancy. The data collection focused on the demand side perspective e. g. that of the women from Kashyap Nagar...|$|R
