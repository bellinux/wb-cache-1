5|$|Both {{the coma}} and tail are {{illuminated}} by the Sun and may become visible when a comet passes through the inner Solar System, the dust reflects Sunlight directly while the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> {{without the aid of}} a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> to the naked eye. Occasionally a comet may experience a huge and sudden outburst of gas and dust, during which the size of the coma greatly increases for a period of time. This happened in 2007 to Comet Holmes.|$|E
5|$|In November 1943 some {{plutonium}} trifluoride {{was reduced}} to create the first sample of plutonium metal: a few micrograms of metallic beads. Enough plutonium was produced {{to make it the}} first synthetically made element to <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> with the unaided eye.|$|E
5|$|Makemake is {{currently}} visually the second-brightest Kuiper belt object after Pluto, having a March opposition apparent magnitude of 17.0 {{in the constellation}} Coma Berenices. This is bright enough to <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> using a high-end amateur telescope.|$|E

5|$|Campbell's Soup Company {{sponsored}} the entire nineteen-year run of Lassie. In {{one of the}} first instances of product placement, the company asked that their products <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> on the set and so, in episode after episode, Campbell's products are seen in background shots. Campbell's also contractually required the show's stars to avoid appearing in any film or theatrical production that undermined their All-American images.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{observed}} the Milky Way, previously {{believed to be}} nebulous, and {{found it to be}} a multitude of stars packed so densely that they appeared from Earth to be clouds. He located many other stars too distant to <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> with the naked eye. He {{observed the}} double star Mizar in Ursa Major in 1617.|$|E

5|$|In 1627, Johannes Kepler {{became the}} first person to predict a transit of Venus, by {{predicting}} the 1631 event. His methods were not sufficiently accurate to predict that the transit would not <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> in most of Europe, and as a consequence, nobody was able to use his prediction to observe the phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{alterations}} are {{visible to the}} naked eye as pentimenti. A piece of paper draped over the edge of the table is clearly visible in outline, despite having been painted over with detailing of the table itself. Sigismunda's index finger which was bent towards and perhaps touching the heart has been straightened, but the outline of the tip is still visible on the surface of the heart. A looped cord in the top right-hand corner is poorly concealed under the topmost layer of paint. It is also known that, to attempt to appease critics, Hogarth repainted the fingers of Sigismunda so that the blood that was previously there would no longer <b>be</b> <b>visible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Kepler's {{calculations}} {{indicated that}} the 1631 transit of Venus would best <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> from the American continent, he was not fully confident of his prediction, and advised that European astronomers {{should be prepared to}} observe the event. Gassendi and others in Europe watched for it but, as predicted, the Sun was below the horizon during the transit. According to modern calculations, observers in much of Italy and along the eastern Mediterranean {{should have been able to}} view the last stage of the transit, but no such observations were recorded. Kepler had predicted a near miss for a Venus transit in 1639 and, as the next full transit was not expected for another 121years, Gassendi and the other astronomers concentrated their efforts in other areas.|$|E

5|$|Dermide {{was born}} on 20 April 1798, in Milan, which was then part of the Cisalpine Republic, a puppet state of the First French Republic. He {{was the first and}} only child of his parents, Maria Paola di Buonaparte (known as Pauline) and Charles Victoire Emmanuel Leclerc, a general in the French Army. Dermide's birth was a {{difficult}} one, and its effects would <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> in Pauline's health for many years. He was christened Dermide Louis Napoléon, after a character in the epic Gaelic poems of Ossian, at the request of his uncle, general Napoleon Bonaparte, who greatly admired Ossian's works.|$|E
5|$|Eyes: Kayser–Fleischer rings (KF rings), a {{pathognomonic}} sign, may <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> in {{the cornea}} of the eyes, {{either directly or}} on slit lamp examination as deposits of copper in a ring around the cornea. They are due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane. They do not occur in all people with Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts exhibited by brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Neither cause significant visual loss. KF rings occur in approximately 66% of diagnosed cases (more often in those with neurological symptoms rather than with liver problems).|$|E
5|$|Further {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} the Kuiper belt later emerged from the study of comets. That comets have finite lifespans has been known for some time. As they approach the Sun, its heat causes their volatile surfaces to sublimate into space, gradually dispersing them. In order for comets to continue to <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> over the age of the Solar System, they must be replenished frequently. One such area of replenishment is the Oort cloud, a spherical swarm of comets extending beyond 50,000 AU from the Sun first hypothesised by Dutch astronomer Jan Oort in 1950. The Oort cloud is thought to be the point of origin of long-period comets, which are those, like Hale–Bopp, with orbits lasting thousands of years.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, the Armour Research Foundation (ARF), {{based at}} the Illinois Institute of Technology, began {{studying}} the effects of nuclear explosions on the environment. These studies continued until 1962. In May 1958, ARF began covertly researching the potential consequences of an atomic explosion on the Moon. The main objective of the program, which ran {{under the auspices of}} the United States Air Force, which had initially proposed it, was to cause a nuclear explosion that would <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> from Earth. It was hoped that such a display would boost the morale of the American people.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Vesta reached {{opposition}} in the constellation of Leo {{on the night of}} 17–18 February, at about magnitude 6.1, a brightness that makes it visible in binocular range but generally not for the naked eye. Under perfect dark sky conditions where all light pollution is absent it might <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> to an experienced observer without the use of a telescope or binoculars. Vesta came to opposition again on 5 August 2011, in the constellation of Capricornus at about magnitude 5.6.|$|E
5|$|It is safe {{to observe}} the total phase of a solar eclipse {{directly}} only when the Sun's photosphere is completely covered by the Moon, and not before or after totality. During this period, the Sun is too dim to be seen through filters. The Sun's faint corona will <b>be</b> <b>visible,</b> and the chromosphere, solar prominences, and possibly even a solar flare may be seen. At the end of totality, the same effects will occur in reverse order, and {{on the opposite side}} of the Moon.|$|E

5|$|Like all animal heads, {{the head}} of a {{butterfly}} or moth contains the feeding organs and the major sense organs. The head typically consists of two antennae, two compound eyes, two palpi and a proboscis. Lepidoptera have ocelli {{which may or may not}} <b>be</b> <b>visible.</b> They also have sensory structures called chaetosemata, the functions of which are largely unknown. The head is filled largely by the brain, the sucking pump and its associated muscle bundles. Unlike the adults, the larvae have one-segmented mandibles.|$|E
5|$|Male {{and female}} guinea pigs {{do not differ}} in {{external}} appearance apart from general size. The position of the anus {{is very close to}} the genitals in both sexes. Female genitals are distinguished by a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vulvar flap, while the male genitals may look similar, with the penis and anus forming a like shape, the penis will protrude if pressure is applied to the surrounding hair. The male's testes may also <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> externally from scrotal swelling.|$|E
5|$|Many reticle {{illumination}} {{and pattern}} options are available. Common light sources used in firearm reflector sights include battery powered lights, fiber optic light collectors, and even tritium capsules. Some sights {{are specifically designed}} to <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> when viewed through night vision devices. The color of a sight reticle is often red or amber for visibility against most backgrounds. Some sights use a chevron or triangular pattern instead, to aid precision aiming and range estimation, and still others provide selectable patterns.|$|E
