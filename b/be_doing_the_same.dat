Installation of flower beds was delayed due to garbage being dumped on the median by garbage collectors, BMRC will {{also set up}} flower beds on Reach 1 with assistance from the horticulture department.

BMRC will rejuvenate Kengeri and Veerasandra lakes using water collected from a nearby corridor.|$|E

Towards the end of the season, it was speculated that the Canucks would buyout the final year of Burrows' contract in favour of playing a younger player. In March 2016, he was reportedly told by Canucks coaching staff that [...] "younger players were a roster priority". However in the ensuing off-season, the Canucks instead bought out the contract of teammate Chris Higgins and stated they would not <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> to Burrows.|$|E

My 'confession' follows and takes place on a Crucifix that I ultimately come down from. This is not a mocking of the church. It is no different than a person wearing a Cross or 'Taking Up the Cross' as it says in the Bible. My performance is neither anti-Christian, sacrilegious or blasphemous.

500|$|Despite the {{apparent}} agreement, the Hobbs Company continued to interpose objections. Engraver Barber was {{asked for his}} view; he stated that Reith, who had attended the trial striking, had been given {{all the time and}} facilities he had asked for in testing the new pieces, and the mechanic had pronounced himself satisfied. [...] Hobbs Company agent C. U. Carpenter suggested that Reith had been intimidated by the preparations that had already gone into the issue of the modified nickel, [...] "and, instead of pointing out clearly just what the situation demanded, agreed to adapt our device to the coin more readily that [...] he was warranted in doing". [...] On February 3, Hobbs sent Roberts a lengthy list of changes that he wanted in the coin, and the sculptor was required to attend a conference with Hobbs and Reith. [...] On the fifth, following the conference, which ended with no agreement, Fraser sent MacVeagh a ten-page letter, complaining that his time was being wasted by the Hobbs Company, and appealing to the Secretary to bring the situation to a close. [...] MacVeagh agreed to hold a meeting at his office in Washington on February 14. When the Hobbs Company requested permission to bring a lawyer, Fraser announced he would <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> The Hobbs Company sought letters of support from the business community, with little success; Fraser's efforts to secure support from artists for his position were more fruitful. [...] Barber prepared patterns showing what the nickel would look like if the changes demanded by Hobbs were made. MacVeagh conducted the meeting much like a legal hearing, and issued a letter the following day.|$|E

Meanwhile, it is revealed that Puffer has been investigating Drood's disappearance, but has also noticed a rather seedy looking figure who seems to <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> It turns out that this man (played by the same actor who plays Drood, normally), Dick Datchery, is a private investigator.

The cast appears and summarizes the situation, warning the audience, [...] "don't fall back on your assumptions, hasty presumptions might do you in!", telling them to think carefully of who they will vote for as the murderer, in the song [...] "Don't Quit While You're Ahead". As the song climbs to a climax, the actors trail off, and the Chairman announces to the audience that it was at this place that Charles Dickens laid down his pen forever. [...] However, they, with the audience's help, will resolve the story and the public voting begins as to who Datchery and The Murderer are; unfortunately, the actress playing Drood and, up to that point, Datchery is not chosen as Datchery and exits the theater in a huff. [...] Once the votes have been tabulated, the cast come out and sing [...] "Don't Quit While You're Ahead" [...] to welcome the audience back into the story and to remind them that the mystery has not been solved.|$|E

It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b>|$|E

The upper flags are now used as a footpath, and [...] lead by another passage back into the village. No doubt the garden has [...] been reduced in size, by the use of that part of it fronting the lane [...] for building purposes.
