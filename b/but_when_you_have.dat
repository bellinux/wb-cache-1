500|$|After {{the success}} of Dallas, Jacobs' {{presented}} his initial idea again and created Knots Landing, with some alterations of his original script. In an interview, Jacobs explained: [...] " [...] Well, that's pretty good, but you know-and then {{he pulled out the}} pages that we'd left for them a few years ago on Knots Landing, or a year before on Knots, and he said, 'Is there any way we can make this a spin-off?' [...] I just took one of the couples and made it, you know, Val and Gary who had already been created on the parent series and putting them into the mix, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> four couples and you change one, you sort of have to change the dynamic all the way around. However, once I wrote the script, remarkably little changed from the script and the pilot as you would see it." [...] Gary Ewing was originally played by actor David Ackroyd, but Ackroyd was unable to sign on for the spin-off, and Ted Shackelford assumed the role. Initially, it was presumed that Charlene Tilton would be joining Knots Landing as Gary and Val's daughter, but the network decided to keep her on Dallas {{in order to keep the}} two shows separate. She did, however, make a guest appearance in the first season.|$|E
2500|$|They {{were named}} one of the Huffington Posts Sweet 16 of 2016 by {{entertainment}} and sports journalist Michael Blalas on December 21, 2016. Blalas stated of the band, [...] "Ah, the beauty of youthful exuberance. It's a wonderful thing, to be sure, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> brains, musical talent, enthusiasm and the ability to connect with a growing fan base through the monster method of social media and viral videos, there's no telling how far you can go," [...] and that [...] "The Accidentals certainly didn't happen by accident." ...|$|E
2500|$|They {{began working}} more quickly on {{material}} then they ever had. [...] "We write songs in like five minutes now," [...] Maida {{said at the}} time, [...] "The energy's there." [...] For the first time, Mazur {{was included in the}} songwriting process, having not been in the band yet while Gravity was being written. [...] "On this record we really tried to write together," [...] Maida says. [...] "It’s easy for me to come in with a song, say here it is, lets go record it and it’ll be done in a couple of days. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to sit in your rehearsal hall and you wait for that magic to happen, well, it doesn’t always happen right away, but that was the M.O. for this record and it worked." ...|$|E

"Go {{to dress}} {{or you will}} be late for dinner," [...] he said still rather sternly, and <b>you</b> went. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> gone and after we had been {{announced}} to him, he smiled and added something which I will not repeat to you even now. I think it was about what you did on the Annexation day of which the story had come to him.|$|R

And you would feel, if you yourself were thoughtful and contemplative, and much given to study a lady's eyes, that, such as they were, every lady would possess the like if only it were given to her to choose.|$|R
2500|$|After {{losing his}} {{re-election}} bid for Mayor to George Voinovich in 1979, Kucinich initially kept {{a low profile}} in Cleveland politics. He criticized a tax referendum proposed by Voinovich in 1980, which voters eventually approved. He also struggled to find employment and moved to Los Angeles, California, where he stayed with a friend, actress Shirley MacLaine. During the next three years, Kucinich worked as a radio talk-show host, lecturer, and consultant. It was a difficult period for Kucinich financially. Without a steady paycheck, Kucinich fell behind in his mortgage payments, nearly lost his house in Cleveland, and ended up borrowing money from friends, including MacLaine, to keep it. On his 1982 income tax return, Kucinich reported an income of $38. When discussing this period, Kucinich stated, [...] "When I {{was growing up in}} Cleveland, my early experience conditioned me to hang in there and not to quit... It's one thing to experience that as a child, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to as an adult, it has a way to remind you how difficult things can be. You understand what people go through." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Rosenqvist said the result had been awaiting Mahindra {{for a long period}} of time and felt as if his team could win many races over the course of the season and the first Berlin race was an event that saw [...] "all the puzzle pieces came together." [...] He added that despite small errors, he was still able to secure the victory: [...] "We work so hard and you can really see the suffering sometimes <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> days like this it's all worth it." [...] Di Grassi stated that his car was not satisfactory and that his team started the day [...] "very lost" [...] and made car set-up alterations: [...] "If you look at the pure pace from the morning - this was not the best race for us, so I tried to hang on as much as I could." [...] He revealed he lost regeneration from his overheating battery at the end of his first stint which persisted in his second stint. However di Grassi affirmed his team would improve his car and challenge for the victory in the following day's race. Third-place finisher Heidfeld said Mahindra's achievement of strong finish was [...] "a really outstanding result" [...] and stated he struggled in the first car but could mount a challenge to di Grassi in his second vehicle.|$|E

6000|$|... "I used to {{be awfully}} frightened," [...] laughed Herbertson. [...] "Now you say, Lilly, you'd never have stood it. But you would.

60|$|Upon my word, if I may say {{so without}} offence, I really think {{many forms of}} Pantheistic Atheism more {{agreeable}} to an imaginative mind than Unitarianism as it is professed in terms: in particular, I prefer the Spinosistic scheme infinitely. The early Socinians were, to be sure, most unaccountable logicians; <b>but,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> swallowed their bad reasoning, you came to a doctrine on which the heart, at least, might rest for some support. They adored Jesus Christ. Both Laelius and Faustus Socinus laid down the adorability of Jesus in strong terms. I <b>have</b> nothing, <b>you</b> know, {{to do with their}} logic. But Unitarianism is, in effect, the worst of one kind of Atheism, joined to the worst of one kind of Calvinism, like two asses tied tail to tail. It has no covenant with God; and looks upon prayer as a sort of self-magnetizing--a getting of the body and temper into a certain status, desirable per se, but having no covenanted reference to the Being to whom the prayer is addressed.|$|R
