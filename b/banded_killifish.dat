5|$|Lake sturgeon, {{endangered}} in both Indiana and Illinois, {{as well as}} <b>banded</b> <b>killifish,</b> {{threatened in}} Illinois, are both part of the Wolf Lake ecology. The lake supports the nesting habitat for four species of endangered birds: little blue heron, yellow-crowned night heron, black-crowned night heron, and yellow-headed blackbird.|$|E
25|$|Over 80 {{species of}} fish {{have been found in}} Lake Superior. Species native to the lake include: <b>banded</b> <b>killifish,</b> bloater, brook trout, burbot, cisco, lake sturgeon, lake trout, lake whitefish, longnose sucker, muskellunge, {{northern}} pike, pumpkinseed, rock bass, round whitefish, smallmouth bass, walleye, white sucker and yellow perch. In addition, many fish species have been either intentionally or accidentally introduced to Lake Superior: Atlantic salmon, brown trout, carp, chinook salmon, coho salmon, freshwater drum, pink salmon, rainbow smelt, rainbow trout, round goby, ruffe, sea lamprey and white perch.|$|E
25|$|Planktonic copepods are {{important}} to global ecology and the carbon cycle. They are usually the dominant members of the zooplankton, and are major food organisms for small fish such as the dragonet, <b>banded</b> <b>killifish,</b> whales, seabirds, Alaska pollock, and other crustaceans such as krill in the ocean and in fresh water. Some scientists say they form the largest animal biomass on earth. Copepods compete for this title with Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). C. glacialis inhabits {{the edge of the}} Arctic icepack, especially in polynyas where light (and photosynthesis) is present, in which they alone comprise up to 80% of zooplankton biomass. They bloom as the ice recedes each spring. The ongoing large reductions in the annual minimum of recent years may force them to compete in the open ocean with the much less nourishing C. finmarchicus, which is spreading from the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea into the Barents Sea.|$|E
2500|$|Fish {{prefer to}} shoal with {{individuals}} {{with which the}} choosing fish is already familiar. This has been demonstrated in guppies, [...] threespine stickleback, <b>banded</b> <b>killifish,</b> [...] the surfperch Embiotoca jacksoni, Mexican tetra, and various minnows. [...] A study with the White Cloud Mountain minnow has also found that choosing fish prefer to shoal with individuals that have consumed the same diet as themselves.|$|E
2500|$|Larvae and pupae are {{important}} food items for fish, such as trout, <b>banded</b> <b>killifish,</b> and sticklebacks, {{and for many}} other aquatic organisms as well such as newts. Many aquatic insects, such as various predatory hemipterans in the families Nepidae, Notonectidae, and Corixidae eat Chironomidae in their aquatic phases. [...] So do predatory water beetles in families such as the Dytiscidae and Hydrophilidae. The flying midges are eaten by fish and insectivorous birds, such as swallows and martins. They also are preyed on by bats and flying predatory insects, such as Odonata and dance flies.|$|E
2500|$|The {{northern}} pike {{is a relatively}} aggressive species, especially with regards to feeding. For example, when food sources are sparse, cannibalism develops, starting around five weeks in {{a small percentage of}} populations. This cannibalism occurs when the ratio of predator to prey is two to one. One can expect this because when food is scarce, Northern pike fight for survival, such as turning on smaller pike to feed; this is seen in other species such as tiger salamanders. Usually, pike tend to feed on smaller fish, such as the <b>banded</b> <b>killifish.</b> However, when pike exceed [...] long, they feed on larger fish. As one can probably assume, these pike are the ones most likely to develop cannibalistic traits.|$|E
50|$|The mummichog is {{very similar}} to the <b>banded</b> <b>killifish,</b> Fundulus diaphanus, and indeed the two species have been known to interbreed. The two species may overlap in their choice of habitat, but in general the <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> is more {{commonly}} found in freshwater, which is not the case for the mummichog. The <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> tends to have thin dark bars on a light side, whereas in the mummichog the bars are thin and light on a dark side. Internally, the <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> has 4-7 gill rakers, as opposed to 8-12 in the mummichog.|$|E
50|$|<b>Banded</b> <b>killifish</b> {{have been}} found to engage in {{heterospecific}} shoaling with other species of killifish as well as other fish. There are many situational factors that determine if the <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> individual would want to engage in heterospecific shoaling. If body size is similar, then <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> prefer conspecific shoals as opposed to heterospecific ones. Size is a sorting mechanism for conspecific as opposed to heterospecific shoaling.|$|E
50|$|When {{choosing}} which shoals to join, <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> often {{choose to}} join ones that consist of others with similar phenotypes. In {{order to achieve}} this, <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> have shown the ability to discriminate between individuals within the species. <b>Banded</b> <b>killifish</b> distinguish individuals by body coloration phenotype. <b>Banded</b> <b>killifish</b> are likely to enter shoals with those of similar body color {{in order to maximize}} predator avoidance. An individual of different color might present as a contrast. This contrast is likely to make the shoal stand out and gain the predator's attention. Banded killifishes' level of preference for similarly colored shoalmates differs in the presence and absence of a predatory stimulus.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{subspecies}}, {{the eastern}} <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> Fundulus diaphanus diaphanus {{and the western}} <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> Fundulus diaphanus menona. The former is found in Atlantic drainages and the latter in the Great Lakes basin. Intergrades occur in the Saint Lawrence and Lake Erie drainages. The eastern subspecies is larger.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Closeup of a <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> to show {{anatomical}} features.|$|E
50|$|In the {{presence}} of a predatory stimulus, <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> decrease the amount of food attempts and duration of feeding posture. This is done to allocate more energy to predatory vigilance and avoidance. In both {{the presence}} and absence of predatory stimuli, <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> feeding rate for individuals is independent of shoal size. Lone individuals incur additional cost because they do not gain the improved predatory protection granted by shoal formation, and thus will attempt to join larger shoals rather than smaller shoals. When deciding whether to join a shoal or not, <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> value predatory protection over foraging opportunities.|$|E
50|$|To improve {{predator}} avoidance, <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> {{will often}} take refuge. Frightened {{fish in the}} presence of a predatory stimulus will hide in a foodless refuge. This preference is modulated by individual body size. Larger individuals spend more time in the refuge than their smaller conspecifics. Smaller <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> individuals are more prone to risk than their larger counterparts.|$|E
50|$|Adults {{range from}} 2 to 3 years in age. <b>Banded</b> <b>killifish</b> are {{schooling}} fish, usually traveling {{in groups of}} 3-6 individuals, while the juveniles travel in groups of 8-12. The fish are most often found in the shallow and quiet areas of clear lakes, ponds, rivers, and estuaries with sandy gravel or muddy bottoms and with abundant aquatic vegetation. The sand and gravel provides hatchlings and juveniles with places to hide when threatened by predatory fish such as the largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, northern pike Esox lucius, bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, and trout. Because the <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> is small, it generally does not venture into deeper waters, {{where it would be}} vulnerable to predation as well as unable to swim in the fast currents. However, adult <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> have been observed to travel into deep bodies of water to feed. <b>Banded</b> <b>killifish</b> often congregate near aquatic vegetation, as it provides protection as well as breeding habitat.|$|E
50|$|The average <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> {{ranges from}} 10 to 13 cm {{in length and}} weighs a few grams. The females tend to grow larger than the males. They also have darker bands on the sides. In contrast, the males have pale gray bands that are close together. The numbers of bands on the dorsal fin of a <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> is useful in {{determining}} the sex of this species.|$|E
50|$|Wolf Lake {{is home to}} the {{endangered}} Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) and the threatened <b>Banded</b> <b>killifish</b> (Fundulus diaphanus).|$|E
50|$|The {{nutritional}} state of <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> influences individual's decisions to shoal or not. Food-deprived individuals {{spent more time}} by themselves and not in shoals. When food-deprived individuals were found in shoals their shoals were not any smaller {{than that of a}} well-fed <b>banded</b> <b>killifish.</b> Hungry <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> are more likely to leave a shoal than a well-fed individual. In the presence of a food stimulus, group size decreases, so that each individual does not have to compete with others for access to these resources. When presented with food odour, individuals were less attracted to neighbors, but when presented with a predatory stimulus, they were more attracted to neighbors and formed tighter shoals. When in the presence of both stimuli, the group size is intermediate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Banded</b> <b>killifish</b> {{have been}} {{observed}} to feed {{at all levels of}} the water column. The adults feed on a variety of items such as insects, nymphs, mollusks, turbellarians, and other small crustaceans. Mosquito larvae are also a popular food source. In contrast, the smaller individuals are limited to fewer items such as chironomid larvae, cladocerans, copepods, and midge larvae. Both young and adult <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> {{have been observed}} to feed mostly in the afternoon.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> (Fundulus diaphanus) is a North American {{species of}} {{temperate}} freshwater killifish {{belonging to the}} Fundulus genus of the Fundulidae family. The natural geographic range extends from Newfoundland to South Carolina, and west to Minnesota. It includes the Great Lakes drainages. [...] The <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> is the only freshwater killifish found in the northeastern United States. While it is primarily a freshwater species, it can occasionally be found in brackish water.|$|E
50|$|The <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> {{is widely}} {{distributed}} throughout eastern North America, ranging from South Carolina to {{as far north}} as the Atlantic Provinces. They are also found {{in the eastern part of}} Montana to Minnesota and throughout the suitable habitats of the Great Lakes watershed of southern Ontario to Lake Superior. Due to biogeographical isolation and limitation of potential for range expansion, <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> species were assigned a status of special concern by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC).|$|E
50|$|<b>Banded</b> <b>killifish</b> are euryhaline, {{but they}} usually inhabit {{freshwater}} streams and lakes. The largest adult recorded, observed in Indian Bay, Canada, was 12.8 cm. People have used <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> as fish bait. Most {{people do not}} favor them as pets because they require {{a high level of}} maintenance and therefore do not survive well in an aquarium setting. They are important to aquatic ecosystems because they are a food source for larger fish such as largemouth bass, northern pike, and trout. They are also a food source for birds such as belted kingfisher (Megaceryle alcyon), common merganser (Mergus merganser), and herons.|$|E
50|$|Shoaling {{preferences}} in <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> differ in shoal species composition, shoal size, and individual body size within the shoal. The shift in preferences is triggered by predatory stimuli. In {{the presence of}} predatory stimuli, a <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> individual will prefer the bigger conspecific shoal, but {{only as long as}} the shoal is homogenous in individual fish size. If the size of individual fish were different, they would join a shoal of similarly sized fish regardless of shoal size. This preference is maintained by predatory threat. Body size is a more significant determinant of shoaling preference than shoal size and species composition.|$|E
50|$|The <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> has {{an olive}} {{color on the}} dorsal surface and white {{coloring}} on the ventral. The throat and fins are yellowish. There are vertical blackish and silver-white stripes along the sides.|$|E
50|$|Fish {{seen in the}} Waquoit Bay and its {{connecting}} waters include blueback herring, brook trout, rainbow trout, golden shiner, <b>banded</b> <b>killifish,</b> {{and northern}} pipefish. Arthropods present include the blue crab, hermit crab, and barnacles.|$|E
50|$|There are 16 {{species of}} fish present in the lake; {{some of them had}} been introduced. The lake {{supports}} a population of <b>banded</b> <b>killifish,</b> one of only a few known populations in the whole Grand River basin.|$|E
50|$|In January 2005 the <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> {{was listed}} as a {{vulnerable}} species under the Newfoundland Labrador Endangered Species Act and the Canada Species at Risk Act (SARA). This species is facing habitat degradation due to industrial development, motorized watercraft activities, and removal of aquatic vegetations.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to largemouth bass, the pond also contains pickerel, smallmouth bass, brook trout, black crappie, yellow perch, sunfishes such as pumpkinseed and bluegill, golden shiner, <b>banded</b> <b>killifish,</b> white perch, white sucker, and brown bullhead. A seasonal alewife run enters the pond from Plymouth Bay through Town Brook.|$|E
50|$|Lake sturgeon, {{endangered}} in both Indiana and Illinois, {{as well as}} <b>banded</b> <b>killifish,</b> {{threatened in}} Illinois, are both part of the Wolf Lake ecology. The lake supports the nesting habitat for four species of endangered birds: little blue heron, yellow-crowned night heron, black-crowned night heron, and yellow-headed blackbird.|$|E
50|$|<b>Banded</b> <b>killifish</b> use body {{coloration}} {{to determine}} if an individual has been parasitized or not. Black spots indicate {{the presence of a}} parasite, whereas the absence of these spots indicates an unparasitized individual. Both parasitized and unparasitized individuals preferred to join unparasitized shoals. The preference for unparasitized shoals increases with an increase in parasite load of a parasitized individual.|$|E
5000|$|Fish {{prefer to}} shoal with {{individuals}} {{with which the}} choosing fish is already familiar. This has been demonstrated in guppies, [...] threespine stickleback, <b>banded</b> <b>killifish,</b> [...] the surfperch Embiotoca jacksoni, Mexican tetra, and various minnows. [...] A study with the White Cloud Mountain minnow has also found that choosing fish prefer to shoal with individuals that have consumed the same diet as themselves.|$|E
50|$|<b>Banded</b> <b>killifish</b> are {{commonly}} observed to spawn in dense aquatic vegetation because they practice external fertilization where the female lays her eggs that {{are equipped with}} adhesive threads that adhere to plants. Spawning occurs from June to mid-August in shallow waters. During the spawning season, the males go through a color change phase. They develop a bright blue patch near the anal fin. In addition, the lower portion of the body changes to a bright blue color.|$|E
50|$|Some {{species of}} heron, {{such as the}} little egret and grey heron, have been {{documented}} using bait to lure prey to within striking distance. Herons may use items already in place, or actively add items to the water to attract fish such as the <b>banded</b> <b>killifish.</b> Items used may be man-made, such as bread; alternatively, striated herons in the Amazon have been watched repeatedly dropping seeds, insects, flowers, and leaves into the water to catch fish.|$|E
5000|$|Zec de la Rivière-York attracts [...] "saumeniers" [...] {{throughout}} America {{especially because}} of its mountain scenery {{and the size of}} salmon caught in it cold and clear waters. The York River, which is popular with salmon anglers, is segmented into eleven fishing quotas are seven. Typically, salmon pools are easily accessible along its entire length by the Highway 198. The York River has 6 species of fish, including the salmon, the brook trout, the American eel, the stickleback on <b>banded</b> <b>killifish</b> and smelt arc-en-ciel.|$|E
50|$|A single female may lay several {{clutches}} of eggs during one summer. After the eggs have been fertilized, both the parents will leave and go their separate ways; the eggs {{do not receive}} parental care. 6-7 millimeter fries emerge within 10 to 12 days depending on {{the temperature of the}} water. They reach maturity at approximately 1 year with an average length of 6 cm. <b>Banded</b> <b>killifish</b> can live for a little over 2 years. However, there have been some that have been observed to live up to 3 years.|$|E
