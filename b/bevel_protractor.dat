50|$|A <b>bevel</b> <b>protractor</b> is a {{graduated}} circular protractor {{with one}} pivoted arm used for measuring or marking off angles. Sometimes Vernier scales {{are attached to}} give more precise readings. It has wide application in architectural and mechanical drawing, although its use is decreasing with the availability of modern drawing software or CAD.|$|E

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis {{has been carried out}} in the following two areas of Optical metrology: 1. Measurement and correction of prism angles 2. Measurement of refractive indices using a spectrograph. The prism angles are conventionally tested by mechanical <b>bevel</b> <b>protractors,</b> autocol-limators (angle dekkors), simple interference techniques and interferometers. All these methods have their own limitations either in accuracy or in terms of cost. Mechanical methods are usually employed to measure the angles of prisms. Interference techniques and interferometers are also used but they need optically polished components. For both mechanical and simple interference methods of testing, it is essential to fabricate more than a single component in number. The process of building interferometers or purchasing interferometers, angle dekkors and standard angle gauges is not cost effective for many research laboratories, and medium scale industries. To overcome these difficulties simple and inexpensive methods without sacrificing the accuracy in the bargain are suggested for the measurement of prism angles, based on the principles of reflection of light. The refractive indices of prism materials for invisible and weaker spectral lines are usually determined from spectrograms using dispersion formulae and numerical interpolation techniques. In these methods, the accuracy of the results depends on the accuracy of determining the constants of the dispersion formulae. A simple experimental technique, using a spectrograph, is devised for the measurement of refractive indices of solids and liquids both for visible and invisible spectral lines (wavelengths). The thesis has been divided into six chapters. The first chapter starts with the general introduction. The second chapter presents the literature review of the existing methods for angle and refractive index measurements. The third chapter describes the proposed new techniques for prism angle measurements. The fourth chapter presents the experimental results of angle measurements, and the discussion of the accuracy of the results. This chapter also gives the scope for further research. The fifth chapter describes a newly proposed technique for measuring refractive indices and the experimental results. This chapter also gives the scope for further research. The summary of the results, conclusions, and suggestions for further work are presented in chapter six...|$|R
50|$|The <b>bevel</b> <b>protractor</b> Vernier scale {{may have}} {{graduations}} of 5′ (minutes) or 1/12°. Each {{space on the}} Vernier scale is 5′ less than two spaces on the main scale. Twenty four spaces on the Vernier scale equal in extreme length twenty three double degrees. Thus {{the difference between the}} space occupied by 2° on a main scale and the space of the Vernier scale is equal to one twenty-fourth of 2°, or 5′.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bevel</b> <b>protractor</b> {{is used to}} {{establish}} and test angles to very close tolerances. It reads to 5 minutes or 1/12° and can measure any angle from 0° to 360°. The <b>bevel</b> <b>protractor</b> consists of a beam, a graduated dial and a blade which is connected to a swivel plate (with Vernier scale) by thumb nut and clamp. When {{the edges of the}} beam and blade are parallel, a small mark on the swivel plate coincides with the zero line on the graduated dial. To measure an angle between the beam and the blade of 90° or less, the reading may be obtained direct from the graduation number on the dial indicated by the mark on the swivel plate. To measure an angle of over 90°, subtract the number of degrees as indicated on the dial from 180°, as the dial is graduated from opposite zero marks to 90° each way. Since the spaces, both on the main scale and the Vernier scale, are numbered both to the right and to the left from zero, any angle can be measured. The readings can be taken either to the right or to the left, according to the direction in which the zero on the main scale is moved.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} flux cored arc welding (FCAW) process parameters such as welding current, travel speed, voltage and CO 2 shielding gas flow rate on bead profile, bowing distortion and angular distortion of 409 M ferritic stainless steel sheets of 2 mm thickness. The bowing and angular distortions of the welded plates were measured using a simple device called profile tracer and Vernier <b>bevel</b> <b>protractor</b> respectively. The study revealed that the FCAW process parameters have significant effect on bead profile, and distortion. The relationship between bead profile and distortions were analyzed. Most favorable process parameters that give uniform bead profile and minimum distortion for the weld are recommended for fabrication...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} variations in the inclination of occlusal plane of casts mounted on Artex articulator using a facebow with a fixed value and customized nasion indicator. Materials and Methods: Twenty two subjects were selected for this investigation. Two maxillary impressions were made, and casts poured. For each of the twenty two subjects, the facebow records were made with, Artex face-bow using a fixed value nasion indicator and customized nasion indicator and mounted. The angle between the occlusal plane of upper cast and the upper articulator arm was measured with a Universal <b>bevel</b> <b>protractor</b> and compared with the gold standard cephalometric value. Results: It shows that, when angle was measured between maxillary occlusal plane and upper member of the articulator, on the mounted cast using a customized nasion indicator and fixed value nasion indicator against the gold standard cephalometric value as a whole, it {{was found to be}} not significant. But, if each patient were evaluated individually, there found to be the difference in the angle. Discussion and Conclusion: Variation in occlusal plane was very minimal and close to the cephalometric value when using customized nasion indicator compared to fixed value nasion indicator on the Artex...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: In {{complete}} denture wearers, {{the accumulation of}} food in the buccal vestibule {{is one of the}} factors causing discomfort to the patient. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of mandibular denture buccal flange on food retention and to correlate between varying angulations of buccal flange of mandibular denture on food retention. Materials and Methods: Complete dentures were fabricated and the mandibular {{complete denture}} was duplicated. The existing (unduplicated) manually molded and physiologically molded dentures were tested for food retention. Twenty test particles having a diameter of 2 &# 177; 0. 2 mm were placed on the middle part of the buccal flange and the subjects were instructed to expel the test particles by performing only functional movements of the buccal musculature. The numbers of residual test particles in the buccal vestibule were counted after 30 s. The angulations of the denture buccal flange (duplicated) were measured with an optical <b>bevel</b> <b>protractor</b> and trimmed to 50 &# 176; and the food retention test was performed. Similar tests were performed at 60 &# 176;, 70 &# 176; and 80 &# 176; angulations. The data were evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient, One-way ANOVA test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: The difference between the residual scores of manually molded and physiologically molded denture base was not significant. The difference between the residual scores at different angulations of the buccal flange of the denture was significant. Conclusion: Only the slope of the flange significantly affects the ability of subjects to expel the test particles...|$|E
