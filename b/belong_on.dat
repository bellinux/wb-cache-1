5|$|He {{earned a}} regular {{position}} with the Red Wings during the 1943–44 season, scoring 4 goals and 18 points. In the next two seasons he averaged 21 points while only being assessed an average of 8 penalty minutes and scored a career high 11 goals in 1945–46. The following season he earned his first post-season honour, when he was named a Second Team NHL All-Star. He was also named the Red Wings team MVP. He registered a career high 17 penalty minutes in 1947–48 and was named a First Team All-Star. The season also saw {{the start of a}} streak of 131 consecutive games where Quackenbush was not assessed a penalty. It began with the final 5 regular season and 10 playoff games that year, continued through the entire 60 regular season and 11 playoff games during the 1948–49 season, and ended after 45 games of the 1949–50 season. At the conclusion of the 1948–49 season, he was awarded the Lady Byng Trophy, the NHL's annual award for sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct. He was the first defenceman to win the award, and remains one of only three in NHL history to capture the trophy. Detroit General Manager Jack Adams detested the award and felt that any player who won it did not <b>belong</b> <b>on</b> his team, so he promptly traded Quackenbush. He was sent to the Boston Bruins with Pete Horeck for Pete Babando, Lloyd Durham, Clare Martin and Jimmy Peters, Sr.|$|E
25|$|Nimzowitsch's chess theories, {{when first}} propounded, flew {{in the face}} of widely held orthodoxies enunciated by the {{dominant}} theorist of the era, Siegbert Tarrasch, and his disciples. Tarrasch's rigid generalizations drew on the earlier work of Wilhelm Steinitz, and were upheld by Tarrasch's sharp tongue when dismissing the opinions of doubters. While the greatest players of the time, among them Alekhine, Emanuel Lasker and Capablanca, clearly did not allow their play to be hobbled by blind adherence to general concepts that the center had to be controlled by pawns, that development had to happen in support of this control, that rooks always <b>belong</b> <b>on</b> open files, that wing openings were unsound—core ideas of Tarrasch's chess philosophy as popularly understood—beginners were taught to think of these generalizations as unalterable principles.|$|E

[...] Ino, Sakura and Hinata place priority on love, treating it as more important than excelling as a ninja. [...] Fujimoto states that during the ninja examinations, Sakura's climactic fight with Ino, her love rival, is conducted on a purely physical level, contrasting this level of skill with the supernatural abilities displayed by her male classmates at this point. [...] When the medical ninja Tsunade is introduced, Sakura takes on a daughter-like role, learning to heal others from Tsunade teaching, which Fujimoto regards as reinforcing a conservative idea of women - that women do not <b>belong</b> <b>on</b> the battlefield as warriors, only as nurses.|$|E

500|$|Fujimoto {{argues that}} the story has overly {{traditional}} gender roles, noting [...] " [...] its representations suggest that men are {{men and women are}} women and that they differ naturally regarding aptitude and vocation". For example, the girls initially outperform the boys in the Ninja Academy, but [...] "once the boys get serious, the girls cannot keep pace". [...] Fujimoto points out that this does not upset Sakura, who is now surpassed by Naruto. [...] Character development based on female roles, when it does occur, again uses stereotypical roles: Tsunade, for example, a middle-aged woman with large breasts, is a clear mother figure, and when she teaches Sakura to be a medical ninja, which requires special skills possessed only by women, the story reinforces the idea that women only <b>belong</b> <b>on</b> the battlefield as healers. [...] Tsunade herself, who is a figure of authority in Naruto, is portrayed as ridiculous in a way that men in the same position are not. [...] Fujimoto suggests this presentation of women may explain why the female characters are often the most disliked characters among readers of the manga.|$|E

The song managed to chart at number 27 in the US and number 42 in the UK, and was the most electronically experimental composition by the group thus far. When {{it came time for}} The Electric Prunes to record songs for their first album, they were limited musically due to the predominate presence of Tucker and Mantz's (also Jill Jones) songwriting partnership, which composed the majority of the album's material. The group's debut album, The Electric Prunes possessed exotically-combined effects, and violin-like guitar riffs, mixed with a diverse, and somewhat uneven, selection of pop songs, with only [...] "Train For Tomorrow" [...] and [...] "Luvin'" [...] being penned by the band. Tracks such as the soft rock tune, [...] "Onie" [...] and [...] "Toonerville Trolley" [...] suggest inconsistency in an attempt to produce a commercially viable sound. Reflecting on the album, Tulin said, [...] "Consequently there are definitely songs that I believe do not <b>belong</b> <b>on</b> the album and were, in fact, a waste of our time and energy.

30|$|We {{thus have}} shown how {{different}} discourses around <b>belonging</b> <b>on</b> {{the national level}} still exclude similarly marginalized populations. Ethnic and religious minorities feel {{the consequences of this}} discourse on the city and the neighborhood levels. On the one hand, in predominantly white spaces, they are excluded as boundaries related to ethnic and religious background are more salient than boundaries related to class background. On the other hand, the makeup of neighborhoods can also mitigate against experiences of exclusion, particularly if they are ethnically diverse, as ethnic minorities develop feelings of belonging and their practices shape the neighborhood. This supports the findings of Crul et al. (2012) regarding the importance of the local integration context. We have demonstrated how this also applies to middle-class populations. As we focused on such dynamics and experiences within two global cities that are also capital cities, further research should examine how the dialectic between discourses around <b>belonging</b> <b>on</b> the national level and the experiences of <b>belonging</b> <b>on</b> the local level operates for middle-class ethnic second-generation populations in less populous or cosmopolitan environments.|$|R

2500|$|McKenzie's {{aversion to}} non-academic extra curricular {{activities}} reflected his philosophy of collegiate education. College {{was a time}} to study, {{not to engage in}} frivolous activities, and organizations and activities that promoted elitism among students did not <b>belong</b> <b>on</b> Fisk's campus. In 1915, Fisk officials debated the issue and agreed to ban [...] "fraternities and other secret or oath-bound societies" [...] because the trustees believed such organizations did not reflect the democratic ideals taught at the University and could lead to inappropriate student conduct. However, student organizations such as debating, literary and other academic societies were encouraged. McKenzie viewed religion as an important component of a Fisk education, and firmly rooted in the educational intent of its founders and the history of the school. Fisk's faculty and staff required that students conduct themselves according to Christian principles of character at all times. McKenzie linked the concepts of Christianity and sacrifice, suggesting that [...] "sacrifice is not an action nor a deprivation. It is a spiritual attitude." [...] In 1921, McKenzie published a small leaflet simply titled, the Fisk Creed. The leaflet, published partly as a response to persistent disciplinary problems, articulated Fisk's approach to education and student conduct. McKenzie hoped that Fisk students will [...] "prove that the Negro student can accept the grinding process of rigid training, and emerge to stand in even competition in the intellectual world." [...] McKenzie suggested that students not interested in abiding by Fisk's rules of conduct should look elsewhere. [...] "Those not content to live the simple and plain life owe it to other Fisk students to go elsewhere where larger expenditures are morally justifiable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vortex vice {{president}} Rick Giolito {{noted that there}} was [...] "pressure" [...] by their clients [...] "to incorporate Hollywood-type production, techniques, and corporate structure." [...] Interactive Publisher's Handbook agreed that Creative Wonders had streamlined its production process and produced partnerships and alliances between previously unrelated companies {{in a similar fashion}} to the [...] "'best practices' of Hollywood". Giolito asserted that publishers forced the company to create prototypes for pre-testing by focus groups before products would receive complete funding, investment, or a purchase commitment, which lead to shoe-horned Madeline prototypes that were made on a bootstrap budget. [...] Interactive Publisher's Handbook wrote that the developer was required to have a [...] "lean production" [...] in order to ensure success of the multi-company entity. EA required the developer to create technical design documents which would state the project milestones based on required technical aspects like game engines that need proof of concept, how long each element would take, the amount of human resources invested which then determined the shipping date; according to executive producer Michael Pole this was a favourable alternative to choosing a release date then working backwards and it helped developers stick to a timeline and understand which assets they were able to deliver. The publisher wanted the prototype stage to be preliminary deadline, with a trivial monitary investment that would identify any [...] "technical hurdles" [...] early on; this was followed by [...] "delivery of levels and game tuning" [...] by the developer. They would only back a project once [...] "one room of an environment that includes art and animation up and running, some collision detection and some gameplay" [...] was created, thereby demonstrating a viable investment; the preliminary artwork and prototype had to be completed within four months. The outsourcing of development to Vortex was a cost-cutting measure, as [...] "software publishers ha found that they mae more money distributing and selling software than developing it"; this led to a [...] "garage developer phenomenon" [...] where companies like Vortex made games like Madeline out of houses and basements. Madeline game artists worked double shifts, and shared computers, desks, and phone lines. In terms of marketing, EA would start devising strategy early on by discussing the chosen genre, and making sure the content and design fit the genre and were [...] "demographically correct"; for instance Pole asserted that [...] "Madeline doesn't <b>belong</b> <b>on</b> the Sony Playstation". In addition to Madaline already being a recognisable brand through its 60-year history, many national sales representatives in the interactive software industry had previously worked in the book and toy space, which meant that they were especially familiar with elements of the Madeline franchise. Madeline and the Magnificent Puppet Show, Madeline Thinking Games, and Madeline European Adventures were published by Creative Wonders in 1995–6, and Madeline would become Creative Wonders' [...] "flagship product". Interactive Publisher's Handbook believes that the marketing of the games would have been in vain if the games didn't live up to the expectations of Madeline branded content, and noted that its financial success paid off for DIC's original gamble, and that the critical praise of the premiere title coupled with ABC's desire to run children's programming led to the network picking up the second season of DIC's animated version of Madeline and airing it under the title The New Adventures of Madeline (the previous season and specials had aired on the Family Channel).|$|E
