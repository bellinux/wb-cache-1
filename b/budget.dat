40|$|<b>Budgeting</b> accomplishes many {{goals in}} an {{organization}} and evaluating {{the potential impact of}} a change is difficult.

40|$|Abstract The study aims {{to examine}} <b>budgeting</b> {{practices}} in Vietnam. It is motivated {{from the lack of}} research about <b>budgeting</b> practices in developing countries, particularly in Vietnam. Major patterns of <b>budgeting</b> such as its adoption and purposes are investigated. Furthermore, the extent to which variance analysis is used and its roles are also investigated. Another purpose of the study is to compare <b>budgeting</b> patterns between small and medium size companies and large ones, and to find possible association between firm size and <b>budgeting</b> practices. In order to reach those goals, a survey is carried out in Da Nang city, Vietnam. Overall, there are 71 respondents who are financial and non-financial managers, and knowledgeable about the <b>budgeting</b> process in companies. The study finds that most surveyed Vietnamese companies prepare <b>budgets,</b> especially traditional <b>budgets</b> such as annual <b>budgets</b> and operating <b>budgets.</b> On the contrary, “contemporary” <b>budgeting</b> practices such as flexible <b>budgets</b> are not adopted widely. Additionally, it is consistent with previous research that the <b>budgets</b> do serve various purposes in organizations, but planning and control roles of <b>budgeting</b> are more essential than evaluation role. Thirdly, variance analysis is not widely adopted in surveyed companies. For those who conduct variance analysis, control purpose are more focused than evaluation purpose. Last but not least, it is shown from the study that <b>budgeting</b> patterns in Vietnamese surveyed companies are quite similar in all firm sizes as only a few differences are found between SME and large company groups...|$|R

40|$|This thesis arose {{out of a}} {{previous}} study of <b>budgeting</b> practices carried out at a not-for-profit church. This initial study had found that relationships {{played an important role}} in <b>budgeting</b> practices. Interviewees carried out their budgetary tasks in a cooperative, sometimes sacrificial manner. This relationship-based approach to <b>budgeting</b> was inconsistent with conventional approaches to <b>budgeting.</b> It became apparent that <b>budgeting</b> practices in this church could be explained by social capital theory, and that <b>budgeting</b> could be viewed as a social phenomenon. I began to question whether considering <b>budgeting</b> as a social process might also apply to profit-orientated organisations. As part of this thesis, I approached two different for-profit organisations: an entertainment centre; and, a science testing laboratory. Along with the church examined previously, both of these organisations agreed to participate in this investigation into the social aspects of their <b>budgeting</b> processes. An interpretive methodology was adopted to study <b>budgeting</b> practices from the viewpoint of managers. Social capital was a sensitising theoretical perspective, and was viewed as a ‘skeletal theory’; in particular, I was drawn to a model of social capital proposed by Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998). Nahapiet and Ghoshal’s (1998) social capital framework was chosen as it was pertinent to examining the influence of social capital on the <b>budgeting</b> process. It came as a surprise to find that elements of Nahapiet and Ghoshal’s framework were in evidence in all three organisations. In the three case study organisations, <b>budgeting</b> was found to be a social process which can be explained by social capital theory. In contrast to the beyond <b>budgeting</b> proponents, who claim <b>budgeting</b> is redundant, this thesis has found that the <b>budgeting</b> process constitutes an investment of managers’ time and energy, because it encourages and promotes social capital. The <b>budgeting</b> process brought managers together to work cooperatively towards a commonly understood goal. <b>Budgeting</b> encouraged social interaction and fostered relationship building. Organisational norms and values were reinforced. Despite the differences between the three organisations, the common feature was that the <b>budgeting</b> process encouraged and reinforced social capital. This thesis has implications for other researchers. It provides a new insight into <b>budgeting.</b> It contributes to the qualitative <b>budgeting</b> literature by providing a contemporary view of the way social forces influence the <b>budgeting</b> process. It advances the literature on church <b>budgeting.</b> It adds to the social capital literature by adapting Nahapiet and Ghoshal’s (1998) framework of social capital to a context not previously studied – the <b>budgeting</b> process. There are implications for policymakers involved in setting budget-related policy in organisations, and for practitioners, as this thesis highlights the importance of the social side of the <b>budgeting</b> process...|$|R
