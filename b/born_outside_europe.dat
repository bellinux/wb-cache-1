40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} differences according to country of birth and parental country of birth, in relation to poor self-rated health (SRH), in Swedish adolescents. Methods: The Scania public health survey among children and adolescents, conducted in 2012, is a cross-sectional study including most pupils in grade 9 (15 years old), including in 32 of 33 municipalities. The participation rate was 83 % (9, 791 of 11, 735). We performed logistic regressions to investigate the association between the students' country of birth, parental country of birth and poor SRH. Results: Boys <b>born</b> <b>outside</b> <b>Europe</b> had an odds ratio (OR) 2. 1 (1. 6 - 2. 8) of poor SRH in the unadjusted model, which was reduced to 0. 7 (0. 4 - 1. 3) in the multiple model, as compared to boys born in Sweden with both or one parent born in Sweden. Boys born in Europe had an OR 0. 4 (0. 2 - 0. 9) of poor SRH, after multiple adjustments. Girls born in Sweden with both parents born abroad, and girls born outside of Europe had significantly lower ORs of poor SRH in the multiple model. In particular, adjustment for socio-demographic and psychosocial factors reduced the ORs of poor SRH among boys, but did so to a lesser extent among girls. Conclusions: Differences in socio-demographic and psychosocial factors explained the higher odds of poor SRH among boys born outside of Europe. Girls born in Sweden with both parents born abroad, and girls <b>born</b> <b>outside</b> <b>Europe,</b> had significantly lower ORs of poor SRH. Our results indicate that there are gender differences in the factors behind poor self-rated health, according to the country-related background of adolescents in Sweden...|$|E

HBV seropositivity {{was defined as the}} presence of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) or antibodies to HBV core or surface antigens by radioimmunoassay. HBsAg-positive students were advised to visit their family doctors; the health measures that resulted were observed. Among 600 students born in North America, the proportion of HBV seropositive and HBsAg-positive were 0. 8 and 0. 2 %, respectively. Among the 63 students <b>born</b> <b>outside</b> <b>Europe</b> or North America. 22. 2 % were HBV seropositive (odds ratio 29. 7. confidence interval 10. 1 to 97. 5) and 7. 9 % were HBsAg-positive (odds ratio 54. 2, confidence interval 5. 9 to 2568. 3). Of the seven HBsAg-positive students, none had known their HBV status – five visited their doctors, two of whom sought and immunized susceptible household contacts. This survey supports the view that many sexually active young adults integrating into Canadian society from immigrant families are unknowingly HBsAg-positive, and when their HBV status is identified to them and their doctors, appropriate measures for the protection of close contacts are often overlooked. Physician education about the management of HBV carriers should be improved and consideration given to the universal HBV immunization of young adults...|$|E
40|$|National audienceBACKGROUND: In France, {{epidemiological}} data on immigrant population are limited since characterization of immigrants {{is viewed as}} a sensitive issue. The Histoire de Vie survey has enabled the description of the association of immigration characteristics and two health indicators. METHODS: Health-related functional limitations and overweight status (BMI>/= 25 kg/m(2)) were studied among 18 to 64 years old using indirect age standardization. Immigration status was characterized in four different ways: via the migratory pathways of interviewees and their parents (French born to two French-born parents, second-generation, immigrated at the age of 15 or younger, immigrated at the age of 16 or older), citizenship (French by birth, French by naturalisation, non French), geographical origin (France, Europe, outside Europe) and language(s) spoken at home (French mother tongue, French for persons who do not have French as mother tongue, French and another language, another language). The analyses were conducted separately in men and in women and stratified by occupational status (upper and lower). For functional limitations, the analysis was repeated excluding participants whose limitations occurred before the age of 19, which was the average age of immigration, to assess a possible healthy migrant effect. RESULTS: Compared to French men born to two French parents, an increased rate of functional limitations was observed among men born in Europe and/or who had at least one parent born in Europe (SMR: 1. 4; 95 % CI: 1. 06 - 1. 81) and a reduced rate among participants <b>born</b> <b>outside</b> <b>Europe</b> or who had at least one parent <b>born</b> <b>outside</b> <b>Europe</b> (SMR: 0. 63; 95 % CI: 0. 46 - 0. 86); these differences remained when social status was taken into account. Among women, a tendency towards a lower rate of functional limitations was found in lower social status groups among those who immigrated as adults, among non French citizens and among non Europeans. Restricting the analysis to individuals free of limitations at the age of 19 did not suggest a healthier migrant effect. Among men, the risk of being overweight did not differ according to immigration characteristics. Women who immigrated in their adult life (SMR: 1. 42; 95 % CI: 1. 18 - 1. 74), who had foreign citizenship (SMR: 1. 44; 95 % CI: 1. 18 - 1. 74) and who still spoke their mother tongue at home (SMR: 1. 53; 95 %CI: 1. 23 - 1. 88) {{were more likely to be}} overweight than non migrant women. These results were observed in lower social groups but not in upper social groups. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate a heterogeneous relationship between immigration status and health, according to age at immigration, gender and origin while the migrant second-generation appears quite close to the population born French to two French-born parents. Further studies are needed to provide data on a wider range of health indicators. In the future, health surveys should document detailed information to allow for a full characterisation of the migrant population...|$|E
40|$|Recruiting Through Networks - Wage Premiums and Rewards to Recommenders This paper {{examines}} the firm's use of recommenders in its recruiting process. In the model, recommenders possess personal {{information about the}} worker's ability and about the workplace. In view of this private information, the firm may reward recommenders for good recruiting, thus using recommenders as a screening device. In equilibrium the expected skill of a worker is higher if recruitment has occurred through a recommender rather than through the market, {{but there is no}} wage premium. Swedish survey data supports the absence of a wage premium for recommended workers. It has not been possible to test the expected skill or the firm's reward policy vis-à-vis the recommender. Job Search by Immigrants in Sweden This paper analyses the job search strategies of immigrants <b>born</b> <b>outside</b> <b>Europe</b> and compares these with the search strategies of the native population. The analysis uses unique Swedish data gathered during 1998. Two clear patterns can be traced in the empirical analysis: immigrants search more intensively than natives; also, the greater search intensity is a requisite for getting a job. Specifically, the first analysis shows that immigrants who got jobs were likely to have used networks or direct contact with employers {{to a greater extent than}} natives. Immigrants who got jobs had submitted more applications and spent more time on job search than natives, while those who did not get jobs had not spent more time on job search than natives. The fourth and last analysis looks at the number of methods used in job search. Immigrants who left unemployment had not used more methods than natives. On the other hand, immigrants who remained unemployed had used significantly more methods than natives, indicating that it is not necessarily productive to use too many methods. Wage Effects of Search Methods for Immigrants and Natives in Sweden Using unique cross-section survey data collected in 1998, this study examines whether successful job-search method differ between natives and immigrants from outside Europe, and whether there is a wage difference between the two groups associated with the search method used. It is found that those individuals from outside Europe who got jobs did relatively better when using formal methods than when using informal ones. Next, a wage analysis has been performed, which shows that there is an overall wage discount for those <b>born</b> <b>outside</b> <b>Europe.</b> The discount is larger when using informal methods rather than formal. To explore this further the informal method measure is divided in two parts, one part for contacts through friends and family and the second for contacts with the employer. The penalty for immigrants from outside Europe using an informal method as a successive job-search device is partly explained by contact with the employer, suggesting that the penalty for using informal methods has been underestimated in previous studies. An attempt has also been made to control for the effect of unobservable characteristics on wages, but this did not have any significant impact...|$|E

40|$|In this {{population-based}} survey {{undertaken in}} Sweden in 2007, we investigated correlates of attitudes to human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among {{parents of children}} aged 12 – 15 years. We invited 16, 000 parents of girls and 4, 000 parents of boys, ran-domly selected from the Swedish population. Response rates were 70 and 69 %, respectively. Multinomial logistic regression models were applied to investigate correlates of acceptability to HPV vac-cination. Among studied parents, 76 % were willing to vaccinate their child if the vaccine is for free and 63 % were willing to vacci-nate even if the vaccine comes with a cost. Having heard of HPV was associated with both willingness to vaccinate if the vaccine is free (odds ratio [OR]: 1. 42; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 21 – 1. 66) and willingness to vaccinate even if the vaccine is not free (OR: 1. 96; 95 % CI: 1. 75 – 2. 20) compared with those who never heard of HPV. Beliefs about vaccine safety and efficacy were also strong correlates of willingness to vaccinate. Parents <b>born</b> <b>outside</b> <b>Europe</b> and those with higher education were less willing to vaccinate if the vaccine is not free. In conclusion, the willingness to vaccinate was reasonably high and cost {{did not appear to}} be a major barrier. Information about vaccine safety and efficacy is important and parents need information about HPV and the HPV vaccine...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Research on {{socio-economic}} {{determinants of}} migrant health inequalities {{has produced a}} large body of evidence. There is lack of evidence on the influence of structural factors on lives of fragile groups, frequently exposed to health inequalities. The role of poor socio-economic status and country level structural factors, such as migrant integration policies, in explaining migrant health inequalities is unclear. The objective {{of this paper is to}} examine the role of migrant socio-economic status and the impact of migrant integration policies on health inequalities during the recent economic crisis in Europe. Methods Using the 2012 wave of Eurostat EU-SILC data for a set of 23 European countries, we estimate multilevel mixed-effects ordered logit models for self-assessed poor health (SAH) and self-reported limiting long-standing illnesses (LLS), and multilevel mixed-effects logit models for self-reported chronic illness (SC). We estimate two-level models with individuals nested within countries, allowing for both individual socio-economic determinants of health and country-level characteristics (healthy life years expectancy, proportion of health care expenditure over the GDP, and problems in migrant integration policies, derived from the Migrant Integration Policy Index (MIPEX). Results Being a non-European citizen or <b>born</b> <b>outside</b> <b>Europe</b> does not increase the odds of reporting poor health conditions, in accordance with the “healthy migrant effect”. However, the country context in terms of problems in migrant integration policies influences negatively all of the three measures of health (self-reported health status, limiting long-standing illnesses, and self-reported chronic illness) in foreign people living in European countries, and partially offsets the “healthy migrant effect”. Conclusions Policies for migrant integration can reduce migrant health disparities...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Parental feeding {{practices}} shape children's {{relationships with}} food and eating. Feeding is embedded socioculturally in values and attitudes related to food and parenting. However, {{few studies have examined}} associations between parental feeding practices and migrant background. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. Parental feeding practices (restriction, pressure to eat, monitoring) were assessed using the Child Feeding Questionnaire. Differences were explored in four sub-samples grouped by maternal place of birth: Sweden, Nordic/Western Europe, Eastern/Southern Europe and countries outside Europe. Crude, partly and fully adjusted linear regression models were created. Potential confounding variables included child's age, gender and weight status, and mother's age, weight status, education and concern about child weight. SETTING: Malmö and Stockholm, Sweden. SUBJECTS: Mothers (n 1325, representing seventy-three countries; mean age 36 · 5 years; 28 · 1 % of non-Swedish background; 30 · 7 % with overweight/obesity; 62 · 8 % with university education) of pre-school children (mean age 4 · 8 years; 50 · 8 % boys; 18 · 6 % with overweight/obesity). RESULTS: Non-Swedish-born mothers, whether European-born or non-European-born, were more likely to use restriction. Swedish-born mothers and Nordic/Western European-born mothers reported lower levels of pressure to eat compared with mothers born in Eastern/Southern Europe and mothers <b>born</b> <b>outside</b> <b>Europe.</b> Differences in monitoring were small. Among the potential confounding variables, child weight status and concern about child weight were highly influential. Concern about child weight accounted for some of the effect of maternal origin on restriction. CONCLUSIONS: Non-European-born mothers were more concerned about children being overweight and more likely to report controlling feeding practices. Future research should examine acculturative and structural factors underlying differences in feeding...|$|E
