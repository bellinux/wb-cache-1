40|$|Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to exam the {{association}} of body composition, flexibility, and injury risk to genetic polymorphisms including ACE ID, ACTN 3 RX, and COL 5 A 1 polymorphisms in ballet dancers in Korea. [Methods] For the {{purpose of this}} study, elite <b>ballerinas</b> (n = 97) and normal female adults (n = 203) aged 18 to 39 were recruited and these participants were tested for body weight, height, body fat, fat free mass, flexibility, injury risks on the joints and gene polymorphisms (ACE, ACTN 3, COL 5 A 1 polymorphism). [Results] As results, the ACE DD genotype in <b>ballerinas</b> was associated with higher body fat and percentage of body fat than the ACE II and ID genotypes (p < 0. 05). In the study on the ACTN 3 polymorphism and <b>ballerinas,</b> the XX genotype in <b>ballerinas</b> had lower body weight and lower fat-free mass than the RR and RX genotype (p < 0. 005). Also, the means of sit and reach test for flexibility was lower in the ACTN 3 XX genotype of <b>ballerinas</b> than the RR and RX genotype of <b>ballerinas</b> (p < 0. 05). Among the sports injuries, the ankle injury of the XX-genotyped <b>ballerinas</b> was in significantly more prevalence than the RR and XX-genotyped <b>ballerinas</b> (p < 0. 05). According to the odd ratio analysis, XX-genotyped <b>ballerinas</b> have the injury risk on the ankle about 4. 7 (95 % CI: 1. 6 ~ 13. 4, p < 0. 05) times more than the RR and RX-genotyped <b>ballerinas.</b> Meanwhile, the COL 5 A 1 polymorphism in <b>ballerinas</b> has no association with any factors including flexibility and injury risks.

40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{this study}} is to examine interoceptive awareness, {{ineffectiveness}} and maturity fears in Turkish ballet dancers and <b>ballerinas</b> with respect body mass index (BMI) type to and gender. The study sample of the research is consisted of 215 ballet dancers and <b>ballerinas</b> who were recruited randomly from State Conservatories in some cities of Turkey. Multidimensional Eating Behaviors Inventory was used to collect data. Findings on BMI indicated that thin weight ballet dancers and <b>ballerinas</b> have significantly higher means about interoceptive awareness than normal weight ballet dancers and <b>ballerinas.</b> There were no significant difference on maturity fears and ineffectiveness. When findings were analyzed according to gender, it was found that <b>ballerinas</b> have higher means on interoceptive awareness and ineffectiveness than ballet dancers. However, it was not found any significant difference between ballet dancers and <b>ballerinas</b> on maturity fears...|$|R

5|$|For Carlotta Grisi's {{performances}} as Giselle {{with the}} Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg, Perrot commissioned the composer Cesare Pugni {{to score a}} new pas de cinq for the <b>ballerina</b> that {{was added to the}} first tableau. This pas was only retained for Grisi's performances and never performed again after her departure from St. Petersburg. Marius Petipa would also commission an additional piece for the first tableau of the ballet. This was a pas de deux from the composer Ludwig Minkus that was added to the choreographer's 1884 revival for the <b>ballerina</b> Maria Gorshenkova. As with Pugni's 1850 pas de cinq for Grisi, Gorshenkova's 1884 pas de deux by Minkus never became part of the performance tradition of Giselle.|$|E
5|$|Hippos {{have also}} been popular cartoon characters, where their rotund frames are used for humorous effect. For example, the Disney film Fantasia {{featured}} a <b>ballerina</b> hippopotamus dancing to the opera La Gioconda, and Hanna-Barbera created Peter Potamus.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the chief {{machinist}} shouting orders to his crew that could be heard by the audience, Giselle was a great success. Grisi was a sensation. Ballet-goers regarded her as another Marie Taglioni, the greatest <b>ballerina</b> of the period.|$|E

Both characters are depicted nude, and one nipple of the phoenix's breasts and her buttocks are visible. The artist later said that Kanye wanted a cover image that would be banned. The painting is centered with a thin yellow border on a red background. The artwork follows along the apparent theme of the album, as well as West's music film Runaway. This {{is one of five}} covers; all of them were included with its purchase. A second cover, with a painting of a <b>ballerina</b> by Condo, was posted on the Amazon.com pre-order page.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: The study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the association between postural changes and practice of classical ballet among <b>ballerinas</b> from Integrated Administrative Region of Development (RIDE) in Polo Petrolina/PE and Juazeiro/BA. Methods: Cross-sectional observational study with 19 classical <b>ballerinas</b> aged over 15 years and at least 5 years of uninterrupted classical ballet practice. The anthropometric assessment included measurements of total body mass, height and body mass index (BMI). Postural evaluation was performed using the photogrammetric method with help of Posturograma(r) and SAPO(c) software. Results: The mean age was 25. 3 ± 11. 7 years and the mean BMI was 21. 4 ± 2. 9 kg/m². Approximately 74 % of classical <b>ballerinas</b> had normal anthropometric profile. The postural profile of the classical <b>ballerinas</b> showed inclination and protrusion of the head, trunk rotation, rectification of cervical lordosis, increased thoracic kyphosis, increased lumbar lordosis, pelvic inclination and anteversion. Conclusion: The practice of ballet led to changes in body alignment of the classical <b>ballerinas</b> evaluated. The results points out to the need of postural re-education in order to contribute for the kinetic-functional balance of classical ballet practitioners...|$|R

5|$|A second {{victim is}} found, {{this time a}} man whose eyes have been removed by forced surgery. Again, they {{discover}} the eyes were obtained from organ donation, and they find a connection to a woman called Amanda (Anja Savcic), a <b>ballerina</b> who had committed suicide. They also note the care that the culprit performed the work, and speculate that the person {{they are looking for}} is showing some compassion for his victims, calling for emergency help and using the serum to hope that they are given the proper care in time. They find that Amanda's alleged cremated remains are bogus, and that her body had been stolen before it could be cremated. They start to trace connections to Amanda, finding she was in a depression counseling support group. Though there are several possible suspects, Olivia's intuition leads her to a man named Roland David Barrett (Mark Ivanir), who was noted to have become enamored with Amanda at the meetings. At Roland's home, he has recovered the corpse and surgically replaced the organs in her body. Using a makeshift set of ropes and pulleys, Roland engages Amanda's body in a marionette act to make her perform like a <b>ballerina,</b> promising her he will bring her back to life.|$|E

Limelight was heavily autobiographical, alluding not only to Chaplin's childhood and the lives of his parents, but also to his loss of popularity in the United States. The cast included various members of his family, including his five oldest children and his half-brother, Wheeler Dryden.|$|E

Titus chose Giselle. The Ballet Master then staged the work completely from memory in St. Petersburg. Perrot produced Giselle in St. Petersburg in 1851. He made many changes to the ballet in his years of service to the Imperial Ballet. In the 1880s, Petipa made many changes to the Perrot production.|$|E
5|$|Giselle was {{performed}} in Paris from its debut in 1841 to 1849, with Grisi always dancing the title role. In 1849, it was dropped from the repertoire.
