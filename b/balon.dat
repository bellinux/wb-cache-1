5|$|<b>Balon</b> Greyjoy {{speaks to}} Yara about their {{war against the}} North. Yara {{points out that the}} armies of the North have retaken all of the Ironborn strongholds on the mainland, and pleads with him to end the war. However, <b>Balon</b> refuses and vows to send more troops to stage another {{invasion}} of the North. As <b>Balon</b> heads outside, he encounters his brother, Euron Greyjoy, who has come to overthrow him. <b>Balon</b> attempts to stab Euron, who throws him off a bridge to his death. At Balon's funeral, Yara swears revenge against Balon's killer, but is reminded by her uncle Aeron, a Drowned Priest, that her position as successor depends on the results of the Kingsmoot, a ceremony where the Ironborn elect their new leader.|$|E
5|$|Although he has {{defeated}} the Lannisters three {{times on the}} battlefield, Robb knows that he cannot beat them alone. For this reason, he reluctantly agrees to send Theon Greyjoy to his father, Lord <b>Balon</b> Greyjoy, to convince Lord Greyjoy to join them with all the naval force of the Iron Islands. While his mother Catelyn wishes to return to Winterfell {{to be with her}} sons Bran and Rickon, Robb asks her to travel to Renly's court to negotiate an alliance. Catelyn tells Robb that his father would be proud of what Robb has accomplished, but warns him that <b>Balon</b> Greyjoy is not to be trusted.|$|E

5|$|After the Canadiens were {{eliminated}} {{for the third}} straight year in the first playoff round during the spring of 1963, there was mounting pressure for change from their fans and media. Growing tension between Plante and Blake because of Plante's inconsistent work ethic and demeanor caused Blake to declare that for the 1963–64 season either he or Plante must go. On June 4, 1963, Plante was traded to the New York Rangers, with Phil Goyette and Don Marshall in exchange for Gump Worsley, Dave <b>Balon,</b> Leon Rochefort, and Len Ronson. Plante played for the Rangers for one full season and part of a second. He retired in 1965 while playing for the minor-league Baltimore Clippers of the American Hockey League. His wife was ill at the time, and he required surgery on his right knee.|$|E

Later that year, he placed fifth for the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year award, with 134 votes, and fourth for the prestigious Ballon d'Or, receiving 149 points. Barcelona extended his contract by one year, until 2015, and raised his buy-out clause to €200million.|$|E
25|$|The Starks {{declare war}} on the Lannisters {{for the death of}} Ned and having won three victories, Robb Stark offers the Lannisters peace in {{exchange}} for the North's independence, sending Theon Greyjoy to gain <b>Balon</b> Greyjoy's support and Catelyn Stark to seek Renly Baratheon's. Cersei Lannister rejects Robb's terms. Meanwhile, Tyrion Lannister exiles Janos Slynt, head of the Gold Cloaks, to the Wall, promoting Bronn to commander of the watch.|$|E
25|$|Davos discovers {{a request}} by the Night's Watch for aid against Mance Rayder and the Others. Melisandre tries to persuade Stannis to {{sacrifice}} Edric Storm, a bastard son of Stannis' late brother King Robert Baratheon, to wake the dragons. Stannis is reluctant, though he uses Edric's blood in leeches to curse the three rival Kings. After <b>Balon,</b> Robb and Joffrey die, apparently proving the power of King's blood, Davos has Edric smuggled to safety. Stannis prepares to execute Davos for treason but is prevented when Davos shows Stannis the Night's Watch's plea.|$|E
25|$|With the {{departure}} of Ludovic Giuly ahead of the 2007–08 campaign, Iniesta was able to switch his number 24 shirt for his preferred number 8. Despite rumours of a possible transfer before the season, he extended his contract to 2014 on 25 January 2008, with his buy-out clause being raised to €150million. Don <b>Balón,</b> a member of European Sports Magazines, named Iniesta {{one of the most}} consistent performers in the previous two seasons of La Liga; he placed fifth in 2006–07 and fourth in 2007–08. He also placed ninth in the 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year voting, gaining 37 total points.|$|E
25|$|On the Iron Islands, Aeron Damphair hears of Balon's {{death and}} that Balon's eldest {{surviving}} brother, Euron Greyjoy, has returned from exile and claimed the Seastone Chair. To prevent this Aeron calls a Kingsmoot to identify <b>Balon</b> Greyjoy's successor as {{king of the}} Iron Islands. Hotly contested by Balon's brother Victarion Greyjoy and daughter Asha Greyjoy, eventually Euron is chosen as king for his promise to control dragons with an enchanted horn he possesses. The fleet of the Iron Men captures the Shield Islands {{at the mouth of}} the river Mander, threatening House Tyrell's seat at Highgarden. Victarion estimates that when the Redwyne fleet returns from the siege at Dragonstone it will retake the islands; and when Euron sends him east to woo Daenerys Targaryen on his behalf, to thus gain a claim to the Iron Throne, Victarion decides to woo her for himself instead.|$|E
25|$|Raúl {{was named}} the best striker {{in the world by}} International Federation of Football History & Statistics in 1999, and is the only player to be named UEFA Club Forward of the Year three times, in 2000, 2001 and 2002. He ranked second in the Ballon d'Or 2001 and third in the 2001 FIFA World Player of the Year.

25|$|Robb's forces dwindle further at the Battle of Duskendale, {{wherein the}} eastern half of the Stark's armies, under the command of Roose Bolton, are ambushed by a joint army under Gregor Clegane and Lord Randyll Tarly. More losses are taken as the army retreats. Meanwhile, the Greyjoys now hold the Neck, having taken Moat Cailin, thus barring Robb from {{returning}} to his homeland. To recapture Moat Cailin from the Greyjoys, Robb relies on the support of the Freys. When Lord Hoster Tully dies, Catelyn's brother Edmure becomes Lord of Riverrun and Lord Paramount of the Trident. Robb gains renewed hope when he learns that <b>Balon</b> Greyjoy has died in a fall from a bridge, whereafter two of Balon's brothers, as well as his daughter Asha, vie to succeed him. The Freys propose a wedding between Edmure and Roslin Frey, one of Lord Walder Frey's daughters, to compensate for the loss of Robb's marriage.|$|E

500|$|The 2002–03 {{season was}} the club's best league {{performance}} since the 1981–82 season, {{in which they}} won the league. The Basque team finished second, two points behind Real Madrid, setting a club record for their highest ever points total, and qualifying for the UEFA Champions League for the first time. Alonso received much praise {{for his role in}} the team's success and was given the Best Spanish Player award by Spanish sports magazine Don <b>Balón.</b> In addition, Alonso significantly contributed to the team's goal tally, scoring 12 goals in all competitions. His performances earned Alonso national repute and Iñaki Sáez, the coach of the Spanish national team, called him up for La Selección. Alonso made his international debut in April 2003 in a 4–0 friendly win over Ecuador. Sáez raved over Alonso, saying, [...] "He has a fantastic range of accurate passing [...] sees football with an extraordinary clarity." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{principal}} story {{chronicles the}} power {{struggle for the}} Iron Throne among the great Houses of Westeros {{following the death of}} King Robert in A Game of Thrones. Robert's heir apparent, the 13-year old Joffrey, is immediately proclaimed king through the machinations of his mother, Queen Cersei Lannister. When Lord Eddard [...] "Ned" [...] Stark, Robert's chief advisor, discovers that Joffrey and his siblings are the product of incest between Cersei and her twin brother Jaime [...] "The Kingslayer" [...] Lannister, Eddard attempts to unseat Joffrey but is betrayed and executed for treason. In response, Robert's brothers Stannis and Renly both lay separate claims to the throne. During this period of instability, two of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros attempt to become independent from the Iron Throne: Eddard's eldest son Robb is proclaimed King in the North, while <b>Balon</b> Greyjoy desires to recover the sovereignty of his region, the Iron Islands. The so-called [...] "War of the Five Kings" [...] is in full progress {{by the middle of the}} second book, A Clash of Kings.|$|E
500|$|Since retiring, Pelé has {{continued}} to be lauded by players, coaches, journalists and others. Brazilian attacking midfielder Zico, who represented Brazil at the 1978, 1982 and 1986 FIFA World Cup, stated; [...] "This debate about the player of the century is absurd. There's only one possible answer: Pelé. He's the greatest player of all time, and by some distance I might add". French three time <b>Balon</b> D'or winner Michel Platini said; [...] "There's Pelé the man, and then Pelé the player. And to play like Pelé is to play like God." [...] Joint FIFA Player of the Century, Argentina's 1986 FIFA World Cup-winning captain Diego Maradona stated; [...] "It's too bad we never got along, but he was an awesome player".

2500|$|In the A Song of Ice and Fire series, the War of the Five Kings is fought between {{different}} claimants to the Iron Throne of Westeros, {{as well to}} the thrones of the individual regions of Westeros (Joffrey Baratheon, Stannis Baratheon, Renly Baratheon, Robb Stark and <b>Balon</b> Greyjoy) ...|$|E
2500|$|Later, Melisandre visits Gendry and seduces him, tying {{him to a}} bed in the process.

2500|$|Temporal {{segregation}} is a {{less common}} form of resource partitioning, but it is nonetheless an observed phenomenon. Typically, it accounts for coexistence by relating it to differences in life history patterns and the timing of maximum growth among guild mates.

2500|$|Ballon (...) is the {{appearance}} of being lightweight and light-footed while jumping. It is a desirable aesthetic in ballet and other dance genres, making it seem as though a dancer effortlessly becomes airborne, floats in the air, and lands softly.

2500|$|A Storm of Swords {{picks up}} the story {{slightly}} {{before the end of}} its predecessor, A Clash of Kings. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros are still in the grip of the War of the Five Kings, wherein Joffrey Baratheon and Stannis Baratheon compete for the Iron Throne while Robb Stark and <b>Balon</b> Greyjoy declare their independence. Meanwhile, a large host of wildlings approach the Wall under the leadership of Mance Rayder, the self-proclaimed [...] "King Beyond the Wall", with only the undermanned Night's Watch in opposition. Finally, Daenerys Targaryen approaches Pentos.|$|E
2500|$|The sixth season saw {{the return}} of Isaac Hempstead Wright as Bran Stark, Kristian Nairn as Hodor, Ellie Kendrick as Meera Reed, Gemma Whelan as Yara Greyjoy, and Rory McCann as Sandor [...] "The Hound" [...] Clegane, [...] who did {{not appear in the}} fifth season. Clive Russell, Tobias Menzies, Patrick Malahide, Richard Dormer and Paul Kaye also {{returned}} to the show as Brynden Tully, Edmure Tully, <b>Balon</b> Greyjoy, Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr after not appearing since the third season.

2500|$|Theon Greyjoy (Alfie Allen), a main {{cast member}} {{from the first}} season, but with lesser {{importance}} than the others, came to prominence during the second season, as his story unfolded and his character became more central. Gemma Whelan appeared as his sister, Yara Greyjoy. Named [...] "Asha" [...] in the novels, the character's name was changed to avoid confusion with the Wildling Osha, Bran Stark's companion. [...] "Asha" [...] is portrayed as a fairly provocative and independent woman, a captain of thirty ships, as opposed to her television counterpart Yara, who did not retain [...] "Asha's" [...] traits, although her rivalry with Theon remained intact. Their father <b>Balon</b> Greyjoy was played by Patrick Malahide. Many of the characters involved in the Greyjoys' storyline weren't introduced, most notably Balon's brother Aeron Greyjoy. Nonetheless, the storyline received enormous praise, with the alternation of Yara's name and persona being the only criticism.|$|E
