Mike wasn't the guy. We had fun playing with him but always knew, in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> minds, that he wasn't where we needed him to be mentally."

500|$|Death Cab for Cutie {{had been}} {{contacted}} by major labels on-and-off for several years, {{but it was}} only after the proven success of Transatlanticism that they decided to start talking to labels about a potential deal. The fact that they had already achieved considerable success allowed the band to negotiate with a lot of creative freedom. According to their manager Jordan Kurland, the band had spoken to [...] "pretty much all of them", and then decided they were most satisfied with their offer from Atlantic Records. In November 2004, the band signed a “long-term worldwide deal” with Atlantic, leaving their long-time label Barsuk Records. Gibbard stated on the band's official website that nothing would change, except that [...] "next to the picture of Barsuk holding a 7", there will be the letter [...] "A" [...] on both the spine and <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> upcoming albums." [...] After signing to Atlantic, the band was still nervous about corporate economics, and encouraged fans to download its songs from the Internet.|$|E

[...] Considered a last-ditch effort since it would not provide cooling, such a plan would require massive reinforcement under the floor, as for the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus.|$|E
2500|$|The 2013 Stanley Cup {{run by the}} Bruins was {{one that}} further united the New England region that had been rocked by tragedies, such as the Boston Marathon bombing and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.

It hit close to home, and the best way we felt we could try and cheer the area was to win a Stanley Cup. I think that's what's hard right now for the players. We had more reasons than just ourselves to win a Cup." ...|$|E

We were never nervous about Anette, or the album being good, but we just couldn't tell how people would take it. Would they like Anette? Would they like the music? That was in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> minds all the time. And there was such a huge amount of money involved, over 800.000 euros, that we needed to sell at least a few albums to get going," [...] Tuomas Holopainen was recalling in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Apple iMac was {{introduced}} in 1998 and its innovative design was directly the result of Jobs's return to Apple. Apple boasted [...] "the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> computer looks better than the front of anyone else's." [...] Described as [...] "cartoonlike", the first iMac, clad in Bondi Blue plastic, was unlike any personal computer that came before. In 1999, Apple introduced the Graphite gray Apple iMac and since has varied the shape, colour and size considerably while maintaining the all-in-one design. Design ideas were intended to create a connection with the user such as the handle and a breathing light effect when the computer went to sleep. The Apple iMac sold for $1,299 at that time. The iMac also featured some technical innovations, such as having USB ports as the only device inputs. This latter change resulted, through the iMac's success, in the interface being popularised among third party peripheral makers – {{as evidenced by the}} fact that many early USB peripherals were made of translucent plastic (to match the iMac design).|$|E

5000|$|In {{answer to}} the {{question}} of why he writes poetry, Coburn has said [...] "It simply isn’t a conscious decision I make to write poetry, but an impulsion that cannot be ignored. Poetry photographs parts of life and humanity that can’t be captured visually, at least in a literal sense. It dissects the hopelessness of being alive and makes it seem to develop meaning momentarily, even if it never actually does.If our most private and affecting inner thoughts and memories, the ones we keep silently at the <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> minds, were given a voice, it would be poetry.

That we have groped for the way of right conduct and agonized over the soul betokens our spiritual endowment. Though we have strayed often and far from righteousness, the voices of the seers have always been raised, and we have harked back to the bidding of conscience. The colossal fact of our history is that we have made the religion of Jesus Christ our religion. No matter how dark in error and deed, ours has been a history of spiritual struggle and endeavour. We are pre-eminently a religious race, which is another way of saying that we are a right-seeking race.|$|E
