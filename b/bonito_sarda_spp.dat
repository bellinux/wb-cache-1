40|$|The main objetive of {{this work}} was to obtain the {{desorption}} isotherms of Atlantic <b>bonito</b> (<b>Sarda</b> sarda) fillets, previously subjected to an immersion impregnation process with NaCl solutions and smoked in liquid smoke.

The experimental data were fitted to four models (linearized BET, GAB, Henderson and modified Oswin). The results showed that a type II sigmoidal isotherm, with GAB equation, gave the best fit.

40|$|Abstract A maximum {{likelihood}} approach is described {{for the analysis}} of growth increment data derived from tagging experiments. As well as describing mean growth this approach allows the separate estimation of measurement error and growth variability, and uses mixture theory to provide an objective way of dealing with outliers. The method is illustrated using data for Pacific <b>bonito</b> (<b>Sarda</b> chiliensis) and the growth variability model is compared to other published models. The difference between growth curves derived from tagging and age-length data is emphasised and new parameters are given for the von Bertalanffy curve that have better statistical properties, and represent better the growth information in tagging data, than do the conventional parameters.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{development}} of an acoustic telemetry tag used to monitor electromyograms (EMGs) remotely from free-swimming marine fish. The device described amplifies and filters the EMG and then converts the electrical waveform into a frequency-modulated acoustic signal that is transmitted through water. The signal is then received, demodulated and recorded by the receiving system. The EMG tag described has been tested on a range of species, including toadfish Opsanus tau, spiny dogfish Squalus acanthias, yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares and eastern Pacific <b>bonito</b> <b>Sarda</b> chiliensis, in different tank Summary environments. In certain tanks the fidelity with which the system replicates the EMG is sufficient to quantify accurately the onset, offset, duration, the integrated area under the absolute value of the signal and the number of signal zero crossings. This EMG tag will expand the scope of questions that can be addressed about the behavior and physiology of free-swimming fish...|$|R

Four varieties of tuna are largely exploited in the coastal waters. Of these, Baleya or the skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis Linn. 1758) is the predominant variety followed by attavalla or mackerel tuna (Euthynnus ajfinis, Cantor, 1850), kelawalla or yellowfin (Thunnus albacares, Bonnaterre, 1788) and alagoduwa or frigate mackerel (Auxis thazard Lacepede, 1802). Other varieties like the thora-baleya or <b>bonito</b> (<b>Sarda</b> orientalis) and asgedi kelawalla or big eye tuna (Thunnus obesus) are also landed frequently but in extremely small quantities.
