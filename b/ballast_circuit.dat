40|$|LED light sources, {{which are}} more compact, capable to change color in real time, less dissipative, and more durable are finding more {{applications}} than conventional light bulbs in domestic, commercial, and industrial environments. However, requirements such as high-power factor, long lifetime, accurate current control, and high-efficiency pose challenges {{to the design of}} LED <b>ballast</b> <b>circuits.</b> This paper proposes an LED ballast with a dual noncascading structure. The first-stage noncascading structure is an isolated current-fed power factor correction (PFC) preregulator. In the proposed design, the short-lifetime high-voltage storage capacitor at the primary is replaced by a long-lifetime low-voltage capacitor at the secondary, thus extending the overall system lifetime. The PFC is programmed by the conventional averaged current-mode control for high-power-factor applications. Furthermore, the high-voltage stress on the main switch, which is typical in current-fed converters, is reduced substantially by appropriately exploiting the transformer leakage inductance. The design uses two secondary transformer windings and an LED current driver to form a second noncascading structure to improve efficiency. Multiple noncascading structures can be used for LED lamps for instant independent brightness control. Analysis, design example, and prototype verification are given for the LED ballast.

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 56 - 57). Power electronics {{is a means of}} controlling/processing in an appropriate way that is suitable for the load. Power conditioning is done to ensure higher efficiency and power density. Improved efficiency can reduce emission of heat/wasted power so that it can reduces environmental pollution. Power electronic converters use semi-conductor switching devices that are operated in ON-OFF states. These converters have higher efficiency with the control of distorted input signals. The input signal distortion increases with the increased use of these converters. Various standards have been set to limit the level of distortion. One of the ways of measuring these distortions is THD. A signal having THD more than the specified range has some detrimental effect on the line to which it is connected. Lighting loads are one of the major powering applications. Approximately 19 % to 20 % of the power is used for this purpose. As a result high efficient lighting system is a major research area in power electronics. In this regard incandescent bulbs were replaced by discharge lights (those are operated in negative resistance region) long ago. A <b>ballast</b> <b>circuit</b> is included to limit the current flow in this circuit. Initially magnetic ballasts were used. However due to some disadvantages like flickering, size, high cost, low efficiency etc electronic ballast has taken place instead of magnetic ballast. The focus of this thesis is in the electronic ballasts in discharge lamps and the total harmonic distortion produced due to the non-linear circuit situated in the lamps. The main objective is to minimize this distortion as far as possible. Various simulations have been done in order to measure the total harmonic distortion of <b>ballast</b> <b>circuit</b> situated on the CFL bulb.

40|$|The {{control circuit}} of {{electronic}} power supplies for a High Intensity Discharge (HID) lamp is relatively complicated. The {{development of a}} ballast for a new lamp is usually a trial and error activity. Following this development method, an optimum design is never possible. The current development in microelectronics opens the possibility to digitize {{a big part of}} the HID lamp <b>ballast</b> control <b>circuit.</b> Digitalization based on a microcontroller is expensive (short instalment). Also the microcontroller application gives some advantages, such as better performance and faster development method, more flexibility for complex algorithm implementation, and expansion possibility for the user-interface (communication). In this thesis a controlled ballast based on 80 Cl 66 is presented for a 32 Watt DC HID lamp. This ballast is divided into 4 blocks: preconditioner (preliminary a 400 Volt power supply), high efficiency (95 %) 200 kHz/ 32 Watt Buck converter based on ZVS-QSC (Zero-Voltage-Switch Quasi-Square wave-Converter), ignitor (fly-back converter, 1. 6 kV DC), and control circuit (Current Mode Controller and 80 Cl 66). With the Current Mode Controller (CMC), the Buck converter can operate in open circuit, short circuit, and normal state. The control algorithm is implemented in the 80 Cl 66 microcontroller. This control algorithm consists of three states: initialization, ignition, and power regulation. The controlled ballast based on 80 Cl 66 is able to feed the 32 Watt DC HID lamp correctly. The power regulation is based on the small signal p-i characteristic of the lamp, which is derived from a system identification. By a good approximation the power variation only depends on the current variation.
