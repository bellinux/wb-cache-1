You may {{recollect}} that, when you sailed, he was starting his journalistic career. For a young writer he had done remarkably well. The Daily Telephone had printed two of his contributions to their correspondence column, and a <b>bright</b> <b>pen</b> picture of his, describing how Lee's Lozenges for the Liver had snatched him from almost certain death, had quite a vogue. Lee, I believe, actually commissioned him to do a series on the subject." ...|$|E

50|$|A veteran {{police detective}} has testified {{that it is}} unthinkable that trained police {{investigators}} would have overlooked a <b>bright</b> pink <b>pen</b> on a relatively low doorframe, and even more unthinkable that such a thing could happen twice. The investigators called to search Ishikawa’s house were the top professionals from the area. By the time Ishikawa was arrested, the case had already become a scandal, and the police were doing {{whatever it took to}} find the culprit. They spared no cost or personnel in conducting as thorough a search as possible. Furthermore, the doorframe is mentioned in all standard police detective textbooks as a routine location to search.|$|R
5000|$|After the war, having {{completed}} his Borinage series to much acclaim, {{there was a}} growing demand for murals and frescos by Aegerter. During the ensuing decade he completed more than ten murals, none of which have survived except one. These gross format works drew on classical symbolism {{as well as the}} Neue Sachlichkeit, with strong clear lines, which his good friend and artistic colleague, , had popularized in Switzerland (exhibition in the Kunsthalle Basel 1959, K.A., Niklaus Stoecklin). With the death of his wife Elisabeth Gerter, the human figure disappeared from his painting and his work became more and more focused on architectural subjects and landscapes. Not only did the human figure slowly leave his work, but human suffering as well. His late works offer up generous landscapes, alpine settings, peaceful natural scenes - new horizons and a new palette, working with <b>bright</b> felt <b>pens,</b> a modern development, to layout his later works. [...] Aegerter’s works are prized in numerous private and public collections around the world. His work has often been likened that of Edvard Munch.|$|R
