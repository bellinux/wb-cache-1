5|$|The local {{symptoms}} of victims <b>bitten</b> <b>by</b> the many-banded krait are usually neither serious swelling nor pain; the victims merely feel slightly itchy and numb. Systemic symptoms occur, in general, one {{to six hours}} after being <b>bitten</b> <b>by</b> this snake. Symptoms may include bilateral ptosis, diplopia, discomfort in the chest, general ache, weak feeling in limbs, ataxia, glossolysis, loss of voice, dysphagia, tunnel vision, and difficulty breathing. In case of serious bite, suppression of breathing may occur, leading to death. Hyponatremia is also seen, but less commonly.|$|E
5|$|Two {{cases from}} Liberia {{experienced}} severe neurological symptoms, including ptosis, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, and respiratory distress. A child in Ghana died within 20 minutes after being <b>bitten</b> <b>by</b> a snake suspected {{to be from}} this species.|$|E
5|$|In {{a parody}} of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Homer begins to {{decorate}} the house for Halloween and is reaching for a decoration in a box. Unfortunately, {{there is a real}} Black Widow spider in the box and when Homer grabs what he thinks is a plastic spider, he is <b>bitten</b> <b>by</b> it. The bite leaves Homer paralyzed and unable to speak. When Lisa reads for him, she discovers that he can communicate through farting. The Simpson family is amazed at the result and Lisa helps Homer tell Marge how he feels about her. When he is again <b>bitten</b> <b>by</b> another spider (a radioactive one this time), he gains the ability to shoot spider webs out of his rear end and have the same abilities as Spider-Man, though he is still unable to move or talk.|$|E

5|$|In another case, 28-year-old British student Nathan Layton was <b>bitten</b> <b>by</b> a {{black mamba}} {{and died of}} a heart attack in less than an hour in March 2008. The black mamba had been found near a {{classroom}} at the Southern African Wildlife College in Hoedspruit, where Layton was training to be a safari guide. Layton was <b>bitten</b> <b>by</b> the snake on his index finger while it was being put into a jar, but he didn't realize he'd been bitten. He thought the snake had only brushed his hand. Approximately 30 minutes after being bitten Layton complained of blurred vision. He collapsed and {{died of a heart}} attack, nearly an hour after being bitten. Attempts to revive him failed, and he was pronounced dead at the scene.|$|E
5|$|Some early {{travellers}} found dodo meat unsavoury, {{and preferred}} to eat parrots and pigeons; others {{described it as}} tough but good. Some hunted dodos only for their gizzards, as this was considered the most delicious part of the bird.

40|$|Spiders of {{the family}} Theraphosidae occur {{throughout}} most tropical regions of the world. There have only been three case reports of <b>bites</b> <b>by</b> these spiders in Australia. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the clinical effects of <b>bites</b> <b>by</b> Australian theraphosid spiders in both humans and canines. Cases of spider <b>bite</b> were collected <b>by</b> the authors over the period January 1978 –April 2002, either prospectively in a large study of Australian spider bites, or retrospectively from cases reported to the authors. Subjects were included if they had a definite bite and had collected the spider. The spiders were identified by an expert arachnologist to genus and species level where possible. There were nine confirmed <b>bites</b> <b>by</b> spiders {{of the family}} Theraphosidae in humans and seven in canines. These included <b>bites</b> <b>by</b> two Selenocosmia spp. and by two Phlogiellus spp. The nine spider bites in humans did not cause major effects. Local pain was the commonest effect, with severe pain in four of seven cases where severity of pain was recorded. Puncture marks or bleeding were the next most common effect. In one case the spider had bitten through the patient’s fingernail. Mild systemic effects occurred in one of nine cases. There were seven bites in dogs (Phlogellius spp. and Selenocosmia spp.), and in two of these the owner was bitten after the dog. In all seven cases the dog died, and as rapidly as 0. 5 – 2 h after the bite. This small series of <b>bites</b> <b>by</b> Australian theraphosid spiders gives an indication of the spectrum of toxicity of these spiders in humans. <b>Bites</b> <b>by</b> these spiders are unlikely to cause major problems in humans.

5|$|Alexander {{controversially}} {{married the}} commoner Aspasia Manos in 1919, provoking a major scandal that forced {{the couple to}} leave Greece for several months. Soon after returning to Greece with his wife, Alexander was <b>bitten</b> <b>by</b> a domestic Barbary macaque and died of sepsis. The sudden death of the sovereign led to questions over the monarchy's survival {{and contributed to the}} fall of the Venizelist regime.

5|$|American crows succumb {{easily to}} West Nile virus infection. This was {{originally}} a mosquito-borne African virus causing encephalitis in humans and livestock since about 1000 AD, and was accidentally introduced to North America in 1999, apparently by an infected air traveller who got <b>bitten</b> <b>by</b> a mosquito after arrival. It {{is estimated that}} the American crow population has dropped by up to 45% since 1999. Despite this decline, the crow is considered a species of least concern.|$|E

5|$|Hensley {{was arrested}} in Tennessee on moonshine-related charges during the Prohibition era and sentenced to a term in a workhouse, from which he escaped and fled the state. Hensley {{traveled}} to Ohio, where he held revival services, though {{he and his family}} rarely stayed long in one location. He established churches, known as the Church of God with Signs Following, in Tennessee and Kentucky. His services ranged from small meetings held in houses to large gatherings that drew media attention and hundreds of attendees. Although he conducted many services, he made little money, and he was arrested for violating laws against snake handling at least twice. During his ministry, Hensley claimed to have been <b>bitten</b> <b>by</b> many snakes without ill effect, and {{toward the end of his}} career, he estimated that he had survived more than 400bites. In 1955, while conducting a service in Florida, he was <b>bitten</b> <b>by</b> a snake and became violently ill. He refused to seek medical attention and died the following day. Despite his personal failings, he convinced many residents of rural Appalachia that snake handling was commanded by God, and his followers continued the practice after his death. Although snake handling developed independently in several Pentecostal ministries, Hensley is generally credited with spreading the custom in the Southeastern United States.|$|E

5|$|Coward {{was born}} in 1899 in Teddington, Middlesex, a {{south-western}} suburb of London. His parents were Arthur Sabin Coward (18561937), a piano salesman, and Violet Agnes Coward (18631954), daughter of , a captain and surveyor in the Royal Navy. Violet's cousin, Rachel Veitch, was mother of Field-Marshal Douglas Haig. Noël Coward was the second of their three sons, the eldest of whom had died in 1898 {{at the age of}} six. Coward's father lacked ambition and industry, and family finances were often poor. Coward was <b>bitten</b> <b>by</b> the performing bug early and appeared in amateur concerts by the age of seven. He attended the Chapel Royal Choir School as a young child. He had little formal schooling but was a voracious reader.|$|E
5|$|Fleas are vectors for viral, {{bacterial}} and rickettsial {{diseases of}} humans and other animals, {{as well as of}} protozoan and helminth parasites. Bacterial diseases carried by fleas include murine or endemic typhus. and bubonic plague. Fleas can transmit Rickettsia typhi, Rickettsia felis, and Bartonella henselae, and the myxomatosis virus. They can carry Hymenolepiasis tapeworms and Trypanosome protozoans. The chigoe flea or jigger (Tunga penetrans) causes the disease tungiasis, a major public health problem around the world. Fleas that specialize as parasites on specific mammals may use other mammals as hosts; thus, humans may be <b>bitten</b> <b>by</b> cat and dog fleas.|$|E
40|$|Records of {{clinical}} assistance and of post-exposure antirabies prophylaxis from 4820 outpatients {{who attended the}} Antirabies Center of Rome following animal bites in 1986 were analysed. We observed {{a high proportion of}} people submitted to active immunization (44 % received at least one shot of HDCV vaccine) {{in spite of the fact}} that rabies is absent from Central Italy since many decades in both wild and domestic animals. These considerations suggest the opportunity of a major revision of the official recommendations for rabies prevention, and we feel that different policies should be adopted in rabies enzootic areas (such as Northern Italy) compared to those where the risk is only potential. Immunization should be avoided after <b>bites</b> <b>by</b> rodents; passive immunization should be added to the vaccine after <b>bites</b> <b>by</b> wild animals in enzootic areas, while <b>bites</b> <b>by</b> cats and dogs, even uncaptured, will not be necessarily followed by vaccination in non enzootic areas...|$|R
50|$|There is {{very little}} {{information}} available for bite symptoms. Human <b>bites</b> <b>by</b> the tiger rattlesnake are infrequent, and literature available on <b>bites</b> <b>by</b> this snake is scarce. The several recorded human envenomations by tiger rattlesnakes produced little local pain, swelling, or other reaction following the bite, and despite the toxicity of its venom no significant systemic symptoms. The comparatively low venom yield (6.4-11 mg dried venom) and short 4.0 mm to 4.6 mm fangs of the tiger rattlesnake possibly prevent severe envenoming in adult humans. However, the clinical picture could be much more serious if the person bitten was a child or a slight build individual. The early therapeutic use of antivenom is important if significant envenomation is suspected. Despite the low venom yield, a <b>bite</b> <b>by</b> this rattlesnake {{should be considered a}} life-threatening medical emergency. Untreated mortality rate is unknown but this snake has a very high venom toxicity and its bites are capable of producing major envenomation.|$|R
