5000|$|The {{origins of}} Night Trap {{can be traced}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Scene</b> of the Crime, a 1986 {{prototype}} game developed by Axlon to demonstrate its planned entertainment system, code-named NEMO, to Hasbro executives. The system used VHS technology to present movie-like gaming experiences. With the system picked up by Hasbro, production of Night Trap began with a budget of 1.5 million. The video footage was recorded across 16 days in 1987. Among the actresses was Dana Plato, who was experiencing a decline in her career due to drug and alcohol troubles and a recent departure from the American sitcom Diff'rent Strokes. The game was set to debut with the now-dubbed [...] "Control-Vision" [...] system in early 1989, but Hasbro suddenly canceled the system release, citing high hardware costs. The Night Trap video footage was later purchased by executive producer Tom Zito who founded Digital Pictures, moving the project onto the Sega CD add-on for the Sega Genesis.|$|E

25|$|To {{increase}} {{the feeling of}} claustrophobia in Sunshine, Boyle refused <b>to</b> cut <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>scenes</b> on Earth, a traditional technique in most films about the planet in jeopardy. The director also maintained an atmosphere of confinement in Sunshine by avoiding filming the primary ship, Icarus II, from the outside. There {{are only a few}} outside shots of the ship. He also attempted to avoid filming star field backgrounds, keeping the ship's exterior pitch black, but he was ultimately compelled to show stars outside the spacecraft to help convey a sense of the ship's movement.|$|R

40|$|There {{have been}} more than 900 Shakespearean film adaptations of one kind or other, for screens large and small, dating <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>scenes</b> from Macbeth in 1898. The Stratford playwright would have become rich beyond the dreams of avarice from film rights alone; equally, though, I think he would have {{acknowledged}} that film-makers have notched up a pretty honourable record in bringing his plays to the cinema. Certainly, such screen versions have been essentially aimed at arthouse audiences, but he might well have been pleased at some of his successes among the groundlings. Think of Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet and how well it chimed with the youthful Zeitgeist in 1968...|$|R

60|$|Next {{moment he}} {{was out on the}} escape, and reached the ground amid ringing cheers.

50|$|In earlier manuscripts the {{recipient}} of the book may be a dead saint, the founder of a monastery or monastic order, for example, and the person handing over the book the abbot, or sometimes the scribe of the book. The genre is an extension of other forms of dedication portraits, for example wall-paintings or mosaics in churches showing the person who commissioned the church holding a model of it. Ultimately they stretch <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>scenes</b> where classical rulers receive tribute, or those where a procession of Early Christian martyrs carry their crowns to present Christ. The miniatures are often found in luxury books presented to the emperor or another major figure, which usually followed significant donations of land to the monastery concerned.|$|R

60|$|Two {{or three}} hours later he awoke, and leaving his house, crossed London Bridge, and wended his way <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the <b>scene</b> of the fire without any {{definite}} intention, but with savage desires in his breast.

25|$|On May 18 the {{government}} soldiers {{were preparing to}} cross the bridge and rebel gunners opened fire on them. The rebels then warned {{the government}} forces of the charges.

5000|$|In the San Francisco Examiner, Barbara Shulgasser said, [...] "Surprises {{are great}} when they {{retrospectively}} make sense. Even if you didn't anticipate them on first viewing, {{when you think}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> earlier <b>scenes</b> {{you can see how}} the author has prepared for the shocking events. Lucas just drops events into the action like non-sequiturs in conversation." ...|$|R
60|$|Arnold's memory flashed <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the <b>scene</b> {{which he}} had just left--to Isaac, the outcast, {{crouched}} beneath his barricade of furniture, waiting in the darkness with his loaded pistol and murder in his heart.
