5|$|In {{response}} to the new findings, the U.S. Navy, with Sandia's assistance, reopened the investigation. In August 1991, Sandia and the GAO completed their reports, concluding that the explosion was likely caused by an accidental overram of powder bags into the breech of the 16-inch gun. The U.S. Navy, however, disagreed with Sandia's opinion {{and concluded that the}} cause of the explosion could not be determined. The U.S. Navy expressed regret (<b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> apology) to Hartwig's family and closed its investigation.|$|E
5|$|The role {{of intent}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} and definitive elements of the karma theory, in all its traditions. In Jainism, intent is important <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> essential precondition of sin or wrong conduct. Evil intent forms only one of the modes of committing sin. Any action committed, knowingly or unknowingly, has karmic repercussions. In certain philosophies, like Buddhism, a person is guilty of violence only if he had an intention to commit violence. On the other hand, according to Jains, if an act produces violence, then the person is guilty of it, whether or not he had an intention to commit it.|$|E

5|$|In November 1967, the LDS Church asked Hugh Nibley, a {{professor}} of ancient scripture at Brigham Young University (BYU), to study the fragments. Nibley was a polyglot, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> Egyptologist, and subsequently studied under John A. Wilson {{in an attempt to}} learn enough about Egyptian hieroglyphics to translate them himself., he had begun to study Egyptian in Chicago with Dr. John A. Wilson". The LDS Church published sepia photographs of the papyri in its magazine Improvement Era in February 1968, although a translation was not provided at the time. The editors of an independent quarterly journal, , arranged for and published translations of the papyri courtesy of several Egyptologists and scholars, including: John A. Wilson (University of Chicago, Oriental Institute), Richard Anthony Parker (Director of the Department of Egyptology, Brown University), Klaus Baer (University of Chicago, Oriental Institute), and Jerald Tanner (independent scholar). Other translations and analyses have been performed at various times since 1968 by Mormon and non-Mormon scholars, including Michael D. Rhodes (BYU), John Gee (BYU), and Robert K. Ritner (University of Chicago).|$|E
5|$|The Congregation elected Vermigli abbot of {{the monastery}} at San Pietro ad Aram, Naples in 1537. There he became acquainted with Juan de Valdés, {{a leader of the}} spirituali movement. Valdés {{introduced}} Vermigli to the writings of Protestant reformers. Toward the end of his time in Naples, he read Martin Bucer's commentaries on the Gospels and the Psalms, and Zwingli's De vera et falsa religione. Reading these works was an act of ecclesiastical defiance, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> uncommon one in reformist circles. Vermigli seems to have slowly moved in a Protestant direction primarily through study of the Bible and the Church Fathers, especially Augustine. He probably read Protestant literature critically; it was common for those in reform-minded circles to do so while remaining in the Catholic Church. Vermigli embraced the Protestant doctrine of justification by faith alone during this time, and he had probably rejected the traditional Catholic view of the sacraments. Vermigli also seems to have influenced Valdés. Scholars believe that Valdés's strong doctrine of double predestination, that God has chosen some people for salvation and others for damnation, was learned from Vermigli. Vermigli in turn had acquired it from his study of Gregory of Rimini at Padua.|$|E
