The $519 million master plan will replace the existing terminals with a new 20-gate concourse and expanded baggage facilities.

The airport is served by Air Canada from Vancouver International Airport (YVR).|$|E

This led the passenger numbers on the line to decline from 20,000 in 1914 to just 3,000 yearly when passenger services were entirely cancelled on 29 January 1939.|$|E

25|$|The {{line between}} Møhlenpris and Torgallmenningen was created when line 2 was split in 1919. After some time, the city centre {{terminus}} {{was moved to}} Ole Bulls plass. After numerous changes, in 1923 it was extended to Tyskebryggen ("the German Dock"). In 1950, the line was replaced by Bergen's first trolleybus line, which ran along through the new street from Dokken to Nøstet, not along the tram line from Møhlenpris over Nygårdshøyden to the city centre. It continued to Bryggen and Mulen, where it replaced the bus route from Nøstet to Mulen. This bus section was replaced by diesel bus in 1994 as it was started to build a western approach and split into two different lines, 5 Mulen-Solheimslien and 11 Møhlenpris-Nygårdshøyden-Starefossen. In connection with another restructuring the line 11 had its route changed to Nordnes instead of Møhlenpris, and Southern Møhlenpris lost its <b>bus</b> <b>connection</b> in 2000. The stretch between Møhlenpris and Engen is still in operation as a museum tram.|$|E
