If b is the <b>Burger</b> <b>vector</b> of a dislocation loop and g is the diffraction vector, dislocation loop will appear larger, smaller or disappear for g. b> 0, g. b< 0 or g. b= 0, respectively. Dislocation loop was determined as follows – first, the appearance of dislocation loops is arranged in observation table. Second, based on type of dislocation loop, <b>Burger</b> <b>vector</b> and diffraction vector, appearance of dislocation loop is arranged in calculation table. Third, based on observation and calculation table, <b>Burger</b> <b>vector</b> and type of dislocation loop is determined. The results show that dislocation loops consist of perfect dislocation loops and Frank dislocation loops.

It appears from observations of plastically deformed ferrite single crystals that resulting dislocation density is still low in both investigated specimens (nickel ferrite and YIG). In YIG it is shown that plastic deformation involves dislocations with both a and a/ 2 Burgers vectors; dislocation loops with a/ 2 <b>Burgers</b> <b>vectors</b> are also present. In nickel ferrite numerous slices with hexagonal structure together with simple stacking fault or sub-grain boundaries are found depending on test temperature, in this compound isolated dislocations always have a/ 2 <b>Burgers</b> <b>vectors</b> and are often dissociated into two partials with collinear <b>Burgers</b> <b>vectors...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Dislocations do {{not have}} random {{structure}}s, the local atomic structure of a dislocation {{is determined by the}} <b>Burgers</b> <b>vector.</b> One very useful application of the TEM in dislocation imaging is the ability to experimentally determine the <b>Burgers</b> <b>vector.</b> Determination of the <b>Burgers</b> <b>vector</b> is achieved by what is known as [...] ("g dot b") analysis. When performing dark field microscopy with the TEM, a diffracted spot is selected to form the image (as mentioned before, lattice planes diffract the beam into spots), and the image is formed using only electrons that were diffracted by the plane responsible for that diffraction spot. The vector in the diffraction pattern from the transmitted spot to the diffracted spot is the [...] vector. Without going into the finer points of electron microcopy; the contrast of a dislocation is scaled by a factor of the dot product of this vector and the <b>Burgers</b> <b>vector</b> (...) [...] As a result, if the <b>burgers</b> <b>vector</b> and [...] vector are perpendicular, there will be no signal from the dislocation and the dislocation will not appear at all in the image. Therefore, by examining different dark field images formed from spots with different g vectors, the <b>burgers</b> <b>vector</b> can be determined.|$|E

50|$|Dislocations {{can slip}} in planes {{containing}} both the dislocation {{line and the}} <b>Burgers</b> <b>vector.</b> For a screw dislocation, the dislocation line and the <b>Burgers</b> <b>vector</b> are parallel, so the dislocation may slip in any plane containing the dislocation. For an edge dislocation, the dislocation and the <b>Burgers</b> <b>vector</b> are perpendicular, so {{there is only one}} plane in which the dislocation can slip. There is an alternative mechanism of dislocation motion, fundamentally different from slip, that allows an edge dislocation to move out of its slip plane, known as dislocation climb. Dislocation climb allows an edge dislocation to move perpendicular to its slip plane. A creep mechanism involving only dislocation climb, also known as Harper-Dorn creep, can occur under certain conditions.|$|E
