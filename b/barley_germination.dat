The bacterium-to-plant signal, lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs) or Nod factors, are {{of great}} importance for roots organogenesis and hence, nodule formation and N fixation. Hence, we hypothesized that LCOs like gibberellins may also enhance barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) germination. The objectives were to test the effects of gibberellins on <b>barley</b> <b>germination</b> and {{to test the hypothesis}} that LCOs may increase seed germination in barley. The concentrations, tested were 10 - 5 M for gibberellins and 10 - 6 M and 10 - 7 and 10 - 8 M LCOs. Although, gibberellins were able to numerically increase <b>barley</b> <b>germination</b> (up to 18 %), the LCOs seemed to be more effective on <b>barley</b> <b>germination</b> as they significantly increased seed germination (up to 44 %). Hence, the novel finding indicates that for LCOs may also be very effective on barley seed germination, through inducing morphogenesis and physiological changes in seeds.

However, questions remain regarding {{the role and}} production mechanism of ROS in seed germination. Here, we focused on NADPH oxidases, which produce ROS. After imbibition, NADPH oxidase mRNAs were expressed in the embryo and in aleurone cells of barley seed; these expression sites {{were consistent with the}} sites of ROS production in the seed after imbibition. To clarify the role of NADPH oxidases in <b>barley</b> seed <b>germination,</b> we examined gibberellic acid (GA) / abscisic acid (ABA) metabolism and signaling in barley seeds treated with diphenylene iodonium chloride (DPI), an NADPH oxidase inhibitor. DPI significantly suppressed germination, and suppressed GA biosynthesis and ABA catabolism in embryos. GA, but not ABA, induced NADPH oxidase activity in aleurone cells. Additionally, DPI suppressed the early induction of α-amylase by GA in aleurone cells. These results suggest that ROS produced by NADPH oxidases promote GA biosynthesis in embryos, that GA induces and activates NADPH oxidases in aleurone cells, and that ROS produced by NADPH oxidases induce α-amylase in aleurone cells. We conclude that the ROS generated by NADPH oxidases regulate <b>barley</b> seed <b>germination</b> through GA / ABA metabolism and signaling in embryo and aleurone cells...|$|R

In this paper were conducted laboratory researches to determine the optimum working regime for obtaining malt from barley. The research was conducted in the laboratory, which {{is equipped with a}} Jacobsen germination machine, which helped in projecting and realizing different work methods in obtaining green malt. In the experiments performed were considered different working conditions for germination of barley, such as measurement and monitoring of time, water level and water temperature in the tank for soaking and germination of barley. Thus, <b>barley</b> <b>germination</b> humidity ranged from 14 % to 52 % and temperature of 14 o C to 25 o C, which allowed the establishment of working diagram families, and under their influence were obtained different times for germination of barley.

40|$|A Long Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (LongSAGE) {{approach}} {{was employed to}} identify changes in mRNA transcript abundance in a time course of malting barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Statistical analyses confidently identified 57 LongSAGE sequence tags as having significant changes in abundance between points in the time course. Eight of the genes which correspond to these tags were targeted for validation by relative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) analysis. Each gene was analysed by SYBR® Green detection in grain sampled at each of four time points from dry seed to grain germinated to 120 h post-steeping. Among the genes examined are alpha-amylase type B, a key starch degrading enzyme involved in germination (1 - 3, 1 - 4) -beta-d-glucanase, the major cell wall degrading enzyme, and cysteine proteinase EP-B, an important enzyme of proteolysis in <b>barley</b> seed <b>germination.</b> These three transcripts show significant up-regulation at 48 h post-steeping and remain significantly elevated throughout malting. These results provide transcriptional data to support the {{understanding of how the}} relative rates of protein and carbohydrate modification contribute to malting and brewing. mRNA abundance levels observed using real-time RT-PCR show good correlation with the data obtained from the LongSAGE study.

40|$|Malt is {{produced}} by the controlled, but limited germination of barley. To produce good quality malt, the barley employed {{must be able to}} germinate rapidly and synchronously. Dormancy is a seed characteristic that can interfere with the rapid and uniform germination of barley, thereby reducing the resultant malt quality. Various studies have shown that post harvest storage can be used to remove dormancy and enhance <b>barley</b> <b>germination</b> characteristics and malt quality. Because of its complexity, the fundamental basis of dormancy induction, maintenance and termination remain unknown. Glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PDH) is the rate limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway and has been associated with dormancy decay and increased seed vigor of a variety of different seeds. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if changes in <b>barley</b> <b>germination</b> vigour were associated with respiration and/or G 6 PDH changes during malting. Commercially grown barley (cv.

The germinative energy (GE) and germinative index (GI) of these samples were measured. Samples were micro-malted and the ?-amylase activity, respiration rate, and G 6 PDH activity of the germinating grains were measured at various stages of malting.

40|$|Abstract Background Seed {{germination}} is {{a complex}} multi-stage developmental process, and mainly accomplished through concerted activities of many gene products and biological pathways that are often subjected to strict developmental regulation. Gibberellins (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) are two key phytohormones regulating seed germination and seedling growth. However, transcriptional regulatory networks underlying seed germination and its associated biological pathways are largely unknown. Results The studies examined transcriptomes of barley representing six distinct and well characterized germination stages and revealed that the transcriptional regulatory program underlying <b>barley</b> <b>germination</b> was composed of early, late, and post-germination phases. Each phase was accompanied with transcriptional up-regulation of distinct biological pathways. Cell wall synthesis and regulatory components including transcription factors, signaling and post-translational modification components were specifically and transiently up-regulated in early germination phase while histone families and many metabolic pathways were up-regulated in late germination phase. Photosynthesis and seed reserve mobilization pathways were up-regulated in post-germination phase. However, stress related pathways and seed storage proteins were suppressed through the entire course of germination. A set of genes were transiently up-regulated within three hours of imbibition, and might play roles in initiating biological pathways involved in seed germination. However, highly abundant transcripts in dry barley and Arabidopsis seeds were significantly conserved. Comparison with transcriptomes of barley aleurone in response to GA and ABA identified three sets of germination responsive genes that were regulated coordinately by GA, antagonistically by ABA, and coordinately by GA but antagonistically by ABA. Major CHO metabolism, cell wall degradation and protein degradation pathways were up-regulated by both GA and seed germination. Those genes and metabolic pathways {{are likely to be}} important parts of transcriptional regulatory networks underlying GA and ABA regulation of seed germination and seedling growth. Conclusions The studies developed a model depicting transcriptional regulatory programs underlying <b>barley</b> <b>germination</b> and GA and ABA regulation of germination at gene, pathway and systems levels, and established a standard transcriptome reference for further integration with various -omics and biological data to illustrate biological networks underlying seed germination. The studies also generated a great amount of systems biological evidence for previously proposed hypotheses, and developed a number of new hypotheses on transcriptional regulation of seed germination for further experimental validation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Hydrolysis {{of barley}} {{proteins}} into peptides and amino acids {{is one of}} the most important processes during <b>barley</b> <b>germination.</b> The degradation of the endosperm stored proteins facilitates water and enzyme movements, enhances modification, liberates starch granules and increases soluble amino nitrogen. Protease activity is the result of the activities of a mixture of exo- and endo-proteases. The barley proteins are initially solubilized by endo-proteases and the further by exo-proteases. Four classes of endo-proteases have been described: serine-proteases, cysteine-proteases, aspartic-proteases and metallo-proteases. The objective of this work was to develop a rapid and colorimetric enzymatic assay to determine the endo-proteolytic activity of the four endo-protease classes using two different substrates: azo-gelatin and azo-casein. Optimum conditions for the assays such as: pH,reaction time and temperature and absorbance scale were determined. Azo-gelatin presented several difficulties in standardizing an “in solution” assay.

In this study, we characterize the entire cystatin gene family from barley (Hordeum vulgare), which contain 13 nonredundant genes, and identify and characterize their target enzymes, the barley cathepsin L-like proteases. Cystatins and proteases were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli cultures. Each cystatin {{was found to have}} different inhibitory capability against barley cysteine-proteases in in vitro inhibitory assays using specific substrates. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that inhibitors and enzymes present a wide variation in their messenger RNA expression patterns.

Subcellular localization of cystatins and cathepsin L-like proteases fused to green fluorescent protein demonstrated the presence of both protein families throughout the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex. Proteases and cystatins not only colocalized but also interacted in vivo in the plant cell, as revealed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation. The functional relationship between cystatins and cathepsin L-like proteases was inferred from their common implication as counterparts of mobilization of storage proteins upon <b>barley</b> seed <b>germination.</b> The opposite pattern of transcription expression in gibberellin-treated aleurones presented by inhibitors and enzymes allowed proteases to specifically degrade B, C, and D hordeins stored in the endosperm of barley seeds...|$|R

This study will enhance {{our understanding of the}} role of microorganisms in the <b>barley</b> <b>germination</b> process. In addition, this study may provide a basis for microflora management during malting. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{processes}} of barley plant development, various endo- and exopeptidases are involved. To determine {{the type and}} number of aminopeptidases that could participate in <b>barley</b> seed <b>germination</b> and tissue growth, their activities in extracts of non-germinated and germinated barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Angora) grains and young tissues have been examined, {{and some of their}} properties determined. Aminopeptidases (AP) hydrolysing 2 -naphthylamides of various amino acids were present in dry and germinated grains, roots, seedlings and leaves, showing preferences for amino acids phenylalanine (Phe), arginine (Arg), leucine (Leu) and methionine (Met), and lower activity towards alanine (Ala), proline (Pro), glycine (Gly) and histidine (His). Levels and ratios of AP activities changed during germination and tissue development, indicating that APs of different specificities are required at different stages of germination and in young tissues. Thus, the increase of all aminopeptidase activities during the first 24 hours of germination and subsequent decrease show significant involvement in seed primary metabolism restoration. The activities of Arg- and HisAP are equally important in green malt. Seedlings and leaves have pronounced substrate specificity for Phe, Leu, Ala and Pro, while roots have the lowest AP specific activities. From the activities and determined properties, the presence of at least six aminopeptidases optimally active at pH= 7. 4 – 8. 2 could be discerned in dry and germinated grains, and young tissues of Angora barley. Two aminopeptidases are most probably of broad substrate specificity, three show narrow preference with dominating Leu, Phe, or Pro/His, while one is specific for Arg...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of large-scale gene expression {{technologies such as}} serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) has provided the tools to significantly {{increase the amount of}} genetic data available. To characterise the transcriptional profile of grain during the malting process, eight LongSAGE libraries from Barley var. Tallon were constructed. One library was constructed from mature un-steeped seed and seven libraries were generated from barley grain at specific time points during malting, 0, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours post steeping. A total of 155, 206 LongSAGE tags, representing 41, 909 different tags, were analysed. The one hundred most abundant tags from each library were examined in more depth to identify the putative functional role of highly abundant transcripts in <b>barley</b> seed <b>germination.</b> The largest functional groups include transcripts coding for stress response and cell defense, protein synthesis and storage proteins. Statistical analyses were implemented to determine which tags demonstrate significant differential expression across time. Eight of these genes were targeted for analysis by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. Alpha-amylase, (1 - 3, 1 - 4) -beta-D-glucanase, Cysteine proteinase and Isocitrate lyase show the most significant changes and are up-regulated between 12 and 48 hours post steeping and except for Isocitrate lyase, remain high until 96 hours post steeping. The gene expression patterns observed by real-time PCR show strong correlations with the expression levels identified by LongSAGE analysis for the same genes. This confirms the level of sensitivity able to be detected with SAGE technology and provides greater confidence in the data obtainable by high-throughput gene expression techniques...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Barley {{alpha-amylase}} is a 45 kDa enzyme {{which is}} involved in starch degradation during <b>barley</b> seed <b>germination.</b> The released sugars provide the plant embryo with energy for growth. The major barley alpha-amylase isozyme (AMY 2) binds with high affinity to the endogenous inhibitor BASI (barley alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitor) whereas the minor isozyme (AMY 1) is not inhibited. BASI is a 19. 6 kDa bifunctional protein that can simultaneously inhibit AMY 2 and serine proteases of the subtilisin family. This inhibitor may therefore prevent degradation of the endosperm starch during premature sprouting and protect the seed from attack by pathogens secreting proteases. RESULTS: The crystal structure of AMY 2 in complex with BASI was determined and refined at 1. 9 A resolution. BASI consists of a 12 -stranded beta-barrel structure which belongs to the beta-trefoil fold family and inhibits AMY 2 by sterically occluding access of the substrate to the active site of the enzyme. The AMY 2 -BASI complex is characterized by an unusual completely solvated calcium ion located at the protein-protein interface. CONCLUSIONS: The AMY 2 -BASI complex represents the first reported structure of an endogenous protein-protein complex from a higher plant. The structure of the complex throws light on the strict specificity of BASI for AMY 2, and shows that domain B of AMY 2 contributes greatly to the specificity of enzyme-inhibitor recognition. In contrast to the three-dimensional structures of porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase in complex with proteinaceous inhibitors, the AMY 2 -BASI structure reveals that the catalytically essential amino acid residues of the enzyme are not directly bound to the inhibitor. Binding of BASI to AMY 2 creates a cavity, exposed to the external medium, that is ideally shaped to accommodate an extra calcium ion. This feature {{may contribute to the}} inhibitory effect, as the key amino acid sidechains of the active site are in direct contact with water molecules which are in turn ligated to the calcium ion.
