50|$|Arri {{standard}} is a lens mount developed by Arri {{for use with}} both 16 mm and 35 mm movie cameras. Lenses are distinguished by a tab inside an outer ring. Because of the weak seating strength and ability of the aluminum mount to gradually become poorly seated, the stainless steel Arri <b>bayonet</b> <b>mount</b> superseded the Arri standard mount in 1965, debuting on the 16BL. However, cameras with the <b>bayonet</b> <b>mount</b> are also able to accommodate Arri standard lenses due to both mounts having the same flange focal distance and diameter. Unfortunately, cameras with Arri standard mounts are unable to fit lenses with Arri <b>bayonet</b> <b>mounts,</b> due to the <b>bayonet</b> <b>mount's</b> locking mechanism.|$|R

5000|$|On 11 August, Marie-Jeanne Valet and {{her younger}} sister were {{attacked}} while fording {{a tributary of the}} River Desges, on the road from Paulhac-en-Margeride to Broussous. Valet successfully defended herself and her sister with a <b>bayonet</b> <b>mounted</b> {{at the end of a}} staff, wounding the Beast, which threw itself into the river and thrashed about madly before escaping. Antoine and company quickly made their way to Paulhac when they heard of this event, praising Marie-Jeanne for her bravery. The Royal Gunbearer compared her favourably to Joan of Arc, calling her the [...] "Maid of the Gévaudan." [...] Unconvinced that the Beast had been wounded to the death, however, he remained in the field. Writing to M. Saint-Priest, Antoine respectfully requested if a monetary reward for Marie-Jeanne Valet would be forthcoming. [...] "By the way", he added, [...] "I have sent to the royal kennels for help, just in case the Beast is not dead. While awaiting the arrival of this help, we shall gather all our strength and our wits to finish thereby the tragedy whose sad enactment has gone on too long." ...|$|E

5000|$|Arri bayonet is a {{lens mount}} {{developed}} by Arri {{for use with}} both 16 mm and 35 mm movie camera lenses. Lenses of this type are distinguished by [...] "outer wings" [...] which both control aperture and bayonet alignment, and are placed in the mount while two pressure tabs are simultaneously depressed {{at the side of}} the lens mount on the camera. These tabs provide a relatively strong locking mechanism which allows for higher quality lens seating than offered by the Arri standard mount. Debuting in 1965 with the 16BL, the Arri <b>bayonet</b> <b>mount</b> superseded the Arri standard mount, but cameras with the <b>bayonet</b> <b>mount</b> were also able to accommodate Arri standard lenses due to both mounts having the same flange focal distance and diameter. However, cameras with Arri standard mounts were unable to fit lenses with Arri <b>bayonet</b> <b>mounts,</b> due to the locking mechanism. The <b>bayonet</b> <b>mount</b> began to be superseded around 1980 by the Arri PL mount, which has since become an overwhelmingly predominant mount for most modern cameras, along with Panavision and their PV mount.|$|R

The backup current limiting fuse operates only during transformer failure, therefore it is not field replaceable. These transformers also serve the conventional low voltage fusing requirements.|$|R
