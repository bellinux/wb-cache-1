The system laid out in 0. 35 μm CMOS technology occupies 0. 78 mm 2 core area and consumes 30 μW of power from a 3 V supply. A <b>buffer</b> <b>driver</b> stage is added which consumes 150 μW.

One prominent technique is the approach of sizing wires for long interconnects to achieve the desired speed and power characteristics [1 - 4]. It has also been suggested that one may appropriately insert repeaters [5] for significant delay reductions. This paper unifies these approaches to optimizing an interconnect by placing a prespecified number of <b>buffers</b> (<b>drivers</b> and repeaters) using a dynamic programming procedure and then performing simultaneous wire and buffer sizing using a sensitivity-based heuristic.

40|$|On-chip {{communication}} {{is becoming an}} important bottleneck {{in the design and}} operation of high performance systems where it has to face additional challenges due to device variability. Communication structures such as tapered <b>buffer</b> <b>drivers,</b> interconnects, repeaters, and data storage elements are vulnerable to variability, which can limit the performance of the on-chip communication networks. In this regard, it becomes important to have a complete understanding of the impact that variability will have on the performance of these circuit elements in order to design high yield and reliable systems. In this paper, the authors have characterized the performance of the communication structures under the impact of random dopant fluctuation (RDF) for the future technology generations of 25, 18, and 13 nm. For accurate characterization of their performance, a Monte Carlo simulation method has been used along with predictive device models for the given technologies. Analytical models have been developed for the link failure probability of a repeater inserted interconnect which uses characterization data of all communication structures to give an accurate prediction of the link failure probability.

Because of parameter variations from site-to-site in the wafer, ECL compatibility of source coupled FET logic circuits, {{in terms of}} voltage levels and clock duty cycle, was very poor and therefore the electrical yield was very low. A source coupled FET logic <b>buffer</b> <b>driver</b> was designed to make the Gallium Arsenide ECL cell more resistant to parameter variations and consequently, the yield is highly improved.

40|$|The Port Card {{will be one}} link in {{the data}} {{acquisition}} system for the D 0 Silicon Vertex Detector. This system consists of the following parts, starting at the detector: Silicon strip detectors are mounted in a spaceframe and wire-bonded to custom bare-die integrated circuits (SVX-II chips) that digitize the charge collected by the strips. The 128 -channel chips are mounted on a High-Density Interconnect (HDI) that consists of a small flex circuit that routes control signals and eight data bits for each of three to ten chips onto a common data bus. A cable then routes this bus approximately thirty feet out from the detector to the Port Card. The Port Card houses a commercial chipset that serializes the data in real time and converts the signal into laser light impulses that are then transmitted through a multi-mode optical fiber about 150 feet to a Silicon Acquisition & Readout board (SAR). Here, the data is transformed back to parallel electrical signals that are stored in one of several banks of FIFO memories. The FIFOs place their data onto the VME backplane to a VME <b>Buffer</b> <b>Driver</b> (VBD) which stores the event data in buffers for eventual readout over a thirty-two signal ribbon cable to the Level Two Computers and subsequent tape storage. Control and sequencing of the whole operation starts with the Silicon Acquisition/Readout Controller (SARC) working {{in tandem with the}} D 0 Clock System. The SARC resides in the same VME crate as the SARs, and transforms signals from the Trigger System into control codes distributed to the various Port Cards via optical fibers operating at 53 Mb/s. It is through these control codes that data taking operations such as data-acquisition, digitization, readout, and various resets can be carried out. The Port Card receives the control codes and manipulates the SVX-II chips in the proper way to effect proper data taking. There will be a total of about 700, 000 channels, which translates into about 5580 SVX-II chips, 66 to 100 Port Cards, 66 to 100 SARs, and four to eight SARCs...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Currently, the {{two most}} {{critical}} factors of microprocessor design are performance and power. The optimum balance of these two factors {{is reflected in the}} speed-power product(SPP). 32 -bit CMOS adders are used as representative circuits to investigate a method of reducing the SPP. The purpose of this thesis is to show that sizing gates according to fan-out and removing <b>buffer</b> <b>drivers</b> can reduce the SPP. This thesis presents a method for sizing gates in large fan-out parallel prefix circuits to reduce the SPP and compares it to other methods. Three different parallel prefix adders are used to compare propagation delay and SPP. The first adder uses the depth-optimal prefix circuit. The second adder is based on Wei, Thompson, and Chen's time-optimal adder. The third adder uses a recursive doubling formation where all cells have minimum transistor width dimensions. The component cells in the adders are static CMOS as described by Brent and Kung. For all circuits, the smallest propagation delay occurs when the highest voltage supply is applied. The smallest SPP occurs when the lowest voltage supply is applied, but with the lowest performance. The Recursive Doubling Adder always has the lowest propagation delay for a particular set of parameters. However, its SPP is nearly equal to the Brent-Kung Adders and lower than Wei's Adder. The power-frequency analysis reveals that a decrease in Vt causes higher power consumption due to leakage...|$|R

40|$|To achieve {{timing closure}} in a placed design, <b>buffer</b> {{insertion}} and <b>driver</b> sizing {{are two of}} the most effective transforms that can be applied. Since the driver sizing solution and the buffer insertion solution affect each other, sub-optimal solutions may result if these techniques are applied sequentially instead of simultaneously. We show how to simply extend van Ginneken’s buffer insertion algorithm to simultaneously incorporate driver sizing and introduce the idea of a delay penalty to encapsulate the effect of driver sizing on the previous stage. The delay penalty can be pre-computed efficiently via dynamic programming. Experimental results show that using driver sizing with a delay penalty function obtains designs with superior timing and area characteristics. ...|$|R

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{performance}} of critical nets where both timing and wire resources are stringent, we integrate <b>buffer</b> insertion and <b>driver</b> sizing separately with non-Hanan optimization and propose two algorithms: BINO (simultaneous Buffer Insertion and Non-Hanan Optimization) and FAR-DS (Full-plane AWE Routing with Driver Sizing). For BINO, we consider the realistic situation that buffer locations are restricted to a limited set of available spaces after cell placement. The objective of BINO is to minimize a weighted sum of wire and buffer costs subject to timing constraints. To achieve this objective, we suggest a greedy algorithm that considers two operations independently: iterative buffer insertion and iterative buffer deletion. Both are conducted simultaneously with nonHanan optimization until the improvement is exhausted. For FAR-DS, we investigate the curvature property of the sink delay {{as a function of}} both connection location and driver stage ratio in a twodimensional space. The objective of FAR-DS is to minimize a weighted sum of wire and driver cost while ensuring that the timing constraints are satisfied. Based on the curvature property,we search for the optimal solution in the continuous two-dimensional space.

40|$|The {{goal of the}} Modular Weapon Control Unit (MWCU) {{program was}} to design and develop a {{reconfigurable}} weapon controller (programmer/sequencer) that {{can be adapted to}} different weapon systems based on the particular requirements for that system. Programmers from previous systems are conceptually the same and perform similar tasks. Because of this commonality and the amount of re-engineering necessary with the advent of every new design, the idea of a modular, adaptable system has emerged. Also, the controller can be used in more than one application for a specific weapon system. Functionality has been divided into a Processor Module (PM) and an Input/Output Module (IOM). The PM will handle all operations that require calculations, memory, and timing. The IOM will handle interfaces {{to the rest of the}} system, input level shifting, output drive capability, and detection of interrupt conditions. Configuration flexibility is achieved in two ways.

40|$|The {{integrated}} circuit (IC) packaging electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) /signal integrity (SI) /power integrity (PI) {{problems have been}} broadly attested. But IC packaging electromagnetic interference (EMI) was seldom addressed. Because the electromagnetic emission from IC packagings becomes more critical as the data rate of digital system continues increasing. Its working mechanism and modeling technology are very important. In this thesis, EM emission behaviors of IC packaging are systematically studied for the first time. It was never seen from other literatures. The fundamental principles and properties of electromagnetic radiations caused by heat sinks, vias, traces, and pin maps in IC packaging structures are carefully investigated and modeled. Both theoretical analysis based on first principles and simulated results based on numerical full wave solvers are provided to find out critical impact factors to IC packaging EMI. This work establishes basic modeling components for comprehensive radiation studies. It directly benefits fundamental understandings and guideline development for the optimization of the packaging EMI reduction. Some measurement results are also included to support concluded characterizations and analysis. A summary for IC packaging EMI design rules is discussed in details to conclude the derived design guidelines. Second, a novel data pattern based electromagnetic superposition method is developed to model the IC packaging electromagnetic emission. It employs the equivalence principle to obtain the electromagnetic field response over a broad spectrum. Then it uses the linear property of the passive parasitic system to superimpose the contribution of different signals on the packaging. As a result, with certain pre-calculations, it is convenient to compute the electromagnetic emission efficiently from different signals with various signal pattern combinations, which benefits identifying the worst case scenario. The proposed method can be implemented between different tools for specific purposes. In addition, data reconstruction can be evaluated through the phase shift, and it benefits identifying the EMI of any pulse bit pattern. This work offers great convenience for the post-processing, and allows the flexibility of real digital pulse signals. It provides a basic modeling framework for comprehensive radiation studies for IC packaging and PCB EMI reductions. Third, the performance of IC interconnects has been stretched tremendously in recently years by high speed IC systems. Their EM emission and SI modelings {{have to consider the}} existence of I/O active devices, such as <b>buffers</b> and <b>drivers.</b> The I/O model is difficult to obtain due to the IP protection and limited information. We proposed to use the X-parameter to model the IC interconnect system. Based on the PHD formalism, X-parameter models provide an accurate frequency-domain method under large-signal operating points to characterize their nonlinear behaviors. Starting from modeling the CMOS inverter, the whole link modeling primarily based on X-parameter for the pulse digital signals was presented. I/O modeling can also be investigated by the proposed new method to understand the impedance effects at high speed serial links. It is the first complete examination of the X-parameter to IC interconnect SI analysis. The nonlinear I/O property represented by IBIS models is also investigated to model its impact to IC packaging EMI.

40|$|Technology scaling has {{increased}} the transistor 2 ̆ 7 s susceptibility to process variations in nanometer very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits. The effects of such variations are having {{a huge impact on}} performance and hence the timing yield of the integrated circuits. The circuit optimization objectives namely power, area, and delay are highly correlated and conflicting in nature. The inception of variations in process parameters have made their relationship intricate and more difficult to optimize. Traditional deterministic methods ignoring variation effects negatively impacts timing yield. A pessimistic worst case consideration of variations, on the other hand, can lead to severe over design. In this context, there is a strong need for re-invention of circuit optimization methods with a statistical perspective. In this dissertation, we model and develop novel variation aware solutions for circuit optimization methods such as gate sizing, timing based placement and buffer insertion. The uncertainty due to process variations is modeled using interval valued fuzzy numbers and a fuzzy programming based optimization is proposed to improve circuit yield without significant over design. In addition to the statistical optimization methods, we have proposed a novel technique that dynamically detects and creates the slack needed to accommodate the delay due to variations. The variation aware gate sizing technique is formulated as a fuzzy linear program and the uncertainty in delay due to process variations is modeled using fuzzy membership functions. The timing based placement technique, on the other hand, due to its quadratic dependence on wire length is modeled as nonlinear programming problem. The variations in timing based placement are modeled as fuzzy numbers in the fuzzy formulation and as chance constraints in the stochastic formulation. Further, we have proposed a piece-wise linear formulation for the variation aware <b>buffer</b> insertion and <b>driver</b> sizing (BIDS) problem. The BIDS problem is solved at the logic level, with look-up table based approximation of net lengths for early variation awareness. In the context of dynamic variation compensation, a delay detection circuit is used to identify the uncertainty in critical path delay. The delay detection circuit controls the instance of data capture in critical path memory flops to avoid a timing failure in the presence of variations. In summary, the various formulation and solution techniques developed in this dissertation achieve significantly better optimization compared to related works in the literature. The proposed methods have been rigorously tested on medium and large sized benchmarks to establish the validity and efficacy of the solution techniques...|$|R
