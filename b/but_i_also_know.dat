500|$|Marge is a caring, understanding, and {{nurturing}} parent to Bart, but {{she refers to}} him as [...] "a handful" [...] and is often embarrassed by his antics. In [...] "Marge Be Not Proud" [...] (season seven, 1995), {{she felt she was}} mothering Bart too much and started acting more distant towards him after he was caught shoplifting. In the beginning of the episode, Bart protested her [...] "over-mothering", but as she started acting more distant towards him, he felt guilty about it and made up with her. Marge has expressed understanding for her [...] "special little guy" [...] and has defended him on many occasions. She once said [...] "I know Bart can be a handful, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> what he's like inside. He's got a spark. It's not a bad thing... Of course, it makes him do bad things." [...] Marge has a good relationship with Lisa and the two are shown to get along quite well. Marge over-mothers Maggie, which causes her to become too clingy and dependent on Marge. In [...] "A Streetcar Named Marge" [...] (season four, 1992) When Marge was playing the role of Blanche DuBois, she hit Ned Flanders naked with a bottle and she tells him 'What's this bottle in your face!'.|$|E
500|$|Due to Bart's mischievousness and Homer's often uncaring and incompetent behavior, the {{two have}} a {{turbulent}} relationship. Bart regularly addresses Homer by his given name instead of [...] "Dad", while Homer in turn often refers to him as [...] "the boy". Homer has a short temper and when enraged by Bart will strangle him on impulse in a cartoonishly violent manner. One of the original ideas for the show was that Homer would be [...] "very angry" [...] and oppressive toward Bart, but these characteristics were toned down somewhat as their characters were explored. Marge {{is a much more}} caring, understanding and nurturing parent than Homer, but she also refers to Bart as [...] "a handful" [...] and is often embarrassed by his antics. In [...] "Marge Be Not Proud", (season seven, 1995) she felt she was mothering Bart too much and began acting more distant towards him after he was caught shoplifting. At the beginning of the episode, Bart protested at her over-mothering but as her attitude changed, he felt bad and made it up to her. Despite his attitude, Bart is sometimes willing to experience humiliation if it means pleasing his mom. Marge has expressed an understanding for her [...] "special little guy" [...] and has defended him on many occasions. She once said [...] "I know Bart can be a handful, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> what he's like inside. He's got a spark. It's not a bad thing... Of course, it makes him do bad things." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the vault}} final, Maroney won {{a silver medal}} with a score of 15.083. She {{performed}} an Amanar for her first vault but fell on her second. This fall ended her 33-vault hitting streak in competition. Even with the fall, Maroney still came in second. She said, [...] "I didn't get my full block, my hands didn't really touch the vault. I still walked out with a silver medal and I'm happy about that. I'll have to watch the video {{and figure out what}} happened. It's really sad that I had to fall on that vault but I'm glad I won a silver medal. I know I can do better vaults <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> I didn't deserve the gold medal because I fell on my second vault. It happens. It's gymnastics. You can't always be perfect. Sometimes things don't go as planned." ...|$|E

5000|$|Growing up in Harlem, Baldwin faced many obstacles, one {{of which}} was his education. When {{discussing}} how he got out he said, [...] "I knew I was black, of course, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was smart. I didn't know how I would use my mind, or even if <b>I</b> could, <b>but</b> that was the only thing I had to use." [...] (O'Reilly) [...] "Baldwin attended P.S. 24 on 128th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues in Harlem, where he wrote the school song, which was used until the school closed down.|$|R

[...] Lorne Lanning ...|$|R
2500|$|The music {{industry}} suggested that iPods {{have a substantial}} and legitimate commercial use in contrast to Grokster, to which Souter replied, [...] "I know perfectly well that I can buy a CD {{and put it on}} my iPod. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> if I can get music without buying it, I'm going to do so." [...] On the other hand, the justices seemed troubled at the prospect of ruling that Grokster's alleged business model of actively inducing infringement and then reaping the commercial benefits was shielded from liability. Grokster argued that affirming the Ninth Circuit would only prevent an injunction against future use of the P2P software, while the plaintiffs would still be free to pursue damages in the district court for alleged past wrongful acts. Much of the Court, however, expressed skepticism that Grokster's continuing enterprise could be severable from the consequences of those prior acts.|$|E

The fight jumped toward us pretty quick, you remember, and while I sat at the wheel the bullet came. I knew when it hit me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> could move my arm, so what did it matter? I told myself to wait till {{we got to the}} ship. Had we stayed there longer, we might all have stopped bullets--and some bullets might have stopped us."

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Lim {{spent a few}} years in Los Angeles, landing roles in Off Limits (1988) and It Could Happen to You (1994). He found the city [...] "very {{cutthroat}} and very fake. I didn't like the obsession with showbiz there. It wasn't like living a normal life in a normal city. I knew it was tough before <b>I</b> went, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> if <b>I</b> stayed any longer my soul would be destroyed. The truth is {{that you had to}} be in the racial majority to get the parts." [...] Lim also confessed that he's [...] "not one for schmoozing. My career would have been severely hampered if I had hung out there." ...|$|R

He was a dastardly knave, and would have played false to the sun, the moon, and the stars had they shown him an opportunity, bedad. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> his daughter; she sailed on my ship for many days, and her {{presence}} blessed the very boards she trod on. She is a most noble lady; and if you will not admit, sir, that her sweet spirit and pure soul have not banished from this earth every taint of wickedness left here by her father, then, sir, bedad, stand where you are and draw!" ...|$|R

It appears to me highly {{important}} that Mr. Micawber should, from the hour of his embarkation, feel his position. Your old knowledge of me, my dear Mr. Copperfield, will have told you that I have not the sanguine disposition of Mr. Micawber. My disposition is, if I may say so, eminently practical. I {{know that this is}} a long voyage. I know that it will involve many privations and inconveniences. I cannot shut my eyes to those facts. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> what Mr. Micawber is. I know the latent power of Mr. Micawber.

He loves me dearly; will wait for me a dozen years, if I say so, and work all his days to make me happy. He's a help and comfort to mother, a good friend to Toady, and I love and respect and am proud of him, though you do say he is a fool," [...] cried Polly heartily.|$|E
5000|$|Villarroel had a poor {{opinion of}} his own {{knowledge}} of mathematics and science, {{a result of the}} low quality of education available in the Spain of his era. As he wrote: [...] "I knew well my ignorance and blindness as I went groping down the alleyways of my profession. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>I</b> was {{in the land of the}} blind, for Spain lay in the grip of a darkness so fearsome that in no school, college or university in any one of its cities was there an individual capable of lighting a lamp whereby one might seek out the elements of these sciences. In the country of the blind the one-eyed man is king" [...] (quoted by Atkinson, page 24).|$|R
5000|$|In the 1990s Astro {{starred in}} Guardians of the Galaxy, which ran for 62 issues. It was {{initially}} {{written and illustrated}} by Jim Valentino. Valentino still found Vance's containment suit a problem: [...] The containment suit made absolutely no sense any way you turned it. So I knew I wanted {{to get him out of}} it from the start, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> it had to be a process. His relationship with Aleta, which was started very early on, was part of the process Vance had to go through. The suit, the romance, losing her, getting out of the suit, becoming the ersatz Captain America - all of it was Vance's arc on his way to becoming a hero and a leader. He had to become Major Victory before he could become Major Astro, but that's where he was heading.|$|R

"I know that, Raoul; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> {{there are}} numbers of our nobles and gentlemen who, {{although}} staunch Catholics, are sickened at seeing the king {{acting as the}} tool of Philip of Spain and the pope; and who shudder, as I do, at beholding France stained with blood from end to end, simply because people choose to worship God in their own way. You must remember {{that these people are}} not the ignorant scum of our towns, but that among them are a large number of our best and wisest heads. I shall fight no less staunchly, when fighting has to be done, because I am convinced that it is all wrong. If they are in arms against the king, I must be in arms for him; but I hope none the less that, when arms are laid down, there will be a cessation of persecution--at any rate, a cessation of massacre. It is bringing disgrace on us in the eyes of all Europe, and I trust {{that there may be a}} league made among us to withstand the Guises; and to insist that there shall be, in France, no repetition of the atrocities by which Philip of Spain, and the Duke of Alva, are trying to stamp out the reformed religion in the Netherlands." ...|$|E
60|$|These {{arrangements}} {{had occupied}} the general attention advantageously for all, though (as I {{expressed in the}} last sentence) they ended in a sorrowful feeling. I now said {{a few words to}} my fellow-voyagers {{on the subject of the}} small stock of food on which our lives depended if they were preserved from the great deep, and on the rigid necessity of our eking it out in the most frugal manner. One and all replied that whatever allowance I thought best to lay down should be strictly kept to. We made a pair of scales out of a thin scrap of iron-plating and some twine, and I got together for weights such of the heaviest buttons among us as I calculated made up some fraction over two ounces. This was the allowance of solid food served out once a-day to each, from that time to the end; with the addition of a coffee-berry, or sometimes half a one, when the weather was very fair, for breakfast. We had nothing else whatever, but half a pint of water each per day, and sometimes, when we were coldest and weakest, a teaspoonful of rum each, served out as a dram. I know how learnedly it can be shown that rum is poison, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> that in this case, as in all similar cases I have ever read of--which are numerous--no words can express the comfort and support derived from it. Nor have I the least doubt that it saved the lives of far more than half our number. Having mentioned half a pint of water as our daily allowance, I ought to observe that sometimes we had less, and sometimes we had more; for much rain fell, and we caught it in a canvas stretched for the purpose.|$|E

5000|$|... "Spanish Harlem" [...] {{is a song}} {{released}} by Ben E. King in 1960 on Atco Records, written by Jerry Leiber and Phil Spector, and produced by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. During a 1968 interview, Leiber credited Stoller with the arrangement; similarly, in a 2009 radio interview with Leiber and Stoller on the Bob Edwards Weekend talk show, Jerry Leiber said that Stoller, while uncredited, had written the key instrumental introduction to the record. In the team's autobiography from the same year, Hound Dog, Stoller himself remarks that he had created this [...] "fill" [...] while doing a piano accompaniment when the song was presented to Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler at Atlantic Records, with Spector playing guitar and Leiber doing the vocal. [...] "Since then, I've never heard the song played without that musical figure. I presumed my contribution was seminal to the composition, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> that Phil didn't want to share credit with anyone <b>but</b> Jerry, so <b>I</b> kept quiet." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{second major}} theme of Hayden's gubernatorial career was to reappraise {{properties}} {{in order to}} adjust property taxes. Hayden proposed a {{question as to whether}} or not the people of his constituency wanted to move from the uniform system to a new system of classification. The people voted yes. He put a system in place that worked annually with one third of the property population so that there would be a turnover in property taxes every three years. The reappraisal raised taxes on some of the citizens, and lowered the taxes on others. It helped the farmers and homeowners, but commercial property owners and real estate agents were enraged at how the property tax appraisal turned out. The issue heavily split the Republican party. Hayden stated [...] "I knew it was the right thing to do, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> that politically it was probably the kiss of death, and ultimately proved to be so far as the election goes." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{shuttering}} {{of large}} chain bookstores, {{most notably the}} nearby Books-A-Million, {{proved to be a}} benefit to Kramer's although the increased number of trendy restaurants in the city affected the cafe's business. [...] The cafe and bookstore bring in around the same amount of revenue, whereas before the cafe brought in more money. In 2015, the combines sales for the restaurant and cafe was $10 million. That same year Kramer and Tenney began plans to sell the business. Tenney said [...] "I knew the business was viable, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> the restaurant was beat up and tired. If we could find some way to resurrect and invigorate the restaurant, there would be a wonderful future ahead." [...] They were introduced to &pizza co-founder Steve Salis and in 2016 it was announced Salis would purchase Kramer's with Tenney remaining as part-owner. [...] Salis oversaw an expansion and renovation of the business that included purchasing the adjoining building previously occupied by Willie T’s Lobster Shack. With the additional 800 sq ft of retail space, the bookstore and cafe measure 4500 sq ft. [...] In 2017, several longtime employees, including the general manager, events manager, and head buyer, quit after disagreements with Salis and opened a new bookstore on H Street NE later that year..|$|R
5000|$|On {{the first}} play after halftime, he threw his third {{interception}} {{of the day and}} second to Moore, who has five for the season. Kai Forbath kicked a 39-yard field goal four plays later for a 13-10 lead. [...] "I just read the quarterback," [...] Moore said. [...] "I knew that Crompton had some skills, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> that he could throw a pick because any quarterback can. I was just sitting back and reading the quarterback." [...] Kiffin, who has pledged not to shuffle quarterbacks during games, stuck with Crompton. Tennessee went three-and-out on its next two drives, and Forbath answered with field goals of 31 and 47 yards to give UCLA a 19-10 lead with 2:39 in the third quarter. Forbath, who beat Tennessee with an overtime field goal in California last season, made four field goals in the rematch. Prince finished 11-for-23 for 101 yards and the one touchdown. Johnathan Franklin had 80 yards rushing. In the second quarter, Crompton fumbled a snap at the Tennessee 36, and Jerzy Siewierski recovered. A few plays later, Prince threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Chane Moline as he was being hit, tying the score at 10 with 7:09 before halftime.|$|R

It was not until I saw you sitting there beside Duncan that the idea occurred to me. It didn't make a great deal of difference whether Duncan or Lovejoy got to the House or not, provided they didn't learn of the matter too early, because some of their men had been bought off that day. It suited Jethro's sense of humor to play the game that way--and it was very effective.
