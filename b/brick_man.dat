60|$|Consequently, as Mr. Burke had a {{great deal}} to do with the building, and as Mrs. Cliff did not appear to be {{concerned}} in it at all, it was generally believed that the gentleman at the hotel was putting up a house for himself on the corner lot.

[...] Dahlgren replied, [...] "There is nothing but a corporal's guard [...] in the fort, and {{all we have to do}} is go and take possession." [...] This underestimation of the Confederate forces on Dahlgren's part may explain why he was hostile to a joint operation wishing to reserve the credit for the victory to the navy. Less than half of the boats landed. [...] Most of the boats that did land landed on the right flank or right gorge angle, rather than on the gorge where there was a passable breach.

The girls changed buses, the youth allegedly followed them and continued harassing despite a female co-passenger's objections.

40|$|In the Interregnum England, {{many women}} preachers {{appeared}} among the radical sectarian movement. They were preached on the tub or <b>bricks,</b> like <b>men</b> sectarians. This paper shows the Cosmology {{and the idea}} of sex difference in the pamphlets attacks on the women preachers. As T. Laqueur says, 2 ̆ 7 One Sex Model 2 ̆ 7 was dominant in the early modern Europe. 2 ̆ 7 One Sex Model 2 ̆ 7, the fluid and interchangeable body image, was connected with Cosmology-Micro-Cosmos (human body) corresponded to Macro-Cosmos (the World), according to Cosmos God created [...] . This model is completely different from our modern 2 ̆ 7 Two Sex Model 2 ̆ 7, based on the idea of body in modern anatomy, biology and medical science. In Thomason Tracts, there were many women 2 ̆ 7 s petitions or remonstrances. And we can see the word 2 ̆ 7 Women 2 ̆ 7 s or Ladie 2 ̆ 7 s Parliament 2 ̆ 7. It clears that many women expressed their will and opinion in 2 ̆ 7 the world turned upside down 2 ̆ 7 (C. Hill). A DISCOVERIE of Six women preachers (anon.) showed author 2 ̆ 7 s experience and observation about women 2 ̆ 7 s spiritual leadership with the help of supernatural powers. People would have both the fear and the respect of the women preachers. In A Spirit Moving in the Women-Preachers (anon.), the author exhaustively criticized the women preachers in sects by citation of the Bible. These attacks on women preachers based on the early modern Cosmology and Spirituality. The moving of spirit was the most important in both tracts. But their strong tensional discourse suggests the fear about subversion or disturbance of the static order relating to sex, included in the Cosmology. Women were considered 2 ̆ 7 the weaker sex (vessel) 2 ̆ 7 and this idea held the Cosmological order of men and women. Everyone was to be in the 2 ̆ 7 proper place 2 ̆ 7 in order for the God 2 ̆ 7 s Cosmos. But the dream of Millenarianism and 2 ̆ 7 the world turned upside down 2 ̆ 7 in the Interregnum, supported by ordinaries, gave many women the power of preaching or teaching to people. Their conduct would be impossible in the order (the Cosmos) in the period. Women preachers disappeared in 1660 s, as sectarian movement had died down...|$|R
5000|$|To {{strike at}} a man's {{food and shelter}} is to strike at his life; and in a society {{organized}} on a tooth-and-nail basis, such an act, performed {{though it may be}} under the guise of generosity, is none the less menacing and terrible. It {{is for this reason that}} a laborer is so fiercely hostile to another laborer who offers to work for less pay or longer hours. To hold his place, (which is to live), he must offset this offer by another equally liberal, which is equivalent to giving away somewhat from the food and shelter he enjoys....When a striker kills with a <b>brick</b> the <b>man</b> who has taken his place, he has no sense of wrong-doing. In the deepest holds of his being, though he does not reason the impulse, he has an ethical sanction. He feels dimly that he has justification, just as the home-defending Boer felt, though more sharply, with each bullet he fired at the invading English.

The generousness on his part is hurtful to his fellow-laborers, for it compels them to an equal generousness which is not to their liking, and which gives them less of food and shelter. But a word may be said for the scab. Just as his act makes his rivals compulsorily generous, so do they, by fortune of birth and training, make compulsory his act of generousness....Nobody desires to scab, to give most for least. The ambition of every individual is quite the opposite, to give least for most; and, as a result, living in a tooth-and-nail society, battle royal is waged by the ambitious individuals. But in its most salient aspect, that of the struggle over the division of the joint product, it is no longer a battle between individuals, but between groups of individuals. Capital and labor apply themselves to raw material, make something useful out of it, add to its value, and then proceed to quarrel over the division of the added value. Neither cares to give most for least. Each is intent on giving less than the other and on receiving more.|$|R

That stifled hum of Midnight, when Traffic has lain down to rest; and the chariot-wheels of Vanity, still rolling here and there through distant streets, are bearing her to Halls roofed in, and lighted to the due pitch for her; and only Vice and Misery, to prowl or to moan like nightbirds, are abroad: that hum, I say, like the stertorous, unquiet slumber of sick Life, is heard in Heaven!

The Lover whispers his mistress that the coach is ready; and she, full of hope and fear, glides down, to fly with him over the borders: the Thief, still more silently, sets to his picklocks and crowbars, or lurks in wait till the watchmen first snore in their boxes. Gay mansions, with supper-rooms and dancing-rooms, are full of light and music and high-swelling hearts; but, in the Condemned Cells, the pulse of life beats tremulous and faint, and bloodshot eyes look out through the darkness, which is around and within, for the light of a stern last morning. Six men are to be hanged on the morrow: comes no hammering from the Rabenstein?--their gallows must even now be o' building. Upwards of five hundred thousand two-legged animals without feathers lie round us, in horizontal position; their heads all in nightcaps, and full of the foolishest dreams. Riot cries aloud, and staggers and swaggers in his rank dens of shame; and the Mother, with streaming hair, kneels over her pallid dying infant, whose cracked lips only her tears now moisten.--All these heaped and huddled together, with nothing but a little carpentry and masonry between them;--crammed in, like salted fish in their barrel;--or weltering, shall I say, like an Egyptian pitcher of tamed vipers, each struggling to get its head above the others: such work goes on under that smoke-counterpane!--But I, mein Werther, sit above it all; I am alone with the stars." ...|$|R
