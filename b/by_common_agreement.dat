500|$|Hellenic Nomarchy proclaims {{that society}} must {{be governed by}} laws {{established}} <b>by</b> <b>common</b> <b>agreement</b> {{of the people and}} that the establishment and preservation of liberty requires a Nomarchic form of government. Although this term was uncommon in the Greek literature of that time, it is used as an alternative term of democracy. The intent of Hellenic Nomarchy was to show that the sole power and authority of the [...] "law" [...] (...) could only be established through democracy. In this spirit, the author was following the principles stressed by ancient Greek literature and philosophy concerning the subject. The work also argues that Greeks should not have any leader other than their own laws. This principle follows from the works of Rigas Feraios, who stressed in his Revolutionary Manifesto, some years before, that law is the supreme master of men. Feraios also praised democracy as the most successful system of government.|$|E
60|$|In a {{state of}} RUDE nature {{there is no such}} thing as a people. A number of men in {{themselves}} have no collective capacity. The idea of a people is the idea of a corporation. It is wholly artificial; and made like all other legal fictions <b>by</b> <b>common</b> <b>agreement.</b> What the particular nature of that agreement was, is collected from the form into which the particular society has been cast. Any other is not THEIR covenant. When men, therefore, break up the original compact or agreement, which gives its corporate form and capacity to a state, they are no longer a people; they have no longer a corporate existence; they have no longer a legal, coactive force to bind within, nor a claim to be recognised abroad. They are a number of vague, loose individuals, and nothing more. With them all is to begin again. Alas! they little know how many a weary step is to be taken before they can form themselves into a mass, which has a true, politic personality.|$|E

The United States and Canada also have resolved several major issues involving fisheries. <b>By</b> <b>common</b> <b>agreement,</b> the two countries submitted a Gulf of Maine boundary dispute to the International Court of Justice in 1981; both accepted the court's 12 October 1984 ruling which demarcated the territorial sea boundary.

5000|$|Semiotics {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between the form of the sign (the signifier) and the meaning expressed (the signified), and thereby attempts to reveal the process of communicating understanding. In each case, a message is to be sent by an addresser to an addressee. For this to occur, the addresser and addressee must use a common code, Hence, language evolves dynamically. The community will identify a lexical thing that needs to be referred to in their language. <b>By</b> <b>common</b> <b>agreement,</b> a sign (sometimes called a signal) will be selected. Of the many possible shades of meanings that {{it can be used to}} convey, one or more will be selected and encoded, i.e. the chosen meaning(s) will be denoted or associated with the sign within the broader framework of syntactic and semantic systems available within the community. When the audience is exposed to the sign, the expectation is that they will be able to decode the meaning. As Roman Jakobson adds, there will also be an emotional element or value which represents the addresser's attitude towards the thing. This will either become a connotative meaning attached directly to the sign itself, or it will be communicated by the context in which the sign is used by the addresser.|$|E

After a decade of social unrest and civil wars of mainly ethnic character, {{it has yet to}} come up in terms of economic development that is behind some advanced transition economies, namely those in Visegrad countries. With the admission of Bulgaria and Romania in the European Union (EU) since 2007, the Western Balkans finds itself completely surrounded by the EU. Despite that political environment is still fragile, the progress in economic cooperation is gaining a momentum through bilateral free trade agreements which recently are superseded <b>by</b> a single <b>common</b> <b>agreement</b> – Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), though the risk that the former to undermine the latter should not be underestimated. Whether current reforms are a process of push factors from inside – the necessity of small economies for greater cooperation, or encouraged as a prerequisite by the EU – regional economic integration facilitates the road to the EU accession and membership, they first of all are designed and initiated for sustainable development and better economic welfare. The aim of this paper is two fold: first, to investigate the prospect of trade regimes, investment promotion programs and export incentives; and second, to find out to what extent these reforms are contributing to economic integration and political stabilization of the Western Balkans. ...|$|R
