5|$|The video {{begins with}} scenes of Brown wearing a {{mirrored}} mask inside a giant birdcage, before {{switching to a}} dance routine in a smoke-filled, graffiti-covered parking garage. In between these scenes, the video shows a Step Up-type dance-off in the parking garage. When Brown raps his verse, he is seen standing next to Rhymes, wearing horn-rimmed glasses, a red Brooklyn cap, and a white baseball jersey, which was the signature look of Mars Blackmon from the 1986 film, She's Gotta Have It. Rhymes then raps his verse after Brown's, standing <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> later on the stairs in the parking garage. Wayne's verse soon follows after, with scenes of him rapping {{in front of the}} DeLorean DMC-12 sports car, and also on top of an ambulance car. The video also features cameo appearance from Kevin McCall, Diplo, Birdman and Mack Maine. Birdman and Maine appear when Lil Wayne is performing his verse.|$|E
25|$|During the {{beginning}} of Edward's reign, Cecily appeared <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> maintained her influence. In 1461, she revised her coat of arms to include the royal arms of England, hinting {{that her husband had}} been a rightful king. When Edward married Elizabeth Woodville, he built new queen's quarters for her and let his mother remain in the queen's quarters in which she had been living.|$|E

For convenience he often rode a moped when in London.|$|E

25|$|A clown is seen {{walking with}} Graziosa, the gypsy chief's daughter. A gypsy tells {{the chief of}} the {{approach}} of Don Quixote. The chief plans a trick for his benefit and, putting on a mantle crown, sits down as though he were a king on a throne. Don Quixote is deceived and kneels to the chief in homage. The chief bids that he sit <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> orders a festival to be given in his honor. This begins with Gypsy dances and is followed by a performance of the marionette theatre. Don Quixote is delighted with the entertainment but, mistaking the heroine for his Dulcinea and the marionettes for soldiers attacking her, he rises to assault them. The gypsies are terrified. At this moment the clown and Graziosa run away.|$|E
500|$|The jocular mood of {{the gunmen}} {{abruptly}} ceased. At no time did this new soldier speak {{to any of the}} band members nor did he directly address Crozier. He relayed all his instructions to the gunman in command. Travers, the band's new bass player, assumed he was a British Army officer, an opinion shared by McCoy. Just after the arrival of this mysterious soldier, McCoy nudged Travers, who was standing <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> reassured him by saying [...] "Don't worry Stephen, this is British Army". Travers thought that McCoy, a Protestant from Northern Ireland, was familiar with security checkpoints and had reckoned the regular British Army would be more efficient than the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR), who had a reputation for unprofessional and unpredictable behaviour, especially towards people from the Republic.|$|E
500|$|Jonah is of {{symbolic}} and prophetic significance, which was commonly perceived {{and had been}} represented in countless works of art including manuscripts and stained glass windows. Through his reluctance to obey God, he was swallowed by a [...] "mighty fish". He spent three days in its belly and was eventually spewed up on dry land where he went about God's business. Jonah was thus seen as presaging Jesus, who having died by crucifixion, spent part of three days in a tomb and was raised on the third day. So, on {{the ceiling of the}} Sistine Chapel, Jonah, with the [...] "great fish" [...] <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> his eyes turned towards God the Creator, represents a [...] "portent" [...] of the Passion and Resurrection of Christ. The Jonah figure placed right over the altar activated the Passion motif. [...] "When Perugino's altar painting was removed and... Last Judgement fresco came to cover the altar wall", after at least twenty five years Michelangelo depicted Christ just below Jonah: not only for his role as precursor of Christ, Christianity and Christocentrism, but also because his powerful torsion of the body, bent backwards from the bust to the eyes and with his forefingers that now point the glorious Jesus to the characters of the ceiling, assumes a function of link between the Old and New Testament.|$|E

2500|$|Edward Kienholz died {{suddenly}} in Idaho on June 10, 1994, {{from a heart}} attack after hiking in the mountains near their home. He was a chronic smoker who had been struggling with diabetes, which progressively impaired use of his extremities. He was buried in an authentic Kienholz installation; Robert Hughes wrote, [...] "is corpulent, embalmed body was wedged into the front seat of a brown 1940 Packard coupe. There was a dollar and a deck of cards in his pocket, a bottle of 1931 Chianti <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> the ashes of his dog Smash in the back. He was set for the afterlife. To the whine of bagpipes, the Packard, steered by his widow Nancy Reddin Kienholz, rolled like a funeral barge into the big hole." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{news was}} {{followed}} by more reported sightings, until in August 1877 {{one of the most}} notable reports about Spring-heeled Jack came from a group of soldiers in Aldershot's barracks. This story went as follows: a sentry on duty at the North Camp peered into the darkness, his attention attracted by a peculiar figure [...] "advancing towards him." [...] The soldier issued a challenge, which went unheeded, and the figure came up <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> delivered several slaps to his face. A guard shot at him, with no visible effect; some sources claim that the soldier may have fired blanks at him, others that he missed or fired warning shots. The strange figure then disappeared into the surrounding darkness [...] "with astonishing bounds." ...|$|E
2500|$|Annett {{followed}} him to the station, sat down <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> offered some cigarettes. Von Janowski lit the cigarette using the same Belgian matches he had at the hotel. Annett grew even more suspicious and alerted a Quebec Provincial Police constable, who quickly boarded the train as it pulled away from the station and began searching for the stranger. The policeman located von Janowski, who said he was a radio salesman from Toronto. He stuck with this story until the policeman asked to search his bags; the stranger then confessed: [...] "That will not be necessary. I am a German officer who serves his country as you do yourself." [...] Inspection of von Janowski's personal effects upon his arrest revealed that he was carrying a powerful radio transmitter, among other things.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the day of}} John's acclamation, 1 January 1707, his new throne {{was placed}} on the balcony of the Torre do Rei (Tower of the King) of Ribeira Palace. Specially-made {{tapestries}} illustrating the allegories of Justice and Prudence were hung high above the Terreiro do Paço to remind the public that these were the traits their king would have. Once John sat down on his throne, wreaths made of gold were laid around the throne and balcony. [...] Wearing his Cross of the Order of Christ, and with the Portuguese Crown Jewels <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> not on him, as was the Portuguese royal custom, John was acclamed [...] "His Majesty, by the Grace of God, King of Portugal and the Algarves, before and beyond the sea in Africa, Lord of Guinea and of Conquest, Navigation, and Commerce of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia, and India, our Lord, John, the fifth of that name in the table of the Kings of Portugal." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), when Jacob left Beersheba for Haran, {{he stopped at}} {{a place for the}} night, using a stone for a pillow. He dreamed that he saw a ladder to heaven on which God's angels ascended and descended. And God stood <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> promised to give him and his {{numerous}} descendants the land on which he lay, said that through his descendants all the earth would be blessed, and promised to stay with him wherever he went and bring him back to the land. Jacob awoke afraid, remarked that surely the place was the house of God, the gate of heaven, and called the place Bethel (although the Canaanites had called the city Luz). Jacob took the stone from under his head, set it up as a pillar, and poured oil on it. And Jacob vowed that if God would stay with him, give him bread and clothing, and return him to his father's house in peace, then God would be his god, the stone pillar would be God's house, and he would give God a tenth of what he received. The first reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here with the end of chapter ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the podium}} {{ceremony}} following the race, Rosberg was booed by the crowd, mirroring a similar incident towards {{him at the}} previous race in Belgium. Hamilton later told the press {{that he did not}} feel comfortable about the fans behaving in such a manner: [...] "I've had it here, years and years ago, and it's great personally for me to have such great support, from the Ferrari fans and the Mercedes fans. But when I was up there, it was awkward for me to hear them booing Nico because I just don't like that in sport." [...] Wolff affirmed that booing should not be heard on the podium but acknowledged Formula One is an emotional sport for its fan base while also saying: [...] "It's a sport and sport should unite." [...] When asked about the booing in the press conference, Rosberg replied while it was [...] "not nice" [...] he hoped over time the fans would forgive him for his past actions. In the podium interviews, conducted by former driver Jean Alesi, Massa expressed his happiness on standing on the podium and was certain luck was <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> that there was [...] "a lot more to come." ...|$|E
2500|$|As he praises Mackintosh's {{impressive}} {{talents and}} intellect, however, Hazlitt also brings out his limitations. In demolishing his adversaries, including Godwin and the reformers {{in his famous}} lectures, Mackintosh [...] "seemed to stand {{with his back to}} the drawers in a metaphysical dispensary, and to take out of them whatever ingredients suited his purpose. In this way he had an antidote for every error, an answer to every folly. The writings of Burke, Hume, Berkeley, Paley, Lord Bacon, Jeremy Taylor, Grotius, Puffendorf, Cicero, Aristotle, Tacitus, Livy, Sully, Machiavel, Guicciardini, Thuanus, lay open <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> he could instantly lay his hand upon the passage, and quote them chapter and verse to the clearing up of all difficulties, and the silencing of all oppugners." [...] But there is a fatal flaw in all this impressive intellectual [...] "juggling" [...] (which, Tom Paulin notes, alludes to Hazlitt's earlier contrast between the deft but mechanical [...] "Indian jugglers" [...] and representatives of true genius): his performances were [...] "philosophical centos", the thoughts of others simply stitched together. [...] "They were profound, brilliant, new to his hearers; but the profundity, the brilliancy, the novelty were not his own." [...] For all his impressive erudition, Mackintosh's writing and speaking are entirely unoriginal.|$|E

2500|$|De Valera's {{supporters}} and detractors argue about his bravery during the Easter Rising. His supporters claim he showed leadership skills and {{a capacity for}} meticulous planning. His detractors claim he suffered a nervous breakdown during the Rising. According to accounts from 1916, de Valera was seen running about, giving conflicting orders, refusing to sleep and on one occasion, having forgotten the password, almost getting himself shot in the dark by his own men. According to one account, de Valera, on being forced to sleep by one subordinate who promised to sit <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> wake {{him if he was}} needed, suddenly woke up, his eyes [...] "wild", screaming, [...] "Set fire to the railway! Set fire to the railway!" [...] Later in the Ballykinlar internment Camp, one de Valera loyalist approached another internee, a medical doctor, recounted the story, and asked for a medical opinion as to de Valera's condition. He also threatened to sue the doctor, future Fine Gael Teachta Dála (TD) and minister, Dr. Tom O'Higgins, if he ever repeated the story. The British reportedly, however, considered de Valera's forces the best-trained and best-led among the rebels. De Valera's latest biographer, Anthony J. Jordan, writes of this controversy, [...] "Whatever happened in Boland's Mills, or any other garrison, does not negate or undermine in any way the extraordinary heroism of [...] "Dev" [...] and his comrades".|$|E
2500|$|Lewis {{is widely}} hailed {{as one of}} the most {{influential}} pianists in the history of rock and roll. [...] In an often quoted tribute, Elvis Presley once said that if he could play the piano like Lewis he would quit singing. [...] Lewis's pivotal role in popularizing the piano in rock and roll is indisputable. [...] Up until his arrival, the music had been primarily associated with guitars, but his early Sun recordings and television appearances pushed the instrument to the forefront. [...] Lewis was also an incendiary showman who often played with his fists, elbows, feet, and backside, sometimes climbing on top of the piano during gigs and even apocryphally setting it on fire. [...] Like Chuck Berry's guitar playing, Lewis's piano style has become synonymous with rock and roll, having influenced generations of piano players. [...] In a 2013 interview with Leah Harper, Elton John recalls that up until [...] "Great Balls of Fire," [...] "the piano playing that I had heard had been more sedate. [...] My dad collected George Shearing records, but this was the first time I heard someone beat the shit out of a piano. When I saw Little Richard at the Harrow Granada, he played it standing up, but Jerry Lee Lewis actually jumped on the piano! This was astonishing to me, that people could do that. Those records had such a huge effect on me, and they were just so great. I learned to play like that." [...] Lewis is primarily known for his [...] "boogie woogie" [...] style, which is characterized by a regular left hand bass figure and dancing beat, but his command of the instrument and highly individualistic style set him apart. [...] Appearing on Memphis Sounds with George Klein in 2011, Lewis credited his older piano-playing cousin Carl McVoy as being a crucial influence, stating, [...] "He was a great piano player, a great singer, and a nice looking man, carried himself real well. [...] I miss Carl very much." [...] Lewis also cited Moon Mullican as a source of inspiration. [...] Although almost entirely self-taught, Lewis conceded to biographer Rich Bragg in 2014 that Paul Whitehead, a blind pianist from Meadville, Mississippi, was another key influence on him in his earliest days playing clubs, confiding, [...] "Paul Whitehead done a lot. [...] His lesson was worth a billion dollars to me...He taught me. [...] I'd sit <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> say, 'Mr. Paul, can you show me exactly how you do that?' [...] Mr. Paul was good to me." ...|$|E
