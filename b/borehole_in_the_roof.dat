To improve stress relief gas extraction, cross-measure boreholes were drilled into the stress relief areas defined in Sect.  2 of this paper. The corresponding elevation angle of cross-measure <b>boreholes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> roadway is 26 °– 42 °. The elevation angle of actual operation is 32 ° and the azimuth angle is perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> roadway.

40|$|The physico-chemical {{characteristics}} of the groundwater at Akatsi and Ketu districts were investigated. Water samples were collected from 34 <b>boreholes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Akatsi District and 27 <b>boreholes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ketu District and analysed for their quality parameters, using appropriate certified and acceptable international standard methods. Most of the water quality variables measured were within the WHO and GWCL guidelines for drinking water. The results showed that groundwater <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two districts are soft but slightly acidic with ranges 5. 75 – 7. 39 pH units and 5. 14 – 7. 15 pH units for Akatsi and Ketu districts, respectively, and mean 6. 73 pH units for Akatsi and 6. 5 pH units for Ketu. Groundwater in both districts were also mineralized with conductivity ranges 170 – 6440 µS/cm and 420 - 5180 µS/cm for Akatsi and Ketu districts, respectively, and mean 1450. 9 µS/cm for Akatsi and 1737. 1 µS/cm for Ketu. SO 42 - and Cl- ion concentrations <b>in</b> some <b>boreholes</b> <b>in</b> both districts were at such elevated levels that serious health effects and risks might arise after prolonged and continuous intake. The NO 3 -N concentrations <b>in</b> some of <b>the</b> <b>boreholes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two districts were present at elevated levels (far above the critical value of 10 mg/l) and might cause cyanosis, a potential health risk in infants...|$|R

30|$|This {{implies that}} <b>boreholes</b> located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{southern}} {{to the eastern}} flank of Lekki axis are relatively not susceptible to contamination {{because of the presence}} of clay units serving as protective layer over the protected zone and hence the high quality of water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region indicated by high resistivity values which was also found to be so when Todd and Mays (2005) used a practical field method to estimate groundwater quality in Louisiana from resistivity logs. <b>Boreholes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western flank of the state are susceptible to contamination because of the relative absence of a thick protective layer in this zone. Therefore, <b>boreholes</b> <b>in</b> this region should be drilled to greater depth than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern and western flank of the axis.
