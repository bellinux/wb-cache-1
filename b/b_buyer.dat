40|$|When {{brand equity}} became {{a hot topic}} in the late 80 ’s, the success of one {{industry}} after another shows {{that it has a}} prominent role in the realm of marketing. According to David Aaker, brand equity can be categorised into brand awareness, brand associations, perceived quality, brand loyalty and other proprietary brand assets. The brand equity brings values to both customer and firms. Brand equity, however, cannot be measured in dollars and cents but rather a direct result of how consumers value a brand based on their experiences and perceptions. Therefore, Kevin Keller’s model examines brand equity based on customer perception. In the Malaysian pharmaceutical industry, prescription brands are mainly from innovator companies. However, the innovator brands are not as compelling as the FMCG’s due to the support for generic medications. There are two types of buyers, business-to-business and business-to-consumer buyers. The doctors and pharmacists are the business customers with a unique role where they have deep influence in consumer decision to purchase. Therefore, {{the first part of the}} study is to understand the perceptions of both business customers and consumers towards Aaker’s five brand assets. The fifth brand asset selected is country-of-origin because it is assumed that developed country is preferred to developing country when purchasing prescription drugs. In addition, in the second part of the study, the researcher is interested to find out the roles of corporate and condition brands in prescription branding based on customers’ feedback. The information gathered provides preliminary understandings of the effects of the pharmaceutical companies’ branding and marketing strategies in Malaysian markets. Findings from this study demonstrate that the innovator brands are strong in perceived quality and performance-related associations. Brand awareness, imagery-related associations, brand loyalty and country-of-origin are viewed as less important. The <b>B</b> 2 <b>B</b> <b>buyers</b> are the technical buyers who place performance as the most important factors in their purchase decision. The <b>B</b> 2 C <b>buyers</b> consider doctor’s recommendations as the most important factor. The B 2 C market is divided into brand onscious and brand indifferent segments. The brand equity is weak in the prescription market due to the constraints of healthcare regulations and the unpleasant connotation of disease and treatment. The results also show that corporate branding has a positive role in prescription drugs and condition branding is generally not favoured for common conditions. In conclusion, brand equity can be created and maintained if pharmaceutical companies are able to find ways to communicate their brand to their customers, particularly the <b>B</b> 2 <b>B</b> <b>buyers</b> and brand-conscious consumers. Although this can be difficult, given the regulation and business constraints, it is still possible to build a strong brand. This is largely dependent on the ability of pharmaceutical companies to successfully implement their marketing mix to uncover brand promise that delivers product satisfaction and improved ‘quality of life’...|$|R

We study the relationships in the emerging Slovenian economy, in which firms highly depend on imports and exports from international B 2 B markets, where business relationships and their components are important performance drivers. The findings are based on a case study of a Slovenian retailer that purchases home improvement and construction products from a German supplier and sells them in the Croatian market to its <b>B</b> 2 <b>B</b> <b>buyers.</b> The study was carried out in 2007.

Using purpose-based sampling, 42 regular buyers answered the questionnaire. The study yielded some interesting results. The main indication was that export performance as a dependent variable was affected by two major factors: readiness to export and formation of the internationalization process, and the systematic creation and incorporation of relationships with potential buyers from the early (or preparatory) stages of the firm’s entrance into the market, irrespective of the level of the distribution channel. It also showed that relationship marketing can be differently approached and understood in different cultures, and that marketers should be very cautious when designing “universal solutions ” for relationships, as Palmer (1997) explained a decade ago...|$|R

The effectiveness of their social media campaigns may be realized when their customers transmit company brand messages across their unique networks of friends and associates (Berger and Milkman 2012). Indeed, marketers using social media try to determine what messages will engage their customers. In essay one, we provide guidance to B 2 B (business-to-business) managers by examining the usage and effectiveness of social media message strategies. Building on B 2 B advertising, organizational buying, and word-of-mouth theories, we highlight key differences in B 2 B and business-to-consumer (B 2 C) social media message strategies in terms of branding, message appeals, selling, and information search. Analyzing 1, 467 Facebook wall posts by Fortune- 500 companies, using Bayesian Models, we find differences in the usage and effectiveness (message likes and comments) of social media. Specifically, {{the results indicate that}} the use of 1) corporate brands, 2) functional and emotional appeals, and 3) information search results in a higher percentage of message likes in B 2 B messages than in B 2 C messages. In addition, we find that <b>B</b> 2 <b>B</b> <b>buyers,</b> when compared to B 2 C consumers, demonstrate a higher message liking rate, but a lower message commenting rate. In essay two, we examine how and when social media communications get transmitted by estimating a Multivariate Multilevel Poisson Model.

To answer when, we examine the effect of offering characteristics, products (goods) versus services on the social transmission of content. Drawing upon the same Fortune- 500 dataset, we investigate the effectiveness of social media message strategies in terms of branding, message appeals, and vividness. We find that the use of corporate brand names is more effective (in terms of likes and comments) for service messages, whereas the use of images, videos, and product brand names is more effective for product messages. Furthermore, the results indicate that the use of corporate brand names, images, and videos yields a lower commenting rate, whereas the use of emotional appeals results in a higher liking and commenting rate...|$|R
40|$|Branding {{is seen as}} {{critical}} and decisive within the marketing literature (De Chernatony, 2010; Keller, 2012; Sundar & Noseworthy 2014) Though {{with the exception of}} Zou et al. (2003) work relating to the effects of marketing capabilities on export performance and Spyropoulou et al’. (2009) work providing an examination of branding advantage within export ventures; international brand management, antecedents of branding advantage and the cultivation of brand equity in foreign markets as a prerequisite for sustained export performance has been overlooked. Particularly when considering branding in the context ofbusiness-to-business (B 2 B), there is a complete absence of international B 2 B branding research (Mudambi, 2002; Van Riel et. al. 2005; Chen et. al. 2011). Despite the fact thatglobally over 95 % of all businesses are considered to be SMEs (OECD, 2014), there is a striking discrepancy in previous research relating to brand management and brand equity, which focuses, only on LOs (large organisations) and multinationals (Krake, 2005). There are a number of gaps that can be identified in the extant literature. Firstly, low exporting performance for B 2 B SMEs may relate to a limited scope of academic investigation, which has failed to address the impact of international brand management skills and the cultivation of brand equity in foreign markets. Secondly given buyers reliance on thebrand as a cue for uncertainty avoidance associated with the purchase decision (Swait & Erdum, 2007) the extant literature has yet to provide evidence regarding the extent to which international <b>B</b> 2 <b>B</b> <b>buyers</b> with differing cultural backgrounds rely on and use brands as signals of quality and trustworthiness to reduce the uncertainty associated with the transaction. A third gap is the deficiency within previous literature to identify and distinguish criteria for international branding capabilities that differ from their antecedent generic capabilities. Finally a fourth very important gap in extant literature is the failure toincorporate the views and perceptions of actual and potential international customers within the research agenda. We seek to further interest within this area by conceptualizing the key constructs.

Its main research problem asks: what perceptions do Finnish T&C industry buyers hold of India and Indian suppliers? <b>B</b> 2 <b>B</b> <b>buyers</b> use various supplier selection models and criteria in making their purchase decisions. A significant amount of research has been done into supplier selection practices, and in the context of international trade, country of origin (COO) perceptions specifically have garnered much attention. This thesis uses a mixed methods approach (online questionnaire and in-depth interviews) to evaluate Finnish T&C buyers’ supplier selection criteria, COO perceptions of India and experiences of Indian suppliers. It was found that the most important supplier selection criteria used by Finnish T&C buyers are quality, reliability and cost. COO perceptions were not found to be influential in purchasing process. Indian T&C suppliers’ strengths were found to be low cost, flexibility and a history of traditional T&C expertise. Their weaknesses include product quality and unreliable delivery times. Overall, the main challenges that need to be overcome by Indian T&C companies are logistical difficulties and the cost vs. quality trade-off. Despite positive perceptions of India for cost, the overall value offered by Indian T&C products was perceived to be low due to poor quality. Unreliable delivery time experiences also affected buyer’s reliability perceptions of Indian suppliers. The main limiting factors of this thesis relate to the small sample size used in the research.

The conceptual origins of this study lie in the field of 'country-of-origin' (COO) research. In recent history, competence in particular production processes and product categories have become increasingly dispersed among many countries worldwide generating greater sourcing options for business-to-business (<b>B</b> 2 <b>B)</b> <b>buyers.</b> It is evident that purchasing managers are required to simultaneously choose both a country and a company when making source country selection decision, a strong reality that has scarcely received attention in extant COO research. To validate the models in the three empirical papers, the study used a quantitative-positivist approach as the research paradigm; cross-sectional design as the survey method; and covariance-based structural equation modelling (SEM) as the major data analysis technique along with hierarchical regression analysis. The first paper‘s results showed that company effect is a valid second-order construct derived from four first-order marketing mix constructs, and that the role of company effect is substantially higher than country image on international supplier performance. The second paper found that international supplier performance is significantly influenced by company-specific effect and geographical proximity of the source country. The findings from the third paper showed that international supplier performance is significantly influenced by company effect and the geographical proximity of the source country. In addition, trade infrastructure, product-country image (PCI) and geographical proximity directly influence the company effect. Additionally, hierarchical regression analysis showed that product aspects and pricing aspects represent the significant company constructs, and that product-country image and geographical proximity are the significant country constructs as predictors of three supplier performance criteria. For purchasing managers, business consultants and country policy makers, the thesis provides evidence that competitiveness should be sourced from both company and country as company competitiveness alone cannot achieve a superior supplier image in the eyes of international buyers.

40|$|Purpose This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} customer perceptions about a salesperson’s combined use of adaptive selling (AS) and selling orientation (SO) on customer trust in the salesperson. Based on insights from attribution theory, the contingency model of salespeople effectiveness, relationship marketing and market orientation literatures, we analyze the interplay between customer perceptions of salespeople’s AS and SO, and how this affects customer trust. Furthermore, adopting a contingency perspective, we investigate how two important situational variables (i. e. length of buyer-seller relationships and importance of purchase for the buyer) affect this relationship. Design/methodology/approach Our study is based on regression analysis with two- and three-way interactions, using survey data from 134 <b>B</b> 2 <b>B</b> <b>buyers.</b> Findings Our {{results indicate that the}} interplay between AS and SO is negatively related to trust, and that the above situation is attenuated in sales contexts characterized by high purchase importance or enduring buyer-seller relationships. Research limitations/implications Our empirical findings are based on firms from a single industry. Second, we adopt a cross-sectional research design. Third, the absence of measures of objective performance (e. g. sales) might be regarded as a limitation. Practical implications Our study suggests that salespeople willing to win customer trust should modify their approach across the relationship life-cycle Similarly, when purchase importance for the customer is low, salespeople interested in building relationships based on trust should combine AS and customer orientation. In contrast, when purchase importance is high, salespeople can only generate more trust by increasing customer orientation/reducing selling orientation. These findings might inspire sales trainers and sales managers in developing training experiences based on adaptation and customer orientation Originality/value Our research contributes in several ways to the literature. First, we investigated the simultaneous effect of AS and SO on performance (i. e. customer trust). Second, we complemented the analysis of the interaction between AS and SO by testing two important boundary conditions residing in the selling situation: purchase importance and relationship length. Third, our study is the first to examine the interplay among AS, SO and selling context outside using customer data from actual B 2 B sales interactions.
