Brownback appeared with three children adopted from in vitro fertilization clinics to coincide with a Senate debate over the Cord <b>Blood</b> <b>Stem</b> <b>Cell</b> Act of 2005 to show {{his support for the}} bill and {{adult stem cell}} research. The Religious Freedom Coalition refers to children conceived through the adopted in vitro process as [...] "snowflake children." [...] The term, as proponents explain, is an extension of the idea that the embryos are [...] "frozen and unique," [...] and in that way are similar to snowflakes. Brownback supports the use of cord <b>blood</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> research for research and treatment. He opposes the use of embryonic stem cells in research or treatments for human health conditions.|$|E

2500|$|President Bush {{supported}} {{adult stem}} cell research and umbilical cord <b>blood</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> research. [...] However, Bush opposed any new {{embryonic stem cell research}}, and had limited the federal funding of existing research. Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research was first approved under President Clinton on January 19, 1999, but no money was to be spent until the guidelines were published. The guidelines were released under Clinton on August 23, 2000. They allowed use of unused frozen embryos. On August 9, 2001, before any funding was granted under these guidelines, Bush announced modifications to the guidelines to allow use of only existing stem cell lines. While Bush claimed that more than 60 embryonic stem cell lines already existed from privately funded research, scientists in 2003 said there were only 11 usable lines, and in 2005 that all lines approved for Federal funding are contaminated and unusable. Adult stem cell funding was not restricted and was supported by President Bush as a more viable means of research.|$|E
