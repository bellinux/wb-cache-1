40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} the clinical and radiologic features of orbital involvement in craniofacial <b>brown</b> <b>tumors</b> and {{to compare the}} rate of <b>brown</b> <b>tumors</b> in primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Methods: A retrospective hospital-based study of 115 patients with chronic kidney disease and secondary hyperparathyroidism and 34 with primary hyperparathyroidism was conducted. Laboratory results such as serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone were recorded. Demographic data (age, sex, duration of disease) and image findings (bone scan scintigraphy, skull and long bone x-rays, CT) were also obtained. The main outcome measures were analysis of clinical, biochemical, and radiologic findings of all patients. Results: Of the 115 patients with chronic kidney disease, 10 (8. 7 %) had <b>brown</b> <b>tumors</b> in different bones of the skeleton. Five patients had lesions in the craniofacial bones. The maxilla, mandible, maxillary sinus, and nasal cavity were the most affected sites. The orbit was involved in 2 patients with lesions arising in the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses. One patient had facial leontiasis. All patients with <b>brown</b> <b>tumors</b> had extremely high levels of parathyroid hormone (> 1, 000 pg/ml, normal values 10 - 69 pg/ml) and alkaline phosphatase (> 400 U/l, normal values 65 - 300 U/l). The mean serum levels of phosphorus and calcium were not abnormal among the patients with <b>brown</b> <b>tumors.</b> Age and time of renal failure were similar for patients with and without <b>brown</b> <b>tumors.</b> Among the patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, only 2 (5. 8 %) had <b>brown</b> <b>tumors,</b> and in just 1, the lesion was localized in the craniofacial skeleton. A 2 -tailed Z test applied to compare the proportion of occurrence of <b>brown</b> <b>tumors</b> in the 2 groups revealed that the difference at the 90 % of confidence level was not significant. Conclusions: <b>Brown</b> <b>tumors</b> are equally found in secondary and primary hyperparathyroidism. Craniofacial <b>brown</b> <b>tumors</b> involve the orbit, usually because of the osteodystrophy process that involves the maxilla and paranasal sinuses. The lesions do not necessarily need to be excised and may regress spontaneously after the control of hyperparathyroidism. CNP...|$|R

40|$|Background: Primary {{hyperparathyroidism}} is an endocrinopathic condition {{characterized by}} hypersecretion of parathyroid hormone. Excess parathyroid hormone {{results in an}} altered state of osseous metabolism involving bone resorption and tissue change known as osteitis fibrosa cystica, which is the end stage of primary hyperparathyroidism. Osteitis fibrosa cystica {{is associated with the}} development of <b>brown</b> <b>tumors,</b> which are rare because hyperparathyroidism is now usually diagnosed and treated before symptoms develop. <b>Brown</b> <b>tumors</b> are rarely the first symptom of hyperparathyroidism and can occasionally be mistaken for malignancy. Case Presentation: We herein report three cases of primary hyperparathyroidism with an unusual presentation of <b>brown</b> <b>tumors.</b> All three patients were Asian. In the first case, a 42 -year-old man was admitted with a mass mimicking a malignant bone neoplasm in the right mandible as the first manifestation of primary hyperparathyroidism. The second case involved a 25 -year-old man admitted with a fracture of his right femur. The third case involved a 43 -year-old man with multiple <b>brown</b> <b>tumors</b> in both lower limbs. All three patients underwent successful parathyroidectomy for parathyroid adenomas; one case was complicated by a papillary thyroid carcinoma.

40|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>tumor,</b> also {{referred}} as “Oteitis fibrosa cystica, ” is a focal lesion {{found within the}} areas of bone resorption {{as a result of}} diffused resorptive process of the bone resulting from hyper-parathyroidism.

40|$|Parathyroid {{carcinoma}} only represents < 1 % of {{all cases}} of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT).

40|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>tumor</b> arises as {{a direct}} result of the effect of {{parathyroid}} hormone on bone tissue in some patients with hyperparathyroidism. The lesion localizes in areas of intense bone resorbtion, and the bone defect becomes filled with fibroblastic tissue that can deform the bone and simulate a neoplastic process. Brown tumors can affect the mandible, maxilla, clavicle, ribs and pelvic bones. Most patients with hyperparathyroidism are asymptomatic. Skeletal changes may represent the first manifestations of the disease. Radiologically, <b>brown</b> <b>tumor</b> in the jaws presents as a well-defined radiolucent osteolytic lesion, making it hard to differentiate it from other maxillary expansive lesions that can present with a similar imaging. Brown tumors exhibit no pathognomonic histologic changes. Differentiating between a <b>brown</b> <b>tumor</b> and other giant-cell tumors may be very difficult, even with histology. A final diagnosis can be defined only by evaluating the radiological findings with histopathological, laboratory and clinical data. At present, <b>brown</b> <b>tumor</b> is considered as a reparative cellular process rather than a real neoplasia. This phenomenon is considered as pathognomonic of hyperparathyroidism secondary to renal failure, especially in patients on long-term hemodialysis.
