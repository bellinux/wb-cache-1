30|$|In the SNR analysis, {{only the}} {{geometrical}} {{component of the}} signal was considered and not any effects originating from the surface composition and antenna response, which can change the phase of the reflected signal (see [32]). Similarly, for the phase delay analysis, signal phase change from the reflection, e.g., carrier phase wind-up [33], and antenna phase center variations were not taken into account. Therefore, the results derived from the two analysis methods were not compared in an absolute sense. Instead, relative GNSS sea level time series were compared to the independent sea level observations from the co-located tide gauge. The tide gauge consisted of three pressure sensors (see Section 2). In a comparison with a pneumatic <b>bubbler</b> <b>gauge,</b> installed after this campaign, {{it was found that}} all three pressure sensors showed systematic errors (see [34]). However, one of the sensors showed only minor errors, and therefore, that sensor was used as the reference tide gauge in this study.|$|E
40|$|Measuring {{sea level}} {{has been of}} {{interest}} in Sweden since {{the discovery of the}} land uplift and today one reason for measurements is the current climate change. By accurately measuring the sea level, vulnerable coastlines can be detected at an early stage and appropriate measures can be taken. The two types of sensors, radar and pneumatic <b>bubbler</b> <b>gauge,</b> that are mounted at the tide gauge well at Onsala Space Observatory both have a best case measurement uncertainty of 3 mm. This report will study another method based on an optical distance sensor, a laser, that will be a complement to the other two. Before an implementation of such an optical distance sensor the devices accuracy have to be examined. Given the specifications of the wells dimensions measurements related to repeatability, linearity and temperature depence will be carried out. The report conclude that an optical distance sensor has the smallest standard deviation of the three sensors, based on an experiment lasting slighly longer than one day, and that no significant temperature dependence can be found. The laser will sample the reflected light from a reflector that floats on the water surface. Calculations show that this reflector has insignificant impact on the total measurement accuracy. Therefore an optical distance sensor is a useful alternative to the already mounted sensors at Onsala Space Observatory for measuring the sea level...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{collision}} between a BTZ black hole and a test particle coupled to a scalar field. We compute the power spectrum, the energy radiated and the plunging waveforms for this process. We show that for late times the signal {{is dominated by}} the quasinormal ringing. In terms of the AdS/CFT correspondence the bulk gravity process maps into a thermal state, an expanding <b>bubble</b> and <b>gauge</b> particles decaying into bosons of the associated operator. These latter thermalize in a timescale predicted by the bulk theory. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures;minor improvements; references adde...|$|R
40|$|Housing-bubble discussions {{generally}} rely on indirect barometers such {{as rapidly}} increasing prices, unrealistic expectations of future price increases, and rising ratios of housing price indexes to household income indexes. These indirect measures cannot answer {{the key question}} of whether housing prices are justified by the anticipated cash flow. We show how to estimate the fundamental value of a house and use unique rent and price data for matched single-family homes in ten metropolitan areas to illustrate this approach. These data indicate that the current housing bubble is not, in fact, a bubble {{in most of these}} cities in that, under a variety of plausible assumptions, buying a house at current market prices still appears to be an attractive long-term investment. Our results also demonstrate the flaw in models that <b>gauge</b> <b>bubbles</b> by comparing movements in housing price indexes to movements in other indexes or to values predicted by regression models. 1 Bubble, Bubble, Where’s the Housing Bubble? U. S. housing prices have risen by about 50 % in the past five years, and more than 100 % in some hot markets. Many knowledgeable observers believe {{that we are in the}} midst of...|$|R
40|$|Introduction of a {{temporally}} periodic {{pressure field}} within a fluid can induce forced oscillations to bubbles present therein. The resultant [radial] bubble dynamics are a complex function of several parameters, including the driving pressure amplitude, and proximity to nearby boundaries, such as vessel walls, or indeed, other <b>bubbles.</b> Recently, experimentation <b>gauged</b> towards {{the development of}} a quantitative understanding of [acoustically] driven bubbles of micrometer dimensions, especially when close to boundaries, has become a challenge of heightened academic and industrial interest. In pursuit of this, the present authors pioneered a new approach to such measurements that exploits optical trapping to locate microbubbles at prescribed displacements from a boundary [1, 2]. Here, we extend our previous method and report the first comprehensive study that has observed the dynamical behavior of isolated single micro-bubbles (the commercially available ultrasound contrast agent: SonoVue) that had been optically trapped over a range of well-defined displacements from a rigid boundary. All of the measurements were conducted at a mechanical index (MI) > 3. We noted a distinct variance in micro-bubble behavior across all quiescent radii and stand-off parameter, and also correlated bubble outcome statistics with measured radial dynamics. Finally, we suggest that the procedure outlined can be exploited to design ‘next-generation’ microbubbles with specific response characteristics...|$|R
