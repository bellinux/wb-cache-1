5|$|Because Irenaeus saw {{the purpose}} of the world to be the {{development}} of the moral character of humans, he believed that a good world would be best suited to that purpose. Irenaeaus believed that this world would include some suffering and evil to help people draw closer to God. He perceived God's declaration in the Book of Genesis that his creation was good to mean that the world is fit for purpose, rather than being free from suffering. To illustrate the benefits of suffering, Irenaeus cited the Biblical example of Jonah, from the Book of Jonah. His suffering, being swallowed by a whale, <b>both</b> <b>enabled</b> God's plan to be fulfilled and also brought Jonah closer to God: Jonah ended up repenting for his sin and the people of Nineveh turn to God.|$|E

50|$|As {{there is}} a deaf {{community}} with its own language and culture, so {{there is a}} cultural frame in which to be deaf is not to be infirm or disabled. To the contrary, it is an asset of and for the deaf community to be deaf in behavior, values, knowledge and fluency in sign language. It is within this community bonded by shared culture and language that lives defined by diagnosis, disadvantages imposed by majority beliefs and practices, and disabilities tied to inappropriate models of language and social enrichment, that, according to the cultural model of deafness, deaf people find themselves <b>both</b> <b>enabled</b> and socially advantaged. The experience of a language minority such as the deaf thus seen, amounts to a social disadvantage no more or less troubling than it would be for any language minority. In terms of its effect on mental health, deaf cultural attitudes conclude that a minority language group's disadvantages are preferred to a lifetime of viewing one's self or one's group as infirm or disabled.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the turn}} of the century (particularly during the years 1919 to 1923), Singaporean land {{reclamation}} was primarily the result of a need for increased public utilities (including the construction of transport links, such as roads and railways) and military coastal protection. This development largely continued until World War II, when the Japanese occupied Singapore. The Japanese directed focus away from an improved Singapore and towards an extended Japanese culture, establishing a Japanese school and showing Japanese propaganda films in cinemas. There was thus a low rate of industrialization in Singapore during this period, a lull which continued throughout the 1950s and early 1960s (during which time Singapore experienced extensive political change) until the city-state’s participation in the founding of Malaysia in 1963., As part of Malaysia (and continuing after independence in 1965), Singapore benefitted from economic development programs, which <b>both</b> <b>enabled</b> and required significant land reclamation projects. The city-state experienced a rapidly-increasing demand for industrial, infrastructural, commercial, and residential land, resulting in projects that reclaimed hundreds of hectares at a time. The [...] Jurong Industrial Estate began development in the early 1960s to meet industrial land needs, and by 1968 already housed 153 factories, with 46 in the midst of the construction process. Little, however, remains of the original Jurong, with much of the area’s original geography restricted to the areas around the Pandan Reservoir and Sungei Pandan. At around the same time as the development of the Jurong Industrial Estate, Singapore’s central business district (CBD) was similarly extended into land reclaimed from the sea. In this manner, Singapore’s weak economy was transformed through post-war industrialization and land reclamation.|$|E
