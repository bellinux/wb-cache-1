5|$|After a brief {{exchange}} of fire, their crews ran both French ships onshore {{close to the}} mouth of the River Dives, where several of the landing barges that had survived the attack on the British-held Îles Saint-Marcouf were sheltering. Confiante was badly damaged and boarding parties from Hydra and the other ships were able to board and burn her the following morning. Vésuve had suffered less than the Confiante and troops onshore were able to protect her from further attack until her crew could <b>bring</b> <b>her</b> into the nearby harbour of Sallenelles. There she was repaired and eventually she returned to Le Havre.|$|E
5|$|By July 1929 {{the last}} of the {{superstructure}} had been cleared, and Bremse was turned upside down using techniques developed on salvaging some of the destroyers.

She had started coaching L'Estartit's youth teams the previous season. Difficulties with her visa and commitments with the Mexico national team eventually reduced Domínguez's playing time with UE L'Estartit.

5|$|Her role as {{a troubled}} nun in the Powell and Pressburger {{production}} of Black Narcissus in 1947 did indeed <b>bring</b> <b>her</b> {{to the attention of}} Hollywood producers. The film was a hit in the US, as well as the UK, and Kerr won the New York Film Critics' Award as Actress of the Year. British exhibitors voted her the eighth-most popular local star at the box office. Soon she received the first of her Academy Award nominations for Edward, My Son, a 1949 drama set in England that co-starred Spencer Tracy.|$|E

5|$|In {{her early}} to mid-thirties, {{she became a}} lady-in-waiting (nyōbō) at court, most likely because of her {{reputation}} as an author. Chieko Mulhern writes in Japanese Women Writers, a Biocritical Sourcebook that scholars have wondered why Murasaki made such a move at a comparatively late period in her life. Her diary evidences that she exchanged poetry with Michinaga after her husband's death, leading to speculation that the two may have been lovers. Bowring sees no evidence that she was brought to court as Michinaga's concubine, although he did <b>bring</b> <b>her</b> to court without following official channels. Mulhern thinks Michinaga wanted to have Murasaki at court to educate his daughter Shōshi.|$|E

5|$|Lombard {{was eager}} to win an Academy Award, and {{selected}} her next project—from several possible scripts—with the expectation that it would <b>bring</b> <b>her</b> the trophy. Vigil in the Night (1940), directed by George Stevens, featured Lombard as a nurse who faces a series of personal difficulties. Although the performance was praised, she did not get her nomination, as the sombre mood of the picture turned audiences away and box-office returns were poor. Despite the realization that she was best suited to comedies, Lombard completed one more drama: They Knew What They Wanted (1940), co-starring Charles Laughton, which was mildly successful.|$|E
