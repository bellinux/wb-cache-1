25|$|Nearly all DAPs {{consists}} {{of some kind}} of display screen, although there are exceptions, such as the iPod Shuffle, and a set of controls with which the user can <b>browse</b> <b>through</b> the library of music contained in the device, select a track, and play it back. The display, if the unit even has one, can be anything from a simple one or two line monochrome LCD display, similar to what are found on typical pocket calculators, to large, high-resolution, full-color displays capable of displaying photographs or viewing video content on. The controls can range anywhere from the simple buttons as are found on most typical CD players, such as for skipping through tracks or stopping/starting playback to full touch-screen controls, such as that found on the iPod Touch or the Zune HD. One of the more common methods of control is some type of the scroll wheel with associated buttons. This method of control was first introduced with the Apple iPod and many other manufacturers have created variants of this control scheme for their respective devices.|$|E

25|$|The Rock Band Network is a {{downloadable}} {{content service}} designed by Harmonix and Microsoft to allow artists and labels to author ("chart") their own songs for play in Rock Band. Using special software provided by Harmonix, these songs are peer-reviewed for content before {{being put on}} the Network, and users {{will be able to}} <b>browse</b> <b>through</b> the available songs by several means. The Network will augment the songs added by Harmonix as downloadable content for the game. The Network became publicly available to Xbox 360 players on March 4, 2010, with all of the songs immediately available to the Network Store for Xbox 360, and certain selections of songs available to the PlayStation 3 and Wii. A major update of the Network was released early in 2011, after Rock Band 3 release, to including authoring tools for normal and Pro keyboards and vocal harmonies, but will not initially support Pro guitar/bass authoring until Harmonix is able to judge the support required for these tools. Harmonix also plans to better support the PlayStation 3 through this iteration. Due to lack of interest and difficulties with Nintendo's Wii storefront, Harmonix has discontinued making Network songs available for the Wii. Xbox 360 players will still be able to create and add songs to the Rock Band Network following the April 2, 2013 end of regular DLC, but Harmonix has stated that while these mechanisms are generally automated, they are based on third-party technology like Microsoft XNA, and should those services cease, so will the functionality of the Network. As release of Network songs for the PlayStation 3 require Harmonix to be fully involved, no further Network songs will be available for the PlayStation 3 after April 2, 2013. The Network was fully shuttered in September 2014 to allow Harmonix to move forward on other projects. Rock Band Network songs are incompatible with Rock Band 4 at launch; however, Harmonix has stated they will explore the logistics of bringing RBN songs into Rock Band 4 after completing the transition of all official DLC, packs, and disc exports.|$|E

40|$|This article investigates a new, {{effective}} browsing approach called metabrowsing. It is {{an alternative}} for current information retrieval systems, which still face six prominent difficulties. We identify and classify the difficulties and show that the metabrowsing approach alleviates the difficulties associated with query formulation and missing domain knowledge. Metabrowsing is a high-level way of <b>browsing</b> <b>through</b> information: instead of <b>browsing</b> <b>through</b> document contents or document surrogates, the user <b>browses</b> <b>through</b> a graphical representation of the documents and their relations to the domain. The approach requires other cognitive skills from the user than what is currently required. Yet, a user evaluation in which the metabrowsing system was compared with an ordinary query-oriented system showed only some small indicatory differences in effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction. We expect that more experience with metabrowsing {{will result in a}} significantly better performance difference. Hence, our conclusion is that the development of new cognitive skills requires some time before the technologies are ready to be used...|$|R
