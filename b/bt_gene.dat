40|$|Background: There are {{different}} kinds of Bt corn, * depending on which <b>Bt</b> <b>genes</b> have been inserted into the corn using molecular engineering. Some <b>Bt</b> <b>genes</b> protect against stalk borers, others help prevent leaf and ear damage from various caterpillars including corn earworm and fall armyworm. Still other genes protect the roots from western corn rootworm. These genes are bundled together in various combinations, with or without herbicide tolerance <b>genes.</b> <b>Bt</b> corn is really a form of crop insurance that comes in the seed bag. The presence {{of one or more}} <b>Bt</b> <b>genes</b> in a corn hybrid will not increase yield potential. Instead, the gene(s) prevent yield losses from certain insects. Therefore, {{the most important thing to}} remember is that if the population of the target insect in your field or area is high enough, Bt corn will pay off. If the “insect pressure ” is not there, then you won’t get your money back. So it is a matter of deciding if the risk is high enough to warrant purchasing “insurance. ” This information sheet summarizes the results from replicated trials conducted in summer 2011 at eight Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station locations.

Once a crop has been harvested, the field is plowed under {{as soon as possible}} to stop the life cycle of the new generation of bollworm. Unharvested bolls harbor the larvae, so these are destroyed. The plants are plowed into the earth and the fields are irrigated liberally to drown out remaining pests. Some farmers burn the stubble after harvest. Surviving bollworms will overwinter in the field and re-infest the following season.

40|$|Abstract Potato, Solanum tuberosum L., {{is one of}} the world’s {{principal}} food crops. Important potato {{insect pests}} include Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say, potato tuberworm, Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller), and aphids, especially as they transmit potato leafroll virus and potato virus Y. Management of insect pests of potato relies almost entirely on chemical insecticides. Potato breeding is complicated by the potato’s tetraploidy. Numerous Solanum spp. have resistance to insects but these properties have not been transferred into commercially desirable cultivars. Insect-resistant cultivars are generally not available. GM potatoes expressing resistance to L. decemlineata, potato virus Y, and potato leaf roll virus were registered and marketed in the USA from 1995 – 2000, but were withdrawn from the market in response to marketing concerns about GM crops. Bacillus thuringiensis (<b>Bt)</b> <b>genes</b> for resistance to various insect pests are likely candidates for inclusion into potatoes using genetic engineering.

40|$|Has the {{introduction}} of <b>Bt</b> <b>genes</b> into the cotton plant affected its c pa ity for compensation after insect damage? This question is relevant for three reasons. First, and most obviously, Bt cottons remain vulnerable to non-lepidopteran pests, including thrips and mirids. Second, they are susceptible to Helicover a spp. when Bt efficacy drops because of crop ageing. Third, under some (yet undefined) environmental conditions, Bt efficacy can be low even in young crops, {{and we have seen}} fruit shedding in young commercial Bt crops that has been attributed to Helicoverpa damage. We assessed the degree of tolerance of Bt cotton to actual and simulated insect damage in three field experiments carried out at ACRI in 1996 / 97. Yield and maturity responses to damage of Bt cottons compared well with those of conventional varieties.

These animals were housed in metabolism cages, with collector and separator feces and urine for 21 days, comprising 8 days for diet adaptation and 7 days for determination of intake, followed by 6 days of collection of feces, to measure DMI (g/day), CDA DM, CP and NDF. Samples of feed offered, leftovers and feces were identified and placed in a circulating air oven maintained at 55 °C to constant weight. The analyses were performed in Bromatological Analysis Laboratory of the Institute of Animal Science. To CTMS (g/day) was interaction effect (p 0. 05) from your counterpart DKBBt with the gene (590. 78). The lowest total DM intake in g/day was observed for varieties with <b>Bt</b> <b>gene</b> insertion (genetically modified organism - GMO) and a possible explanation is the higher value of NDF in the silages of variety with the <b>Bt</b> <b>gene</b> in relation to their isogenic counterparts without the gene. The CDA, DM and NDF no had interaction effect between varieties factors and GMO (p> 0. 05) confirming the values found by several authors in studies with sheep fed to corn silage.

The inbred lines were evaluated using PCR amplification, test paper evaluation, insect resistance evaluation in both the laboratory and paddy fields, nursery evaluation of rice blast resistance and pedigree selection of agronomic traits. Larval mortalities on Bt 5198 and Bt Minghui 63 were 100 % when rice culms were inoculated with the eggs of the striped stem borer (SSB) in the laboratory. Bt 5198 was highly resistant against SSB and the yellow stem borer (YSB) under field conditions. The F 1 hybrids derived from Bt 5198 and four cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) lines were also highly resistant to SSB and YSB and had a significant heterosis.

40|$|Background: Transgenic plants inhabiting single <b>Bt</b> <b>gene</b> {{are prone}} to develop insect {{resistance}} and this resistance {{has been reported in}} case of some important yield-devastating insect larvae of commercial crops, such as cotton and rice. Therefore, it has become essential to adapt new strategies to overcome the problem of insect resistance and these new strategies should be sophisticated enough to target such resistant larvae in broad spectrum. Among these, plants may be transformed with <b>Bt</b> <b>gene</b> tagged with some fusion-protein gene that possesses lectin-binding capability to boost the binding sites for crystal protein gene within insect mid-gut in order to overcome any chances of insect tolerance against Bt toxin. Enhanced chloroplast-targeted <b>Bt</b> <b>gene</b> expression can also help in the reduction of insect resistance. Results: In the present investigation, a combined effect of both these strategies was successfully used in cotton (G. hirsutum). For this purpose, plant expression vector pKian- 1 was created, after a series of cloning steps, carrying Cry 1 Ac gene ligated with chloroplast transit peptide towards N-terminal and Ricin B-Chain towards C-terminal, generating TP-Cry 1 Ac-RB construct. Conclusions: Efficacy of pKian- 1 plasmid vector was confirmed by in-planta Agrobacterium-mediated leaf GUS assay in tobacco. Cotton (G. hirsutum) local variety MNH- 786 was transformed with pKian- 1 and the stable integration of TP-Cry 1 Ac-RB construct in putative transgenic plants was confirmed by PCR; while fusion-protein expression in cytosol as well as chloroplast was substantiated by Western blot analysis.

40|$|Transgenic {{resistance}} to insects {{has been demonstrated}} in plants expressing insecticidal genes such as δ -endotoxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), protease inhibitors, enzymes, secondary plant metabolites, and plant lectins. While transgenic plants with introduced <b>Bt</b> <b>genes</b> have been deployed in several crops on a global scale, the alternative genes have received considerably less attention. The protease inhibitor and lectin genes largely affect insect growth and development and, in most instances, do not result in insect mortality. The effective concentrations of these proteins are {{much greater than the}} Bt toxin proteins. Therefore, the potential of some of the alternative genes can only be realized by deploying them in combination with conventional host plant resistance and <b>Bt</b> <b>genes.</b> Genes conferring {{resistance to}} insects can also be deployed as multilines or synthetic varieties. Initial indications from deployment of transgenics with insect resistance in diverse cropping systems in USA, Canada, Argentina, China, India, Australia, and South Africa suggest that single transgene products in standard cultivar backgrounds are not a recipe for sustainable pest management. Instead, a much more complex approach may be needed, one which may involve deployment of a combination of different transgenes in different backgrounds. Under diverse climatic conditions and cropping systems of tropics, the success in the utilization of transgenics for pest management may involve decentralized national breeding programs and several small-scale seed companies. While several transgenic crops with insecticidal genes have been introduced in the temperate regions, very little has been done to use this technology for improving crop productivity in the harsh environments of the tropics, where the need for increasing food production is most urgent.
