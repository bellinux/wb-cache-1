50|$|Sepsis {{occurs in}} 1-2% of all hospitalizations and {{accounts}} {{for as much}} as 25% of ICU <b>bed</b> <b>utilization.</b> Due to it rarely being reported as a primary diagnosis (often being a complication of cancer or other illness), the incidence, mortality, and morbidity rates of sepsis are likely underestimated. A study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of selected States found that there were approximately 651 hospital stays per 100,000 population with a sepsis diagnosis in 2010. It is the second-leading cause of death in non-coronary intensive care unit (ICU) patients and the tenth-most-common cause of death overall (the first being heart disease). Children under 12 months of age and elderly people have the highest incidence of severe sepsis. Among U.S. patients who had multiple sepsis hospital admissions in 2010, those who were discharged to a skilled nursing facility or long term care following the initial hospitalization {{were more likely to be}} readmitted than those discharged to another form of care. A study of 18 U.S. States found that, amongst Medicare patients in 2011, septicemia was the second most common principal reason for readmission within 30 days.|$|E
40|$|Background: Hospital <b>bed</b> <b>utilization</b> is {{influenced}} by various factors which {{can be divided into}} patient, physician and administration related. These factors {{can be seen from the}} perspective of Nursing staff as they are biggest human resource of any healthcare organization. Any improvement initiative taken by the administration be matched with the nurses perception which ultimately affect the hospital efficiency and quality of care. Aim and Objective: To ascertain the factors influencing hospital <b>bed</b> <b>utilization</b> from the perspective of Nurses. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted in an apex tertiary care public institution in northern region of India. All the nurses in the 14 wards of different specialties were interviewed using a structured validated self administered questionnaire. Statistical analysis: The data was analyzed using statistical software SPSS version 16, by percentages, mean scores and chi-square test. Results: A total of 162 nurses were enrolled in the study. The factors significantly influencing <b>bed</b> <b>utilization</b> with regard to nurses are patient (1. 97, 0. 40), physician (1. 97, 0. 46), administrative (2. 39, 0. 40). Conclusion: With changing healthcare trends in recent past (innovations in policy decisions, technological advances, business sustainability aspect, quality initiatives etc.), gave an insight to policy makers (administrators) to consider the perception of Nurses (human resource) regarding <b>bed</b> <b>utilization</b> as an important component of healthcare delivery system...|$|E
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of high surgical bed occupancy levels in Vancouver Island Health Authority (VIHA) hospitals, staff stress levels, surgical cancellations and wait times for surgeries were becoming problematic. In collaboration with VIHA management and through site visits, interviews, and data analyses, we found that this congestion was in part attributable to current surgical scheduling practices which focussed on efficient use of the operating rooms but ignored the downstream <b>bed</b> <b>utilization</b> patterns caused by these schedules. We developed two tools, the <b>Bed</b> <b>Utilization</b> Simulator (BUS) and the Surgical Scheduling Optimizer (SSO) to improve current scheduling practices. BUS is a Monte Carlo simulation model written in Visual Basic for Applications in MS Excel that predicts inpatient <b>bed</b> <b>utilization</b> patterns for a specified surgical schedule entered through a graphical interface. This highly portable model imports historical patient records from hospital information systems to accurately represent historical patient mix when assessing schedules. SSO is a mixed integer programming model developed to provide schedules, as well as scheduling principles, that achieve minimal day to day variation in ward occupancy. Surgical planners could then use BUS to assess and revise these schedules, to account for factors not captured in SSO. These tools have been used on a “What if? ” basis t...|$|E

40|$|A model {{relating}} <b>bed</b> {{supply and}} <b>utilization</b> {{is presented in}} the context of the match between need and service, which is controlled by the screening process that allows or denies access to beds. The conventional cost-minimization approach to certification of need, that of seeking to reduce inappropriate use, is contrasted with a service-delivery approach that seeks to promote appropriate use of facilities. The model expresses the quality of the screening process and the sensitivity and specificity of utilization in terms of <b>bed</b> supply, <b>utilization,</b> and need for service, which allows it to be used for needs assessment. The model is applied to data on supply and use of beds in Massachusetts skilled nursing facilities, with screening quality estimated by Monte Carlo methods; the results suggest that need and bed supply are positively associated and that the regional variation in skilled-nursing beds in Massachusetts may reflect real variations in need...|$|R
40|$|Background: Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are a {{cornerstone}} of malaria control at present, and millions are used each day across the globe. However, there is limited information about the durability of LLINs under different conditions of utilization {{and there is no}} consensus about when a LLIN ceases to be protective due to physical deterioration. This knowledge is important for malaria control programmes to plan for procurement and replacement. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 208 households where Olyset® nets distributed five years ago were still present was conducted in the village of Sauri, western Kenya, {{in the context of the}} Millennium Villages Project. Information on <b>bed</b> net <b>utilization</b> and maintenance was collected in each household through a structured questionnaire, and one five-year-old Olyset® net from each sampled household was randomly selected and collected for physical examination. All holes larger than 0. 5 cm were measured in each net, registering their position, and a hole index was calculated following WHO guidelines. Nets were classified as in good condition, moderately damaged or badly torn based on the hole index. The analysis explored the associations between demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of households, patterns of <b>bed</b> net <b>utilization</b> and maintenance and physical condition of the nets. Additional analysis was conducted using malaria prevalence data collected in a separate survey to explore if there was any association between the condition of the net collected in a household and the presence of malaria parasites in members of that household. Results: 81. 4 % of Olyset® nets distributed five years ago were still present in the surveyed households, and 98. 97 % of the nets were reportedly used the previous night. Nets had an average of 34. 2 holes (95 % CI 30. 12 - 38. 22), and the mean hole index was 849 (95 % CI 711 – 986), IQR 174 – 1, 135. 15. 2 % of nets were still in good condition, 46. 1 % were moderately damaged and 38. 7 % were badly torn after five years of utilization. There was no association between household characteristics or patterns of <b>bed</b> net <b>utilization</b> or maintenance and physical condition of the nets. The only predictor of the physical condition of the net was the cleanliness at the time of examination. There was a difference of 17. 6 percentage points in the proportion of households with at least one blood smear positive for Plasmodium falciparum between households with a net in good condition (5. 3 %) and those with a moderately damaged or badly torn net (22. 9 %), 95 % CI (0. 04 - 0. 305), t= 2. 77 with unequal variance, p= 0. 009. Conclusions: Olyset® nets were used extensively in Sauri, western Kenya after five years of distribution, regardless of their physical condition. However, only 15 % were found in good condition. Nets in good condition seem to be still protective after five years of utilization, while nets with more than 100 cm 2 of holed surface may be associated with higher malaria parasitaemia at household level. Continued replacement of damaged nets and promotion of net maintenance and repair may be necessary to maintain the protective effectiveness of LLINs...|$|R

40|$|Background: Childhood {{morbidity}} consumes {{a substantial}} portion of health care resources in terms of hospital <b>bed</b> <b>utilization,</b> and overload in hospital ward remains a major concern in many countries, including India. A possible way to minimize the problem of scarcities of bed is to analyze the pattern of <b>bed</b> <b>utilization</b> by causes and plan services accordingly. Objectives: To determine the burden of pediatric morbidity and utilization pattern of pediatric beds in a tertiary care hospital. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of pediatric inpatient′s records was conducted over a period of 1 year from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2007. Results: Of 3983 total admitted cases, about one-third were infants, of which neonatal and post-neonatal age group constituted 45 % and 55 % of the cases, respectively. In terms of bed-day utilization, infants, 1 - 4 years and 5 - 11 years age group accounted for 35. 10 %, 32. 58 % and 32. 32 % of total days of admission, respectively. Utilization of pediatric beds by major causes of morbidity was respiratory tract infection (22. 23 %), convulsive disorder (12. 68 %), accident and poisoning (6. 07 %), diarrheal disease (4. 97 %) and chronic hemolytic anemia (4. 42 %).

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine the characteristics of sawdust and cocopeat bedding materials, including physicochemical properties (Exp. I) and on-farm trial (Exp. II). In Exp. I, the proportion of particle size was in the order of sawdust> cocopeat India>cocopeat Vietnam (p cocopeat Vietnam>sawdust (p< 0. 05), thus cocopeat treatments showed 4. 4 times higher bedding cost than sawdust. The water absorption rates were 702. 0 % in cocopeat India, 678. 3 % in cocopeat Vietnam, and 444. 0 % in sawdust, showing cocopeat had approximately 1. 5 times higher water absorption rate than sawdust. Moisture evaporation rates after 12 h of air blowing (2. 00 m/s) were higher (p< 0. 05) in cocopeat Vietnam (80. 4 %) than sawdust (71. 2 %) and cocopeat India (72. 8 %). In vitro ammonia emissions were higher (p< 0. 05) in sawdust (2. 71 mg/m 2 /h) than cocopeat India (1. 59 mg/m 2 /h) and Vietnam (1. 22 mg/m 2 /h), and total ammonia emissions were higher (p< 0. 05) in sawdust (37. 02 mg/m 2) than cocopeat India (22. 51 mg/m 2) and Vietnam (13. 60 mg/m 2). In Exp. II, an on-farm trial was conducted with 48 Hanwoo cattle in 16 pens using the same bedding materials as in Exp. I, with fan (blowing 2. 00 m/s) and no fan treatments, and feed bunk side (FB) and water supply side (WS) within a pen (4. 5 m, width× 9. 0 m, length). Beddings were replaced with fresh bedding materials when moisture concentrations were over 65 %. No interactions among treatments were detected for moisture concentration and increment rates, and ammonia concentrations, but a significant effect was observed (p< 0. 01) for each of the treatments. Both concentrations and increment rate of moisture were higher (p< 0. 01) in the beddings without fan than with fan. Moisture concentrations and increment rate within a pen were also higher (p< 0. 01) in FB than WS. Thus, the whole no-fan-FB and sawdust-fan-FB were replaced with fresh bedding material between 4 to 5 experimental weeks. The ammonia concentrations and pH of beddings were not significantly different among treatments. Therefore, using cocopeat bedding with a blowing fan can extend twice the <b>bedding</b> <b>utilization</b> period, and WS within a pen showed twice the bedding-life compared to FB.

30|$|The {{effect of}} flow rate, (2, 4, 6  ml/min) of dye {{concentration}} 50  mg/L {{at a constant}} bed height of 5  cm was evaluated. As expected, the data showed faster and steeper breakthrough curve at higher flow rate. As the flow rate increases, the residence time in the bed decreases which resulted in lower <b>bed</b> <b>utilization.</b> Therefore, the breakthrough volume and the bed capacity will decrease with increasing flow rate. For lower value of flow rate, the contact time is longer and hence {{the interaction between the}} dye and the biomass is greater which leads to higher dye sorption. On the other hand, for higher flow rate, the contact time is shorter and the dye sorption is also lower due to lesser interact ion.|$|E

We conducted {{a national survey of}} TB specialized hospitals to determine hospitalization fees and hospital <b>bed</b> <b>utilization</b> in 1999, 2004, and 2009. Hospitalization of TB patients increased 185. 3 % from 1999 to 2009. While the average hospitalization fees also increased, the proportion of those fees in relation to GDP per capita decreased. Hospitalization fees differed across the three regions (eastern, central, and western). Using a least standard difference (LSD) paired analysis, in 2004, the difference in hospitalization fees was significant when comparing eastern and central provinces (p< 0. 001) as well as to western provinces (p< 0. 001). In 2009, the difference remained statistically significant when comparing eastern province hospitalization fees with central provinces (p< 0. 001) and western provinces (p = 0. 008). In 2004 and 2009, the cost associated with hospitalization as a proportion of GDP per capita was highest in the western region. The average in-patient stay decreased from 33 days in 1999 to 26 and 27 days in 2004 and 2009 respectively. Finally, hospital <b>bed</b> <b>utilization</b> in all three regions increased over this period.

40|$|Managing scarce {{resources}} plays {{a significant role}} in hospital operations. Effective use of resources (e. g., operating rooms, specialized doctors, etc.) allows hospitals to efficiently provide high-quality care to patients. In this dissertation, we study how hospitals manage {{scarce resources}} to identify systematic ways in which quality of care and efficiency might be improved. We study four different types of hospital resources: post-operative beds, specialist surgeons, resident physicians, and patient information. For each resource type, we show how better utilization could increase the quality of care delivered by the hospital or increase the efficiency of the system. We show that as post-operative <b>bed</b> <b>utilization</b> increases the discharge rate increases as well, meaning that bed shortages impact physician decision making. Further, we show that patients discharged on days with high <b>bed</b> <b>utilization</b> are significantly more likely to be readmitted to the hospital within 72 hours, which implies that poor bed management can lead to worse health outcomes for surgical patients. We also study how quality of care differs between night and day arrival in trauma centers. Based on a large national dataset, we conclude that a lack of specialized resources at hospitals during the off hours leads to significantly worse patient outcomes, including higher mortality and longer lengths of stay. Further, we exploit a natural experiment to determine the impact that residents have on efficiency in an academic emergency department. Using regression analysis, queueing models, and simulation, we find that when residents are present in the emergency department, treatment times are lowered significantly, especially among high severity patients. Finally, we show two novel uses of medical data to predict patient outcomes. We develop models to predict which patients will require an ICU bed after being transferred from outside hospitals to an internal medicine unit, using only five commonly measured medical characteristics of the patient. We also develop a model using MRI data to classify whether or not prostate cancer is present in an image...|$|E

It {{can be seen from}} the total of Bed Occupational Rate (BOR) in 2010 - 2011 is only 48. 52 % - 51. 65 % which is below the standard of Health Department that is 60 - 85 %. Method: This study is a analytical observational study with cross sectional approach. The Population are inpatients of Pelabuhan Hospital Palembang. The number of samples is 80. The research data were analyzed quantitatively by the method of univariate, bivariate with chi square analysis, and multivariate with logistic regression analysis using SPSS program. Result: The result of analysis tests of the relationship between marketing mix and the utilization of inpatient installation of Pelabuhan Hospital Palembang, from 7 variables of marketing mix, there are six variables that have a relationship to the utilization of inpatient installation, that are variable product (OR= 6, p-value=< 0, 0001), price (OR= 10, p-value=< 0, 0001), place (OR = 5, p-value= 0, 001), people (OR= 5, p-value= 0, 002), processes (OR= 7, p-value=< 0, 0001), and physical evidence (OR= 8, p-value=< 0, 0001). Based on the results of multivariate logistic regression analysis, there are four variables of marketing mix which are most influential, namely product (OR= 7, p-value= 0, 008), price (OR= 15, p-value= < 0, 0001), process(OR= 8, p-value= 0, 007) and physical evidence (OR= 18, p-value= < 0, 0001). Conclution: Pelabuhan Hospital Palembang needs to improve the its marketing by noticing the marketing mix variables affecting the utilization of inpatient installations, especially those still considered not good enough by the in-patients,that are person and physical evidence. The goal is to increase BOR of Pelabuhan Hospital Palembang due to Health Department standards...|$|R
40|$|Malaria is a {{major cause}} of {{morbidity}} and mortality among displaced populations in tropical zones. Bed nets are widely used to prevent malaria; however, few data are available on bed net distribution within displaced populations. Mixed methods study in a single internally displaced persons (IDP) camp and neighboring community in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Qualitative data (focus group discussions, FGDs) and quantitative data (door-to-door survey and individual testing using malaria rapid diagnostic test, RDT) were collected. Ten FGDs were conducted with 55 individuals. Although malaria was widely recognized as a significant threat and bed nets were freely distributed in the camp, many households did not own or use them. IDPs converged on the following reasons for low bed net ownership and use: inconvenience of net installation and sale of nets to meet immediate needs such as food. One hundred households, comprised of 411 individuals, were surveyed in Birambizo. The burden of malaria was high (45 / 78 (58 %) of children < 5 were positive for malaria by RDT) and <b>bed</b> net <b>utilization</b> was low (29 / 100 (29 %) households owned a bed net, and 85 / 411 (20 %) individuals slept under a bed net the previous night). Children < 5 were more likely to use a bed net than older children or adults (OR 3. 4 (95 %CI 2. 0 - 5. 8), p< 0. 0001). Compared to 29 bed nets currently in use by study participants, 146 bed nets had been sold (82 %) or exchanged (18 %) either in the camp (27 %) or in the neighbouring village market (73 %). Qualitative descriptions and quantitative analysis revealed pragmatic barriers to bed net usage and widespread sale of freely distributed bed nets within IDP camps, despite a high burden of malaria. Additional strategies, beyond bed net distribution, are warranted to combat malaria in vulnerable and hard-to-reach population...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} clinical need and hospital <b>bed</b> supply and <b>utilization</b> in Russia; and, to {{investigate the}}se associations in areaswhere traditional Russian tuberculosis health care systems exist and where the directly observed therapy–short course (DOTS) strategy has been imple-mented. Design: Ecological study using 2002 routine data. Main outcome measures: Hospital bed util-ization and hospital admissions for patients with tuberculosis in regions that adhere to the traditional Russian method of managing tuberculosis and those where the DOTS strategy has been implemented. Results: The ratio of beds per newly notified case was 0. 86. The mean duration of hospital stay per admission was 86 days for non-DOTS regions and 90 days for regions where the DOTS strategy had been implemented. The number of admissions in each region correlated closely {{with the number of}} newly registered cases and hospital beds were, on average, occupied for 325 days. In the regions where the DOTS strategy had been implemented bed occupancy was 324 days. Conclusions: Under the Russian tuberculosis control system, hospital utilization is predominantly determined by supply-side factors, namely the number of tuberculosis dedicated hospital beds, and this system extends across all regions. Implementation of the DOTS strategy in Russia has not led to fundamental structural changes in tuberculosis control systems...|$|R

40|$|The Stella Maris Hospital of Makassar, Indonesia {{has made}} various efforts in {{improving}} the quality of services to maximize profitability through the increasing of market share and cost containment. The financial cash flow within the year 2008 - 2010 indicates that the operating costs increased which is in contrast to the rate of <b>bed</b> <b>utilization</b> that decreased for the same period, that subsequently give impact to profitability. This paper is intended to analyze the relationship between cost of quality with profitability. The result indicates that the cost of quality has a significant relationship to the profitability. Partially, prevention and appraisal cost have a significant relationship to improve profitability, while the external failure costs have a significant relationship to lower profitability. Internal failure costs, on the other hand, have no significant relationship to the profitability. In conclusion, improving the allocation of prevention and appraisal costs will subsequently increase the profitability...|$|E
40|$|A descriptive, {{retrospective}} {{study of the}} socio-economic profile of the population seeking health services in a Northeastern region of the State of S. Paulo was carried out and the results {{compared with those of}} previous studies. A total of 126, 297 patients discharged from 25 general hospitals of the region in 1988 were studied according to sex, age group, residence, source of financing and hospital indicators. The results of this study show that the distribution of the demand according to sex and age is similar to that known from the relevant literature. These results suggest that the regionalization of assistance, in spite of planning and of pertinent legislation, is unsatisfactory, strongly influenced by the presence of large urban centers and socio-economic development. Various sources of financing are used together with a considerable increase of private health insurance and a diminishing participation of governmental institutions over the years. The region studied presents a high rate hospitalization as well as rate of hospital <b>bed</b> <b>utilization...</b>|$|E
40|$|AIMS: The {{palliative care}} has spread rapidly {{worldwide}} {{in the recent}} two decades. The development of hospice services in rural areas usually lags behind that in urban areas. The aim of our {{study was to investigate}} whether the urban-rural disparity widens in a country with a hospital-based hospice system. METHODS: From the nationwide claims database within the National Health Insurance in Taiwan, admissions to hospices from 2000 to 2006 were identified. Hospices and patients in each year were analyzed according to geographic location and residence. RESULTS: A total of 26, 292 cancer patients had been admitted to hospices. The proportion of rural patients to all patients increased with time from 17. 8 % in 2000 to 25. 7 % in 2006. Although the numbers of <b>beds</b> and the <b>utilizations</b> in both urban and rural hospices expanded rapidly, the increasing trend in rural areas was more marked than that in urban areas. However, still two-thirds (898 / 1, 357) of rural patients were admitted to urban hospices in 2006. CONCLUSIONS: The gap of hospice utilizations between urban and rural areas in Taiwan did not widen with time. There was room for improvement in sufficient supply of rural hospices or efficient referral of rural patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of 15 N into individual plasma amino acids and urea was quantified in five human subjects who received 15 NH 4 Cl either orally or intravenously for 6 h. After oral tracer administration, the highest enrichment {{was achieved by}} arginine, followed by urea and glutamine; distribution of 15 N within glutamine was 55 % amide and 45 % amino N. Glutamine achieved the highest enrichment after the intravenous administration of tracer, with a distribution of 92 % amide and 8 % amino N. The relative distribution pattern of 15 N incorporation was quantified from {{the rate at which}} 15 N initially appeared in each plasma component. Amino acids (especially arginine, glutamine, and glutamate) accounted for greater than one-half (54 %) of the orally administered tracer that was initially recovered in plasma components, compared with 46 % initial appearance for urea; for the intravenous tracer, amino acids accounted for 78 % of initial appearance of tracer compared with 22 % for urea. Our results highlight the involvement of the splanchnic <b>bed</b> in the <b>utilization</b> of orally administered ammonia (preferential {{incorporation of}} oral tracer into arginine, urea, glutamate, and the amino N of glutamine) in contrast to the preferential incorporation of systemically administered ammonia into the amide N of glutamine and alanine...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{growth in}} the demand for {{emergency}} medical services along with {{decline in the number}} of hospitals with emergency departments (EDs) has raised concerns about the ability of the EDs to provide adequate service. Many EDs frequently report periods of overcrowding during which they are forced to divert incoming ambulances to neighboring hospitals, a phenomenon known as “ambulance diversion”. This paper aims to study the impact of key structural characteristics of the hospitals such as the number of ED beds, the number of inpatient <b>beds,</b> and the <b>utilization</b> of inpatient <b>beds</b> on the extent to which hospitals go on ambulance diversion. We first develop a simple queueing network model to describe the patient flow between the ED and the inpatient department and analyze this model using heavy traffic approximation. We show that, for a pre-specified delay probability, the fraction of time that the ED goes on diversion is decreasing in the spare capacity of the inpatient department and in the size of the ED, where both are appropriately normalized for the size of the inpatient department. We then test these findings by estimating a selection model using publicly available cross-sectional data on California hospitals and find moderate support for our theoretical findings. We also find evidence that certain hospitals, owing to their location and ownership structure, are more likely to choose ambulance diversion to mitigate overcrowding than others. Key words: emergency department, empirical research, sample selection model, heavy traffic approximatio...|$|R
