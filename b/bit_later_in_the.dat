50|$|From the {{laboratory}} reconstructions of ancient RNases, it is shown {{that each of}} these traits was absent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most recent common ancestor of seminal and pancreatic RNase and a <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> arose <b>in</b> <b>the</b> seminal lineage after the divergence of the above two protein families. The RNase genes from all taxa in a true ruminant phylogenetic tree that was constructed by parsimony analysis were analyzed by the researchers, and they revealed that early after the gene duplication, pancreatic RNases and seminal RNases separated at about 35 million years ago (MYA). Several marker substitutions, including Pro 19, Cys 32 and Lys 62, have been introduced in seminal RNase genes which made them to be recognized as different from their pancreatic cousins. Based on this, the seminal RNase family includes the taxa called saiga, sheep, duiker, kudu and cape buffalo, while peccary has been excluded from it. Later on, from the sequence analyses, mass spectrophotometry and western blotting studies on taxa that comes under the seminal RNase gene family, it has been revealed that they are consistent with the model which assumes that immediately after duplication the seminal RNase gene gained a physiological function and this function has been continued throughout the divergent evolution (each copy of gene gets evolved independently) and later on it was lost in all other species including modern kudu and cape buffalo except in modern oxen. This would require, however, that this function was lost independently multiple times in different lineages.|$|R

In 2006, GoodNites underwent a revamp so that Kimberly-Clark could try to shed what it felt was a perceived image that their products were simply 'diapers for teenagers', with bedwetters up to 15-years-old being bullied for still having to wear diapers, which was considered 'babyish' or 'uncool'. In 2009, Kimberly-Clark once again revamped the GoodNites product line. New packaging featuring children's faces was advertised on the GoodNites website and released in April of that year. They have since often been marketed as 'pyjama pants', although some bedwetters chose to wear the diaper to bed without pyjamas.|$|R

50|$|Brown fish owls breed from November to April, with {{activity}} tending to peak a bit {{earlier in the}} north of their breeding range and a <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> more tropical south of their breeding range. The breeding season is concurrent with the dry season, which has the benefit of low water levels and thus crabs and fish being more readily assessible. However, most other owls and diurnal raptors also primarily breed in the dry season as well. As owls do not build nest, brown fish owls are somewhat opportunistic when it comes to nesting sites. Brown fish owls frequently nest in shady spots such as old-growth mango trees (Mangifera ssp.), fig trees, including Ficus religiosa and Ficus benghalensis, Shorea robusta and other large trees in lowland forests. Outside of the bare surface of large branches, nests are often in spots such as overgrown eroded ravines and steep riverbanks with natural holes. However, it may also nest near suitable villages, along wet roadsides, jheels, canals and rice fields. Usually nest are large natural holes, in hollows or at the base of large branches. Deserted nest built by fish eagles and vultures are also sometimes used as nesting locations. Other nesting sites have included rock ledges, caves in shady cliff faces and stone ruins. The clutch is two or occasionally just one egg. 10 eggs in India averaged 58.4 x 48.9 mm in sizes, with eggs of fish owls to the north averaging slightly larger. Incubation is 38 days or somewhat less, and the young fledge after about 7 weeks. The downy chicks are mostly an off-white color and develop into a paler version of adults by their second year.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{scholars}} {{have discussed the}} way the author has looked to the Psalms for inspiration and material for the work. James Kugel discusses how the work twice alludes to Psalm 137 and how the modifications may be considered [...] "an early form of biblical interpretation." [...] There are actually two allusions, {{the first of which}} Kugel styles [...] "Babylonians Blasphemously Demand Songs."As Kugel explains, the [...] "resting themselves" [...] in the earlier Coptic version is presumably an explanation of [...] "we sat down" [...] in the psalm - that is to say, [...] "we sat down in order to rest." [...] However, it is the second allusion a <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> work that is more interesting. Here, in what Kugel styles [...] "Levites Ascend to Heaven," [...] we learn that it is only the Levites that are charged with singing. Not only that, but [...] "when they do so they immediately begin to ascend into heaven, a miraculous ascent that leads the onlookers to think that the return from exile has begun, as the palace walls and the very heavens resound with God's praise." [...] The author is here trying to deal with the question, [...] "How can we sing a song of the Lord and still remain in a foreign land?" [...] and secondarily with the question of why the harps are [...] "hung up," [...] stressing the meaning of [...] "above." [...] In Kugel's determination, [...] "the passage presents a rather different reading of Psalm 137, one unattested in our rabbinic sources and which may therefore represent a relatively ancient grappling with this psalm's wording." [...] In a similar fashion, Rosenstiehl looks at chapter 29 of the work and sees therein a commentary on Psalm 133, which interprets the psalm {{in the light of the}} Jewish Day of Atonement, in particular evoking part of the ceremony of this holy day, one of the most important of post-exilic Israel. He concludes that this work [...] "illustrates the technique of the commentary as it is practiced in the intertestamental period: the text, stripped from the Psalm is glossed, explained in the light of legendary data and amplified." ...|$|E

50|$|Jordan and others’ {{study found}} a very {{interesting}} effect of the larval ingestion of PAs. Male Estigmene acrea moths that consumed PAs in their diet as larvae produced hydroxydanaidal, a volatile PA compound, and displayed their coremata: a bifid, inflatable male-specific organ, utilized in dispersing pheromones in the adult stage. Larvae that were fed diets without PAs rarely displayed their coremata and did not produce hydroxydanaidal. E. acrea have been observed in the wild displaying their coremata, an activity which attracts {{both males and females}} and is known as lekking. Lekking was described by Willis and Birch in 1982, but larvae raised in the laboratory prior to this study rarely engaged in lekking or corematal displays. Scientists were unsure of why this phenomenon didn’t occur in the lab, but laboratory raised larvae were usually reared on commercially available food which lacks PAs. The authors suggest that the PAs are used by the males to attract other moths by releasing the volatile PA hydroxydanaidal into the air. It is suggested in this study that this strategy of mate attraction came about by tapping into the PA affinity already programmed into the moths for feeding, which is further supported by the observation that E. acrea females release their pheromones a little <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening than the males. Similar uses of coremata to attract other moths have been observed in C. gangis and C. transiens along with altered development of coremata when larvae are reared without PAs. Boppre and Schneider observed adult males of these two species that were not permitted to eat PAs. Their coremata only developed into two, stalk-like projections with very few hairs arising from these stalks. Males that were given plants that produced PAs to feed upon, developed long coremata with four tubes, each longer than the males body, and each tube was highly pubescent. The authors suggest from this observation that there is a basic corematal phenotype, the two stalked coremata, and that PAs are required to form full coremata which is much larger and more elaborate than the basic corematal expression. These observations were further investigated by feeding larvae different amounts of PAs which had a direct correlation {{to the development of the}} coremata, which reached a maximum plateau around 2 mg of PAs ingested while in larval form. Similar to Jordan and others’ findings, the males raised on a diet devoid of PAs did not produce hydroxydanaidal.|$|E
40|$|We {{spent the}} last four lectures {{focusing}} how to efficiently compute the group operation for an elliptic curve E over a finite field Fq.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I propose {{to do the}} following: I will discuss the notions of {{intentionality}} and self-understanding of Dasein as developed in Heidegger's Basic Problems of Phenomenology. In doing so, I will try to show the interrelation of Dasein's always being intentionally directed towards something and its self-interpretation. As we will see, the everyday world has, for Heidegger, a character of "equipmental contexture. " This means that Dasein returns to itself from out of things, equipment, tools, or - quite differently - the work of art. In a word, Dasein is mirrored back toward itself from the things made, from the products of techne. From this will follow the important distinction between authenticity and inauthenticity. There is {{a sense in which}} the following pairings could be discerned: tools or pieces of equipment link up with inauthenticity, while the work of art links up with authenticity. I will say more on the subject of tools a <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> essay. Both kinds of things are things insofar as they are entrenched in techne. The common root seems almost inexplicable {{in the light of the}} vast difference between tools and the artwork. Moreover, both Dasein and techne seem to have another equally enigmatic common root: that of temporality. Temporality is the essential bond between Dasein and the double sense of techne, which suggests the double-sidedness of temporality itself. It is precisely this doublesidedness that I would like to have as the backdrop to my discussion as a whole. Finally, I will turn to a few pages of Heidegger's Being and Time and Bernard Stiegler's book Technics and Time I in order to complicate this notion of the two senses of temporality, the owned and disowned, originary and everyday, and its relation to work and techne. The overarching question here will be: Can the distinction between authenticity and inauthenticity be sustained...|$|E

At {{the end of}} 2008 the translation of the documentaries on National Geographic Channel Bulgaria switches the subtitles with dubbing, and a little <b>bit</b> <b>later,</b> <b>in</b> December, all announces on the TV also sound <b>in</b> Bulgarian. <b>The</b> same was expected to happen with Jetix, but after the company of Walt Disney decides to rebrand it to Disney Channel, the full localization was not done since early 2009.|$|R

The orthogonal spatial hyperslices are these appear as horizontal half-planes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rindler chart and as half-planes through [...] <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cartesian chart (see the figure above). Setting [...] <b>in</b> <b>the</b> line element, we see that these have the ordinary Euclidean geometry, [...] Thus, <b>the</b> spatial coordinates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rindler chart have a very simple interpretation consistent with {{the claim that the}} Rindler {{observers are}} mutually stationary. We will return to this rigidity property of the Rindler observers a <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> this article.|$|R

[...] When asked why he wrote such a book, Littell invokes a photo he discovered in 1989 of Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, a female Soviet partisan hanged by <b>the</b> Nazis <b>in</b> 1941. He adds that a <b>bit</b> <b>later,</b> <b>in</b> 1992, he watched the movie Shoah by Claude Lanzmann, which left an impression on him, especially the discussion by Raul Hilberg about the bureaucratic aspect of genocide.|$|R
