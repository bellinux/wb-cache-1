Suits brought against the Standard Oil Company and the American Tobacco Company, initiated under Roosevelt, were decided {{in favor of the}} government by the Supreme Court in 1911. In June 1911, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives began hearings into United States Steel (U.S. Steel). That company had been expanded under Roosevelt, who had supported its acquisition of the Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company as a means of preventing the deepening of the Panic of 1907, a decision the former president defended when testifying at the hearings. Taft, as Secretary of War, had praised the acquisitions. Historian Louis L. Gould suggested that Roosevelt was likely deceived into believing that U.S. Steel did not want to purchase the Tennessee company, but it was in fact a bargain. For Roosevelt, questioning the matter went to his personal honesty.|$|E

2500|$|In The Theory of Business Enterprise, {{which was}} {{published}} in 1904 during the height of American concern with the growth of <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> and trusts, Veblen employed his evolutionary analysis to explain these new forms. He saw them {{as a consequence of the}} growth of industrial processes in a context of small business firms that had evolved earlier to organize craft production. The new industrial processes impelled integration and provided lucrative opportunities for those who managed it. What resulted was, as Veblen saw it, a conflict between businessmen and engineers, with businessmen representing the older order and engineers as the innovators of new ways of doing things. In combination with the tendencies described in The Theory of the Leisure Class, this conflict resulted in waste and [...] "predation" [...] that served to enhance the social status of those who could benefit from predatory claims to goods and services.|$|E

In the process of valuation each company has three components that {{must be taken into account}} for an efficient valuation (assets, earning power and firm uniqueness). The process of analyzing <b>business</b> <b>combination</b> could be divided in three interdependent analyses: (1) An analyst must start by applying traditional capital budgeting analyses; (2) followed by identifying various flexibility options; and finally, (3) an analyst must determinate the present value of other strategic options along with the overall certainty of exercising them, together with the added certainty value of these options on traditional present value of <b>business</b> <b>combination.</b> Traditional capital budgeting analyses of <b>business</b> <b>combination</b> is based on net present value techniques.

50|$|As {{a result}} of the voting and {{conversion}} rights held by SPAC shareholders, only well-received transactions are typically approved by the shareholders. When a deal is proposed, a shareholder has three options. The shareholder can approve the transaction by voting in favor of it, elect to sell their shares in the open market, or vote against the transaction and redeem their shares for a pro-rata share of the trust account. (This is significantly different from the blind pool - blank check companies of the 1980s, which were a form of limited partnership that did not specify what investment opportunities the company plans to pursue.) The assets of the trust are only released if a <b>business</b> <b>combination</b> is approved by the voting shareholders, or a <b>business</b> <b>combination</b> is not consummated within 24 months of the initial offering. This guarantees a minimum liquidation value per share in the event that a <b>business</b> <b>combination</b> is not effected.|$|R
