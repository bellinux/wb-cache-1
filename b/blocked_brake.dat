50|$|After {{leaving the}} station, the 28 {{passenger}} train makes a wide “U” {{turn to the}} lift {{at the back of}} the ride. Rides ascend the 98.91 foot chain lift hill. Once at the top of the lift, riders drop towards the right reaching speeds of 50.20 MPH at the bottom of the drop. Upon exiting the drop, the train navigates a large vertical loop that runs parallel to the lift. After the lift, riders experience a 121° overbanked left turn that leads into a zero-g roll. After the zero-g roll, riders make another left turn up into the first <b>block</b> <b>brake.</b> After exiting the <b>block</b> <b>brake,</b> riders make another left hand turn and navigate through two back-to-back corkscrews then make a right turn up into the second <b>block</b> <b>brake.</b> After the second <b>block</b> <b>brake,</b> riders experience a tight right hand downward helix and a small hill before hitting the final brake run and returning to the station.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{comparison}} of the frictional characteristics of three different samples of <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> materials. Two commercial <b>brake</b> <b>blocks</b> (composite and grey iron/metallic) and a non-commercial composite <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> were extracted to form pins (specimens), and then their frictional properties were evaluated using a pin-on-disc apparatus. The non-commercial composite <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> that was investigated in this work was developed as a substitute for the grey iron <b>brake</b> <b>block.</b> The results revealed that the composite <b>brake</b> <b>blocks</b> had a higher wear resistance and were more stable in terms of their coefficient of friction at various contact pressures and sliding speeds compared to the grey iron <b>brake</b> <b>block.</b> The non-commercial composite <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> that was developed in this research had a coefficient of friction that was close to that of the grey iron <b>brake</b> <b>block,</b> and hence, it can be considered as a substitute for the grey iron <b>brake</b> <b>block...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Block</b> <b>brakes</b> are {{sections}} of brakes located on any roller coaster wherever {{more than one}} train is intended to run. They act as virtual barriers between the trains running on the roller coaster, preventing collisions should one train stop along the course for any reason. Because of this, <b>block</b> <b>brakes</b> must be capable of completely stopping the train (should a vehicle preceding the block stop) and starting a train (after it has been stopped). <b>Block</b> <b>brake</b> sections usually start the train again either by using a slight downward slope to let gravity take its course, or by using drive tires to push the train out of the <b>block.</b> Like trim <b>brakes,</b> <b>block</b> <b>brakes</b> {{can also be used}} to control the speed of the train. These are usually known as mid-course brake runs. An example of a mid-course brake run is on Titan at Six Flags Over Texas, which consists of such a brake run (which slows the train down drastically, almost to the point of stopping) due to the severe G-forces in its downward 540-degree helix following the brake run. Mid-course brake runs give more time for another train to be loaded. Often times, mid-course brake runs give so much time that another train can be fitted onto the track without the worry of bumping.|$|R
5|$|Green Lantern Coaster {{begins with}} a u-turn out of the station. It ascends a chain lift hill before going down a small dip and into an s-bend {{followed}} by a u-turn. After a slight ascent, the car enters a 120.5° drop – the steepest in the southern hemisphere. The track then returns to approximately two thirds of its original height before entering {{the first set of}} <b>block</b> <b>brakes.</b> These brakes lead into a left turn with reverse or outward banking. It then drops under the <b>block</b> <b>brakes</b> and into the first inversion – a Dive Loop. The inversion begins with half of an inline twist which transitions into half of a vertical loop. Upon exiting the inversion the track inclines into a second set of <b>block</b> <b>brakes.</b> The train then goes around a right u-turn and into the second inversion – a downwards inline twist. This leads into a cutback-style turnaround before entering the final brake run and returning to the station.|$|R

40|$|Surface {{roughness}} on 150 railway {{wheels and}} on the rails of 30 sites in the Netherlands have been measured. <b>Block</b> <b>braked</b> wheels were found to show higher roughnesses than the rail at any site. The smoothest rail is 8 dB smoother than the smoothest wheel. It was concluded that in reducing railway rolling noise NS must start {{to find ways to}} lower wheel roughness. Only after <b>block</b> <b>brakes</b> have been either removed or optimized will the rail require any attention. An exception to this rule is rail corrugation, which was found to occur locally. A good correlation was found between wheel and rail roughness levels and pass-by sound levels.

50|$|In 2004, {{before being}} {{assembled}} for the Düsseldorf fair, Eurostar’s zero-g roll, the left turn {{up into the}} first <b>block</b> <b>brake</b> after the zero-g roll and the left hand turn after the first <b>block</b> <b>brake,</b> were replaced. The doweled joints in the vertical loop had holes drilled into them to reduce noise and oscillation. Modification of the track connections was also done. The lift had a cover installed that would slide over the saw-tooth profile of the anti-rollbacks, making the surface smooth and eliminating noise created as the anti-rollbacks jumped between teeth. The change in the safety system required a control system to ensure rides safety. The train's speed is controlled, and any variance in the speed causes the cover to be pulled aside to expose the saw-tooth, causing the anti-rollbacks to engage. Should the system fail, springs would push the cover aside to ensure the anti-rollbacks would engage in case an emergency would arise.|$|R

40|$|<b>Block</b> <b>braking</b> is a {{commonly}} used braking system for freight wagons {{and other types}} of railway vehicles. One or several <b>brake</b> <b>blocks</b> are pressed against the tread (running surface) of the wheel, which is also in rolling contact with the rail. The kinetic energy of the running train is then transformed into heat, which is partitioned between block(s) and wheel and is conducted from block to block holder and from wheel to rail and also dissipated into the surroundings by convection and radiation. During the last decade, one aspect of <b>block</b> <b>braking</b> has become an environmental issue: the high rolling noise levels generated by trains with <b>block</b> <b>braked</b> wheels. A roughness (corrugation, waviness) develops on the wheel tread during the sliding contact between block and wheel, and this tread roughness (out-of-roundness) induces vibrations and noise when the train rolls. The roughness level strongly depends on the properties of the <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> material. Here cast iron blocks generate higher roughness levels than do composite and sinter blocks. In Europe, cast iron is presently the most commonly used <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> material on freight wagons, but composite and sinter materials are now gradually being introduced. In {{the first part of the}} present thesis, the thermomechanical interaction between <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> and wheel tread is studied to search for the mechanisms behind the growth of wheel roughness. The evolution of hot spots, i e areas on the wheel tread with significantly higher temperature than the rest of the tread, is believed to be a key phenomenon that can explain the differences between the different block materials. Results from full-scale tread braking experiments with forged wheels in an inertia dynamometer are reported. A numerical model for studying the thermoelastic contact between <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> and wheel tread demonstrates the principal phenomena. Also, results from field measurements of wheel roughness are presented. The tendency of cast iron <b>brake</b> <b>blocks</b> to generate high roughness levels on wheel treads has propelled a general shift away from cast iron to other materials which do not give disturbing roughness levels. However, this change of block material will affect the heat partitioning between wheel and block. Excessive heating of the wheel may cause damage and may result in problems with axial deflection of the wheel rim (change of wheelset gauge). High tensile stresses in the wheel rim after its cooling down can lead to initiation and growth of transverse cracks in the wheel rim. In the second part of the present thesis, a thermal model of railway tread braking is developed for use in routine calculations of wheel and block temperatures, including the cooling influence from the rail. Brake rig tests have been performed for drag braking at constant <b>brake</b> power for <b>blocks</b> made of cast iron and sinter and composite materials. Results on the influence of <b>block</b> configuration, <b>brake</b> power and brake speed on wheel and block temperatures are reported. Rolling contact heat transfer from wheel to rail is studied in the brake rig using a so-called rail-wheel in contact with the braked wheel, along with results from field tests. The model has been calibrated by using data from the experiments and can be employed to calculate temperatures and the heat partitioning between block, wheel and rail. The rail chill is found to have a considerable influence on the wheel temperature for long brake cycles. The present model can be used to efficiently design tread braking systems for both freight and passenger trains. It can handle stop braking, drag braking at constant brake power, and also intermediate periods of cooling. The temperature history during a full train route can thus be calculated...|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} disc brakes, which {{in comparison to}} traditional <b>block</b> <b>brakes</b> are more often used in rail vehicles. Because of numerous advantages in comparison to a traditional air <b>block</b> <b>brake,</b> disc brakes, {{are more and more}} often utilized in passenger carriages and other railway vehicles. Stable and constant – in the whole speed range – coefficient of friction µ, with the value: µ = 0. 35 is a basic advantage of disc brake systems [7]. Attempt to increase train speed, triggers application of greater braking power i. e. braking systems rapidly absorbing and dispersing stored heat energy. For stimulation of cooling processes of friction set (brake disc and friction pad), discs with ventilation canals shaped by various vanes, are used. Thanks to such solution discs take off about 40 % [4] of heat generated during braking. However, natural ventilation causes losses of energy for rotation of the disc during ride with switched off brakes, which is especially important for trains with little frequency of brakings and in cases when the profile of the track does not stimulate long-lasting braking. This article presents selected issues of operational use of rail disc brake such us total resistance generated by brake disc divided into resistance of disc inertia as mass in rotational motion and resistance generated by disc’s ventilator, and influence of blocked ventilation canals on braking process...|$|R
