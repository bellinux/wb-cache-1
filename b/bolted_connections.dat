40|$|Abstract—Bolt {{connection}} {{is one of}} the common connection methods in diesel engine. The {{purpose of this study is}} to verify the difference of considering the <b>bolt</b> <b>connection</b> or not in the shock response calculation. The methods applying in the study as following: first design the comparison test of welding <b>connection</b> and <b>bolt</b> connection; establish the diesel engine’s fasten component model of considering <b>bolt</b> <b>connection</b> and model without considering bolt connection; then calculate the shock response of the two kinds of model by DDAM method; and finally coupling the shock response in three direction. The above tests reach the result that: the natural frequency of model without considering <b>bolt</b> <b>connection</b> is higher than that of the model considering bolt connection; the rigid connection area will easily produce stress concentration; and the stress concentration can be effectively reduced by considering <b>bolt</b> <b>connection.</b> Therefore, the study suggest that <b>bolt</b> <b>connection</b> should be considered in the study of shock response calculation of diesel engine frequency domain.

40|$|Abstract: Connections are key {{elements}} and the weak points for timber structures. The {{most commonly used}} <b>bolted</b> timber <b>connections</b> with slotted in steel plate have low lateral stiffness in post-and-beam construction. This paper introduces the prestressed-tube <b>bolted</b> <b>connection</b> to alleviate this problem. To evaluate its lateral resisting performance, the failure mode, strength, lateral stiffness, ductility, hysteresis curve and equivalent viscous damping ratio of the ordinary and improved connections, {{as determined by the}} monotonic and reversed cyclic loading test, are compared. The results demonstrate that the lateral stiffness of the prestressed-tube <b>bolted</b> <b>connection</b> has been significantly improved, especially for initial stiffness. It is believed that the semi-rigid prestressed-tube <b>bolted</b> <b>connection,</b> as an alternative to current bolted solutions, may provide reasonable lateral stiffness and has good potential for use in post-and-beam timber construction...|$|R

The experimental study was performed using single-lap shear testing of a concentrically loaded <b>bolt</b> <b>connection</b> fabricated from G 550 cold-formed steel.

40|$|This paper aims {{to develop}} a new method for {{strengthening}} reinforced concrete (RC) coupling beams. Experiments were conducted to test three full-scale RC coupling beams, of which two were strengthened by bolted external steel plates on the side faces of the beams and the other one acted as a control specimen without strengthening. The improvements to strength, deformation and energy dissipation of the external plate strengthened RC coupling beams were observed from the experimental results. Nonlinear finite element analysis was carried out to model the strengthened and non-strengthened coupling beams. The material properties used for concrete and reinforcement in the numerical analysis were validated by the laboratory tests. As the experimental study showed that there was a small slip between the <b>bolted</b> <b>connection</b> and the concrete wall pier, a bilinear model was used to simulate the load-slip behaviour of the <b>bolt</b> <b>connections.</b> The model was calibrated by the experimental results from the plate strengthened coupling beams. A numerical parametric study found that the small slip (> 3 mm) between the <b>bolt</b> <b>connection</b> and the concrete wall could significantly affect the load-carrying capacity of the <b>bolt</b> <b>connections</b> as well as the structural performance of the strengthened coupling beams.

Experiments were carried out previously with steel bolts which connect the UHF blocks to the GFRP beam. Because of the corrosion of the steel bolts, the life span of the composite girder is reduced.
