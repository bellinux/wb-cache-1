In the Experimental Center of the National University of Colombia-Palmira (CEUNP) a experiment was realized to evaluate {{the effect of the}} <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilization,</b> using two sources (gallinaza and urea) at two levels (50 and 100 kg/ha of nitrogen) and two cutting frequencies (each two and four months). In the experimental area 15 plots were planted, in a randomized Complete Blocks design random (RCBD) with five treatments and three repetitions to measure the following variables: production of fresh matter, content of dry matter, nutrients extraction and content of essential oils. The analysis of variance used the statistical program SAS. The maximum yield of biomass and essential was obtained oils combining the fertilization with 100 kg/ha of nitrogen as urea and the cutting frequency every of two months. The levels of nutrients extraction of Lippia alba varied between 79. 7 and 128. 5 kg/ha of nitrogen, 24. 5 and 30. 5 kg/ha of phosphorus, 114. 6 and 138. 8 Kg/ha of potassium and between 100 y 150 kg/ha of Calcium.

40|$|In 2001 – 2004 an {{influence}} of gradually increased portions of nitrogen (100 – 130 – 160 kg/N. ha– 1) applied on the wheat variety Ebi {{in combination with}} the modified fungicidal protection in the yield and the selected quality grain parameters were observed within the small-plot field trials. Nitrogenous fertilizers according to the amount of nitrogen contained were applied in 2 – 4 terms during vegetation in regeneration (55 kg/N. ha– 1), 1 st production (45 kg/N. ha– 1), 2 nd production (30 kg/N. ha– 1) and qualitative portion (30 kg/N. ha– 1). The fungicidal protection was based on the equal treatment in the phase of BBCH 37 and with regard to the varieties different treatment in the phase of BBCH 55. The dependence on the year was proved at all observed parameters. Higher intensity of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilization</b> had no decisive impact on the yields. From {{the point of view of}} increased yields, the second production <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilization</b> had the strongest impact; it increased the grain yields by 0. 084 – 0. 461  t. /ha– 1. Higher intensity of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilization</b> positively influenced the baker’s grain quality. The increased portions of nitrogen decisively increased the volume of N-substances in all trial years. The second production <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilization</b> increased the N-substances volume from 0. 1 to 0. 8 %. Qualitative additional fertilization increased their volume from 0. 26 to 1. 38 %. Higher N portions increased sedimentation in most cases. The falling number was not considerably influenced. The mechanical grain qualities (volume weight, number full grains, and GTW) were relatively less influenced than the baker’s quality by the <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilization.</b> The application of fungicides positively influenced not only the yields but also mechanical qualities of the grain, i. e. volume weight, thousand grains weight and portion of Full grains. On the contrary the baker’s quality was not decisively influenced. It was proved that the decisive fungicidal treatment is the one applied in the period of coming to ear (BBCH 55). Single fungicidal treatment in the early period of the flag leaves (BBCH 37) increased the yields only by 6 % and the grain quality was not decisively influenced. Double treatment then increased the yields by 18. 15 % in average. The highest increases were reached at fungicidal varieties fertilized with the nitrogen portion (19. 55 %), the lowest after application of the N portion on the level of 100 kg/ha– 1. Here the grain yields were also in average 16. 77 % higher than the yields of the untreated varieties. The highest grain yields after the application of fungicide was reached in 2003 (26. 16 %) and the lowest in 2001 (14. 16 %). The differences in the yields at the varieties with the full fungicidal protection and different spectrum of fungicides used were not statistically evident in the trial duration. The increase in the yields contrary to untreated variety and the variety with the limited fungicidal protection (application of fungicides only in BBCH 37) was statistically evident in most cases. The least effective was the impact of the fungicide Caramba in the portion of 1 l/ha– 1. On the contrary, the varieties containing the fungicides with the agent from the group of strobilurins including Charisma containing the agent of famoxate proved very good results. GTW was most influenced by the fungicidal protection. The relative increase of GTW was between 7. 53 – 11. 48 %. This value was positively influenced by the application of Juwel followed by Amistar in full as well as reduced portion combined with azol contained in Caramba. With regard to the fact that these trends were reached in all years of the trial, we can say that strobilurins have the positive impact on the value of this parameter. In average of the trial duration as well as in particular years the positive impact of the double fungicidal treatment on the number of full grains (2. 76 – 3. 37 % increase) was proved. On the contrary, the fungicidal protection decreased the value of the falling number by 1. 52 – 10. 23 %...|$|R

25|$|The {{presence}} of certain versions of wheat genes has been important for crop yields. Apart from mutant versions of genes selected in antiquity during domestication, {{there has been}} more recent deliberate selection of alleles that affect growth characteristics. Genes for the 'dwarfing' trait, first used by Japanese wheat breeders to produce short-stalked wheat, have had a huge effect on wheat yields worldwide, and were major factors {{in the success of}} the Green Revolution in Mexico and Asia, an initiative led by Norman Borlaug. Dwarfing genes enable the carbon that is fixed in the plant during photosynthesis to be diverted towards seed production, and they also help prevent the problem of lodging. 'Lodging' occurs when an ear stalk falls over in the wind and rots on the ground, and heavy <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilization</b> of wheat makes the grass grow taller and become more susceptible to this problem. By 1997, 81% of the developing world's wheat area was planted to semi-dwarf wheats, giving both increased yields and better response to nitrogenous fertilizer.|$|R
40|$|Yield {{responses}} of bean are often {{limited by the}} nitrogen deficiency, being the most common limiting factor {{for the growth of}} the plants. Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is often considered as a poor N 2 -fixing legume. Thus, it is often cultivated with a complement of mineral <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilization</b> to correct this deficiency and to raise the yields. The symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) provides an ecologically acceptable alternative to the high applications of nitrogenous fertilizers, especially in Europe, and an economic alternative to the limited access to these fertilizers in the developing countries. The objectives of the work are i) to study the genotypic diversity represented by local populations of bean, ii) to identify those populations which can be useful to improve SNF potential as well as iii) to determine the degree of genetic diversity of the native populations of rhizobia that nodulate P. vulgaris in the soils of Galicia and their potential to fix N 2 with local populations of bean.

The fertilizer used was applied in two forms : supergranules and prills placed at 10 cm in the soil {{at the time of}} transplanting or 21 days after transplanting. This study confirms thatr supergranules work better than urea prills. This bad performance of prilled urea is due to the important initial losses having their effect increased by a low nitrogen availability just after transplanting and to a subsequent shortage resulting in plant nitrogen remobilization. When urea supergranules are placed in the soil at transplanting temporarily high actual coefficients of recovery can be attained by a good adaptation of roots to NH 4 -NH 3 concentration gradient. Nevertheless, a nitrogen shortage at the end of plant growth may limit the effects of fertilizer placement. The maximum efficiency of urea supergranules applied 21 days after transplanting is reduced but the more durable availability of fertilizer nitrogen leads to quite similar results at harvest time for the two fertilizer placement dates...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of new nitrogen fertilizers is necessary to optimize crop production whilst improving the environmental aspects arising {{from the use of}} <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilization</b> as a cultural practice. The use of urease inhibitors aims to improve the efficiency of urea as a nitrogen fertilizer by preventing its loss from the soil as ammonia. However, although the action of urease inhibitors is aimed at the urease activity in soil, their availability for the plant may affect its urease activity. The aim of this work was therefore to evaluate the effect of two urease inhibitors, namely acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) and N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT), on the germination of pea and spinach seeds. The results obtained show that urease inhibitors do not affect the germination process to any significant degree, with the only process affected being imbibition in spinach, thus also suggesting different urease activities for both plants. Our findings therefore suggest an activity other than the previously reported urolytic activity for urease in spinach. Furthermore, of the two inhibitors tested, NBPT was found to be the most effective at inhibiting urease activity, especially in pea seedlings. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

40|$|The {{effect of}} nitrogenous-fertilization on the {{population}} dynamics and natural control of rice leaffolders was studied in an irrigated rice area in the Philippines. Nitrogen was applied at three levels (0, 75 and 150 kg N ha- 1), {{and its impact on}} crop growth and yield, arthropod abundance, and rates of leaffolder parasitism and survival was assessed with weekly samples. Rice plants were taller and had a higher leaf nitrogen content with increasing levels of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilization,</b> but grain yield was highest at the medium nitrogen level. Herbivores, predators, and parasitoids increased in abundance with nitrogenous-fertilization level. The average density of rice leaffolder larvae at the highest nitrogen level was eight times the density at zero nitrogen level, and the peak percentage injured leaves increased from 5 to 35 &Eth;The strong increase in larval density was due to the positive effect of nitrogenous-fertilization on egg recruitment and survival of medium-sized larvae. The percentage parasitism of eggs and larvae was not affected by nitrogenous-fertilization. The increase in survival of medium-sized larvae with nitrogen levels was associated with lower predator to leaffolder ratios. The strong effect of nitrogenous-fertilization in the present small-scale experiment was attributed mainly to allowing the moths an oviposition choice between plots with different application levels of nitrogen. Therefore it is hypothesized that the effect of increasing nitrogenous-fertilization level on leaffolder larval densities will be less pronounced when implemented over a large area...|$|R

Gradients of added nitrogen were prepared by adding nitrogen to 1 m x 1 m plots at rates of 0 - 36 g/m(2) /yr. These different levels of nitrogen addition were applied to four sites representing a vegetation development chronosequence: bare ground (BG), a Rhynchospora alba sedgeland (RA), a Moliniopsis japonica grassland (MJ) and the original Sphagnum bog (SS). Vegetation was monitored in each plot for three years, and the groundwater level and nitrogen concentration in peat-pore water were monitored in each plot. The nitrogen concentration in peat-pore water increased with increasing nitrogen addition on BG, but was constantly low at the vegetated sites, suggesting the occurrence of nutrient uptake by plants. Species richness decreased {{as a result of}} nitrogen addition at the SS site, where plant cover was high. The aboveground biomass of the two common grasses M. japonica and Phragmites communis was not influenced by nitrogen addition in the post-mined peatland. Grasses and sedges, which produce large underground organs, showed increased biomass as a result of nitrogen addition in the SS plot whereas Sphagnum declined. Additionally, forbs declined in the SS plot with increasing nitrogen, most likely due to competition with the increased populations of grasses.

The results obtained were as follows: 1) Seeding in August showed {{the highest number of}} stems in the next spring (Apr. 25) per area due to the highest overwintering rate of stems (the number of stems on Feb. 25 as a percentage of that on Nov. 25), and the highest rate of {{increase in the number of}} stems in spring (the number of stems on Apr. 25 as a percentage of that on Feb. 25). Because of the serious damage to the seedlings by low temperature, the number of stems in spring with October seeding was significantly low compared to the other seeding times, though its number of seedlings at two months after seeding showed the highest value. 2) The dressing of 5 kgN / 10 a of slow-release fertilizer was effective for establishing more seedlings at two months after seeding and more stems in spring. All of the seedlings in October seeding under the treatments of fast-release fertilizer and 10 kgN slow-release fertilizer applications died off in winter. 3) Post-sowing trimming had little effect on the number of stems in the next spring.

The results obtained were as follows: 1) Owing to the significantly higher number of seedlings at two months after seeding and the higher rate of {{increase in the number}} of stems in spring (the percentage of the number of stems on Apr. 25 to that on Feb. 25), over-seeding on Oct. 1 st showed the significantly higher number of stems in the next spring (April 25) comparing with the other seeding times, although overwintering rate of stems (the percentage of the number of stems on Feb. 25 to that on Nov. 30) was low 2) With the low rate of application (5 kgN/ 10 a) of slow-release fertilizer, the increasing effects on the number of seedlings, the overwintering rate of stems and the tillering in spring resulted the highest number of stems in the next spring in October seeding. 3) Post-sowing trimming significantly increased the relative light intensity in the upper layer of seedlings, which increased the tillering in spring and the number of stems in the next spring. These effects were significant in October seeding with twice trimming. The results suggested that seeding in October with the application of slow-release fertilizer of 5 kgN/ 10 a followed by twice post-sowing trimming was most effective for the establishment of orchardgrass drilled into tussock-formed orchardgrass sward. 本研究は荒廃オーチャードグラス草地に,条播機を利用し追播したオーチャードグラスの定着に関する基礎的資料をうることを目的とした. オーチャードグラスを移植した木箱における追播オーチャードグラスの定着個体数,茎の越冬率,翌春の分げつ増加率及び春の茎数に及ぼす播種時期(8 月 1 日, 9 月 1 日, 10 月 1 日,以下 1 日を省略),窒素施肥(速効性窒素 5 kg/ 10 a,緩効性窒素 5 kg/ 10 a及び同 10 kg/ 10 a,以下/ 10 aを省略) 及び播種後の刈払い回数(0 回, 1 回, 2 回) の影響並びにこれらの要因間の相互関係について検討した. 1) 播種時期の影響:播種後 2 カ月間の群落内相対照度は,播種時期の遅れに伴い有意に高くなることが認められた. 10 月播種における良好な光環境は,その定着個体数が 8 月及び 9 月播種の 5. 3 倍以上と有意に高い値を示した一因と考えられる. また, 10 月播種の茎の越冬率は低くなる傾向を示したが,透過光量の増加により翌春の分げつ増加率は 8 月播種より高い値となった. その結果,春の茎数は 8 月播種の 3. 71 倍と有意に高い値となることが認められた. 2) 施肥の影響:施肥が定着個体数,茎の越冬率及び翌春の茎数に及ぼす影響について,播種時期との間に有意な交互作用(p< 0. 05) のあることが認められた. 8 月及び 9 月播種の場合,緩効性窒素の施用は速効性窒素施肥に比べ春の分げつ増加率を高める効果をもつことが示唆された. さらに 9 月播種では,緩効性窒素の施用により,越冬率も向上することが認められ,特に 10 kg施用では冬季における分げつ増加もみられ,その結果,春の茎数は速効性窒素 5 kg施用の 4. 4 倍以上と高い値を示した. また, 10 月播種では,緩効性窒素 5 kg施肥により,定着個体数及び茎の越冬率が有意に高い値を示し,その結果,春の茎数は緩効性窒素 10 kg施肥の 5. 3 倍と顕著に高い値となることが認められた. 3) 刈払いの影響:播種後の刈払い回数の増加に伴い群落内の播種後 2 カ月間及び翌春の相対照度が高くなり,追播幼植物の光環境が改善され,春の分げつ増加率が有意に高まることが認められた. 8 月播種の場合には 2 回の刈払いが 9 月及び 10 月播種では 1 回以上の刈払いが春の分げつ増加率を高める方策として有効なことが示された. 以上の結果,オーチャードグラス草地における追播同草種の春の茎数増加に有効な最適管理条件は,定着個体数が顕著に多く得られた 10 月の播種,定着個体数及び茎の越冬率に顕著に高い値が示された緩効性窒素 5 kgの施肥,さらに,翌春の分げつ増加率を高めるための播種後 2 回の刈払い管理であることが認められた. また,他の播種期については 8 月播種では 2 回の刈払い, 9 月播種では緩効性窒素 10 kg/ 10 a施用と 1 回の刈払いが春の茎数増加に有効であることが認められた. なお,刈払いの困難な場合には, 10 月遅播きを行うことにより春の茎数は他の播種時期のいずれの刈払い処理区より高い値となる傾向が認められた...|$|R
40|$|Durante os anos de 1957 a 1960, instalaram-se cêrca de 400 experiências de adubação para algodoeiro, nas principais zonas de exploração dessa malvácea no Estado de São Paulo. Dessas experiêncis, por diversas causas, só foram aproveitadas 216 para os estudos de fertilidade. Os resultados indicaram maior reação para o fósforo, pequena para o nitrogênio e raramente para o potássio. Estudando-se os teores de fósforo solúvel em H 2 SO 4 0, 05 N, foi possível diferenciar dois tipos de reação, um para solos arenosos e outros para argilosos, e estabelecer os respectivos níveis de fertilidade. Foram estabelecidos níveis, apenas preliminares, de reação ao nitrogênio, em virtude do pequeno número de experimentos com resposta significativa a esse elemento. Dado o pequeno número de experiências com reação ao potássio, nenhuma indicação se conseguiu sôbre os níveis de fertilidade para êsse elemento. Verificou-se relação entre o pH do solo e a reação à adubação fosfatada, diminuindo a ação desta com a elevação do pH. As experiências encontradas na literatura, abrangendo os mesmos solos e utilizando os mesmos extratores, permitiram confirmar os níveis de fertilidade preconizados para as condições do Estado de São Paulo. During {{the years}} of 1957 through 1960. about 400 {{experiments}} for cotton fertilizing were installed in the main districts of exploitation of this malvacea. For some reason or another, only 216 out of these experiments {{were used for the}} studies about fertility. The results obtained from the fertilization indicate that the major reaction is for the element phosphorus, in a small scale for the nitrogen and, for potassium, in less than 5 % of the whole of the experiments. When studying the contents of phosphorus soluble in H 2 SO 4 0. 05 N, it was possible to differentiate two types of rection: one for sandy soils and the other for the clay soils, thus establishing the respective levels of fertility. Another method investigated was that of the oxalic acid + potassium oxalate 1 N as extractor of phosphorus, which did not show adequate to foresee the requirements of phosphorous fertilization. The levels of nitrogen established through this experimentation should be considered as a preliminary attempt, on account of the small number of trials with reaction to <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilization.</b> Due to the small number of trials with reaction to potassium, no indications were possible to be obtained for this element. It was also found that there is a relation between the pH of the soil and the reaction to phosphorous fertilization, lessening its action with the raising of the pH. The experiments as located in the literature, referring to the same soils and utilizing the same extractors, allowed the confirmation of the divulgated fertility levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} general remarks on the {{establishment}} of the direct seed-drilling which may recover wasted pastures in the highland area of Kyushu. The pasture management from the viewpoint of its maintenance and utilization is indispensable to the sustainable production of livestock from pastures. In pastures in the highland area of Kyushu which belongs to the Asian monsoon zone, the persistence of temperate pastures is limited to short years on account of unfavorable conditions such as high temperature and large rainfall in summer and the difficulty in pasture management. The author investigated the vegetation changes {{that took place in the}} pasture management related to weather, grazing and fertilization factors. This resulted, however, in wasted pastures owing to overgrazing and fertilizing in summer, where bare grounds appeared and were occupied by various weeds and there was a reduction of main valuable grass species. Orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) is considered a main grass in the highland area of Kyushu. Then, to recover vegetation simply in wasted pastures, I made attempts at overseeding and weed control which were considered of importance to the pasture management. Moreover, as the overseeding was not easy, some basic experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of various factors on the establishment of seed drilled into pasture sods. First, to promote the germination rate of seeds, the following two experiments were conducted. (1) Effects of soaking or air-drying pretreatment and sprinkling the seed bed on the early germination of orchardgrass. It was suggested that seed soaking or air-drying pretreatment promoted the early germination rate of the seed in case of low-moisture soil. (2) Effects of three water holding materials (vermiculite, Sphagnum, synthetic resim) added to the surface of low-moisture volcanic ash soil on the soil water cpntent and early germination of orchardgrass. It was suggested that adding water holding materials to the surface of low-moisture volcanic ash soil promoted the germination rate of the seed directly drilled into deteriorated pasture sods by improving soil water condition. Second, to promote {{the establishment of the}} seedlings of orchardgrass oversown into the bare ground, orchardgrass sod or Kentucky bluegrass sod, effects of seeding time (Aug. 1, Sep. 1, Oct. 1), <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilization</b> (5 kgN/ 10 a of fast-release fertilizer, 5 kgN/ 10 a or 10 kgN/ 10 a of slow-release fertilizer) and post-sowing trimming frequency (none, once, twice) were conducted. It was suggested that (1) seeding time should be chosen according to the vegetation condition of pastures, (2) the form and amount of fertilizer applied were dependent on the seeding time, and (3) trimming the existent sward around orchardgrass seedlings should be done to give favorable light condition. Third, effects of time and frequency of cutting on stem density and plant length of orchardgrass which had been drilled in the previous year into the bare ground, orchardgrass sod and Kentucky bluegrass sod. It was suggested that cutting at the early heading stage in the next spring was important to increase stem density and plant length. Results of the present study suggested that overseeding in October with the application of slow-release fertilizer at 5 kgN/ 10 a level followed by twice post-sowing trimming and cutting the grass at early heading stage in the next spring were most effective for the establishment of orchardgrass drilled into tussock-formed orchardgrass sward...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogenous {{compounds}} {{are considered}} {{very important in}} beer playing {{a key role in}} determining the quality and stability of the finished product. They include amino acids, peptides, polypeptides, proteins, nucleic acids and their degradation products. These compounds affect fl avor, foam stability, haze formation, color, yeast nutrition and <b>biological</b> stability. The <b>nitrogenous</b> compounds in beer are derived mainly from barley malt and its adjuncts. Moreover the brewing process may have an important role in determining complex profile of nitrogenous compounds present in the fi nal beer. The content of nitrogen compounds in barley depends on variety and on environmental condition in cultivation. During malting the storage proteins are degraded to amino acids and other peptides. These amino acids are important in wort to promote a good fermentation and the yeast budding. During fermentation amino acids are used in different ways by yeasts and may have many effects on the final quality of beer: in particular the amino nitrogen content infl uences the flavor profi le of beer. The amino acids present in final beer could influence negatively the stability of product promoting haze formation. Nitrogen compounds may also play an important role influencing the foam quality and stability...|$|R
40|$|Removal of {{nitrogenous}} compounds from {{precious metal}} refinery (PMR) wastewater {{is important in}} terms of avoiding eutrophication (environmental protection), metal recovery (increased overall process efficiency and value recovery) and reuse of treated water (maximum use of natural resources). Extreme pH conditions (4 to 13 depending on the wastewater stream), high chemical oxygen demand (> 10, 000 mg/I), numerous metals and high concentrations of those metals (> 20 mg/l of platinum group metals) in the wastewater are the main challenges for <b>biological</b> removal of <b>nitrogenous</b> compounds from PMR wastewater. Nitrogenous compounds such as NH₄⁺-N and N 0 ₃-N are strong metal ligands, which make it difficult to recover metals from the wastewater. Therefore, a bioprocess was developed for removal of nitrogenous compounds from carefully simulated PMR wastewater. A preliminary investigation of metal wastewater was carried out to determine its composition and physico-chemical properties, the ability to nitrify and denitrify under different pH conditions and denitrification with different carbon Source compounds and amounts. Even at pH 4, nitrification could be carried out. A suitable hydraulic retention time was found to be 72 hours. There {{was no significant difference between}} sodium acetate and sodium lactate as carbon sources for denitrification. Based on these results, a reactor comparison study was carried out using simulated PMR wastewater in three types of reactors: continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR), packed-bed reactor (PBR) and airlift suspension reactor (ALSR). These reactors were fed with 30 mg/l of Rh bound in an NH₄⁺ based compound (Claus salt: pentaaminechlororhodium (III) dichloride). Total nitrogen removal efficiencies of > 68 %, > 79 % and > 45 % were obtained in the CSTR, PBR and ALSR, respectively. Serially connected CSTR-PBR and PBR-CSTR reactor configurations were then studied to determine the best configuration for maximum removal of nitrogenous compounds from the wastewater. The PBR-CSTR configuration gave consistent biomass retention and automatic pH control in the CSTR. Ammonium removal efficiencies > 95 % were achieved in both reactors. As poor nitrate removal was observed a toxicity study was carried out using respirometry and the half saturation inhibition coefficients for Pt, Pd, Rh and Ru were found to be 15. 81, 25. 00, 33. 34 and 39. 25 mg/l, respectively. A mathematical model was developed to describe the nitrogen removal in PMR wastewater using activated sludge model number 1 (ASMl), two step nitrification and metal toxicity. An operational protocol was developed based on the literature review, experimental work and simulation results. The optimum reactor configuration under the set conditions (20 mg/I of Rh and 90 % and 95 %, respectively. Finally, a rudimentary microbial characterisation was carried out on subsamples from the CSTR and PBRsecondary. It was found that the CSTR biomass consisted of both rods and cocci while PBRsecondary consisted of rods only. Based on these experimental works, further research needs and recommendations were made for optimisation of the developed bioprocess for removal of nitrogenous compounds from PMR wastewater...|$|R
