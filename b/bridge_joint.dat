40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the research on}} the noise and vibration correlation of a <b>bridge</b> movement <b>joint.</b> The aim {{of this research is}} to assess the noise induced by the vibration of a <b>bridge</b> movement <b>joint</b> without lane closure during the operation period. There are two methods of developing the correlation between the tyre/joint noise and vibration: (i) Direct Sound and Vibration Measurement Method, (ii) Acoustic-Box-in-Vehicle Method. The first one is the measurements of the vibration change at a <b>bridge</b> movement <b>joint</b> and roadside noise change induced when a control vehicle is passing it (this one requires lane closure). The correlation between the vibration change and roadside noise change is plotted according the measurement data. The second one is the measurements of the structure-borne noise change in an acoustic box installed into the control vehicle and roadside noise change induced. Similarly, the correlation between the structure-borne noise change and roadside noise induced is plotted. It is found that the two correlations are linear and similar to each other, even though the roadside noise is nonlinearly increasing against the control vehicle speed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The Tay Bridge Stole was worn by Her Majesty and was exhibited at the [...] "Skill" [...] exhibition staged by the Institute of Directors, The Craft Centre of Great Britain and the Scottish Craft Centre in 1968.

50|$|The modern-day PATCO Speedline {{follows the}} route of several {{mainline}} railroad lines, some {{dating back to the}} 19th century. These railroads all terminated in Camden, where passengers could catch ferries across the Delaware River to Philadelphia. Early in the 20th century, the idea of a fixed Delaware River crossing connecting Camden and Philadelphia gained traction, and in 1919, the states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey formed the Delaware River <b>Bridge</b> <b>Joint</b> Commission to build a bridge between the two cities. The Delaware River Bridge (now Ben Franklin Bridge) was designed to accommodate rail as well as road traffic; when it opened on July 1, 1926, it had two outboard structures beside the main roadway for rail and space for two streetcar tracks (never installed) on the main road deck. Construction of the rail line did not actually begin until 1932, and the Bridge Line opened on June 7, 1936. Relatively short, it only had four stations: 8th Street and Franklin Square in Philadelphia (the latter currently closed) and City Hall and Broadway in Camden (connecting to the Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines at Broadway).|$|E
5000|$|In 1919, Pennsylvania and New Jersey legislatures {{approved}} {{the creation of}} the Delaware River <b>Bridge</b> <b>Joint</b> Commission. The first meeting was held on December 12, 1919, with commissioners from both Pennsylvania and New Jersey. On July 1, 1926, the first bridge opened before a crowd of over 25,000 people. It was named the [...] "Delaware River Bridge," [...] and following the ceremony, over 100,000 people participated in the inaugural walk. United States President Calvin Coolidge came the next day to dedicate the bridge. However, there was thought {{that there should be a}} regional governing body for a port authority, and also the construction of another bridge and a high-speed rail line. And so, on July 17, 1951 United States President Harry S. Truman signed a bill, which created the Delaware River Port Authority. In 1953, construction started on a new bridge to connect South Philadelphia and Gloucester City. In 1955, the existing bridge was renamed Benjamin Franklin Bridge while the name Walt Whitman Bridge was approved for the new bridge which would open in 1957. By 1966, two more bridges were approved; the Commodore Barry Bridge (opened February 1, 1974) and the Betsy Ross Bridge (opened April 30, 1976). In 1974 and 1990, the Ben Franklin Bridge and the Walt Whitman Bridge carried their one-billionth vehicle, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Composite (steel-concrete) ladder-decks {{represent}} one of {{the most}} common solutions in road bridges nowadays. In these structures the Serviceability Limit State (SLS) of vibrations is traditionally ignored or roughly addressed by means of simple static deflection-based approaches, inherently assuming that the vibrations are controlled by the fundamental longitudinal mode. This work demonstrates that a wide range of high-order vibrational modes, involving the transverse flexure of the slab between longitudinal girders, govern the accelerations recorded in the deck and inside the vehicles. In addition, a new methodology for analysing the Vehicle–Bridge Interaction is proposed, including the approaching platforms, the transition slabs, and the <b>bridge</b> <b>joints.</b> The results suggest that the riding comfort for vehicle users is specially affected by direct effects on the wheels, like the road roughness and possible construction misalignments at the <b>bridge</b> <b>joints,</b> as well as low-frequency vibrations coming from the deck in short or slender bridges. The filtering effects resulting from the average of the response in time and in space when calculating the root mean square acceleration are also explored, and new design parameters are provided. In addition, several structural features (such as the depth and spacing of the longitudinal and transverse steel beams, the thickness of the concrete slab, and the stiffness of the cantilever cross beams at the diaphragm sections) have been studied, and a set of new design criteria has been established. It has been demonstrated that the transverse flexibility of the deck (specially influenced by the support conditions and the slab thickness) is critically important for the users’ (pedestrians and vehicle passengers) comfort, as it controls the aforementioned high-order vibrational modes which govern the dynamic response...|$|R
