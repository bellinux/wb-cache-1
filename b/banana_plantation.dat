5|$|The train {{stopped at}} a station that had no town, and {{a short while later}} it passed the only <b>banana</b> <b>plantation</b> along the route that had its name written over the gate: Macondo. This word had {{attracted}} my attention ever since the first trips I had made with my grandfather, but I discovered only as an adult that I liked its poetic resonance. I never heard anyone say it and did not even ask myself what it meant...I happened to read in an encyclopedia that it is a tropical tree resembling the Ceiba.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys dimidiatus {{is known}} from three {{specimens}} {{collected in the}} lowlands of the South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region in southeastern Nicaragua. The first, an old male, was collected on November5, 1904, in a <b>banana</b> <b>plantation</b> with very moist red clay on the Río Escondido near El Rama. The second, a young adult male, was caught on July26, 1966, in dense cane on the south bank of the Río Mico at El Recreo, 15km (9mi) west from {{the location of the}} first specimen, along with three other rice rats (O.couesi, Melanomys caliginosus, and Oligoryzomys fulvescens), the cotton rat Sigmodon hirsutus, and the cottontail rabbit Sylvilagus brasiliensis. The third was caught at a stream near Bluefields. Reid suggested that the species is semiaquatic, spending some time in the water, like other Oryzomys.|$|E
5|$|In {{the town}} of Broome, the maximum wind gust {{recorded}} was 153km/h (95mph), recorded at the Broome aerodrome, as well as recording 163.8mm (6.45in) of rain for the 24hours up to 9 a.m. WST (0100 UTC) on 20 April. Vegetation in this area were badly damaged, particularly the African Mahogany trees which were either snapped off or uprooted. Parts of Cable Beach were severely eroded. An area {{which used to be}} covered with sand was completely covered by rocks. The eastern side of Roebuck Bay had evidence of severe erosion of the coastal terrain. At Broome's only <b>banana</b> <b>plantation,</b> almost all crops were completely lost, with 10 out of 18,000 plants left surviving. Fortunately, most buildings in {{the town of}} Broome remained unharmed, although power supplies were cut to many parts of Broome for several days.|$|E
50|$|Child labor on <b>banana</b> <b>plantations</b> {{has also}} {{historically}} been a heated labor issue Labor unions, UNICEF, {{and others have}} resisted the use of child labor as young as 8 on <b>banana</b> <b>plantations,</b> and have won concessions in some countries such as Ecuador, which instituted a minimum worker age of 15 years.

50|$|However, the government, like Coosemupar {{wants to}} sell the <b>banana</b> <b>plantations</b> and {{operations}} to a banana company. Consequently, in January 2012, President Martinelli and members of Coosemupar, signed an agreement that states that the government will: 1) Pay off Coosemupar’s 19.7 million dollar debt. Which means the 24 <b>banana</b> <b>plantations</b> will then revert to Government ownership. 2) Give relief and land to the plantation workers who still live on the plantations. 3) Sell the 24 <b>banana</b> <b>plantations</b> (fincas) to company(s) that will provide {{the greatest number of}} jobs.|$|R

25|$|Honner set {{out with}} Sergeant T. G. Pryor and three privates {{to see if}} he could find water in A Company's area around Koram. At around 15:00, they came across a <b>banana</b> <b>plantation,</b> and saw troops moving around in it. They assumed that they were from A Company, but when they {{approached}} they were fired on, and Honner and Pryor were both wounded. Pryor, wounded in the throat and chest, attempted to drag Honner, who was wounded in the thigh and could not move easily, but Honner ordered him to return to get help. Private W. H. G. remained to protect Honner; the other two privates accompanied Pryor.|$|E
25|$|Pryor reached D Company, whose commander, Captain G. O. O'Day, {{immediately}} set {{out with}} Lieutenant A. R. Avery's 16 Platoon. Avery found Honner, {{covered in blood}} and black ants. Honner refused {{to be carried out}} under fire, as this might endanger the stretcher bearers. Instead, he used Avery's radio to arrange an attack on the <b>banana</b> <b>plantation</b> by A, C and D Companies, which was delivered at 18:00. While the fighting was going on, the stretcher bearers tended to Honner's wounds, and carried him back. Seven Australians were wounded in the action, including Honner, who was flown out from Gusap the next day; 26 Japanese soldiers were killed, and one, wounded, was taken prisoner. Water was found in the A Company area, although some was also sent forward by jeep. The wounded, including Honner, were taken to the dressing station at Kaigulan II by jeep. The last one did not arrive until after midnight.|$|E
25|$|Born at Devon, Jamaica, {{where he}} was taught cricket by {{the manager of a}} <b>banana</b> <b>plantation</b> and once played in a match {{featuring}} George Headley. Gibson moved to England in 1944, accompanied by a friend, where he joined the Royal Air Force and saw service in the later stages of World War II while stationed near Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire. Following the war, Leicestershire County Cricket Club secretary Cecil Wood was given the task of building a team for the resumption of first-class cricket, with Gibson impressing Wood in friendly one-day matches against Northamptonshire and Nottinghamshire in 1945. He was offered the chance to play for Leicestershire in 1946, making two first-class appearances against Yorkshire in the County Championship at Headingley and Oxford University at the University Parks. He scored a total of 17 runs in his two matches, at an average of 5.66, with a high score of 11. He suffered arm and head injuries in a car accident midway through the 1946 season and was not reengaged by the county.|$|E

A total of 1,800people were evacuated in the resort town of Baguio, {{which is located}} [...] north of Manila, due to landslides. The typhoon leveled a <b>banana</b> <b>plantation</b> in the Pangasinan province and caused floods that damaged two bridges in Ilocos and Cagayan provinces. Across {{the capital city of}} Manila, heavy rains led to street flooding. Nationwide, 954homes were damaged and an additional 89were destroyed, which resulted in 55,567people or 13,247families that either south shelter or were homeless. Five people were killed in the country. The storm inflicted $5.58million in damage to the country, including $1.45million from agriculture and $4.13million from infrastructure.|$|E

He {{grew up in the}} Tweed area. During his early childhood his parents were a part of the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement, a German splinter group that broke away from the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the World War I era over military service and conscription. They rejoined the mainstream church when he was 10. According to Schwarz, this background gave him a disposition that was skeptical towards church leadership; although this assertion was removed when Floyd Greenleaf revised Schwarz' work. [...] As a youth he ran a large family <b>banana</b> <b>plantation</b> (near the location of what would become the tropical fruit theme park), and later sugar cane and banana plantations deep in the Queensland jungle. He spent his personal time doing study and research into theology.|$|E

60|$|They separated. Babalatchi {{crossed the}} {{courtyard}} towards the creek {{to get his}} canoe, and Mrs. Almayer walked slowly to the house, ascended the plankway, and passing through the back verandah entered the passage leading {{to the front of}} the house; but before going in she turned in the doorway and looked back at the empty and silent courtyard, now lit up by the rays of the rising moon. No sooner she had disappeared, however, than a vague shape flitted out from amongst the stalks of the <b>banana</b> <b>plantation,</b> darted over the moonlit space, and fell in the darkness at the foot of the verandah. It might have been the shadow of a driving cloud, so noiseless and rapid was its passage, but for the trail of disturbed grass, whose feathery heads trembled and swayed for a long time in the moonlight before they rested motionless and gleaming, like a design of silver sprays embroidered on a sombre background.|$|E
60|$|At {{night he}} would often take Lakamba's {{smallest}} canoe and depart silently to pay mysterious visits {{to his old}} chief {{on the other side}} of the river. Omar lived in odour of sanctity under the wing of Patalolo. Between the bamboo fence, enclosing the houses of the Rajah, and the wild forest, there was a <b>banana</b> <b>plantation,</b> and on its further edge stood two little houses built on low piles under a few precious fruit trees that grew on the banks of a clear brook, which, bubbling up behind the house, ran in its short and rapid course down to the big river. Along the brook a narrow path led through the dense second growth of a neglected clearing to the <b>banana</b> <b>plantation</b> and to the houses in it which the Rajah had given for residence to Omar. The Rajah was greatly impressed by Omar's ostentatious piety, by his oracular wisdom, by his many misfortunes, by the solemn fortitude with which he bore his affliction. Often the old ruler of Sambir would visit informally the blind Arab and listen gravely to his talk during the hot hours of an afternoon. In the night, Babalatchi would call and interrupt Omar's repose, unrebuked. Aissa, standing silently at the door of one of the huts, could see the two old friends as they sat very still by the fire in the middle of the beaten ground between the two houses, talking in an indistinct murmur far into the night. She could not hear their words, but she watched the two formless shadows curiously. Finally Babalatchi would rise and, taking her father by the wrist, would lead him back to the house, arrange his mats for him, and go out quietly. Instead of going away, Babalatchi, unconscious of Aissa's eyes, often sat again by the fire, in a long and deep meditation. Aissa looked with respect on that wise and brave man--she was accustomed to see at her father's side as long as she could remember--sitting alone and thoughtful in the silent night by the dying fire, his body motionless and his mind wandering in the land of memories, or--who knows?--perhaps groping for a road in the waste spaces of the uncertain future.|$|E
