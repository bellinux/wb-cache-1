40|$|We {{describe}} a de novo 3 q 27. 3 q 29 deletion in a 2. 5 -year-old female patient with developmental and growth delay, dysmorphic facial features, mild tricuspid valve dysplasia, <b>bifid</b> <b>thumb,</b> clinodactyly of the 2 nd toe bilaterally and scoliosis. The deletion overlaps for about 1 Mb with the 1. 6 Mb region commonly deleted {{in patients with}} 3 q 29 microdeletion syndrome. The phenotype of the two syndromes is not completely overlapping, though the most important clinical features, such as mental retardation and microcephaly, occur in both. This suggests that the deletion in our patient causes a distinct clinical phenotype, not described previously. In the deleted region there are 47 annotated genes. Among them, seven are of particular interest for correlation with clinical features of the patient. Two genes, OPA 1 and CCDC 50, responsible for autosomal dominant optic atrophy and deafness, respectively, may be important for the correct follow-up of the patient...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTTo {{report the}} {{frequencies}} of congenital hand diseases in patients who underwent surgery on a collective mobilization basis at SOS Hand, Recife, Pernambuco, between 2005 and 2009. Methods: Information was collected from 833 children and adolescents who were examined in eight missions. Results: Among the patients, 306 (36. 7 %) underwent surgery: 240 (78. 4 %) because of congenital malformation and 66 (21. 6 %) because of acquired lesions. The most frequent congenital malformations were: syndactyly, 72 cases (30. 0 %); polydactyly, 30 cases (12. 5 %); <b>bifid</b> <b>thumb,</b> 19 cases (7. 9 %); complex hand malformation, 14 cases (5. 8 %); cleft hand, 13 cases (5. 4 %); trigger finger, 12 cases (5. 0 %); camptodactyly, 11 cases (4. 6 %); and brachysyndactyly, 9 cases (3. 7 %). The most frequently acquired injuries were: obstetric traumatic lesions, 26 cases (39. 4 %); hand trauma sequelae, 18 cases (27. 3 %); cerebral paralysis sequelae, 7 cases (10. 6 %); electric shock sequelae, 5 cases (7. 6 %); and burn sequelae, 4 cases (6. 1 %). Conclusion: The nosology of hand diseases {{is similar to that}} of large series of elective surgery, especially regarding congenital deformities. The frequency of acquired hand lesions seems to be higher than the frequency in international series. The collective mobilization system for hand surgery is important for decreasing the need for this activity in public institutions, and it has been shown to be very efficient. The success of the project may provide support for the Brazilian National Health System to enroll hand surgeons in the on-call system, in emergency units...|$|E
40|$|The {{congenital}} {{differences of}} the thumb, that have as their main characteristic it’ s hypoplasia or aplasia, are very important, since they deprive {{the child of}} the unique in human species function of opposition. It is hard to estimate their incidence {{because of the presence}} of different classification systems and the deficiency of the registration mechanisms. Besides thumb hypoplasia or aplasia that occurs in isolation, and which is recently considered to be part of the radial longitudinal deficiency sequence (radial club hand), there are other congenital differences in which the thumb is hypoplastic or aplastic or there is deficiency of the 1 st web space and incapability of opposition. Such anomalies are <b>bifid</b> <b>thumb,</b> triphalangeal thumb in the form of “five fingered hand”, mirror hand where there are many hypoplastic digits in the place of the thumb, syndactyly between thumb and index, symbrachydactyly, the atypical form of cleft hand in which the radial digits are attached together, the constriction ring syndrome that concerns the thumb and generalized abnormalities and syndromes as Apert syndrome, Poland syndrome, Holt-Oram syndrome and arthrogryposis. In our effort to classify the 110 patients of our series according to the modified Blauth classification we realized that 41 % of them could not be included in any category. Thus we created a new classification system based on the well known IFSSH classification system for the congenital anomalies of the upper limb, in which we managed to include all of our hypoplastic thumb cases. Our classification system has as basic categories the failure of formation/undergrowth (A), the failure of differentiation (B), the duplication (C), the constriction ring syndrome (D) and the generalized anomalies and syndromes (E). We concluded that the only category of the IFSSH classification system that did not concern the hypoplastic thumb was overgrowth. As far as management is concerned, multiple surgical interventions were used in cases that there was such indication and parental consent, such as 1 st web space deepening, opponensplasty using the abductor digiti quinti or the flexor digitorum superficialis of the ring finger, lengthening of the metacarpal or the phalanx by using distraction osteogenesis, non vascularized phalangeal transfers from a toe or bone allografts, microvascular free toe transfer and index pollicization. In most of the cases the result was very good, in terms of function and cosmesis, in the opinion of both the patient’s environment and the surgeon. A table with the therapeutical guidelines, based on indications, was created. In the future it is possible that the management options will be modified, mainly with the evolution of genetic engineering. Until then it is crucial to use a common classification system and management guidelines that will include the whole of the congenital differences that concern the hypoplasia or aplasia of the most important human digit, the thumb. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{interstitial}} deletion in chromosome 7 (p 13 p 15) detected in amniotic fluid cells is presented. After termination, the fetus was noted {{to have an}} asymmetrical skull, low set ears, a flattened nose, <b>bifid</b> <b>thumbs</b> and right big toe, pyloric adenomyosis, hypospadias, and simian creases. A brief comparison is made with previously reported cases involving deletions of 7 p, including those associated with craniosynostosis...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} dysmorphic {{boy with a}} de novo partial trisomy 1 q. The boy has microcephaly, {{bilateral}} cleft lip and palate, low set and dysmorphic ears, brain anomalies, pulmonary stenosis, duodenal obstruction, dysplastic kidneys, and <b>bifid</b> <b>thumbs.</b> The trisomic segment 1 q 32 -qter is duplicated with an inverted insertion at 1 p 36. 3. The aberration was initially detected at amniocentesis and confirmed and defined by GTG banding, chromosome microdissection, and FISH on postnatal blood samples. The parents had normal karyotypes. De novo partial duplications of chromosome 1 q have rarely been reported. Comparison of our patient with other published pure trisomy 1 q cases showed similarities which allowed the further delineation of the trisomy 1 q syndrome...|$|R
40|$|A {{wide variety}} of cysts can be {{detected}} in the fetal abdomen and does not represent an uncommon finding at routine sonography. Cysts can originate from any intra-abdominal structure, even if most of them belong to the renal tract. Regardless of the underlying pathology, the typical sonographic presentation {{is that of a}} round, mainly anechoic structure of variable size, number and position within the fetal abdomen. This series describes a single centre’s experience in diagnosis and follow-up of fetuses with an intra-abdominal cyst that were detected or addressed to our referral hospital over 22 years. During this period, we collected a total of 100 cases. We excluded from this data collection the masses that at the first scan appeared to belong to the renal tract. The prenatal sonographic diagnosis were: 42 ovarian cysts, 23 dilated bowel loops (7 of which at the duodenal level), 15 umbilical vein varices, 3 choledochal cysts and 6 single cases associated to major anomalies. The remaining 11 cases could not be classified until delivery or longer. Fetuses were scanned approximately every two weeks until delivery or disappearance of the image. Most of these cysts were first detected in the third trimester. The latest diagnosis was that of ovarian cysts, with only one case of early detection at 20 weeks. Out of 35 cases with a complete follow-up, 10 persisted after delivery and 5 were surgically removed. The double bubble sign was detected in the third trimester 6 times out of seven cases, and among them two fetuses died in utero, while a fetus was affected by trisomy 18 and died a few days after birth. The remaining 4 cases underwent surgery and between them one was affected by trisomy 21 ond one other had a Meckel’s diverticulum and a <b>bifid</b> <b>thumb</b> associated with the duodenal atresia. Out of the remaining dilated bowel loops suspects, 3 were confirmed after delivery, one died in utero, one was diagnosed with a congenital chloride diarrhea and one died when she was two months old and a Jeune’s syndrome was suspected. The others had disappeared during prenatal scans or they were normal anatomic variant of bowel loops. Between the fifteen umbilical vein varices 13 were isolated, and the newborns were alive and well. In our case records three cysts were considered to belong to the choledocus: two disappeared during the prenatal follow up and one was still detectable at birth with no sign of biliary atresia. Among the rarer diagnosis, we collected some fetal tumors (hepatic hamartoma, hepatic cavernous hemangioma, sacrococcygeal teratoma, lymphangioma) and some complex syndromes. These pathologies were detected in the mid trimester. Especially intriguing was the finding of 11 abdominal cysts of unclear origin at diagnosis. Five disappeared during the prenatal follow- up, and among these one fetus subsequently died in utero and no abdominal cyst was found at autopsy; on the contrary, one cyst was not detected at neonatal sonography, but four months later an enteric duplication was found and the baby underwent surgery. Among those that were still detectable at the last prenatal scan one had meconium peritonitis and one had a complex syndrome with the cyst ascribable to a hydrometrocolpos. Among 100 patients, 5 requested termination of pregnancy because of the detection of associated major anomalies, while five fetuses died spontaneously in utero (2 duodenal atresias, 1 jejunum obstruction, 1 hepatic cavernous hemangioma and the above mentioned cyst disappeared during prenatal scans). Three babies died after delivery because of major syndromes (a trisomy 18, a cloacal anomaly and a Jeune’s syndrome). Our findings support the importance of the routine third trimester ultrasound scan, in fact both a planned delivery and a prompt intervention after delivery might be relevant to treat some of the underlying pathology. Moreover our findings support the importance of a close surveillance of both the fetus and the newborn even when the images are no longer detected during pregnancy or at birth...|$|E
