5|$|Gastroenteritis {{typically}} involves both {{diarrhea and}} vomiting, or less commonly, presents {{with only one}} or the other. Abdominal cramping may also be present. Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72hours after contracting the infectious agent. If due to a viral agent, the condition usually resolves within one week. Some viral causes may also <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain. If the stool is bloody, the cause {{is less likely to}} be viral and more likely to be bacterial. Some bacterial infections may <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the financial crises in Argentina and Turkey {{in order to}} find out whether a set of six major macroeconomic indicators account for these crises or not. Evidence suggests that in Turkey, an increase in domestic credit <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the 1992, 1994 and 2001 financial crises, whereas an increase in CPI <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> all crisis episodes. Similarly, a decrease in exchange rate <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> all crises. A fall in the market index <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> financial crises in 1991, 1992 and 1994. An increase in M 1 <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> only <b>with</b> the crisis in 1992 and a fall in the volume of exports relative to volume of imports <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the crisis in 1994. In Argentina, an increase in neither CPI nor domestic credit <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> any of the financial crises. A decrease in exchange rate <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> all crises, whereas a fall in the market index <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> financial crises in 1991 and 2000.

5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} can <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> minor complications such as broken teeth or lacerations of {{the tissues}} {{of the upper}} airway.

Because of this, the potential for difficulty or complications due to the presence of unusual airway anatomy or other uncontrolled variables is carefully evaluated before undertaking tracheal intubation. Alternative strategies for securing the airway must always be readily available.|$|E
