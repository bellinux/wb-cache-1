40|$|Modern {{agriculture}} {{relies heavily}} {{on the use of}} chemicals for pest control to increase crop yields. However, improper handling and disposal of pesticides and pesticide waste may compromise surface water and groundwater quality. In farmyards, point-source contamination includes spills occurring during filling operations, sprayer rinsate, leaks, internal and external sprayer cleaning, and spray leftovers, and accounts for 40 to 90 % of surface water and groundwater contamination by pesticides. Over the years, various biopurification systems have been developed to minimize the risk of point-source contamination by pesticides. One such system is the <b>biobed.</b> It consists of an active matrix (straw, peat or compost, and topsoil) in a ratio of 2 : 1 : 1 (v/v/v) in a pit. The effectiveness of the <b>biobed</b> mix is based on its ability to adsorb pesticides into its active matrix or stimulate their rapid biodegradation by offering suitable biological and physicochemical conditions for optimum microbial activity. The objective of this project was to study the efficiency of biobeds under Saskatchewan climatic conditions. Two laboratory studies and one field study were conducted in Saskatoon, SK. In the first laboratory study, the degradation of 2, 4 -D dimethylamine salt (2, 4 -D DMA) in single and multiple additions to the <b>biobed</b> mix and topsoil was investigated at 20 and 15 oC, respectively. In both studies, net CO 2 evolution was correlated with 2, 4 -D degradation. Degradation of 2, 4 -D was more rapid in the <b>biobed</b> mix, with more than 99. 9 % degradation in 10 d, compared to topsoil with only 35 % degradation in 28 d of incubation at 20 oC. In the multiple additions experiment, more than 99. 9 and 70 % of the applied amount of 2, 4 -D DMA was degraded in the <b>biobed</b> mix and topsoil, respectively, within 60 d of incubation at 15 oC. A mass balance showed that 93 and 51 % of the C added as 2, 4 -D dimethylamine salt was mineralized within 60 d of incubation at 15 oC in the <b>biobed</b> mix and topsoil, respectively. These results suggest that net CO 2 could be used as an indicator of 2, 4 -D DMA degradation in the <b>biobed</b> mix and topsoil used. A second laboratory experiment examined the degradation of seven pesticides at three temperatures (5, 13, and 20 oC). Pesticide degradation was more rapid at 20 oC compared to 13 and 5 oC. A significant interaction (sampling time x temperature) was observed in the degradation of thifensulfuron-methyl, 2, 4 -D DMA, pyrasulfotole, and bromoxynil. For metsulfuron-methyl, tribenuron-methyl, and thiencarbazone-methyl, degradation was a function of sampling time and temperature with no interaction. After 35 d of incubation at 20 oC, 38, 94, 99, 77, 77, and 99 % of applied amounts of metsulfuron-methyl, tribenuron-methyl, thifensulfuron-methyl, thiencarbazone-methyl, pyrasulfotole, and bromoxynil, respectively, were degraded while more than 99 % of the applied amount of 2, 4 -D DMA was degraded within 7 d. The results suggest that high pesticide degradation could be anticipated during warm conditions (summer) compared to fall or spring. A field study examined the degradation of six pesticides in two designs of <b>biobed</b> (the traditional below-ground <b>biobed</b> and a newly designed above-ground <b>biobed)</b> during two growing seasons. The above-ground <b>biobed</b> reached peak temperatures faster than the traditional below-ground <b>biobed</b> and was more efficient in water management. The above-ground <b>biobed</b> was more vulnerable to pesticide leaching out of the bottom compared to the below-ground <b>biobed.</b> The most leached pesticide was metsulfuron-methyl, with 4 and less than 0. 01 % of the applied amount leaching out of the bottom of the above-ground <b>biobed</b> and below-ground <b>biobed,</b> respectively. More than 99 % of the applied amounts of tribenuron-methyl, thifensulfuron-methyl, thiencarbazone-methyl, pyrasulfotole, and 2, 4 -D DMA were either retained by the <b>biobed</b> matrix or degraded within 2 growing seasons in both biobeds. This research shows that biobeds are capable of degrading herbicides from different chemical classes and could be used to reduce surface water and groundwater contamination arising from point sources in Saskatchewan in particular and the prairies in general. However, consideration in their design should include leaching potential, water management, early-season <b>biobed</b> temperature and they must be closed...|$|E

In this study, we assess {{the effectiveness of}} a three-stage on-farm <b>biobed</b> for treating pesticide contaminated waste water from a large (20 km 2) commercial arable estate. The facility consisted of an enclosed machinery wash-down unit (stage 1), a 49 m 2 lined compost-straw-topsoil <b>biobed</b> (stage 2), and a 200 m 2 drainage field with a trickle irrigation system (stage 3). Pesticide concentrations were analysed in water samples collected fortnightly between November 2013 and November 2015 from the <b>biobed</b> input and output sumps and from 20 porous pots buried at 45 cm and 90 cm depth within the drainage field. The results revealed that the <b>biobed</b> removed 68 – 98 % of individual pesticides within the contaminated washings, with mean total pesticide concentrations reducing by 91. 6 % between the <b>biobed</b> input and output sumps. Drainage field irrigation removed a further 68 – 99 % of individual pesticides, with total mean pesticide concentrations reducing by 98. 4 % and 97. 2 % in the 45 cm and 90 cm depth porous pots, respectively. The average total pesticide concentration at 45 cm depth in the drainage field (57 µg L- 1) was 760 times lower than the mean concentration recorded in the input sump (43, 334 µg L- 1). There was no evidence of seasonality in the efficiency of <b>biobed</b> pesticide removal, nor was there evidence of a decline in removal efficiency over the two-year monitoring period. However, higher mean total pesticide concentrations at 90 cm (102 µg L- 1) relative to 45 cm (57 µg L- 1) depth indicated an accumulation of pesticide residues deeper within the soil profile.

All fungal isolates evaluated were efficient in colonizing the surface and inner parts of the PS and without differences observed in the colonization over the assay.

40|$|Up to 95 % of the {{contamination}} of surface water by pesticides comes from on-farm point sources {{in connection with}} washing and preparation operations. This contamination {{is a growing concern}} for environment and human health. Because of their efficiency, their low cost and their friendly and simple use, Biobeds were recognized as the best tool to treat these pesticide effluents. Assuming a single passage of the effluent through the <b>Biobed</b> followed by release of the percolate, the research focused on the efficiency of the depuration after a single percolation. Accounting for unknown hazards such as metabolites and bound residues leads, however, local rules in Europe to enjoin a recycling of the effluent until full evaporation to prevent any release in the environment. Managed as such, we show that the Biobeds are waterlogged and no longer perform the elimination of the effluent. This induces large hazards of either direct volatilization or effluent release, and goes with increased costs, dissatisfaction or demotivation of the farmers, thus jeopardizing the development of this solution. Accounting for these new depuration conditions leads to a new <b>Biobed</b> paradigm, namely optimization of the transpiration of the water rather than optimization of the single percolation depuration, which leads to sharp changes in <b>Biobed</b> forms, content and management. Moreover, the corresponding new system shows larger performance, decreased space and maintenance requirements, and improved aesthetics.

40|$|Pesticides {{are used}} to control diseases, {{undesired}} vegetation and insects in forestry, gardening and agriculture. In the environment, pesticides are generally believed to originate from a diffuse source, such as spray drift of pesticides during application, or a point source, such as spills during refill and cleaning of spraying equipment. Point sources are easier to eliminate than diffuse sources and one method to reduce the leaching from point sources is to use biobeds as bioprophylaxis. The Swedish <b>biobed</b> was developed by Torstensson and Castillo in 199 X (KB) and is constructed with locally available constituents, such as peat, wheat straw and soil. The main advantages of the <b>biobed</b> {{is that it is}} very simple and cheap, but still very effective. On sites where vegetable oil have been spilled on the <b>biobed,</b> e. g on farms producing rapeseed oil, both increased activity of lignin degrading microorganisms and increased pesticide degradation have been observed. The lignin degrading microorganisms produce unspecific extracellular enzymes, which also are able to degrade recalcitrant molecules such as organic pollutants. The most important ligninolytic enzymes, currently known, are lignin peroxidase (LiP), manganese peroxidase (MnP) and laccase. Pure MnP {{have been found to be}} able to initiate lipid peroxidation. Due to recent findings that vegetable oil, which has high levels of unsaturated fatty acids, is increasing the effect of lignin degrading microorganisms, addition of oil is proposed to further increase the <b>biobed</b> efficiency. Since the crop is determining which pesticide to be used, pesticides are often encountered in mixtures in the environment. For this purpose five selected pesticides will represent the mixture of pesticides. The selected pesticides are bentazone (BZ), metabenzthiazuron (MBTZ), isoproturon (IP), terbutylazine (TBA) and chlorpyrifos (CLP). The main objectives of this study were: I. To investigate whether the addition of rapeseed oil to the biomix (mixture of peat, soil and straw used in a <b>biobed)</b> enhanced the degradation rate of pesticides (BZ, MBTZ, IP, TBA and CLP). II. To investigate whether a potential increase in degradation, of the same pesticide mixture, was explained by a MnP-mediated lipid peroxidation process. The experiment was set up to study whether the addition of oil can have a positive effect on degradation of a mixture of pesticides in a biomix and in soil. Enzymatic activity and microbial respiration were followed during the incubation period. The degradation of the pesticides by pure MnP in the presence of oil was tested in vitro. The experiment was prepared for each pesticide separate and a control without any pesticide added, in total six experimental setups. The main results from these studies are summarized below: • The effect from the addition of oil varies from promoting degradation to inhibiting degradation depending on pesticide. The lack of correlation with phenoloxidase activity could indicate that degradation mechanisms other than ligninolytic enzymes were prevailing or even dominant in this study. • The microbial respiration was higher in biomix than in soils. The addition of oil had an inhibitory effect in the biomix. • The phenoloxidase activity was higher in the biomix compared to the soil. The addition of oil did not increase the enzymatic activity. • In the in vitro experiments the addition of oil enhanced the degradation of IP by MnP, but no positive effect was observed for CLP, TBA, BZ and MBTZ. However, no enhancement of IP degradation was obtained in the biomix in the presence of rapeseed oil. • The initial method for the HPLC analysis was developed so all five pesticides could be detected within a reasonable time frame. However, with the oil-fractions peaking around MTBZ and BZ, and the fact that CLP had to be analysed separately, a new method also for the other four pesticides need to be developed for further studies. The new method for the four pesticides should separate the peaks around BZ and MBTZ further and not take CLP into account. • The interference peak in the chromatograms which increased over the incubation time could a product from vegetable oil being degraded in presence of of MnP could possibly indicate lipid. ...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the sorption–desorption potential of three pesticides with contrasting physico-chemical properties (bentazone, boscalid, and pyrimethanil) on novel biofilter materials based on bioenergy residues (mixtures of soil with digestate and/or biochar) in laboratory batch equilibrium experiments. The results show that the biomixtures of digestate and biochar with soil increased pesticides sorption potential and the 1 /ndes values were lower than the 1 /nads values indicating that the desorption was hysteretic for all pesticides on these materials. The adsorption and desorption of all the chemicals conformed to linear and Freundlich isotherms. Higher values of distribution [Kd (> 78 L kg− 1) ] and Freundlich sorption coefficient [Kf (> 900 μg 1 – 1 /n L 1 /n kg− 1) ] were observed for all pesticides for the digestate and biochar based mixtures compared with the blank soil, which was attributed to the lower organic carbon content of the latter. However, unlike for sorption there was no statistically significant difference between the biochar and the digestate mixtures for pesticides desorption (p > 0. 05; t-test). Specific UV-absorbances at 254 nm (SUVA 254) indicated the aromatic character of digestate (5 and 30 %) and biochar (5 %) biomixture, which showed the highest organic-carbon-partition coefficients (Koc) and/or Kd values amongst all biomixtures for all pesticides.

In a second trial, a high correlation of lower TCP with increasing levels of straw in typical Swedish biomixes was observed. Straw stimulates production of lignin-degrading enzymes such as manganese peroxidase (MnP), and further trials with pure MnP showed that this enzyme degrades TCP.

Six different sprayers were examined, Airtec, conventional sprayer (three types of nozzles, TeeJet XR, Lurmark DriftBeta and Hardi Injet), Danfoil, Hardi Twin, Kyndestoft and Släpduk. The study does not include accidental spillage from supply tanks or leakage from pipes etc. that may occur in everyday practise. A tracer dye, Nigrosin WLF, was added to the spray liquid. After spraying the sprayer and tractor were washed over a catchment pool containing a fixed volume of water. A small centrifugal pump was used to re—circulate the water. The concentrations of Nigrosin in the rinse water and in the spray liquid were determined by using a spectrophotometer. By comparing these concentrations, the amount of Nigrosin immobilised on the tractor and sprayer was determined. The sprayer was divided into two areas that were rinsed separately, the booms and the tank (every part of the sprayer except for the booms). The tractor was also divided into two areas, the front (radiator, bonnet and engine) and the back (the rest). All wheels were excluded. An average of between 0, 01 % - 0, 60 % of the sprayed tracer dye (active substance) was found on the tractor and sprayer after spraying had been carried out. The largest accumulation, 50 - 98 % of the accumulated deposition, was observed on the booms. The largest deposition was observed on the air-assisted sprayers, Kyndestoft (0, 60 % of the sprayed amount) and Hardi Twin (0, 46 %). Släpduk received the third largest deposition (0, 36 %). 0, 06 % of the sprayed tracer dye was observed on Danfoil and Airtec. The deposition on the conventional sprayer with TeeJet XR nozzles was 0, 04 % and on the same sprayer with Lurmark DriftBeta 0, 02 %.

Average ammonia (NH 3) and odour removal efficiencies were 42 - 62 %. NH 3 outlet concentrations appeared rather constant and independent of fluctuations in inlet concentrations, so higher inlet concentrations led to higher calculated removal efficiencies.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Biobeds {{have been}} well studied in {{northern}} Europe, whereas little is known regarding their use in southern Europe. The degradation and adsorption of terbuthylazine (TA) and chlorpyrifos (CP) were studied in three different biomixtures composed of composted cotton crop residues, soil and straw in various proportions, and also in sterilised and non-sterilised soil. RESULTS: Compost biomixtures degraded the less hydrophobic TA {{at a faster rate}} than soil, while the opposite was evident for the more hydrophobic CP. These results were attributed to the rapid abiotic hydrolysis of CP in the alkaline soil (pH 8. 5) compared with the lower pH of the compost (6. 6), but also to the increasing adsorption (K(d) = 746 mL g(- 1)) and reduced bioavailability of CP in the biomixtures compared with soil (K(d) = 17 mL g(- 1)), as verified by the adsorption studies. CONCLUSIONS: Compost had a dual but contrasting effect on degradation that depended on the chemical nature of the pesticide studied: a positive effect towards TA owing to increasing biodegradation and a negative effect towards CP owing to increasing adsorption. Overall, composted cotton crop residues could be potentially used in local <b>biobed</b> systems in Greece, as they promoted the degradation of hydrophilic pesticides and the adsorption of hydrophobic pesticides.

40|$|<b>Biobed</b> {{substrates}} commonly exhibit high degradation capacity. However, degradation {{does not}} always lead to detoxification and information on the metabolic pathways of pesticides in biobeds is scarce. We studied the degradation and metabolism of three pesticides in selected biomixtures and soil. Biomixtures stimulated degradation of terbuthylazine and metribuzin, whereas chlorpyrifos degraded faster in soil. The latter was attributed to the lipophilicity of chlorpyrifos which increased adsorption and limited biodegradation in organic-rich biomixtures. Although the same metabolites were detected in all substrates, qualitative and quantitative differences in the metabolic routes of pesticides in the various substrates were observed. Chlorpyrifos was hydrolyzed to 3, 5, 6 -tricholorpyridinol (TCP) which was further degraded only in compost-biomixture CBX 1. Metabolism of terbuthylazine in compost biomixtures (BX) and soil resulted {{in the formation of}} desethyl-terbuthylazine (DES) which was fully degraded only in the compost-biomixture CBX 2, whereas peat-based biomixture (OBX) promoted the hydroxylation of terbuthylazine. Desamino- (DA) (dominant) and diketo- (DK) metribuzin appear as intermediate metabolites in all substrates and were further transformed to desamino-diketo-metribuzin (DADK) which was fully degraded only in compost-biomixture GSBX. Overall, lower amounts of metabolites were accumulated in biomixtures compared to soil stressing the higher depuration efficiency of biobeds. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Incubation studies showed that straw was essential in maintaining a high pesticide degradation capacity of the biomixture, whereas compost, when mixed with soil, retarded pesticide degradation. The highest rates of degradation were shown in the biomixture composed of soil/compost/straw suggesting that all three components are essential for maximum <b>biobed</b> performance. Increasing doses prolonged the persistence of most pesticides with biomixtures showing a higher tolerance to high pesticide dose levels compared to soil. Increasing the incubation temperature from 15 degrees C to 25 degrees C resulted in lower t(1 / 2) values, with biomixtures performing better than soil at the lower temperature. Repeated applications led to a decrease in the degradation rates of most pesticides in all the substrates, with the exception of iprodione and metalaxyl. Overall, our results stress the ability of biomixtures to perform better than soil under unfavorable conditions and extreme pesticide dose levels...|$|E

40|$|<b>Biobed</b> {{system is}} a simple method to {{minimize}} point source contamination during manipulation of pesticides {{and is based on}} the adsorption and degradation potential of a biomix composed by top soil, peat, and straw and covered with a grass layer. In our study, the biomix was prepared with Andisol, peat and straw in a volumetric proportion of 1 : 1 : 2, and adsorption and degradation studies were done. Degradation of chlorpyrifos (160 mg a. i. kg- 1) and formation of TCP (3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyrinidol) at different pre-incubation times (0, 15 and 30 days) and with different moisture contents (40, 60 and 80 % of water holding capacity) were evaluated, ligninolytic enzyme activity and microbial respiration in the biomix were periodically analyzed. Adsorption isotherms were fitted using Freundlich and linear models for Andisol and the biomix. The adsorption assays demonstrated that biomix has a higher capacity to retain chlorpyrifos than top soil. The pre-incubation period, WHC and the concentration of the chlorpyrifos of the biomix influenced the degradation of the contaminant and TCP formation as well as the biological activities in the biomix. The TCP was formed during the first steps of chlorpyrifos degradation and was later degraded in the biomix under all studied conditions. In conclusion, biomix with Andisol, peat and straw (1 : 1 : 2), pre-incubated by 15 days and incubated with 60 % of WHC is capable to degrade chlorpyrifos efficiently...|$|E
40|$|Biobeds {{have been}} used in {{northern}} Europe for minimizing point source contamination of water resources by pesticides. However, little is known regarding their use in southern Europe where edaphoclimatic conditions and agriculture practices significantly differ. A first step toward their adaptation in southern Europe is the use of low-cost and easily available substrates as biomixture components. This study investigated the possibility of replacing peat with agricultural composts in the biomixture. Five composts from local substrates including olive leaves, cotton crop residues, cotton seeds, spent mushroom substrate, and commercial sea wrack were mixed with topsoil and straw (1 : 1 : 2). Degradation of a mixture of pesticides (dimethoate, indoxacarb, buprofezin, terbuthylazine, metribuzin, metalaxyl-M, iprodione, azoxystrobin) at two dose rates was tested in the compost biomixtures (BX), in corresponding peat biomixtures (OBX), and in soil. Adsorption-desorption of selected pesticides were also studied. Pesticide residues were determined by gas chromatography with nitrogen phosphorus detector, except indoxacarb, which was determined with a microelectron capture detector. Overall, BX degraded the studied pesticides at rates markedly higher than those observed in soil and OBX, in which the slowest degradation rates were evident. Overall, the olive leaf compost biomixture showed the highest degradation capacity. Adsorption studies showed that OBX and BX had higher adsorption affinity compared to soil. Desorption experiments revealed that pesticide adsorption in biomixtures was not entirely reversible. The results suggest that substitution of peat with local composts will lead to optimization of the <b>biobed</b> system for use in Mediterranean countries...|$|E
40|$|Degradation of the {{insecticide}} chlorpynfos (160 a. i mg kg- 1) using a biomix of a <b>biobed</b> system biostimulated with inorganic fertilizer (NPK) was investigated. Three {{concentrations of}} the fertilizer (0. 1 %, 0. 5 % and 1. 0 % ww- 1) were evaluated on chlorpynfos degradation, TCP (3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyrinidol) accumulation and biological {{activity of the}} biomix. The chlorpynfos was dissipated efficiently (> 75 %) after 40 days of incubation and no additional dissipation was obtained with increasing concentration of NPK after 20 days of incubation. TCP accumulation occuned in all evaluated NPK concentrations and its concentration increased with the increment of NPK addition raising the probability of leaching of this compound. Biological activity (FDA and ligninolytic enzyme activity) in the biomix increased by the NPK presence in all evaluated concentrations. The DGGE analyses showed that combined treatments with lower amounts of NPK (0 % and 0. 1 %) and chlorpynfos showed no significant modifications in the microbial community in the biomix. However, combined overdoses of NPK (0. 5 and 1. 0 %) and chlorpynfos caused significant modifications in the bacterial communities that could be associated with TCP degradation reduction in the biomix. In conclusion, the obtained results demonstrated that the biomix prepared with Andisol and biostimulated with NPK nutrient can be recommended in biobeds as a viable alternative of chlorpyrifos dissipation avoiding soil and water contamination probability...|$|E

30|$|The results {{demonstrated}} that the proliferation of fungal mycelia of A. discolor was significantly higher in the formulation F 1 (high flaxseed content). Flaxseed contains approximately 28 % lignocellulose, 23 % lignin, 25 % hemicellulose, and 47 % cellulose (Coskuner and Karababa 2007). At {{least some of the}} cellulose present in flaxseed may be readily degraded by WRF encouraging good growth and increasing the amount of ligninolytic enzymes that can be produced (Sanchez 2009). The results obtained of MnP with high activity in F 1 are concordant with those previously published which associate A. discolor with a high capacity to produce MnP (Tortella et al. 2008; Rubilar et al. 2011; Bustamante et al. 2011; Acevedo et al. 2011; Elgueta et al. 2012).

40|$|Background: The <b>biobed</b> is {{a simple}} biopurification system used to prevent the point-source {{pesticide}} contamination that occurs at farm level. The typical composition of the biomixture used in this system is soil, peat and straw in volumetric proportions of 1 : 1 : 2. The principal component is straw due to its positive effects on biological activity and thus pesticide degradation. However, access to straw can be limited in some regions, {{so it must be}} replaced by other more readily available lignocellulosic residues. Results: Therefore, two alternate lignocellulosic materials (barley husks and pine sawdust) were evaluated as partial substitutes for straw. The degradation of a repeatedly applied mixture of six pesticides by these alternates was assessed. The microbial respiration and fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis activity were also assessed. The results showed that the highest degradation efficiency was found in mixtures containing straw and barley husks. Each biomixtures tested achieved a high degradation (50 to 90 %) of all the pesticides used except iprodione. Repeated applications of pesticides resulted in a slowing of the degradation rate of all pesticide types in all biomixtures. FDA activity and microbial respiration were higher in the biomixtures containing barley husks and straw compared to the mixture with pine sawdust, a result consistent with the pesticide degradations observed. Conclusions: This paper demonstrates that the straw in the traditional biomixture can be partially replaced by other lignocellulosic materials to efficiently degrade a mixture of pesticides, even when the pesticides are added in successive applications and high concentrations...|$|E

An adsorption/desorption experiment was also performed to assess the retention capacity of substrates tested against fungicide metalaxyl. The goal of the work was {{to determine the extent of}} the adsorption/desorption of the mobile fungicide metalaxyl in substrates containing different amounts and quality of organic carbon and to characterize the relationship between the carbon fractions and the adsorption/desorption parameters determined. The Kads values found in the organic substrates turned out to be higher than those reported for soils, indicating the highest sorption capability of these materials and their suitability to be used as bio-filters for decontaminating water. The quality of organic carbon strongly influenced the entity and the reversibility of bonds between substrates and fungicide. The influence of different organic fractions on the adsorption of metalaxyl can be summarized in the order of humic acids carbon > total humified extractable carbon > total organic carbon > total carbon, leading to the conclusion that the presence of the humified fraction in the organic substrates is essential for a good performance of biofilters. Indeed, the desorption experiment evidenced that metalaxyl is less desorbed in the most humified substrates. Therefore, in bio-depuration systems such as <b>biobed</b> it is convenient to use mature substrates, which have to undergo a composting process, leading to high humus content and quality, responsible for irreversible bonds with pesticides...|$|E

The experiment was conducted when equipments were washed in a <b>biobed</b> after treatments. Commercial formulates of dimetomorph(DF), pen- conazole(PC), azoxystrobin(AZ), metalaxyl(MX), ﬂudioxonil(FL) and cyprodinil(CY) were mixed and downloaded onto the bio mix- ture following concentrations and time schedule of treatments for grapevine season during 112 days. Pesticides degradation was monitored by measuring the residual concentration over the time. he evolution of microbial community were monitored using culture-dependent and independent methods such as viable plate count and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) to describe the inﬂuence of fungicides on microbial diversity. Rela- tion between microorganisms variation and fungicide degradation was investigated to improve the system efﬁciency. Results showed a good capability of biomix to degrade pesticides.

In {{the absence of}} effective depuration methods, they are discharged in municipal wastewater treatment plants or spread to land. Modified biobeds could be an applicable solution for their treatment. We studied the dissipation of thiabendazole (TBZ), imazalil (IMZ), ortho-phenylphenol (OPP), diphenylamine (DPA) and ethoxyquin (EQ), used by the fruit-packaging industry, in anaerobically digested sewage sludge, liquid aerobic sewage sludge and in various organic substrates (biobeds packing materials) composed of soil, straw and spend mushroom substrate (SMS) in various volumetric ratios. Pesticide sorption was also determined. TBZ and IMZ showed higher persistence especially in the anaerobically digested sewage sludge (DT 50 = 32. 3 - 257. 6 d), in contrast to OPP and DPA which were rapidly dissipated especially in liquid aerobic sewage sludge (DT 50 = 1. 3 - 9. 3 d). EQ was rapidly oxidized mainly to quinone imine (QI) which did not persist and dimethyl ethoxyquinoline (EQNL, minor metabolite) which persisted for longer. Sterilization of liquid aerobic sewage sludge inhibited pesticide decay verifying the microbial nature of pesticide dissipation. Organic substrates rich in SMS showed the highest dissipation capacity with TBZ and IMZ DT 50 s of ca. 28 d compared to DT 50 s of > 50 d in the other substrates. TBZ and IMZ showed the highest sorption affinity, whereas OPP and DPA were weakly sorbed. Our findings suggest that current disposal practices could not guarantee an efficient depuration of effluents from the fruit-packaging industry, whereas SMS-rich <b>biobed</b> organic substrates show efficient depuration of effluents from the fruit-packaging industry via accelerated dissipation even of recalcitrant fungicides.

Average empty bed residence times (EBRT) were 1. 4, 2. 6, and 3. 3 s; average pressure drops were 287, 22, and 91 Pa, respectively. Average ammonia (NH 3) and odour removal efficiencies per site were 38 – 74 % and 43 – 62 %, respectively; a large variation {{was found between}} measurements. Poor moisture control of the packing material decreased these efficiencies (breakthrough). Average fine dust (PM 10) removal was mostly 90 % or higher.

In addition, Tortella et al. (2013) evaluated a biomixture supplemented with terpenes during atrazine degradation. These authors found that the biomixture suplemented with 50 -µg kg− 1 of limonene or eucalyptol gave t 1 / 2 of atrazine of 9  days, which was {{significantly lower than the}} control (13  days).

40|$|Worldwide, water {{contamination}} from agricultural {{use of pesticides}} has receivedincreasing attention within the last decades. In general, sources of pesticide waterpollution are categorized into diffuse (indirect) and point sources (direct). To reducepoint pollution from farm yards, where the spray equipment is washed, <b>biobed</b> orbiofilter systems are conventionally used to treat the washing water. The organicmaterial usually used in these systems is often not environmentally sustainable (e. g. peat) and incorporated organic material such as straw leads to a highlyheterogeneous water flow, with negative effects on the retention and degradationbehavior of the pesticides. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} present study was tosubstitute the classical materials (peat and straw) with bioenergy residues namelybiochar and digestate to investigate their effects on fate of pesticides in soil atdifferent mixing ratios. Prior to study the pesticides fate, the microbial respiration was measured over 3 months to gain information about the turnover rate of the organic biomixtures, whichcan be used as an indirect indicator of the soils/biomixture degradation potential forpesticides and provides information about the long-term stability of the material. Mixtures of biochar and digestate showed an intermediate CO 2 flux compared to thesingle addition of biochar or digestate, whereby the oxygen consumption in presenceof biochar was generally significantly lower compared to the consumption afteraddition of digestate only. Additionally, to correlate the microbial respiration with thedissipation (or degradation) potential of pesticides a laboratory incubation study wasperformed over 135 days with three contrasting pesticides (bentazone, boscalid, andpyrimethanil). In general, biochar based mixtures resulted in stronger binding of allstudied pesticides, and therefore, ensued higher dissipation. On the other hand, 5 %and 30 % digestate based mixtures enhanced mineralization and addition of 5 %biochar to these mixtures showed a desired balance between stronger sequestrationand mineralization for all pesticides. A sorption-desorption study revealed thatbiochar and digestate based mixtures caused stronger sorption for all compoundscompared to bare soil.
