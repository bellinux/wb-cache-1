30|$|The {{numerous}} studies on rock samples {{have shown that}} failure of the polycrystalline medium such as rocks is not instant process. It follows in time and is prepared by accumulation and interaction of the microfractures which result the rupture or shear macrofracture forming [18]. The variations of the physics-mechanics rock properties preceding to the failure allows using the different geophysical methods sensitive to such variations with an objective to predict the failure. It first is related to seismic-acoustic methods based on monitoring of the different waves spreading in the deformed medium, their velocity and attenuation (closely connected with the microfractures parameters) measurement [19, 20] and acoustic emission observation [21, 12, 22]. In spite of {{the high level of}} the modern <b>loading</b> <b>machines</b> and laboratory test equipment for samples testing, it is necessary to study the large volume of the rock in situ.
