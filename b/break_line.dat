2500|$|For 1961, new 2-door {{sedan and}} hardtop models were released, but no {{changes were made}} to the 4-door sedan and wagon sheet metal. The {{interior}} and exterior trim were changed to provide model year differentiation, a mild form of planned obsolescence. The radiator grille stamping was the same as in 1960, but for 1961 it was painted with a pattern of black squares. The central grille ornament was still pulled from the bottom to release the hood, but it was now faced with an emblem having a white field with the blue-and-red stylized [...] "V" [...] Valiant logo, rather than 1960's red field with gold script [...] "Valiant" [...] callout. The side trim was changed; a [...] stainless spear was placed at the rear of each tailfin crease, a hockey stick-shaped trim was applied to the lower <b>break</b> <b>line,</b> and the front fender/door crease was capped with a long stainless spear. The tailfins were each topped with three transverse chrome strips, and a large horizontal emblem containing a round plastic [...] "V200" [...] callout was centered in the deck lid's spare-tire stamping. Matching round [...] "V200" [...] callouts were placed in round housings at the midpoint of the front fender spears. Inside the car, the instrument cluster was largely carried over, but 1960's black gauges with white callouts gave way to 1961's white gauges with black callouts.|$|E

50|$|The Warner House is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, with walls 15 {{in thick}} laid in Flemish bond. A belt course {{separates}} {{the two main}} floors, and the slightly overhanging cornice is studded with modillions.

At the <b>break</b> <b>line</b> in the gambrel there is a low balustrade. The cupola was listed in the original 1716-bill by John Drew, master-builder.

50|$|If {{a scratch}} or other foul occurs while playing the 8 ball, {{as long as}} the {{opponent}} has at least one ball of his group present on the table and the 8 ball is not pocketed, the game continues. In both cases of this foul-on-the-8 situation, the opponent gets two chances (regardless of whether any balls are potted on the first chance) before the fouling player may shoot again. In these circumstances, treatment of the cue ball depends on the type of foul. If the cue ball had been scratched, the cue ball must be placed behind the <b>break</b> <b>line.</b> If it was some other foul which had occurred while playing the 8 ball, the cue ball is not moved. If the incoming opponent scratches, the player who originally fouled now receives two chances. When the 8 ball is the only ball on the table, any kind of foul ends the game, and the opponent of the fouling player wins.|$|E
5000|$|Smoke screen: In urban {{settings}} or other environments with limited movement and fields of view, smoke {{can be an}} effective means to screen friendly movement. This can be used either to pass through and escape, or to close in on and eliminate the enemy sniper. Ordinary soldiers can still do damage through smoke by firing randomly or on intuition, but snipers lose their precision advantage and are far less likely to hit anything with their much lower possible shot volume. A determined enemy, such as an emplaced heavy machine gun, will fire randomly through smoke, so this is a dangerous tactic. It {{should also be noted that}} weapons of opportunity may also provide a smoke screen, anything from igniting a car's gas tank, oil drum, or using fragmentation grenades to throw up debris and quickly <b>break</b> <b>line</b> of sight and concentration. Flash-bang (distraction) grenades have a wider blast radius than fragmentation grenades.|$|E
50|$|Just {{before the}} gun, Kenya's Eglay Nafuna Nalanya flinched, almost disqualifying their team, but she righted herself before the gun. The first runner to the <b>break</b> <b>line</b> was American Chanelle Price who found {{her way to}} the front {{followed}} closely by Nalanya and Australian Lora Storey. All five teams sorted themselves out into a string, with Poland's Anna Sabat the first to fall behind. After shadowing Price through most of the first leg, Nalanya slowed during the last 150 metres leaving Storey and Belarus' Darya Barysevich as the only chasers. Shortly after the first handoff, Chrishuna Williams broke away for the American team. That lead was temporary as Australian Abbey De La Motte and Belarus' Ilona Usovich not only pulled in the gap but went past Williams. De La Motte continued the momentum and put a gap on both of her pursuers handing off to Zoe Buckman with almost a 10-metre lead. Williams finally put on a strong kick finish to separate from Usovich, slightly pulling in De La Motte's big lead.|$|E
