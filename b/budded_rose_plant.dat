They were, he said, spoils of his wars under King Harry the Fifth and the two Lord Salisburys, which he had never had occasion to spend, and he desired that they might be laid out on the Lady Grisell in case of need, leaving her to think they were the dues from her faithful tenantry. To the Hausvrow Clemence it was a great grief to leave the peaceful home of her married life, and go among kindred who had shown their scorn in neglect and cold looks; but she kept a cheerful face for her husband, and only shed tears over the <b>budding</b> <b>roses</b> and other <b>plants</b> she had to leave; and she made her guest understand how great a comfort and solace was her company.|$|R

40|$|The {{search for}} active toxins for {{managing}} weeds or plant diseases {{is believed to}} be a promising avenue of investigation. However, the effects of Alternaria toxins on insects have just begun to be investigated. Bioactivities of toxins from four strains of Alternaria alternata on Rosa chinensis and rose aphid Macrosiphum rosivorum were tested in the present study. At a concentration of 50. 0 μg/ml, the crude extract (toxin) of strain 7484 was found not to be harmful to <b>rose</b> <b>plants</b> with excised leaf-puncture method (P≥ 0. 079), and <b>rose</b> <b>plants</b> showed enhanced resistance to rose aphids when this Alternaria toxin was sprayed on the plants (P≤ 0. 001). However, this toxin caused no detrimental effects on aphids in insecticidal bioassay at a concentration of 10. 0 to 160. 0 μg/ml (P≥ 0. 096). Therefore, the Alternaria toxin had significantly induced the resistance of <b>rose</b> <b>plants</b> against <b>rose</b> aphids, demonstrating that the resistance mechanism triggered by the Alternaria toxin in the <b>rose</b> <b>plant</b> may also be used by the plant to defend itself against insects. Further bioassays aimed to discover the olfactory responses of aphids to the toxin-induced volatiles of host plants. The aphids were significantly more attracted to both volatiles emitted and collected from control <b>rose</b> <b>plants</b> than to both volatiles emitted and collected from the toxin-treated <b>rose</b> <b>plants</b> (P≤ 0. 014). This result showed that the toxin-induced resistance related to the volatile changes of host plants...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{results on}} the {{biochemical}} constituents of rose inflorescence revealed that the levels of lipid, carbohydrate, nitrogen and protein were significantly lower (P< 0. 05) in infested parts when aphid population were maximum as compared to uninfested ones {{in most of the}} cases. The <b>rose</b> <b>plants</b> were mainly infested with two aphid species viz., Macrosiphumrosae (Linnaeus) and Macrosiphumrosaeiformis (Das). The infestation of insect pests caused considerable damage to the individualparts (leaf, stem and inflorescence) of the <b>rose</b> <b>plants</b> and significantly reduced the nutritional constituents at different growth stages. Macrosiphumrosae was found to be the most active pest of rose. These aphids have appeared in the fields especially with the onset of flowering. The loss in biochemical nutritives of plant foliage due to aphid infestation would degrade the quality of the products mainly made from the inflorescence of <b>rose</b> <b>plants.</b> This study reports results obtained from different localities, which may have almost similar ecological and environmental conditions.

5000|$|One {{case study}} of {{oxy-fuel}} combustion is the attempted White <b>Rose</b> <b>plant</b> in North Yorkshire, United Kingdom. The planned project was an oxy-fuel power plant coupled with air separation to capture two million tons of carbon dioxide per year.

However, in late 2015 and early 2016, following withdrawal of funding by the Drax Group and the U.K. government, construction was halted. The unforeseen loss of the federal CCS Commercialisation Programme, along with decreased subsidies for renewable energy, left the White <b>Rose</b> <b>Plant</b> with insufficient funds to continue development.|$|R
