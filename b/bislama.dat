The Land and Justice Party (in <b>Bislama,</b> Graon mo Jastis Pati (GJP)) aimed to facilitate young people's participation in politics. Regenvanu argued that the executive of existing parties was controlled by veteran politicians, inhibiting the rise of new, younger politicians. Regenvanu stated that a core objective of the party would be [...] "to try and put good leaders into parliament and into politics at all levels. And by that I mean leaders who are prepared to put the public interest first". In addition, the party would campaign on strengthening the guarantee of indigenous land ownership, and on promoting and facilitating indigenous participation in business.|$|E

The virtue of <b>Bislama</b> was that {{with a bit of}} determination you could pick it up in an afternoon. Campbell argued that, in certain respects, Macbeth in pidgin was better than the original. If nothing else, the campaign had the effect of bringing to a wider public the <b>Bislama</b> for Prince Philip: Nambawan bigfala emi blong Misis Kwin ("Number one big fellow him belong Mrs Queen").|$|E

50|$|More than 95% of <b>Bislama</b> {{words are}} of English origin; the {{remainder}} combines {{a few dozen}} words from French, {{as well as some}} vocabulary inherited from various languages of Vanuatu, essentially limited to flora and fauna terminology. While the influence of these vernacular languages is low on the vocabulary side, it is very high in the morphosyntax. <b>Bislama</b> can be basically described as a language with an English vocabulary and phonology and an Oceanic grammar.|$|E
50|$|This pidgin started {{spreading}} {{over the}} Vanuatu archipelago {{at the turn}} of the 20th century, as the survivors of blackbirding began to come back to their native islands: knowledge of this pidgin would facilitate communication not only with European traders and settlers, but also between native populations, and because Vanuatu is the most language-dense country in the world (one count puts it at 113 languages for a population of 225,000), <b>Bislama</b> usefully serves as a lingua franca for communication between ni-Vanuatu, as well as with and even between foreigners. Although it has been a spoken-only language for most of it's history, in 1995, has the first dictionary of <b>Bislama</b> been published. This, along with its second edition in 2004 has helped to create a uniform spelling of written <b>Bislama.</b>|$|E
