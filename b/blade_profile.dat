500|$|The CQC-7 {{is similar}} in size and <b>blade</b> <b>profile</b> to the CQC-6 with the main {{difference}} being a rear brake at {{the butt of the}} handle of the CQC-7 as opposed to the boattail shape of the CQC-6. After the contract with Benchmade expired, Emerson began production of this model in his own factory, Emerson Knives, Inc., in 1999. The production version of the CQC7 is not a handmade knife and features no bolsters or micarta in the handle construction. The handle material on the production model is G-10 fiberglass and the edge of the blade has a secondary bevel. There is a larger and smaller version of this knife known as the [...] "Super CQC-7" [...] and [...] "Mini-CQC-7", respectively and a version with a drop-point blade as opposed to a tanto. An [...] "all titanium" [...] handled version with a framelock was made in 2005 known as the HD-7 to commemorate the tenth anniversary of this model. Emerson makes handmade versions of the CQC-7 with variations similar to the CQC-6 mentioned above.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} rapid manufacture used {{in the development of}} a regenerative pump impeller. Rapid manufacturing technology was used to create complex impeller <b>blade</b> <b>profiles</b> for testing as part of a regenerative pump optimisation process. Regenerative pumps are the subject of increased interest in industry. Ten modified impeller <b>blade</b> <b>profiles,</b> from the standard radial configuration, were evaluated with the use of computational fluid dynamics and experimental testing. Prototype impellers were needed for experimental validation of the CFD results. The manufacture of the complex <b>blade</b> <b>profiles</b> using conventional milling techniques is a considerable challenge for skilled machinists. The complexity of the modified <b>blade</b> <b>profiles</b> would normally necessitate the use of expensive CNC machining with 5 axis capability. With an impeller less than 75 mm in diameter and a maximum blade thickness of 1. 3 mm, a rapid manufacturing technique enabled production of complex <b>blade</b> <b>profiles</b> that were dimensionally accurate and structurally robust enough for testing. As more advanced rapid prototyping machines become available in the study in the future, e. g. 3 D photopolymer jetting machine, the quality of the parts particularly in terms of surface finish will improve and the amount of post processing operations will reduce. This technique offers the possibility to produce components of increased complexity whilst ensuring quality, strength, performance and speed of manufacture. The ability to manufacture complex <b>blade</b> <b>profiles</b> that are robust enough for testing, in a rapid and cost effective manner is proving essential in the overall design optimisation process for the pump...|$|R

2500|$|During the 1950s, {{large numbers}} of folding switchblade or {{automatic}} opening knives with locking blades were imported from Italy to the United States. Most of these switchblades were side-opening designs, though some employed a telescoping blade. [...] These Italian switchblades were commonly and popularly referred to as stilettos, since most incorporated a long, slender blade tapering to a needle-like point, together with a slim-profile handle and vestigial cross-guard. [...] The majority of these Italian stiletto switchblade knives used a now-iconic bayonet-style blade with a single sabre-grind edge (often unsharpened) and a long opposing false edge. [...] As with the medieval stiletto, the stiletto switchblade was designed primarily as an offensive weapon, optimized for thrusting rather than cutting. [...] Most of these knives were designed with a locking device which locked the blade in the open position, and this lock, combined with the stiletto <b>blade</b> <b>profile,</b> enabled the knife {{to be used as}} an effective thrusting or stabbing weapon (unlike most U.S. switchblade designs of the day). [...] Though most switchblade stilettos used a single-edge blade equipped with a long false edge, many variations exist. [...] The stiletto switchblade is produced to this day in Italy and many other countries, and now includes many derivative folding knife designs that incorporate the same basic 'stiletto' or bayonet-style <b>blade</b> <b>profile,</b> including spring-assist, non-locking, and lock blade variants.|$|E
2500|$|While the V-42 had a {{double-edged}} blade {{similar to the}} Fairbairn–Sykes knife, the V-42 has a cross section with concave hollow ground blade facets, {{in contrast to the}} Fairbairn's flat four sided diamond cross section. The narrower V-42 stiletto <b>blade</b> <b>profile</b> was designed to optimize penetration on thrusting; it could easily penetrate a G.I. steel helmet and liner with a single thrust. [...] With its relatively thin, narrow blade, the V-42 was designed from the outset for use as a fighting knife, and was prone to breakage when used for utility chores such as opening ration tins or ammunition crates. [...] Unusually for military combat knives of the period, the V-42's twin edges were double hollow-ground for increased cutting performance. [...] The addition of the skull-crushing pommel was attributed to the input of Major Orval J. Baldwin, the FSSF Supply Officer. The thumb groove on the V-42's ricasso was designed to promote a flat grip with the thumb over the crossguard, which positioned the double-edged blade horizontally. [...] In this manner a user could slash an opponent with either a forehand or backhand stroke, while ensuring that his blade would slip between the ribs when used in a thrust or stab.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{fabricate}} very large objects of arbitrarily complexity from various high density polymers, a hybrid {{approach has been}} developed in which layers are individually machined and then stacked together. The layers are obtained by moving a heated cutter blade along {{the periphery of the}} layer. The adjustable tool is held by a controllable gripper and manipulated by a sculpturing robot. During motion the shape of the blade is continuously adapted to the target geometry for the layer. Thus extremely thick layers are obtained, compared to conventional techniques. The synchronous control of the shape of the cutter blade is a multilevel optimization problem, involving 1) finding the shape of the blade that suffices to the minimum energy principle, 2) minimizing the deviation between shape curves on the layer and the <b>blades</b> <b>profile</b> curve, 3) finding the best fitting region of the <b>blades</b> <b>profile</b> curve for various curvature characteristics, 4) finding the best tool positions and the optimum tool path.
