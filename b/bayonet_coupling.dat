2500|$|Mechanical or {{biological}} (bioprostheses or [...] "tissue valves"), the replaceable models of implantable heart valve prostheses {{are made by}} two or three mechanical components. The gear attachment mechanism usually uses the coil effect or the <b>bayonet</b> <b>coupling</b> system.|$|E
5000|$|Similar {{connectors}} {{with different}} contact arrangements and <b>bayonet</b> <b>coupling</b> rings {{are also available}} to military specifications. [...] Supplemental military specifications (e.g., MS Drawings, Detail Specifications, and Performance Specifications) are available to assist users with the proper selection of connectors and related components.|$|E
50|$|Van-System s.r.l Manufactures {{a line of}} {{circular}} electrical connectors {{for professional}} use {{in a wide range}} of fields: railways (in rolling stock as well as signalling applications), machine tools, automation, construction sites, research, power supply, extractive industries, plant engineering etc. Besides connectors with screw or <b>bayonet</b> <b>coupling</b> complying with the Mil-C-5015 standard, non-standard products for special applications are also designed and manufactured.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the training the Cyclists had received {{under the direction of}} the Corps of Guides in Canada, a much more intensive course was started in England which consisted of musketry, bombing, and <b>bayonet</b> fighting <b>coupled</b> with the highly specialized role of learning signalling and topography techniques, range-finding, tactics and the use of Lewis guns.|$|R
5000|$|The L85 is {{supplied}} with a sling, blank-firing adaptor, cleaning kit and a blade-type <b>bayonet,</b> which <b>coupled</b> with the sheath can {{double as a}} wire cutter (the sheath contains a small saw and sharpening stone). The rifle {{can be adapted to}} use [...]22 Long Rifle training ammunition with a special conversion kit. The Small Arms Weapons Effects Simulator can be used on the L85 when in training with blank ammunition. The rifle variant also accommodates a 40 mm under-barrel grenade launcher such as Heckler & Koch AG-36 40 mm grenade launcher variants.|$|R
50|$|Although {{starting}} cranks {{had been}} replaced by electric starters for decades, Ford cars included a manual starting feature until 1948 as an antidote to dead-battery syndrome. The wheel-lug wrench served as a handle (also for the jack) and the jack shaft with bayonet-coupling pins could be inserted through a small hole in the grille to engage a bayonet socket on the forward end of the engine crankshaft. A quick-and-easy twist of the handle was sufficient to start the flat head V8, and the <b>bayonet</b> <b>coupling</b> was self-disengaging for safety.|$|E
40|$|A cryopumping module using {{metallic}} surfaces at liquid helium {{temperature for}} condensation of hydrogen and deuterium gas has been constructed. This pump, {{a prototype of}} four units which will provide pumping for the Livermore 200 kV test stand, {{will be used to}} verify the concept and establish engineering parameters. Upon completion of engineering tests and evaluation the pump will be installed in an operating beam line. The design point pumping capacity is 80, 000 liters per second for hydrogen and deuterium at 10 $sup - 4 $ torr based on sticking coefficients of 0. 15 and 0. 25, respectively. Both the liquid helium temperature pumping surface and the liquid nitrogen temperature radiation shields are constructed of quilted double wall cylindrical shells. The pumping shell dimensions are 1. 5 meters dia. x 0. 6 meters long. Cryogen circulation is convection current driven in both cases. Liquid helium is supplied from an overhead Dewar through <b>bayonet</b> <b>coupling.</b> In the 200 kV beam line, pumping modules will be supplied via transfer lines from a central Dewar. Voltage standoff will be accomplished in the transfer lines. (auth...|$|E
