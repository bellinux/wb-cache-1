But I do remember hearing them. I remember the weird cadence of their song in the dark distance; I remember the brittle sound of the camel's hooves crushing the frozen snow; and I remember the mysterious tinkling of their silver bridles.|$|E
500|$|Considering what to write, Carrier {{thought of}} his own childhood. He stated in an {{interview}} that he began thinking of [...] "when was it that I felt I was really myself? And I remember it was when I put on my skates and my Eaton catalogues on my legs, and I stood up, and I was taller than my mom, and I had a stick in my hands, so I was stronger than my <b>brother,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> felt that I was little me. So I started to write about that and it turned into the Hockey Sweater story." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a preview}} of the record, Jeff Benjamin from Fuse {{acknowledged}} the 1980s influences that resonated throughout the track and noted that [...] "hard rock guitars and percussion come crashing in on the chorus." [...] Sarah O' Hara, while reviewing Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams for Lowdown, compared the song to [...] "Kings and Queens", a track with a similar structure included on This Is War featuring sparse verses and slow atmospheric builds to the chorus. In an interview with Loudwire, Leto described [...] "City of Angels" [...] as a very personal song about a specific place. He said, [...] "It's the story of my <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> going to Los Angeles to make our dreams come true. It's a love letter to that beautiful and bizarre land." [...] Leto later explained that the song could refer to any place a person goes to fulfill his or her own dreams. Mary Ouellette, writing for Loudwire, felt that the song [...] "tells a passionate tale of finding comfort in calling the city of Los Angeles home." ...|$|E

Her mother, Elvira, is a physics teacher who runs a pharmacy, and her father, Mark Kunis, is a {{mechanical}} engineer {{who works as a}} cab driver. Kunis has an elder brother named Michael. Her mother tongue and the common language within her family is Russian. She stated in 2011 that her parents had [...] "amazing jobs", and that she [...] "was very lucky" [...] and the family was [...] "not poor"; they had decided to leave the USSR because they saw [...] "no future" [...] there for Mila and her brother. In 1991, when she was seven years old, her family moved to Los Angeles, California, with $250. [...] "That was all we were allowed to take with us. My parents had given up good jobs and degrees, which were not transferable. We arrived in New York on a Wednesday and by Friday morning my <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> were at school in LA." ...|$|E
500|$|During a 2001 {{interview}} with Gary Graff from Wall of Sound Magazine, Maida recounted {{the inspiration for}} the lyrics of [...] "Are You Sad". He was in New York recording [...] "In Repair" [...] at the old Hit Factory studio, which was later known as Avatar Studios. Following those sessions, Maida attempted to call his younger brother from his hotel room but couldn't get through. [...] "When you're making a record, you kind of go into hiding, especially when I'm writing lyrics or writing music; I tend not {{to keep in touch with}} any friends or family or stuff. But my <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have a good relationship, and I want to keep it good. I couldn't get a hold of him for, like, a week, and I knew he was going through a shitty time — typical young-20s, no job, having a tough life. I wanted to talk to him desperately, and this song just came out of me, [...] "Are You Sad?" [...] It came out really quickly on a shitty travel guitar". The meaning of [...] "If You Believe" [...] was revealed in a 2001 {{interview with}} Cleveland.com, [...] "That song's about having an out-of-body experience and seeing that the afterlife is real," [...] Maida confirms, [...] "and telling people that there's something machines can't have, and we've got it.|$|E
500|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{started in}} 1998 in Los Angeles, California, as a {{collaboration}} between brothers Jared Leto and Shannon Leto, who had been playing music together since their childhood. The duo later expanded to a four-piece when they added guitarist Solon Bixler and bassist Matt Wachter to the line-up. Additional guitarist Kevin Drake, who first auditioned for the position of bassist, also joined the band as a touring musician. The band played its first concerts under different names, before finally settling on the name [...] "Thirty Seconds to Mars", which was taken from a rare manuscript titled Argus Apocraphex. Jared Leto spoke of the name as [...] "a reference, a rough translation from the book. I think the idea is interesting, it's {{a metaphor for the}} future," [...] he explained. [...] "Thirty seconds to Mars—the fact that we're so close to something that's not a tangible idea. Also Mars being the God of War makes it really interesting, as well. You could substitute that in there, but what's important for my <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> is that it be imaginative and really represent the sound of our music in as unique a way as possible." [...] He described it as a name that [...] "works on several different levels, a phrase that is lyrical, suggestive, cinematic, and filled with immediacy." [...] When Thirty Seconds to Mars first started, Jared Leto did not allow his vocation as a Hollywood actor to be used in promotion of the band.|$|E

2500|$|On a {{separate}} issue, physician and conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer has criticized {{what he sees}} as a naive focus on living wills by the policymakers over other types of medical advice. He has written: [...] "When my father was dying, my mother and <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had to decide how much treatment to pursue. What was a better way to ascertain my father's wishes: What he checked off on a form... or what we, who had known him intimately for decades, thought he would want?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{accidental}} {{death of her}} only brother, Michael (1911–1932), made Carte the heir to her father's hotel and theatre interests. [...] As a child, however, she had been reluctant to assume the family legacy. [...] She later told The Gramophone magazine: [...] "At home, you know, we weren't allowed to hum Gilbert and Sullivan; in fact we were fined for it, because it annoyed my father. We were allowed to sing it properly, but my <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> couldn't – in my family the fact that I wasn't Mozart at about three years old was thought of as rather disappointing. So I went through a phase when I was very anti-Gilbert and Sullivan; I became rather a highbrow, and my father thought I {{was a bit of}} a snake-in-the-grass because of it." ...|$|E
