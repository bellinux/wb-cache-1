5|$|After the Spring Street {{intersection}} {{another two}} blocks past the courthouse, Main Street curves to the south, narrowing in the process. It {{is now a}} two-lane road. Two <b>blocks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south, SH 82 turns east again to follow East Cooper Avenue, crossing the Roaring Fork again after another two blocks. The highway curves southward, leaving Aspen three-quarters of a mile (1.1km) further east.|$|E
5|$|Off the {{expressway}} and now at-grade, NY47 turned north onto NY383, {{forming a}} short concurrency with NY383 into Rochester. At Elmwood Avenue, NY47 and NY383 departed Scottsville Road and proceeded eastward on Elmwood Avenue. Two <b>blocks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east, at an intersection with South Plymouth Avenue, NY383 split from NY47, following Plymouth Avenue into downtown Rochester. NY47 remained routed on Elmwood Avenue, crossing the Genesee River and passing north of Strong Memorial Hospital prior to intersecting NY15 (Mount Hope Avenue) {{in the shadow}} of Mount Hope Cemetery. East of NY15, NY47 progressed along Elmwood Avenue, intersecting several local streets before entering Brighton.|$|E

5|$|Omaha is {{laid out}} on a grid plan, with 12 <b>blocks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mile with a north-to-south house {{numbering}} system. Omaha is {{the location of a}} historic boulevard system designed by H.W.S. Cleveland who sought to combine the beauty of parks with the pleasure of driving cars. The historic Florence and Fontenelle Boulevards, as well as the modern Sorenson Parkway, are important elements in this system.|$|E
5|$|Ownership of the {{continuous}} park blocks {{was not without}} dispute, however. After Lownsdale died without a will, and then his wife Nancy died, his estate challenged that his plat didn't require the central section to be dedicated to public use since Nancy had not signed over legal title to the land. The courts agreed in 1865. Benjamin Stark reneged on the donation of two north central park <b>blocks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city, instead offering to sell them for $138,000. Captain John H. Couch deeded his section, which became the North Park <b>Blocks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city on January 25, 1865, only ten days after receiving the federal patent for the land. Six of the South Park Blocks were lost to private parties in the 1870s, and elected city officials were unwilling to spend the asking price of $6,000 per block to purchase them so soon after the city had bought the land for Washington Park. Only a year later, a proposal to acquire the six blocks for $92,000 was brought by the city council, showing the increase in prices in that year.|$|E
5|$|The {{naming rights}} of the space belong to Wm. Wrigley Jr, the {{foundation}} that created the world’s famous chewing gum. Wrigley Company officials, including William Wrigley, Jr. II, wanted to contribute to Millennium Park, and the historic aspect of the peristyle was attractive to them partly because the original peristyle was constructed {{around the same time}} as the Wrigley Building, the corporate headquarters located a few <b>blocks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, and because the classical architectural styles of both are similar.|$|E

5|$|The route follows Eighteen Mile Creek {{northwest}} and west toward {{the village of}} Hamburg, where the amount of development along the highway increases significantly. At McKinley Parkway (County Route204), NY391 becomes East Main Street and begins {{to pass through the}} outskirts of the village. It officially enters Hamburg upon intersecting Sunnyside Drive two <b>blocks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west. The route continues into the village center, passing by commercial and residential buildings on its way to a roundabout at Buffalo Street, where it meets US62. At this point, NY391 comes to an end while US62 turns west onto Main Street from Buffalo Street.|$|E

5|$|At Main Street, Church Street splits {{into a pair}} of one-way {{streets and}} becomes North and South Division Street. The route follows South Division eastward for two blocks to an {{intersection}} with Ellicott Street located one block north of Coca-Cola Field. At the junction, which includes the northern terminus of NY16, NY5 turns northward, rejoining NY5 westbound one block later at North Division. The route continues on Ellicott for nine <b>blocks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unidirectional East Tupper Street, where NY5 westbound separates from the route once more. NY5 eastbound, however, continues north on Ellicott for an additional block to the one-way Goodell Street. NY5 heads west on Goodell for two blocks before turning north onto Main Street, rejoining NY5 westbound at the intersection.|$|E
50|$|Northumberland sits {{above the}} Iapetus Suture, the line along which the former Iapetus Ocean closed during the Palaeozoic, thereby causing the Caledonian Orogeny.

50|$|The old {{manor house}} was {{replaced}} in 1727-29 by William Lacon Childe (died 1756). He commissioned architect Francis Smith of Warwick <b>to</b> create <b>the</b> present Palladian style mansion. The brick-built, east-facing, three-storey, seven-bayed central block {{is flanked by}} single-storey wings and two smaller detached two-storey blocks; <b>the</b> <b>block</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north originally housed stables and <b>the</b> <b>block</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south the kitchens.|$|R
5|$|In February 1976, Koubek {{contributed a}} third {{high-rise}} office building to Farragut Square, {{this one a}} brick-and-solarized glass structure with a glass-and-aluminum penthouse at 818 Connecticut Avenue NW. His massive, grid-like 400 North Capitol Street, {{one of the few}} office buildings he designed with a plaza between two wings, opened in June. His 12-story International Square building—with its inverted setbacks above the Farragut West Washington Metro station, ninth-floor balcony with non-structural columns, interior atrium, and ground level set-back retail concourse—opened in November. Originally just a single office building on a corner for a city block, it expanded to occupy nearly the entire block with the addition of two almost identical towers in 1979 and 1980. (The atrium was upgraded and a fountain added in 1992.) Two <b>blocks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, in April 1977 Koubek also designed a fairly nondescript office building at 1990 K Street NW.|$|E
5|$|Midway between Fulton and the Minetto {{hamlet of}} the same name, NY48 serves Battle Island State Park, named for a small island in the Oswego River a short {{distance}} to the north. NY48 presses onward {{along the edge of}} the Oswego to the hamlet of Minetto, where it intersects CR24, formerly NY48A. North of the hamlet, NY48 passes by the Oswego Country Club as it enters the Oswego city limits. Once in the City of Oswego, NY48 becomes West First Street. At Utica Street, NY48 briefly turns west before turning back north at West Fifth Street and terminating at NY104 (Bridge Street). West First Street continues north for an additional six <b>blocks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Lake Ontario shoreline. NY48 is city-maintained within the cities of Fulton and Oswego; the rest of the highway is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT).|$|E
5|$|One block {{north of}} CR100, Caleb's Path forks {{off to the}} {{northwest}} while NY111 splits to the northeast along Joshua's Path, serving {{a long stretch of}} homes {{in the northern part of}} Central Islip. Several <b>blocks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, NY111 intersects with CR67 (Long Island Motor Parkway) at an at-grade intersection on the northern edge of the community. Now out of Central Islip, the route traverses industrialized areas surrounding a large Y intersection with CR17 (Wheeler Road) in Hauppauge. NY111 takes on the Wheeler Road name, and the route immediately enters an interchange (exit56) with the Long Island Expressway (I-495). From here, the route bends northeast along Wheeler Road, paralleling the Nissequogue River as it serves the northern part of the town of Islip.|$|E

5|$|SR15 {{ends at the}} Michigan {{state line}} just north of Pioneer, Ohio, where it becomes M-99. The roadway travels northward from the state line on Pioneer Road, through mostly {{agricultural}} areas of Hillsdale County before reaching a junction with M-34 just west of Osseo. The trunkline turns westward on Hudson Road, which curves to the north around Baw Beese Lake just southeast of Hillsdale. M-99 passes through Hillsdale on a northwest course on Broad Street and Carlton Road, passing just a few <b>blocks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west of Hillsdale College. After leaving town, the road bends to the north as Olds Street as it runs parallel to the St. Joseph River to Jonesville. In that community, M-99 intersects US12. The two highways run concurrently through Jonesville for {{less than half a}} mile (0.8km) before M-99 returns to its northwesterly course. It leaves the town toward Litchfield continuing parallel to the river.|$|E
5|$|State {{maintenance}} ends {{just after}} the Jefferson Boulevard interchange, and the road — now maintained {{by the city of}} West Sacramento as Tower Bridge Gateway — crosses the new Garden Street at an at-grade intersection. This intersection replaced a partial trumpet interchange, oriented towards West Capitol Avenue with a missing westbound entrance, in 2007. After Tower Bridge Gateway crosses under the Union Pacific Railroad line that used to cross the Tower Bridge, it approaches an intersection with 5th Street. It was formerly a ramp that entered the westbound lanes from the intersection of West Capitol Avenue and 5th Street, which completed the former interchange at Riske Lane. Two <b>blocks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east, Tower Bridge Gateway approaches its final intersection in West Sacramento with 3rd Street. A westbound offramp formerly lead to West Capitol Avenue and 3rd Street, with eastbound access to Broderick to the north and the formerly industrial area to the south, now containing Raley Field.|$|E

5|$|The homes cease {{temporarily}} around NY598's intersection with NY290 (James Street), {{a prominent}} retail corridor in eastern Syracuse. Upon crossing NY290, NY598 becomes North Midler Avenue {{as it becomes}} surrounded by houses once more. At the Syracuse city line three <b>blocks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, North Midler Avenue splits off to the northeast while NY598 becomes New Court Avenue. The switch in both the town of DeWitt and name also brings about a switch in surroundings as the route heads northwest into a heavily industrial area built up along CSX's Mohawk Subdivision rail line. NY598 ends shortly afterward at an intersection with NY298 just inside the Salina town line. The portion of NY598 in DeWitt and Salina is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT); {{the remainder of the}} route is maintained by the city of Syracuse.|$|E
5|$|Business US Highway23 (Bus. US23) is a {{business}} loop that runs through downtown Rogers City on two-lane streets. The highway starts at an intersection with US23 in Belknap Township south of downtown and passes the location of Michigan Limestone and Chemical Company's quarry on Petersville Road, the largest such quarry in the world. Farther north, the business loop passes {{the eastern end of}} the Rogers City Airport and turns northwesterly, parallel to, but inland from, the Lake Huron shoreline. Now following 3rd Street, Bus. US23 runs through a residential area on the southern side of town before entering downtown. At the intersection with Erie Street, Bus. US23 meets the eastern terminus of M-68. Four blocks later, the business loop comes the closest to Lake Huron in another residential area before turning to the west. Anorther five <b>blocks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west of this curve, Bus. US23 terminates at an intersection with US23 on {{the western edge of the}} city. The business route carries the section of the Lake Huron Circle Tour (LHCT) through Rogers City.|$|E
5|$|When the Illinois and Michigan Canal {{opened in}} 1848, the landmass at Wolf Point was {{decreased}} by dredging {{to accommodate a}} turning basin for ships. In the autumn {{of the same year}} the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad opened Chicago's first railroad depot at Wolf Point, on the southwestern corner of Kinzie and Canal Streets. By 1857 the site of Wolf Point Tavern was being used as a lumber yard; the Fulton Elevator, one of Chicago's earliest grain elevators, was built just {{to the north of the}} former tavern in 1852. Several <b>blocks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west of Wolf Point were destroyed in a large fire on September 15, 1859. The Fulton Elevator survived this, and the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, but was burned down on September 7, 1873. It was rebuilt in the same year, and another grain elevator, the St Paul Elevator, was added immediately to the south of the original in 1879. The Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railway company purchased both elevators in 1889 for $400,000 ($ million today), but demolished them in 1906. Currently, the site is occupied by the Riverbend Condominiums at 333 North Canal Street.|$|E
