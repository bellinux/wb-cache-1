5|$|The 747 has {{redundant}} structures {{along with}} four redundant hydraulic systems and four main landing gears with four wheels each, which {{provide a good}} spread of support {{on the ground and}} safety in case of tire <b>blow-outs.</b> The main gear are redundant so that landing can be performed on two opposing landing gears if the others do not function properly. In addition, the 747 has split control surfaces and was designed with sophisticated triple-slotted flaps that minimize landing speeds and allow the 747 to use standard-length runways. For transportation of spare engines, 747s can accommodate a non-functioning fifth-pod engine under the port wing of the aircraft between the inner functioning engine and the fuselage.|$|E

These {{were compared with}} <b>blow-out</b> velocities for JP- 4, propylene oxide, and neohexane and previously reported data for JP- 4 solutions of pentaborane. For those reaction products investigated, the <b>blow-out</b> velocities at a fixed equivalence ratio were higher for those materials containing higher boron concentrations; that is, <b>blow-out</b> velocity increased in the following order: (1) methylacetylene - diborane, (2) acetylene - diborane, and (3) ethylene - decaborane reaction products...|$|R
40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{simulations}} and {{in particular}} Large Eddy Simulations (LES) have been proposed {{as a way to}} predict the highly transient lean <b>blow-out</b> process characteristic of modern augmentors. Quantitative predictions of the lean <b>blow-out</b> event strongly relies on the ability to accurately model the kinetics of the flame stabilized {{in the wake of the}} flameholder. In this paper, the effect of grid size on lean <b>blow-out</b> predictions is investigated. It is shown that the lack of resolution of the flame leads to enhanced reaction rate and flame speed, and therefore under-estimation of the equivalence ratio at <b>blow-out.</b> An approach relying on grid-dependent combustion kinetics is proposed to improve predictions Nomenclature A = pre-exponential Ba = aerodynamic blockage L = length of recirculation zone P = pressure Re = Reynolds number SL = laminar flame speed T = Temperature UBO = <b>blow-out</b> velocity w = aerodynamic wake width α = thermal diffusivity ∆x = grid size Φ = equivalence ratio τ = residence time I...|$|R

40|$|<b>Blow-out</b> {{limits of}} nonpremixed {{turbulent}} jet flames in quiescent air at sub-atmospheric pressures (50 – 100 kPa) were studied experimentally using propane fuel with nozzle diameters ranging 0. 8 – 4 mm. Results {{showed that the}} fuel jet velocity at <b>blow-out</b> limit increased with increasing ambient pressure and nozzle diameter. A Damköhler (Da) number based model was adopted, defined as the ratio of characteristic mixing time and characteristic reaction time, to include the effect of pressure considering the variations in laminar burning velocity and thermal diffusivity with pressure. The critical lift-off height at <b>blow-out,</b> representing a characteristic length scale for mixing, had a linear relationship with the theoretically predicted stoichiometric location along the jet axis, which had a weak dependence on ambient pressure. The characteristic mixing time (critical lift-off height divided by jet velocity) adjusted to the characteristic reaction time such that the critical Damköhler at <b>blow-out</b> conditions maintained a constant value when varying the ambient pressure...|$|R
