5000|$|The {{alternative}} concept, {{developed in}} {{roughly the same}} time frame was closed-circuit scuba. The body consumes and metabolises {{only a small fraction}} of inhaled oxygen—the situation is even more wasteful of oxygen when the breathing gas is compressed as it is in ambient pressure breathing systems underwater. The rebreather recycles the exhaled breathing gas, while constantly replenishing it from the supply so that the oxygen level does not get depleted. The apparatus also has to remove the exhaled carbon dioxide, as a buildup of CO2 levels would result in respiratory distress and hypercapnia. The first commercially practical scuba rebreather was designed and built by the diving engineer Henry Fleuss in 1878, while working for Siebe Gorman in London. His self contained breathing apparatus consisted of a rubber mask connected to a breathing bag, with (estimated) 50-60% O2 supplied from a copper tank and CO2 scrubbed by rope yarn soaked in a solution of caustic potash; the system giving a duration of about three hours. This apparatus was first used under operational conditions in 1880 by the lead diver on the Severn Tunnel construction project, who was able to travel 1000 ft in the darkness to close several submerged sluice doors in the tunnel; this had defeated the best efforts of hard hat divers due to the danger of their air supply hoses becoming fouled on submerged debris, and the strong water currents in the workings. Fleuss continually improved his apparatus, adding a demand regulator and tanks capable of holding greater amounts of oxygen at higher pressure. Sir Robert Davis, head of Siebe Gorman, improved the oxygen rebreather in 1910 with his invention of the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus, the first rebreather to be made in quantity. While intended primarily as an emergency escape apparatus for submarine crews, it was soon also used for diving, being a handy shallow water diving apparatus with a thirty-minute endurance, and as an industrial breathing set. The rig comprised a rubber breathing/buoyancy bag containing a canister of barium hydroxide to scrub exhaled CO2 and, in a pocket at the lower end of the bag, a steel pressure cylinder holding approximately 56 L of oxygen at a pressure of [...] which was equipped with a control valve and connected to the breathing <b>bag.</b> <b>Opening</b> the cylinder's valve admitted oxygen to the bag at ambient pressure. The rig also included an emergency buoyancy bag on the front of to help keep the wearer afloat. The DSEA was adopted by the Royal Navy after further development by Davis in 1927. During the 1930s and all through World War II, the British, Italians and Germans developed and extensively used oxygen rebreathers to equip the first frogmen. The British adapted the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus and the Germans adapted the Dräger submarine escape rebreathers, for their frogmen during the war. The Italians developed similar rebreathers for the combat swimmers of the Decima Flottiglia MAS, especially the Pirelli ARO. In the U.S. Major Christian J. Lambertsen invented an underwater free-swimming oxygen rebreather in 1939, which was accepted by the Office of Strategic Services. In 1952 he patented a modification of his apparatus, this time named SCUBA, which became the generic English word for autonomous breathing equipment for diving. After World War II, military frogmen continued to use rebreathers since they do not make bubbles which would give away the presence of the divers. The high percentage of oxygen used by these early rebreather systems limited the depth at which they could be used.|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science InstituteRandall K. PhebusDue to the {{potential}} of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) contamination, beef processors use various antimicrobial interventions throughout the slaughter and fabrication processes to reduce risks of contaminating the food supply. Certain antimicrobials are approved and marketed for spraying onto chilled subprimal cuts; however, administering these treatments through commercial-scale equipment against foodborne pathogens is not fully validated. This study evaluated the efficacy of three common antimicrobial sprays, individually (Study 1) and combined (Study 2), against a rifampicin-resistant STEC cocktail (O 26, O 45, O 103, O 111, O 121, O 145, and O 157 :H 7) using a commercial style subprimal spray cabinet. For Study 1, beef subprimals (n= 16) were mist-inoculated with the cocktail (ca. 5 log CFU/cm²), followed by spray-treatment with individual antimicrobials [200 ppm peracetic acid (PAA), 2 % Centron™ (sulfuric acid, sodium sulfate anhydrous and water mixture; CEN), 4. 5 % lactic acid (LA), or water (W) ]. Study 1 was designed as randomized generalized block. After each treatment phase, STEC population reductions were quantified. As individual antimicrobial treatments, LA and PAA provided greater (P ≤ 0. 05) STEC reductions (0. 5 and 0. 6 ± 0. 08 log CFU/cm², respectively) compared to water (0. 2 ± 0. 08 log CFU/cm²), but the CEN reduction (0. 4 ± 0. 10 log CFU/cm²) was statistically similar to W. To test the efficacy of combined treatments on subprimal cuts in Study 2, a split-plot design was used using three replications. The inoculated subprimals (n= 4) were first treated with PAA, LA, CEN, or W; vacuum packaged; and stored for 72 hours at 4 °C. Each subprimal was then divided (n= 16) and treated {{with each of the}} four antimicrobials as a second treatment. Cumulative reductions from the two treatments and storage ranged from 0. 5 to 1. 5 log CFU/cm² (± 0. 3 log CFU/cm²); the greatest reduction was observed when subprimals were treated with LA followed by vacuum packaged storage and another LA application. Nevertheless, there was no statistical significance among treatments for a particular combination of treatments in Study 2. These studies indicate that the individual antimicrobial treatments evaluated are marginally effective for reducing STEC populations on chilled beef subprimal cuts during fabrication. Although there {{does not seem to be}} a specific combination of treatment that is more effective than another, the overall bacterial reduction may be improved by combining treatments when the beef is stored under vacuum packaged conditions and retreated upon <b>bag</b> <b>opening,</b> as typical of mechanical tenderization operations...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to improve}} the {{understanding}} of the factors that determine the performance of baghouses used for milk powder collection. The research focuses specifically on the similarities and differences between milk powder collection and other common baghouse applications. The thesis also aims to demonstrate the value of recent developments in computational fluid dynamics in developing predictive models of baghouse performance. It is hoped that the findings of the thesis may find application in the New Zealand dairy industry, where such baghouses are commonly used to collect milk powder after spray drying. The effect of operating temperature and humidity on the performance of baghouses was investigated by examining both the forward filtration process and pulse cleaning process. Forward filtration was examined in a series of bench scale experiments, then scaled up to the pilot scale to confirm the findings. The effect of humidity on the pulsing performance was then investigated at the pilot scale. The importance of pulse system design was investigated at the pilot scale in a separate set of experiments. Pulse nozzle position, pulse pressure, and pulse duration were varied and the effect on the baghouse pressure differentials was measured. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) filter model designed for membrane filtration was adapted with some success to simulate a milk powder baghouse. The model was successful in predicting the length of the low pressure zone {{at the top of the}} bag, and the general trends in overpressure associated with changes to the pulse system geometry. The model was not successful in predicting the acceleration of the filter bag during the pulse. The model was used to simulate both forward filtration and pulsing, to extend the results of the experimental investigation. The effects of changes in the pulse nozzle height, pulse nozzle diameter, and pulse pressure were simulated, as well as the effect of gravitational settling during forward filtration, to extend the results of the previous experiments. There is a clear opportunity remaining for further work to extend the basic model developed here and to adapt the model to simulate large industrial baghouses. Experiments on the bench scale and pilot scale indicated that increased cohesive forces between particles improve the performance of milk powder baghouses by lowering the resistance of the filter cake during forward filtration and aiding cake removal during pulse cleaning. Under the conditions typical of industrial milk powder baghouses, cohesive forces are governed primarily by liquid bridging between particles, due to melted fat (particularly at high temperatures) and softened lactose (at high humidity levels). As a range of milk powders with different compositions are produced commercially, the relative importance of lactose-based and fat-based cohesion differs between powder types. Cohesion promotes the formation of porous structures in the filter cake, improving the cake permeability. In skim milk powder (SMP), particle cohesion is dominated by softened lactose, and is highly moisture dependent. In the bench scale experiments conducted here, increasing the relative humidity from 6 % to 17 % decreased the specific cake resistance from 1. 69 x 10 ⁹ m. kg¯¹ to 8. 23 X 10 ⁸ m. kg¯¹, and decreased the proportion of powder adhering to the filter from 14 % of the total supplied powder to 3 %. The combination of these effects decreased the total resistance over the filter from 1. 09 X 10 ⁹m¯¹ to 1. 89 X 10 ⁸; m¯¹, an 83 % reduction. The low deposition at high humidity suggested that the porous cake structure formed at high humidity levels was fragile, so that deposited particles were prone to subsequent dislodgement, especially in areas where the shear velocity near the filter surface was high. In pilot scale experiments, the porous cake structure formed at high humidity was more easily removed from the filter bag, resulting in more effective pulse cleaning. It was concluded that particle cohesion promoted cake filtration over depth filtration, as particles tended to adhere to the cake surface immediately upon contact. As depth filtered particles are more difficult to remove, the shift toward cake filtration at high humidity improved the pulse cleaning performance. A high-fat milk protein concentrate (MPC) powder was also filtered on the bench scale apparatus. Particle cohesion in the MPC powder was dominated by liquid fat, and showed a clear dependence on temperature but not on humidity. Increasing the temperature from 30 °C to 90 °C caused the specific cake resistance of the MPC to decrease from 1. 06 x 10 ⁸ m⁻¹ to 3. 94 x 10 ⁷m⁻¹, a 63 % decrease. The deposition of MPC powder was unaffected by either temperature or humidity. Gravitational settling of particles in large baghouses was found to produce significant variations in the properties of the filter cake throughout the baghouse. Experimental results with the pilot scale baghouse found a strong decreasing trend in the particle size with increasing height in the baghouse, with the mean particle size decreasing from 117 μm at the bottom of the baghouse to only 31 μm near the top of the filter bag. The filter cake thickness also decreased sharply with height. Results from the CFD simulations indicated that in the pilot scale baghouse particles larger than 120 μm in diameter tend to fall out of the air flow and collect in the bottom of the baghouse, instead of depositing on the filter. While industrial baghouses tend to have a higher elutriation velocity than the pilot scale baghouse used in this study, the large size of industrial baghouses provides ample opportunity for particles to segregate on the basis of size. In addition, bench scale results indicated that high air velocities near the filter surface may cause particles to rebound from the filter. This may occur in industrial baghouses in the region near the inlet, where the air velocity is highest. The reverse pressure differential induced in the filter bag by a cleaning pulse was found to increase with distance from the cell plate. Positioning the nozzle too close to the <b>bag</b> <b>opening</b> created a low pressure zone just beneath the cell plate, where the pressure remained lower inside the bag than outside throughout the pulse. This may lead to poor cleaning at the top of the bag. In the pilot scale baghouse, positioning the nozzle at least 0. 7 m from the <b>bag</b> <b>opening</b> eliminated the low pressure zone. The optimum distance of 0. 7 m is is dependent on the nozzle type and bag diameter, but can be directly applied to recent industrial baghouse designs in the NZ dairy industry, which have the same nozzle type and bag diameter as the pilot scale baghouse. The design of the pulse cleaning system is important in achieving good baghouse performance. Increasing the pulse tank pressure on the pilot scale baghouse from 3. 5 bar to 6. 5 bar caused a 30 % reduction in the forward pressure differential after the pulse, while decreasing the pulse pressure below 3. 5 bar caused the pressure differentials to increase indefinitely. Altering the nozzle position had no effect on the overall pressure differentials, but did alter the local acceleration at different points on the filter bag during a pulse. CFD simulations indicated that decreasing the distance between the nozzle and the <b>bag</b> <b>opening</b> from 0. 7 m to 0. 1 m increased the overpressure at the bottom of the bag from 770 Pa to 3500 Pa, but this was offset by the appearance of the low pressure zone at the top of the bag as mentioned above. CFD simulations indicated that the diameter of the pulse nozzle altered both the mean bag overpressure generated by the pulse, and the distribution of the overpressure over the bag surface, with the low pressure zone at the top of the bag becoming longer at large nozzle diameters. The pulse duration was found to be unimportant, with experiments on the pilot scale baghouse finding that this had no effect on either the overall baghouse pressure differentials or the length of the low pressure zone at the top of the bag. The project has extended the understanding of milk powder baghouse performance by relating the moisture-dependent properties of lactose and the temperature-dependent melting of dairy fats to baghouse performance. The project has also provided a useful design tool in the form of the CFD model. The project demonstrates an opportunity for further CFD research into baghouse design, as the basic model developed here could now be modified to directly simulate large industrial baghouses. It is hoped that the results from this thesis will find application in the New Zealand Dairy Industry...|$|E

50|$|In 1952 the United States {{military}} {{developed a}} portable solar still for pilots stranded on the ocean, which comprises an inflatable 24-inch plastic ball that floats on the ocean, with a flexible tube coming out the side. A separate plastic bag hangs from attachment {{points on the}} outer bag. Seawater is poured into the inner <b>bag</b> from an <b>opening</b> in the ball's neck. Fresh water is taken out by the pilot using the side tube that leads to bottom of the inflatable ball. It was stated in magazine articles that {{on a good day}} 2.5 US quarts (2.4 l) of fresh water could be produced. On an overcast day, 1.5 US quarts (1.4 l) was produced. Similar sea water stills are included in some life raft survival kits, though manual reverse osmosis desalinators have mostly replaced them.|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} {{disinfection}} method involves {{some form of}} chlorine or its compounds such as chloramine or chlorine dioxide. Chlorine is a strong oxidant that rapidly kills many harmful micro-organisms. Because chlorine is a toxic gas, {{there is a danger}} of a release associated with its use. This problem is avoided by the use of sodium hypochlorite, which is a relatively inexpensive solution used in household bleach that releases free chlorine when dissolved in water. Chlorine solutions can be generated on site by electrolyzing common salt solutions. A solid form, calcium hypochlorite, releases chlorine on contact with water. Handling the solid, however, requires greater routine human contact through <b>opening</b> <b>bags</b> and pouring than the use of gas cylinders or bleach which are more easily automated. The generation of liquid sodium hypochlorite is both inexpensive and safer than the use of gas or solid chlorine.|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} seals {{is used to}} close bags. Each seal has {{advantages}} and disadvantages. For shop assistants sealing bags could be a repetitive physically demanding action. Opening and closing the bags again can cause some discomfort or annoyance for consumers. Besides, it is an activity which can endanger safety, i. e., knives being used in opening, children swallowing the systems of sealing. To prevent these problems a new sealing system was developed. In this paper the opinion of shop assistants, consumers and experts on several bag sealing systems was studied. It appeared that for sealing plastic bags, adhesive tape with paper is {{the best out of}} 4 systems, closely followed by adhesive tape. It is discussed that for the elderly, there is still room for improvement in <b>opening</b> <b>bag</b> seals. ergonomics safety comfort 1. MANUAL BAG SEALING Customers continually expect a faster, more efficient and more thorough service at supermarkets [1], but also in other shops where bags are sealed. Manual bag sealing is often used in shops where products are sold that have to be protected fo...|$|R
40|$|Submitted to Humanoids 2017 International audienceWe {{propose a}} multi-robot {{quadratic}} program (QP) controller for retargeting of a human's multi-contact loco-manipulation motions to a humanoid robot. Using this framework, the robot can track complex motions and automatically adapt to {{objects in the}} environment that have different physical properties from those {{that were used to}} provide the human's reference motion. The whole-body multi-contact manipulation problem is formulated as a multi-robot QP, which optimizes over the combined dynamics of the robot and any manipulated objects. The multi-robot QP maintains a dynamic partition of the robot's tracking links into fixed support contact, manipulation contact, and contact-free tracking links, which are re-partitioned and re-instantiated as constraints in the multi-robot QP every time a contact event occurs in the human motion. We present various experiments (<b>bag</b> retrieval, door <b>opening,</b> box lifting) using human motion data from an Xsens inertial motion capture system. We show in full-body dynamics simulation that the robot is able to perform difficult single-stance motions as well as multi-contact-stance motions (including hand supports), while adapting to objects of varying inertial properties...|$|R
30|$|The risk of {{intraperitoneal}} fragment {{dissemination of}} uterine tissue, especially {{the dissemination of}} unexpected leiomyosarcoma during electromechanical morcellation, has been increasingly debated during the last year. An improved technique for contained morcellation of uterine tissue inside an insufflated plastic bag during laparoscopy is presented. Twenty-one consecutive contained morcellations were carried out {{during the summer of}} 2014, at one institution. Five laparoscopic myomectomies and 16 hysterectomies were performed. Standard laparoscopic equipment was used and a transparent plastic bag was introduced into the abdominal cavity through the umbilical incision mounted on two curved blunt metal probes, which facilitated the placement of the uterine tissue into the bag. Morcellation was carried out inside the plastic <b>bag</b> through the <b>opening</b> in the umbilicus. All 21 morcellations during the study period were successfully performed. The median operative time was 105  min (range 45 – 180  min) and applying plastic bag and trocar median 10  min (range 4 – 30  min). Median specimen weight was 560  g (range 80 – 1265  g). No complications occurred, and no unintended bag perforation was identified. The presented improved contained morcellation technique is feasible in laparoscopic hysterectomy and myomectomy. Larger studies will however be required before the general introduction of the method.|$|R
