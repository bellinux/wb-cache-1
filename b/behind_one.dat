5|$|Along with Democrats John Stuart Williams, William Lindsay, and J. Proctor Knott, and Republican Robert Boyd, McCreary was {{nominated}} for a U.S. Senate seat in 1878. Democrats were divided by sectionalism and initially unable to unite <b>behind</b> <b>one</b> of their four candidates. After more than a week of caucusing among Democratic legislators, the nominations of McCreary, Knott, and Lindsay were withdrawn, and Williams was elected over Boyd. Historian Hambleton Tapp opined that the withdrawals were likely a part of some kind of deal among legislators, although the details of the deal, if it ever existed, were not made public.|$|E
5|$|At {{the south}} end of the ground, <b>behind</b> <b>one</b> goal, the Park End Stand backs onto Walton Lane which borders Stanley Park. The name of the stand was {{originally}} the Stanley Park End but it's commonly referred to as the Park End. The single tiered stand broke from the multi-tiered tradition of Goodison Park. The Park End has the smallest capacity at Goodison Park. The current layout of the stand was opened on 17 September 1994 with a capacity of 5,750. It was opened by David Hunt, a Member of Parliament. During the structure's development, fans were able to watch matches by climbing trees in neighbouring Stanley Park.|$|E

5|$|At 07:00 on 6 October, 9 Platoon C Company—under {{the command}} of Lieutenant Arthur Pembroke—moved forward to Sierra, using the heavy mist to conceal their movements.

Without fire support and outnumbered, the Australians immediately conducted a quick attack and, using grenades and bayonets, they inflicted heavy casualties on the Chinese before forcing the survivors to withdraw. Although subjected to constant shelling, 9 Platoon continued to hold the knoll, repelling several counterattacks over the next 13 hours, cutting down each assault through the tree-line and long grass with accurate rifle and machine-gun fire, forcing the Chinese to withdraw leaving their dead and wounded <b>behind.</b> <b>One</b> Australian was killed in the initial assault on Sierra, while a number were later wounded during the defence. Chinese casualties included 19 killed, 30 wounded and seven captured. Pembroke was later awarded the Military Cross.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the early}} Jurchens had no written records, {{the story of}} Hanpu was first {{transmitted}} orally. According to the History of Jin (compiled in the 1340s), Hanpu arrived from Goryeo {{at the age of}} sixty and settled among the Jurchen Wanyan clan. Other sources claim that Hanpu was from Silla, the state that had ruled the Korean peninsula but was annexed by Goryeo in 935. The same story recounts that when Hanpu left Goryeo, his two brothers remained <b>behind,</b> <b>one</b> in Goryeo and one in the Balhae area. Because the Jurchens considered Hanpu to be the sixth-generation ancestor of Wanyan Wugunai (1021–1074), historians postulate that Hanpu lived in the early tenth century, when the Jurchens still consisted of independent tribes, or sometime between the founding of Goryeo in 918 and its destruction of Silla in 935.|$|E

5|$|The {{bombing and}} {{strafing}} of native villages by the Allied Air Forces caused some 600 Goodenough Islanders {{to flee to}} Fergusson Island, where Timperley's ANGAU detachment {{had set up a}} refugee camp and was caring for them until the fighting was over and they could safely return. Australian losses on Goodenough Island were 13 killed in action or died of wounds, and 19 wounded. The Japanese suffered 20 killed and 15 wounded during the battle, but the 2/12th counted 39 dead. However, this was only an estimate as the Japanese had been able to retrieve and bury their dead, which had made it difficult for the Australians to accurately determine their casualties. Despite the evacuation, some Japanese were left <b>behind.</b> <b>One</b> was captured by islanders on 30 October and handed over to Timperley.

5|$|The site of One Meridian Plaza {{was bought}} by the Arden Group in 2000. The site was {{converted}} into a parking lot as construction on a new building was held up in a zoning feud with the neighboring site, 1441 Chestnut Street. 1441 Chestnut Street {{was the site of}} the Morris Building and other smaller buildings that sat <b>behind</b> <b>One</b> Meridian Plaza. The feud between Arden Group's chief executive Craig Spencer and 1441 Chestnut Street developer Tim Mahoney began in 2003. Spencer and Mahoney settled their dispute in March 2006 and construction on One Meridian's 48-story replacement, the Residences at the Ritz-Carlton began in May. The Residences at The Ritz-Carlton opened in January 2009. A memorial was unveiled on October 21, 2009 at the skyscraper honoring the three firefighters who died in the fire. The memorial features three bronze firefighter helmets atop a marble base with the firefighters' names on it. It sits in an empty area between the condo building and the adjacent hotel along the south side of South Penn Square across from the SW corner of Dilworth Park.|$|E
5|$|York's {{first ground}} was Fulfordgate, which was located on Heslington Lane, Fulford in the {{south-east}} of York. With the ground not ready, York played {{their first two}} home matches at Mille Crux, Haxby Road, before they took to the field at Fulfordgate for a 4–1 win over Mansfield Town on 20 September 1922. Fulfordgate was gradually improved; terracing was replaced banking <b>behind</b> <b>one</b> of the goals, the covered Popular Stand was extended to house 1,000 supporters, and a small seated stand was erected. By the time of York's election to the Football League in 1929, the ground was estimated to hold a capacity of 17,000. However, attendances declined in York's second and third Football League seasons, and the directors blamed this on the ground's location. In April 1932, York's shareholders voted to move to Bootham Crescent, which had been vacated by York Cricket Club, on a 21-year lease. This site was located near the city centre, and had a significantly higher population living nearby than Fulfordgate.|$|E

5|$|By February 26 city {{officials}} had determined One Meridian Plaza {{was not in}} danger of collapse. There was structural damage to horizontal steel beams and floor sections {{on most of the}} fire damaged floors. Under extreme fire exposure the beams and girders sagged and twisted and cracks appeared in the concrete floors. However, the overall structure was stable and able to support the weight of the building. Thermal expansion of the steel frame caused some of the granite panels to be dislodged from the building's facade. The streets and buildings around One Meridian Plaza were closed and cordoned off. The 20-story Morris Building and several three-story shops <b>behind</b> <b>One</b> Meridian Plaza on Chestnut Street were damaged by falling debris and sat unused for years until they were demolished in 2000. The neighboring Girard Trust Building, then called Two Mellon Plaza, experienced extensive water damage forcing the closure of the building. A bank in the building reopened a month later {{but the rest of the}} tower remained vacant for years. The roads around the building were closed for months after the fire, including a portion of two of Philadelphia's major streets, Broad and Market.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the Mesozoic to present, {{the region}} went through a series of uplifts and erosional sequences. Commencing 66million years ago the Laramide orogeny was a period of mountain-building and erosion in western North America that created the ancestral Rocky Mountains. This cycle of uplift and erosion left <b>behind</b> <b>one</b> of the most {{complete}} non-marine Cenozoic rock sequences found in North America. Conglomerate rocks composed of quartzite and interspersed with mudstone and sandstones were deposited during erosion from a now vanished mountain range that existed to the northwest of the current Teton Range. These deposits also have trace quantities of gold and mercury. During the Eocene and Oligocene, volcanic eruptions from the ancestral Absaroka Range buried the region under various volcanic deposits. Sedimentary basins developed in the region due to drop faulting, creating an ancestral Jackson Hole and by the Pliocene (10million years ago), an ancestral Jackson Lake known as Teewinot Lake. During the Quaternary, landslides, erosion and glacial activity deposited soils and rock debris throughout the Snake River valley of Jackson Hole and left behind terminal moraines which impound the current lakes. The most recent example of rapid alteration to the landscape occurred in 1925 just east of the park, when the Gros Ventre landslide was triggered by spring melt from a heavy snowpack as well as heavy rain.|$|E
5|$|Manningham RFC {{continued}} playing until 1903, when financial difficulties, {{caused by}} relegation {{at the turn}} of the century, prompted club officials to change codes from rugby football to association football. The first association football game to be played at Valley Parade was a promotional fixture on 6 April 1903 between a side of West Yorkshire footballers and Sheffield United's 1903 FA Cup winning side. The game had been organised to stimulate interest in the sport in Bradford and attracted 8,000 fans. The new football club, Bradford City, were elected to The Football League's Division Two the following month. Bradford City's first game at Valley Parade came on 5 September 1903 against Gainsborough Trinity, drawing a crowd of 11,000. As a result of alterations first implemented in 1897, City players originally changed in a shed <b>behind</b> <b>one</b> end of the ground, and visiting teams used the old rugby club dressing rooms at the back of the nearby Belle Vue Hotel. However, after City's 5–1 defeat by Manchester United on 10 February 1906, United player Bob Bonthron was attacked as he left the ground. As a result, The Football Association closed the ground for 14 days, ordering City to switch its changing rooms to the nearby Artillery Barracks for the 1906–07 season. Several supporters faced criminal proceedings for the incident.|$|E

5|$|Realising {{that they}} had only faced a series of probes the {{previous}} night, rather than a major attack, and as these actions {{may have been in}} preparation for a heavier attack, a vigorous defence was subsequently prepared by the Australians with the reserve companies moved into blocking positions to strengthen the forward defences. The defenders endured steady shelling and harassing fire, while after dark The Hook was probed again, this time by a group of about 20 Chinese. The force was subsequently engaged by an Australian standing patrol from D Company at 21:00 and forced to withdraw, leaving <b>behind</b> <b>one</b> dead at a cost of one Australian killed and one wounded. At 21:20 the Chinese fire became more intense, and a heavy blow was launched by the Chinese against the Marines on Hill 119 shortly after. Beginning at 21:30, elements of the 1st and 7th Marines were attacked by two Chinese companies. A heavy concentration by the entire US I Corps artillery was fired in response, and the Chinese were forced to withdraw. At 23:00 the Chinese shelling intensified to thirty-rounds per minute, and was followed fifteen minutes later by another determined charge by the Chinese infantry against the US Marines on the left flank on Hill 111 and Boulder City during a furious attack. The Australian positions were not directly attacked during the night, although C Company engaged the Chinese in no man's land sporadically at long range in support of the Americans. As on the previous night, 3 RAR was not attacked. In total more than 4,200 mortar and artillery rounds were fired by the Chinese at 2 RAR during the night, and three Australians were killed and nine wounded.|$|E
5|$|The Panic of 1837 and the {{depression}} that followed caused many to blame Van Buren and his Democratic Party {{for the hard}} times, making {{it more likely that}} the Whig nominee in 1840 would be the next president. In addition to Harrison and Webster, Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky sought the nomination, as did General Winfield Scott. Some Whigs argued that because {{the depression}} was driving many to their ranks, {{there was no need to}} nominate a relative outsider such as Harrison; the party could win <b>behind</b> <b>one</b> of its statesmen, Clay or Webster, and by 1838, Clay was the frontrunner. A slaveholder, he commanded the near-united support of the South, though this came at the price of alienating many Northern Whigs. There was wide consensus in the party that a national convention was needed to decide on a presidential candidate, and in late 1837, the Whig congressional caucus agreed to work with the state parties to organize a convention. After considerable maneuvering, a convention to nominate candidates for president and vice president was called by the congressional caucus in May 1838, to be held at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania beginning on December 4, 1839. Having failed to gain much support, Webster dropped out of the race in June 1839.|$|E
