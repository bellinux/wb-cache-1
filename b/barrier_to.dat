5|$|Banksia prionotes × hookeriana {{has also}} been {{verified}} as occurring in the wild, but only in disturbed locations. The two parent species have overlapping ranges and are pollinated by the same honeyeater species; and though preferring different soils, they often occur near enough {{to each other for}} pollinators to move between them. It therefore appears that the only <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> hybridisation in undisturbed areas is the different flowering seasons: B.prionotes has usually finished flowering by the end of May, whereas flowering of B.hookeriana usually does not begin until June. In disturbed areas, however, the increased runoff and reduced competition mean extra nutrients are available, and this results in larger plants with more flowers and a longer flowering season. Thus the flowering seasons overlap, and the sole <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> interbreeding is removed. The resultant F1 hybrids are fully fertile, with seed production rates {{similar to that of the}} parent species. There is no <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> backcrossing of hybrids with parent species, and in some populations this has resulted in hybrid swarms. This raises the possibility of the parent species gradually losing their genetic integrity, especially if the intermediate characteristics of the hybrid offer it a competitive advantage over the parent species, such as a wider habitat tolerance. Moreover, speciation might occur if the hybrid's intermediate characteristics allow it to occupy a habitat unsuited to both parents, such as an intermediate soil type.|$|E
