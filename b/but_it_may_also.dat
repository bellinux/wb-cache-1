5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of rhabdomyolysis may be suspected in {{anyone who has}} suffered trauma, crush injury or prolonged immobilization, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be identified at a later stage due to deteriorating kidney function (abnormally raised or increasing creatinine and urea levels, falling urine output) or reddish-brown discoloration of the urine.|$|E
5|$|DKA most {{frequently}} occurs {{in those who}} already have diabetes, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be the first presentation in someone who had not previously been known to be diabetic. There is often a particular underlying problem {{that has led to}} the DKA episode; this may be intercurrent illness (pneumonia, influenza, gastroenteritis, a urinary tract infection), pregnancy, inadequate insulin administration (e.g. defective insulin pen device), myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke or the use of cocaine. Young people with recurrent episodes of DKA may have an underlying eating disorder, or may be using insufficient insulin for fear that it will cause weight gain.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{take time to}} develop, {{and as many as}} half of cases are asymptomatic at the initial presentation. The more severe the injury, the more quickly symptoms become apparent. In severe cases, symptoms may occur as quickly as three or fourhours after the trauma. Hypoxemia (low oxygen concentration in the arterial blood) typically becomes progressively worse over 24–48hours after injury. In general, pulmonary contusion tends to worsen slowly over a few days, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> cause rapid deterioration or death if untreated.|$|E

5|$|The {{embryonic}} individual of Dinocephalosaurus preserved inside LPV 30280 from Luoping can {{be identified}} as such for several reasons. First, it is enclosed entirely within the body cavity of the adult. Its cervical ribs - which are long, {{like that of the}} adult - face the same direction as the dorsal vertebrae of the adult, which is in contradiction to the typical head-first method of swallowing prey among amniotes. It is also preserved with its neck curling towards its forelimbs, a posture which is seen among vertebrate embryos but not adult Dinocephalosaurus specimens, which generally have the neck bent upwards. The absence of hands associated with the forelimbs in the embryo may be an artifact of preservation, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be due to the sequence in which the limb bones of tetrapods ossify.|$|E
5|$|The {{intersection}} of 7th Street NW and H Street NW {{is the heart}} of D.C.'s Chinatown neighborhood today, but prior to the 1930s it was populated primarily by German immigrants. Before the American Civil War, 7th Street NW was the city's primary commercial district, the street lined with three-story Federal-style townhouses with shops on the ground floor and residences above. Lincoln conspirator Mary Surratt's boarding house (604 H Street NW) has been substantially renovated through the years (and currently houses a Chinese restaurant), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> house Mary Surratt's ghost. From the 1870s onward, occupants of the building have claimed that Surratt's spirit is responsible for the incomprehensible mumbling and whispers, footsteps, muffled sobs, and creaking floorboards which have unnerved them.|$|E

50|$|Anteosaurus {{like other}} related therapsids had a {{thickened}} skull (pachyostosis), {{and this has}} been suggested as an adaptation for head butting, or perhaps more aptly for head pushing. Also like with Moschops, the overall build seems to have been for projecting its body weight forwards. Not only could this have been useful in dominance head pushing contests, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have <b>also</b> been a technique to knock over unsuspecting or weakened prey.|$|R

25|$|For instance, de Haan (1999, 2001, 2005) {{states that}} evidentiality asserts {{evidence}} while epistemic modality evaluates evidence and that evidentiality is {{more akin to}} a deictic category marking the relationship between speakers and events/actions (like the way demonstratives mark the relationship between speakers and objects, see also Joseph 2003). Aikhenvald (2003) finds that evidentials may indicate a speaker's attitude {{about the validity of}} a statement {{but this is not a}} required feature of evidentials. Additionally, she finds that evidential-marking may co-occur with epistemic-marking, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> co-occur with aspectual/tense or mirative marking.|$|E
25|$|A {{kitchen is}} a room {{or part of}} a room used for cooking and food {{preparation}} in a dwelling or in a commercial establishment. In the West, a modern residential kitchen is typically equipped with a stove, a sink with hot and cold running water, a refrigerator, counters and kitchen cabinets arranged according to a modular design. Many households have a microwave oven, a dishwasher and other electric appliances.

The animal had a typical home range of between 40 and 80 km2. It appears to have kept to its home range without being territorial; groups too large to be a family unit were sometimes observed together.|$|R

25|$|The High Courts {{are split}} into chambers, each {{consisting}} of three High Court judges (landsdommere), {{one of which}} may be a High Court judge pro tempura (konstitueret landsdommer). Every case is assigned a chamber and a panel of three judges is constituted to hear the case, usually composed of the three judges of the chamber <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be composed of judges across the chambers or of more than three judges. Though the President of the High Court appoints a presiding judge for each chamber, all decisions are reached by a simple majority except in jury trials where a qualified majority is necessary for a guilty verdict.|$|E
25|$|The {{supporters}} of the cult at Uppsala drew a mutual agreement of toleration with Olof Skötkonung, the first Christian king of Sweden, who ascended to the throne in the 990s. Presumably Olof Skötkonung {{was not in a}} powerful enough position to violently enforce the observance of Christianity in Uppland. Instead he established an episcopal see at Skara in Västergötland, near his own stronghold at Husaby around 1000. Another episcopal see was established at Sigtuna in the 1060s by King Stenkil, according to Adam of Bremen. This seat was moved to Gamla Uppsala probably some time between 1134 and 1140. This might have been because of Uppsala's importance as an old royal residence and thing site, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have been inspired by a desire to show that the resistance to Christianity in Uppland had been defeated. By papal initiative an archdiocese for Sweden was established at Uppsala in 1164.|$|E
25|$|Across the world, it {{is common}} for people to sleep in the same bed as one another after copulation. Humans are {{more likely to engage in}} sexual {{activity}} at night, so therefore night-time brings the highest danger of infidelity. Due to females investing more in the relationship (Parental investment), women therefore receive more benefits from sleeping with their mate during the night. Keeping close proximity with a partner acts as a mate guarding technique as it minimises the likelihood of unfaithfulness by the male, and also assures their partner of her fidelity. As a result of the paternal confidence, the male is also more likely to stay and provide resources. In one study it was found that 73.7% of participants said that females are more likely to want to sleep together after sexual intercourse. Mate guarding is a very likely explanation to this, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have the benefits of increasing the female's protection, potentially from male poachers.|$|E
