These are changes that Sawyer wanted included in the game, but they were not released as an official update.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study convex {{stochastic}} optimization problems where a noisy objective function value is observed after {{a decision is}} made. There are many stochastic optimization problems whose behavior depends on an exogenous state variable which affects {{the shape of the}} objective function. Currently, there is no general purpose algorithm to solve this class of problems. We use nonparametric density estimation to take observations from the joint state-outcome distribution and use them to infer the optimal decision for a given query state s. We propose two solution methods that depend on the problem characteristics: function-based and gradient-based optimization. We examine two <b>weighting</b> schemes, kernel <b>based</b> <b>weights</b> and Dirichlet process <b>based</b> <b>weights,</b> for use with the solution methods. The weights and solution methods are tested on a synthetic multi-product newsvendor problem and the hour ahead wind commitment problem. Our results show that in some cases Dirichlet process weights offer substantial benefits over kernel <b>based</b> <b>weights</b> and more generally that nonparametric estimation methods provide good solutions to otherwise intractable problems. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{evaluate}} how the stock index SIX 30 RX compares against portfolios {{based on the same}} stock selection but with alternative weighting techniques. Eleven alternative weighting techniques are used and divided into three categories; heuristic, optimisation and momentum based ones. These are evaluated from 1990 - 01 - 01 until 2014 - 12 - 31. The results show that heuristic <b>based</b> <b>weighting</b> techniques overperform and show similar risk characteristics as the SIX 30 RX index. Optimisation <b>based</b> <b>weighting</b> techniques show strong overperformance but have different risk characteristics manifested in higher portfolio concentration and tracking error. Momentum <b>based</b> <b>weighting</b> techniques have slightly better performance and risk-adjusted performance while their risk concentration and average annual turnover is higher than all other techniques used. Minimum variance is the overall best performing weighting technique in terms of return and risk-adjusted return. Additionally, the equal weighted portfolio overperforms and has similar characteristics as the SIX 30 RX index despite its simple heuristic approach. In conclusion, all studied alternative weighting techniques except the momentum based ones clearly overperform the SIX 30 RX index...|$|R

Additionally, for artificial track races the athlete must first be weighed. This is to determine if the athlete is entitled to carry extra weight on their body while sliding. Men may use additional weight amounting to 75% of the difference between body weight and a <b>base</b> <b>weight</b> of 90 kg. Women may use additional weight amounting to 50% of the difference between body weight and a <b>base</b> <b>weight</b> of 70 kg. Doubles athletes may use additional weight amounting to 50% of the difference between body weight and a <b>base</b> <b>weight</b> of 90 kg. Additional weight is not allowed if the body weight of the front person and back person together exceeds 180 kg. If one of the partners weighs more than 90 kg, the weight exceeding the 90 kg mark is added to the lighter partner. If there should still be a difference between the partner’s weight and the 90 kg mark, the difference can be compensated according to an official weight table. Between runs athletes are randomly selected for additional weight checks. Before each run the sled (with the athlete, for artificial track races) is weighed at the start ramp.|$|E

40|$|Using expert {{judgment}} {{data from the}} TU Delft's {{expert judgment}} data base, we compare the performance of different weighting schemes, namely equal <b>weighting,</b> performance <b>based</b> <b>weighting</b> from the classical model (Cooke, 1991), social network (SN) weighting and likelihood weighting. The picture that emerges with regard to social network weights is rather mixed. SN theory does not provide an alternative to performance based combination of expert judgments, since the statistical accuracy of the SN decision maker is sometimes unacceptably low. On the other hand, it does outperform equal weighting {{in the majority of}} cases. The results here, though not overwhelmingly positive, do nonetheless motivate further research into social interaction methods for nominating and weighting experts. Indeed, a full expert judgment study with performance measurement requires an investment in time and effort, with a view to securing external validation. If high confidence in a comparable level of validation can be obtained by less intensive methods, this would be very welcome, and would facilitate the application of structured expert judgment in situations where the resources for a full study are not available. Likelihood weights are just as resource intensive as performance <b>based</b> <b>weights,</b> and the evidence presented here suggests that they are inferior to performance <b>based</b> <b>weights</b> with regard to those scoring variables which are optimized in performance weights (calibration and information). Perhaps surprisingly, they are also inferior with regard to likelihood. Their use is further discouraged {{by the fact that they}} constitute a strongly improper scoring rule...|$|R
