5|$|BoxBoy! {{received}} a positive reception from critics. Reviewers praised the game's creative puzzles and inventive {{use of the}} box-manipulation mechanics. Some critics were pleasantly surprised <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> content that was offered and agreed that the package was good value for money. However, the game's simple art style was divisive among reviewers. A sequel, BoxBoxBoy!, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2016, with a third game, Bye-Bye BoxBoy!, in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Each {{radioactive}} isotope has a characteristic decay time period—the half-life—that is determined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> time needed {{for half of}} a sample to decay.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to manufacture an emulsified product with high emulsifying ability and emulsion stability by mixing minced meat from lizardfish with chicken-egg and rapeseed oil for better processing. The emulsifying ability and emulsion {{stability of the}} products were improved <b>by</b> increasing <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> oil added, and moreover, the former was improved <b>by</b> increasing <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> chicken-egg added. <b>The</b> emulsion stability of the products differed depending {{on the state of}} the egg added, i. e. the stability of the product with egg-white was highest, consequently, the stability of the product with whole egg was greater than that of the product with egg-yolk. The Hunter whiteness of the products was improved <b>by</b> increasing <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> oil added. <b>The</b> fishy odor in the product was depressed <b>by</b> increasing <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> egg and oil added to the meat.

5|$|Erosion acting upon {{different}} types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating the valleys, canyons, domes, and other features we see today. These joints and fracture systems do not move, and are therefore not faults.

5|$|Although {{capable of}} {{generating}} a high volume of fire, autocannon are limited <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> ammunition {{that can be}} carried by the weapons systems mounting them. For this reason, both the 25mm Bushmaster and the 30mm RARDEN are deliberately designed with relatively slow rates of fire, to extend {{the amount of time}} they can be employed on a battlefield before requiring a resupply of ammunition. The rate of fire of modern autocannon ranges from 90 rounds per minute, to 1,800 rounds per minute. Systems with multiple barrels—Gatling guns—can have rates of fire of several thousand rounds per minute; the fastest of these is the GSh-6-30K, which has a rate of fire of over 6,000rounds per minute.|$|E

5|$|Headley {{was born}} in Colón, Panama on 30 May 1909, the son of DeCourcy Headley and Irene Roberts. Neither of Headley's parents was from Panama; his father was from Barbados and his mother from Jamaica, but they had moved to Panama while DeCourcey worked on the {{construction}} of the Panama Canal. By the time Headley was five years old the Canal was complete, and the family moved to Cuba in search of further employment. In 1919, concerned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> Spanish being spoken by her son, Headley's mother took him to Jamaica so he could be educated in an English-speaking school.|$|E
5|$|Leguat {{stated that}} the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} fed on dates, whereas Tafforet mentioned seeds and leaves. No other accounts mention diet. It has been suggested it ate latan palm fruits, for which it competed with the now extinct Cylindraspis tortoises. It is not known how the young were fed, but related pigeons provide crop milk. The risings on the crop of the female may have covered glands that produced the crop milk. If the theory is correct, the birds may have practiced a division of labour, where the female stayed and fed the young crop milk, while the male collected food in the crop and delivered it to the female. It {{has been suggested that}} the maximum size attained by the solitaire and the dodo was limited <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> crop milk they were able to produce for their young during early growth.|$|E
5|$|Significant change {{occurred}} when the Manchester Ship Canal was opened in 1894. The tidal section of the river below Frodsham now flowed into the ship canal, rather than the River Mersey, and the exit lock from Weston Docks also joined the canal rather than the estuary. A new ship lock was constructed at Weston Marsh, which provided a more convenient route to the ship canal than the alternative route through Weston Point docks. The Weston Canal has been little used since. Although {{it is possible for}} pleasure craft to reach the Weaver from the Ship Canal, it is a commercial waterway, and most leisure users are dissuaded from doing so <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> paperwork and the requirements of the operating company.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} was initially {{powered by the}} Pegasus 6 engine which {{was replaced by the}} more powerful Pegasus 11 during the Harrier GR.1 to GR.3 upgrade process. The primary focus throughout the engine's development was on achieving high performance with as little weight as possible, tempered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> funding that was available. Following the Harrier's entry to service the focus switched to improving reliability and extending engine life; a formal joint US–UK Pegasus Support Program operated for many years and spent a £3-million annual budget to develop engine improvements. Several variants have been released; the latest is the Pegasus 11–61 (Mk 107), which provides 23,800lbf (106kN) thrust, more than any previous engine.|$|E
5|$|The {{total amount}} of energy that a star can {{generate}} through nuclear fusion of hydrogen is limited <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen fuel that can be consumed at the core. For a star in equilibrium, the energy generated at the core {{must be at least}} equal to the energy radiated at the surface. Since the luminosity gives the amount of energy radiated per unit time, the total life span can be estimated, to first approximation, as the total energy produced divided by the star's luminosity.|$|E
5|$|Water {{levels have}} been {{recorded}} since 1875, averaging about 4,200 feet (1,280m) above sea level. Since the Great Salt Lake is a shallow lake with gently sloping shores around all edges except on the south side, small variations in the water level greatly affect {{the extent of the}} shoreline. The water level can rise dramatically in wet years and fall during dry years. The water level is also affected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> water flow diverted for agricultural and urban uses. The Jordan and Weber rivers, in particular, are diverted for other uses. In the 1880s Grove Karl Gilbert predicted that the lake– then in the middle of many years of recession– would virtually disappear except for a small remnant between the islands.|$|E

Deamination occurs when an amino group is lost and is a mutation that often results in base changes. When adenine is deaminated, it becomes hypoxanthine. Hypoxanthine can bind to cytosine, and when the XC base pair is replicated, it becomes a GC (thus, an A → G base change).|$|R
5|$|After {{shedding}} {{the burden}} of less profitable and unwieldy land with its angry residents, Burnside was on its own. The new Burnside District Council held its first meeting at the Greengate Inn, Tusmore on 19 August 1856. Due to {{the time it took}} to elect new councillors, it was not until 29 December that the council met again. Dr Christopher Penfold, chairman, met the rest of the representatives there: Daniel Ferguson of Glenunga, Alexander Ferguson of Monreith, John Townsend of Magill and James Grylls of Belle Vue. It was during this time that Kent Town decided against becoming a part of Burnside and instead applied to enter the Corporate Town of Kensington and Norwood. The council was to meet at the Inn or at Ferguson's home right up until December 1869, when the first council chambers were built. However, it was still able to operate and fulfill its obligations under the Local Government Act 1852. These included the management of minor roads, the administration of abattoir licences and public houses, and the prevention of the spread of the noxious Scotch thistle. The council was also obliged, under a different act of 1851, to encourage education. Much road and bridgework activity happened after the council had been formed—early residents were amazed at the influx of development and construction that occurred. At the same time, the council was almost overwhelmed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> work requested, and was forced to ask individual ratepayers for monetary assistance when building bridges in their area.|$|E
5|$|Its {{by-product}} status {{means that}} indium production is constrained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> sulfidic zinc (and copper) ores extracted each year. Therefore, its availability {{needs to be}} {{discussed in terms of}} supply potential. The supply potential of a by-product is defined as that amount which is economically extractable from its host materials per year under current market conditions (i.e. technology and price). Reserves and resources are not relevant for by-products, since they cannot be extracted independently from the main-products. Recent estimates put the supply potential of indium at a minimum of 1,300 t/yr from sulfidic zinc ores and 20 t/yr from sulfidic copper ores. These figures are significantly greater than current production (655 t in 2016). Thus, major future increases in the by-product production of indium will be possible without significant increases in production costs or price. The average indium price in 2016 was $US240/kg, down from $US705/kg in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{problems}} {{this created}} were counterbalanced {{to some extent}} by his successes, particularly in the Balkans; Manuel extended the frontiers of his Empire in the Balkan region, ensuring security {{for the whole of}} Greece and Bulgaria. Had he been more successful in all his ventures, he would have controlled not only the most productive farmland around the Eastern Mediterranean and Adriatic seas, but also the entire trading facilities of the area. Even if he did not achieve his ambitious goals, his wars against Hungary brought him control of the Dalmatian coast, the rich agricultural region of Sirmium, and the Danube trade route from Hungary to the Black Sea. His Balkan expeditions are said to have taken great booty in slaves and livestock; Kinnamos was impressed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> arms taken from the Hungarian dead after the battle of 1167. And even if Manuel's wars against the Turks probably realised a net loss, his commanders took livestock and captives on at least two occasions.|$|E
