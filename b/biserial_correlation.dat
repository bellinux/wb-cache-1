The physical meaning of <b>biserial</b> <b>correlation</b> fields between variables representing synoptic-scale circulation, particularly vorticity fields, and local precipitation is explored. One purpose is to examine this approach used to link the large-scale circulation and the smaller-scale surface environment, {{which seems to be}} simple, efficient and easy to interpret. An analysis based on <b>biserial</b> <b>correlation</b> configurations between 500 hPa vorticity and precipitation takes into account anomalous vorticity gradients including curvature and shear effects to describe some mechanisms favoring the occurrence of rainfall. It is shown that anomalies in the curvature of synoptic systems are largely causing precipitation. Daily precipitation at Córdoba, Argentina is used as an example to illustrate the results. The position of the cyclonic and anticyclonic anomaly centers and the position of the jet streams in association with precipitation may be clearly identified.

These electric and magnetic waves in electromagnetic radiation have certain {{characteristics such as}} frequency, wavelength and amplitude. Based {{on one of these}} characteristics namely frequency, a research focuses on classification of human gender was conducted. The goal of this research is to classify human gender using human radiation measured in frequency. In this research, the radiation emitted from nine points on human body was measured and analyzed using mean and min-max normalization. The hypothesis of this research which states that the frequencies of male radiation are not equal to the frequencies of female radiation was tested. Next, feature extraction on nine human radiation points was performed using Pearson's, Spearman's and Point <b>Biserial</b> <b>correlation.</b> From these correlations, two groups of points were selected and extracted. The extracted points together with nine points were used in gender classification and classifier validation. The results show that group using Point <b>Biserial</b> <b>correlation</b> achieved higher accuracy compared to group using Pearson’s and Spearman's correlation. Hence, human radiation frequencies can be used for gender classification.

Seventy-eight parents and 71 twins, who had completed the MFQ, were interviewed separately using a semistructured diagnostic interview, the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment. Parent-rated MFQ scores (MFQ-P) were found to distinguish those with ICD- 10 (point <b>biserial</b> <b>correlation</b> = 0. 345) and DSM-III-R depression (point <b>biserial</b> <b>correlation</b> = 0. 369) from non-depressed cases. MFQ-P scores also differentiated depressed cases from those with 'other psychiatric diagnoses' (any anxiety disorder, oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, hyperkinetic disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and adjustment disorder/post-traumatic disorder). The MFQ-P at the chosen cut-off point showed a sensitivity of 0. 75 and specificity of 0. 73 for an ICD- 10 diagnosis of depression and a sensitivity of 0. 86 and specificity of 0. 87 for DSM-III-R depression. The number of self-rated reports (MFQ-C) was small, but overall the results suggest that self-rated MFQ scores may show less specificity.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, 1976 The State Trait {{model of}} Curiosity {{developed}} by Drs. Naylor and Gaudry was modified {{for use with}} seventh grade subjects. Extra items were written, making a thirty [...] six item four choice Likert scale for trait and for state curiosity. 150 boys and 159 girls completed the trait scale, a word knowledge test, a curiosity stimulating task, and the state scale. The scales were analysed using the computer program Testat. Items were {{selected on the basis}} of their point <b>biserial</b> <b>correlations.</b> Splitting the subjects on their sex and vocabulary scores showed that many items had considerable bias. Reducing the reversed and the non-reversed subscales by removing small groups of items produced scales almost identical to those containing the items with the highest correlations. A factor analysis justified the distinction between state and trait curiosity and between reversed and non-reversed items. The loadings on the three factor Varimax rotation were highly correlated with the items' point <b>biserial</b> <b>correlations.</b> Sample-free item analysis attempts to analyse data so that the resulting statistics are independent of the sample used. Similarly it enables comparisons between individuals independently of the tests used. The program Calfit, based on this model, was used to analyse the data rescored at the three possible levels of curiosity. The trait scale fitted the model quite well but the state scale fitted poorly. This was due to the different behaviour of the three curiosity levels and the interaction of a subject's curiosity and the response on many items. Testat proved more effective for item selection but Calfit enabled the linking to previous research. Scales for future use are recommended.

Factor analysis and logit regression were used to develop predictive models of: (a) joining a district; (b) offering and easement; and (c) successfully selling and easement. Contact with other landowners already engaged in successively higher levels of participatory behavior and contact with formal agricultural land policy communication channels are important to both differentiating among the four levels of MALPF program participation and predicting landowner participatory behavior.

The study investigated the extent to which demographic and psychologic variables may influence postoperative pain intensity and tramadol consumption using patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) after cholecystectomy. METHODS: Eighty patients, aged 18 to 70 years, with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II and a body mass index between 18. 5 and 24. 9, undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were enrolled. Self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating questionnaire for depression (SRQ-D) were used [...] 1 day before surgery [...] to assess patients' psychologic status. General anesthesia was standardized. PCA pump with intravenous tramadol was used for a 24 -hour postoperative analgesia. Visual analog scale at rest (VASr) and after coughing (VASi) and tramadol consumption were registered. Pearson's and point <b>biserial</b> <b>correlations,</b> analysis of variance, and step-wise regression were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Pearson r showed positive correlations between anxiety, depression, and pain indicators (P< 0. 05). Moreover, female patients had higher pain indicators (P< 0. 05). Analysis of variance showed that anxious (P< 0. 05) and depressed (P< 0. 001) patients had higher pain indicators, which significantly decreased during the postoperative 24 hours (P< 0. 00001). Regression analysis revealed that tramadol consumption was predicted by preoperative depression (P< 0. 001). VASr was predicted by sex and SRQ-D (P< 0. 05). VASi was predicted by sex and SAS (P< 0. 05). DISCUSSION: Pain perception intensity was primarily predicted by sex with an additional role of depression and anxiety in determining VASr and VASi, respectively. Patients with high depression levels required a larger amount of tramadol. Objectives: Postoperative pain {{is characterized}} by a wide variability of patients pain perception and analgesic requirement. The study investigated the extent to which demographic and psychologic variables may in. uence postoperative pain intensity and tramadol consumption using patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) after cholecystectomy. Methods: Eighty patients, aged 18 to 70 years, with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II and a body mass index between 18. 5 and 24. 9, undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were enrolled. Self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating questionnaire for depression (SRQ-D) were used 1 day before surgery to assess patients psychologic status. General anesthesia was standardized. PCA pump with intravenous tramadol was used for a 24 -hour postoperative analgesia. Visual analog scale at rest (VASr) and after coughing (VASi) and tramadol consumption were registered. Pearson s and point <b>biserial</b> <b>correlations,</b> analysis of variance, and stepwise regression were used for statistical analysis. Results: Pearson r showed positive correlations between anxiety, depression, and pain indicators (P< 0. 05). Moreover, female patients had higher pain indicators (P< 0. 05). Analysis of variance showed that anxious (P< 0. 05) and depressed (P< 0. 001) patients had higher pain indicators, which signi. - cantly decreased during the postoperative 24 hours (P< 0. 00001). Regression analysis revealed that tramadol consumption was predicted by preoperative depression (P< 0. 001). VASr was predicted by sex and SRQ-D (P< 0. 05). VASi was predicted by sex and SAS (P< 0. 05). Discussion: Pain perception intensity was primarily predicted by sex with an additional role of depression and anxiety in determining VASr and VASi, respectively.

Methods: After limited focused training, 2 trained EPs performed bedside echocardiography (BECH) procedures s between January  and June 2012 to prospectively evaluate patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with dyspnea. EPs categorized their visually estimated ejection fractions (VEF) as either low or normal. Formal echocardiography were ordered and performed by an experienced cardiologist using the MSM and accepted as the criterion standard. We compared BECH results for each EP using chi-squared testing and performed correlation analysis by Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: Of the 146 enrolled patients with dyspnea, 13  were excluded and 133 were included in the study. Comparison of EPs vs. cardiologist’s estimate of ejection fraction yielded a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0. 77 (R, p< 0. 0001) and 0. 78 (R, p< 0. 0001). Calculated <b>biserial</b> <b>correlations</b> using point-biserial correlation and z-scores were 1 (rb, p< 0. 0001) for both EPs. The agreement between EPs and the cardiologist was 0. 861 and 0. 876, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and the positive and negative likelihood ratios for each physician were 98. 7 - 98. 7 %, 86. 2 - 87. 9 %, 0. 902 - 0. 914, 0. 980 - 0. 981, 7. 153 - 8. 175, 0. 015 - 0. 015, respectively. Conclusion: EPs with a focused training in limited BECH can assess LVSF accurately in the ED by visual estimation. [West J Emerg Med. 2014; 15 (2) : 221 – 226. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was designed as}} an instructional method, elective class participation (ECP), in which class attendance was not re-quired and the instructor tended to be a guide rather than lec-turer. Ss were adult students enrolled {{in one of two}} semesters of introductory psychology. For two years data were collected on all Ss. Half the sessions were taught the conventional way; the other half used the ECP approach. Hypotheses tested were: Ss in the ECP groups would show more posttest gain over the pretest scores than those in the control groups; the ECP method would elicit favorable reactions. The criterion measure was posttest gain over pretest score. <b>Biserial</b> part <b>correlations</b> were computed be-tween ECP and control groups and posttest score residualized with respect to six control variables: sex, hours attempted, semester grade point average (GPA), cumulative hours completed, cumula...|$|R
