25|$|Today, the {{majority}} of the world's wood bison herds are located in Northern Canada: a small herd of bison discovered {{in the northern part of}} Wood Buffalo National Park. In 1965, 23 of these bison were relocated to the south side of Elk Island National Park and 300 remain there today as the most genetically pure wood bison remaining. While there are many factors that have contributed to the decline of the wood bison, the most prominent are the over-hunting that took place in the 1800s, inadequate conservation methods that led to hybridization with the plains bison and other species, and the spread of communicable diseases. Wood bison were largely over-hunted in the 1800s, and only a few hundred remained in Northern Alberta by early 20th century. By 1957, wood bison were thought to have been finally extinct in Canada due to hybridization with the plains bison, which took place in Wood Buffalo National Park between 1925 and 1928. As wood bison species became threatened with the hybridization, relocation and breeding conservation programs specific to wood bison were established in 1963, and the population increased steadily. From the 1970s to the 90s, however, the population began to decline again with the spread of <b>bovine</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> which resulted from the transfer of infected plains bison to Wood Buffalo National Park. In the case of Wood Buffalo National Park, the number of wood bison declined from 10,000 bison in the late 1960s to 2,200 bison by the late 1990s due to this process. The story of the wood bison in North America is largely one of repeated human mistakes that resulted in critical endagerment of an iconic species.|$|E

Independently, a data bank containing all the published spoligotypes showed that the two most prevalent spoligotypes in the world differed only by {{the presence or absence}} of spacer 31.

By analogy, we suggest that a single-spacer difference in some epidemiologically linked cases of tuberculosis may simply arise due to the insertion of an extra copy of IS 6110 within the DR locus, leading to its asymmetrical disruption and subsequent lack of the DRa or DRb targets. The influence of the IS 6110 preferential insertion sites within the DR locus on spoligotyping results should be further investigated...|$|R

The application of antigens such as ESAT- 6 and CFP- 10 for DIVA has so far been realized largely through their application in the blood-based gamma interferon release assay. In the current study, we have reassessed the potential of such antigens as skin test reagents for DIVA in cattle. A cocktail of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex recombinant protein antigens ESAT- 6, CFP- 10, MPB 70, and MPB 83 elicited delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin test responses in 78 % of naturally infected tuberculin-positive cattle. Importantly, this cocktail induced no skin responses in BCG-vaccinated cattle despite them being sensitized for strong tuberculin responses. Further optimization of skin test antigen combinations identified that the inclusion of Rv 3615 c (Mb 3645 c) enhanced skin test sensitivity in naturally infected cattle without compromising specificity. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time the utility of synthetic peptides as promising skin test antigens for bovine TB for DIVA. Our data provide a promising basis for the future development of skin tests for DIVA with practical relevance for TB diagnosis in both veterinary and clinical settings...|$|R

In this paper, emerging zoonotic diseases are newly introduced disease agents or endemic zoonoses whose previous epidemiologic patterns have changed. As of 1996, 15 zoonotic diseases of animals, anthrax, brucellosis, cysticercosis (bovine), erysipelas, leishmaniasis (canine), leptospirosis, listeriosis, malleus (glanders), psittacosis (chlamydiasis), Q fever, rabies, Rift Valley fever (RVF), salmonellosis, trichinosis, and <b>tuberculosis</b> (<b>bovine</b> and avian) (Table 1), have been declared notifiable in Israel. When diagnosed in animals, these diseases are officially reported to the state veterinary officers, who in turn report them to the medical officers. Of these notifiable zoonoses, RVF has never been recorded in Israel, and glanders has not been reported since 1951; ten are notifiable in humans at the national level. This article examines five of the reportable animal diseases whose epidemiologic features have changed in Israel during the last decade: Brucella melitensis in cattle, Salmonella enteritidis in poultry, rabies, canine leishmaniasis, and trichinosis in wild boars. Two nonreportable diseases in animals—botulism in ruminants and echinococcosis—will also be discussed briefly. (Table 1).

Protective cellular immune responses can be preferentially induced when antigens are displayed on small particles. In this study, Escherichia coli and Lactococcus lactis were engineered to produce spherical polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) inclusions which displayed a fusion protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, antigen 85 A (Ag 85 A) –early secreted antigenic target 6 -kDa protein (ESAT- 6). L. lactis was chosen as a possible production host due its extensive use in the food industry and reduced risk of lipopolysaccharide contamination. Mice were vaccinated with PHB bead vaccines with or without displaying Ag 85 A–ESAT- 6, recombinant Ag 85 A–ESAT- 6, or M. bovis BCG. Separate groups of mice were used to measure immune responses and assess protection against an aerosol M. bovis challenge. Increased amounts of antigen-specific gamma interferon, interleukin- 17 A (IL- 17 A), IL- 6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were produced from splenocytes postvaccination, but no or minimal IL- 4, IL- 5, or IL- 10 was produced, indicating Th 1 - and Th 17 -biased T cell responses. Decreased lung bacterial counts and less extensive foci of inflammation were observed in lungs of mice receiving BCG or PHB bead vaccines displaying Ag 85 A–ESAT- 6 produced in either E. coli or L. lactis compared to those observed in the lungs of phosphate-buffered saline-treated control mice. No differences between those receiving wild-type PHB beads and those receiving recombinant Ag 85 A–ESAT- 6 were observed.

Para baixa cobertura vacinal, da ordem de 30 %, o tempo para reduzir a prevalência a 2 %, valor adotado como referência, pode ser longo, aproximando-se do dobro do tempo necessário para uma cobertura mais alta, de 90 %. De acordo com o modelo, o tempo para reduzir a prevalência a 1 % ou 2 %, que permitam passar à fase de erradicação, pode chegar a uma década. Recomenda-se a intensificação do esforço para a vacinação de fêmeas, procurando atingir alta cobertura vacinal. Due to the {{important}} role played by female bovines in the transmission and maintenance of brucellosis, they were {{the target of the}} serological surveys of the Brazilian National Program for the Control and Eradication of <b>Bovine</b> Brucellosis and <b>Tuberculosis.</b> Based on the information obtained in Brazilian states, where the serological surveys were carried out and prevalences higher than 2 % were observed, a model to simulate the dynamics of brucellosis in herds of female bovines was developed to analyze the effects of vaccination strategies. For low vaccination coverage (around 30 %), the time to reduce the prevalence to 2 %, adopted as a reference, may be long, approximately twice as long as the time observed for a higher coverage (90 %). According to the model, the time to reduce the prevalence to levels of 1 % or 2 %, adequate to start the eradication phase, may reach a decade. It is recommended an intensification of the effort to vaccinate females, aiming at attaining high vaccination coverage...|$|R
