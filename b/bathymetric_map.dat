In {{the first part of the}} thesis are described methods used for shoreline mapping and possibilities of depth measurements. In the theoretical part are also described interpolation methods which could be applied on point datasets. At first is given general description of these methods and after that follows also the detailed description of these methods in ArcGIS. Next part of the thesis describes cartographic methods used in bathymetry and in this part are also evaluated current <b>bathymetric</b> <b>maps.</b> The main discussion in this part is regarding cartographic and geoinformatic methods used in the process of creation these maps. In the last part is suggested a new attitude in this process and there are also created <b>bathymetric</b> <b>maps</b> using new combination of cartographic methods. These maps are enclosed at the end of the thesis. Key words: bathymetry, map, gis, cartography, interpolatio...|$|R

40|$|<b>Bathymetric</b> <b>maps</b> {{produced}} from remotely sensed imagery are increasingly common. However, when {{this method is}} applied to fluvial environments, changing scenes and illumination variations severely hinder the application of well established empirical calibration methods used to obtain predictive depth-colour relationships. In this paper, illumination variations are corrected with feature based image processing, {{which is used to}} identify areas in an image with a near-zero water depth. This information can then be included in the depth-colour calibration process, which results in an improved prediction quality.

Penetration of multispectral bands gives benefits to identification of sea bottom morphology {{which could be}} improved by <b>bathymetric</b> <b>mapping.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} is to improve methodology of the sea bottom morphology and <b>bathymetric</b> <b>mapping</b> using Worldview- 2 imagery. Sea bottom morphology mapping can also assist identification of benthic habitat in the shallow water. The approach of this study is by using several image transformations assisted by depth in situ measurement.

Smith, P. Paron and J. Griffiths, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 507 - 532. The availability of new geomatics technologies and methods {{has transformed the}} investigation of sediment transport rates using the morphological approach. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), in particular, has transformative potential for mapping river change in braided rivers since much of the bed is sub-aerially exposed at low flows. TLS offers the opportunity to collect high-precision and high-accuracy data over large spatial extents, at temporal frequencies commensurate with individual flood events. When coupled with a suitable <b>bathymetric</b> <b>mapping</b> technique, high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) can be developed for {{both dry and wet}} areas of the braidplain. This chapter presents results from the ReesScan Project, where a methodology has been developed to apply TLS and empirical?optical <b>bathymetric</b> <b>mapping</b> to monitor the evolution of the braided Rees River, New Zealand, through a sequence of competent flood events. A reach-scale sediment budget is calculated and subjected to a statistical method to estimate a threshold level of detection to distinguish spurious changes in the DEM of difference. Tests at all the confidence levels considered (84 %? 99 %) show that the reach is aggrading, with deposition volumes exceeding erosion volumes by 9 % for the 84 % confidence interval. This equated to a mean aggradation rate of 11 mm. The DEM of difference is rich in detail and, even when subjected to stringent statistical testing, subtle geomorphological changes are evident. The results show that the coupling of TLS with empirical?optical <b>bathymetric</b> <b>mapping</b> is a compelling approach for quantifying topographic change in unprecedented detail...|$|R
