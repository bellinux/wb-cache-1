5|$|The TsKB-17 design bureau {{proposed}} {{variants of}} the design with both cruise and <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles.</b> The <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> would have been launched from vertical tubes replacing the forward turrets, and in one version, the entire main armament. The proposal was dropped because both types would have needed a fully stabilized launching platform to give them any chance of hitting their targets and that the <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> would need three hours of preparation time.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} World War II Germany {{introduced}} the V-1 cruise missile and V-2 <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> in combat against the Allied forces. The missiles arrived too late to alter {{the course of the}} war, but after the fall of Nazi Germany the V-1 and V-2 rockets would form the foundations for the space race and for the policy of Mutually Assured Destruction by providing each superpower with <b>Ballistic</b> <b>Missiles</b> and Submarine Launched <b>Ballistic</b> <b>Missiles</b> that could carry nuclear warheads.|$|E
5|$|Deurne {{airfield}} was to {{be destroyed}} by Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG 77). Antwerp housed the largest Allied contingent of nine Squadrons.

5|$|STRAT-X, or Strategic-Experimental, was a U.S. government-sponsored study {{conducted}} during 1966 and 1967 that comprehensively analyzed the potential {{future of the}} U.S. nuclear deterrent force. At the time, the Soviet Union was making significant strides in nuclear weapons delivery, and also constructing anti-ballistic missile defenses to protect strategic facilities. To address a potential technological {{gap between the two}} superpowers, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara entrusted the classified STRAT-X study to the Institute for Defense Analyses, which compiled a twenty-volume report in nine months. The report looked into more than one hundred different weapons systems, ultimately resulting in the MGM-134 Midgetman and LGM-118 Peacekeeper intercontinental <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles,</b> the s, and the Trident submarine-launched <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles,</b> among others. Journalists have regarded STRAT-X as a major influence on the course of U.S. nuclear policy.|$|E
5|$|Although {{of little}} {{strategic}} value and undamaged {{during the early}} stages of World War II, {{in the final stages of}} the war a number of V-1 flying bombs and V-2 <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> struck the area. The worst attack occurred in February 1945, when a V-2 struck Westbeech Road, killing 17 and injuring 68. The bombsites were redeveloped with housing in then-current styles, rather than to Plumbe and Earle's designs.|$|E

5|$|With the {{background}} of a buildup in tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States, and the deployment of Soviet RSD-10 Pioneer <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> targeting Western Europe, NATO decided, under the impetus of the Carter presidency, to deploy MGM-31 Pershing and cruise missiles in Europe, primarily West Germany. This deployment would have placed missiles just 10minutes' striking distance from Moscow.|$|E
5|$|An {{operation}} is {{launched by the}} task force {{to take back the}} site from Zakhaev’s forces via halo jump. However, Zakhaev promptly launches nuclear intercontinental <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> at the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, with the potential of causing 41 million casualties. The SAS and Force Recon, however, manage to breach the facility, seize the command room and remotely destroy the missiles over the Atlantic Ocean. They escape in military trucks with Zakhaev's forces in hot pursuit.|$|E
5|$|In the film, Stromberg's {{scheme to}} destroy {{civilisation}} by capturing Soviet and British nuclear submarines {{and have them}} fire intercontinental <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> at two major cities is actually a recycled plot from Gilbert's previous Bond film, You Only Live Twice, which involved stealing space capsules to start a war between the Soviets and the Americans. The similarity was apparent in the climax; both films involved an assault on a heavily fortified enemy that had taken refuge behind steel shutters.|$|E

5|$|Novikov was {{released}} six years into his sentence following Stalin's death on June 29, 1953, and reinstated as Chief Marshal of Aviation, {{where he was}} able to put his ideas into practice. A plan for using newly available jet aircraft and nuclear weapons to wage a possible future war with the United States was laid out by Novikov and shown to Nikita Khrushchev, who turned the proposal down in favor of <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{with the}} {{implementation}} of the Dnestr space surveillance units, {{a modified version of the}} original Dnestr units, Dnestr-M radar, was being developed to act as an early warning radar to identify attacks by <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles.</b> The first two were built at Murmansk in northern Russia (Olenegorsk – RO-1) and near Riga in the then Latvian SSR (Skrunda – RO-2). They constituted the beginning of the Soviet SPRN network, the equivalent of the NATO BMEWS.|$|E
5|$|The Army {{contacted}} the Johns Hopkins University Operations Research Office (ORO) {{to consider the}} task of shooting down <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> using a Nike-like system. The ORO report took three years to complete, and the resulting The Defense of the United States Against Aircraft and Missiles was comprehensive. While this study was still progressing, in February 1955 the Army began initial talks with Bell, and in March they contracted Bell's Nike team to begin a detailed 18-month study of the problem under the name Nike II.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper, {{in view of}} the {{important}} role of <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> motion state tracking in anti-missile combat, analyzes the research status. Combined with the current research achievements, according to the precessional motion state of <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> midcourse, this paper researches and establishes its dynamic model and the precessional motion model based on Euler angle representation. Finally, based on the three-dimensional model of <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> motion, it conducts simulation and verification. The research result has a certain reference significance for target recognition of <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> midcourse...|$|R
5|$|To limit {{development}} costs, {{the program}} shared engine development with the North American XB-70 Valkyrie strategic bomber program, {{and used a}} number of elements of earlier interceptor projects. The program had progressed {{only as far as}} the construction of a single wooden mockup when it was cancelled in 1959, due to a shortage of funds and the Soviets' adoption of <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> as their primary means of nuclear attack. Had it flown, the F-108 would have been the heaviest fighter of its era.|$|E
5|$|In early 1950, Saville {{served on}} the Guided Missiles Interdepartmental Operational Requirements Group (GMIORG), a {{military}} and civilian committee tasked with the coordination of research on guided missiles, {{as well as the}} development of tactics and overall strategy. In his role as USAF Deputy Chief of Staff for Development, Saville helped direct missile work, but soon replaced himself on the GMIORG with Major General Robert M. Lee, commander of TAC. Saville was more interested in air-to-air guided missiles than in ground-based <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles,</b> which became the focus of the committee.|$|E
5|$|Kalam {{was invited}} by Raja Ramanna {{to witness the}} country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the {{representative}} of TBRL, {{even though he had}} not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> from the technology of the successful SLV programme. Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship. Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace projects.|$|E
25|$|The Indian <b>Ballistic</b> <b>Missile</b> Defence Programme is an {{initiative}} {{to develop and}} deploy a multi-layered <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> defence system to protect India from <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> attacks. It is a double-tiered system consisting of two interceptor missiles, namely the Prithvi Air Defence (PAD) missile for high altitude interception, and the Advanced Air Defence (AAD) Missile for lower altitude interception.|$|R

50|$|Along {{with the}} reassertion of {{civilian}} control over {{the military and the}} return to military duties came a shift of resources away from the defense sector. Defense procurement dropped by 20 percent in 1971 and shifted from aircraft production and intercontinental <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> development to the modernization of the ground forces and medium-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> and intermediate-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> development.|$|R
5|$|The British {{information}} gathering vessel St Georges, {{which holds}} the Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator (ATAC), the system {{used by the}} Ministry of Defence to communicate with and co-ordinate the Royal Navy's fleet of Polaris submarines, is sunk after accidentally trawling an old naval mine in the Ionian Sea. MI6 agent James Bond is ordered by the Minister of Defence, Sir Frederick Gray and MI6 Chief of Staff, Bill Tanner, to retrieve the ATAC before the Soviets, as the transmitter could order attacks by the submarines' Polaris <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Project E {{nuclear warheads}} {{were also used}} on the sixty Thor Intermediate Range <b>Ballistic</b> <b>Missiles</b> which were {{operated}} by the RAF from 1959 to 1963 under Project Emily. The British Army acquired Project E warheads for its Corporal missiles in 1958. The United States subsequently offered the Honest John missile as an interim replacement, and it remained in service until 1977, when it was in turn superseded by the Lance missile. Eight-inch and 155mm nuclear artillery rounds were also acquired under Project E. A maritime version of Project E known as Project N provided nuclear depth bombs used by the RAF Coastal Command. The last Project E weapons were withdrawn from service in 1992.|$|E
5|$|The Ohio {{class was}} {{designed}} in the 1970s to carry the concurrently-designed Trident submarine-launched ballistic missile. Both variants of the Tridents—the UGM-96 Trident I and the UGM-133 Trident II—are propelled by three-stage solid propellant rockets and are equipped with 8–14 nuclear warheads. The 73,000lb (33,100kg) UGM-96, {{with a range of}} 4,000mi (6,400km), served from October 1979, starting with the Benjamin Franklin-class USS Francis Scott Key, until 2006. The 130,000lb (59,000kg) UGM-133, with a range of 6,000mi (9,700km), is in service , having been introduced in 1990 with USS Tennessee. The primary self-defense weapon of the class is the Mk 48 ADCAP torpedo. Ohio-class submarines that carry <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> receive orders from the United States Strategic Command based in Nebraska.|$|E
