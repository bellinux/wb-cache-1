2500|$|Conversely, modern {{biological}} sciences (including even {{concepts such as}} molecular ecology) are intimately entwined and heavily dependent on the methods developed through biotechnology and what is commonly {{thought of as the}} life sciences industry. [...] Biotechnology is the research and development in the laboratory using bioinformatics for exploration, extraction, exploitation and production from any living organisms and any source of biomass by means of <b>biochemical</b> <b>engineering</b> where high value-added products could be planned (reproduced by biosynthesis, for example), forecasted, formulated, developed, manufactured, and marketed for the purpose of sustainable operations (for the return from bottomless initial investment on R & D) and gaining durable patents rights (for exclusives rights for sales, and prior to this to receive national and international approval from the results on animal experiment and human experiment, especially on the pharmaceutical branch of biotechnology to prevent any undetected side-effects or safety concerns by using the products).|$|E
2500|$|By the 1940s, {{it became}} clear that unit {{operations}} alone were insufficient in developing chemical reactors. While the predominance of unit operations in chemical engineering courses in Britain and the United States continued until the 1960s, transport phenomena started to experience greater focus. Along with other novel concepts, such process systems engineering (PSE), a [...] "second paradigm" [...] was defined. Transport phenomena gave an analytical approach to chemical engineering while PSE focused on its synthetic elements, such as control system and process design. Developments in chemical engineering before and after World War II were mainly incited by the petrochemical industry, however, advances in other fields were made as well. Advancements in <b>biochemical</b> <b>engineering</b> in the 1940s, for example, found application in the pharmaceutical industry, and allowed for the mass production of various antibiotics, including penicillin and streptomycin.

30|$|In fact, {{hydrogen}} production by C. reinhardtii can still {{not meet the}} commercial requirement because of several <b>biochemical</b> and <b>engineering</b> shortcomings, for example, {{hydrogen production}} demands anoxia because oxygen can suppress transcription and function of hydrogenase(s). However, the anoxia is constrained by {{the function of the}} photosystem II (PSII), which provides electron and protons from water and conducts oxygen evolution in the photosynthetic electron transport chain. Economic assessments have suggested that microalgae should achieve an efficiency of 10 % in the conversion of solar energy to bioenergy to be competitive with other H 2 production methods, such as biomass gasification or photovoltaic electrolysis [117]. This is a more than a fivefold increase in efficiency from current levels. Exploiting hydrogen production directly in a product-type MFC may help to bridge this gap.|$|R

40|$|Birhythmicity {{occurs in}} many natural and {{artificial}} systems. In this {{paper we propose}} a self-feedback scheme to control birhythmicity. To establish the efficacy and generality of the proposed control scheme, we apply it on three birhythmic oscillators from diverse fields of natural science, namely, an energy harvesting system, the p 53 -Mdm 2 network for protein genesis (the OAK model) and a glycolysis model (modified Decroly-Goldbeter model). Using the harmonic decomposition technique and energy balance method we derive the analytical conditions for the control of birhythmicity. A detailed numerical bifurcation analysis in the parameter space establishes that the control scheme is capable of eliminating birhythmicity and it can also induce transitions between different forms of bistability. As the proposed control scheme is quite general, it can be applied for control of several real systems, particularly in <b>biochemical</b> and <b>engineering</b> systems.
