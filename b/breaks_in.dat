5|$|Playing with a {{tonsillar}} infection {{for most}} of the season, Gardiner was often slumped over his crossbar during <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> games, nearly blacking out. After leaving for a singing lesson in June 1934, Gardiner, a baritone, collapsed. He went into a coma, from which he never woke. Gardiner died at age 29, on Wednesday, June 13, 1934, from a brain hemorrhage brought on by the infection.|$|E

5|$|Topoisomerases {{introduce}} both single- and double-strand <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> {{the course}} of changing the DNA's state of supercoiling, which is especially common in regions near an open replication fork. Such breaks are not considered DNA damage because they are a natural intermediate in the topoisomerase biochemical mechanism and are immediately repaired by the enzymes that created them.|$|E

The ship <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> half, lifting the stern into the air. Jack and Rose ride it into the ocean and he helps her onto a wooden panel only buoyant enough for one person. He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. Jack dies of hypothermia but Rose is saved.|$|E
5|$|At the Crucible O'Sullivan {{defeated}} Marcus Campbell in {{the last}} 32, Ali Carter {{in the last}} 16, Stuart Bingham in the quarter-finals. He reached the final without falling behind even once, and defeated Barry Hawkins 18–12 to win his fifth world title. O'Sullivan's break of 103 in the 15th frame was his 128th century break at the Crucible Theatre, breaking Stephen Hendry's record of 127 Crucible centuries. During the final he extended the record to 131 century breaks. O'Sullivan became the only player to score six century <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> a World Championship final. He also became only the third player to retain his title at the Crucible after Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being set}} in Yorkshire, the {{majority}} of location filming was moved to Buckinghamshire, although Levisham railway station {{and the surrounding area}} in North Yorkshire were used. The location shooting of the film began on 18 August 1986, at St. Mary's church in Radnage. Filming was periodically hindered by inclement weather – the perfect summer in which the book was set was not forthcoming, and scenes were filmed during <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> heavy rain. Interiors were shot at Bray Studios in Berkshire.|$|E
5|$|HIV-1 {{infection}} causes chronic ongoing {{inflammation and}} production of reactive oxygen species. Thus, the HIV genome may be vulnerable to oxidative damages, including <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> the single-stranded RNA. For HIV, {{as well as for}} viruses generally, successful infection depends on overcoming host defensive strategies that often include production of genome-damaging reactive oxygen. Thus, Michod et al. suggested that recombination by viruses is an adaptation for repair of genome damages, and that recombinational variation is a byproduct that may provide a separate benefit.|$|E

5|$|In February 2010, President Obama {{formed the}} {{bipartisan}} BowlesSimpson Commission to recommend steps {{that could be}} taken to reduce future budget deficits. The commission released its report on November 10, 2010, which recommended deep domestic and military spending cuts, reforming the tax system by eliminating many tax <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> return for lower overall rates, and reducing benefits for Social Security and Medicare. The plan did not receive the supermajority vote within the commission which {{it needed to be}} directly sent to Congress, and portions of the plan were rejected by both parties.|$|E

5|$|Robert DeLeo, against Atlantic Records' wishes, {{insisted that}} he and his brother Dean DeLeo produce the record themselves, which began {{production}} in early 2009. Because recording took place during <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> the band's touring schedule, production took nearly ten months to complete. Three studios were used simultaneously, including Robert's home studio and Eric Kretz's Bomb Shelter Studios. Scott Weiland recorded vocals at his own Lavish Studios. Don Was was brought in as an additional producer to help keep the band's separate recording sessions in sync, as well as to work closely with Weiland during the recording of his vocals. The album was completed in December 2009, and mixing and mastering were finished by February 2010.|$|E

The essential mechanism causing the dynamical <b>breaking</b> is explained <b>in</b> the review of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model.

The match-tiebreak decided {{the outcome of the}} final, with Mirnyi and Ram winning the tiebreak and the match. It was Mirnyi's 36th and Ram's 16th men's doubles title of the career and their second title as a team.|$|E

5|$|The Holliday {{junction}} {{is a key}} intermediate in homologous recombination, {{a biological}} process that increases genetic diversity by shifting genes between two chromosomes, as well as site-specific recombination events involving integrases. They are additionally involved in repair of double-strand <b>breaks.</b> <b>In</b> addition, cruciform structures involving Holliday junctions can arise to relieve helical strain in symmetrical sequences in DNA supercoils. While four-arm junctions also appear in functional RNA molecules, such as U1 spliceosomal RNA and the hairpin ribozyme of the tobacco ringspot virus, these usually contain unpaired nucleotides in between the paired double-helical domains, and thus do not strictly adopt the Holliday structure.|$|E

5|$|The {{holes in}} the cuticle which allow for this {{digestive}} mechanism pose a challenge for the plant, since they serve as <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> the cuticle (waxy layer) that protects the plant from desiccation. As a result, P. moranensis is usually found in relatively humid environments. The production of the stalked capture glands and sessile digestive glands is also costly. A {{recent study found that}} the density of these respective glands can be correlated to environmental gradients. For example, capture gland density was found to be highest where prey availability was low, whereas digestive glands density showed direct correlation to prey availability. These results suggest that the amount of investment in carnivorous features is an adaptation to the environmental gradients.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountain}} {{is also home}} to several bogs, which exist as <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> the cloud forests. It is believed that bogs form in low-lying areas where clay in the soil prevents proper water drainage, resulting in an accumulation of water that impedes the root systems of woody plants. Kohala's bogs are characterized by sedges, mosses of the genus Sphagnum, and oha wai, native members of the bellflower family. Other habitats include rain forest and mesophytic (wet) forests.|$|E
