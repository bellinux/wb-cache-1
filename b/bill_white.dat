5|$|The Aeroplane Jelly jingle was {{composed}} by Albert Francis Lenertz (1891–1943), Appleroth's business partner. The jingle was a re-working of Lenertz's earlier political jingle {{in tribute to}} Australian Prime Minister William Morris Hughes. A minor controversy occurred in the Sydney Morning Herald in 1988 over authorship of the song, with claims made on behalf of vaudeville actress Peggy Thorne, pianist of the Musician's Lodge, Les Woods, and New Zealander <b>Bill</b> <b>White.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} duck have brown-plumaged females {{that can be}} {{confused}} with the female mallard. The female gadwall (A.strepera) has an orange-lined <b>bill,</b> <b>white</b> belly, black and white speculum that is seen as a white square on the wings in flight, and is a smaller bird. More similar to the female mallard in North America are the American black duck (A.rubripes), which is notably darker-hued in both sexes than the mallard, and the mottled duck (A.fulvigula), which is somewhat darker than the female mallard, and with slightly different bare-part colouration and no white edge on the speculum.|$|E
5|$|Since Nintendo did {{not have}} many products, it made only a few {{commercials}} a year, meaning the quality had to be phenomenal.

One of the first commercials made under <b>Bill</b> <b>White,</b> director of advertising and public relations, was the market introduction for the Legend of Zelda, which received {{a great deal of attention}} in the ad industry. In it, a wiry-haired, nerdy guy (John Kassir) walks through the dark making goofy noises, yelling out the names of some enemies from the game, and screaming for Zelda.|$|E

5|$|The City of Houston {{operates}} the Southwest Multi-Service Center within the Greater Sharpstown district, adjacent to Gulfton. The city's multi-service centers provide child care, elderly residents programs, and rental space. The complex includes the Houston Public Library (HPL) Express Southwest library extension. The center also houses the Mayor's Office for Immigrant and Refugee Affairs and the Mayor's Citizens' Assistance Office (CAO) Southwest Satellite Office.

40|$|I {{would like}} to thank Governor Noyer and the Banque de France for organising this {{stimulating}} conference on globalisation, inflation and monetary policy. With strong global growth boosting oil, food and materials prices, the linkages between globalisation and domestic inflation –one focus of <b>Bill</b> <b>White’s</b> interesting paper – are very much on the minds of monetary policymakers these days. I will return to this development as I conclude my remarks. <b>Bill</b> <b>White’s</b> paper is an ambitious attempt to identify the main factors responsible for the decline in global inflation since the 1970 s and the persistence of low global inflation in recent years.

25|$|Nonetheless, in 1970–71 NHL season, {{life was}} made easier for Chicago, as {{in an attempt}} to better balance the divisions, the {{expansion}} Buffalo Sabres and Vancouver Canucks were both placed in the East Division, while the Hawks moved into the West Division. They became the class of the West overnight, rampaging to a 46–17–15 record and an easy first-place finish. With second-year goalie Tony Esposito (Phil's younger brother and winner of the Calder Memorial Trophy for Rookie of the Year the previous season), Hull, his younger brother Dennis, Mikita, and sterling defensemen Stapleton, Keith Magnuson and <b>Bill</b> <b>White,</b> the Hawks reached the Stanley Cup final before bowing out to the Canadiens.|$|E
25|$|The 1977 World Series {{marked the}} first time that the {{participating}} teams' local announcers were not featured as booth announcers on the network telecast of a World Series. 1977 was also the first year in which one announcer (in this case, ABC's Keith Jackson) provided all of the play-by-play for a World Series telecast. In previous years, the play-by-play announcers and color commentators had alternated roles during each game. Meanwhile, Yankees announcer <b>Bill</b> <b>White</b> and Dodgers announcer Ross Porter alternated between pregame/postgame duties on ABC and calling the games for CBS Radio. White worked the ABC telecasts for the games in New York (including the clubhouse trophy presentation ceremony after Game 6) while Porter did likewise for the games in Los Angeles.|$|E

As of 2006 {{the police station}} has a captain and 74 patrol and supervisor police officers. <b>Bill</b> <b>White,</b> Mayor of Houston in 2006, said that Kingwood had fair police services. Of the communities of Houston, Kingwood has the lowest number of police officers {{in relation to the}} overall number of crimes committed in the city. White also said that he received requests to remove police officers from Kingwood and place them in areas of Houston with higher crime rates. White said that he refused the requests since the removal would impact response times in Kingwood, the worst in the city. Prior to annexation, the Harris County Precinct 4 Constable provided law enforcement services.|$|E

25|$|Building {{on their}} late-season pennant run in 1963, the 1964 Cardinals {{developed}} a strong camaraderie that was noted for being {{free of the}} racial tension that predominated in the United States at that time. Part of this atmosphere stemmed from {{the integration of the}} team's spring training hotel in 1960, and Gibson and teammate <b>Bill</b> <b>White</b> worked to confront and stop use of racial slurs within the team. On August 23, the Cardinals were 11 games behind the Philadelphia Phillies and remained six-and-a-half games behind on September 21. The combination of a nine-game Cardinals winning streak and a ten-game Phillies losing streak then brought the season down to the final game. The Cardinals faced the New York Mets, and Gibson entered the game as a relief pitcher in the fifth inning. Aware that the Phillies were ahead of the Cincinnati Reds 4–0 at the time he entered the game, Gibson proceeded to pitch four innings of two-hit relief, while his teammates scored 11 runs of support to earn the victory.|$|E
