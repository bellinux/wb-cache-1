40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Invasive {{insects and}} pathogens, climate change, and {{anthropogenic}} factors are causing broad-scale change in forest ecosystems. Identifying, understanding, and maintaining historic and functioning ecosystems in changing landscapes {{can be challenging}} because multiple internal and external factors interact across scales. In this dissertation, I present a hierarchical approach to investigate patterns of health and mortality of subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook) Nutt. var. lasiocarpa) associated with a non-native herbivorous insect, the balsam woolly adelgid (BWA), Adelges piceae Ratzeburg, and landscape disturbance on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington, U. S. A. Assessment across broad and fine spatial and temporal scales allowed the identification of distinct boundaries of change associated with climate, topography, vegetation, and disturbance processes of fire, winter weather events, mass movement, and endemic and introduced insects and pathogens. I used Landsat imagery at broad spatial and temporal scales to differentiate patterns of very-high-, high-, and low-magnitude disturbance in subalpine-fir forest using the normalized burn ratio (NBR). Low-magnitude decline in NBR gradually increased in area over time (1994 - 2007) and occurred predominantly at high elevations and southern aspects during years of warm PDO index values, suggesting interactive effects of an invasive <b>biotic</b> <b>agent</b> and climate. I conducted field studies that identified BWA as the <b>biotic</b> <b>agent</b> that was consistently present in affected areas and associated with poor health and mortality of subalpine fir. Using dendrochronology, I determined that variability {{in the growth of}} subalpine fir was positively associated with the arrival of BWA in a forest along Hurricane Ridge in Olympic National Park. I compared aerial detection surveys, Landsat imagery, and dendrochronology methods and confirmed that all three methods independently detected effects of BWA for the same time period. These methods provided a more complete assessment {{that would not have been}} possible with one method alone. This dissertation demonstrates the utility of a hierarchical approach that combines remote sensing and field validation to detect patterns of disturbance and identify potential fine- and broad-scale causal mechanisms of forest change...|$|E

40|$|Important {{roles for}} <b>biotic</b> <b>agents</b> in {{integrated}} weed management include preventing seed production and weed emergence from the seed bank. Seed-attacking microorganisms {{have been described}} for {{a limited number of}} economically important weeds and serve as examples illustrating the potential for reducing weed seed production. Innundative releas-es of seed-feeding insects have also successfully reduced viable seeds produced by spe-cific weeds and subsequently reduced the viable weed seed content in soils. There are some indications that seed attacked by either microorganisms or insects carry over detri-mental effects in soil and result in reduced weed seedling emergence in the following growing seasons. Combinations of different <b>biotic</b> <b>agents</b> could enhance efficacy of weed management over that observed with either agent alone. For example, a selective seed-feeding insect, Niesthrea louisianica, combined with seed-attacking fungi (Fusarium spp.) significantly decreased velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti) seed viability and seedling emergence compared to either the insect or fungi alone. Insect-attacked, fungal-infected velvetleaf seeds survived at very low rates in soil (ca. 2 % viable seeds at 24 months.) and in plots where the seedbank was not replenished, no viable seeds were retrieved from soil after 24 months. Integration of compatible <b>biotic</b> <b>agents</b> can be an effective method for reducing seed viability before and after entry into the seed bank. Prevention of seed pro-duction is considered the foundation for successful weed management — effective insect + microorganism combinations are key in building this foundation in biologically-based weed management...|$|R

40|$|Summary: Many cabbage trees (Cordyline australis) {{are dying}} {{throughout}} much of the North Island and the northern South Island of New Zealand. The symptomatology of those dying in urban environments is described, and is concluded to be consistent with the hypothesis that death is caused by a <b>biotic</b> <b>agent</b> entering through a leafy tuft of the branch system. This disease, which has been named Sudden Decline, usually leads to almost total defoliation of affected trees within 2 - 12 months. Disease incidence has increased linearly at about 11 % per annum since 1987 / 88. Cultivated trees of C. kaspar, C. obtecta, and various Cordyline hybrids have also been observed dying with Sudden Decline symptoms. Investigations aimed at identifying the causal agent are described, and the hypothesis is advanced that a phytoplasma (mycoplasma-like organism or MLO) is the cause. Sudden Decline is contrasted with the widespread ill-health apparent in many pastoral populations of cabbage tree throughout the country. This Rural Decline is characterised by a general loss of branch and leaf vigour and occasional tree death. It is suggested that Rural Decline is a complex disease (decline disease) caused by various biotic and abiotic agents interacting with an ageing population growing in situations where regeneration is prevented. In many pastoral situations Sudden Decline is superimposed on Rural Decline. The ecological implications of Sudden Decline are discussed...|$|E

It’s occurence in Mediterranean has been registered and reported by several authors. The {{aim of this}} paper is to contribute to the comprehension on the aethiology of this syndrome which is causing significant losses in one year old cultured fish. Different types of commercial diets were introduced during 1994 / 95 rearing season to the sea bream reared in floating cages. The feeds were displaying differences in energetic compound level and vitamin A, D 3 and E content. Health difficulties and mortality in the observed fish groups at the beginning of the problem, did not indicate any <b>biotic</b> <b>agent</b> as being responsible for such condition. Clinical features and mortality in the groups affected by winter disease syndrome were increasing by low sea temperature and correlating with feeding period by food containing low levels of protein, lipids and vitamins.

Growth rate was characteristic for the group that were suffering winter disease, where increasing in length was not followed by body weight. Clinical signs, simptomathology related to the organs involved in digestion, liver histology analyses, weight losses and pattern of weight and length relation, correlation between used feeds and occurrence of winter disease, implicated nutrition as one of most possible ethiological agent of this condition. Nutritional interventions applied contributed in comprehension of the winter disease syndrome.

40|$|A {{soil and}} foliar {{nutrient}} analysis {{was carried out}} in the Hawaiian Metrosideros rain forest for the purposes of elucidating a previously published physical habitat classification and for finding an explanation for the widespread canopy dieback, which is not caused by a <b>biotic</b> <b>agent</b> in this ecosystem. Soil elements analyzed were C, N, P, Ca, AI, Mn, Fe, and other parameters such as pH. Foliar analysis was restricted to N, P, Ca, Mn, and Fe and assessed only for the canopy M. polymorpha and its major associate, the tree ferns, in the undergrowth. It was found that the earlier recognized two-way breakdown into oligotrophic and eutrophic nutrient regimes had to be enlarged for the habitat classification to a mesotrophic category. Young, deep-ash soils were recognized as mesotrophic on account of their moderate pH and high Ca levels, but they showed severe limitations in available nitrogen and phosphorus that were reflected also in the foliage. Intermediate-aged (1000 yr) ash soils were found to be nutritionally well supplied and balanced and thus considered eutrophic, while older ash soils were designated as oligotrophic on account oftheir extreme acidity and associated higher and potentially toxic levels of soluble AI, Mn, and Fe. Except for the mesotrophic 'a'a lava site, other shallow rock outcrop habitats on pahoehoe were recognized as oligotrophic, because of very low available N and high acidity and, in the poorly drained sites, also high levels of potentially toxic metals. The bog habitats had the highest levels of potentially toxic metals, but surprisingly moderate levels of available N and P. The canopy dieback phenomenon cannot be entirely explained from the nutrient imbalances found in most of the substrate types, but these imbalances are considered contributory {{in the sense that they}} become increasingly stressful with stand development, thereby decreasing tree vigor and predisposing stands to dieback...|$|E
40|$|Massive tree dieback has {{occurred}} periodically in the Hawaiian montane rain forest. The species mainly involved is Metrosideros polymorpha, {{which is the}} prevailing upper canopy tree species throughout most of this forest on all high Hawaiian islands. The canopy dieback occurs in stands over the entire spectrum of sites, from well-drained lava flows over nutritionally rich volcanic ash to permanently wet bogs with toxic soils. A <b>biotic</b> <b>agent</b> {{could not be found}} to cause this dieback. Five main dieback patterns have been recognized, and all are site-specific. These patterns suggest certain causal mechanisms, but they explain {{only a fraction of the}} dieback syndrome. A number of additional facts were established which have led to a new dieback theory involving a chain-reaction process: (1) cohort senescing as a predisposing factor; (2) a dieback trigger, which can be either internal (a species characteristic) or external (a fluctuating and recurring site-specific perturbation), and (3) a dieback hastening (biotic agents) or stalling mechanism. It is believed that the dieback phenomenon is not restricted to Hawaii but occurs also in other, functionally similar Pacific forests. A corollary to the Hawaiian dieback etiology is a new succession theory, which explains the temporally recurring dieback as a pattern and process sequence in primary succession. The larger dieback patterns are considered a consequence of catastrophic disturbances in the past, such as lava flows, ash blanket deposits, or landslides, which gave rise to large cohorts. Canopy dieback of these large cohorts during their senescing stage then gives rise to new cohorts. However, these become successively smaller and more patchy with each dieback cycle. Concomitantly with the dieback cycles a turnover of successional races or ecotypes appears to occur within the Metrosideros polymorpha species complex. This may allow us to determine pioneer, seral, and near-climax races within this species complex...|$|E

40|$|Factors {{relating}} to seedling establishment {{and the effects}} of selective logging on regeneration were investigated in a subtropical rainforest in south east Queensland, to determine the regeneration patterns of tree species. Along a 200 m long and 0. 5 m wide transect, litter movement and accumulation were studied. Although litter movement was detected in every month, the total amount of litter accumulated varied slightly during the present study, due to the comparable amount of litter moved out and moved in. A larger amount of litter movement was observed with a smaller probability of occurrence. In terms of frequency, a <b>biotic</b> <b>agent</b> (the foraging behaviour of vertebrates) and abiotic agents (rain, wind and topography) respectively contributed to half of the movement of litter on the ground. Nevertheless, in terms of mean amount of litter being moved in every event, vertebrates moved significantly more litter than did abiotic agents. The understorey vegetation of this forest was dominated by a fern species (Lastreopsis decomposita) with a canopy height of 30 - 40 cm. Lower light transmittance accompanied higher fern cover. The probability of being disturbed by vertebrates and covered by litter was significantly lower under the fern canopy than at the edge of fern canopy or in habitats without fern cover. The frequency of vertebrate disturbance and the amount of litter being moved in decreased as the extent of fern cover increased. In the 100 m 2 transect area, even though mean growth rate of seedlings was positively correlated with light availability of habitats, over 70 % of seedlings did not grow at all to their death or the end of the two-year study. Herbivory caused the largest proportion of seedling mortality (28. 2 %), followed by litter cover due to abiotic disturbance (27. 8 %), uprooting (15. 4 %), water stress (13. 0 %), vertebrate-induced litter cover (7. 9 %), pathogens (5. 8 %) and unknown agents (1. 9 %). Animals (herbivory, uprooting and vertebrate-induced litter cover) were responsible {{for more than half of}} seedling mortality. The effects of several factors on seedling survival were evaluated with survival analysis. The effects of herbivory, litter cover, light intensity, and litter thickness on seedling survival were not significant. Higher survival rates of seedlings were associated with greater initial height, older age and lower frequency of vertebrate disturbance. Due to a high risk of succumbing to animal disturbance, seedlings of three shrub species with woody or hard shoot structures had higher survival rates than did seedlings of canopy tree species. Understorey vegetation significantly reduced light availability and the risk of being damaged by vertebrate disturbance and litter cover. The negative effects of lower light availability were outweighed by the positive effects associated with reduced stress due to litter cover and vertebrate disturbance. As a result, seedlings in habitats with higher coverage of understorey vegetation had higher survival percentages. The 40 -year vegetation records of an unlogged and a logged forest stand were compared. The selective logging operation in 1961 reduced species richness by 36. 1 %, the number of stems >= 6 m in height by 60. 1 % and stem basal area in the community by 62. 7 %. Species richness and the number of stems recovered in ten years, and the vertical structure recovered in 40 years. Nonetheless, due to the removal of large DBH trees, it is predicted that the pre-logging basal area will not be regained within 20 to 60 years. Early successional species contributed a higher proportion of stems and basal area in the logged than in the unlogged plot. Forty years after logging, there was no significant difference in ground level light availability between the two plots, which was attributed to the dense understorey in the logged plot. For the first 30 years after logging, most individuals markedly grew faster in the logged than the unlogged plot, but in the last ten years, the situation of growth was reversed. This change was attributed to the marked reduction in growth of the smaller trees in the very dense understorey of the logged plot. The seedling study suggested there were two principal modes of regeneration establishment. Shrub species with low fecundity established seedling pools with high survivorship as a result of having woodier plant bodies. High fecundity is necessary for the establishment of seedlings of canopy tree species due to their non-durable characteristics. The study of the logging plots showed that different requirements for regeneration environments between early successional species and later successional species. Large-scale disturbances are needed for regeneration of early successional species, whilst later successional species can regenerate in smaller gaps. The prevailing natural disturbances which mainly create small canopy gaps will unilaterally facilitate the regeneration of the later successional species...|$|E

Applications of phytohormones (methyl salicylate and methyl jasmonate) and G. clavigera were used for initial induction of defenses. Monoterpene concentrations varied with initial induction from fungal and phytohormone application while watering treatment had no effect. Seedlings treated with G. clavigera and methyl jasmonate had the greatest monoterpene concentrations compared to the control and methyl salicylate-treated seedlings. However, the monoterpene response to the challenge inoculation varied with watering treatments, not with prior induction treatments, with lower monoterpene concentrations in fungal lesions on seedlings in the low to moderate watering treatments compared to normal watering treatment. Furthermore, prior induction from phytohormones resulted in systemic cross-induction of resistance to G. clavigera under normal watering treatment but susceptibility under low watering treatment. Seedlings stressed by low water conditions, which also had lower stomatal conductance than seedlings in the normal watering treatment, likely allocated resources to initial defense response but were left unable to acquire further resources for subsequent responses.

Relatively, less attention was paid on biotic factors involved in the fate of quinalphos in natural resources [23]. A definite participation of factors, in particular biotic factors, in the degradation of quinalphos in natural resources such as soil and water can only be demonstrated with the isolation of <b>biotic</b> <b>agents</b> with degradation traits from natural resources. Isolation of Ochrobactrum sp. strain HZM with biodegradation of quinalphos from pesticide-contaminated samples has been recently reported [23]. This organism degraded quinalphos by hydrolysis. Strains of Bacillus thuringiensis appeared to be <b>biotic</b> <b>agents</b> for degradation of fipronil and a wide range of pyrethroids in sugarcane fields [24] and an activated sludge [25]. In view of less understanding of biotic factors in quinalphos degradation, the current study is aimed at isolating bacterial species capable of degrading quinalphos from soil samples collected from horticultural fields and hitting the potential bacterium for assessment of various environmental factors on biodegradation of quinalphos in liquid culture conditions.|$|R
30|$|The {{impact of}} <b>biotic</b> <b>agents</b> is, however, {{expected}} to be spatially patchy (Dale et al. [2001]; Allen et al. [2010]). Density-dependent processes between the host organism and its attackers differ with local variations in soils and topography {{as well as with}} the physiological status of the host trees (Christiansen et al. [1987]; Allen et al. [2010]). Satellite-derived records of disturbance confirm that tree mortality is not uniformly distributed and that some of the variation can be attributed to differences in soil (Yoshiko and Mueller-Dombois [1995]; Brasier [1996]; Turner and Lambert [2005]; Bigler et al. [2006]; Hogg et al. [2008]; Harper et al. [2009]). In general, outbreaks are more prevalent on poorer quality sites and where there are large populations of overly-dense, older trees (Fettig et al. [2007]).|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} {{productivity of}} short-rotation plantation eucalypts and acacias in Asia requires ongoing {{investment in the}} biology of current and new genetics and constraints that climate change may impose. Understanding site fertility constraints {{has the potential to}} further lift productivity through precision application of inorganic fertilizers, management of beneficial bacteria and fungi and appropriate slash management. It remains a concern that nutrient disorders, especially micronutrients, which could be easily corrected in acid soils, are still being widely reported in the region. The low genetic diversity in many plantations heightens the risk of productivity loss due to incursions of pathogens and pests. In the past decade, a number of new biotic eucalypt threats have appeared within the region and are rapidly spreading. No plantation estate can be considered to be risk-free from such incursions. Furthermore, abiotic stresses (e. g. water, nutrients) are likely to exacerbate damage from <b>biotic</b> <b>agents.</b> With climate change, plantations established on marginal lands and sites with poor soils are likely to experience stresses that are more frequent and a more diverse group of stress agents than those in areas that are more resilient to climate change. Future breeding programs should include selection for tolerance to key abiotic and <b>biotic</b> stress <b>agents</b> that have the highest risk to plantation productivity...|$|R
40|$|In {{ecological}} communities, {{the proportion}} of plant species with different dispersal syndromes {{is known as the}} dispersal spectrum, which can result from different selective pressures such as climate. This is because variations in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure and precipitation result in distinct flora and fauna among different sites. If climate conditions along an altitudinal range act as a strong direct or indirect selective pressure on dispersal syndromes, the dispersal spectrum among plant communities in different altitudes should be distinct. We organized the dispersal syndromes in five hierarchical levels according to the levels of detail in diaspore morphology and, consequently, different degrees of specificity to the dispersers. Then we identified, within each hierarchical level, the syndromes of tree species of four forest types of the Atlantic Rainforest along a 1200 m altitudinal range in Southeast Brazil. Among 327 species, we found two syndromes in the most general hierarchical level (abiotic and biotic dispersal), three in the following level (wind, self and animal), three in the intermediate level (barochory, autochory and endozoochory), two in the forth level (mammal and bird), and 12 syndromes in the most specific level, all of which were related to the morphology of diaspores dispersed by wind, autochory, mammals and birds. The dispersal spectrum in the five hierarchical levels was similar among the four forest types. Overall, the majority of species is dispersed by <b>biotic</b> <b>agents,</b> considered here as animals and the parent plant itself. Within <b>biotic</b> <b>agents,</b> the most important are animals, specifically birds. Most bird-dispersed species present drupoid diaspores. Our results indicate that the selective pressures on dispersal syndromes originated from climate conditions that vary with altitude are not strong, hence resulting in the same dispersal spectrum among the forest types...|$|R

40|$|Global {{climate change}} is {{projected}} to producewarmer, longer, and more frequent droughts in many {{regions of the world}} (IPCC 2007) – referred to here and previously (Breshears et al. 2005) as “global change-type drought”. Such drought can trigger high rates of tree mor-tality along elevation gradients (Gitlin et al. 2006; van Mantgem and Stephenson 2007) and can even drive regional-scale tree mortality of dominant vegetation (Breshears et al. 2005; Allen 2007). Regional-scale die-off with such high rates of tree mortality will not only result in changes to vegetation structure, but will also impact land-surface interactions, land-surface stability, and ecosystem goods and services (MA 2005; NRC 2007). Notably, the relationship between the threshold for tree mortality and drought-induced water stress, which may also underlie the effects of <b>biotic</b> <b>agents</b> suc...|$|R

The investigations of recruit-ment of clonal taxa in different–sized gaps were conducted in the years 2011 – 2012 in Molinietum caeruleae meadows repre-senting various successional stages and dominated by different species. Patch ES, representing early-successional stage, was dominated by small meadow species, Patch MS, representing mid-successional stage, was prevailed by tall-growing macro-forbs, while Patch LS representing late-successional stage was overgrown by macroforbs and willows.
