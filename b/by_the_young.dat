5|$|Aarhus {{is known}} for its musical history. In the 1950s many jazz clubs sprang up around the city, fuelled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> population. By the 1960s, the music scene diversified into rock and other genres. In the 1970s and 1980s, Aarhus became the centre for Denmark's rock music {{fostering}} many iconic bands such as TV-2 and Gnags. Aarhus is home to the annual eight-day Aarhus International Jazz Festival, the SPoT Festival and the NorthSide Festival.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the First English Civil War Rupert was {{employed}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> King Louis XIV of France to fight the Spanish during the final years of the Thirty Years' War. Rupert's military employment was complicated by his promises to the Holy Roman Emperor that had led to his release from captivity in 1642, and his ongoing commitment to the English Royalist faction in exile. He also became a Knight of the Garter in 1642. Throughout the period Rupert was inconvenienced by his lack of secure income, and his ongoing feuds with other leading members of the Royalist circle.|$|E
5|$|As the {{demographics}} of the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were more or less undisguised homosexuals, but these, in accordance with the attitudes of the times, tended to be villains: evil, demented, or effeminate stereotypes. The most popular role for the homosexual was as a 'decadent slaveholding lordling' whose corrupt tyranny was doomed to be overthrown <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> male heterosexual hero. During this period, lesbians were almost entirely unrepresented as either heroes or villains.|$|E

5|$|Following the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, the Ottoman Turkish Empire {{experienced}} {{democracy and}} several political parties were created.

Albanians opposed the nationalist character of the movement and led local uprisings in 1910 and 1912. During the latter they managed to seize most of Kosovo and took Skopje on 11 August. On 18 August, the insurgents signed the Üsküb agreement which provided {{for the creation of}} an autonomous Albanian province and they were amnestied the day later.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that, during the Solar System's formation, Mars was created {{as the result}} of a {{stochastic}} process of run-away accretion of material from the protoplanetary disk that orbited the Sun. Mars has many distinctive chemical features caused by its position in the Solar System. Elements with comparatively low boiling points, such as chlorine, phosphorus, and sulphur, are much more common on Mars than Earth; these elements were probably pushed outward <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Sun's energetic solar wind.|$|E

5|$|Mercury (0.4AU {{from the}} Sun) {{is the closest}} planet to the Sun and the {{smallest}} planet in the Solar System (0.055 Earth masses). Mercury has no natural satellites; besides impact craters, its only known geological features are lobed ridges or rupes that were probably produced by a period of contraction early in its history. Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind. Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle {{have not yet been}} adequately explained. Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact; or, that it was prevented from fully accreting <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Sun's energy.|$|E

Chappell spent the northern summer of 1963 as a professional in England's Lancashire League with Ramsbottom and played a single first-class match for Lancashire against Cambridge University.|$|E

5|$|The {{social life}} of a crocodilian begins while it {{is still in the}} egg, because the young start {{communicating}} with each other before they are hatched.

Once it has broken out of the egg, a juvenile produces yelps and grunts, either spontaneously or as a result of external stimuli and even unrelated adults respond quickly to juvenile distress calls.|$|E
