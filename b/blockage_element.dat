30|$|Heartwood {{formation}} is a genetically and metabolically controlled {{programmed cell death}} process, {{which leads to the}} formation of heartwood extractives (Magel et al., 2001). In the transition zone, an increase in metabolic activity of parenchyma cells occurs followed by a series of cumulative events (rapid synthesis of secondary metabolites called extractives, <b>blockages</b> of conducting <b>elements</b> by formation of tyloses and structural changes in pits) preceding the death of the parenchyma cells (Spicer, 2005). The extractives formed by the living parenchyma cells in the transition zone are released and deposited in the neighbouring cells, imparting durability and colour in some species. It is postulated that heartwood formation regulates the amount and function of sapwood, controlling water transport and storage of reserve materials (Spicer, 2005). Despite the physiological importance of heartwood, the biological aspects of its formation are still not well understood.|$|R
40|$|Water {{relations}} in cotton plants infected with Phymatotrichum omnivorum were studied {{to determine the}} mechanism of wilt development. Relationships between leaf water and osmotic potentials, relative water contents, and diffusive resistances of leaves from diseased and waterstressed healthy plants were similar, indicating that wilting was not due to changes in leaf osmotic regulation. Rates of recovery from wilting, measured as increases in relative water content with time in both diseased and waterstressed healthy plants were identical. There {{was no significant difference}} in root dry weight of healthy and diseased plants, indicating that wilting is not a consequence of reduced root area. Resistance to water flow in roots and lower stems increased significantly over those of healthy plants as upper leaves of diseased plants began to wilt. However, resistance to water flow in petioles of diseased plants was unchanged. These results show that wilting in cotton plants is probably the consequence of increased resistance to water flow in roots. Results of a preliminary study indicate that a high-molecular-weight substance produced by the fungus in culture may cause <b>blockage</b> of xylem <b>elements</b> in roots and lower stems and contribute to the increased resistance to water flow...|$|R
40|$|The Advanced Neutron Source (ANS) severe {{accident}} document {{was developed to}} provide a concise and coherent mechanism for presenting the ANS SAP goals, a strategy satisfying these goals, a succinct summary of the work done to date, and {{what needs to be}} done in the future to ensure timely licensability. Guidance was received from various bodies [viz., panel members of the ANS {{severe accident}} workshop and safety review committee, Department of Energy (DOE) orders, Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requirements for ALWRs and advanced reactors, ACRS comments, world-wide trends] were utilized to set up the ANS-relevant SAS goals and strategy. An in-containment worker protection goal was also set up to account for the routine experimenters and other workers within containment. The strategy for achieving the goals is centered upon closing the severe accident issues that have the potential for becoming certification issues when assessed against realistic bounding events. Realistic bounding events are defined as events with an occurrency frequency greater than 10 {sup {minus} 6 }/y. Currently, based upon the level- 1 probabilistic risk assessment studies, the realistic bounding events for application for issue closure are flow <b>blockage</b> of fuel <b>element</b> coolant channels, and rapid depressurization-related accidents...|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} a plant-specific {{study for}} a BWR/ 4 with a Mark I containment that evaluated {{the potential for}} LOCA generated debris and the probability of losing long term recirculation capability due ECCS pump suction strainer <b>blockage.</b> The major <b>elements</b> of this study were: (1) acquisition of detailed piping layouts and installed insulation details for a reference BWR; (2) analysis of plant specific piping weld failure probabilities to estimate the LOCA frequency; (3) development of an insulation and other debris generation and drywell transport models for the reference BWR; (4) modeling of debris transport in the suppression pool; (5) development of strainer blockage head loss models for estimating loss of NPSH margin; (6) estimation of core damage frequency attributable to loss of ECCS recirculation capability following a LOCA. Elements 2 through 5 were combined into a computer code, BLOCKAGE 2. 3. A point estimate of overall DEGB pipe break frequency (per Rx-year) of 1. 59 E- 04 was calculated for the reference plant, with a corresponding overall ECCS loss of NPSH frequency (per Rx-year) of 1. 58 E- 04. The calculated point estimate of core damage frequency (per Rx-year) due to blockage related accident sequences for the reference BWR ranged from 4. 2 E- 06 to 2. 5 E- 05. The {{results of this study}} show that unacceptable strainer blockage and loss of NPSH margin can occur within the first few minutes after ECCS pumps achieve maximum flows when the ECCS strainers are exposed to LOCA generated fibrous debris in the presence of particulates (sludge, paint chips, concrete dust). Generic or unconditional extrapolation of these reference plant calculated results should not be undertaken...|$|R
