As 2000 ended and 2001 began, the {{producers}} of Millionaire decided that it had <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> (71 games over a five-month period) since their top prize had been won, and instituted an accumulating jackpot which added $10,000 to the grand prize amount for each game it was not won. Kevin Olmstead claimed the top prize on April 10, 2001, winning a jackpot of $2,180,000. Olmstead became the first contestant to top $2,000,000 in total winnings on a game show and supplanted Legler as the all-time leader.|$|E

The book is divided into an Introduction followed by four different Parts and an Appendix consisting of Notes A to F that have <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to be included as footnotes in the main text. That is, the main text has footnotes, but some of these refer {{to one of the}} notes A to F in the appendix. Parts I to IV are subdivided in various sections or chapters that sometimes also have roman numerals, so that Part I has sections I and II and Part VI has chapters I to VII.|$|E

500|$|Although the {{syndicated}} Millionaire had produced two millionaires {{in its first}} season, Nancy Christy's May 2003 win was still standing as the most recent when the program began its eighth season in fall of 2009. Deciding that six-plus years had <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> since someone had won the top prize, producers conducted a tournament to find a third million dollar winner. For the first nine weeks of the 2009–10 season, each episode saw contestants attempt to qualify for what {{was referred to as}} the [...] "Tournament of Ten". Contestants were seeded based on how much money they had won, with the biggest winner ranked first and the lowest ranked tenth. Ties were broken based on how much time a contestant had banked when they had walked away from the game.|$|E

500|$|... "You Don't Know What to Do" [...] is a disco revival {{song with}} {{elements}} of gospel, pop and R styles. It lasts for a duration of four minutes and 46 seconds. Several critics highlighted the track as {{following in the}} recent disco revivalism footsteps of Daft Punk, Justin Timberlake and posthumous Michael Jackson material. The song begins with Carey singing about how {{she is in a}} dilemma {{as to whether or not}} she wishes to stay in a relationship with her lover, as he is no longer capable of romancing her. In response, Wale raps about how he is trying to woo her and is asking for a second chance. Carey then decides that it has <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> that Wale has not loved her for, and feels liberated for letting him go. Kenneth Partridge of Billboard likened the string arrangement to Chic's 1979 single [...] "Good Times". Pitchfork Media writer Jordan Sargent compared [...] "You Don't Know What to Do" [...] to Carey's previous singles [...] "Fantasy" [...] (1995) and [...] "Heartbreaker" [...] (1999), but noted that it felt like a [...] "logical extension of post-Pharrell disco revivalism".

Justice Minister Chinamasa said that this {{represented}} another {{step in the process}} {{and that it would be}} followed by the swearing in of the Prime Minister and the new Cabinet, remarking that [...] "the locomotive has <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> at the railway station and it is now warming up its engine towards delivering services to the people". According to Chinamasa, parliamentary approval of the constitutional amendments was not necessary prior to the appointment of the Prime Minister; he said that the amendments would enable Tsvangirai and Mutambara to take up seats in Parliament, and that having seats in Parliament would merely provide them with constitutional legitimacy after they assumed office as ministers. In other comments, Chinamasa blamed the MDC for stalling the situation and complained that it was trying to renew discussion on matters that had been previously settled.|$|E

However, Xiao Feng wakes up soon after. Then, time goes on (and a hermit crab scuttles across the camera) and Xiao Feng and Ah Ken get married.

2500|$|Stevens {{returned}} to the United States in March 1908 to visit his family in Washington, D.C. and vacation with his sisters at a cottage they owned in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Upon his arrival, he gave {{an interview with a}} San Francisco newspaper in which he stated that the common people of Korea were benefiting from the increasing Japanese presence and protection in their country, and that, in the state that Korea was in, Korea was not fit to be a liberated country. These statements provoked the ire of two local associations of Koreans, the Daedong Bogukhoe and the Independence Club, who held a joint meeting in which they agreed that {{something had to be done}} about Stevens. On March 22, 1908, four Korean men chosen by the associations accosted Stevens at the Fairmont Hotel, where he was staying. Their leader, a man by the name of Earl Lee who was described as fluent in English, asked him if he had indeed made the statements attributed to him in the newspaper, and whether [...] "Japanese were not killing off the Koreans". He answered yes to the first question and no to the second, then proceeded to tell Lee that he had [...] "probably <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> away from his country to know the exact condition of the Government." [...] Upon this, the four men began to strike Stevens with chairs, knocking him down and causing him to strike his head against the marble flooring; Stevens backed up against the wall until help arrived. After the assault, Lee was quoted as saying, [...] "We are all very sorry that we did not do more to him." ...|$|E
