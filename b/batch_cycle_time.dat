40|$|Eurycoma longifolia or Tongkat Ali {{water extract}} is a valued {{product in the}} {{phytochemical}} industry. This work features the modelling and optimisation of a Tongkat Ali water extract production using SuperPro DesignerÂ®, a batch process simulator. The objective of this work is to design an economically viable production scheme for a locally developed Tongkat Ali extract production process. The current pilot scale production scheme of Tongkat Ali extract was used to simulate the base case process. Four alternative production schemes were further developed with several debottlenecking and optimisation strategies. The final alternative scheme was reported to achieve a product yield of 3. 00 %, with an annual production of 1137. 72 kg of Tongkat Ali extract. The minimum <b>batch</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> was reduced from 24. 4 hours in the base case to 8. 04 hours. Economic analysis determined that the proposed alternative production scheme has an annual revenue of $ 6. 32 M, with a 38. 6 % gross margin and a 32. 9 % return on investment...|$|E
40|$|Metallurgists {{operating}} Knelson Concentrators (KC) often rely on manufacturers {{recommendations for}} selecting operating parameters, such as fluidising {{water flow rate}} and cycle time. Recent {{studies have shown that}} these parameters are not only dependent on the machine parameters but also on the feed characteristics, such as size distribution of the gold and gangue particles and the composition of its constituent minerals. It is known that a particle entering a KC initially traverses a circular path within the bowl. For a particle to maintain a given orbit, the required centripetal force must be supplied by external means. It has been argued that this centripetal force which is dependent on the mass of the particle, its radial position and the rotational speed of the bowl, is provided by the fluid drag force created by inwardly moving fluidising water and the Bagnold's force created by the particle/particle collisions. Depending on the fluidising water flow rate, one of two situations can occur where the porosity of the bed increases or decreases which influences the amount of material retained within the bowl. The amount of material of a given size and density retained in the bowl is thus dependent on the extent of the centripetal force provided. Based on the above concept, a criterion {{that can be used to}} predict the amount of material recovered in the bowl has been derived and validated by experimental data. It may also be construed that this criterion demarcates the transition of the bed from a packed-bed state to a fluidised state. By identifying the transition values for the different constituent mineral particles in the feed, it is possible to estimate the optimal fluidising water flow rate that would maximise gold recovery while minimising gangue recovery. In addition, the kinetics of gangue displacement by incoming heavy mineral particles were also studied using synthetic mineral mixtures. The experimental data suggests that this process follows first order kinetics and that the build-up of heavy mineral reaches a maximum. A model has been proposed to predict the optimal <b>batch</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> for a KC in terms of the feed characteristics and machine operating parameters...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To sustain in {{business}} by meeting the customer expectations with limited resources under tight schedule {{is a great}} challenge for high volume manufacturing industry. In this respect Value Stream Mapping (VSM) {{plays an important role}} as a strategic tool in streamlining the processing operations and enhances capacity utilization. This study has been conducted on application of VSM in a make-to-order metal stamping company engaged in production of different stamped parts of which the LCD TV frame is a significant one. Based on the product flow analysis, a current state VSM has been constructed using pertinent data collected from the production floor. Analysis of recorded videos and time studies were performed in order to figure out the scope of improvements in framing the future state map (FSM) in the context of <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> reduction and line balancing efficiency. As observed from the FSM, the efficiency of production line is possible to be significantly increased from about 48 % to more than 93 % vis-à-vis a reduced <b>batch</b> completion <b>cycle</b> <b>time.</b> Thus it is obvious that with minor adjustments in the system in line with the findings of the study, the industry can make a substantial improvement in their operational efficiency...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the first-order intrinsic kinetic constant (k(1)) and the liquid-phase mass transfer coefficient (k(c)) in a bench-scale anaerobic sequencing batch biofilm reactor (ASBBR) fed with glucose. A dynamic heterogeneous mathematical model, considering two phases (liquid and solid), was developed through mass balances in the liquid and solid phases. The model was adjusted to experimental data obtained from the ASBBR applied for the treatment of glucose-based synthetic wastewater with approximately 500 mg L- 1 of glucose, operating in 8 h <b>batch</b> <b>cycles,</b> at 30 degrees C and 300 rpm. The values of the parameters obtained were 0. 8911 min(- 1) for k(1) and 0. 7644 cm min(- 1) for kc.

In an effort to identify and act accordingly when these variations occur, the development of a software application to analyse equipment <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> via OPC is investigated in this project. Manufacturing organisations continuously seek improvements {{in equipment}} performance and output. A common improvement made is the reduction of equipment <b>cycle</b> <b>time,</b> this provides an increase in output for a relatively small capital outlay. These improvements remain relatively unchecked and variations in <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> due to numerous factors continue to influence equipment performance. An equipment <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> analyser can be used to monitor and report variations in <b>cycle</b> <b>time.</b> The resulting information can be used to predict equipment failures and allow maintenance departments to plan corrective actions. This analyser tool can also be used by engineering departments for analysing equipment <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> during <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> improvement projects and new equipment installation. Currently the development of the <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> analyser system is at a stage where the <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> of equipment can be monitored using OPC as a means of communication.
