50|$|Afroaves is a clade of birds, {{consisting}} of the kingfishers <b>and</b> <b>kin</b> (Coraciiformes), woodpeckers <b>and</b> <b>kin</b> (Piciformes), hornbills <b>and</b> <b>kin</b> (Bucerotiformes), trogons (Trogoniformes), cuckoo roller (Leptosomatiformes), mousebirds (Coliiformes), owls (Strigiformes), raptors (Accipitriformes) and New World vultures (Cathartiformes). The most basal clades are predatory, suggesting the last common ancestor of the group was also.|$|R
50|$|Neoaves is a clade that {{consists}} of all modern birds (Neornithes or Aves) {{with the exception of}} Paleognathae (ratites <b>and</b> <b>kin)</b> <b>and</b> Galloanserae (ducks, chickens <b>and</b> <b>kin).</b> The early diversification of the various neoavian groups occurred very rapidly around the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, and attempts to resolve their relationships with each other have resulted initially in much controversy.|$|R

40|$|<b>Kin</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Kin</b> 2 are S. cerevisiae {{counterparts}} of Par- 1, the C. elegans kinase {{essential for}} the establishment of polarity in the one cell embryo. Here, we present evidence for a novel link between Kin 1, <b>Kin</b> 2 <b>and</b> the secretory machinery of the budding yeast. We isolated <b>KIN</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>KIN</b> 2 as suppressors of a mutant form of Rho 3, a Rho-GTPase acting in polarized trafficking. Genetic analysis suggests that <b>KIN</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>KIN</b> 2 act downstream of the Rab-GTPase Sec 4, its exchange factor Sec 2, and several components of the vesicle tethering complex, the Exocyst. We show that <b>Kin</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Kin</b> 2 physically interact with the t-SNARE Sec 9 and the Lgl homologue Sro 7, proteins acting at the final stage of exocytosis. Structural analysis of Kin 2 reveals that its catalytic activity is essential for its function in the secretory pathway, and implicates the conserved 42 amino acid tail at the carboxyterminal of the kinase in auto-inhibition. Finally, we find that <b>Kin</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Kin</b> 2 induce phosphorylation of t-SNARE Sec 9 in vivo and stimulate its release from the plasma membrane. In summary, we report the finding that yeast Par- 1 counterparts are associated with and regulate the function of the exocytic apparatus via phosphorylation of Sec 9. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{preference}} {{of the female}} plants of fluted pumpkin for leaves and fruits production necessitated {{the investigation into the}} effect of cytokinins in the proliferation of fluted pumpkin nodal explants. In two consecutive trials, nodal cuttings of fluted pumpkin were first cultured in-vitro on MS – Murashige and Skoog (1962) basal medium supplemented with seven concentrations of BA [N 6 - benzyladenine] (0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mg l- 1) <b>and</b> <b>Kin</b> [Kinetin] (0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mgl- 1) separately. The result of the first trial indicated that BA <b>and</b> <b>Kin</b> concentration higher than 1 and 2 mg l- 1 respectively resulted in high callus formation. Consequently, in the second trial, BA at (0, 0. 5, 1 and 2 mg l- 1) <b>and</b> <b>Kin</b> at (0, 0. 5 and 1 mg l- 1) were combined in a factorial design. At 21 days after culture (DAC), it was observed that BA <b>and</b> <b>Kin</b> at 0. 5 and 1. 0 mg l- 1 respectively gave the highest number of shoots with the least callus formation...|$|R

40|$|Mixed {{synthetic}} oligonucleotides encoding sequences conserved among tyrosine-specific protein kinases {{were used}} to probe the genome of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Two genes with homology to protein kinases were isolated and characterized by DNA sequence analysis. These genes, designated <b>KIN</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>KIN</b> 2, {{are closely related to}} each other. Among previously characterized protein kinases, the products of <b>KIN</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>KIN</b> 2 are most closely related to the bovine cAMP-dependent protein kinase (30 % amino acid identities) and the protein encoded by the v-src oncogene (27 % and 25 % identities with <b>KIN</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>KIN</b> 2, respectively) within their putative kinase domains. <b>KIN</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>KIN</b> 2 are transcribed into 3. 5 -kilobase mRNAs that contain uninterrupted open reading frames encoding polypeptides of 117 kDa and 126 kDa, respectively. The predicted proteins are unusual in two respects: (i) their catalytic domains are carried near the N termini of relatively large proteins, in contrast to the majority of characterized protein kinases, and (ii) these catalytic domains are structural mosaics, with some features characteristic of tyrosine-specific protein kinases and other elements that are distinctive of serine/threonine-specific enzymes...|$|R
