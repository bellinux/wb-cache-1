50|$|<b>Butt</b> <b>welding</b> {{is usually}} {{performed}} {{using one of}} several methods. The first, and most common, is <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> or <b>butt</b> fusion, which {{is a type of}} hot plate welding. This technique involves heating two planed surfaces of thermoplastic material (typically polyethylene) against a heated surface. After a specified amount of time, the heating plate is removed and the two pieces are pressed together and allowed to cool under pressure, forming the desired bond. <b>Butt</b> <b>welding</b> outside of manufacturing is usually performed to join pipes.|$|R

50|$|The <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> of two plates {{results in}} bending of the {{weldment}} because more material has been melted {{at the head}} than {{at the root of}} the weld. This effect is of course not as substantial as in arc welding.|$|E

40|$|Flash <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> {{is a well}} {{established}} economical process for solid state <b>butt</b> <b>welding.</b> It consists indirect electrical heating of {{the ends of the}} work pieces to be welded and forging them together. While heating, a thermal distribution characterized by a steep temperature gradient is established along the axial length of the pieces. Flash <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> is widely used for steel band welding m wheel industry. Major advantages are economical in operation, suitable for mass production and high in joint strength. Loadstar (pvt) Ltd has six flash butt machines in different production lines for rim and band manufacturing. The major problem is considerably high amount of scrap percentage due to welding cracks. This problem severely affects the lines which have severe forming or stretching operations in latter stages. For this investigation the line 05 was selected which has high scrap percentage. The main aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the flash <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> cracks in rim manufacturing and to find out the main reasons for the defects. The analysis of flash <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> cracks in nm manufacturing is done m five stages. In the first stage, attention is paid to literature survey, in which the present stage of the researches carried out in the industry regarding the flash <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> is discussed. Only few literature sources are available although there are many wheel manufacturing companies- [...] in the world. Certainly there might be a lot of researches carried out under this topic in the history,' but due to high competitiveness among the companies the research outcomes might be kept as company secrets. In this project, the analysis of flash <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> cracks in wheel manufacturing will be discussed in detail. The second stage is process description.. and principles of flash <b>butt</b> <b>welding.</b> Third stage is problem identification and the fourth stage is methodology to solve the problem. In methodology it has stated that the identified process' variables that affect the welding quality and how further testing are carried out. Experimental work and results are reviewed under the fifth stage. In this chapter, the testing done for research is discussed in detail and final conclusion is on how the increasing advance velocity of the movable jaw of flash butt machine while keeping the same voltage will give better results in weld joints for SS 400 material...|$|R

In total, 165 published test results for <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> subject to R = 0. 1 and R = 0. 5 axial loading are presented. K n, min values for the ENS approach are suggested in order to avoid computational problems due to low stress concentrations at the weld toe. Minimum notch stress concentration values are suggested based on the material yield strength (f y). All the data is presented with respect to previously proposed and verified material f y correction method. For HFMI-treated <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> in the ENS system, the use of the K n, min values with the f y correction representing one fatigue class (approximately 12. 5 %) increase in strength for every 200 -MPa increase in f y has been proposed and verified. © 2014 International Institute of Welding...|$|R
50|$|The square-groove is a {{butt welding}} joint {{with the two}} pieces being flat and {{parallel}} to each other. This joint is simple to prepare, economical to use, and provides satisfactory strength, but is limited by joint thickness. The closed square <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> {{is a type of}} square-groove joint with no spacing in between the pieces. This joint type is common with gas and arc welding.|$|E
50|$|This type of weld {{is usually}} {{accomplished}} with an arc or MIG welder. It {{can also be}} accomplished by brazing. With arc welding, after the <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> is complete, the weld itself needs to be struck with a hammer forge to remove slag (a type of waste material) before any subsequent welds can be applied. This is not necessary for MIG welds however, as a protective gas removes any need for slag to appear. Another with a MIG welder is that a continuous copper coated wire is fed onto the stock, making the weld virtually inexhaustible.|$|E

At the rear edge of the front sill pad, a <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> attaches the front sill pad to the body bolster pad and to the fillet weld attaching the body bolster pad to the tank shell. Fillet welds at the interior and exterior sides of the head brace attach the head brace to the front sill pad, and an exterior fillet weld attaches the head brace to the draft sill. To the rear of the head brace, the draft sill is welded to the front sill pad, body bolster pad, and reinforcing bars.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to argue whether the {{certification}} process used in Finland for <b>butt</b> <b>welded</b> products is sufficient for ensuring quality welds. This topic was approached by reviewing the plastic joining technical codes for <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> {{in order to understand}} the correct <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> process, the weld testing procedures and the common weld im-perfections. To get an understanding of the certification process, the involved bodies were reviewed along with the functions of notified bodies, the roles of standards, and the function of certification markings. For the practical part of this project a welding procedure test (WPT) was conducted with PRP-Plastic Oy on the Wegener SM 440 TPQ thermoplastic sheet <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> machine. The procedure test required the creation of test samples for PP, PVC and PVDF sheets of various thicknesses, for which the technical codes were used as a guide. The samples were then sent to Häme UAS for tensile testing on their accredited testing machine. Af-terwards, the results are sent to Inspecta, a notified body, along with the welding proce-dure specifications for certification. A bending test, independent to the WPT, was con-ducted on some of the samples to test the ductility of the welds...|$|R

30|$|Welding is {{the main}} method of PE pipes joining for {{pipeline}} construction. As for today, the following welding methods are sufficiently developed from technological {{point of view and}} are commonly used in practice: hot tool <b>butt</b> <b>welding,</b> hot tool socket welding, and resistance welding [7, 8]. The last two methods require some special coupling details, such as socket and resistance fittings. <b>Butt</b> <b>welding</b> is the most simple and multipurpose method and can be used for pipes of all diameters (except the thin-wall pipes).|$|R
50|$|Pipes are {{commonly}} joined by welding, using threaded pipe and fittings; sealing {{the connection with}} a pipe thread compound, Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) Thread seal tape, oakum, or PTFE string, or by using a mechanical coupling. Process piping is usually joined by welding using a TIG or MIG process. The most common process pipe joint is the <b>butt</b> <b>weld.</b> The ends of pipe to be welded must have a certain weld preparation called an End Weld Prep (EWP) which is typically at an angle of 37.5 degrees to accommodate the filler weld metal. The most common pipe thread in North America is the National Pipe Thread (NPT) or the Dryseal (NPTF) version. Other pipe threads include the British standard pipe thread (BSPT), the garden hose thread (GHT), and the fire hose coupling (NST).|$|E
5000|$|Butt welds are welds {{where two}} pieces of metal are to be joined {{are in the same}} plane. These types of welds require only some {{preparation}} and are used with thin sheet metals that can be welded with a single pass. Common issues that can weaken a <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> are the entrapment of slag, excessive porosity, or cracking. For strong welds, the goal is to use the least amount of welding material possible. Butt welds are prevalent in automated welding processes, such as submerged-arc welding, due to their relative ease of preparation. [...] When metals are welded without human guidance, there is no operator to make adjustments for non-ideal joint preparation. Because of this necessity, butt welds can be utilized for their simplistic design to be fed through automated welding machines efficiently.|$|E
50|$|A {{year later}} in March 1981, the investigative report {{concluded}} that the rig collapsed owing to a fatigue crack {{in one of its}} six bracings (bracing D-6), which connected the collapsed D-leg {{to the rest of the}} rig. This was traced to a small 6 mm fillet weld which joined a non-load-bearing flange plate to this D-6 bracing. This flange plate held a sonar device used during drilling operations. The poor profile of the fillet weld contributed to a reduction in its fatigue strength. Further, the investigation found considerable amounts of lamellar tearing in the flange plate and cold cracks in the <b>butt</b> <b>weld.</b> Cold cracks in the welds, increased stress concentrations due to the weakened flange plate, the poor weld profile, and cyclical stresses (which would be common in the North Sea), seemed to collectively play a role in the rig's collapse.|$|E

40|$|The fatigue {{behaviour}} of 25 mm aluminium-alloy {{full and}} partial penetration <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> were investigated. Strain controlled fatigue {{tests of the}} 5083 aluminium-alloy base and 5183 weld metal were carried out to determine the monotonic and cyclic stress-strain properties. Crack propagation measurements were performed using center crack tension specimens. The weldments were tested under axial loading for R= 0 and - 1. For the full-penetration <b>butt</b> <b>welds,</b> the crack initiated at the weld toe, while for the partial penetration <b>butt</b> <b>welds,</b> the crack started at the weld root. The high stress concentration at the weld root decreases the fatigue strength of the welds with UP {{as compared to the}} full penetration <b>butt</b> <b>welds.</b> In presence of a tensile mean stress, the fatigue life is significantly shorter than under fully reversed loading. An analytical model was used to predict the lifetime of the weldments. The total lifetime is composed of crack initiation and crack propagation. Because of the high stress concentration at the weld root the period of crack initiation is negligible for the weldments with UP. The lifetime based on crack propagation can be simply described using the geometry factor of the center crack tension specimen. Considering of the extra material provided by the weld reinforcement is suggested. The model predictions agreed with the experimental results for the full penetration <b>butt</b> <b>welds.</b> While for R= 0, the most lifetime was spent in crack initiation (and small crack growth), for R=- 1 the relative amount of crack propagation is more dominant due to crack closure under compressive loading...|$|R
40|$|<b>Butt</b> <b>weld</b> {{connection}} {{is one of}} the most commonly used connection types in steel structures, and its post-fire mechanical property is crucial for the estimation of the residual mechanical capacity of steel structures after building fires. To study the mechanical properties of <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> connections after being exposed to high temperatures, Q 235 and Q 345 <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> specimens were designed, heated to various high temperatures between 400 °C and 800 °C, and then naturally cooled to room temperature. Tensile tests were conducted on these <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> specimens to obtain the force–displacement curves and relevant mechanical properties (yield and ultimate strengths) at various temperatures. The following conclusions were obtained from the test results: (1) The post-fire mechanical properties of the <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> specimens were affected by material grade and heating temperature; (2) when the temperature exceeded 600 °C, the yield and ultimate strengths of the Q 235 and Q 345 <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> specimens began to decrease; the strength reduction of the latter was greater than that of the former; (3) when the temperature was 800 °C, the yield strength and ultimate strength of Q 235 decreased to 87 % and 91 % of the ambient-temperature yield and ultimate strengths, respectively; and (4) the yield and ultimate strengths of Q 345 decreased to 83 % and 87 % of those at room temperature.

A single <b>welded</b> <b>butt</b> joint is the name for a joint that has only been welded from one side. A double <b>welded</b> <b>butt</b> joint is created when the weld has been welded from both sides. With double welding, the depths of each weld can vary slightly.

40|$|Modern steel {{manufacturing}} techniques make {{it possible}} to produce steel with nominal strengths up to 1100 MPa (very high strength steels, VHSS). For the design of cyclic loaded slender VHSS structures, the fatigue strength of both base material and welded components should be known. In a VHSS fatigue loaded structure absolute and relative stress variation will be higher compared to structures made of conventional steel. According to EN 1993 - 1 - 9 (2005), applicable to steels with yield strengths up to 690 MPa, fatigue strength of welded connections mainly depends on the applied detail, plate thickness and machining condition, not on yield strength. Literature results on base materials however show higher fatigue strength by increased yield strength. If the use of VHSS would be beneficial increasing the fatigue strength of a welded joint as well, than most likely this increase would be shown in a high quality <b>butt</b> <b>weld,</b> having lower stress concentration compared to other welded details, like a fillet weld. Laboratory tests have been performed in order to study the fatigue strength of base materials and as welded <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> joints made of S 690 and S 1100.
