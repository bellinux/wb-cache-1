40|$|Abstract: Magnetic <b>drive</b> <b>pump</b> {{has gotten}} great {{achievement}} {{and has been}} widely used in some special fields. Currently, the researches on magnetic <b>drive</b> <b>pump</b> have focused on hydraulic design, bearing, axial force in China, and a new magnetic <b>drive</b> <b>pump</b> with low flow and high head have been developed overseas. However, low efficiency and large size are the common disadvantages for the magnetic <b>drive</b> <b>pump.</b> In order to study the performance of high-speed magnetic <b>drive</b> <b>pump,</b> FLUENT is used to simulate the inner flow field of magnetic <b>drive</b> <b>pumps</b> with different rotate speeds, and get velocity and pressure distributions of inner flow field. According to analysis the changes of velocity and pressure to ensure the stable operation of pump and avoid cavitation. Based on the analysis of velocity and pressure, this paper presents the pump efficiency of magnetic <b>drive</b> <b>pumps</b> with different rotated speeds by calculating the power loss in impeller and volute, hydraulic loss, volumetric loss, mechanical loss and discussing the different reasons of power loss between the magnetic <b>drive</b> <b>pumps</b> with different rotated speeds. In addition, the magnetic <b>drive</b> <b>pumps</b> are tested in a closed testing system. Pressure sensors are set in inlet and outlet of magnetic <b>drive</b> <b>pumps</b> to get the pressure and the head, while the pump efficiency can be got by calculating the power loss between the input power and the outlet power. The results of simulation and test are similar, which shows tha...|$|R

40|$|Efficient belts {{can provide}} the same {{magnitude}} of energy savings as energy-efficient motors. Therefore, <b>belt</b> <b>drives</b> deserve greater attention, so that their losses should be minimized.

40|$|Conventional {{reliability}} assessment and reliability-based optimal design of <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> {{are based on}} the stress–strength interference model. However, the stress–strength interference model is essentially a static model, and the sensitivity analysis of <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> reliability with respect to design parameters needs further investigations. In this article, time-dependent factors that contribute the dynamic characteristics of reliability are pointed out. Moreover, dynamic reliability models and failure rate models of <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> systems under the failure mode of slipping are developed. Furthermore, dynamic sensitivity models of <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> reliability based on the proposed dynamic reliability models are proposed. In addition, numerical examples are given to illustrate the proposed models and analyze the influences of design parameters on dynamic characteristics of reliability, failure rate, and sensitivity functions.
