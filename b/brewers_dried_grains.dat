40|$|ABSTRACT Metabolizable energy (ME) {{values of}} some {{ingredients}} were determined using laying hens. Diets {{used in these}} studies were composed primarily of the test ingredient plus minerals and vitamins. Mature hens, housed in separate cages, were permitted to adjust to each test diet for about 2 weeks, followed by a 3 or 4 day collection during which total feed intake and excreta out-put were recorded for individual birds. ME values for rice bran, wheat middlings, <b>brewers</b> <b>dried</b> <b>grains,</b> and alfalfa meal {{were found to be}} 2. 54, 1. 90, 1. 84, and 1. 78 kcal/g, respectively.

Sixteen West African Dwarf goats weighing 5. 0 - 5. 6 kg {{were used in}} a 112 days feeding experiment {{to determine the effect}} of citrus pulp in the dry season feed of West African Dwarf goats placed on Enterolobium cyclocarpum as basal feed. The dried citrus pulp contained 6. 3 % crude protein, 17. 63 % crude fibre, 5. 13 % ash and 69. 32 % nitrogen free extractives on DM basis. Citrus seeds, collected separately, contained 11. 69 % CP, 8 % CF, 5 % ash and 69. 44 % NFE. A control diet with contained 88. 5 % <b>Brewers?</b> <b>Dried</b> <b>Grains</b> (BDG) and three experimental diets in which BDG was replaced by citrus pulp at 25, 50 and 75 % levels in the experimental diets, respectively constituted the four treatments.

40|$|The growth {{promoting}} efficacy of procaine penicillin when supplemented {{at the rate}} of 100 mg kg- 1 into 50 g kg- 1 and 250 g kg- 1 <b>brewers</b> <b>dried</b> <b>grains</b> (BDG) based diets were compared with a control diet without a fibrous ingredient. Growth performance, nutrient intakes and retention, and haematological indices of the broiler chicks were determined during the 35 -day study. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate antibiotic supplemen-tation as a nutritional strategy to expand the utili-zation of cheap fibrous feedstuff in broiler diets. The results showed that procaine penicillin stimulated higher (p< 0. 05) feed intakes, heavier body weights and daily gains in both 50 g kg- 1 and 250 g kg- 1, and resulted into a better (p< 0. 05) feed conversion only on 50 g kg- 1 BDG. The calorie intakes by the birds were similar, but protein and dietary crude fibre intakes of broilers fed 250 g kg- 1 BDG was higher (p< 0. 05) than others. However, the apparent retention of dry matter, crude protein, and ether extract were similar on the treatments though the values appeared to decrease with inclusion of BDG. All the hematological and erythrocytic indices, serum proteins and urea concentration were unaffected except cholesterol concentration that was signifi-cantly (p< 0. 05) reduced in broilers fed 250 g kg- 1 BDG. It was concluded that penicillin supplementa-tion effectively promoted broilers weight gain and feed conversion, and it appears a feasble strategy to achieve high inclusion rates of low-cost fibrous ingredients such as <b>brewers</b> <b>dried</b> <b>grains</b> in broiler diets.

40|$|Nutrient {{utilization}} and digestibility {{of growing}} pigs fed diets of different proportions of Palm Kernel Meal (PKM) and <b>Brewers</b> <b>Dried</b> <b>Grain</b> (BDG) in the humid tropics were determined with twelve intact male hybrid (Landrace x Duroc) pigs aged 15 weeks. Their live weights ranged 16. 78 - 19. 50 kg (average 18. 36 kg). The experimental design was a Completely Randomized Design (CRD). The diets were control, 30 % PKM+ 40 % BDG, 35 % PKM+ 35 % BDG and 40 % PKM+ 30 % BDG for diets I, II, III and IV, respectively. Each diet had three replicates and a male pig per replicate. Locally constructed metabolism cages (107 x 60 x 50 cm) {{were used for}} the experiment. Measurements were nutrient intake, faecal nutrient output, digestibility coefficient of nutrients, energy utilization, Nitrogen (N) balance and protein utilization. Results showed that growing pigs fed diets of different proportions of PKM and BDG did not significantly (P< 0. 05) differ in digestibility coefficient of CP, protein utilization and N balance while 40 % PKM+ 30 % BDG diet significantly (P< 0. 05) increased N intake of growing pigs. The energy utilization indices of pigs fed diets of 35 % PKM+ 35 % BDG and 40 % PKM+ 30 % BDG were consistently superior to that of pigs fed control diet except ME as percentage of Gross Energy (GE). In conclusion, growing pigs could be fed diets different proportions of PKM and BDG without adverse effect on nutrient utilization and digestibility; however N intake would increase with 40 % PKM+ 30 % BDG diet...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of weaner pigs to diets of different proportions {{and high levels}} of palm kernel meal (PKM) and <b>brewers</b> <b>dried</b> <b>grain</b> (BDG) in the humid tropics was determined with 24 hybrid (Landrace x Duroc) pigs whose initial live weights ranged from 8. 08 to 8. 21 kg (average 8. 18 kg). The different proportions of PKM + BDG in the diets were 30 + 40 % (T 2), 35 + 35 % (T 3), and 40 + 30 % (T 4), respectively. PKM + BDG was 0 % in T 1 (control) and replaced maize in diets T 2, T 3 and T 4. Growth performance and cost-benefit were evaluated at the weaner stage, while carcass and organ characteristics were added at the end of grower stage. Parameters measured were live weight, weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion ratio (FCR), protein efficiency ratio (PER), feed cost, feed cost of weight gain, gross margin, carcass and organ characteristics. Diets of different proportions of PKM and BDG significantly (P< 0. 05) increased FCR and protein intake, significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced cost of production and increased gross margin at the wea ner stage. At the grower stage, PKM+BDG diets significantly (P< 0. 05) lowered final live weight, weight gain, PER and significantly (P< 0. 05) increased FCR, feed and protein intake. The diets also significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced total feed cost compared to the control diet and affected some carcass and organ characteristics without regular pattern. It was concluded that weaner and grower pigs could be fed diets containing 70 % PKM + BDG (at various proportional combinations), replacing maize completely in the diets...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: One {{hundred and}} fifty male {{broilers}} were used in a 3 x 3 factorial design to evaluate the effect of 3 periods (4, 8 and 12 weeks) and 3 fibre sources namely; <b>brewer’s</b> <b>dried</b> <b>grain</b> (BDG), palm kernel meal (PKM) and corn bran (CB) in place of maize on the performance, carcase measures and meat quality in the birds. A sensory evaluation to determine the overall acceptability of the meat was also carried out. Four diets were formulated consisting of a basal diet containing none of the test fibre ingredients. In the remaining 3 diets, either of BDG, CB or PKM was used to replace 40 % of the maize. A separate balance study was also carried out to determine the digestibility of nutrients in the birds. BDG, CB and PKM significantly (p< 0. 01) reduced the weight and feed conversion in the birds but period of feeding resulted in increased body weights of the birds. BDG, CB and PKM significantly (p< 0. 01) reduced the eviscerated weights and the weights of carcase parts but period significantly (p< 0. 01) increased them. Dietary treatment, period and their interaction significantly (p< 0. 01) reduced the abdominal fat in the birds and caused a significant (p< 0. 05) increase in the lengths of the duodenum, ileum, caecum and colon {{as well as the}} weight of the intestines. Digestibility of nutrients was significantly (p< 0. 1) reduced in birds on the fibre diets. The shear force values in carcase parts were significantly increased in the BDG, CB and PKM diets while the cooking loss was significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced in these diets.

For the digestibility assay a total of 28 males rabbits were used, White New Zealand x California, with 50 days of age with an initial weight of 1. 400 Â 0. 100 kg, distributed on a completely randomized block design, with two treatments and fourteen replications, using the total of feces method. The treatments were: basal diet (BD) and ration test (RT) comprised 60 % of basal diet and 40 % <b>dried</b> <b>brewers</b> <b>grain.</b> The <b>dried</b> <b>brewers</b> <b>grain</b> showed 90. 43 % of dry matter, 37. 94 % of crude protein, 51. 72 % of neutral detergent fiber, 22. 08 % of acid detergent fiber, 8. 06 % of ether extract, 5. 30 % of mineral matters and 3371. 24 kcal of digestible energy/kg. To test the performance, a total of eighty rabbits (40 males and 40 females), White New Zealand x California, in the period from 40 to 90 days of age, allocated in a completely randomized block design in a 5 x 2 factorial arrangement, considering five levels of inclusion of the DBG (0, 7, 14, 21 e 28 %), and sex (male and female), with four replicates of two animals. No effects were observed on the performance, however, it was observed that the carcass weight decreased linearly, while the pÃncreas weight increased, due to the higher level of inclusion of the DBG. The weight of the liver of animals fed with DBG over 14 % was lower than in animals that received feed without this ingredient. There was no effect of treatments on quality characteristics of meat rabbits. No effects were observed on relation meat/bone and qualitative meat characteristics. Considering the lower cost value of feed and better economic efficiency and cost indexes, the DBG may be included up to 28 % in growing rabbits diets. Foram realizados dois ensaios, sendo o primeiro para determinar a composiÃÃo quÃmica e a energia digestÃvel do resÃduo desidratado de cervejaria (RDC) e o segundo para avaliar o efeito da inclusÃo deste ingrediente na dieta de coelhos em crescimento sobre o desempenho, caracterÃsticas da carcaÃa, qualidade da carne e viabilidade econÃmica. Para o ensaio de digestibilidade foram utilizados 28 coelhos machos com 50 dias de idade e peso inicial de 1, 400 Â 0, 100 kg, distribuÃdos no delineamento em blocos ao acaso, com dois tratamentos e quatorze repetiÃÃes, utilizando mÃtodo de coleta total de fezes. Os tratamentos foram: raÃÃo referÃncia (RR) e raÃÃo teste (RT) composta por 60 % da raÃÃo referÃncia e 40 % de resÃduo desidratado de cervejaria. O resÃduo desidratado de cervejaria apresentou 90, 43 % de matÃria seca, 37, 94 % de proteÃna bruta, 51, 72 % de fibra em detergente neutro, 22, 08 % de fibra em detergente Ãcido, 8, 06 % de extrato etÃreo, 5, 30 % de matÃria mineral e 3371, 24 kcal de energia digestÃvel/kg. Para o ensaio de desempenho foram utilizados 80 coellhos (40 machos e 40 fÃmeas) oriundos do cruzamento das raÃas Nova ZelÃndia Branco x CalifÃrnia, no perÃodo de 40 a 90 dias de idade, distribuÃdos no delineamento em blocos ao acaso em esquema fatorial 5 x 2, considerando cinco nÃveis de inclusÃo do RDC (0, 7, 14, 21 e 28 %) e o sexo (macho e fÃmea), com quatro repetiÃÃes de dois animais.
