40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{theoretical}} analysis of air bending at high temperature. A thermo-mechanical model able to predict temperature distribution and main bending parameters is developed. Thermal model assumes local heating of the sheet along <b>bend</b> <b>length</b> and is based in previous numerical model. The influence of temperature in mechanical properties of the sheet is taken into account with temperature dependent parameters of constitutive equation. Mechanical model is formulated in order to satisfy industrial requirements. Desired geometry of the piece fixes final bending angle after unloading, so this parameter is the input of the model. An iterative calculation process is used to solve presented equations obtaining curvature, sheet shape, contact force and springback. These parameters are very important in industrial processes, allowing establishment of punch displacement and maximum force to make the desired workpiece. Other results may be obtained from this model: moment distribution, maximum stress and strain. These results are related to important features of the actual process, like tools design and formability limits of the sheet. Publicad...|$|R

Quantitative knowledge of the mechanical properties of those polymers is essential for developing predictive models of cell mechanics and mechano-sensing. Linear cytoskeletal polymers, such as actin filaments and microtubules, can grow to cellular length scales at which they behave as semiflexible polymers that undergo thermally-driven shape deformations. Bending deformations are often modeled using the wormlike chain model. A quantitative metric of a polymer’s resistance to bending is the persistence length, the fundamental parameter of that model. A polymer’s <b>bending</b> persistence <b>length</b> is extracted from its shape as visualized using various imaging techniques. However, the analysis methodologies required for determining the persistence length are often not readily within reach of most biological researchers or educators. Motivated by that limitation, we developed user-friendly, multi-platform compatible software to determine the <b>bending</b> persistence <b>length</b> from images of surface-adsorbed or freely fluctuating polymers. Three different types of analysis are available (cosine correlation, end-to-end and bending-mode analyses), allowing for rigorous cross-checking of analysis results.

40|$|Bending is {{a common}} metal working process used in sheet-metal forming, such as parts of automobiles, {{aircraft}} and ships. In addition, bending is used in many sheet metal forming, such as deep drawing and stamping processes. Bending process is usually followed by some elastic recovery upon unloading, called spring-back. A static approach is described to determine new formulas for the bending force, the shift of neutral-axis {{and the value of}} spring-back, in V-die bending process.

Again, strength loss ranged 1.5 to 5.9  %, 6.6 to 12.4  %, and 12.5 to 18.9  % using 0.5, 1, and 1.5  % Mega L, respectively. On the other hand, pilling resistance was improved when the fabric was treated with cellulases in all cases.
