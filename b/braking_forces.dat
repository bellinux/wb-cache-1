5|$|As {{with all}} masses, gravity pulls the rider {{and all the}} bike {{components}} toward the earth. At each tire contact patch there are ground reaction forces with both horizontal and vertical components. The vertical components mostly counteract the force of gravity, but also vary with braking and accelerating. For details, see the section on longitudinal stability below. The horizontal components, due to friction between the wheels and the ground, including rolling resistance, are in response to propulsive forces, <b>braking</b> <b>forces,</b> and turning forces. Aerodynamic forces due to the atmosphere are mostly {{in the form of}} drag, but can also be from crosswinds. At normal bicycling speeds on level ground, aerodynamic drag is the largest force resisting forward motion. At faster speed, aerodynamic drag becomes overwhelmingly the largest force resisting forward motion.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike car {{disc brakes}} that are buried within the wheel, bike disc brakes {{are in the}} {{airstream}} and have optimum cooling. Although cast iron discs have a porous surface which give superior braking performance, such discs rust {{in the rain and}} become unsightly. Accordingly, motorcycle discs are usually stainless steel, drilled, slotted or wavy to disperse rain water. Modern motorcycle discs tend to have a floating design whereby the disc [...] "floats" [...] on bobbins and can move slightly, allowing better disc centering with a fixed caliper. A floating disc also avoids disc warping and reduces heat transfer to the wheel hub. Calipers have evolved from simple single-piston units to two-, four- and even six-piston items. Compared to cars, motorcycles have a higher center of mass:wheelbase ratio, so they experience more weight transfer when braking. Front brakes absorb most of the <b>braking</b> <b>forces,</b> while the rear brake serves mainly to balance the motorcycle during braking. Modern sport bikes typically have twin large front discs, with a much smaller single rear disc. Bikes that are particularly fast or heavy may have vented discs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The Automobile Braking System has {{a crucial}} role for safety of the {{passenger}} and riding quality of the vehicle. The <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> mainly depends on normal reaction on the wheel and the co-efficient of friction between the tire and the road surface. Whenever a vehicle is loaded, the normal reaction on the rear wheel is increased. Thus the amount of <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> required to halt the vehicle with minimum stopping distance, {{is based on the}} pillion load on the vehicle. In this work, in order to vary the <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> in two wheelers, the mechanical leverage which operates the master cylinder is varied based on the pillion load. Thus the amount of <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> developed between ground and tire is varied. This optimum <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> on the disc brake helps in attaining the minimum vehicle stopping distance. In addition to that, it also helps in preventing sliding. Thus the system results in reducing the stopping distance of the two wheelers and providing a better braking efficiency than the conventional <b>braking</b> system.
