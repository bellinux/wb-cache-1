5|$|The {{original}} {{design of the}} Singapore Power Building was executed virtually without later alteration although it would later <b>be</b> <b>surrounded</b> by hotels, the Somerset MRT Station and shopping complexes.|$|E
5|$|Just {{as it is}} {{possible}} for a circle to <b>be</b> <b>surrounded</b> by six congruent circles that touch it, it is also possible to arrange seven congruent Reuleaux triangles so that they all make contact with a central Reuleaux triangle of the same size. This is the maximum number possible for any curve of constant width.|$|E
5|$|No {{secondary}} characteristics {{have been observed}} around extrasolar planets. The sub-brown dwarf Cha 110913-773444, which {{has been described as}} a rogue planet, is believed to be orbited by a tiny protoplanetary disc and the sub-brown dwarf OTS 44 was shown to <b>be</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a substantial protoplanetary disk of at least 10 Earth masses.|$|E
50|$|Haţeg Island itself <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> {{primarily}} by a deep marine basin, {{unlike some of}} the surrounding islands and land masses which <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> by shallow seas.|$|R

5|$|A counterattack by {{elements}} of the 15th Panzer Division was launched in the afternoon of 15 July. The limited number of anti-tank guns present were exposed and quickly immobilised or forced to withdraw. This left the infantry to <b>be</b> <b>surrounded</b> and large numbers were forced to surrender. Some soldiers {{made it to the}} positions of 19th Battalion, but it too became surrounded. By nightfall, the brigade had been overrun. Only the 18th Battalion managed to escape largely intact. Of the 20th Battalion, nearly 200 men were taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick voiced {{concerns}} {{about the need for}} such pure plutonium to make a feasible bomb. He also suspected that the gun method of detonation for a plutonium bomb would lead to premature detonations due to impurities. After Chadwick met Robert Oppenheimer at the Los Alamos Laboratory in 1943, he learned of a proposed bomb design which they were calling an implosion. The sub-critical mass of plutonium was supposed to <b>be</b> <b>surrounded</b> by explosives that were arranged to detonate simultaneously. This would cause the plutonium core to be compressed and become supercritical. The core would <b>be</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a depleted uranium tamper which would reflect the neutrons back into the reaction, and contribute to the explosion by fissioning itself. This design solved Chadwick's worries about purity because it did not require the level that would be needed for the gun-type fission weapon. The biggest problem with this method was creating the explosive lenses. Chadwick took this information with him and described the method to Oliphant who then took it with him to England.|$|E
5|$|For an implant to osseointegrate, {{it needs}} to <b>be</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a healthy {{quantity}} of bone. In order for it to survive long-term, {{it needs to}} have a thick healthy soft tissue (gingiva) envelope around it. It is common for either the bone or soft tissue to be so deficient that the surgeon needs to reconstruct it either before or during implant placement.|$|E
50|$|As {{the germ}} of a fruit <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by the {{perisperm}} so the spirit, properly so called, <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by an envelope which, by analogy, may be {{designated as the}} perispirit.|$|R
50|$|An ambulacrum is an {{architectural}} {{term for the}} atrium, courtyard, or parvise {{in front of a}} basilica that <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by arcades or colonnades, often containing a fountain, and <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by trees.|$|R
50|$|The lake {{is mainly}} for {{decorative}} purposes and has four fountains. It has a dock and <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a sidewalk. The lake {{and the entire}} condominium complex <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> by Casablanca Drive.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to hosting photosynthesizing endosymbionts, sponges are noted for their {{wide range of}} collaborations with other organisms. The relatively large encrusting sponge Lissodendoryx colombiensis is most common on rocky surfaces, but has extended its range into seagrass meadows by letting itself <b>be</b> <b>surrounded</b> or overgrown by seagrass sponges, which are distasteful to the local starfish and therefore protect Lissodendoryx against them; in return the seagrass sponges get higher positions away from the sea-floor sediment.|$|E
5|$|The Raëlian Embassy for Extraterrestrials is {{the vision}} of the International Raëlian Movement to {{establish}} an embassy, at a base cost of $20 million, with a landing pad that would serve as spaceport for extraterrestrial spaceships. Its location is intended to be in neutral territory, preferably Jerusalem, and would <b>be</b> <b>surrounded</b> by acres of campground capable of supporting about 144,000 people or more than twice the estimated Raëlian membership as of 2005.|$|E
5|$|The {{core region}} may <b>be</b> <b>surrounded</b> by dense {{metallic}} hydrogen, which extends outward to about 78% of the {{radius of the}} planet. Rain-like droplets of helium and neon precipitate downward through this layer, depleting the abundance of these elements in the upper atmosphere. Rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur on Jupiter, {{as well as on}} Saturn and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.|$|E

5|$|The current {{standard}} {{theory for}} Solar System formation, the nebular hypothesis, has fallen {{into and out}} of favour since its formulation by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 18th century. The most significant criticism of the hypothesis was its apparent inability to explain the Sun's relative lack of angular momentum when compared to the planets. However, since the early 1980s studies of young stars have shown them to <b>be</b> <b>surrounded</b> by cool discs of dust and gas, exactly as the nebular hypothesis predicts, which has led to its re-acceptance.|$|E
5|$|The {{freshwater}} {{islands in}} Scotland include those within freshwater lochs and rivers – including tidal areas, so the islands {{may not always}} <b>be</b> <b>surrounded</b> by freshwater. It {{has been estimated that}} there are at least 31,460 freshwater lochs in Scotland and that 1.9% of the land surface is covered by fresh waters. The distribution has a north west to south east gradient with the highest concentrations occurring in the islands of the Outer Hebrides.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} Colonel Michaelis {{went to the}} 1st Cavalry Division command post in Hwanggan and asked {{division}} commander Major General Hobart R. Gay for permission to withdraw his regiment through that division. Gay telephoned the Eighth Army headquarters {{and asked if he}} should attack in an effort to relieve the pressure on the 27th Infantry, or if that regiment should withdraw into the 1st Cavalry Division's area, move south to Kumch'on, and then turn toward Sangju to rejoin the 25th Division. The Eighth Army decided the 27th Regiment should withdraw, as Gay feared it would quickly <b>be</b> <b>surrounded</b> if it tried to hold its position.|$|E
50|$|Na2Te, {{like many}} related {{compounds}} with the formula M2X, adopts the antifluorite structure. Thus, in solid Na2Te each Te2− ion <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by eight Na+ ions and each Na+ ion <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by four Te2− ions.|$|R

5|$|Following {{an initial}} {{decline in the}} {{population}} of Navenby {{at the turn of}} the 20th century, the post-war years saw numbers rise steeply. This increase can be directly linked to the 35-plus new houses built from the end of The Great War until the 1950s, as well as to other building projects from the 1970s onwards. Other post-war changes include the move away from a dependence on farming. Although Navenby continues to <b>be</b> <b>surrounded</b> by farms, it is now largely a dormitory village for Lincoln, Grantham and beyond. Figures from the 2001 census show that, out of a population of 1,666, almost 600 commute to work each day.|$|E
5|$|Nu Phoenicis is a yellow-white main {{sequence}} star of spectral type F9V and magnitude 4.96. Lying some 49 light years distant, it is around 1.2 times as massive as our sun, {{and likely to}} <b>be</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a disk of dust. It is the closest star in the constellation that is visible with the unaided eye. Gliese 915 is a white dwarf only 26 light years away. It is of magnitude 13.05, too faint {{to be seen with}} the naked eye. White dwarfs are extremely dense stars compacted into a volume the size of the Earth. With around 85% of the mass of the Sun, Gliese 915 has a surface gravity of 108.39 ± 0.01 (2.45 · 108) cm·s−2, or approximately 250,000 of Earth's.|$|E
5|$|The Muslim force, now {{numbering}} around 700, {{was stationed}} {{on the slopes}} of Uhud, facing Medina with the rear being protected by the towering mount itself. Before the battle, Muhammad had assigned 50 archers on a nearby rocky hill at the West side of the Muslim camp. This was a strategic decision in order to shield the vulnerable flanks of the outnumbered Muslim army; the archers on the hill were to protect the left flank, while the right flank was to be protected by the Mount of Uhud situated {{on the east side of}} the Muslim camp. Protecting the flanks of the Muslim army meant that the Meccan army would not be able to turn around the Muslim camp, and thus the Muslim army wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>surrounded</b> or encircled by the Meccan cavalry, keeping in mind that the Meccan cavalry outnumbered the Muslim cavalry with a 50:1 ratio.|$|E
2500|$|Spread over a hillside, {{the complex}} <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by cedar trees, some [...] tall and {{as old as}} the temple. It <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by bright green moss-covered boulders, and Japanese maples that turn red and gold during autumn.|$|R
50|$|The Justizwache corps badge {{shows the}} Austrian coat of arms, which <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a {{circular}} enclosure. It thus deviates only marginally from the corps badge of the Federal Police, {{in which the}} Bundeswappen <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by an oak leaf wreath.|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} day, 9 September, {{the party}} visited the races, where the prince's horse won the Clumber Stakes. After dinner the prince once again {{wanted to play}} baccarat {{and asked for a}} chalk line to be drawn on the baize, six inches from the edge, behind which players were to keep their counters when not placing their stake. Edward was banker and Williams acted as the croupier. When Gordon-Cumming arrived at the table, there were only two vacant seats. At either of them, Gordon-Cumming would <b>be</b> <b>surrounded</b> by members of the Wilson family, all of whom had been informed of Stanley and Levett's suspicions.|$|E
5|$|We give an acre for a cow or sheep willingly, {{while we}} shut our {{children}} and our chickens up in too limited spaces, and they suffer in consequence. Schools of the future must be provided with estates where the children will <b>be</b> <b>surrounded</b> with many natural and beautiful things. Part of the practical work was growing food for the school. In 1944 the daily two-course dinner, for staff and over 90 students, was mostly the school's farm's produce. After the war, from c.1948–55, the school received child migrants from Belgium, Greece and the United Kingdom. The school was known as Hagley State School until 1936, Hagley Farm School until 1976 and Hagley Farm Primary School since.|$|E
5|$|After the CIA clears them, {{they return}} to England to attend the wedding of Baxter's eldest daughter. Rick reveals he sold Alvo's villa and signed the others' name without permission. Although the others {{initially}} resent Rick for this, the four become wealthy as a result. Two months later {{they return to}} Cape Town to visit Quinn's villa, where Baxter and Carmen reunite. Meanwhile, a wheelchair-bound Dominic tracks the four down and arrives with his gang, with all members wearing Blair masks. After initially evading the gang, Baxter accidentally kills Carmen, mistaking her for an assassin. The four drive to one of Rick's contacts at a beach, only to <b>be</b> <b>surrounded</b> and executed by the gang upon arrival. In a state of Limbo, their souls leave the beach. Baxter spots one of the assassins, who removes the Blair mask to reveal a sinister version of himself. Their car drives past an unfinished interchange, and it plunges, where the four would meet their end.|$|E
