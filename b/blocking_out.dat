5|$|Smith's script, titled Superman Lives, had Brainiac sending Doomsday to kill Superman, {{as well as}} <b>blocking</b> <b>out</b> the sun to make Superman powerless, as Superman {{is fueled}} by sunlight. Brainiac teams up with Lex Luthor, but Superman is resurrected by a Kryptonian robot, the Eradicator. Brainiac wishes to possess the Eradicator and its technology. Powerless, the resurrected Superman is {{sheathed}} in a robotic suit formed from the Eradicator itself until his powers return, courtesy of sunbeams, and defeats Brainiac. Smith's casting choices included Ben Affleck as Clark Kent/Superman, Linda Fiorentino as Lois Lane, Jack Nicholson as Lex Luthor, Famke Janssen as Mercy, John Mahoney as Perry White, David Hyde Pierce as the Eradicator, Jason Lee as Brainiac and Jason Mewes as Jimmy Olsen.|$|E
5|$|Harmonia {{is set in}} a post-apocalyptic world {{sometime}} in the future. A rapid decline in human civilization began once the population hit its peak of 10 billion, caused in part by pollution and war. During this time, artificially intelligent, emotional androids called Phiroids were developed to serve as partners for humans. Although Phiroids were originally powered by batteries for the first two generations, they were afterwards developed to be powered by eating food, making them nearly indistinguishable from humans. Artificial memories could also be implanted into the Phiroids, making them highly desirable, leading them to be produced in numbers that eventually rivaled the human population {{at a time when the}} birth rate was already in decline. Eventually, nuclear warfare and the resulting nuclear fallout killed off most of humanity, culminating in a world covered in dark clouds and ash <b>blocking</b> <b>out</b> sunlight, land stripped of vegetation, and an ocean that could no longer support life. Some people were placed in cryogenic facilities in an attempt to sleep long enough until the environment improved even a little bit.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} known examples of companion planting is the growing of rice with Azolla, the mosquito fern, which covers {{the top of a}} fresh rice paddy's water, <b>blocking</b> <b>out</b> any competing plants, as well as fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere for the rice to use. The rice is planted when it is tall enough to poke out above the azolla. This method has been used for at least a thousand years.|$|E
25|$|Citing {{contractual}} obligations to deliver an R rating, Warner Bros. digitally altered the orgy for the American release, <b>blocking</b> <b>out</b> graphic sexuality by inserting additional figures {{to obscure the}} view, avoiding an adults-only NC-17 rating that limited distribution, as some large American theaters and video store operators disallow films with that rating. This alteration antagonized film critics and cinephiles, as they argued that Kubrick had never been shy about ratings (A Clockwork Orange was originally given an X-rating). The unrated version of Eyes Wide Shut was released in the United States on October 23, 2007, in DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray Disc formats.|$|E
25|$|As a {{consequence}} of its observing the Sun, SOHO (specifically the LASCO instrument) has inadvertently allowed the discovery of comets by <b>blocking</b> <b>out</b> the Sun's glare. Approximately one-half of all known comets have been spotted by SOHO, discovered over the last 15 years by over 70 people representing 18 different countries searching through the publicly available SOHO images online. Michał Kusiak of the Polish Jagiellonian University (Uniwersytet Jagielloński) discovered SOHO's 1999th and 2000th comets on 26 December 2010. , SOHO has discovered over 2700 comets, with an average discovery rate of every 2.59 days. In September 2015, SOHO discovered its 3000th comet.|$|E

Gillani emphasised the role of Pakistan's media and encouraged the film, drama, and national performing art industry to promote national spirit in the country. In 2011, after the Secret Pakistan went on-air, Gillani ordered the <b>blocking</b> <b>out</b> of the BBC World and banned the channel in the country. Banning of BBC World deeply concerned the BBC authorities and the BBC executives immediately met with Gillani to resolve the issue.

25|$|Altered {{auditory}} feedback, so {{that people}} who stutter hear their voice differently, {{has been used for}} over 50 years in the treatment of stuttering. Altered auditory feedback effect can be produced by speaking in chorus with another person, by <b>blocking</b> <b>out</b> the person who stutters' voice while talking (masking), by delaying slightly the voice of the person who stutters (delayed auditory feedback) or by altering the frequency of the feedback (frequency altered feedback). Studies of these techniques have had mixed results, with some people who stutter showing substantial reductions in stuttering, while others improved only slightly or not at all. In a 2006 review of the efficacy of stuttering treatments, none of the studies on altered auditory feedback met the criteria for experimental quality, such as the presence of control groups.|$|E

Xavier once again reads Magneto's thoughts, this time learning the full details of his plan. Magneto plans to redirect the passing Scorpio comet onto {{a collision course with}} Earth. This would send up a cloud of dust and debris, <b>blocking</b> <b>out</b> the Sun for years, plunging the planet into another Ice Age, which would leave normal humans weakened, allowing the mutants to take over. The X-Men leave at once for Magneto's orbiting sanctuary Asteroid M, but the X-Men instruct Kitty to stay, as the mission is far too dangerous and she has not been trained. Kitty, however, wanting to prove her worth and make amends for her previous failure, phases aboard the Blackbird and hides, with the Professor's blessing.|$|E

It was released on January 7, 2016, as the album's lead single. Brian Kennedy produced the track and co-wrote it along with Paris Jones and Lance Eric Shipp. With a synths, snares and organ backing, the mid-tempo song's lyrics center on <b>blocking</b> <b>out</b> drama and negativity in favor of professional and financial success.

The suggestion that global firestorms occurred is debated, however, with opponents arguing that while ferocious fires probably did result locally, ferocious fires do not necessarily equal firestorms, and any such ferocious fires were instead limited to the immediate American continent.

On this album the band captured a quite depressing {{picture of the}} reality of life in Serbia. This album was proclaimed as the best Serbian rock album of 1998 by some of the critics, but also as one of the all-time best albums in Serbian rock. Meanwhile, video clips for <b>Block</b> <b>Outs</b> songs, created by singer Jovančić, started to become one more symbol of <b>Block</b> <b>Outs</b> originality.

In the chorus, [...] "You wanna tell me how it is, but there’s no time for it / You wanna {{tell me how you}} feel, but there's no time for it"; Fantasia sings in [...] "a cool collected manner", contrasting with her biting lyrics. Idolator's Mike Wass described the song as a [...] "catchy mid-tempo anthem" [...] and its lyrics, such as [...] "Bitch, no time for the haters tripping", as exemplifying that [...] "Fantasia has always been the realest". Her vocal delivery was described as [...] "a combination acid-rosewater solution" [...] and the lyrics [...] "Do you thing, get your change / By the way you don't think I'ma care cause I'm not" [...] classified as [...] "a slow jam with a score to settle", with Fantasia [...] "warn a clueless second party that bad behavior will no longer be tolerated".|$|E
500|$|Jaws 3-D had two 3D consultants: the {{production}} started with Chris Condon, president of StereoVision, and Stan Loth was later {{added to the}} team for the Arrivision 3D. Production began using the StereoVision, but this was dropped after {{a week for the}} Arrivision system, [...] "which Alves believed was a superior system because it has a wider variety of lenses". According to Alves, inferior systems lead to ghosting and blurring, leaving audiences with headaches. He says that [...] "the left and right images [...] are very well-matched, and the photography is very clean; it's restful to the eye, and though we do have the occasional effects where things do emerge toward the audience from the plane of projection, you come out of the film without a headache." [...] Historian R. M. Hayes says that the film was shot using both the Arrivision and StereoVision single strip-over-and-under units. Both cameras were used in conjunction with each other. This is a means of shooting 3D movies in normal color with a single camera and single strip of film: the Arrivision 3D technique uses a special twin-lens adapter fitted to the film camera, and divides the 35mm film frame in half along the middle, capturing the left-eye image in the upper half of the frame and the right-eye image in the lower half – this is known as [...] "over/under". This allows filming to proceed as for any standard 2D film, without the considerable additional expense of having to double up on cameras and film stock for every shot. When the resultant film is projected through a normal projector (albeit one requiring a special lens that combines the upper and lower images), a true polarised 3D image is produced. This system allows 3D films to be shown in almost any cinema since it does not require two projectors running simultaneously through the presentation – something most cinemas are not equipped to handle. What is required of the theatre is both the special projection lens and a reflective [...] "silver" [...] screen to enable the polarized images to reflect back to the viewer with the appropriate filter on each eye <b>blocking</b> <b>out</b> the wrong image, thus leaving the viewer to see the film from two angles as the eyes naturally see the world. According to the company that built the underwater camera housings for Jaws 3-D, the underwater sequences were shot using an Arriflex 35–3 camera with Arrivision 18mm over/under 3D lens.|$|E

The proposed Union Station was located in the heart of what was Los Angeles' original Chinatown. Reflecting the prejudice of the time, the anti-railroad Los Angeles Times, a lead opponent of elevated railways, argued in editorials that Union Station would not be built in the “midst of Chinatown” but rather would “forever do away with Chinatown and its environs.” [...] The Times also attacked the elevateds for <b>blocking</b> <b>out</b> the California sun and in general being antithetical to the ethos of Los Angeles.|$|E
