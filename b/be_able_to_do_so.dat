5|$|A popular product, {{with a lower}} screen {{resolution}} and performance than the two Retina models that followed it but a lighter build and longer battery life, it remained in the Apple line-up as an entry-level iPad model for three years until March 2014, latterly with a silent upgrade to a die-shrunk version of the A5 processor. Its basic design formed {{the core of the}} first iPad mini, which had the same screen pixel count and similar features at a smaller size. The iPad 2 has been able to run six major versions of iOS, from 4 to 9, the only iOS device to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> The iPhone 4S is a close second with support from iOS 5 to iOS 9, as well as the iPhone 5, which was supported from iOS 6 to iOS 10.|$|E
5|$|During the {{beginning}} of World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had re-introduced the draft (conscription) in September 1940, and Koval registered for it on January 2, 1941. Raven Electric Company secured him a year's deferment from service until February 1942. According to historian Vladimir Lota, Koval's handlers wanted him to steal information about chemical weapons, and felt {{that he would not}} <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> while drafted. When the deferment expired, Koval was inducted into the United States Army. He received basic training at Fort Dix in New Jersey before being sent to the Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina. There, Koval served as a private in the 3410th Specialized Training and Reassignment Unit. On August 11, 1943, he was transferred to the Army Specialized Training Program, a unit established in December 1942 to provide talented enlistees with an education and technical training. Koval attended the City College of New York (CCNY) and studied electrical engineering. His CCNY classmates looked up to the older Koval as a role model and father figure who never did homework and was a noted ladies' man, never knowing about his Soviet education and wife. Colleagues recalled that he never discussed politics or the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Players {{have access}} to a {{communication}} system {{that can be used to}} contact other starfighters, which has more impact in the game's single-player mode. Through the system, the player can order either a single starfighter, a wing, or all craft (depending on how many are still active), with tasks such as taking down a player's target, covering the player, or engaging all hostiles, amongst other commands. The system can also be used to call in for reinforcements (if available), and requesting deployment of a support ship to repair a player's subsystems as well as re-arm their secondary weapons; the support ship can be given limited orders when deployed. Furthermore, a player can manage the energy input of certain subsystems, thus affecting how efficient it is in battle; changing the input for engines, for example, changes the max speed of the craft and the time needed to fully recharge the ship's afterburners. The controls for the game in both modes are designed so that players have ease with controlling their starfighter and its systems, and <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> with either a joystick, or a keyboard (on its own or with a mouse). Because of the flexibility in controls, some have categorised Descent: FreeSpace as a flight simulator, since it has more controls and commands than a typical arcade game, yet its flight model is simple, akin to that of the game , and incorporates some elements of Newtonian physics such as precise collision physics.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} {{of life in}} extreme conditions has complicated definitions of habitability, but also generated much excitement amongst researchers in greatly broadening the known range of conditions under which life can persist. For example, a planet {{that might otherwise be}} unable to support an atmosphere given the solar conditions in its vicinity, might <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> within a deep shadowed rift or volcanic cave. Similarly, craterous terrain might offer a refuge for primitive life. The Lawn Hill crater has been studied as an astrobiological analog, with researchers suggesting rapid sediment infill created a protected microenvironment for microbial organisms; similar conditions may have occurred over the geological history of Mars.|$|E
25|$|The {{result in}} Arlington Heights {{was similar to}} that in Washington v.

It is possible for a discriminating state to hide its true intention, and one possible solution is for disparate impact to be considered as stronger evidence of discriminatory intent. This debate, though, is currently academic, since the Supreme Court has not changed its basic approach as outlined in Arlington Heights.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of a}} {{proposed}} Equality Bill, Harman announced a consultation on changing the existing discrimination laws, including options for reverse discrimination in employment.

Employers would not be required to use these powers, but would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> without the threat of legal action for discriminatory practices. The white paper also proposed measures to end age discrimination, promote transparency in organisations and introduce a new equality duty on the public sector.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{lines that}} delineated an EMT from a Paramedic and a Paramedic {{from a doctor}} are becoming increasingly blurred. Skills that were once reserved for physicians are now routinely performed by paramedics, and skills once reserved for paramedics, such as defibrillation, are now routinely performed by Basic Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs). However, there is wide variation among states, and even among counties within states, of what type of care providers at different levels are allowed to provide. In addition to these variations, some states and counties allow for add-ons, such as defibrillation or IV therapy, which enable workers at a lower level to learn and use additional skills that would not normally be {{within the scope of}} practice of their qualification level (for example, an EMT is not generally permitted to start an IV, but after successfully completing an IV add-on course, he or she would then <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.)</b> Add-on skills are generally more common in rural areas where definitive care is further away geographically and immediate interventions by EMTs are beneficial for patient care.|$|E
25|$|Lewis' efforts {{convinced}} {{most members}} of Congress and relevant administration officials that the women's groups represented only {{a small minority of}} Southerners. He did so in part by winning the support of other key Southern groups. First he won over his own organization, the United Confederate Veterans, which in March 1901 unanimously passed resolutions asking the government to proceed with creation of the Confederate section. He also won the support of the Ladies Southern Relief Society, an important Confederate women's group in Washington, D.C. Lewis also won over Congress and the administration by undermining the UDC and CSMA's opposition to the reburial plan. Once more working through his own veterans' group, the UCV convinced a number of government officials that the CSMA was too new (just a year old) to accurately represent Southern views. Lewis dampened the outcry by the CSMA and other ladies' memorial associations by convincing them that their importance in the South would be maintained. Lewis realized that these groups continued to thrive in part because they set the dates for and organized Civil War commemorations. Lewis convinced the CSMA and many Southern women's groups that they would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> at Arlington as well, which would enhance their prestige. These tactics worked: In the late spring of 1901, a delegation from several Confederate veterans' groups visited Secretary of War Elihu Root and convinced him to proceed with the reburials at Arlington.|$|E

500|$|Bamboo shoots {{are more}} easily digested than leaves, exhibiting the highest {{digestibility}} in summer and autumn, intermediate digestibility in the spring, and lowest digestibility in the winter. These variations correlate with the nutrient contents in the bamboo. Red pandas process bamboo poorly, especially the cellulose and cell wall components. This implies microbial digestion plays only a minor role in their digestive strategy. To survive on this poor-quality diet, they have to eat the high-quality sections of the bamboo plant, such as the tender leaves and shoots, in large quantities, over [...] of fresh leaves and [...] of fresh shoots daily. This food passes through the digestive tract fairly rapidly (about 2–4 hr) so as to maximize daily nutrient intake.

500|$|Patton {{asked for}} a command in the Pacific Theater of Operations, begging Marshall {{to bring him to}} that war in any way possible, and Marshall said he would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> only if the Chinese secured a major port for his entry, an {{unlikely}} scenario. In mid-May, Patton flew to Paris, then London for rest. On June 7, he arrived in Bedford, Massachusetts, for extended leave with his family, and was greeted by thousands of spectators. Patton then drove to Hatch Memorial Shell and spoke to some 20,000, including a crowd of 400 wounded Third Army veterans. In this speech he aroused some controversy among the Gold Star Mothers when he stated that a man who dies in battle is [...] "frequently a fool", adding that the wounded are heroes. Patton spent time in Boston before visiting and speaking in Denver and visiting Los Angeles, where he spoke to a crowd of 100,000 at the Memorial Coliseum. Patton made a final stop in Washington before returning to Europe in July to serve in the occupation forces.|$|E
500|$|Early {{traditions and}} stories explain this verse as a miracle {{performed}} by Muhammad, following requests of {{some members of}} the Quraysh. Most Muslim commentators accept the authenticity of those traditions. The following verse 54:2, [...] "But if they see a Sign, they turn away, and say, 'This is (but) transient magic'" [...] is taken in the support of this view. The classical commentator Ibn Kathir provides a list of the early traditions mentioning the incident: A tradition transmitted on the authority of Anas bin Malik states that Muhammad split the moon after the pagan Meccans asked for a miracle. Another tradition from Malik transmitted through other chains of narrations, mentions that the mount Nur was visible between the two parts of the moon (Mount Nur is located in Hijaz. Muslims believe that Muhammad received his first revelations from God in a cave on this mountain, Cave Hira'). A tradition narrated on the authority of Jubayr ibn Mut'im with a single chain of transmission says that the two parts of the moon stood on two mountains. This tradition further states that the Meccan responded by saying [...] "Muhammad has taken us by his magic... If he was able to take us by magic, he will not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> with all people."
