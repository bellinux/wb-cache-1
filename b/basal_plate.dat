5|$|Planted bulbs are {{susceptible}} to nematodes, the most serious of which is Ditylenchus dipsaci (Narcissus eelworm), {{the main cause of}} <b>basal</b> <b>plate</b> disease in which the leaves turn yellow and become misshapen. Infested bulbs have to be destroyed; where infestation is heavy avoiding planting further narcissi for another five years. Other nematodes include Aphelenchoides subtenuis, which penetrates the roots causing <b>basal</b> <b>plate</b> disease and Pratylenchus penetrans (lesion nematode) the main cause of root rot in narcissi.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{commercial}} propagation method {{is referred to}} as 'twin scales'. This involves the division of the bulb into 12 sections and then separating each section into twin scales connected by the <b>basal</b> <b>plate.</b> The cuttings that are derived from these are grown in moist vermiculite in the dark till bulbils appear. More recently growing them in sunlight produce a better crop.|$|E
5|$|Bulbs {{offered for}} sale are {{referred}} to as either 'round' or 'double nose'. Round bulbs are circular in cross section and produce a single flower stem, while double nose bulbs have more than one bulb stem attached at the base and produce two or more flower stems, but bulbs with more than two stems are unusual. Planted narcissi bulbs produce daughter bulbs in the axil of the bulb scales, leading to the dying off of the exterior scales. To prevent planted bulbs forming more and more small bulbs, they can be dug up every 5–7 years, and the daughters separated and replanted separately, provided that a piece of the <b>basal</b> <b>plate,</b> where the rootlets are formed, is preserved. For daffodils to flower {{at the end of the}} winter or early spring, bulbs are planted in autumn (September–November). This plant does well in ordinary soil but flourishes best in rich soil. Daffodils like the sun but also accepts partial shade exposure.|$|E
5|$|The pale brown-skinned ovoid {{tunicate}} bulbs have a membranous {{tunic and}} a corky stem (base or <b>basal)</b> <b>plate</b> from which arise the adventitious root hairs {{in a ring}} around the edge, which grow up to 40mm in length. Above the stem plate is the storage organ consisting of bulb scales, surrounding the previous flower stalk and the terminal bud. The scales are of two types, true storage organs and the bases of the foliage leaves. These have a thicker tip and a scar from where the leaf lamina became detached. The innermost leaf scale is semicircular only partly enveloping the flower stalk (semisheathed).(see Hanks Fig 1.3). The bulb may contain a number of branched bulb units, each with two to three true scales and two to three leaf bases. Each bulb unit has a life of about four years.|$|E

50|$|The ventral part of {{the mantle}} layer (the <b>basal</b> <b>plates)</b> forms the motor areas of the spinal cord, whilst the dorsal part (the alar plates) forms the sensory areas. Between the <b>basal</b> and alar <b>plates</b> is an {{intermediate}} layer that contains neurons of the autonomic nervous system.|$|R
50|$|It is now {{assumed that}} Gnathostomata evolved from {{ancestors}} that already possessed {{a pair of}} both pectoral and pelvic fins. In addition to this, some placoderms were also shown to have a third pair of paired appendages, that in males had been modified to claspers and <b>basal</b> <b>plates</b> in females, a pattern not seen in any other vertebrate group.|$|R
25|$|Alpha motor neurons {{originate}} in the <b>basal</b> <b>plate,</b> the ventral portion of the neural tube in the developing embryo. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is secreted by the nearby notochord and other ventral structures (e.g., the floor plate), establishing a gradient of highly concentrated Shh in the <b>basal</b> <b>plate</b> and less concentrated Shh in the alar plate. Under the influence of Shh and other factors, some neurons of the <b>basal</b> <b>plate</b> differentiate into α-MNs.|$|E
25|$|The motor {{division}} of the trigeminal nerve derives from the <b>basal</b> <b>plate</b> of the embryonic pons, and the sensory division originates in the cranial neural crest. Sensory information from the face and body is processed by parallel pathways in the central nervous system.|$|E
25|$|A more {{complicated}} form of epigyne {{is found in}} spiders of the genus Araneus, where there is developed an appendage which is usually soft and flexible, and which is termed the scape or ovipositor. When there is a well-developed scape, the tip of it is usually more or less spoon-shaped. This part of the scape is termed the cochlear. The <b>basal</b> <b>plate</b> of the epigyne which bears the scape, and which forms a porch or hood that covers {{the opening of the}} oviduct is called the atriolum.|$|E
40|$|Ophryotrocha labronica, as {{typical for}} Eunicida, has a complex jaw {{apparatus}} consisting of ventral mandibles and dorsal maxillae. Mandibles are not replaced but are retained throughout life. Larval mandibles have adult-sized cutting plates but their proximal shafts lengthen and enlarge as the worm grows. The maxillary apparatus of O. labronica undergoes three moults or replacements. The initial, or larval maxillae, {{consisting of two}} paired <b>basal</b> <b>plates</b> and two paired free denticles, develop in the unreleased larvae. They are replaced in the 5 -setiger juvenile by the P 1 -maxillae consisting of falcate forceps and six denticles. The second moult occurs in the 8 - to 9 -setiger juveniles and results in the P 2 -maxillae with bidentate forceps and seven denticles, and {{the third and final}} moult results in the K-maxillae and seven denticles. The K-maxillae develop in 9 - to 12 -setiger males and 13 - to 15 -setiger females and are not replaced but enlarge proximally. Thus the K-forceps can be traced back through the P 2 -forceps, P 1 -forceps, to the larval <b>basal</b> <b>plates,</b> indicating the apomorphic state of the K-forceps. Three pulp cavities, separated by darker fusion lines are visible in weakly sclerotised young K-forceps suggesting the fusion of three separate elements. It is concluded that the Ophryotrocha forceps are homologous to the superior and probably inferior <b>basal</b> <b>plates</b> of other dorvilleids. The internal structure of the Ophryotrocha forceps demonstrates that they are not homologous to the labidognath maxilla I as has been suggested. 8 page(s...|$|R

An alternative is to cut the top off the bulb, coat the cloves by dribbling olive oil (or other oil-based seasoning) over them, and roast them in an oven.

40|$|Traditionally, the {{classification}} of bees has been conducted {{with the aid of}} dissecting (light) microscopy. In more recent times, detailed information on external and internal morphology for bee classification has been obtained using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. MicroCT is emerging as a new method for non-invasive 3 D computerised X-ray tomographic imaging of insects at the microscopic level, and in this study has been evaluated for its use in morphological studies of bees. A Skyscan 1172 MicroCT system was used to assess the internal and external morphology of the Australian stingless bee Trigona carbonaria with particular focus on the proventricular plates. MicroCT was useful in non-invasively visualising gross external morphological features such as the articulations of the coxae, trochanters, tibiae and tarsi of each leg including broadened hind basitarsi. Image magnification revealed further detail such as antennal scapes and the various parts of the tongue including the proboscis and labia. However, the individual facets of the eye were barely discernable and MicroCT did not reveal fine details of hairs on the body or legs. Internal morphology was clearly visualised, including the tracheal system and details of the proventriculus and proventricular <b>basal</b> <b>plates</b> which form the leaflets of the proventricular valve. Thus, the characteristic features of the proventricular <b>basal</b> <b>plates</b> of Meliponini could be quickly and easily identified non-invasively. Therefore, MicroCT, as one of the emerging techniques of diagnostic radioentomology, has particular advantages for non-invasively and non-destructively imaging bees and, particularly, rare or more scientifically valued insects such as museum specimens and those trapped in amber...|$|R

40|$|The diverse {{neuronal}} subtypes in {{the adult}} central nervous system arise from progenitor cells specified by the combined actions of anteroposterior (AP) and dorsoventral (DV) signaling molecules in the neural tube.

Hoxb 1 accomplishes this function by acting very early during hindbrain neurogenesis to specify effectors of the sonic hedgehog and Mash 1 signaling pathways. In the absence of Hoxb 1 function, multiple neurons normally specified within r 4 are instead programmed for early cell death.
