50|$|The Consumer Federation of America {{and other}} {{commentators}} suggested securities firms had avoided becoming “financial holding companies” {{because they wanted}} to avoid Federal Reserve supervision as <b>bank</b> <b>holding</b> <b>companies.</b> The SEC (through its Chairman Arthur Levitt) had supported efforts to permit securities firms to engage in non-FDIC insured banking activities without the Federal Reserve’s “intrusive banking-style oversight” of the “overall holding company.” After the GLBA became law, securities firms continued (and expanded) their deposit and lending activities through the “unitary thrifts” and “nonbank banks” (particularly industrial loan companies) they had used before the GLBA to avoid regulation as <b>bank</b> <b>holding</b> <b>companies.</b> Alan Greenspan later noted securities firms only took on the “embrace” of Federal Reserve Board supervision as <b>bank</b> <b>holding</b> <b>companies</b> (and financial <b>holding</b> <b>companies)</b> after the financial crisis climaxed in September 2008.|$|R
