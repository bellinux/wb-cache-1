5|$|At Marsh's urging, Powell {{pushed for}} Cope to return {{specimens}} he had unearthed during his employment under the government surveys. This was an outrage to Cope, {{who had used}} his own money {{while working as a}} volunteer. In response, Cope went to the editor of the New York Herald and promised a scandalous headline. Since 1885, Cope had kept an elaborate journal of mistakes and misdeeds that both Marsh and Powell had committed over the years. From scientific errors to publishing mistakes, he had them written down in a journal he kept in the <b>bottom</b> <b>drawer</b> of his Pine Street desk. Cope sought out Marsh's assistants, who complained of being denied access and credit by their employer and of being chronically underpaid. Reporter William Hosea Ballou ran the first article on January 12, 1890, in what would become a series of newspaper debates between Marsh, Powell, and Cope. Cope attacked Marsh for plagiarism and financial mismanagement, and attacked Powell for his geological classification errors and misspending of government-allocated funds. Marsh and Powell published their own side of the story and, in the end, little changed. No congressional hearing was created to investigate Powell's alleged misallocation of funds, while Cope and Marsh were not held responsible for any mistakes. Indirectly, however, the attacks may have been influential in Marsh's fall from power in the survey. Due to pressure from Powell over bad press, Marsh was removed from his position for the government surveys. Cope's relations {{with the president of the}} University of Pennsylvania soured, and the entire funding for paleontology in the government surveys was pulled.|$|E

The human being {{is considered}} {{to be the most important}} knowledge provider. Over the years knowledge based systems (KBS) have been developed to capture and nurture the knowledge of domain experts. However, such systems were considered to be separate and different from the traditional information systems development. Many KBS development projects have failed. The main causes for such failures have been recognised as the difficulties associated with the process of knowledge elicitation, in particular the techniques and methods employed. On the other hand, the main emphasis of information systems development has been in the areas of data and information capture relating to transaction based systems. For knowledge to be effectively captured and nurtured it is necessary for knowledge to be part of the information systems development activity.

He sat down, and pulled out bodily the <b>bottom</b> <b>drawer</b> on the right inside of {{the upper part of}} the desk, as he had seen Lord Ostermore do that day, a little over a week ago. He thrust his hand into the opening, and felt along the sides for some moments in vain. He went over the ground again slowly, inch by inch, exerting constant pressure, until he was suddenly rewarded by a click. The small trap disclosed itself. He pulled it up, and took some papers from the recess. He spread them before him. They were the documents he sought--the king's letter to Ostermore, and Ostermore's reply, signed and ready for dispatch.

It was not that her Monnerie raiment was particularly flattering, or she, indeed, pleasanter to look at--rather the contrary: and I gazed long and earnestly into the glass. But art has furtive and bewitching fingers. While in my home-made clothes I had looked just myself, in these I looked like one or other of my guardian angels, or perhaps, as an unprejudiced Fleming would have expressed it--the perfect lady. How gradual must have been the change in me to have passed thus unnoticed. But I didn't want to think. I felt dulled and dispirited. Even Mrs Bowater had not been so entranced to see me as I had anticipated. It was tiresome to be disappointed. I rummaged in a <b>bottom</b> <b>drawer,</b> got out an old gown, made a grimace at myself in my mind, and sat down to Fanny's letter. But then again, what are externals?

60|$|Drawer upon drawer {{she opened}} and shut wearily, but nothing that her eyes fell upon seemed to suit her mood. Dresses and jackets and underlinen were there; {{she glanced at}} them all with {{a deep sense of}} {{profound}} contempt; none of these gewgaws of civilized life could be of any use to supply the vague want her soul felt so dimly and yet so acutely. They were dead, dead, dead, so close and clinging! Go further! Go further! At last she opened the <b>bottom</b> <b>drawer</b> of all, and her eye fell askance upon a feather boa, curled up at the bottom--soft, smooth, and long; a winding, coiling, serpentine boa. In a second, she had fallen upon it bodily with greedy hands, and was twisting it round her waist, and holding it high and low, and fighting fiercely at times, and figuring with it like a posturant. Some dormant impulse of her race seemed to stir in her blood, with frantic leaps and bounds, at its first conscious awakening. She gave herself up to it wildly now. She was mad. She was mad. She was glad. She was happy.|$|E

Neither {{said a word to}} the other of what she thought or felt. But their mute sympathy itself made them more shame-faced than ever. In some dim, indefinite, instinctive fashion, Elma knew her mother was vaguely aware what she had done last night. Her gaze fell half unconsciously on the <b>bottom</b> <b>drawer.</b> With quick insight, Mrs. Clifford's eye {{followed}} her daughter's. Then it fell as before. Elma looked up at her terrified, and burst into a sudden flood of tears. Her mother stooped down and caught her wildly in her arms. [...] "Cry, cry, my darling," [...] ahe murmured, clasping her hard to her breast. [...] "Cry, cry; it'll do you good; there's safety in crying. Nobody but I shall come near you to-day.

5000|$|Vimes' firm {{grasp of}} basic human nature, {{and of the}} Ankh-Morpork psyche in particular, led to him {{spending}} some years as a drunk, and Sergeant Fred Colon postulates that this was because Vimes' body didn't produce any [...] "natural alcohol", and he estimates that Vimes was about [...] "two drinks below par". This meant that when he hadn't been drinking, he was beyond sober - he was [...] "knurd". Thus he saw reality as it really was ("first sight"); stripped of all the mental illusions that most people construct in their minds to get {{to sleep at night}} ("second sight"). This horrifying state of mind caused Vimes to try to balance it out through drinking, but he would get the dosage wrong and would just end up drunk. Vimes gave up alcohol after his marriage to Sybil, and now smokes foul-smelling cigars instead. He still keeps a bottle of 'Bearhugger's Whisky' in his <b>bottom</b> desk <b>drawer</b> as a 'permanent test'.|$|R

But of course he must fully understand that it is what we want, not what he thinks, that is important. I told him you said I could have my room exactly as I liked it myself; and I have explained to him my ideas. He seemed at first to be under the impression that I didn't know what I was talking about, so I made it quite clear to him that I did, with the result that he has consented to carry out my instructions, on condition that I put them down in black and white--which I think just as well, as then there can be no excuse afterwards for argument. I like him better than I did the first time. About everything else he can be fairly amiable. It is when he talks about 'frontal elevations' and 'ground plans' that he irritates me.
