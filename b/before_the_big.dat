When racing resumed in March 1963, Cazalet had two winners at Newbury on 8 March and four the next day. In the 1964–65 season, Cazalet had a record 82 winners. By 1967, he had had his one thousandth winner. His final runner was Soundless at Doncaster on 24 March 1973.|$|E
25|$|Though George's 4:12¾ was impressive, he ran {{some time}} trials in 1885 which were truly remarkable. In the first, {{two weeks before}} his {{professional}} debut against Cummings, he ran a 4:14½. Then, in Surbiton several days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> race, he ran against some local runners with handicaps. His splits were 58, 1:58 and 3:07. He finished in a startling 4:10. Not believing their watches, the track was immediately measured. He had run six yards too far. No man would run the mile faster until 1931.|$|E
25|$|Unique in the {{domestic}} automotive industry, AMC offered adjustable front seat backrests from their Nash-origin, and in 1964, the Classic and Ambassador were equipped with standard dual reclining front seats nearly a decade <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Three offered them as options. Bendix disc brakes were made standard on the Marlin and optional on other models in 1965. This made the Marlin one the first modern American cars with standard disc brakes, while the Big Three did not offer them until the early 1970s on most of their models to meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.|$|E

25|$|A {{major reason}} for the all-day {{congestion}} was that the Central Artery carried not only north–south traffic, but much east–west traffic as well. Boston's Logan Airport lies across Boston Harbor in East Boston, and <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Dig the only access from downtown was through the paired Callahan and Sumner tunnels. Traffic on the major highways from west of Boston—the Massachusetts Turnpike and Storrow Drive—mostly traveled on portions of the Central Artery to reach these tunnels. Getting between the Central Artery and the tunnels involved short diversions onto city streets, increasing local congestion.|$|E
25|$|Flight of the Migrator {{continues}} {{the story of}} the final living human being, the colonist on Mars, and his decision to go even further back in time. Using the Dream Sequencer machine, he travels {{all the way back to}} just before the Universe was formed, theoretically <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Bang, when there was nothing but chaos. The colonist observes the creation of the very first soul, known as the Universal Migrator. It is from this soul that all others are formed, through a division of the original soul. Each resulting soul then travels off into the Universe to bring life in some form to the planet they inhabit.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Penrose {{reported}} possible evidence, {{based on}} concentric circles found in WMAP {{data of the}} CMB sky, of an earlier universe existing <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Bang of our own present universe. He mentions this evidence in the epilogue of his 2010 book Cycles of Time, a book in which he presents his reasons, to do with Einstein's field equations, the Weyl curvature C, and the Weyl curvature hypothesis, that the transition at the Big Bang could have been smooth enough for a previous universe to survive it. He made several conjectures about C and the WCH, {{some of which were}} subsequently proved by others, and the smoothness is real, and where he also popularized his conformal cyclic cosmology (CCC) theory.|$|E

500|$|George's {{incarnation}} as Lieutenant The Honourable George Colthurst St. Barleigh MC, in Blackadder Goes Forth, is a frontline officer [...] strongly reminiscent in both {{manner and}} personality of Bertie Wooster (as whom Laurie would later {{go on to}} appear). General Melchett (played by Stephen Fry, also later of Jeeves & Wooster), intimates to Captain Darling that he and George's [...] "Great Uncle Bertie" [...] used to [...] "break wind" [...] for their college. George joined the army {{on the first day}} of World War I, along with nine other students at Cambridge University. The ten men named themselves the Trinity College tiddlywinks, or the [...] "Trinity Tiddlers". It is revealed later, in the fourth series' finale, that George is the only surviving member of the group. Although he lacks any kind of skill, competence, or authority as an officer, his upper-class status and educational background meant he went straight into the commissioned ranks upon enlisting. George is shown to have a special friendship with General Melchett (Fry), an old family friend with whom he shares his public school [...] "tally-ho" [...] attitude towards the war. Melchett even offers George a way out of the trenches for the [...] "final push", which he refuses, much to Blackadder's incredulity. Although George is shown to have benefited from his background of privilege he still remains a generally kind and hopeful individual, and shortly <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> push at the end of the final episode George finally expresses some genuine fear and sadness that he may indeed die.|$|E

Instead of the usual dinner and dance, the evening was filled with a sushi feast and auction.|$|E
2500|$|In cosmology, {{recombination}} {{refers to}} the epoch at which charged electrons and protons first became bound to form electrically neutral hydrogen atoms. Recombination occurred about 378,000 years after the Big Bang (at a redshift of z=). The word [...] "recombination" [...] is misleading, since the big bang theory doesn't posit that protons and electrons had been combined before, but the name exists for historical reasons since it was named <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Bang hypothesis became the primary theory {{of the creation of}} the universe.|$|E

Both the book and the Bogdanovs' television shows have been criticized for elementary scientific inaccuracies. Critics cite examples from Avant Le Big Bang including a statement that the [...] "golden number" [...] φ (Phi) is transcendental, which the Bogdanovs allege to be an editorial misprint; an assumption that the limit of a decreasing sequence is always zero; and that the expansion of the Universe implies that the planets of the Solar System have grown farther apart.|$|E
