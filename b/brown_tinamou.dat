5000|$|The black tinamou is {{a stocky}} {{terrestrial}} bird {{with a short}} tail and rounded wings. It is comparatively larger than other tinamous and tends to be about 40 to(-) 46 cm long, with females being a little larger than males. A male black tinamou has an average wingspan of about 234 to(-) 248 mm, and a female black tinamou has an average wingspan of 239 to(-) 256 mm. While {{there is no record}} of the average mass of a black tinamou, a male specimen weighing 1285 g has been examined at the Field Museum of Natural History. It is primarily slate grey, rather than truly black as its name would imply. The upperparts of an adult black tinamou are a uniform grey, while its midsection and greater wing coverts are sometimes edged with brown. Its lower breasts and flanks are a sooty brown color, as well as its belly. It has a rufescent vent, {{which may or may not}} have black speckling, depending on the subspecies. Its maxilla is black, and its mandible is a light grey. The black tinamou has blue-grey legs and dark brown eyes. An adolescent black tinamou is similar in color, but with whitish spots on the coverts of its wings. Black tinamou chicks generally have a light brown head with a broad, cinnamon-brown stripe extending from the crest of their heads to the napes of their necks. They have whitish throats and chins. Their neck, upper back and upper breast are a dusty <b>brown.</b> A black <b>tinamou</b> chick's lower back and rump is a dirty buff color, and its lower breast and belly range from dusky brown to pale brown.|$|R
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>tinamou</b> {{is located}} in {{northern}} Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, northern and southern Brazil, extreme northeastern Argentina, eastern Bolivia, and eastern Paraguay. They may also be in Uruguay.|$|E
50|$|The Magdalena tinamou {{is similar}} to red-legged tinamou. Its total length is {{approximately}} 27 to(-) 32 cm. It is a medium-sized, <b>brown</b> <b>tinamou.</b> Its upperparts are dark ruddy with black barring on rump, it has brown wings that have buff barring, it has paler underparts with dark barring on its lower flanks and vent, and its chin is white with a greyish tinge to its throat.|$|E
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>tinamou</b> is superficially {{similar to}} a quail, but {{unrelated}} as it, along with other tinamous, belongs in the Paleognathae. It is approximately 25 to(-) 30 cm in length and it weighs about 350 to(-) 550 g. Depending on the subspecies involved, the upperparts vary from dark sooty-brown to bright chestnut and the underparts, which usually are paler than the upperparts, vary from chestnut to light ochraceous. The subspecies griseiventris is unique in having pale buff-grey underparts. All subspecies can {{be separated from the}} superficially similar little tinamou by the greyish (rather than whitish) throat. Females are typically larger and more rufescent than the males.|$|E
40|$|Disentangling {{the role}} of {{competition}} in regulating the distribution of sympatric species can be difficult because species can have different habitat preferences or time use that introduce non-random patterns that {{are not related to}} interspecific interactions. We adopted a multi-step approach to systematically incorporate habitat preferences while investigating the co-occurrence of two presumed competitors, morphologically similar, and closely related ground-dwelling birds: the <b>brown</b> <b>tinamou</b> (Crypturellus obsoletus) and the tataupa tinamou (C. tataupa). First, we used single-species occupancy models to identify the main landscape characteristics affecting site occupancy, while accounting for detection probability. We then used these factors to control for the effect of habitat while investigating species co-occurrence. In addition, we investigated species present-time partitioning by measuring the degree of overlap in their activity time. Both species were strictly diurnal and their activity time highly overlapped (i. e., the species are not present-time partitioning). The distribution of the two species varied across the landscape, and they seemed to occupy opposite portions of the study area, but co-occurrence models and species interaction factors suggested that the tinamous have independent occupancy and detection. In addition, co-occurrence models that accounted for habitat performed better than models without habitat covariates. The observed co-occurrence pattern is more likely related to habitat preferences, wherein species segregated by elevation. These results provide evidence that habitat characteristics can play a bigger role than interspecific interactions in regulating co-existence of some species. Therefore, exploring habitat preferences while analyzing co-occurrence patterns is essential, {{in addition to being a}} feasible approach to achieve more accurate estimation of parameters reflecting species interactions. Occupancy models can be a valuable tool in such modeling...|$|E
