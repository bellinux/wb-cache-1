Several modifications were introduced which led to outline an analytical procedure. The nitrates are extracted by percolation, with a solution of H 2 SO 4 0, 01 N which is efficient in obtaining clear filtrates without clay {{and it is a}} saving time procedure. The ratio employed to remove soil nitrates is one weight of soil for three volumes of the extractor. The H 2 SO 4 solution was the best extractor found because it dissolves less organic matter from the soil than other methods. Also, with the method described, the operation of removing chlorides is easy and it is possible to use a <b>blank</b> <b>determination.</b> Losses of nitrates are significant when chlorides are present in concentration as high as 11 e. &# 956;g (3. 9 p. p. m.). The efficient removal of chlorides by using silver sulfate, can be performed only in acid extracts, if losses of nitrates are to be avoided. The solution free from chlorides must be neutralized with NaOH 1 N because acid reaction causes loss in nitrates which are liberated as HNO 3 (gas). The residual organic matter is destructed with hydrogen peroxide after drying the solution. The hydrogen peroxide always has nitrates and the quantity of them must be determined. The residual salts from the above treatments are attacked with phenoldisulfonic acid and this solution dilutes to a convenient volume and neutralized with ammonium hidroxide (1 + 1). The color intensity developed in this reaction is read in an AC model Fisher Electrophotometer with B- 425 filter calibrated for nitrates.

30|$|Proper quality {{assurance}} {{procedures and precautions}} were taken to ensure {{the reliability of the}} results. The samples were carefully handled to avoid any external influences that could interfere with the integrity of the sample and hence contaminate it. All glassware’s were rigorously washed with detergent, rinsed with distilled water, thoroughly rinsed with analytical grade acetone and dried overnight in an oven at 150  °C. The glassware’s were then removed from the oven and allowed to cool down and stored in dust-free cabinets. Deionized water was used throughout the study. For the spectrophotometric analysis, reagent <b>blank</b> <b>determinations</b> were used to correct the instrument readings. For validation of the analytical procedure, repeated analysis of the samples against internationally certified/standard reference material (SRM- 1570) of National Institute of Standard and Technology were used. The quality of organophosphorus pesticide residues was assured through the analysis of solvent blanks, procedural matrix blanks and duplicate samples. All reagents used during the analysis were exposed to same extraction procedures and subsequently run to check for interfering substances. In the blank for each extraction procedure, no pesticide was detected. A sample of each series was analysed in duplicates. All extracts were kept frozen until quantification was done. Recalibration curves were run with each batch of samples to check that the correlation coefficient was kept around r 2  =  0.99. A fortification level of 0.01  mg/kg for soil and 0.01  µg/L for water were chosen before the analysis to evaluate the recovery of the compounds in both soil and water samples. The efficiency of the analytical methods (the extraction and clean-up methods) was determined by recoveries of an internal standard. The recoveries of internal standards ranged between 70 and 94  % for all the organophosphorus pesticide analysed. These recovery values shows that the method used is reproducible.|$|R
40|$|Background. Soil {{contamination}} {{from heavy}} metals and {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) released during informal e-waste processing and disposal poses human and ecological health risks in Nigeria. Objectives. This study assesses the levels of heavy metals and PAHs in soils of e-waste dumpsites in Lagos and Ibadan, Nigeria. Methods. Composite soil samples were collected at depths of 0 – 15 cm, 15 – 30 cm and 30 – 45 cm from major e-waste dumpsites in Lagos and Ibadan and analyzed for lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn), chromium (Cr) and PAHs to evaluate the potential contaminant contribution from e-waste activities. Control samples were collected at the Botanical Garden, University of Ibadan. Samples were analyzed for heavy metals after acid digestion using atomic absorption spectrophotometry, while PAHs were extracted using cold solvent extraction and quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. <b>Blank</b> <b>determination</b> and recovery {{studies were carried out}} for each metal. Contamination and ecological risks were assessed using soil contamination indices such as contamination factor, geo-accumulation and pollution load indices, and potential ecological risk index to categorize contaminant concentrations and associated impacts. Soil physico-chemical characteristics such as pH and total organic matter were also determined. Results. Metals concentrations in the dumpsite soils ranged from 114 – 2, 840 mg/kg and not detectable - 6. 50 mg/kg for Pb and Cd, and 42. 8 – 5, 390 mg/kg, 27. 5 – 3, 420 mg/kg, 11. 0 – 128 mg/kg and 94. 0 – 325 mg/kg for Cu, Zn, Ni and Cr, respectively. Serious metals accumulation was observed at every e-waste dumpsite, as shown by the pollution load index. The potential ecological risk values were between 584 and 10, 402 at all of the dumpsites, signifying very high ecological risk. The total PAHs ranged from 1, 756 – 2, 224 μg/kg at the 0 – 15 cm level, 1, 664 – 2, 152 μg/kg at 15 – 30 cm and 278 μg/kg in the top- and sub-soil of the control site. Discussion. The total PAHs in the soil of e-waste dumpsites was significantly higher than in the control soil. Conclusions. The results {{of this study indicate that}} indiscriminate dumping and open burning of e-waste are potential sources of PAH and toxic metal emissions, which can pose serious human health and ecological risks.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that direct {{measurement}} of the iron content in seawater by means of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) is hardly possible and for open ocean water samples, typically, it requires a separation from the matrix associated to significant concentration factors. Furthermore, in the low ng kg- 1 range a correct assessment of the analytical procedural blank is of crucial importance. Not only must this blank be low, but also realistic (i. e. obtained from the complete analytical sequence applied to real seawater) and reproducible. This is particularly difficult considering the ubiquity of iron and the complexity of the seawater matrix and, despite years of experiments and publications, this remains a fundamental analytical challenge and a great source of complexity for the realisation of reliable profiles of dissolved iron data. This paper re-visits the isotope dilution, ID, ICPMS procedure described by Wu and Boyle [], based on a multiple steps protocol, including a co-precipitation with magnesium hydroxide after ammonia loading and consecutive dissolution with hydrochloric acid, and compares two ways of evaluating realistic procedural blanks. The analytical protocol is optimised to achieve reproducible separation/pre-concentration of ~ 100 % Fe under stable pH conditions. Typically, at ~ 30 ng Fe kg- 1 level a concentration factor of up to 15 can be achieved leading to samples containing residual salinity ~ 0. 06 %. The first approach proposed for procedural <b>blank</b> <b>determination</b> applies mostly to Fe mass fractions > 500 ng kg- 1 and results from the comparison of two IDMS-based Fe content values of identical sample where the first is produced by Mg(OH) 2 co-precipitation and the second – by dilution. For the second approach, adapted to lower Fe content samples (down to 3 ng Fe kg- 1), the absolute procedural blank is the intercept of a linear regression between sample masses and corresponding absolute Fe contents for a given set of sample replicates. The estimated procedural blanks for both approaches were 16 +/- 12 ng kg- 1 and 6 +/- 2 ng kg- 1 respectively. We found that manipulations (i. e. sample handling) are by far the largest source of contamination as they contribute for ~ 75 % of the total. The 2 % nitric acid used to dissolve the precipitate and the instrumental background come after with respectively ~ 3 - 10 % and ~ 5 - 9 % contributions. The measurement process was validated through the use of reference materials, a systematic assessment of factors influencing the result, by calculating the combined measurement uncertainty and from the results obtained on a test material of a recent inter-laboratory comparison.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{importance}} of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) compounds for the vertical transport of organic material in marine systems samples from the water column {{as well as from}} porewaters of marine sediments were analyzed with respect to their DOC concentrations. The locations selected were in different oceanographic regions of the Atlantic Ocean and have been sampled at different seasons. Analysis of DOC was done by means of catalytic high-temperature combustion (HTC), special emphasis was put on conditioning of the reactor and <b>blank</b> <b>determination.</b> Depending on region and season, DOC concentrations in the water column amounted 50 - 80 #mu#mol/l in the mixed layer and decreased rapidly within the seasonal thermocline. Below the seasonal thermocline only small gradients were observed. DOC concentrations in deep waters averaged 36 - 43 #mu#mol/l. Vertical diffusive fluxes of DOC were estimated form the DOC concentrations using exchange coefficients calculated from density data. Calculated diffusive fluxes of DOC from the surface layers to below the seasonal thermocline were in the range of 50 - 430 #mu#mol/m" 2 /d and decreased to values < 10 - 60 #mu#mol/m" 2 /d at greater depths. To evaluate the DOC fraction of the total transport of organic material the data are compared to POC fluxes from sediment trap studies at selected locations. The relative importance of the DOC transport from the mixed layer ranged from 3 to 50 % (mean 8 %) of the POC export, it depends mainly on the POC flux. At greater depths the contribution from DOC to the vertical transport of organic matter is negligible. DOC concentrations of the porewaters studied amounted 0. 3 to about 5 mmol/l and were thus at least an order of magnitude higher than water column concentrations. The flux of DOC out of the sediment evolving from these gradients was calculated to be 0. 06 - 0. 66 mmol/m" 2 /d based on a molecular weight range of sedimentary DOC of 3 - 100 kDa, which is 4 - 60 % (mean 22 %) of the total benthic remineralization of organic material. A global estimate reveals an input of 2. 2 x 10 " 1 " 4 gC/yr as DOC from the sediments, corresponding approximately to the amount of organic carbon buried in the sediments. The DOC export from the mixed layer down below the seasonal thermocline due to diffusive processes is 1. 9 x 10 " 1 " 4 gC/yr for the global ocean. This is about 2 % of the global new production given in the literature. Thus, the vertical transport of organic carbon in the dissolved form is generally of minor importance, though it may not be neglected under certain conditions/circumstances. (orig.)

In subsequent iterations the blank shape is continuously improved in accordance with the developed optimisation method.

These esters are good competitive inhibitors of alpha-chymotrypsin. N-acetyl-(-) alpha-methyl-beta-(2 -naphthyl) -alanine is a slowly hydrolyzed substrate of this enzyme.

A fairly good agreement was obtained between CTC values assayed by the microbiologic method and those by the proposed fluorometric method. Moreover, this method can be employed for field assay of CTC concentration in ice (Figs. 1, 2, and Tables 1, 3). A precise determination by using Beckman spectrophotometer : To a 10 cc aliquot of sample and each of standard solution series (1 - 5 mcg per cc) and 1 cc of a 1 % potassium alum (KA 1 (SO_ 4) _ 2 ? 12 H_ 2 O) solution in M/ 2 acetate buffer of pH 4. 6. Allow it to stand for 20 to 60 minutes at room temperature. Measure the fluorescence at a wave length of 500 mu of the sample when irradiated by an excitation light of 365 mu or 436 mu. Measure likewise the fluorescence {{of a series of}} standard solutions added with the alum reagent. Subtract the blank value from each measured intensity of fluorescence, and prepare a standard curve by plotting the intensity against the concentration of CTC. By employing this standard curve find the CTC concentration of the sample solution corresponding to its intensity of fluorescence which is corrected for the <b>blank</b> value. Approximate <b>determination</b> : The following methods are developed for the field work.

After allowing it to stand for 5 to 10 minutes, observe the fluorescence {{from the top of the}} tubes irradiated with the black ray lamp from the side. Estimate CTC concentration of the ice sample by comparing the fluorescence of the sample with those of the standard series treated in the same way as the sample. (2) Portable nephelo-colorimeter method : Add a 1 cc aliquot of the alum reagent to both a 10 cc aliquot of supernatant of a thawed sample and a standard solution (4 or 2 mcg/cc depending on CTC content of sample). After allowing them to stand for 10 minutes, place the sample in one of the comparison tube (A) and the standard in the other tube (B), set the bottom of the inner tube for the tube (B) at a depth of 30 mm and by evenly irradiating with the long wave ultra-violet lamp and matching the intensity for tube (A) against that for tube (B), find the reading, h, for tube (A) where the intensity of the sample is identical with that of the standard. The content of CTC (mcg/cc) can be calculated by a formula, S× 30 /h, where S is the CTC concentration of the standard solution employed. サリチル酸およびサリチル酸アミドのような螢光性有機物はアルカリ,アルカリ土類および稀土類などの金属と酷塩をつくつて,発螢光性が強くなる. 一方CTCはMgCl_ 2 およびCaCl_ 2 の溶液中で黄色の螢光を発し,またCa, Mgのような金属とキレート化合物をつくることが知られている. 因つて著者はCTCのある種の金属キレート化合物は強い螢光を発するのではないかと想像し,分光光度計を用いてまず種々の金属イオンによる螢光度の差異をみたところ,アルミニウムイオンの存在によつてCTCの螢光が最も強くなることを見出したので,定量法の決定に必要な種々の条件を検討し一新定量法を決定することができた...|$|R
