5000|$|In the Indian {{mathematical}} tradition, the sine ( [...] or jya) of {{an angle}} {{is not a}} ratio of numbers. It is {{the length of a}} certain line segment, a certain half-chord. The radius of the base circle is basic parameter for the construction of such tables. Historically, several tables have been constructed using different values for this parameter. Āryabhaṭa has chosen the number 3438 as the value of radius of the base circle for the computation of his sine table. The rationale of the choice of this parameter is the idea of measuring the circumference of a circle in angle measures. In astronomical computations distances are measured in degrees, minutes, seconds, etc. In this measure, the circumference of a circle is 360° = (60 × 360) minutes = 21600 minutes. The radius of the circle, the measure of whose circumference is 21600 minutes, is21600 / 2π minutes. Computing this using the value π = 3.1416 known to Aryabhata one gets the radius of the circle as 3438 minutes approximately. Āryabhaṭa's sine table is based on this value for the radius of the base circle. It has not yet been established who is the first ever to use this value for the <b>base</b> <b>radius.</b> But Aryabhatiya is the earliest surviving text containing a reference to this basic constant.|$|E

When increasing the viscosity contribution, the exponent n is found to increase despite the increase of the spreading time.

40|$|The {{spreading}} of {{a circular}} liquid drop on a solid substrate {{can be described}} by the time evolution of its <b>base</b> <b>radius</b> R(t). In complete wetting the quasistationary regime (far away from initial and final transients) typically obeys the so-called Tanner law, with R t^alpha_T, alpha_T= 1 / 10.
