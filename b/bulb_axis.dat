40|$|Dopaminergic loss {{is known}} {{to be one of the}} major {{hallmarks}} of Parkinson disease (PD). In addition to its function as a neurotransmitter, dopamine plays significant roles in developmental and adult neurogenesis. Both dopaminergic deafferentation and stimulation modulate proliferation in the subventricular zone (SVZ) /olfactory bulb system as well as in the hippocampus. Here, we study the impact of 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) lesions to the medial forebrain bundle on proliferation and neuronal differentiation of newly generated cells in the SVZ/olfactory <b>bulb</b> <b>axis</b> in adult rats. Proliferation in the SVZ decreased significantly after dopaminergic deafferentation. However, the number of neural progenitor cells expressing the proneuronal cell fate determinant Pax- 6 increased in the SVZ. Survival and quantitative cell fate analysis of newly generated cells revealed that 6 -OHDA lesions induced opposite effects in the two different regions of neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb: a transient decrease in the granule cell layer contrasts to a sustained increase of newly generated neurons in the glomerular layer. These data point towards a shift in the ratio of newly generated interneurons in the olfactory bulb layers. Dopaminergic neurogenesis in the glomerular layer tripled after lesioning and consistent with this finding, the total number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) -positive cells increased. Thus, loss of dopaminergic input to the SVZ led to a distinct cell fate decision towards stimulation of dopaminergic neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb glomerular layer. This study supports the accumulating evidence that neurotransmitters play a crucial role in determining survival and differentiation of newly generated neurons...|$|E
40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a slowly {{progressing}} neurodegenerative disorder {{caused by}} loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), leading to severe impairment in motor and non-motor functions. Endogenous subventricular zone (SVZ) neural stem cells constantly {{give birth to}} new cells which might serve as a possible source for regeneration in the adult brain. However, neurodegeneration is accompanied by neuroinflammation and dopamine depletion, potentially compromising regeneration. We therefore employed in vivo imaging methods to study striatal deafferentation ([123 I]Ioflupane SPECT, DaTscanTM) and neuroinflammation in SN and striatum ([18 F]DPA- 714 PET) in the intranigral 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) PD mouse model. Additionally, we transduced cells in the SVZ with a lentivirus encoding firefly luciferase and followed migration of progenitor cells in the SVZ – olfactory <b>bulb</b> (OB) <b>axis</b> via bioluminescence imaging (BLI) under disease and control conditions. We found that activation of microglia in the SN is an acute process coming along with the degeneration of dopaminergic cell bodies in the SN. Dopaminergic deafferentation of the striatum does not influence the generation of Dcx+ neuroblasts in the SVZ, but generates chronic astrogliosis in the nigrostriatal system...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose: The single major {{disadvantage}} of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) patch reconstruction with greater saphenous vein (GSV) is central patch rupture, {{which has a}} reported incidence of 0. 5 % to 4 %. This is a prospective evaluation of the selective use of GSV for a CEA patch based on previously established vein diameter criteria. Methods: Between 1988 and mid- 1995, 534 of 671 CEAs (80 %) were reconstructed with GSVs that had a distended diameter ≥ 3. 5 mm. Thigh veins were used in all 252 women who underwent CEA. Of the 282 men who underwent CEA, 265 GSVs (94 %) were harvested from below the knee and 17 from the thigh. During this period four thigh and 13 below-knee veins (3. 2 %) were rejected because the diameter was 12 mm (mean, 15. 3 mm). Eight of these CEAs were reconstructed with thigh veins. Conclusions: Use of GSVs with a distended diameter ≥ 3. 5 mm for CEA patch reconstruction significantly reduces the probability of central patch rupture; however, a few CEAs reconstructed with veins > 3. 5 mm in diameter and large carotid bulbs have predicted patch rupture pressures < 400 mm Hg. Because at times some veins will have rupture pressures lower than desirable, CEA reconstruction should be tailored to keep the carotid <b>bulb</b> major <b>axis</b> diameter < 13 mm.

40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disorder {{characterized by}} motor symptoms resulting from the degeneration of dopaminergic perikarya in the substantia nigra (SN) leading to a striatal dopamine (DA) deficiency. The disruption of DA responses in the mesocorticolimbic system {{as well as in}} the subventricular zone (SVZ) olfactory <b>bulb</b> (OB) <b>axis</b> has also been shown to lead to two major non-motor symptoms, namely memory deficits and hyposmia, which is an important early diagnostic marker of the disease. Adult human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been shown to induce neuroprotective effects in models for PD. They can be easily derived, are anti-inflammatory and secrete growth factors important for neuronal differentiation. Consequently, they are ideal candidates for the induction of neurogenesis and repair in neurodegenerative disorders. There is evidence that the effects mentioned above depend on the phenotype of the grafted MSC. Because these effects have not yet been sufficiently evaluated on a time-dependent scale, they were subdivided into acute, intermediate and long-term effects. In the present study, we therefore compared the effects of monolayer-cultured (aMSC) and spheroid (sMSC) MSC following transplantation into the SN of 6 -OHDA lesioned rats after three days, three weeks and six months. The transplanted cells were analyzed for their secretion and expression patterns and for their resulting effects on the local microenvironment, including neuroprotection of dopaminergic neurons. Accordingly, the resulting motor symptoms and memory function were measured in the intermediate and long-term experiments. We also examined neurogenesis in both neurogenic zones, the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and the SVZ-OB-axis. Three days after transplantation, subventricular neurogenesis was significantly increased in both groups of MSC-transplanted animals. Grafted cells expressed brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Three weeks after transplantation, aMSC significantly increased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and BDNF as well as the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels in the SN and improved motor functions compared to untreated and sMSC treated animals. In contrast, sMSC grafting induced increased local microgliosis, decreased TH levels in the SN and reduced the numbers of newly generated cells in the DG without affecting hippocampal learning and memory function. After six months, dopamine levels were maintained by the graft of both MSC phenotypes. Hippocampal and subventricular neurogenesis also were significantly improved by MSC transplantation. To summarize the result of these three studies, the MSC graft has protective effects on the dopaminergic system and modulatory effects on neurogenesis in the hippocampus and SVZ-OB-axis. Further investigation on MSC therapy appears to be promising, as it may lead to causal disease-modifying therapeutic strategies with respect to motor as well as non-motor symptoms...|$|R
