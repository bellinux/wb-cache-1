60|$|Mr. Crewe leaned <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{and thrust}} {{his hands in}} his pockets and smiled. He was in one of his {{delightful}} moods.|$|E
60|$|After this admonition, there {{remained}} {{nothing to}} be said until Sancho's appetite was satisfied, when he drew a little <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and announced his readiness to proceed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that's what I thought, and--What are {{you looking}} at?" [...] she drew herself <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and {{followed}} {{the direction of his}} eye with a woman's instinctive apprehension of disarray.|$|E
60|$|So saying, {{he pushed}} <b>back</b> his chair <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and--regis ad exemplar--after {{the pattern of}} the Laird, all the company arose.|$|R
60|$|Somebody else {{got hold}} of Charnock. He was dragged <b>back,</b> hustled away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and towards <b>the</b> door. Then the bar was torn from his hands and a man pushed {{him out in the}} snow.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the same}} way at breakfast, the judge, as he looked over the morning paper, would {{sometimes}} leap to his feet with a perfect howl of suffering, and cry: [...] "Everlasting Moses! the Liberals have carried East Elgin." [...] Or else he would lean <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> breakfast <b>table</b> with <b>the</b> most good-humoured laugh you ever heard and say: [...] "Ha! ha! the Conservatives have carried South Norfolk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I c'n {{stand it}} as long as she can," [...] he said to himself, in the hearing of the children, as he pushed <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and went back to work.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Banks, who {{had been}} making noble efforts, could contain herself no longer. She put down the {{harmless}} beverage which had just been handed to her, and pushed her chair <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
60|$|Grief {{passed over}} his stack of takings, and Deacon, with {{trembling}} fingers, verified the count. He half shoved his chair <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and emptied his glass. He looked about him at unsympathetic faces.|$|E
50|$|Note: No animal may {{be shown}} in a higher or lower age {{classification}} than its true age. Juniors must be lopped, but {{do not have to}} show curl in the coat although preference will be given to a curly coated animal.Canadian Plush Lops should be judged without handling, except for preliminary examination and coat evaluation. General type is best viewed by stepping <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> judging <b>table</b> and allowing <b>the</b> rabbit to pose and move naturally. A Canadian Plush Lop should not be pushed down or flattened out while judging. The animal should be friendly and bold in attitude, not shy or aggressive. They should have the look of an athletic, active individual.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy {{took another}} drink {{and tried to}} brace up. His luck, like his roll of bills, was {{obviously}} gone, {{but when he was}} winning the others had not stopped, and he did not want them, so to speak, to let him off. When he lost he could pay. But this was not important, and he must concentrate on his cards. The cards got worse and as a rule the ace he thought one antagonist had was played by another. At length Stannard pushed <b>back</b> his chair <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|R
60|$|No. By {{a strange}} contradiction it was Horace himself who now {{interfered}} to prevent Mercy <b>from</b> leaving <b>the</b> room. In {{the heat of}} his indignation he lost all sense of his own dignity; he descended {{to the level of}} a woman whose intellect he believed to be deranged. To the surprise of every one present, he stepped <b>back</b> and took <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> a jewel-case which he had placed there when he came into the room. It was <b>the</b> wedding present <b>from</b> his mother which he had brought to his betrothed wife. His outraged self-esteem seized the opportunity of vindicating Mercy by a public bestowal of the gift.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold on there, Davis," [...] {{he called}} to the faro-dealer, who had shoved his chair <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> [...] "I'm going you one flutter to see whether you-all drink with me or we-all drink with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{do not ask}} why I came north?" [...] she asked. [...] "Surely you know." [...] They {{had moved}} <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and David Payne had {{returned}} to his axe- handle. [...] "Did you get my letter?" ...|$|E
60|$|A peal of merry {{laughter}} answered her, and {{the knives}} and forks {{fell to the}} plates with a clatter. One of the chairs pushed <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and this was so astonishing and mysterious that Dorothy was almost tempted to run away in fright.|$|E
60|$|She was {{not exactly}} a bad mother, and she {{was not exactly}} a good mother. If she had been really a good mother she would have let him do {{whatever}} he wanted, and never made any trouble, and if she had been a bad mother she would not have let him do anything; and then he could have done it without her letting him. In some ways she was good enough; she would let him take out things to the boys in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> yard <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and she put apple-butter or molasses on when it was hot biscuit that he took out. Once she let him have a birthday party, and had cake and candy-pulling and lemonade, and nobody but boys, because he said that boys hated girls; even his own sisters did not come. Sometimes she would give him money for ice-cream, and if she could have got over being particular about his going in swimming before he could swim, and pistols and powder and such things, she would have done very well.|$|R
60|$|Hamel {{raised his}} glass and bowed to his host and hostess. He was not wholly at his ease. It {{seemed to him that}} he was being watched with a queer {{persistence}} by both of them. Mrs. Fentolin continued to talk and laugh with a gaiety which was too obviously forced. Mr. Fentolin posed for a while as the benevolent listener. He mildly applauded his sister-in-law's stories, and encouraged Hamel in the recital of some of his reminiscences. Suddenly the door was opened. Miss Price appeared. She walked smoothly across the room and stood by Mr. Fentolin's side. Stooping down, she whispered in his ear. He pushed his chair <b>back</b> a little <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> His face was dark with anger.|$|R
40|$|Open {{transcranial}} {{approaches to}} the anterior skull base remain an integral component of current skull base practice. Evolution {{of these and other}} techniques has resulted in revisions of standard, tried-and-true methods in attempts to improve patient outcomes and cosmesis, while still providing the best combination of surgical exposure and ergonomics. To describe a modified approach for midline tumors of the anterior skull base. We describe the anatomy and techniques of a modified extended bifrontal craniotomy for anterior skull base tumors. Case examples and a postoperative 3 -dimensional computed tomographic reconstruction of the craniotomy are provided. The technique has been employed with success in 3 tuberculum sellae meningiomas where the anterior limit of the tumor is several centimeters <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>table</b> of <b>the</b> frontal bone. <b>The</b> mean distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tumor to inner table was 2. 8 cm (range 1. 3 - 3. 8 cm). Mean tumor dimensions were 3. 0 cm (transverse), 3. 5 cm (anterior-posterior), and 2. 2 cm (craniocaudal). Average operative time was 557 min. No cases had new T 2 /fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging signal of the inferior frontal lobe to indicate retraction injury. The tailored extended bifrontal craniotomy for anterior skull base tumors provides adequate access to the anterior cranial fossa and has replaced our standard extended bifrontal approach. Keeping the osteotomy cut lines outside of the orbit reduces orbital swelling and mechanical disruption of conjugate eye movements in the early postoperative period, while allowing for minimal frontal lobe retraction and providing sufficient surgical exposure along the anterior skull base...|$|R
60|$|I {{sat with}} it in my hand {{for a moment or}} so before I opened it, hesitating as one hesitates before a door that may reveal a {{dramatic}} situation. Then I pushed my chair a little <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and ripped the envelope.|$|E
60|$|The Councills and the Burns {{families}} took dinner together. Mrs. Burns, fretful and worn, cuffed {{the children}} <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> while bringing out her biscuit and roast chicken. Some sat stolidly silent, but big-voiced Councill joked in his heavy way with everyone within earshot.|$|E
60|$|He {{was sitting}} <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> now, {{with one arm}} {{over the back of}} his green chair and the other resting on the little table. He was smiling under his heavy mustache, and his head was a little on one side as he looked at her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{blame the}} police for being at fault. I don't see how {{it could have been}} otherwise. There was just one little clue that they might have {{followed}} up, but it was a small one. I mean that small, circular mirror which was found in my brother's pocket. It isn't a very common thing for a young man to carry about with him, is it? But a gambler might have told you what such a mirror may mean to a card-sharper. If you sit <b>back</b> a little <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and lay <b>the</b> mirror, face upwards, upon your lap, you can see, as you deal, every card that you give to your adversary. It is not hard to say whether you see a man or raise him when you know his cards as well as your own. It was {{as much a part of}} a sharper's outfit as the elastic clip upon Sparrow MacCoy's arm. Taking that, in connection with the recent frauds at the hotels, the police might have got hold of one end of the string.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the party}} concludes Councilor Knap {{decides to go}} home. He finds the galoshes, puts them on and is {{sent back to the}} reign of King Hans. He is not {{immediately}} aware of what happened, but does notice that the unpaved streets are full with filth and mud. He notices a procession for the Bishop of Seeland and assumes it's for <b>the</b> bishop <b>from</b> his time period. As he wants to cross the bridge to Palace Square he notices it's gone and ask two men in a boat where the bridge is and that he wants to go to Christian's Harbour on Little Market Street. The men have no idea what he is talking about and Knap has trouble understanding their speech, which he assumes is an accent that belongs to people of Bornholm. As a result, he continues his walk, frustrated that not only the bridge is gone and all the lights are out, but that there are also no cabs to take. He decides to walk back to the East Street, but to his amazement the East Gate is now a meadow. Knap assumes he must be ill and desperately wants to go home, but he can't recognize any of the buildings. As he enters a tavern he tries to find his local paper, but they don't have it. When he notices a woodcut of a meteor over Cologne he wonders where the owners [...] "got this rare old print?". As he discusses the content he gets into a conversation in Latin with a man who holds a bachelor in theology. They discuss many topics and Knap keeps misinterpreting these medieval topics for events that happened in his own lifetime. For instance, he confuses a remark about the Black Plague with a reference to a cholera epidemic in the 19th century. As the evening continues they all begin to drink more and Knap is repulsed by the vulgar behaviour of the people. He decides to sneak out, but the others pull him <b>back</b> <b>from</b> under <b>the</b> <b>table</b> by his feet, thereby pulling off the galoshes and breaking the spell. Waking up in his own age Knapp assumes it was all a dream and now fancies his own time period as the best.|$|R
6000|$|... “It’s {{all over}} and done with,” was Doña Rita’s answer, in a louder tone than I had ever heard her use before. It thrilled me while she continued: “I mean, this thinking.” She was <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{remoteness}} of her meditation, very much so indeed. She rose and moved away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> inviting by a sign the other to follow her; which he did at once, yet slowly and as it were warily.|$|R
60|$|They parted at the door, and Julian {{returned}} to his seat, uneasy and perplexed. Around the Council table voices were raised in anger. Fenn, who was sitting moodily with folded arms, his chair drawn a little <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> scowled {{at him as he}} took his place. Furley, who had been whispering to the Bishop, turned towards Julian.|$|E
6000|$|Griffith gazed {{with wonder}} at the fair {{signature}} of the unfortunate Louis, which graced {{the bottom of the}} parchment; but when his eye obeyed the signal of the stranger, and rested on the body of the instrument, he started <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and fixing his animated eyes on the pilot, he cried, while a glow of fiery courage flitted across his countenance: ...|$|E
60|$|Chris betrayed {{disturbance}} at {{the sound}} of her voice, and thereafter silence was maintained. Only could be heard the steady scratching of the pencil. Suddenly, {{as though it had been}} stung, he jerked his hand away. With a sigh and a yawn he stepped <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> then glanced with the curiosity of a newly awakened man at their faces.|$|E

6000|$|... "I can't follow you," [...] she said. [...] "You {{must tell}} it, or {{read it to}} me."

60|$|These {{sketches}} had a most disagreeable {{effect on}} Donatello's peculiar temperament. He gave a shudder; his face assumed {{a look of}} trouble, fear, and disgust; he snatched up one sketch after another, as if about to tear it in pieces.
