500|$|More than a {{thousand}} young actresses were considered for the part of Max. Cameron started reviewing audition tapes when the field had been narrowed down to twenty or thirty applicants. He was initially not impressed with Alba's audition tape, saying [...] "she had her head down, she was reading out of the script... she didn't present herself all that well. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the way she read the script that copped an attitude that I liked." [...] Cameron continually reviewed the audition tapes but {{kept coming back to}} Alba's, eventually deciding that he needed to meet her. Alba was hired for the role before the script was written. Eglee said: [...] "We had the benefit of being able to write a script kind of backwards, we were writing for this actress, with her cadences and her rhythms and her sensibilities and her attitude and her slang." [...] To train for the role, Alba spent a year doing martial arts and gymnastics and riding motorcycles.|$|E
500|$|Actress Kristen Bell {{was cast}} {{as the voice of}} Anna on March 5, 2012. Lee {{admitted}} that Bell's casting selection was influenced after the filmmakers listened to a series of vocal tracks Bell had recorded when she was young, where the actress performed several songs from The Little Mermaid, including [...] "Part of Your World". Bell completed her recording sessions while she was pregnant, and subsequently re-recorded some of her character's lines after her pregnancy, as her voice had deepened. Bell was called in to re-record dialogue for the film [...] "probably 20 times," [...] which is normal for lead roles in Disney animated films whose scripts are still evolving. As for her approach to the role of Anna, Bell enthused that she had [...] "dreamed of being in a Disney animated film" [...] since she was four years old, saying, [...] "I always loved Disney animation, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the females that was unattainable to me. Their posture was too good and they were too well-spoken, and I feel like I really made this girl much more relatable and weirder and scrappier and more excitable and awkward. I'm really proud of that." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Kunis {{replaced}} Lacey Chabert in {{the role}} of Meg Griffin on the animated sitcom Family Guy, created by Seth MacFarlane for Fox. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, in part due to her performance on That '70s Show. When Kunis auditioned for the role, she was called back by MacFarlane, who instructed her to speak slower. He then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her. MacFarlane added: [...] "What Mila Kunis brought to it was in a lot of ways, I thought, almost more right for the character. I say that Lacey did a phenomenal job, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Milaâ€“ something very natural about Mila. She was 15 when she started, so you were listening to a 15-year-old. Oftentimes with animation they'll have adult actors doing the voices of teenagers and they always sound like Saturday morning voices. They sound oftentimes very forced. She had a very natural quality to Meg that really made what we did with that character kind of really work." [...] Kunis was nominated for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production in 2007. She also voiced Meg in the Family Guy Video Game!. Kunis described her character as [...] "the scapegoat." ...|$|E

60|$|Kotick, Matkah's baby, {{was born}} {{in the middle of that}} confusion, and he was all head and shoulders, with pale, watery blue eyes, as tiny seals must be, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> his coat that made his mother look at him very closely.|$|E
60|$|I {{was burning}} to get away, {{for it was}} already {{doubtful}} if I should be in time for dinner. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the old man's honest air of bitterness that seemed to open to me the possibilities of life larger and more tragic than my own.|$|E

60|$|Poor girl, she did {{not know}} what else to say; she was not of a nervous disposition, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> George's manner that alarmed her very much, and she glanced anxiously around to see if any one was within call, but the place was lonely as the grave.|$|E
60|$|With {{any other}} man I should have flown {{outright}} into a dreadful passion, scorned all further words, and thrust him ignominiously from my presence. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Bartleby that not only strangely disarmed me, but in a wonderful manner touched and disconcerted me. I began to reason with him.|$|E
60|$|Miltoun {{would not}} have obeyed that {{invitation}} from anyone else, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Lord Dennis which people did not resist; his power lay in a dry ironic suavity which could not but persuade people that impoliteness was altogether too new and raw a thing to be indulged in.|$|E

6000|$|... "I can't make out.

60|$|This was {{not what}} Miss Ponsonby had {{intended}} to say, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the young man that touched her exceedingly; even when fresh from a very civil and decorous combat with his father, and a ripping-up of all the ancient grievances of the married life of their two relations, rendering wider than ever the breach between the houses of Ponsonby and Fitzjocelyn.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ay, sir, he {{is strong}} enow, I wis; {{we have done}} our best for him,' responded Hob, while Hal stood shy and shamefaced; <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> his bearing that made Sir Lancelot observe, 'Ay, ay, he shows what he comes of more than his mother made me fear.
