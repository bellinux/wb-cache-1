5000|$|During {{the same}} era (late 1970s) PS Audio {{introduced}} its first power amplifier, the Model One, a solid state design producing 70 watts per channel into 8 Ohms and 140 watts per channel into 4 Ohms. The design {{was a classic}} AB amplifier design featuring the company's first full 19" [...] chassis design, large power supply, low feedback and minimalist design constraints. The Model One was later followed with the world's first Audiophile integrated amplifier introduced by an American High-End company, the Elite. Based on the Model One architecture, the Elite integrated the Linear Control Center into a Model One amplifier chassis. The Model One {{was replaced by the}} Model II, moving back to a smaller modular chassis approach at 8.5" [...] with faceplate. The Model II produced 40 watts per channel into 8 Ohms, 70 watts per channel into 4 Ohms and had a <b>Bridging</b> <b>switch</b> enabling the user to bridge the internal stereo amplifiers into one mono amplifier, producing 160 watts into 4 Ohms. The Model II was followed by the IIC, featuring the same circuitry placed into a standard 19" [...] rack mount chassis. The IIC introduced a new concept to the Audiophile marketplace, use of a separate external power supply for an amplifier. Users could choose from two models of external power supply, one as standard and an upgrade to a larger High Current version. The concept of an external power supply was first introduced on the PS Audio IV preamplifier and later applied to power amplifiers like the IIC. The concept became known as the High Current Power Supply or HCPS and was popular because improvements to the sound quality were gained by moving to a larger power supply, both in the application of the preamplifier as well as power amplifiers. The model IIC is factory rated at 55 watts into 8 ohms and 200 watts bridged mode (400 watts into 4 ohms bridged). The IIC Plus is rated at 70 watts into 8 ohms. Amplifier successors to the IIC included the 250 Delta monoblock and the 100 Delta amplifier.|$|E

Interpiconet scheduling focuses on when a <b>bridge</b> is <b>switched</b> among various piconets and how a bridge node communicates with the masters in different piconets. This paper proposes an interpiconet scheduling algorithm named, hold mode based dynamic traffic priority load adaptive scheduling. The <b>bridges</b> are adaptively <b>switched</b> between the piconets according to various traffic loads. The main goal is to maximize the utilization of the bridge by reducing the <b>bridge</b> <b>switch</b> wastes, utilize intelligent decision making algorithm, resolve conflict between the masters, and allow negotiation for bridge utilization in HDPLIS using bridge failure-bridge repair procedure. The Hold mode - dynamic traffic - priority based - load adaptive scheduling reduces the number of <b>bridge</b> <b>switch</b> wastes and hence increases the efficiency of the bridge which results in increased performance of the system...|$|R

40|$|A {{short term}} effort (3 -months) was {{undertaken}} {{to demonstrate the}} feasibility of a novel method to locally control the heat transfer rate and demonstrate the potential to achieve a turndown ratio of approximately 10 : 1. The technology had to be demonstrated {{to be at a}} TRL of 2 - 3, with a plan to advance it to a TRL 5 - 6. Here, we show that the concept recently developed in our laboratory, namely the pinned-contact, double droplet switch made by overfilling a hole drilled in a suitable substrate can be implemented with a low-melting temperature metal. When toggled near a second substrate, a liquid bridge can be reversibly connected or disconnected, on demand. We have shown experimentally that liquid-metal <b>bridge</b> <b>switches</b> can be made from gallium with a suitable choice of substrate materials, activation strategies, and control techniques. Individual as well as arrays of gallium <b>bridge</b> <b>switches</b> were shown to be feasible and can be robustly controlled. The very short response time of the bridge connection and disconnection (on the order of 1 millisecond) provides for utility {{in a wide range of}} applications. The liquid <b>bridge</b> <b>switches</b> may be controlled actively or passively. We have shown through computations and analysis that liquid <b>bridge</b> <b>switches</b> provide locally large turndown ratios (on the order of 103 : 1), so a relatively sparse packing of them would be needed to obtain the desired turndown ratio of 10 : 1. For the laboratory demonstrations, pressure activation was utilized. Simple designs for a passive control strategy are presented which are highly attractive for several reasons, including i) large turndown ratio, ii) no solid-moving parts, and iii) stable operation. Finally, we note that passive systems do not require any electronics for their control. This along with the relatively small molecular weight of candidate materials for the system, makes for a robust design outside of Earth?s magnetic field, where spacecraft are subject to significant radiation bombardment...|$|R

A good inter-piconet scheduling {{is necessary}} for the <b>bridge</b> devices to <b>switch</b> among the piconets they participated. This paper proposes an inter-piconet scheduling algorithm, Traffic-Aware Scatternet Scheduling (TASS), for bridges in bluetooth scatternets. According to the traffic information of all masters that the bridge is connected, TASS can adaptively <b>switch</b> the <b>bridge</b> to the masters with high traffic loads and increase the usage of the bridge. In addition, TASS can reduce the number of failed unsniffs and the overhead of the <b>bridge</b> <b>switch</b> wastes to further increase the overall system performance.

The DC charging current into the capacitors decreases during the loading with the same factor with which the voltage increases. In this way the current taken from the threephase mains is constant.
