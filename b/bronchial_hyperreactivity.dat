40|$|It {{is known}} {{that a variety of}} stimuli such as capsaicin, bradykinin, hyperosmotic saline {{solution}} and cigarette smoke can activate sensitive respiratory neurons and a release of a variety of mediators such as tachykinins substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA). Tachykinins are responsible for nasal <b>hyperreactivity,</b> <b>bronchial</b> obstruction and chronic inflammation in the airways. Unlike a lot of information about its pharmacological effects, the mechanism of biosynthesis and release of tachykinins is little known. In the present study, tachykinin induction was investigated in nasal trigeminal neurons under exposure of nerve growth factor (NGF) and in sensory airway-specific vagal neurons in allergic airway inflammation. Due to the help of neuronal tracing technique in a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation, it was possible to show the effects of NGF and ovalbumin A (OVA) in the induction of tachykinins in sensory neurons. After NGF application, tachykinins were detected in glutamine-negative, neurofilament-positive and neurofilament-negative neurons. The results suggest that nasal-specific trigeminal neurons are composed of heterogeneous subpopulations. In further experiments was detected a tachykinin induction after OVA-sensitization in myelinated axons of airway-specific sensory neurons. Most likely there is a quite new neuronal subpopulation, which due to a stimulus such as an allergen, responds with synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides.

It was the aim of this study to assess the relation of bronchial hyperresponsiveness to potential markers of eosinophilic inflammation in peripheral blood. Eosinophil count, the concentration of serum eosinophilic cationic protein, the capacity of purified eosinophils to generate leukotriene C 4, and bronchial reactivity was studied in 24 non-atopic children born prematurely, 12 healthy controls, and 12 children with asthma aged 6 to 9 years.

40|$|AbstractIt is done {{a review}} of {{evaluation}} methods of the inflammation in upper airways and bronchi used for diagnosis, therapeutic approach and prognosis of pa-thologies like rhinosinusitis and asthma. It is also analysed methods that supply relevant information of inflammation in COPD. The chronic inflammation of the airways is associated to respiratory distress, obstruction in basal lung function tests and to <b>bronchial</b> and nasal <b>hyperreactivity.</b> Computerized tomography informs about lu-men dimensions, bronchial walls thickness and pulmonary density. These changes are associated to inflammation and to remodelling of the airways. Localized inflammation in respiratory tract can be detected by modifications of systemic inflammatory markers. The direct evaluation of inflammatory airways changes are based on immune, histological and chemical analysis of lung tissue obtained by biopsies and by fluids recoil in basal conditions or after stimulation. The eosinophils are increased in biopsies and in nasal and bronchoalveolar lavage in asthma and rhinitis and can change with therapy. Proteins and mRNA expression of cellular activation mediators are also observed. The induced sputum identifies eosinophilic inflammation that is inversely associated with lung function parameters. In each respiratory cycle the air is enriched in organic volatile compounds produced by cellular breathing. FENO is the bio marker more deeply studied in asthma and its increase is well documented in this disorder. In the exhaled air condensed, reactive oxygen species, membrane mediators, cytokines, and chemokines are identified.

Data were collected from the clinical cards of the children.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Relatively {{little is}} known about risk factors for the {{persistence}} of asthma and respiratory symptoms from childhood into adolescence, and few studies have included objective measurements to assess outcomes and exposure.  METHODS—From a large cross sectional study of all 4 th grade school children in Munich (mean age 10. 2 years), 234 children (5 %) with active asthma were identified. Of these, 155 (66 %) were reinvestigated with lung function measurements and bronchial provocation three years later (mean age 13. 5 years).  RESULTS—At follow up 35. 5 % still had active asthma. Risk factors for persisting asthma symptoms in adolescence were more severe asthma (OR 4. 94; CI 1. 65 to 14. 76; p = 0. 004) or allergic triggers (OR 3. 54; CI 1. 41 to 8. 92; p = 0. 007) in childhood. Dampness was associated with increased night time wheeze and shortness of breath but not with persisting asthma. Risk factors for <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> in adolescence were <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> in childhood (p= 0. 004), symptoms triggered by allergen exposure (OR 5. 47; CI 1. 91 to 25. 20; p = 0. 029), and damp housing conditions (OR 16. 14; CI 3. 53 to 73. 73; p< 0. 001). In a subgroup in whom house dust mite antigen levels in the bed were measured (70 % of the sample), higher mite antigen levels were associated with <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> (OR per quartile of mite antigen 2. 30; CI 1. 03 to 5. 12; p = 0. 042).

However, the effect of dampness on <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> remained significant when adjusting for mite allergen levels (OR 5. 77; CI 1. 17 to 28. 44; p = 0. 031).  CONCLUSION—Dampness at home is a significant risk factor for the persistence of <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> and respiratory symptoms in children with asthma.

We used multivariate logistic regression to investigate the risk factors for BHR, and analyze the interaction between hospitalization for bronchiolitis in infancy and low socioeconomic status. Results: Forty-six (10. 3 %) positive BHR cases were identified. In the multivariate logistic analysis, as independent predictors of BHR, adjusted odds ratio of bronchiolitis diagnosed before 2 years of age in low income families was 13. 7 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 4 to 135. 0), compared to reference group, controlling for age, gender, parental allergy history, skin prick test, and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure.

AET dose dependently protected the mast cell disruption induced by compound 48 / 80. These results suggest that AET not only has bronchodilating activity but also decreases <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> by decreasing the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the airway and inhibiting the release of histamine like mediators from the mast cell by stabilizing it...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} role of {{individual}} and occupational risk factors for asthma in furniture workers. METHODS: 296 workers were examined (258 men, 38 women) with a questionnaire of respiratory symptoms and diseases, baseline spirometry, bronchial provocative test with methacholine, and skin prick tests. Non-specific <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> was defined as when a provocative dose with a fall of 20 % in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (PD 20 FEV 1) was < 0. 8 mg and atopy {{in the presence of}} at least one positive response to skin prick tests. Workers were subdivided into spray painters (exposed to low concentrations of diisocyanates and solvents), woodworkers (exposed to wood dusts), and assemblers (control group). RESULTS: The prevalences of attacks of shortness of breath with wheezing and dyspnoea were higher in spray painters (13. 5 % and 11. 5 % respectively) than in woodworkers (7. 7 % and 6. 3 %) or in assemblers (1. 6 % and 1. 6 %); prevalences of chronic cough, asthma, and rhinitis were also slightly but not significantly higher in spray painters and in woodworkers than in assemblers. The difference in the prevalence of respiratory symptoms among the job titles was due to the atopic subjects, who showed a higher prevalence of chronic cough, wheeze, shortness of breath with wheeze, dyspnoea, and asthma in spray painters than in the other groups. The prevalence of non-specific <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> in subjects who performed bronchial provocative tests was 17. 7 %, with no significant difference among groups. Asthma symptoms were significantly associated with non-specific <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperreactivity.</b> Asthma-like symptoms plus non-specific <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> was found in 4 % of assemblers, 10 % of woodworkers, and 13. 3 % of spray painters (chi 2 = 2. 6, NS). Multiple logistic analysis taking into account individual (smoke, atopy, age) and occupational (job titles) risk factors confirmed that spray painters had higher prevalence of chronic cough than assemblers, and a trend in increasing the prevalence of shortness of breath with wheeze, dyspnoea, and asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Painters in the furniture industry, particularly atopic subjects, are at higher risk of asthma-like symptoms than other job titles. In these workers asthma-like symptoms are more sensitive than non-specific <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> in detecting a negative effect of the occupational exposure...|$|E
40|$|Because {{histamine}} receptor type I blockade attenuates allergic asthma, {{we asked}} whether complete neutralization of histamine by an arthropod-derived, high affinity histamine-binding protein (EV 131) would prevent allergic asthma. Intranasal administration of EV 131 given before Ag challenge in immunized mice prevented airway hyperreactivity by 70 %, and abrogated peribronchial inflammation, pulmonary eosinophilia, mucus hypersecretion, and IL- 4 and IL- 5 secretion. Saturation with histamine abrogated the inhibitory effect of EV 131 on <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperreactivity.</b> The inhibitory effect of EV 131 on <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> was {{comparable to that}} of glucocorticosteroids. These results demonstrate that histamine is a critical mediator of allergic asthma. Therefore, complete neutralization of histamine, rather than specific histamine receptor blockade, may {{have a profound effect on}} allergic asthma...|$|E
40|$|In {{article on}} based {{analysis}} of spirometric indicators was researched {{the peculiarities of}} nonspecific <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> depending on the atopic status of school-age children. To identify the degree of atopy anamnestic atopic status and skin allergic tests were used. Children with atopic asthma characterized by tendency to expressive bronchial lability mostly due to bronhodilation response to short-acting β 2 -agonists and expressive airway hyperresponsiveness to histamine. However the verification of atopic asthma phenotype in children with bronchial lability index and the index of bronchodilation was characterized by high specific with low sensitivity. So, use markers of nonspecific <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> to confirmation atopic asthma phenotype relative nonatopic makes sense only {{in combination with other}} clinical, laboratory and intsrumental indices that reflect the main characteristics of the disease...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{histamine}} H 1 and H 2 receptors in {{the lung}} is not clear. H 1 receptor blockade results in bronchodilatation and inhibition of histamine induced bronchoconstriction. H 2 receptor blockade in vitro prevents the normal negative feedback of histamine on further mediator release in antigen challenge. Bronchospasm in guinea pigs given antigen challenge {{is enhanced by}} previous administration of metiamide or burimamide but not of cimetidine. These findings suggest the possible deleterious effect of H 2 receptor antagonists in asthmatic subjects. The effects of H 2 receptor blockade with cimetidine on <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> to histamine were studied in 10 asthmatic volunteers by whole body plethysmography. Cimetidine 800 mg and placebo were administered orally on two separate days, eight hours and two hours before study. No significant difference in baseline levels of airways obstruction was seen with the two agents. Inhalational challenge with increasing concentrations of histamine revealed {{no significant difference in}} <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> to histamine between cimetidine and placebo treatment days. H 2 receptor blockade with cimetidine does not appear to affect ventilatory function or <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> to histamine in asthmatic subjects. It has been suggested that cimetidine may have H 1 as well as H 2 receptor blocking properties which prevent this effect...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Heightened <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> is {{frequently}} associated with airflow limitation, atopy, or cigarette smoking. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate healthy subjects with significantly low values of forced expiratory volume in one second/vital capacity % (FEV 1 /VC%) by measuring their airway response to exercise and methacholine challenge, compared with a control group with normal spirometric values. METHODS [...] Eighty four healthy subjects with significantly low flow rates (group A, FEV 1 /VC% < 2 SD% predicted) were evaluated and compared with 37 subjects with normal flow rates (group B). Static lung volumes, spirometric tests, exercise, and methacholine challenges were performed. RESULTS [...] Lung volumes were normal for both groups. Mean FEV 1 /VC% was 69 % for group A and 82 % for the control group. Salbutamol improved baseline FEV 1 in eight subjects in group A (mean 15 %), while methacholine induced a drop in FEV 1 in 12 subjects. The dose-response curve to methacholine reached a plateau in all the responders. None of the subjects in the control group improved their baseline FEV 1 /VC% to salbutamol, but three showed <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> similar to those in group A. CONCLUSIONS [...] <b>Bronchial</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> does not occur more often in asymptomatic subjects with mildly low FEV 1 /VC% so these subjects do not require special investigations for airway disease...|$|E
