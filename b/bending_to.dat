5|$|NY284 {{begins at}} the New Jersey state line {{in the town of}} Minisink as a northerly {{continuation}} of that state's Route284. The route heads northwest for a short distance into the village of Unionville, where it serves as the main thoroughfare through the community. In the center of the village, the highway reaches an intersection with County Route36 (CR36, named Main Street), which heads west to the New Jersey state line and becomes CR651 upon entering Sussex County. NY284 turns north at this junction, passing a handful of homes before <b>bending</b> <b>to</b> the northwest and leaving the village limits for less developed areas of Minisink.|$|E
5|$|NY93 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY18F (Main Street; co-designated but not signed as County Route907 or CR907) {{in the center}} of the village of Youngstown. The route proceeds eastward through the village as a two-lane road named Lockport Street, serving two blocks of commercial areas before <b>bending</b> <b>to</b> the northeast and passing into the residential eastern portion of Youngstown. At the eastern village limits, NY93 briefly widens to four lanes as it enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with the Niagara Scenic Parkway. Past the junction, the highway reverts to a two-lane road and changes names to YoungstownLockport Road as it runs across the town of Porter. The residential surroundings continue to the hamlet of Towers Corners, where NY93 connects to NY18 (Creek Road).|$|E
5|$|Past Phoenicia, the {{surrounding}} slopes become steeper {{as the road}} and creek curve around Panther Mountain, one of the Catskill High Peaks, to the south. At Allaben, the Shandaken Tunnel crosses under the road, bringing water from Schoharie Reservoir into the creek. The road and creek start <b>bending</b> <b>to</b> the south to the hamlet of Shandaken, where the town hall {{on the south side}} of the road is followed by the southern terminus of NY42's northern segment. As NY28 continues trending southwest, the valley becomes less developed. Balsam Mountain, another High Peak, looms ahead.|$|E

5|$|The tentacle-covered leaves {{can capture}} large prey, such as beetles, moths, and butterflies. The tentacles of all Drosera species have {{specialised}} stalked glands on the leaf's upper surface that produce a sticky mucilage. The leaves are considered active flypaper traps that respond to captured prey by <b>bending</b> <b>to</b> surround it. In its native fynbos habitat, the plants compete for space with native marsh grasses and low evergreen shrubs. Of the two known populations of D.regia, the higher altitude site {{appears to be}} overgrown and is essentially extirpated. The lower altitude site is estimated to have about 50 mature plants, making it the most endangered Drosera species, since it is threatened with extinction in the wild. It is often cultivated by carnivorous plant enthusiasts, and a single cultivar has been registered.|$|E
5|$|The Sprain Brook Parkway, {{designated}} by the New York State Department of Transportation as NY987F, a state reference route, begins at a fork from the Bronx River Parkway along the latter's right-of-way along the Bronx River {{in the city of}} Yonkers. Crossing through the Northeast Yonkers neighborhood as a six-lane freeway design, the Sprain Brook crosses an interchange with NY100 (Central Park Avenue) south of Andrus Park. <b>Bending</b> <b>to</b> the north through Yonkers, the Sprain Brook reaches an interchange with Tuckahoe Road, with the northbound and southbound lanes splitting around the Grassy Sprain Reservoir. The two directions bend northeast along the reservoir. The southbound lanes cross Sprain Ridge Park, while the northbound lanes cross through a golf course. Leaving Yonkers for the town of Greenburgh, the lanes of the Sprain Brook come back together, reaching an interchange with Jackson Avenue. The six lane parkway continues northward and to the northeast through Greenburgh, crossing under Ardsley Road. After turning northward once again, the Sprain Brook crosses under a former alignment of NY131 (Underhill Road) and passes by the Sunningdale Country Club.|$|E
5|$|The Red Army {{started the}} Vistula–Oder Offensive on 12 January 1945. The attack {{began with an}} intense {{bombardment}} by the guns of the 1st Ukrainian Front against elements of Army Group A, initially {{under the command of}} Generaloberst Josef Harpe. Within a matter of days the Soviet forces involved had advanced hundreds of kilometres, taking much of Poland and striking deep within the borders of the Reich. The offensive broke Army Group A, and much of Germany's remaining capacity for military resistance. The Soviet forces crossed the Silesian border on 19 January and Harpe was relieved of his command and replaced by Generaloberst Ferdinand Schörner on 20 January. Schörner established his headquarters at Oppeln. Here Strachwitz, on crutches, went to see Schörner, requesting a front command to defend his homeland. Schörner declined the offer and Strachwitz insisted on another assignment. <b>Bending</b> <b>to</b> the request, Schörner initially kept him in his staff where Strachwitz conceived the plan of creating a specialized Panzerjagdbrigade (tank-hunting brigade). The 3rd Guards Tank Army conquered Oppeln and Groß Strehlitz on 23 January 1945. The following day Groß Stein fell {{into the hands of the}} advancing Red Army and Strachwitz's palace and entire estate were confiscated. Schörner yielded to the demands of Strachwitz, and authorized the creation of the Panzerjägerbrigade. These brigades were not mechanized units but rather infantry soldiers deploying hand-held weapons such as the Panzerfaust. On 30 January 1945, he was promoted to Generalleutnant of the Reserves and organized his staff of the Panzerjäger-Brigade Oberschlesien at Bad Kudova—present-day Kudowa-Zdrój in Kłodzko Land.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of these tensions, a {{standoff}} started between the Americans and the Vietnamese generals. The U.S. had hoped the generals would relent because they could not survive without aid from Washington, and {{that they would not be}} able to repel the communists or rival officers without <b>bending</b> <b>to</b> receive support. On the other hand, Khánh hoped the Americans would become more worried about the communists first and acquiesce to their fait accompli against the HNC.|$|E

From NY12, NY12B proceeds north on North Main Street, while NY12 proceeds northeast on Utica Road. A mix of residences and businesses parallel NY12B, which leaves the village for the town of Sherburne to the northwest. NY12B parallels a railroad line to the north, passing Baldwin Station, where the railroad crosses. The route becomes rural, <b>bending</b> <b>to</b> the north through Sherburne and paralleling the Springfield River. The two-lane rural roadway continues north, crosses the county line into Madison County and entering the village of Earlville. In Earlville, NY12B doubles as North Main Street, a two-lane residential street that crosses through.|$|E

25|$|William soon {{dismissed}} the old ministry when he succeeded his childless brother as king in 1861 and appointed liberal ministers of his own, notably {{from his own}} court at Koblenz, including: Alexander von Schleinitz, who became Foreign Secretary; August von Bethmann, who became Minister of Culture; and Karl Anton of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen who became Minister President of Prussia. The conservative opponents saw this {{as the work of}} Augusta, but her political influence on William was rather small. This became evident a few months later, when he dissolved parliament, which was not <b>bending</b> <b>to</b> his will. The King appointed Otto von Bismarck as the new Prussian Minister President. Augusta, now Queen, regarded Bismarck as her mortal enemy and Bismarck likewise despised Augusta for her (albeit small) influence on her husband.|$|E
25|$|Although Sandford {{accepted}} imprisonment as {{the will}} of God, he had difficulty at first <b>bending</b> <b>to</b> prison regulations. But with sleep, proper nourishment, and enforced exercise, his health gradually improved. He even insisted that Shiloh residents drop whatever they were doing at 11:30 and 4:00 and exercise with him. He was made a gatekeeper and given a pass {{that allowed him to}} spend some time out of doors. He also volunteered to teach a group of prisoners how to read and write and especially enjoyed conducting a weekly Bible class that began with one student and grew to more than a hundred. Eventually Shiloh was allowed to send him a harp, and Sandford was not only able to practice, he gave at least two concerts at the prison.|$|E
25|$|NY142 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY7 (Hoosick Street) {{in the community}} of Brunswick Center, New York. The route heads to the northwest along Grange Road through the residential community, intersecting with local roads. At an intersection with County NY144 (CR144), also the eastern terminus of former NY317, NY142 passes through a large condominium complex before <b>bending</b> <b>to</b> the west and into Vanderheyden Park. Paralleling {{to the north of the}} park, NY142 intersects with a former alignment of itself through Brunswick. At the intersection with Farrell Road, NY142 turns northward into farmlands until the intersection with Haleah Drive in the city of Troy.
