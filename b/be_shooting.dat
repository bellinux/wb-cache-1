5|$|Although {{the first}} scene filmed was the final scene {{to appear in the}} film (shot during the filming of Attack of the Clones in 2000), {{principal}} photography on the film occurred from June 30, 2003 to September 17, 2003, with additional photography occurring at Shepperton Studios and Elstree Studios in London from August 2004 to January 31, 2005. The initial filming took place on sound stages at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, although practical environments were shot as background footage later to be composited into the film. These included the limestone mountains depicting Kashyyyk, which were filmed in Phuket, Thailand (they were later damaged by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami). The production company was also fortunate enough to <b>be</b> <b>shooting</b> {{at the same time that}} Mount Etna erupted in Italy. Camera crews were sent to the location to shoot several angles of the volcano that were later spliced into the background of the animatics and the final film version of the planet Mustafar.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} {{revealed}} that Bieber and Flatts would <b>be</b> <b>shooting</b> a video for the remix {{version of the}} song when TMZ revealed photos on Bieber on set of the video shoot. The photos pictured Bieber after a dramatic haircut, changing his trademark style over the previous two years. The video premiered during the ABC special, Rascal Flatts: Nothing Like This Presented by JC Penney, which aired March 12, 2011. The video begins with Rascal Flatts arriving in a Cadillac Escalade to a studio. Inside, they are directed to Bieber, who is playing the keyboard. Bieber then sings his lines, playing guitar, and is joined by Joe Don Rooney also on guitar, and Jay DeMarcus now on keyboard. The woman who directed the band into the studio now directs them and Bieber into another room with lights, to film the video. Gary LeVox then sings his lines, joined by Bieber for the chorus while Rooney is on guitar and DeMarcus playing a grand piano. All are wearing black, with Bieber in particular wearing a leather jacket, his signature dog tag, and grey Supras sneakers. During the sequence of the video, more behind-the-scenes action is shown, before it ends with only Bieber's silhouette shown, as his jacket is on the ground.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in September 2013, {{production}} spaces at the Bad Robot facility {{were converted}} for shooting of The Force Awakens {{for the benefit}} of shooting a minor portion of the film in the United States. The film's costume designer was Michael Kaplan, who had previously worked with Abrams on the films Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness. Film editors Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon, also long-term collaborators with Abrams, were also signed. In August 2013, it was announced that cinematographer Daniel Mindel would <b>be</b> <b>shooting</b> the film on 35 mm film (specifically Kodak 5219). In October 2013, other crew members were confirmed, including sound designer Ben Burtt, director of photography Daniel Mindel, production designers Rick Carter and Darren Gilford, costume designer Michael Kaplan, special effects supervisor Chris Corbould, re-recording mixer Gary Rydstrom, supervising sound editor Matthew Wood, visual effects supervisor Roger Guyett, and executive producer Jason McGatlin.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 2016, {{all seasons}} up to season 6 (which premiered on April 24, 2016) had been aired on HBO and all seasons had been {{released}} on DVD and/or Blu-Ray for home viewing (see List of Game of Thrones episodes). The company confirmed on July 18, 2016 that season 7 would consist of seven episodes {{instead of the usual}} ten, and would premiere later than usual, in mid-2017, because of the later filming schedule. This was necessary in order to <b>be</b> <b>shooting</b> during the winter season in Europe. Season 7 was expected to air in mid 2017. The first footage from the season was revealed in a new promotional video that featured clips from its new and returning original shows for the coming year on November 28, 2016, showcasing Jon Snow, Sansa Stark and Arya Stark. Like the previous season, it will largely consist of original content currently not found in Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, but also adapts material from the upcoming sixth and seventh novels: The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring.|$|E

25|$|They {{find that}} a large party has {{assembled}} at his home and that the champagne is already flowing. Present are Lebedyev, his daughter Vera, Ippolit, Burdovsky, Kolya, General Ivolgin, Ganya, Ptitsyn, Ferdyschenko, Keller, and, to Myshkin's surprise, Yevgeny Pavlovich, who has come to ask for his friendship and advice. The guests greet the Prince warmly and compete for his attention. Stimulated by Lebedyev's eloquence, everyone engages for some time in intelligent and inebriated disputation on lofty subjects, but the good-humoured atmosphere begins to dissipate when Ippolit suddenly produces a large red-sealed envelope and announces that it contains an essay he has written which he now intends to read to them. The essay {{is a series of}} verbose psychological observations on the subject of his own approaching death, written in a defiant, self-conscious style, and culminating in the announcement that, rather than go on living for a few more weeks, he will <b>be</b> <b>shooting</b> himself at sunrise. The reading drags on for over an hour and by its end, the sun has risen. Most of his audience, however, is bored and resentful, apparently not at all concerned that he is about to shoot himself. Only Vera, Kolya, Burdovsky and Keller seek to restrain him. He distracts them by pretending to abandon the plan, then suddenly pulls out a small pistol, puts it to his temple and pulls the trigger. There is a click but no shot: Ippolit faints but is not killed. It turns out, to the great amusement of some, that he had taken out the cap earlier and forgotten to put it back in. Ippolit is devastated and tries desperately to convince everyone that it was an accident. Eventually, he falls asleep and the party disperses.|$|E

500|$|Christopher McQuarrie, {{who went}} uncredited {{for his work}} on X-Men, was hired to write the {{screenplay}} for the Wolverine sequel in August 2009. According to Shuler-Donner, the sequel would focus on the relationship between Wolverine and Mariko, the daughter of a Japanese crime lord, and what happens to him in Japan. Wolverine would have a different fighting style due to Mariko's father having [...] "this stick-like weapon. There'll be samurai, ninja, katana blades, different forms of martial arts - mano-a-mano, extreme fighting." [...] She continued: [...] "We want to make it authentic so I think it's very likely we'll <b>be</b> <b>shooting</b> in Japan. I think it's likely the characters will speak English rather than Japanese with subtitles." [...] In January 2010, at the People's Choice Awards, Jackman stated that the film would start shooting sometime in 2011, and in March 2010 McQuarrie declared that the screenplay was finished for production to start in January the following year. Sources indicated Darren Aronofsky was in negotiations to direct the film after Bryan Singer turned down the offer.|$|E
500|$|Editing on {{location}} led to additional complications in post-production. The production {{was unwilling to}} risk sending undeveloped film through high-security airports where the cans could be opened, X-rayed, or damaged. Accordingly, film was hand-carried on a flight by a production assistant from Amman to London. After the Super 16mm film was transferred to DVcam at a lab in London, the video dailies were transported by plane back to the Middle East to be imported into the editing system. The whole journey would take anywhere from three days to a week and was described by Innis as the [...] "modern-day equivalent of shipping via donkey cart". The low production budget {{and the lack of}} a developed film infrastructure in the area hampered the process, according to Innis. [...] "We were working with grainy Super 16mm film, editing in standard definition. We tried doing FTP downloads, but at the time the facilities in Jordan simply couldn't handle it." [...] The producer Tony Mark later negotiated the use of a local radio station late at night to receive low-grade QuickTime clips over the Internet so the crew would not <b>be</b> <b>shooting</b> blindly.|$|E

500|$|After her promotional {{activities}} {{ended in}} Japan, Carey flew to Hawaii for a three-day music video shoot from June 8–10, 2008. The video {{was directed by}} Chris Applebaum and premiered on BET's 106 & Park on July 3, 2008 at 6:00pm ET/PT and on Yahoo! Music at midnight on the same day. It later appeared on Total Request Live (TRL) on July 7, 2008. Aside from the video's original version, the remix also featured an accompanying video, with some additional scenes from T.I. Some of the scenes were filmed on the beaches of Hawaii, {{while some of the}} smaller parts were shot in Wet'n'Wild Hawaii. According to several reports, Carey was seriously injured on the set of the video during shooting on June 9. Carey's representative quickly denied the allegation, and said [...] "She was so excited to <b>be</b> <b>shooting</b> in Hawaii. She wanted all her friends to come down and {{be a part of the}} shoot."

500|$|Mark Robson was {{strongly}} considered {{and was in}} talks to direct, but after seeing The Omen, the producers hired Richard Donner. Donner had previously been planning [...] when he was hired in January 1977 for $1million to direct Superman and Superman II. Donner felt {{it was best to}} start from scratch. [...] "They had prepared the picture for a year and not one bit was useful to me." [...] Donner was dissatisfied with the campy script and brought in Tom Mankiewicz to perform a rewrite. According to Mankiewicz [...] "not a word from the Puzo script was used." [...] "It was a well-written, but still a ridiculous script. It was 550 pages. I said, 'You can't shoot this screenplay because you'll <b>be</b> <b>shooting</b> for five years'," [...] Donner continued. [...] "That was literally a shooting script and they planned to shoot all 550 pages. You know, 110 pages is plenty for a script, so even for two features, that was way too much." [...] Mankiewicz conceived having each Kryptonian family wear a crest resembling a different letter, justifying the 'S' on Superman's costume. The Writers Guild of America refused to credit Mankiewicz for his rewrites, so Donner gave him a creative consultant credit, much to the annoyance of the Guild.|$|E
500|$|Alex Garland, {{a long-time}} friend of Ishiguro, asked the author {{for the rights}} to the novel before he had {{finished}} reading it. Before the novel was published in 2005, Garland had already written a script for a possible film. He gave the screenplay to two producers, Andrew Macdonald and Allon Reich, and development started at that moment. [...] "We are delighted to <b>be</b> <b>shooting</b> this special project, which Alex Garland first brought to us before the book's publication in 2005." [...] The script for the film was 96 pages long, and divided into chapters. Director Mark Romanek was originally attached to The Wolfman, but when he was dropped from that production for an unknown reason, he accepted the offer to work on Never Let Me Go. The movie was made into a dystopian drama. Romanek was glad to get the opportunity to shoot this film: [...] "From the moment I finished [...] the novel, it became my dream to film it. Ishiguro's conception is so daring, so eerie and beautiful. Alex Garland's adaptation is sensitive and precise. The cast is perfect, the crew superb." [...] The Seattle Times observed that the project was [...] "something of a departure" [...] for the novelist, noting that it merges Ishiguro's signature [...] "elegant prose with a decidedly science-fiction theme".|$|E
