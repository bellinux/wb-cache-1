40|$|The hydrogenolysis of <b>butanediols</b> was {{investigated}} and heterogeneous noble metal catalysts were synthesized for this reaction. Based {{on the model}} reaction of 2, 3 -butanediol to 2 -butanol, the commercially available catalyst ruthenium on carbon (Ru/C) {{was used to determine}} reaction parameters that allowed a kinetic analysis of the system without the influence of mass-transfer limitations. Subsequently, a kinetic investigation of the dehydration/hydrogenation sequence leading to the desired product 2 -butanol was performed. In addition to the rate constants, the reaction enthalpy was determined using the Eyring–Polanyi equation. The substrate scope was then expanded to include 1, 2 -, 1, 3 -, and 1, 4 -butanediol. In contrast to 2, 3 -butanediol, those substrates favored the C-C-bond cleavage by decarbonylation, leading to the various isomers of propanol. Additionally, in the case of 1, 3 -butanediol it was possible to strongly influence the selectivity of the hydrogenolysis by changing the metal component of the catalyst to nickel or copper. For 1, 4 -butanediol, cyclodehydration to tetrahydrofuran occurred in addition to the decarbonylation but could be suppressed by using a basic support material such as ceria. For the decarbonylation of the three additional <b>butanediols,</b> a kinetic analysis was also performed, as well as a reaction network analysis of all four <b>butanediols.</b> Deuteration experiments allowed the investigation of the reactivity of the different positions on the carbon chain. The experiments showed that the terminal positions possess a higher reactivity than the internal positions, and carbon atoms bearing a hydroxyl substituent are considerably more reactive than unsubstituted ones. The second part of this work was focused on the development of ruthenium catalysts for the hydrogenolysis, once again using 2, 3 -butanediol as a model substrate. Different classes of support materials were investigated. Carbon-based materials such as activated carbons, covalent triazine frameworks, and carbon nanotubes showed mostly low activities as well as low selectivities to the target product 2 -butanol. Moreover, several of them suffered from leaching of the catalytically active species during the reaction. Another group of support materials that were investigated are oxides. Acidic oxides such as alumina, silica, or zirconia afforded moderate conversions but {{led to the formation of}} side products. Basic oxides such as hydrotalcites were virtually inactive and mainly promoted the retro-aldol reaction. Only the catalyst based on amphoteric ceria showed high activity as well as ca. 80 % selectivity to 2 -butanol, and consequently an improved performance compared to the commercially available Ru/C. Therefore, Ru/CeO 2 was characterized using TPD, DRIFTS, TPR, and TEM to reach an insight into structure–activity relations. The good performance of the catalyst likely depends on two factors. One is the special interaction between support and metal species, the other a combination of basic and weakly acidic centers on the surface of the support material. For Ru/CeO 2, a kinetic analysis was performed as well as recycling experiments to investigate the long-term stability of the catalytic system. In these experiments, Ru/CeO 2 demonstrated good stability over several runs, which in addition to its high activity and selectivity makes it a promising catalyst for hydrogenolysis...|$|R

Optically active γ-lactones 2 can be particularly advantageous in the formation of acyclic chiral building blocks with arrays of methyl- and hydroxy-substituents at vicinal or remote chiral centers. For instance Hanessian and co-workers 3 reported the use of (S) - 4 -hydroxymethyl-butyrolactone in the synthesis of several amphotericin B segments.

40|$|SSCI-VIDE+CDFA+NPR:CPI:MBEInternational {{audience}} 1. IntroductionCatalytic hydrogenolysis of C 4 -C 6 sugar-derived polyols (e. g. erythritol, xylitol, sorbitol) in {{aqueous solution}} is an interesting pathway {{for the production of}} many value-added chemicals. 1 Both cleavage of C-C bonds and C-O bonds can occur. In these processes, selectivity is a major issue due to the multitude and sequential steps, which result in a mixture of products. One objective {{of this study was to}} optimize the catalyst and reaction conditions for the selective C-O bond cleavage (in detriment of C-C) of erythritol in order to produce partially deoxygenated chemicals such as butanetriols (BTO), <b>butanediols</b> (BDO), and butanols (BuOH). The challenge is that smaller C 2 -C 3 polyols can be obtained from C-C bond cleavage, in addition to cyclic molecules (by internal dehydration) and threitol by isomerization. These catalysts were then studied for the hydrogenolysis of sorbitol. On the other hand, the production of C 2 -C 3 polyols (i. e. ethylene glycol (EG), propylene glycol (PG), and glycerol (GL)) by C-C bond cleavage of xylitol is known to be favored in basic media. 2 The second objective of this work was to investigate the effect of Ca(OH) 2 amount for glycols production and to develop bifunctional catalysts associating a basic oxide and Ru sites on active carbon to operate in base-free conditions. 2. Experimental Ru catalysts were prepared by impregnation with aqueous solutions of Ru(NO) (NO 3) 3 of bare or basic oxide modified active carbon. Bimetallic Rh-ReOx catalysts supported on TiO 2 and ZrO 2 were prepared by successive impregnation with aqueous solutions of RhCl 3 and NH 4 ReO 4. The solids were dried, reduced in flowing H 2, and passivated with flowing 1 %O 2 in N 2. The experiments were performed in 300 mL batch reactors at 200 °C and under H 2 pressures in the range 40 - 120 bar. Quantitative analysis were performed using HPLC instruments equipped with RID and UV detectors in series, using Rezex ROA-Organic acid and RCM-monosaccharide Ca 2 + columns. The carbon balances was verified using a TOC-VCSH analyzer (Shimadzu). The catalysts were characterized by XPS, TEM, XRD and ICP and CO 2 -TPD. 3. Results and discussionC-O hydrogenolysisIn the selective hydrogenolysis of erythritol to BTO and BDO, the addition of ReOx species to supported rhodium metal enhanced the catalytic activity and selectivity towards C-O hydrogenolysis products. The influence of reaction conditions (e. g. temperature, pressure of H 2, acid additive, effect of support) were studied to optimize the selectivity to partially deoxygenated C 4 products. The selectivity to BTO increased from 10 - 13 % to 35 - 37 %, respectively, when the pressure increased from 30 to 120 bar. This enhancement was accompanied with the decrease in selectivity to BDO from 43 to 28 % (as a function of pressure) over Rh-ReOx/TiO 2. Conversely, no drastic changes were noticed in the presence of Rh-ReOx/ZrO 2 where the selectivity to BDO remained constant around 26 - 29 %. In the presence of both catalysts, the mass balance was > 90 % except under 30 bar of hydrogen. The loss of carbon in aqueous phase is due to the formation of short-chain compounds which have been transferred from the liquid phase to the gas phase, such as CO 2 or alkanes. C-C hydrogenolysis In neutral aqueous solution, the main reactions were epimerization of xylitol to arabitol and adonitol (C 5 alditols) at 80 % conversion of xylitol with a catalytic activity of 727 molxylitol. h- 1. molRu- 1. With the addition of Ca(OH) 2 (xylitol/OH-= 8. 5. 10 - 4), the activity decreased to 67 molxylitol. h- 1. molRu- 1, however the retro-aldol condensation was promoted and a combined selectivity to EG and PG of 25 % was observed. The best selectivities to EG (25 %) and PG (32 %) were obtained for the xylitol/OH- ratio of 0. 13. Beyond this value, the production of LA became predominant (25 %). In neutral conditions and in comparison with Ru/C catalyst, 3. 1 %Ru/ 4. 5 %MnO/C yielded lower concentrations of epimers and C 4 products and higher glycol production (selectivity of 34 %) with an activity of 220 molxylitol h- 1 molRu- 1. However, a substantial leaching of MnO was observed and must be due to the production of LA and other carboxylic acid compounds. Different ways to limit the leaching were explored. 4. Conclusions We have demonstrated that Rh-ReOx catalysts supported on TiO 2 and ZrO 2 are selective for C-O bond hydrogenolysis of erythritol. In the presence of 3. 7 wt%Rh– 3. 5 wt%ReOx/ZrO 2 catalyst, the highest selectivity to (BTO & BDO) reached 66 % at 80 % conversion of erythritol. Regarding C-C hydrogenolysis, the selectivity to the glycols is clearly dictated by the presence of a base. The addition of MnO oxide favors C-C cleavage by retro-aldol condensation in neutral conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{interest}} {{in the production of}} 1, 3 -butadiene these days is increasing in both academic and industrial research. Researchers are looking for alternative on-purpose production routes to replace the current 1, 3 -butadiene supply as byproduct in the naphtha steam crackers, for ethylene production, to disconnect the supply and price from the ethylene demand. Different routes are available for such on-purpose production of 1, 3 ‑butadiene, like the dehydrogenation of butane and butenes, the dehydration of <b>butanediols</b> and the conversion of ethanol to 1, 3 -butadiene. The current PhD research focusses on the chemo catalytic conversion of ethanol into 1, 3 -butadiene. This process has been operated on an industrial scale long time ago. Despite the former success, improvements, likely {{at the level of the}} catalyst properties, are necessary for this process to become competitive in the present-day industry. In this PhD research, an extensive catalyst research was therefore conducted with the aim to increase the catalytic activity and butadiene selectivity, and to understand the complex catalytic systems. Such a catalyst research will play an important role in the improvements necessary for this process and aid the eventual assessment of the economic viability of this ethanol-based production method. Our thermodynamic calculations proved that the conversion of ethanol into 1, 3 -butadiene become favorable above 150 °C and the preferred reaction temperature is between 325 and 430 °C. The calculations also illustrated that 1, 3 -butadiene is thermodynamically not the most favorable reaction product; ethylene and all isomers of butene are more favorable products. Therefore, a multifunctional catalyst for the 1, 3 -butadiene formation process should be capable of catalyzing selectively the different reactions, but avoiding the formation of the thermodynamically more stable side-products. Inspired by old literature, an extensive catalytic research was conducted focusing on magnesia-silica type materials for the 1, 3 -butadiene formation from ethanol. The influences of the synthesis procedure, the Mg/Si ratio and the nature of different dopants on the catalytic activity were studied. The binary magnesia-silica catalysts didn’t prove to be very active in the 1, 3 -butadiene formation reaction. The modification of the magnesia-silica support with transition metal(oxide) s by means of a consecutive impregnation step significantly increased the ethanol conversion and 1, 3 -butadiene yield. Catalysts containing CuO, ZnO and Ag dopants obtained 1, 3 -butadiene yields higher than 50 % at full ethanol conversion. In the next part of this work, a thorough investigation was conducted on the silver doped magnesia-silica catalysts. The influences of the silver content and the type of silica material on the catalytic performance were studied in depth. The prepared catalysts were characterized by different techniques such as 29 Si NMR, N 2 sorption, SAXS, XRD, ESEM/EDX, IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine and CO 2, CO 2 ‑TPD and UV-vis DRS. It was shown that the contact with water during the impregnation of silver resulted in changes of the pore structure and in the formation of an amorphous magnesium silicate phase on the final catalyst. These changes also resulted in an increase of the Lewis acidity and basicity of the final catalyst. The catalytic results were combined with the characterization results to explain the catalytic activity of the silver doped magnesia-silica catalysts. The addition of silver increases the dehydrogenation activity of the magnesia-silica catalysts. The rate-determining step in the 1, 3 -butadiene formation therefore shifts from the dehydrogenation on silver-free catalysts to the aldol condensation on silver doped catalysts. These rate-determining reactions are catalyzed by, respectively, the silver species and the basic sites (MgO-pairs and basic OH groups) present on the surface of the active catalysts. The following steps in the reaction sequence, MPV reduction of crotonaldehyde and dehydration of crotyl alcohol, are catalyzed by, respectively, Lewis acidic Mg(II) atoms and mildly acidic silanol groups. The optimal silver loading is 1 ‑ 2 wt% silver for a magnesia-silica catalyst with a molar Mg/Si ratio of 2. The highest 1, 3 -butadiene productivity was reached at higher reaction temperatures, with a record productivity of almost 0. 3 gram butadiene per gram catalyst per hour at 480 °C and a WHSV of 1. 2 per hour. In the final part, the obtained information about the silver doped magnesia-silica catalysts is used to make alterations in the preparation method to gain further insights and improvements in this complex catalytic system and increase their catalytic activity. First, the sequence of the preparation method was altered. For these types of catalysts, silver was loaded on the silica source before mixing with the Mg source. Secondly, different solvents are introduced in the preparation method, both during the mixing of the Mg and Si sources and during the impregnation of silver, to control the contact between the MgO and SiO 2 phases and to control the formation of the magnesium silicate phase. Both alternative procedures are able to create active and selective catalysts for the conversion of ethanol into 1, 3 -butadiene, only when the magnesia and silica phase were simultaneously contacted with water. Both methods demonstrate the importance of the simultaneous contact with water, resulting in the formation of a magnesium silicate phase. The magnesium silicate phase is a vital part of the final active catalyst. The dehydrogenation and aldol condensation activity are significantly higher in the presence of the magnesium silicate phase, resulting in significantly higher 1, 3 -butadiene yields and productivities compared to catalysts without a magnesium silicate phase. The combination of catalytic experiments with thorough physicochemical characterizations was the foundations for the interpretation of the catalytic activity of the magnesia-silica materials. The novel insights, gained during this PhD research, also led to the construction of a tentative reaction pathway model explaining the role of the different active sites on the multifunctional catalyst in the conversion of ethanol into 1, 3 ‑butadiene. nrpages: 175 status: publishe...|$|R
