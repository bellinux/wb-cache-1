5|$|Chicago's win {{clinched}} the team's 15th postseason berth in franchise history, their first in 9 years since losing in the 1989 National League Championship Series. The Cubs' {{presence in the}} postseason, playing for {{a spot in the}} World Series, led several sportswriters to reference the Curse of the <b>Billy</b> <b>Goat</b> and the difficulties the Cubs' had faced since 1945. The <b>Billy</b> <b>Goat</b> story suggests that Billy Sianis cursed the Cubs after he and his goat were asked to leave game four of the 1945 World Series. The playoff berth matched the Cubs with the Atlanta Braves in the NLDS, where the Cubs were swept 3 games to 0. The Cubs would have to wait another 18 years to win the National League pennant and World Series in 2016, their first NL pennant since 1945, and their first title since 1908.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} {{domestic animal}} {{could also be}} regarded as a zduhać, such as a shepherd dog, ox, bellwether, horse, or <b>billy</b> <b>goat.</b> If an animal habitually made vocal sounds in sleep, it was assumed to be a zduhać. Such an animal was cherished, and was not for sale. The spirit of the animal zduhać would leave its body in sleep and fight against the enemy zduhaći, to protect its own flock or herd. Only the fertility of the livestock depended on the outcome of the battles fought by the animal zduhaći; they had no bearing on the crop yield. In the region of Užice, western Serbia, it was believed that storms and hail clouds were led by zduhaći who flew above them in the form of big birds. A black ox and a three-year-old rooster defended their village from them—especially the rooster, for which reason he was not killed for food, but kept as a home guardian. In folk spells for repelling hail clouds in Serbia, these clouds were called white cattle. This could be compared with the idea of the black ox as a defender from hail.|$|E

25|$|The rock-haunting {{ringtail}} possum eats fruits, {{flowers and}} leaves {{of a variety}} of trees found near its habitat and occasionally feeds on termites. It usually stays close to the rocks while feeding but has been found as far as 100m from the nearest outcrop. Most common of the blossoms it eats are of Darwin Woollybutt (Eucalyptus miniata) and Darwin Stringybark (Eucalyptus tetrodonta). Its major fruit intake is from Zyziphus oenoplia, Vitex glabrata, <b>Billy</b> <b>Goat</b> Plum (Terminalia ferdinandiana), and Owenia vernicosa. Leaves eaten include Flagelleria indica, Pouteria sericea and Vine Reedcane.|$|E
500|$|During the Chattanooga Campaign in November, under Grant's overall command, Sherman quickly {{took his}} {{assigned}} target of <b>Billy</b> <b>Goat</b> Hill {{at the north}} end of Missionary Ridge, only to discover that it was not part of the ridge at all, but rather a detached spur separated from the main spine by a rock-strewn ravine. When he attempted to attack the main spine at Tunnel Hill, his troops were repeatedly repulsed by Patrick Cleburne's heavy division, the best unit in Bragg's army. Sherman's efforts were assisted by George Henry Thomas's army's successful assault on the center of the Confederate line, a movement originally intended as a diversion. [...] Subsequently, Sherman led a column to relieve Union forces under Ambrose Burnside thought to be in peril at Knoxville. [...] In February 1864, he led an expedition to Meridian, Mississippi, to disrupt Confederate infrastructure.|$|E

500|$|The puzzle was {{simplified}} in The Shadow of the Templars 2009 [...] by, {{according to}} Cecil, adding a more logical solution. This {{version of the}} game includes a diary, in which the character takes notes; After completing the goat puzzle, George's diary reads: [...] "So the 'ghost of Lochmarne' {{is no more than}} a fierce <b>Billy</b> <b>goat.</b> For a moment I thought it was going to be incredibly awkward to get past, but in the end it was surprisingly simple. Who would have known?", as a reference to the original puzzle's reputation. An easter egg involving a talking goat was included in The Shadow of the Templars sequel, [...] (1997).

500|$|When {{sufficiently}} stressed or threatened, {{this species}} engages in a characteristic threat display that includes vibrating its tail and throwing its head back with its mouth open {{to display the}} startling white interior, often making a loud hiss while the neck and front {{part of the body}} are pulled into an S-shaped position. Many of its common names, including [...] "cottonmouth" [...] and [...] "gaper", refer to this behavior, while its habit of snapping its jaws shut when anything touches its mouth has earned it the name [...] "trap jaw" [...] in some areas. Other defensive responses can include flattening the body and emitting a strong, pungent secretion from the anal glands located {{at the base of the}} tail. This musk may be ejected in thin jets if the snake is sufficiently agitated or restrained. The smell has been likened to that of a <b>billy</b> <b>goat,</b> as well as to a genus of common flood-plain weeds, Pluchea, that also have a penetrating odor.|$|E
500|$|For {{the second}} season, {{production}} credited 16 cities located in 11 countries {{for having been}} part of the filming. The major locations they filmed in, include all of the first season's except Reykjavík, and the following new ones: Amsterdam, Argyll, Chippenham, Los Angeles, Malta, Positano, Redwoods, and São Paulo. Production start for the main unit of the second season was given an expected date of March 2016, but a separate shoot involving the principal actors began on December 30, 2015, in Berlin, to capture footage during the Christmas holidays. This was followed by a short two-day shoot in Chicago, on January 23 and 24, 2016. Filming resumed in Berlin in the middle of March 2016, and proceeded to Mumbai on March 25, for a 10-day shoot. On April 7, filming started in Positano. Aml Ameen did not participated in the filming, as he had decided to depart from the production. Later in April, filming moved to Mexico, with Toby Onwumere replacing the departed Ameen, and specifically to Mexico City, and for one day in Metepec. Filming in California, San Francisco, began around May 5, and lasted up to May 20. Location manager Matthew Riutta was fined by the Department of Parks and Recreation when [...] "someone accidentally got naked", during a romantic scene set at the tree swing in <b>Billy</b> <b>Goat</b> Hill. A short two-day shoot in Los Angeles, Malibu followed, starting May 24. Filming in São Paulo took place in late May, and specifically in its 20th Gay Pride Parade on May 29. Participating in the event was a late decision taken by Lana two days before the Parade began, as the production had previously abandoned their plans for the location due to scheduling conflicts. When Lana realized she could make it fit, they flew to São Paulo and filmed in the event in front of a crowd of millions, unrehearsed. Filming in Chicago began on June 5, and wrapped up on June 15, then moved to the United Kingdom, in London, Cambridge (Chippenham Park), and Scotland (Ardkinglas Estate and Castle Stalker, for 9 days), and wrapped on July 4. Then, filming moved to the Netherlands, in Amsterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht, for about two weeks, up to July 19. In Amsterdam, they were the first production to film in the Rijksmuseum, with the real paintings of Rembrandt featured prominently in the scenes. Lana was told that insurance would never allow her to film there, but after writing an eight-page letter about what The Night Watch means to her and the importance of bringing art to the homes of those that are unable to go to Rijksmuseum, she eventually managed to get a permit. In Amsterdam's club Paradiso, they filmed Tuppence Middleton DJing with a real audience, {{and the rest of the}} cast dancing. After the Netherlands, filming proceeded to Nairobi as early as July 22, and later to South Korea, in Seoul and Bucheon, for the production's longest shoot, lasting about three weeks. Afterwards, filming moved to Berlin, until September 14, and during the same period, they also briefly returned to London to shoot outside the Houses of Parliament for two days. Filming then moved to Malta on September 18, for a two-day shoot, where they used the water tanks in Kalkara. On September 19, 2016, with the completion of the Malta shoot, filming for the second season came to an end. Overall, the cast and crew flew in excess of 250,000 miles to complete the season, while some directors and producers who also did location scouting flew as much as 370,000 miles.|$|E

2500|$|The {{stretch of}} canal between locks {{is called a}} level. Canalers called these levels by their lengths; for instance, the longest level was the 14 mile level, which was about 14 miles long, and ran from Lock 50 (at 4 locks) to Lock 51 in Hancock. Some levels had {{additional}} nicknames (since some had similar lengths), e.g. [...] "Four Mile Level below Dam 6", [...] "Four Mile Level Big Slackwater", or [...] "Four Mile Level of the Log Wall" [...] (which is between locks 14 and 15, includes Widewater, Anglers, Carderock, <b>Billy</b> <b>Goat</b> Trails B, and C, and the downstream entrance to Trail A, all connect on that level) Levels {{less than a mile}} between locks were called short levels. Waste weirs and bypass flumes at the locks helped control the height of water in the levels (see below about waste weirs).|$|E
2500|$|Having {{successfully}} {{lifted the}} Siege of Chattanooga, General Grant now resolved on a double envelopment of Bragg's army, wherein Major General William T. Sherman would attack with 20,000 {{men from the}} north along Missionary Ridge, while Major General Joseph Hooker would attack from the south along Lookout Mountain, overwhelm the Southern forces there, then continue on to cut off Bragg's retreat while Sherman and Thomas pummeled him {{from the north and}} west. The contest kicked off on the morning of November 24, as Hooker drove Confederate forces from Lookout Mountain in the so-called [...] "Battle Above the Clouds," [...] while Sherman crossed the Tennessee River and took up positions along what he thought was the far edge of Missionary Ridgeonly to learn that he had occupied a nearby hill, called <b>Billy</b> <b>Goat</b> Hill, instead. The 33rd Alabama, entrenched atop the south end of Missionary Ridge near Bragg's headquarters, heard the sounds of battle on Lookout Mountain, but could not see the action due to a dense fog that had enveloped it.|$|E
