30|$|We {{say that}} a {{portfolio}} ϕ is constrained if {{at least one of}} the components of the process ϕ is assumed to satisfy some explicitly stated constraints, which directly affect the choice of ϕ. For instance, we will need to impose conditions ensuring that the funding of each risky asset is done using the corresponding funding account. Another example of an explicit constraint is obtained when we set ψ ^ 0,b_u = 0 for all u∈[t,T], meaning that an outright <b>borrowing</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> from the account B 0,b is prohibited. For examples of markets with various kinds of portfolio constraints, we refer to Carassus et al. (2001), Fahim and Huang (2016), Karatzas and Kou (1996, 1998), and Pulido (2014) and the references therein. The concept of a constrained portfolio should be contrasted with the notion of admissibility of a trading strategy that may involve some additional conditions imposed on the wealth process and thus indirectly also on the class of admissible processes ϕ (see Definition 8). Note that portfolio constraints are not a matter of choice, since they are due to genuine real-life restrictions imposed on traders. This should be contrasted with the idea of admissibility of a trading strategy, which is a mathematical artefact needed to preclude unrealistic arbitrage opportunities (like doubling strategies), which may be present within a stochastic model when continuous trading is allowed. Note in this regard that there is no need to be concerned with the admissibility under the realistic assumption that only a finite number of trading times is available to traders.|$|E

ABSTRACT: Basing on agency theory this empirical study explores the effect of corporate governance on managerial cash holding decisions. For {{the sake of a}} testable propositions concerning the determinants <b>of</b> corporate <b>cash</b> holdings, different theories <b>of</b> corporate <b>cash</b> holdings are reviewed (pecking order theory, trade off theory and free cash flow theory). The investigation is performed using panel data procedure for a sample of 138 firms listed on Karachi Stock Exchange during 2008 - 12. The results suggest that cash flow is the only variable which is statistically significant and positively related to cash holdings. Alternatively, liquidity, leverage, bank <b>borrowing</b> variability <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> flow is significantly and negatively related to cash holdings. Dividend, market-to-book ratio and ratio of non-executive to total directors are positively whereas firm size family dummy and CEO duality are negatively related to cash holdings but the relationships are insignificant. In particular managerial ownership (MAN) and MAN 3 is negative but significant however MAN 2 is positively related to cash holdings. These variations in sings indicate the non-linear relationship between managerial ownership and cash holdings.

Formally, a simple combination of two self-financing strategies is no longer a self-financing strategy, in general. Furthermore, if we take into account the limited supply of investment grade assets (perhaps also inclusive of the bank account), then any strategy needs to satisfy suitable portfolio constraints, which could imply that the additional cash amount received by the hedger will necessarily be used to purchase assets with a much higher exposure to substantial losses.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{contribute}} to the post-Keynesian/Kaleckian macroeconomic literature. We develop a macroeconomic model that explicitly integrates the role <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> and <b>cash</b> payment commitments on outstanding debt (interest plus principal repayment) into the consumption and investment expenditures, as well as into the inflation-generating process. We explore the way that finance influences the distribution effects of inflation in the demand-side of a money/credit-using economy; we suggest a new Phillips curve that encapsulates the impact of financial commitments on wage and profit claims. We argue that high debt and cash payment commitments are likely to be associated with a positive demand-side effect of inflation on the rate of employment; and that they might be conducive to a negative supply-side effect of employment on the inflation rate.

The platform is a network of journalists, researchers and media agencies dedicated to analyzing and publishing leaked content to make governments and corporations accountable for their actions by bringing them into light.According to the Associated Whistleblowing Press, the main objective moving Ljost platform is to restore the media as an active player for truth and justice in Iceland, believing transparency as the best way to increase social accountability of local governments and corporations for their actions. AWP members believe that for journalists, researchers and media activists, this is a powerful way to lead people to take action against repression, abuse of power, censorship, social inequality and corporate greed in Icelandic society.On December 30, 2013, Ljost published the Glitnir Files, a leak that brings into public account detailed information identifying Glitnir bank’s biggest borrowers and stakeholders as well as relevant track of some its shares movements during 2007/2008 and evidence that a handful of individuals and companies with strong connections to Glitnir's central shareholders <b>borrowed</b> large amounts <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> from the bank, often with insufficient underlying collateral.|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} essay, "The Source <b>of</b> <b>Cash</b> and Its Marginal Value," we study the {{relation}} between the source <b>of</b> firms' <b>cash</b> holdings and the value <b>of</b> the <b>cash</b> to shareholders. The marginal value of a dollar <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> holdings depends on the source of the dollar: $ 1. 00 <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> has a value of $ 1. 27 when it is from operations, $ 0. 80 when from financing, and $ 0. 46 when from investing. Within the same source, the marginal value of an added dollar <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> holdings is significantly higher than the absolute value of a subtracted dollar. Shareholders of financially constrained or distressed firms value incremental cash holdings from almost any source more highly than do shareholders of unconstrained or stronger firms, but differences in value remain across the sources <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> within each subsample. Agency costs and information asymmetry are two frictions that appear to have the largest impact upon the value <b>of</b> <b>cash.</b> In the second essay, "Explanations for Diverging Values of Cash," we further explain the differing values <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> found in the first essay.
