5|$|From the 1950s until 2009 the {{buildings}} were used as a barn for animals and agricultural machinery. It has since been restored and had a <b>biomass</b> <b>boiler</b> installed.

The building now acts as a visitor centre, which includes access to the dynamo room where acetylene gas was produced along with a thermalume generator which produced gas from petrol and air.|$|E
5|$|In total, 36% of all {{materials}} and labour costs were spent in Wales, with approximately 1,000tonnes (157,500 stone) of Welsh slate used. The environmental {{features of the}} building have allowed energy savings of between 30% and 50% compared to buildings without these features. The features include 27 pipes that were drilled 100m below ground, so that during cold spells, water is pumped through the pipes and heated to 14°C by geothermal energy. The hot water is then pumped {{back up to the}} slate floor to warm the building to a constant temperature. In warm spells, the same system helps to keep the building cool. A <b>biomass</b> <b>boiler</b> was installed to use wood chips from recycled waste wood to heat the building, and rainwater is collected from the roof to flush the toilets in the building.|$|E

50|$|Although {{based on}} the Energy Act 2008, the Non-domestic RHI was not {{introduced}} until November 2011. Although intended to support a range of renewable heat technologies, nearly all the initial incentives were paid for <b>biomass</b> <b>boilers.</b> The larger initial tariffs for <b>biomass</b> <b>boilers</b> decreased the demand for other renewable technologies including heat pumps and solar thermal. From May 2014 the Non-domestic RHI tariffs have been realigned with increased tariffs for {{ground source heat pumps}} and the introduction of RHI tariffs for air to water heat pumps. The effect of prescriptive legislation has been to inhibit innovation in renewable technologies - although one of the stated aims of the RHI has been to encourage innovation.|$|R
