2500|$|The {{storage ring}} cell {{structure}} has a fairly compact lattice with twelve straight sections available for injection, RF cavities and 9 sections available for insertion devices.

The ring circumference is 171m, with a straight section length of 5.2m. The CLS is {{the smallest of the}} newer synchrotron facilities, which results in a relatively high horizontal beam emittance of 18.2nm-rad.

2500|$|Because the {{divergence}} is {{inversely proportional}} to the spot size, for a given wavelength λ, a Gaussian beam that is focused to a small spot diverges rapidly as it propagates away from the focus. Conversely, to minimize the divergence of a laser beam in the far field (and increase its peak intensity at large distances) it must have a large crossection (w0) at the waist (and thus a large diameter where it is launched, since w(z) is never less than w0 [...] ). This relationship between beam width and divergence is a fundamental characteristic of diffraction, and of the Fourier transform which describes Fraunhofer diffraction. A beam with any specified amplitude profile also obeys this inverse relationship, but the fundamental Gaussian mode is a special case where the product of <b>beam</b> <b>size</b> at focus and far-field divergence is smaller than for any other case.|$|E

One example of such an object is a light (In 3D graphics, lights function similarly to real-world lights. They cause illumination, cast shadows, and create specular highlights). Lights have many parameters including light intensity, <b>beam</b> <b>size,</b> light color, and the texture cast by the light.

The luminosity is determined directly with tungsten-silicon calorimeters and indirectly through an accurate measure-ment of the beam lifetime. The tune shift is measured from the tune spectrum in collision. Beam-beam deflec-tion scans provide information about the <b>beam</b> <b>sizes</b> and separation at the interaction points.
