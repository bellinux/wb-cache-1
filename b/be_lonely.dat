25|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between feeling lonely and being socially isolated (for example, a loner). In particular, one way of thinking about loneliness is as a discrepancy between one's necessary and achieved levels of social interaction, while solitude is simply the lack of contact with people. Loneliness is therefore a subjective experience; if a person thinks they are lonely, then they are lonely. People can <b>be</b> <b>lonely</b> while in solitude, or {{in the middle of a}} crowd. What makes a person lonely is the fact that they need more social interaction or a certain type of social interaction that is not currently available. A person can be in the middle of a party and feel lonely due to not talking to enough people. Conversely, one can be alone and not feel lonely; even though there is no one around that person is not lonely because there is no desire for social interaction. There have also been suggestions that each person has their own sweet spot of social interaction. If a person gets too little or too much social interaction, this could lead to feelings of loneliness or over-stimulation.|$|E

500|$|... "Ready, Set, Don't Go" [...] is {{a country}} song {{performed}} by American singers Billy Ray Cyrus and Miley Cyrus. It was released as the lead single from Home at Last, Billy Ray Cyrus' tenth studio album. The song is a soft country ballad with some use of pop and soft rock elements.

500|$|Besides the Pelopid line, and {{whatever}} {{remained of the}} Atlantid stemmata among which it ultimately belongs, little is known for certain about the further content of book 4.

A family springing from the river Asopus has also been proposed for this region based {{on the presence of}} [...] "several persons or families that other sources represent as descended from daughters of Asopos." [...] The most notable family that would belong to this section is that of Asopus' daughter Aegina, the nymph of the island that bears her name who slept with Zeus and bore Aeacus.

500|$|Throughout the song, {{the lyrics}} {{seemingly}} show the evolving {{relationship between the}} couple. Carey sings Anytime you need a friend / I will be here / You'll never be alone again / So don't you fear / Even if you're miles away / I'm by your side / So don't you ever <b>be</b> <b>lonely</b> / Love will make it alright, which hints at a current friendship where more still uncovered emotions are present. Author Chris Nickson explains on the song's switch in relationship, as the lyrics change to If you just believe in me / I will love you endlessly / Take my hand / Take me into your heart / I'll be there forever baby / I won't let go / I'll never let go. The protagonist is {{willing to accept the}} relationship as only a friend, but tells her partner that no matter his feelings for her, she loves him and still wishes to be loved by him, something she will never forget or [...] "let go".|$|E

Another 35% said they were not surprised by the album's ranking, but doubted Invincible would hold on for a second week {{at the top of the}} chart. Only 12% of people who responded to the poll said they were surprised by the album's charting debut because of Jackson's career over past six years and another 9% were taken aback by the album's success, in light of the negativity that preceded the album's release. Invincible received one Grammy Award nomination at the 2002 ceremony. The album's song [...] "You Rock My World" [...] was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Performance - Male, but lost to James Taylor's [...] "Don't Let Me <b>Be</b> <b>Lonely</b> Tonight".

500|$|In critiquing {{the rise}} of Internet-based computing, the {{philosophical}} {{question of whether or}} not a society can control technological progress was raised. At the online scientific magazine Edge, Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger argued that individual will was all that was necessary to maintain the cognitive capacity to read a book all the way through, and computer scientist and writer Jaron Lanier rebuked the idea that technological progress is an [...] "autonomous process that will proceed in its chosen direction independently of us". Lanier echoed a view stated by American historian Lewis Mumford in his 1970 book The Pentagon of Power, in which Mumford suggested that the technological advances that shape a society could be controlled if the full might of a society's free will were employed. Lanier believed that technology was significantly hindered by the idea that [...] "there is only one axis of choice" [...] which is either pro- or anti- when it comes to technology adoption. Yet Carr had stated in The Big Switch that he believed an individual's personal choice toward a technology had little effect on technological progress. According to Carr, the view expressed by Mumford about technological progress was incorrect because it regarded technology solely as advances in science and engineering rather than as an influence on the costs of production and consumption. Economics were a more significant consideration in Carr's opinion because in a competitive marketplace the most efficient methods of providing an important resource will prevail. As technological advances shape society, an individual might be able to resist the effects but his lifestyle will [...] "always <b>be</b> <b>lonely</b> and in the end futile"; despite a few holdouts, technology will nevertheless shape economics which, in turn, will shape society.|$|E
