The Waif questions who the other names were on the list, which Arya reveals as Cersei Lannister, Gregor Clegane, and Walder Frey.|$|E
5|$|Intrigued by the article, Valiente wrote {{a letter}} to Williamson in 1952, who in turn put her in contact with Gardner. Valiente and Gardner wrote several letters back-and-forth, with the latter {{eventually}} suggesting that she meet him at the home of his friend and fellow Wiccan Edith Woodford-Grimes ("Dafo"), who lived not far from Bournemouth, in the Christchurch area. <b>Before</b> <b>she</b> <b>left</b> the meeting, Gardner gave her a copy of his 1949 novel, High Magic's Aid, in which he describes a fictionalised account of Wiccan initiates in the Middle Ages; he allegedly did so in order to gauge her opinion on ritual nudity and scourging, both of which were present in his tradition of Gardnerian Wicca.|$|E
5|$|In July, Furious {{embarked}} nine Fulmars of 800 Squadron, 'A' Flight of 880 Squadron {{with four}} Sea Hurricane IBs, nine Swordfish from 812 Squadron and nine Albacores of 817 Squadron {{to attack the}} German-occupied ports of Kirkenes, Norway, and Petsamo, Finland, departing Scapa Flow on the 23rd in company with the carrier , two cruisers and six destroyers. The two carriers and their escorts gathered in Seidisfjord, Iceland, {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Wake-Walker where they refuelled in late July. Furious attacked ships in Petsamo on 30 July with all of her Swordfish and Albacores, escorted by six Fulmars and all four Sea Hurricanes, but there was very little shipping present. One small ship, MV Trotter, was sunk, several oil storage tanks were set afire, and several wooden jetties were torpedoed. The British ships had been spotted before the attack and two Fulmars and an Albacore were shot down by the alerted defences. Furious was short of fuel and had to leave shortly afterwards, but she transferred her Albacores to Victorious to fill up that carrier's decimated squadrons <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>left.</b> Sea Hurricanes of 880 Squadron shot down a shadowing Dornier Do 18 flying boat on 31 July as the ship was leaving.|$|E

60|$|It was {{too late}} for her to rise now, as his hands held both hers, and his {{handsome}} mouth was smiling level with her own.

50|$|At {{this point}} records conflict. Captain J. Davies {{replaced}} Rigmaiden. He delivered his slaves to Santo Domingo in 1792. Alternatively, James Harrocks replaced Rigmaiden, {{only to be}} replaced by Davies. Then on 12 June 1792 Banastre arrived in Dominica from Bight of Bonny with 239 slaves. She had loaded 295, but 53 had died <b>before</b> <b>she</b> even <b>left</b> the African coast.|$|R

25|$|In 1791 Molyneux again {{sailed to}} West Central Africa and St. Helena. Christopher arrived at Dominica from Congo, Kicongo, and Manikongo on 14 December. The numbers of slaves {{involved}} exhibit some inconsistencies. Supposedly, she embarked 273, of whom {{two men and}} two women died <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>left</b> the African coast. She landed 269: 176 men, 66 women, 22 boys, and five girls in all, for a mortality rate of only 1.5%.|$|E
25|$|White {{was paid}} $122,536 in 2001. Exactly when White took {{a pay cut}} is unclear, how her pay was cut, and why, is unclear. By one report, she {{received}} an $11,000 pay cut shortly <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>left.</b> Another report said that her salary decreased in February 2002, but also quoted a spokesman {{as saying that the}} main difference in pay between the years was because she got a bonus in 2001 but not 2002.|$|E
60|$|When Mrs Flintwinch dreamed, {{she usually}} dreamed, unlike {{the son of}} her old {{mistress}}, with her eyes shut. She had a curiously vivid dream that night, and <b>before</b> <b>she</b> had <b>left</b> the son of her old mistress many hours. In fact it {{was not at all}} like a dream; it was so very real in every respect. It happened in this wise.|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen!" [...] she repeated, {{making a}} great effort to calm herself, to regain {{something}} of that frame of mind in which their love had assumed the proportions of folly and madness, to summon up the scruples which, <b>before</b> <b>she</b> had <b>left</b> home that morning, she had resolved to lay <b>before</b> him, which <b>she</b> knew would return when she could be alone again. [...] "I have to think--you won't," [...] she exclaimed, with a fleeting smile.|$|R

25|$|Formed by {{siblings}} Ciarán, Pól, and Máire Brennan {{and their}} twin uncles Noel and Pádraig Duggan, the band were initially known as Clann as Dóbhair; in 1973 {{they changed their}} name to Clannad. By 1979 they had released three albums and completed a successful US tour. From 1980 to 1982, they recorded and toured as a six-piece group with Enya Brennan on additional keyboards and vocals, <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>left</b> the group to pursue a solo career.|$|E
25|$|After the {{commencement}} of the Napoleonic Wars, Captain Robert Torin required a new letter of marque, which he received in absentia on 20 June 1803, after he had sailed Coutts from the Downs on 6 May. <b>Before</b> <b>she</b> <b>left</b> for China, the artist John Constable sailed in her in April from London to Deal; Captain Torin {{was a friend of}} Constable's father. Coutts arrived at Whampoa on 1 October. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 11 January 1804.|$|E
25|$|Saracen {{conveyed}} General Gauthier and {{his staff}} to Ancona. From there she sailed to Venice to join the blockade there.

60|$|She had {{not gone}} far <b>before</b> <b>she</b> {{commenced}} to realize how slight were her chances for survival without means of defense or a weapon to bring down meat. Why had she not thought to strip the cartridge belt from Malbihn's waist <b>before</b> <b>she</b> had <b>left</b> his tent! With cartridges for the revolver she might hope to bag small game, and to protect herself from {{all but the most}} ferocious of the enemies that would beset her way back to the beloved hearthstone of Bwana and My Dear.|$|R
6000|$|There was a coach {{which started}} in those days from York at noon, {{reaching}} London early on the following day. He would go up by this coach, and would thus avoid the necessity of much further association with his family before he had decided what should be his conduct.

25|$|At Talkback Thames, Heggessey was {{responsible}} for overseeing the production of high-profile programmes such as ITV1's The Bill and The X Factor, BBC One's QI and Channel 4's Green Wing.

25|$|Miranda was discreet, {{and little}} is known about her private life. <b>Before</b> <b>she</b> <b>left</b> for the U.S., she had {{relationships}} with Mario Cunha, Carlos da Rocha Faria (son of a traditional family in Rio de Janeiro) and Aloysio de Oliveira, a member of the Bando da Lua. In the U.S., Miranda maintained relationships with John Payne, Arturo de Córdova, Dana Andrews, Harold Young, John Wayne, Donald Buka and Carlos Niemeyer. During her later years, in addition to heavy smoking and alcohol consumption, she began taking amphetamines and barbiturates and they took a toll on her health.|$|E
25|$|Captain John Craig {{was again}} her captain {{when she left}} The Downs on 3 April 1815. A few days <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>left</b> a violent gale carried away two anchors and cables.

In December she loaded the 59th Regiment of Foot and {{conveyed}} them to Madras. At Madras she grounded on the Pulicat shoal and her crew had to throw some of her cargo overboard to lighten her.

50|$|Richardson {{decided on}} a career in Parliament at an early age, <b>before</b> <b>she</b> even <b>left</b> high school.

After graduating, she worked for the Department of Justice, again {{following}} Sir Roy Jack's advice. In 1975, Richardson married Andrew Wright, a colleague from the Department.|$|R
60|$|Besides, {{what could}} have put the idea into her head? It was laughable, the {{presumption}} {{that she was a}} finished actress, capable of deceiving everyone about her. If she had had an inkling of the truth, Joan, with every nerve on the alert, almost hoping for it, would have detected it. She had talked with her alone the day <b>before</b> <b>she</b> had <b>left</b> England, and the woman had been full of hopes and projects for the future.|$|R
