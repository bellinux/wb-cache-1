Archaeologists used a {{magnetometer}} {{to locate the}} position of the forge in the original <b>blacksmith</b> shop, thus, the current shop shares an interior which is an exact replica of the original. The exterior of the building has the same dimensions as the original as well.|$|E

5|$|The {{suit was}} {{originally}} brought by John <b>Blacksmith</b> in 1846. Represented by lawyer John H. Martindale, <b>Blacksmith</b> sued Joseph Fellows and Robert Kendle, {{agents of the}} Land Company, for the torts of assault and battery and trespass, quare clausum fregit, with the sawmill as the locus in quo. Blacksmith's wife and Ely S. Parker (Blacksmith's successor as sachem of the Wolf Clan), together the administrators of Blacksmith's estate, succeeded <b>Blacksmith</b> as plaintiffs.|$|E
5|$|Telephone {{services}} reached Whitemore in 1918, initially {{with only}} three subscribers. Telephone switching was done at the post office. Whitemore {{was connected to the}} State's electricity system in 1929. The electricity was fed from the Hydro-Electric scheme and was connected to twelve buildings, in Whitemore and several nearby farms, by August of the same year. There may have been blacksmiths in Whitemore from the mid-19th century. A <b>blacksmith</b> established a shop on the main road in 1895 that was, by 1900, the only <b>blacksmith</b> in the area. Shaw Contracting's office is on the site of this former blacksmith's shop.|$|E

5|$|The Chant of Jimmie <b>Blacksmith</b> was not {{the only}} film in which Dodd {{appeared}} that addressed topical Indigenous issues of the day. A decade after Jimmie <b>Blacksmith,</b> Dodd performed in Ground Zero, again with Jack Thompson in one of the lead roles. This film is a thriller based on claims that Indigenous Australians were used as human guinea pigs in the British nuclear tests at Maralinga. The film uses as its context the McClelland Royal Commission, which was investigating radioactive contamination at the site. In the film, Dodd plays a minor character named Freddy Tjapaljarri.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeals {{held that}} <b>Blacksmith</b> could {{independently}} bring the claim for trespass, {{for which he}} need only show a right to possession. The Court of Appeals also held that Fellows' title was invalid, because the payment of compensation was a condition precedent. Welles, in dissent, agreed that <b>Blacksmith</b> could individually sue for trespass, but disagreed that the appraisal was a condition precedent; he would have reversed and granted a new trial, with costs. The Court of Appeals remanded back to the Supreme Court, after which a writ of error was granted by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|The oppressive {{taxes and}} brutal {{collection}} methods incite sporadic rebellions that are suppressed harshly. Süß {{goes so far}} as to destroy half of a blacksmith's house to prove his power to punish those who refuse to pay their taxes. When the <b>blacksmith</b> attacks Süß's coach with a sledgehammer, Süß has the <b>blacksmith</b> hanged on the grounds that an attack on the Duke's minister is tantamount to an attack on the Duke himself.|$|E
40|$|Background: It is {{important}} to understand what motivates workers {{and the extent to which}} the organization and other contextual variables satisfy them. The aim of the study was to determine factors of dissatisfaction resulting from the organizational culture among the <b>blacksmiths</b> involved in the surgical instrument industry. Materials and Methods: Fifty male surgical <b>blacksmiths</b> each of the skilled and unskilled groups of the forging section were selected. Organizational Role Stress Scale was used to measure the individuals′ role stress and several forms of conflict within an organization. Also, the organizational culture and personal involvement in an organization was measured among the surgical <b>blacksmiths.</b> Results: The mean score for total role stress for Skilled was 71. 7 and for unskilled was 77. 2. The most frequent type of organizational culture was reported to be hierarchy, both by skilled and unskilled surgical <b>blacksmiths,</b> followed by market and clan culture. Conclusion: This study shows that the skilled surgical <b>blacksmiths</b> have lower level of stress and conflicts in comparison with unskilled surgical <b>blacksmiths.</b> Both skilled and unskilled surgical <b>blacksmiths</b> estimated their level of personal involvement as low and indicated insufficient involvement in work teams. The satisfaction of the employees with their status and role in the organizational culture was also poor for both skilled and unskilled surgical <b>blacksmiths...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Some of the Zaghawa work as <b>blacksmiths</b> (as these {{craftsmen}} are collectively called). Their craft involves making metal tools, weapons, and jewelry; making pottery; and carving wooden stools {{and musical}} instruments. A {{few of the}} <b>blacksmiths</b> also tan hides, make various leather items, weave cotton, and hunt. In times past, the <b>blacksmiths</b> depended primarily on hunting for survival. However, since the introduction of firearms in the area, there is {{a limited amount of}} game in the region. Among the Zaghawa, <b>blacksmiths</b> are considered to be the lowest caste.|$|R
50|$|Because {{leaf springs}} {{are made of}} {{relatively}} high quality steel, they are a favorite material for <b>blacksmiths.</b> In countries such as Nepal, Bangladesh, the Philippines and Pakistan, where traditional <b>blacksmiths</b> still produce {{a large amount of}} the country's tools, leaf springs from scrapped cars are frequently used to make knives, kukris, and other tools. They are also commonly used by amateur and hobbyist <b>blacksmiths.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} <b>blacksmith</b> shop on {{the site}} is long gone, however, in 1962 an archaeological team made of students from the University of Illinois approached the Deere Company about excavating {{the site where the}} shop once stood. The team unearthed the location of the original Deere <b>Blacksmith</b> Shop where the first successful steel plow was developed in 1837. The dig site is preserved beneath a building, known as the pavilion. The site is surrounded by museum exhibits which include artifacts, news clippings, and photographs.|$|E

5|$|Zen-Yi recovers {{and joins}} Jack and the <b>blacksmith.</b> Meanwhile, Blossom offers to let Silver hide {{the gold in}} a secret tomb beneath the brothel in return for payment. The gold is stored in a coffin which is raised up to the rafters. That night, Blossom has her girls serve the Lions, and Silk serves Brass. At Blossom's signal, the girls use weapons hidden in their mouths to poison many of the Lions, and they join with Blossom as the Black Widows. When Silk tries to poison Brass, his skin protects him, and he beats and almost kills her. Zen-Yi, Jack, and the <b>blacksmith</b> arrive and join with the Black Widows to fight the {{remaining}} Lions while Blossom and Bronze fight and kill each other. While fighting Jack, Poison Dagger is crushed between large moving gears. Silver and Zen-Yi fight in the tomb; Zen-Yi cuts the coffin free, and it crushes Silver. The <b>blacksmith</b> finds Silk, who dies in his arms. He confronts Brass, and his iron fists prove capable of inflicting damage on Brass' seemingly invincible body. While Brass is in metal form, a powerful punch from the <b>blacksmith</b> shatters him to pieces. Jack runs outside in time to stop the soldiers from decimating the building with Gatling guns.|$|E
