40|$|This paper {{presents}} a traffic lights control prototype using wireless technologies, i. e., Arduino and XBee technologies, {{with at least}} 1 km range. The algorithm and the grid also allow flow of information between message boards and multiple wireless sensors networks in an interconnected system. The communication range between the points of interest can be changed according {{to the needs of}} each network, so that this prototype can be applied almost everywhere. The prototype in this paper allows great flexibility allowing the network to adapt to local failures or unforeseen cases. Even the control center can be moved to other place without large drawbacks, especially when compared to all the <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>cables</b> used in point to point connections...|$|E
40|$|Underground test {{sites for}} {{disposal}} of {{high-level radioactive waste}} (HLW) are commonly equipped with instrumentation for documentation {{of the evolution of}} engineered barriers and of changes in the physical state of the host rock. The rate of hydration of the clay buffer surrounding waste canisters determines the physical interaction with the rock and waste canisters and is recorded by use of RH meters and by measuring the swelling pressure exerted on cells installed in the clay. They are connected to cables and tubings extending to the recording units placed in room atmosphere. If they pass from the rock through the buffer groundwater under pressure can migrate through or along <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> <b>cables</b> and tubings and reach the points of measurement earlier than in clay without instrumentation. The inconvenience is avoided by tight embedment <b>of</b> individual <b>cables</b> and tubings and placement of the pressure gauges such that they do not pass through the clay. Incorrect rates of hydration has led to the inadequate conclusion that water flows in unsaturated parts of the buffer according Darcy’s law while it is in fact migrating by coupled diffusion processes.

40|$|We {{have applied}} a multiobjective {{combinatorial}} optimization (MOCO) {{based on a}} vector immune system (VIS) algorithm to determine the optimal sequence <b>of</b> parallel <b>cables</b> in a multiconductor three-phase system. We build the objective function {{in a way that}} minimizes the magnetic stray field and the current unbalance <b>of</b> a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> rectilinear power <b>cables.</b> Our principal aim is to extend and verify the ability of the VIS algorithm to solve combinatorial problems represented by nonlinear objectives that are not usually solved in MOCO problem...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the main}} issues afflicting the current M88A2 is {{the high rate of}} winch {{failures}}. The leading cause of these failures is by operating the winch without tension on the cable leading to loose wrapping and <b>bunching</b> up <b>of</b> the <b>cable</b> (Birdnesting). There is also concern with loss of tractive force when an M88A2 tows a heavy M1 Abrams on a slope in wet, muddy conditions. The M88A2 was extensively tested at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland and on August 10, 1998 was officially approved for the towing of 70-ton combat vehicles such as the M1 Abrams.|$|R

Your support means more than you know.What {{you are looking at}} is an 'official bootleg', {{recorded}} and presented to you by Hundred Reasons. It is not an all-singing, all-dancing big budget live album and will not be available over the counter in any shop. It is possible you will be the only person you know who owns this record.We recorded these songs on the road during March 2004. All it took was our own pro-tools recording rig, a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> dodgy <b>cables,</b> gaffa tape and some plastic sheeting. Brother Steve Gurney did the live sound (as he has for nearly four glorious years) and it was my job to sift through it all and do some rough mixes for this release, which I did in one day in our South London rehearsal room. That is all it took, I did not 'fix' anything using the wonders of modern technology. No drums were moved and no vocals were tuned which, believe me, is a rarity nowadays. What you hear is what you get. Enjoy...'''' ...|$|R

With {{the growing}} acceptance of multimedia and the Internet, mobile phones are becoming multi-purpose information appliances, incorporating everyday {{services such as}} telephone, fax, answering machine, television, chat, games, internet browsing, GPS navigation etc. These mobile devices can now replace {{the functions of the}} head mounted displays making augmented reality applications accessible to users on their mobile phone. Augmented Reality has started spreading among people with applications of games, sports, tourist places, shopping and even in viewing things which appear invisible in walls. There are number <b>of</b> electrical <b>cables,</b> water pipes, vents passing over, behind a wall. Sometimes when you need to set up new electrical cables or new water pipes connection inside your wall one needs to figure out the existing circuitry <b>of</b> <b>cables</b> and structure <b>of</b> water pipes before piercing a hole. At some places there are large <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> electrical <b>cables</b> running over while in some places there are number of water pipes there is no such standard for infrastructure of a building. It depends on area and usage number of things that are structure inside wall. One such example is complicated wire mesh in Boeing aircraft. The electrical assembly of aircraft is highly complex which thousands <b>of</b> <b>cables</b> running through it. Using the augmented reality technique, we can view the infrastructure inside wall for that particular wire which is in reality invisible as it hides behind the wall. This thesis shows how to integrate 3 -D virtual objects into a 3 -D real environment in real time. It describes the visualization and planning at different places in a home or offices or any places you may visit. We use Qualcomm's Augmented Reality SDK (QCAR) for a mobile device. In this method, we show that a number of 3 D virtual walls with a certain scale are stored as an Image Target in an application. The 3 D view shows wires, pipes, vents and other infrastructures inside the wall. Thus, we provide a very effective and intuitive way of "annotating" reality...|$|R
