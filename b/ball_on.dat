For example, a <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> the side line {{is still in the}} field of play; a <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> the line of the penalty circle is in the penalty circle; a foul committed over the 23-metre (25-yard) line has occurred in the 23-metre area. A ball must completely cross a boundary line to be out of play, and a ball must wholly cross the goal line before a goal is scored.|$|E

5|$|The Panhandles' opening {{game against}} the Dayton Triangles is {{considered}} to be the first football game between two APFA teams. The Panhandles lost 14–0 to the Triangles. Despite the first two quarters resulting in ties, the crowd was excited. In the second quarter, the Triangles made a goal line stand while the Panhandles had the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> the 3-yard line. Before halftime, the Triangles' Al Mahrt completed a 30-yard pass to Dutch Thiele, which resulted in the Triangles to having the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> the 5-yard line. The Triangles' did not score on that possession due to the clock running out.|$|E

5|$|The {{primary role}} of the halfback, {{also known as the}} tailback, is to carry the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> running plays. Halfbacks may also serve as receivers.

5|$|With 4:50 {{remaining}} on the clock, and the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> their own eight-yard line, Maryland drove 89yards to the Wolfpack three-yard line, which included a pass to Davin Meggett for 31yards. This set up a 20-yard field goal attempt by Obi Egekeze with eightseconds on the clock. The kick was good and put Maryland ahead for good, 27–24.|$|E
5|$|A minute later, West Ham {{went ahead}} again; defender Paul Konchesky {{received}} the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> the left flank, {{and played a}} ball into the Liverpool penalty area, only to see it sail over goalkeeper Reina and into the goal.

5|$|After {{receiving}} Louisville's kickoff, Virginia Tech {{elected to}} run out the clock and bring the first half to an end. During the process, Marcus Vick ran the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> a designed play and was tackled by Cardinals defensive end Elvis Dumervil after Vick gained nine yards. Following the play, Vick paused, then stomped on Dumervil's leg. Though referees failed to observe the stomp, television commentators replayed the action, and Tech coaches considered pulling Vick from the game as punishment. At {{the end of the}} first half of play, Louisville held a 17–10 lead.|$|E
5|$|Alabama stormed 80 {{yards and}} T. J. Yeldon {{extended}} the Alabama lead to 21–0 with his one-yard {{run on the}} first play of the second quarter. Notre Dame then responded with their longest play from scrimmage of the game on a 31-yard Everett Golson pass to DaVaris Daniels. However, the Irish then surrendered the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> downs when they failed to convert on fourth-and-five four plays later. Each team then traded punts {{over the next four}} possessions before the Crimson Tide scored their final points of the first half. With just 0:31 left in the quarter, McCarron threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Lacy that made the halftime score 28–0.|$|E

5|$|Apart from battling, {{capturing}} Pokémon is {{the most}} essential element of Pokémon gameplay. During battle with a wild Pokémon (other trainers' Pokémon cannot be captured), the player may use a Poké <b>Ball</b> <b>on</b> the wild Pokémon. If successful, the Pokémon {{will be added to}} the player's active party (or stored if the player already has the maximum six Pokémon in his/her party). Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP (and/or status effects such as Paralysis or Sleep,) of the target Pokémon and the strength of the Poké Ball used: the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture is.|$|E
5|$|As had Virginia Tech, Air Force {{began moving}} the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> the ground. The Falcons were aided by two offsides {{penalties}} against the Hokies and drove into Tech territory. Once there, Weiss completed a 16-yard pass to Tom Coleman {{for a first}} down. Weiss picked up another first down by running the ball, pushing the Falcons inside the Tech red zone with 10:10 remaining. The Tech defense stiffened, forcing a fourth down at the two-yard line. Rather than kick a field goal, Fisher DeBerry elected to attempt the touchdown, and Mike Brown ran the needed twoyards. The score and following extra point gave Air Force a 177 lead with 6:00 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} five games, the absence of Adrian Peterson did not keep the Sooners from running the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> the ground. Allen Patrick returned from missing {{the last two games}} with a sore ankle and put up 163yards on 23carries, including a 65-yard touchdown scamper to start the second half. Chris Brown had an additional 19carries for 74yards and two touchdowns as Patrick's backup.
