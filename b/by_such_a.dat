5|$|A severe depression, the Panic of 1873, {{began in}} the same year as passage of the act, and persisted for much of the decade. Many in the United States came to believe the gold {{standard}} too rigid to deal with economic hard times like those, and sought to restore bimetallism. The inflation caused <b>by</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> policy would enable debtors to repay what they owed more easily. The price of silver continued to fall—the silver in a dollar in the new metric-weight subsidiary silver coins was worth only $.75 by mid-1876, though the price recovered some after that.|$|E
5|$|Over the Rainbow {{received}} poor reviews. Though praising Talbot's voice, critics noted a lack {{of depth}} in the performances, and questioned the appropriateness of releasing and rating work <b>by</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> young artist. The album peaked at number 35 on the UK Albums Chart. Despite its poor chart performance, additional copies of the album had to be pressed after sales were higher than expected. Talbot later toured Asia {{in support of the}} album; Over the Rainbow achieved more success on Asian charts, reaching number one in Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong.|$|E

The living beings hurt <b>by</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> man {{take the form of}} savage serpent-like beasts called rurus and torture this person.

5|$|Following {{his four}} {{consecutive}} championships with Simeon, Parker (and Chicago's Simeon) {{were compared to}} McClain (and Peoria's Manual). Peoria's Journal Star emphasized that McClain was 32–0 as a starter in IHSA play because in the 1994–97 time period the IHSA was only divided into two classes. Thus, Manual had to wade through an 8-round tournament instead of the 7-round modern 4-class format. However, Simeon won 6 of its 7 games in its final championship by more than 10 points, while Manual only won 3 of its 8 <b>by</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> margin. In the postgame press conference, Simeon Coach Smith emphasized that his team had to endure the pressure of playing a national schedule that included games against elite teams in distant venues. Note, that with the 4-class system rather than the 2-class system of the past, the 2013 Class 3A IHSA champion was CPL runner-up Morgan Park, who split 2 neutral court 2013 games with Simeon. As noted above, Rose-era Simeon teams only won 2 championships in the 2-class era. Adding Parker's 55-11 start to a 33–1 junior year and a 30–3 senior season gives him a 118–15 legacy compared to Rose's 120–12.|$|E
5|$|Following {{their long}} delay, Babayane, Mshete, Maund and Colenbrander journeyed to England aboard the Moor. They disembarked at Southampton in early March 1889, and {{travelled}} by train to London, where they {{checked into the}} Berners Hotel on Oxford Street. They were invited to Windsor Castle after two days in the capital. The audience was originally meant only for the two izinDuna and their interpreter—Maund could not attend such a meeting as he was a British subject—but Knutsford arranged an exception for Maund when Babayane and Mshete refused to go without him; the Colonial Secretary {{said that it would}} be regrettable for all concerned if the embassy were derailed <b>by</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> technicality. The emissaries duly met the Queen and delivered the letter from Lobengula, as well as an oral message they had been told to pass on.|$|E

She planned to take Daugavpils, but after a reconnaissance mission discovered {{that the city was}} defended by a strong garrison and was impregnable to attack <b>by</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> small force as her own unit, that plan was abandoned. She then returned to Samogitia and headed for Panevėžys, where on 30 April she joined forces with the unit commanded by Karol Załuski. On May 4, she fought at the battle of Prastavoniai; shortly afterwards, with Konstanty Parczewski, she fought at Maišiagala. On 5 May, she witnessed General Dezydery Chłapowski entering the area with a large force and taking command over all units fighting in the former Grand Duchy.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, Arsenal {{suffered}} their heaviest league {{defeat in}} 84 years as they lost 8–2 to Manchester United at Old Trafford. Arsenal had not lost a league game <b>by</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> margin since 1927 when they lost 7–0 to West Ham United {{in the old}} Football League First Division. This {{was also the first}} time they had conceded eight goals in a game since 1896, when they lost 8–0 to the now defunct Loughborough in the old Football League Second Division. A year later, striker Robin van Persie joined United, having stated that he would not renew his contract with Arsenal. It was speculated that he would move to a club overseas, but signed for the Manchester club, the first Arsenal player to do so since Viv Anderson in 1987. Ferguson called Wenger to push through a deal when he learnt of the contract situation. Van Persie was instrumental in United's league win of 2012–13 – Ferguson's last, and coincidentally received a guard of honour by his former teammates before United faced Arsenal at the Emirates in April 2013.|$|E
5|$|Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was {{appointed}} as his replacement, initially {{on a temporary}} basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot {{on the final day}} of the season. Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Antić, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Antić's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable <b>by</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.|$|E

5|$|Several months previously, Texians {{had driven}} all Mexican {{troops out of}} Mexican Texas. About 100Texians were then garrisoned at the Alamo. The Texian force grew {{slightly}} {{with the arrival of}} reinforcements led by eventual Alamo co-commanders James Bowie and William B. Travis. On February 23, approximately 1,500 Mexicans marched into San Antonio de Béxar as {{the first step in a}} campaign to retake Texas. For the next 10 days, the two armies engaged in several skirmishes with minimal casualties.

5|$|To {{achieve that}} result, Varrick takes care {{to prevent the}} case from going to Florida, Alisandros' {{favorite}} battleground. It is much better for them to let jurisdiction be claimed by Chicago federal judge Harry Seawright, with whom Rogan Rothberg has some ties. A bonus from Varrick's {{point of view is}} the fact that the Chicago tort lawsuit was filed <b>by</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> minor and inexperienced firm as Finley & Figg; it is confidently assumed that Karros would make short work of them in court. The case is soon expedited on Seawright's docket with Finley & Figg's claim singled out of the tort claimants and Karros takes action to have Finley & Figg's eight death cases heard separately. The specific case singled out to serve as the test case is one in which Finley & Figg represents the widow of a man who died after taking Krayoxx but he was also taking prior to his death a mixture of some ten other drugs, so that it is virtually impossible to pinpoint the effect of Krayoxx.|$|E
5|$|The departures of Núñez and Van Gaal {{were hardly}} noticed by the fans when {{compared}} to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season. Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot {{on the final day of}} the season. Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager.
