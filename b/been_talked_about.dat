25|$|By {{the late}} 1970s The Etobicoke Board of Education {{had gone through}} the process of closing over thirty schools because of a {{dramatic}} decline in enrolment, which dropped from 65,000 to fewer than 35,000 pupils. In spite of this, the senior staff felt compelled to resume innovative programs that had characterized the Board during the 1960s and 1970s. One idea had <b>been</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> in the program department was a school for artistic students.|$|E
25|$|The {{novel was}} made into the film Lady in the Lake, {{starring}} and directed by Robert Montgomery. Montgomery tried a technique that had often <b>been</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> in Hollywood but never used in a major film: he used the camera as the protagonist (Philip Marlowe) of the film. Other characters talk directly to the camera. The voice of Marlowe is that of Montgomery, but his face is shown only in reflections. Reviews of the film were not appreciative of the new approach. Most critics gave the director credit for trying an experimental technique but felt the experiment had been a failure.|$|E

25|$|A {{requirement}} of the course was that each student had to produce a thesis for graduation: Whittle decided to write his on potential aircraft design developments, notably flight at high altitudes and speeds over 500mph (800km/h). In Future Developments in Aircraft Design he showed that incremental improvements in existing propeller engines were unlikely to make such flight routine. Instead he described what is today {{referred to as a}} motorjet; a motor using a conventional piston engine to provide compressed air to a combustion chamber whose exhaust was used directly for thrust – essentially an afterburner attached to a propeller engine. The idea was not new and had <b>been</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> for some time in the industry, but Whittle's aim was to demonstrate that at increased altitudes the lower outside air pressure would increase the design's efficiency. For long-range flight, using an Atlantic-crossing mailplane as his example, the engine would spend most of its time at high altitude and thus could outperform a conventional powerplant.|$|E

In 2006, Mudvayne did not have any plans to tour and were taking most of the summer and fall off, while Nothingface was preparing to record their next album. The time over the summer allowed the band to pursue the project which had <b>been</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> for years.|$|E
500|$|Fischer {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} play in the Third Lessing J. Rosenwald Trophy Tournament in New York City (1956), a premier tournament limited to the 12 players considered the best in the country. Although Fischer's rating was not among the top 12 in the country, he received entry by special consideration. Playing against top opposition, the 13-year-old Fischer could only score 4½/11, tying for 8–9th place. Yet, he won the [...] for his immortal game against International Master Donald Byrne, in which Fischer sacrificed his queen to unleash an unstoppable attack. Hans Kmoch called it [...] "The Game of the Century", writing: [...] "The following game, a stunning masterpiece of [...] play performed by a boy of 13 against a formidable opponent, matches the finest on record in the history of chess prodigies". According to Frank Brady, The Game of the Century' has <b>been</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about,</b> analyzed, and admired for more than fifty years, and it will probably {{be a part of the}} canon of chess for many years to come." [...] "In reflecting on his game a while after it occurred, Bobby was refreshingly modest: 'I just made the moves I thought were best. I was just lucky.|$|E

[...] Although a Hobart nomination had <b>been</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> at least since Griggs' victory the previous November, Hobart expressed reluctance {{in a letter to}} his wife from the convention: [...] "It looks to me I will be nominated for Vice-President whether I want it or not, and as I get nearer to the point where I may, I am dismayed at the thought... If I want a nomination, everything is going my way. But when I realize all that it means in work, worry, and loss of home and bliss, I am overcome, so overcome I am simply miserable." [...] Despite Hobart's expressed hesitation, he was welcomed home by a crowd of 15,000 at the Paterson Armory. [...] City officials, feeling they had insufficient fireworks to properly honor Hobart, obtained more from New York City.|$|E
500|$|Stengel had <b>been</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> as a {{possible}} Yankee manager in the early 1940s, but longtime team boss Ed Barrow [...] (who retired in 1945) refused to consider it. Yankee manager Joe McCarthy retired during the 1946 season, and after the interim appointment of catcher Bill Dickey as player-manager, Bucky Harris was given the job in 1947. Stengel's name was mentioned for the job before Harris got it; he was backed by Weiss, but Lee MacPhail, then {{in charge of the}} franchise, was opposed. Harris and the Yankees won the World Series that year, but finished third in 1948, though they were not eliminated until the penultimate day. Harris was fired, allegedly because he would not give Weiss his home telephone number. MacPhail could no longer block Stengel's hiring, as he had sold his interest in the Yankees after the 1947 season. Weiss, by then team [...] general manager, urged his partners in the Yankees to allow the appointment of Stengel, who aided his own cause by winning the championship with Oakland during the time the Yankee job stood open. Del Webb, who owned part of the Yankees, had initial concerns but went along. Yankee scouts on the West Coast recommended Stengel, and Webb's support helped bring around co-owner Dan Topping.|$|E
2500|$|On June 29, 2000, Blizzard {{launched}} {{the second game}} of the Diablo series, Diablo II. In 2001, Uelmen, who composed the Diablo II Soundtrack, and cinematic soundtrack composers Jason Hayes, Glenn Stafford and Andrea Pessino won the International Game Developers Association award for Excellence in Audio for their work on Diablo II. Continuing {{his work in the}} Diablo series, on June 29, 2001, Blizzard launched what would be believed to be the last game of the series, the expansion pack [...] In an interview with Gamasutra, Uelmen was asked about his time at Blizzard between 2001 and 2005. When asked whether he had worked on the earlier version of Diablo III prior to the shutdown of Blizzard North, he responded, [...] "I guess at this point I can say, yes, more or less.

2500|$|On 13 May Powell {{said the}} task force was sent [...] "to repossess the Falkland Islands, to restore British {{administration}} of the islands {{and to ensure that}} the decisive factor in the future of the islands should be the wishes of the inhabitants" [...] but the Foreign Secretary (Francis Pym) desired an [...] "interim agreement": [...] "So far as I understand that interim agreement, it is in breach, if not in contradiction, of each of the three objects with which {{the task force}} was dispatched to the South Atlantic. There was to be a complete and supervised withdrawal of Argentine forces... matched by corresponding withdrawal of British forces. There is no withdrawal of British force that 'corresponds' to the withdrawal from the territory of the islands of those who have unlawfully occupied them. We {{have a right to be}} there; those are our waters, the territory is ours and we have the right to sail the oceans with our fleets whenever we think fit. So the whole notion of a 'corresponding withdrawal', a withdrawal of the only force which can possibly restore the position, which can possibly ensure any of the objectives which have <b>been</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> on either side of the House, is in contradiction of the determination to repossess the Falklands".|$|E
2500|$|Reston {{was planned}} before the term [...] "new urbanism" [...] entered into {{mainstream}} use, but it follows new urbanism guidelines {{in a number}} of ways. Reston was built with an extensive path system, and recently Fairfax County has constructed many sidewalks. It is possible to bike to downtown Reston in 15 minutes from most locations. The downtown and original areas also incorporate mixed-use development. Further mixed-use development is planned for areas where Washington Metro stations are or will be located. However, Reston differs from New Urbanism principles in several important ways. Almost all buildings are oriented away from main streets, and few major arteries have complete sidewalk networks, although pedestrian and bike travel is easily accomplished on the isolated nature paths referred to above. This is a result of Fairfax County controlling Reston's transportation planning—until recently, the Fairfax County zoning code only required sidewalks to be built by developers in certain cases. The inward orientation of buildings was a preference of the early developers of Reston, who wished to avoid the commercial strip look that dominates many suburban developments in favor of a more naturalistic look. In addition, the Dulles Toll Road Corridor of office parks cuts a half-mile wide swath across the community, with only five north-south connections, making cross-town travel by car and foot difficult. The creation of a sixth connection at Soapstone Drive has <b>been</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> in the past by planners, and the creation of mixed-use developments around planned Metro Stations may help better knit the community together.|$|E
