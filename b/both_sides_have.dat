5|$|Warcraft: Orcs & Humans is a {{real-time}} strategy game (RTS). The player {{takes the}} role of either the Human inhabitants of Azeroth, or the invading Orcs. In the single player campaign mode the player works {{through a series of}} missions, the objective of which varies, but usually involves building a small town, harvesting resources, building an army and then leading it to victory. In multiplayer games, the objective is always to destroy the enemy players' forces. Some scenarios are complicated by the presence of wild monsters, but sometimes these monsters can be used as troops. The game plays in a medieval setting with fantasy elements. <b>Both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> melee units and ranged units, and also spellcasters.|$|E
5|$|A Test {{match is}} won when one side has scored more runs {{than the total}} runs scored by the {{opposing}} side during their two innings. If <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> completed both their allocated innings and the side that fielded last has the higher aggregate of runs, it {{is known as a}} win by runs. This indicates the number of runs that they had scored more than the opposing side. If one side scores more runs in a single innings than the total runs scored by the other side in both their innings, it is known as a win by innings and runs. If the side batting last wins the match, it is known as a win by wickets, indicating the number of wickets that were still to fall.|$|E

5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Millwall and West Ham United {{is one of}} the longest-standing and most bitter in English football. The two teams, then known as Millwall Athletic and Thames Ironworks, both {{originated}} in the East End of London, and were located under three miles apart. They first played each other in the 1899–1900 FA Cup. The match was historically known as the Dockers derby, as both sets of supporters were predominantly dockers at shipyards {{on either side of the}} River Thames. Consequently, each set of fans worked for rival firms who were competing for the same business; this intensified the tension between the teams. In 1910, Millwall moved south of the River Thames to New Cross and the teams were no longer East London neighbours. <b>Both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> relocated since, but remain just under four miles apart. Millwall moved to The Den in Bermondsey in 1993 and West Ham to the London Stadium in Stratford in 2016.|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} types of {{units in the}} game. Each unit has a set of {{statistics}} which is displayed in the interface once selected. The statistics range from combat strength, fatigue, efficiency, supply and movement points. During the game, <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> the option to request air support {{that can be used}} to attack enemy units. If the other side uses their air support, the player will be given a warning of an oncoming air strike and will have the option to retreat. The game has two endings depending on the side chosen. If playing as NATO, the main objective is to stall Soviet forces long enough until American reinforcements arrive. However, if playing as the Warsaw Pact, the objective is to destroy all NATO forces.|$|E
25|$|Later that year, a 12–16 month {{investigation}} began that {{is expected}} to last until sometime between September 2016 to January 2017. Thus far, <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> provided well over 100,000 documents.|$|E

The negotiations began in early August and concluded on December 24, when a final agreement was signed; <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>had</b> to ratify {{it before it}} could take effect.

25|$|Warcraft II is a {{real-time}} strategy game.

25|$|For {{the period}} from 1994 to 2003, {{estimates}} ranged from 50,000 to 250,000 civilians and 10,000 to 50,000 Russian servicemen killed. Given that almost certainly <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> tended to exaggerate enemy military casualties while minimizing their own and grossly underestimating its responsibility for civilian losses, the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society set the conservative estimate of death toll in this time period at about 150,000 - 200,000 civilians, 20,000 to 40,000 Russian soldiers, and possibly {{the same amount of}} Chechen rebels.|$|E
25|$|The {{possibility}} of war, the close geographical proximity of ROC-controlled Taiwan and PRC-controlled mainland China, {{and the resulting}} flare-ups that occur every few years, conspire to make {{this one of the}} most watched focal points in the Pacific. <b>Both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> chosen to have a strong naval presence. However, naval strategies between both powers greatly shifted in the 1980s and 1990s, while the ROC assumed a more defensive attitude by building and buying frigates and missile destroyers, and the PRC a more aggressive posture by developing long-range cruise missiles and supersonic surface-to-surface missiles.|$|E

25|$|Lake Sava (Serbian: Савско језеро, Savsko jezero), often also {{referred}} to as Ada, was created from the right arm of the Sava with the building of two dams near the northern and southern tips of the island in 1967. The lake is 4.2km long, has an average width of 200 m and is 4 to 6 m deep. It covers and area of 0.8km2 and is 78 m above sea level, one of the lowest areas of Belgrade. 7km of its shores on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> been transformed into a gravel beach. The water regularly reaches 24°C during summer.|$|E
25|$|Normal swing occurs mostly {{when the}} ball is fairly new. As it wears more, the {{aerodynamics}} of the asymmetry change and {{it is more difficult}} to extract a large amount of swing. When the ball becomes very old—around 40 or more overs old—it begins to swing towards the shine. This is known as reverse swing—meaning a natural outswinger will become an inswinger and vice versa. In essence, <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> turbulent flow, but here the seam causes the airflow to separate earlier on one side. The result is always a swing to the side with the later separation, so the swing is away from the seam.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} {{meetings}} were held between the SEF and the ARATS at Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing from 11 June 2008 to 14 June 2008. By convention, SEF–ARATS negotiations proceed in three rounds: a technical round led by negotiators seconded from the relevant government departments, a draft round led by deputy heads of the two organisations, and a formal round led by {{the heads of the}} two organisations. In this case, however, <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> already reached broad consensus on these issues on both the technical and political levels through previous negotiations via the non-governmental and inter-party channels. As a result, the initial technical round was dispensed with, and the negotiations began with the second, draft round.|$|E

Little action followed before the break, but Parma were awarded a penalty after 73 minutes when Jonathan was tripped in the area; Sergio Floccari converted the penalty.
