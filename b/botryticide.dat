40|$|Grey mould {{caused by}} the fungus Botrytis cinerea is a common disease on several kinds of {{ripening}} fruits, including grape. In addition to quantitative losses, if strongly affected grapes are processed into wine the enzymatic activity of the fungus can {{have a negative effect}} on the wine quality. Epidemics are usually initiated in Spring from inoculum produced on different overwintering structures. Leaf infections and, with higher impact, floral infections can generate fruit infections through different infection pathways, some of which include a degree of symptomless latency. Not only environmental conditions but also bunch architecture and berry structure can influence disease severity and incidence: grape varieties with compact clusters are more susceptible to the disease. Traditionally, the control of B. cinerea in the vineyard is performed using synthetic fungicides: up to three applications per season, depending on the production line, the weather conditions and the risk a grower wants to take. Within the FP 7 -KBBE project "Pesticide Use-and-risk Reduction in European farming systems with Integrated Pest Management" (PURE) two different strategies were tested to reduce the use of synthetic fungicides against B. cinerea in viticulture: i) create a microclimate less favourable to the pathogen, and ii) use of Biological Control Agents (BCAs). The first strategy was tested at the Julius Kühn-Institute in Siebeldingen (Germany) in the grape growing seasons 2011 and 2012. Manual defoliation of the berry zone was performed before and after flowering to modify the bunch structure of compact varieties and at veraison to enhance ventilation of the berry zone during ripening. Defoliation was compared with one, two and three synthetic fungicides applications. In 2011, with high disease pressure, the defoliation at flowering was as effective as three <b>botryticide</b> treatments, while in 2012 disease pressure was too low to check differences between defoliation and fungicides. In the second strategy, three different BCAs were applied alone or in combination in 3 vineyards located in different geographical areas of Italy. Bacillus subtilis, Aureobasidium pullulans and Trichoderma atroviride were applied at four critical stages for infection: i) before bunch closure, ii) at veraison, iii) 20 days before harvest, and iv) 3 - 7 days before harvest. In the trials carried out in central Italy, both disease incidence and severity were low (disease severity from 8. 9 to 14. 6) and all treatments gave a good control of the disease in both years, even when applied alone. In the Po Valley vineyard (northern Italy) disease pressure was low in 2011 and nil in 2012; nonetheless, in 2011 bunches treated with the different BCAs were less affected than the untreated ones. The tested BCAs appeared very promising, especially when applied at the right phenological stages of the vines and under a moderate disease pressure. Further data are necessary to confirm these results with higher disease pressure. Combing the use of defoliation and BCAs with models able to predict both the phenological stage of the plants and the risk of infection would lead to optimize the control of bunch rot in grap...|$|E

By evaluation of the intensity of B. cinerea infection on the Graševina and Traminac grapes the strongest infection determined on the control, and the weakest on the variant with <b>botryticides</b> Switch. Comparison of infection intensity on the Traminac grapes with the Graševina grapes led to no differences concerning the sensitivity of varieties.

40|$|Chemical control {{remains the}} easiest way to manage Botrytis {{epidemics}} on many crops. Nevertheless, actual concerns about the environment, human health and control sustainability invite to a smarter use of fungicides, aiming to delay resistance evolution in pathogen populations. This chapter deals with the mode of action of <b>botryticides</b> (including multi-site toxicants and molecules affecting specifically respiration, cytoskeleton, osmoregulation, sterol and amino-acid biosynthesis) and associated resistance cases, mostly due to target site modifications. We also present original resistance mechanisms for fungi such as detoxification and multidrug resistance.

40|$|Three Botrytis cinerea populations, {{isolated}} from three vineyards, one untreated and two treated twice a year, respectively, with fenhexamid or cyprodinil+fludioxonil, were investigated {{to evaluate the}} effect of repeated fungicide treatments on the presence and distribution of the transposons Boty and Flipper, and on the phenotypic traits of each pathogen community. The vacuma individuals lacking the two transposons represented {{the majority of the}} 390 B. cinerea isolates followed by transposa strains containing Boty and Flipper, while the remaining 67 isolates harboured respectively only Boty (60) or Flipper (7). This research has demonstrated that fungicide application did not influence the transposon distribution patterns, the sensitivity towards various <b>botryticides,</b> or the growth rate of the isolates belonging to the three different populations, but did induced overall reduction of the population size and selected isolates characterized by an enhanced pathogenicity, especially on Vitis vinifera leaves...|$|R
40|$|Several {{commercial}} vineyards, {{located in}} Piedmont (Northern Italy), were monitored {{in order to}} evaluate the sensitivity of Botrytis cinerea Pers., the causal agent of grey mould, to five classes of botryticides: benzimidazoles, dicarboximides, phenylcarbamates, anilinopyrimidines and phenylpyrroles. Strains of B. cinerea resistant to anilinopyrimidines were easily detected, particularly in 1999, a year characterized by high disease pressure, even in vineyards not sprayed with that class of fungicides. Fludioxonil-resistance, on the contrary, was not detected. Resistance to benzimidazoles and dicarboximides was at previous observed levels. For the first time, resistance to phenylcarbamates was detected in the field. Strains of B. cinerea showing multiple resistance to benzimidazoles, dicarboximides and anilinopyrimidines and maintaining a good level of virulence, as shown by tests carried out on wounded apples, are present in Italian vineyards.

40|$|Botrytis cinerea is {{a fungus}} that causes gray mold on many fruit crops. Despite the {{availability}} {{of a large number of}} <b>botryticides,</b> the chemical control of gray mold has been hindered by the emergence of resistant strains. In this paper, tests were done to determine the botryticidal efficacy of selected plant extracts alone or combined with kresoxim-methyl. In total, eight South African medicinal plants viz Artemisia afra, Elyptropappus rhinocerotis, Galenia africana, Hypoxis hemerocallidea, Siphonochilus aetheopicus, Sutherlandia frutescens, Tulbaghia violacea and Tulbaghia alliacea were screened. Allium sativum, a plant species known to have antifungal activity, was included in the in vivo studies. For the in vitro studies, synergistic interactions between the plant extracts and the kresoxim-methyl fungicide were tested with radial growth assays. Data indicated synergistic inhibitory effects between the fungicide and the plant extracts. Next, different doses of plant extracts combined with kresoxim-methyl were used for decay inhibition studies on Granny Smith apples. Synergistic and additive effects were observed for many of the combinations. Even though this study was done using only one strain of B. cinerea, results showed that the tested indigenous South African plant species possess natural compounds that potentiate the activity of kresoxim-methyl...|$|R
40|$|In vitro fungitoxicity {{tests with}} 14 sterol {{biosynthesis}} inhibitors (SBIs) {{showed that the}} SBIs pyrifenox, flusilazol, propiconazole, triflumizole and fenpropimorph applied at the low concentration of 1 µg ml- 1 inhibited the mycelial growth of wild-type and mutant strains of Botrytis cinerea that were resistant to the benzimidazoles, to the dicarboximides and to a mixture of benzimidazole+phenylcarbamate (carbendazim+diethofencarb). The SBIs tested exhibited higher effectiveness against the wild-type and mutant strains of B. cinerea compared with some widely used <b>botryticides,</b> such as the dicarboximides iprodione, procymidone and chlozolinate, the aromatic hydrocarbons quintozene, chloroneb and tolclofos-methyl, and the relatively new fungicides cyprodinil and fenhexamid. Only benomyl and fludioxonil presented higher effectiveness than the SBIs. In planta pot experiments with preventive applications of the commercial products Dorado 20 EC (pyrifenox), Punch 40 EC (flusilazol), Tilt 25 EC (propiconazole), Corbel 75 EC (fenpropimorph) and Trifmine 30 EC (triflumizole) showed that lesions of cucumber seedlings by all the abovementioned strains of B. cinerea were completely inhibited at low SBI concentrations of 0. 05 – 0. 1 g a. i. l- 1. After chemical mutagenesis with N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), only strains with low resistance (Rf 6 – 9, based on MIC values) to triadimefon were isolated at a mutation frequency of 3. 9 10 - 5. Cross-resistance studies with other SBIs showed that these triadimefon-resistant strains exhibited positive cross-resistance (Rf 2 – 10) to the other C- 14 demethylase inhibitors (DMIs), {{but not to the}} morpholine fungicides fenpropimorph or tridemorph. Study of fitness of DMI-resistant strains showed that these mutation(s) were pleiotropic, with significant adverse effects on characteristics determining phytopathogenic fitness such as rate of mycelial growth, sporulation, conidial germination and pathogenicity on cucumber seedlings.

40|$|Botrytis cinerea, is {{a high-risk}} {{pathogen}} for fungicide resistance development. Pathogen` resistance to SDHIs {{is associated with}} several mutations in sdh gene. The diversity of mutations and their differential effect on cross-resistance patterns among SDHIs and the fitness of resistant strains necessitate {{the availability of a}} tool for their rapid identification. This study was initiated to develop and validate a high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis for the identification of P 225 H/F/L//T, N 230 I and H 272 L/R/Y mutations. Based on the sequence of sdhB subunit of resistant and sensitive isolates, a universal primer pair was designed. The specificity of the HRM analysis primers was verified to ensure against the cross-reaction with other fungal species and its sensitivity was evaluated using concentrations of known amounts of mutant`s DNA. The melting curve analysis generated nine distinct curve profiles, enabling the discrimination of all the 4 mutations located at codon 225, the N 230 I mutation, the 3 mutations located in codon 272 and the non mutated isolates (isolates of wild type sensitivity). Similar results were obtained when DNA was extracted directly from artificially inoculated strawberry fruit. The method was validated by monitoring the presence of sdhB mutations in samples of naturally infected strawberry fruits and stone fruit rootstock seedling plants showing damping off symptoms. HRM analysis data were compared with a standard PIRA-PCR technique and an absolute agreement was observed suggesting that in both populations the H 272 R mutation was the predominant one, while H 272 Y, N 230 I and P 225 H were detected in lower frequencies. The results of the study suggest that HRM analysis can be a useful tool for sensate, accurate and rapid identification of several sdhB mutations in B. cinerea and it is expected to contribute in routine fungicide resistance monitoring or assessments of the effectiveness of antiresistance strategies implemented in crops heavily treated with <b>botryticides...</b>|$|R
40|$|During 2001 / 2002 {{experiments}} made in {{the vineyards}} of Kutjevo, the examinations were conducted on the intensity of infection with Botrytis cinerea Pers., {{the efficiency of the}} applied <b>botryticides,</b> the achieved grape production and the impact of meteorological factors on the development and intensity of the disease. Among the examined sorts of Graševina and Traminac, the intensity of infection with Botrytis in both years and on all localities was the highest on the control fields, which therefore indicate justified and appropriate use of fungicides. The examined efficiency of fungicides applied throughout all four phenophases of the vine development indicates the differences in their efficiency according to sorts and localities as well as the length of examination. With the sort Traminac the best efficiency was achieved with the Switch 62, 5 WG, somewhat weaker efficiency with the Mythos SC, and in the last place is the Kidan SC. As for the sort Graševina, the best efficiency was achieved with the Teldor SC, insignificantly weaker efficiency with the Switch 62, 5 WG, and last place is the combination of Folicur EW 50 + Euparen 50 WP. The production of grape achieved in the years of examination on certain localities did not show the expected results, since the unfavourable climatic conditions (too much humidity) in both years caused the extraordinary attack of the grey mould of grapes. The lowest production was achieved on the control fields with Traminac as well as with Graševina, whereas a better production was achieved with the sorts treated with fungicides, according to their efficiency. There is a significant impact of climatic factors (precipitation and temperatures) on the intensity of infection, the efficiency of fungicides and achieved production of grape. Both years of the examination in the months of grape ripening abounded in great amounts of rain. In 2001 the six-month average (V-X month) of the total quantity of rain was 504, 4 mm, and in 2002 531, 5 mm. Such a considerable amount of humidity in vineyards and the proportional variety of temperatures represent the perfect conditions for the development of Botrytis. The stated results indicate that the use of fungicides in the prevention of grey mould of grapes represents an indispensable protection measure aiming to achieve high production of quality and healthy grapes...|$|R
40|$|Two {{preliminary}} {{biological control}} screens were developed, using lettuce & strawberry as model systems, to test potential biocontrol micro-organisms {{for their ability}} to control Botrytis cinerea, the causal agent of grey mould. The first screen evaluated a range of saprophytic yeasts, bacteria & fungi {{for their ability to}} inhibit Botrytis lesions on whole lettuce plants. In a controlled environment (18 - 22 °C, 85 - 90 % relative humidity & 12 h photoperiod), lettuce leaves were spray inoculated with antagonists (10 ⁷ fungal spores mL⁻¹ or 10 ⁸ bacterial cells mL⁻¹), allowed to dry & challenged by spray inoculation with the pathogen (10 ⁶ conidia mL⁻¹). After 7 days Pseudomonas fluorescens LU 1001 & LU 1003, P. synxantha LU 1004 & P. veronii LU 1002 had significantly reduced lesion areas by an average of 79 % on whole lettuce plants. An Ulocladium sp. LU 865 & Epicoccum purpurascens LU 148 reduced lesion areas by 94 % & 78 %, respectively. The second screen evaluated selected saprophytic bacteria & filamentous fungi, with previously identified antagonistic properties (against a range of plant pathogens), for the ability to inhibit B. cinerea on detached strawberry tissues & whole strawberry plants. The most successful isolates, E. purpurascens LU 148 & Trichoderma atroviride LU 132, inhibited lesion development by up to 32 % & suppressed sporulation on detached strawberry leaves by up to 87 %. They were further evaluated on detached strawberry flowers & whole strawberry plants in a controlled environment (18 °C & 85 - 95 % relative humidity). The most consistently effective antagonist was T. atroviride LU 132, which inhibited B. cinerea in all experiments, significantly (P≤ 0. 05) suppressing B. cinerea sporulation on detached strawberry flowers & leaf discs removed from inoculated whole plants by 100 % & 81 %, respectively. This was similar to the level of disease suppression given by the commercial biocontrol product, Prestop & the fungicide, fenhexamid. The mechanism of action of T. atroviride LU 132 was investigated. Competition for glucose & sucrose occurred on detached strawberry leaf pieces & on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membranes, significantly inhibiting B. cinerea germ tube length at low sugar concentrations. The isolate also produced non-volatile inhibitory substances in minimal medium that inhibited B. cinerea germ tube elongation & in dual culture, T. atroviride LU 132 was found to directly parasitize B. cinerea hyphae leading to cell collapse. The biological activity of T. atroviride LU 132 against the grey mould pathogen was investigated on three cultivars of strawberry under field conditions. The study also examined the effect of commonly used <b>botryticides</b> on germination & growth of T. atroviride LU 132 to allow selection of a fungicide for mixed application. The fungicide fenhexamid significantly increased conidial germination frequency by up to 34 % & was later used in mixed tank applications. The field trials demonstrated that treatment with T. atroviride LU 132, fenhexamid, & the tank-mix of both could all equally suppress B. cinerea sporulation, significantly, on strawberry leaves & stamens by 42 - 100 %. These treatments increased yield of strawberry fruit by up to 36 % but they did not reduce disease incidence in the fruit in a 7 day ambient storage trial. This research has identified T. atroviride LU 132 as a successful biological control agent (BCA) of B. cinerea in strawberry. The more obvious mechanisms of action such as antibiosis, competition for nutrients & mycoparasitism have been investigated & the use of the BCA within an integrated management strategy, with the fungicide fenhexamid, has been successfully implemented. Future work will focus on developing a suitable formulation for the BCA in order to increase its efficacy under field conditions...|$|R
40|$|ATP-binding {{cassette}} (ABC) {{and major}} facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters {{are two major}} classes of proteins involved in drug resistance. ABC transporter proteins are primary transporters that use the energy generated by ATP hydrolysis to transport drugs over membranes, while MFS transport proteins are secondary transporters that use the proton motive force as an energy source. The substrate range of both transporters is very broad and may include ions, amino acids, peptides, sugars, secondary metabolites, and drugs. The goal of this thesis was to identify ABC and MFS transporter genes from Botrytis cinerea, which are involved in transport of sterol demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides, and to discover compounds, which can modulate the activity of such transporters. Such modulators {{may be useful in}} practice to counteract resistance development to DMIs. An overview of characteristics of B. cinerea, commercial fungicides used in control of the pathogen, modes of action of <b>botryticides,</b> and resistance development to fungicides that inhibit sterol biosynthesis is described in Chapter 1. This chapter also describes the relevance of ABC and MFS transporters in fungicide resistance and the importance of fungicide mixtures to delay resistance development. The DMI fungicide oxpoconazole, developed by Ube industries, Ltd., is introduced in Chapter 2. This fungicide is effective against diseases that are commonly controlled by DMIs, such as rusts and scabs. In addition, it is effective against grey mould caused by B. cinerea under field condition. B. cinerea is known for its ability to acquire resistance to fungicides easily. ABC and MFS transporters {{may play a role in}} such a resistance development. The physiological functions of these transporters may be to cope with natural plant toxins since the pathogen has an extraordinary wide host range. Chapter 3 describes fourteen ABC and three MFS transporter genes from B. cinerea. Two of the ABC transporters were described previously and the others were identified in an EST library of the fungus. Their role in DMI resistance was investigated by studying basal and induced expression in wild-type and DMI-resistant strains of B. cinerea. From this screen, it appeared that BcatrD was the most probable ABC transporter gene encoding a putative DMI transporter since basal expression in three isolates correlated with sensitivity to DMIs. Induced expression after treatment with DMIs also correlated with sensitivity to DMIs. The MFS transporter gene Bcmfs 1 might encode another DMI transporter since its basal expression in DMI resistant strains was also higher than that in the wild-type strain. The functional analysis of BcatrD and Bcmfs 1 is described in Chapters 4 and 5, respectively. This was achieved by phenotyping of gene replacement and overexpression mutants generated from the haploid wild-type strain B 05. 10. Replacement and overexpression mutants of BcatrD displayed an increased and decreased sensitivity to DMIs, respectively. Overexpression mutants of Bcmfs 1 also exhibited a decreased sensitivity to these fungicides while Bcmfs 1 replacement mutants showed similar sensitivity to DMIs as compared to the wild-type. To clarify the role of Bcmfs 1 in DMI-sensitivity in more detail, we constructed a double replacement mutant of BcatrD and Bcmfs 1. The double replacement mutant was more sensitive to DMIs than the single replacement mutant of BcatrD. These results suggest that BcatrD functions as a major DMI transporter and that Bcmfs 1 is of minor importance.   Accumulation of oxpoconazole by germlings of the mutants is also described in Chapter 4 and 5. Accumulation of oxpoconazole was transient in time as observed before for other DMIs and other filamentous fungi. The transient accumulation pattern is the result of passive influx and inducible active efflux of fungicides by transporters. The initial accumulation (20 min after the addition of oxpoconazole) level of oxpoconazole in the strains tested correlated with sensitivity to oxpoconazole. The steady state levels (more than 60 min after the addition of oxpoconazole) of accumulation by BcatrD and Bcmfs 1 replacement mutants were higher than that by the wild-type isolate. These results indicate that BcatrD and Bcmfs 1 mediate the sensitivity of B. cinerea to oxpoconazole by reducing the accumulation of the fungicide in mycelial cells...|$|R
