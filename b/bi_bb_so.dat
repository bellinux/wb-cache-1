40|$|The {{support of}} quality of service (QoS) in the Internet {{has become one of}} the most {{important}} topics within the Internet community. The introduction of the Integrated Services (IntServ) and the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) architectures was a major breakthrough in this direction. Enhanced by the Bandwidth Broker concept, DiffServ aims to provide QoS in the Internet through the prioritization of some IP flows over others. However, up to now the DiffServ architecture lacks a standard mechanism for the interaction between users/applications and the Bandwidth Brokers (<b>BB),</b> <b>so</b> that end-to-end QoS can be achieved. In this paper we present a distributed middleware architecture for the transparent support of QoS in the Internet. The paper focuses on bridging the gap that currently exists between applications and the network and presents the end-user application toolkit (EAT). The EAT middleware provides a framework for the presentation of network services to users, the description and selection of QoS parameters, the forwarding of reservation requests and the verification of the accredited QoS level. Through the concept of application profiles, it aims to support QoS for legacy applications, that is, commercial applications that cannot be modified to support QoS.

40|$|For some time, {{the use of}} {{rootstocks}} in viticulture is {{no longer}} considered only {{as a means of}} agronomic method to avoid the phylloxera damages (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae, Fitch, 1856), but as a tool to be able to influence the physiology of the cultivars and to adapt the vine’s behavior to the different soil conditions, the climatic characteristics and the cul- tivation techniques. In particular, it is increased the need to use the rootstock as a means to control the physiological processes of the plant, being the root activity closely related to that of the canopy, by exchanging signals and metabolites. The selection of the vine rootstocks started at the end of 1800, originated {{the main part of the}} rootstocks currently used in viticulture, using V. riparia and V. berlandieri. Subsequently, through the use of other genotypes were obtained new hybrids even more complex. Currently, in Italy there are 39 varieties of vine rootstock recognized on the National Register of Grapevine Varieties. but are essentially five, those used on large surfaces: Kober 5 <b>BB,</b> <b>SO</b> 4, 140 Ru, 1103 P, 110 R. In the past, for the diffusion has had an important role the need for nurserymen, who tended to favor rootstocks with excellent performance in propagation. While today there is a greater interest to satisfy the needs of viticulture’s tech- niques also as a consequence of the changed cultivations’ conditions. In fact, we need of new rootstocks able to adapt to environmental stresses caused by climate change in progress (mainly droughts and changes in the distribution of rainfall) and/or linked to new growing environments which have restricting factors for the vines. Moreover, the need to obtain specific qualitative characteristics (polyphenols content, grapes’ acidity, etc [...] ), suggest to deepen even more the aspects that can influence the wine quality. At the same time, it is necessary to reduce the period of selection (a new rootstock from crossing takes between 20 to 25 years), which through the use of molecular markers could also be reduced by half. In this paper we provided an overview about the behavior of some rootstocks tested in Tuscany during the last years. In particular, the survey covered the vigor, the productivity, and the characteristics of grapes at maturity, including the phenolic content. The rootstocks considered were: 420 A, Kober 5 <b>BB,</b> <b>SO</b> 4, 161 - 49, 140 Ru, 1103 P, 110 R, 779 P, 775 P, 3309 C, 101. 14, Fercal, Gravesac and 41 B...|$|R

Their response was compared to three ungrafted cultivars, Thompson Seedless, Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. To perform this study, two month-old plants produced from cuttings were inoculated with 5, 000 eggs per 3 -L pots, filled with steamed substrate and kept in a glasshouse covered with a black mesh to intercept 30 % of sun light and avoid heating of the substrates. After a growth period of six months, plants {{were removed from the}} pots, and resistance was determined by measuring root weights, the number of galls and eggs per g of root, and second stage juveniles per 250 cm(3) of soil. Results showed that the five rootstocks were resistant to the parasitism of the three Meloidogyne species, since their reproduction was limited and differed from two of the cultivars. Chardonnay was the most susceptible cultivar, mainly to the high level of parasitism by M. ethiopica, while Pinot Noir was moderately susceptible and Thompson Seedless showed the lowest susceptibility...|$|R
