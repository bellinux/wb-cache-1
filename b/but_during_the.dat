He could not marry a woman from a family of senatorial rank, nor achieve legitimate senatorial rank himself, <b>but</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> early Empire, freedmen held key positions in the government bureaucracy, so much so that Hadrian limited their participation by law.

5|$|Late 18th-century critics {{felt that}} Smart's madness {{justified}} them in ignoring his A Song to David, <b>but</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> following century Robert Browning and his contemporaries considered his condition {{to be the}} source of his genius. It was not until the 20th century, with the rediscovery of Jubilate Agno (not published until 1939), that critics reconsidered Smart's case and began to see him as a revolutionary poet, the possible target of a plot by his father-in-law, a publisher, to silence him.|$|E

5|$|The Corn Exchange, {{situated}} at the junction of Bank Street and Elwick Road, opened on 3 December 1861.

5|$|A coinage commemorating Edmund was minted {{from around}} the time East Anglia was absorbed by the kingdom of Wessex and a popular cult emerged. In about 986, Abbo of Fleury wrote {{of his life and}} martyrdom. The saint's remains were {{temporarily}} moved from Bury St Edmunds to London for safekeeping in 1010. His shrine at Bury was visited by many kings, including Canute, who was responsible for rebuilding the abbey: the stone church was rebuilt again in 1095. During the Middle Ages, when Edmund was regarded as the patron saint of England, Bury and its magnificent abbey grew wealthy, <b>but</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Dissolution of the Monasteries, his shrine was destroyed. Medieval manuscripts and works of art relating to Edmund include Abbo's Passio Sancti Eadmundi, John Lydgate's 14th-century Life, the Wilton Diptych and a number of church wall paintings.|$|E

He finally arrived in Siam on 23 October 1931, after spending over nine years abroad.|$|E
