5|$|Several basic {{offensive}} tactics {{come into}} play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base. The hit and run is sometimes employed with a skillful contact hitter: the runner takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating {{a gap in the}} infield for the batter to poke the ball through. The sacrifice bunt calls for the batter to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into scoring position even {{at the expense of the}} batter being thrown out at first—a batter who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice. (A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit.) A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at <b>bringing</b> <b>that</b> runner home, is known as a squeeze play. With a runner on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful batter, in this case, gets credit for a sacrifice fly. The manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch.|$|E

25|$|During sitting meditation, {{practitioners}} usually {{assume a}} position {{such as the}} lotus position, half-lotus, Burmese, or seiza postures, using the dhyāna mudrā. To regulate the mind, awareness is directed towards counting or watching the breath or by <b>bringing</b> <b>that</b> awareness to the energy center below the navel (see also ānāpānasati). Often, a square or round cushion placed on a padded mat is used to sit on; in some other cases, a chair may be used. This practice may simply be called sitting dhyāna, which is zuòchán (坐禅) in Chinese, and zazen (坐禅) in Japanese, jwaseon (坐禅) in Korean.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, spoken Demotic, while not {{recognised}} {{as an official}} language, nevertheless developed a supra-regional, de facto standard variety. From the late 19th century onwards, written Demotic rather than Katharevousa became the primary medium of literature. During much of the 20th century, there were heated political conflicts {{over the use of}} either of the two varieties, especially over the issue of their use in education. Schools were forced to switch from one form to the other and back several times during the 20th century. The conflict was resolved only after the overthrow of the Greek military junta of 1967-1974, whose strong ideological pro-Katharevousa stance had ultimately contributed to <b>bringing</b> <b>that</b> language form into disrepute. In 1976, shortly after the restoration of democracy, Demotic was finally adopted for use everywhere in education and became the language of the state for all official purposes. By that time, however, the form of Demotic used in practice was no longer the pure popular dialect, but had begun to assimilate elements from the Katharevousa tradition again. In 1982 diacritics were replaced by the monotonic orthography.|$|E

500|$|In a June 9, 2009 interview, Craven {{expressed}} his displeasure in the remaking of his 1984 film, primarily because the filmmakers {{chose not to}} have him {{as a consultant to}} the film, unlike with the 2009 remake The Last House on the Left where he [...] "shepherd it towards production". In contrast, Robert Englund, who portrayed Freddy throughout the film series, felt it was time for A Nightmare on Elm Street to be remade. Englund liked the idea of being able to [...] "exploit the dreamscape" [...] with CGI and other technologies that did not exist when Craven was making the original Nightmare on Elm Street in 1984. Subsequently, Bayer believed that the film is designed to pay homage to what Craven did in 1984, but not replicate it entirely. Bayer recognized that Craven attempted to put more meaning into his films, and that the character of Freddy Krueger was one that affected the lives of a certain generation of people. For Bayer, remaking A Nightmare on Elm Street was about <b>bringing</b> <b>that</b> feeling to a new generation, with a new spin on the character and story.|$|E
2500|$|Professor Wallace Clift, also an Episcopal priest, {{explored}} {{similarities between}} Jung’s vision of humanity as “a story of developing consciousness” with Christianity’s doctrine of “the Holy Spirit understood as present in each person. ... It {{is not a}} matter of making out each person a ‘God’, but on the contrary, realizing that within each person lies the potentiality of responding to God by <b>bringing</b> <b>that</b> encounter into consciousness.” He further proposed the existence of a new post-Jungian archetype of pilgrimage.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the events}} of the Night of the Long Knives, Franz von Papen still had a role to play in the regime. Since Hitler wanted Papen out of Berlin, he offered him the {{assignment}} of German ambassador to Vienna, where Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss had just been murdered in a failed Nazi coup, which was brutally suppressed. The murdered Dolffuss was replaced as Chancellor by Kurt von Schuschnigg. Weinberg wrote that as Papen was [...] "a schemer without much talent, a bother to Hitler as Vice-Chancellor, and a professing Catholic, he was just the man for the job of bamboozling the Austrians until they could be pressured or intrigued into the Reich". Despite the murders of his friends Jung, Klausener, and Bose together with the murder of his former best friend Schleicher in the Night of the Long Knives, Papen was still loyal to the Nazi regime and he accepted the offer to be ambassador to Austria. Weinberg wrote that Papen went to work at this point using [...] "subversive tactics" [...] in Vienna similar to those he employed against the United States during the First World War. Papen was a German nationalist who always believed that Austria was destined to join Germany in an Anschluss and felt that a success in <b>bringing</b> <b>that</b> about might restore his career. Papen during his time as an ambassador to Austria stood outside the normal chain of command of the Auswärtige Amt as Papen refused to take orders from the Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath who had served as his foreign minister in 1932 when he was Chancellor, and instead Papen reported directly to Hitler as all of his diplomatic dispatches went to the Führer rather than the Foreign Minister, much to Neurath's vexation as he found himself largely excluded from the decision-making with regards to Austria.|$|E
