5|$|Florence Nagle (26 October 1894– 30 October 1988) was {{a trainer}} and <b>breeder</b> of racehorses, a <b>breeder</b> of {{pedigree}} dogs, and an active feminist. Nagle purchased her first Irish Wolfhound in 1913, {{and went on}} to own or breed twenty-one United Kingdom Champions. Best in Show at Crufts in 1960 was awarded to Sulhamstead Merman, who was bred, owned and exhibited by Nagle. She also competed successfully in field trials with Irish Setters, from the 1920s until the mid-1960s resulting in eighteen Field Trial Champions. The male dog who was a linchpin in the 1970s revival of the Irish Red and White Setter breed was descended from one of Nagle's Irish Setters.|$|E
5|$|In North America, the {{original}} Jefferson flock of Shetlands did not persist. Other importations {{were made at}} the beginning of the twentieth century most notably to Mrs. W.W. Burch of Coopersville, MI (wife of the Editor of the American Sheep <b>Breeder</b> at the time), and Mr. L.V. Harkness of the Walnut Hall (the same of Standardbred Horse fame). There is record of these flocks surviving until 1916, and also record of another flock in Illinois in 1917. By 1921, it was recorded that Shetlands could not be bought in the U.S. (The Sheep <b>Breeder,</b> 1921). It was not until the mid-twentieth century that Shetlands were imported into Canada, and then from Canada into the United States in the 1980s. Since then, a North American Shetland Sheep Registry has been established, and there are now thousands of the breed in the region.|$|E

5|$|Many cultivars {{have been}} {{selected}} for horticultural use, either selected forms or hybrids with other Grevillea species. One prominent early <b>breeder</b> was Leo Hodge of W Tree, Victoria. Hodge became interested in breeding grevilleas after finding seedlings in his garden.

40|$|International audienceUsing {{data from}} a 17 -year study of {{individually}} marked Blue Petrels, we examined how survival and breeding probability varied with experience and breeding status, and looked for costs of first reproduction, taking into account environmental and individual variability. Using multistate capture–recapture models with four states (inexperienced nonbreeders, first-time <b>breeders,</b> experienced <b>breeders,</b> and experienced nonbreeders), we found that first-time <b>breeders</b> had a lower probability of surviving and breeding {{in the next year}} than experienced <b>breeders.</b> Survival of first-time <b>breeders</b> was lower than that of inexperienced nonbreeders, indicating a cost of first reproduction. Survival of inexperienced individuals (both <b>breeders</b> and nonbreeders), but not of experienced ones, was negatively affected by poor environmental oceanographic conditions. The costs of reproduction for first-time <b>breeders</b> were particularly marked during harsh weather conditions. Survival and the probability of breeding in the next year for experienced birds were higher for <b>breeders</b> than for nonbreeders. Similarly, the probability of breeding in the next year for first-time <b>breeders</b> was higher than for inexperienced nonbreeders. This suggests heterogeneity in quality among individuals. Experienced <b>breeders</b> had a higher body condition than firsttime <b>breeders</b> and nonbreeders. Body condition did not affect the probability of surviving or breeding in the next year. These results can be interpreted in the light of a change in the proportion of individuals with different survival (selection hypothesis: low-quality individuals die sooner). The inferiority of first-time <b>breeders</b> may be linked to a higher proportion of lower-quality individuals in younger age classes. First reproduction may act as a filter, selecting individuals of higher quality. Sea surface height, reflecting food availability, is probably a key selective agent...|$|R
40|$|The age of broiler <b>breeders</b> is an {{important}} parameter {{to be taken into}} account by the hatchery manager. Eggs produced by young or old <b>breeders</b> do not hatch as well as the eggs from the <b>breeders</b> of 40 to 42 wks of age. Field reports indicate that there are quadratic relationships between age of <b>breeders</b> and absolute egg weight loss during incubation, age of <b>breeders</b> and hatchability, and age of <b>breeders</b> and embryonic mortality. There is a trend of optimum relative egg weight loss on Day 18 of incubation for the highest hatchability. These results indicate that the eggs that incubate best are produced by the hens of 40 to 42 wk of age. It is suggested that the egg characteristics and the age of <b>breeders</b> have {{to be taken into account}} during incubation in order to design optimal incubation conditions and to improve hatchability. However, because the relative egg weight loss is not linked to the age of <b>breeders,</b> regulation of relative humidity during incubation to achieve optimum weight loss may take into account only the eggs characteristics. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{value of}} skin tests was assessed in 35 patients affected by bird <b>breeder's</b> disease {{by comparing the}} results with those obtained in a group of 27 symptomless <b>breeders</b> and 10 symptomless unexposed individuals. Sterilised and diluted serum and lyophilised extracts of faeces prepared from the <b>breeder's</b> own birds were injected intradermally. Skinprick tests using the same materials were carried out simultaneously. The intradermal test using serum showed a positive reaction in 18 out of 20 patients tested and in three out of 20 symptomless <b>breeders</b> (p less than 0. 0005); later reactions occurred in eight of the patients and one of the symptomless <b>breeders</b> (p less than 0. 01). A delayed reaction was seen in five of the patients and one of the symptomless <b>breeders</b> (p = 0. 09). No positive reactions were recorded in symptomless unexposed individuals. Intradermal skin testing using extracts of faeces yielded an immediate reaction in 19 of 21 patients and in three of 11 symptomless <b>breeders</b> tested (p less than 0. 001); a late reaction was seen in 18 of the patients and in five of the symptomless <b>breeders</b> (p less than 0. 05). Delayed reactions occurred in 11 of the 21 patients tested, whereas no positive responses were seen in symptomless <b>breeders</b> (p less than 0. 025).

Racehorse breeding {{is a full-time}} professional activity for a third of interviewees. The holdings are small-sized with 77 % owning one or two mares. The regular practice of mating is here used to categorize <b>breeders</b> according to their degree of professionalization (38. 4 % professional vs. 61. 6 % occasional <b>breeders).</b> Experience in the sector was also used to classify <b>breeders,</b> considering as "junior" the <b>breeders</b> under 10 years experience (38. 8 %) and as "senior" those above 10 years (61. 2 %).
