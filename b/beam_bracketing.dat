The building structure is spatial frame where dilatations were applied. The proper stiffness of its structure is provided by frames with stiff joints, monolithic lift shifts and staircases. The prefabricated slab floors are supported by beam shelves which are shaped as inverted letter ‘T’. Beams are supported by the column brackets. In order to lower the storey height and fulfill the architectural demands at the same time, the designer lowered the height of beam at the support zone. The analyzed case refers to the bracket zone where the slant crack. on the support <b>beam</b> <b>bracket</b> was observed. It could appear {{as a result of}} overcrossing of allowable tension stresses in reinforced concrete, in the bracket zone. It {{should be noted that the}} construction solution applied, i. e. concurrent support of the “undercut” beam on the column bracket causes local concentration of stresses in the undercut zone where the strongest transverse forces and tangent stresses occur concurrently. Some additional rectangular stresses being a result of placing the slab floors on the lower part of beam shelves sum up with those described above...|$|R

Iodine-containing contrast agent is introduced into the venous side of the circulation. The principle involved in the imaging procedure is that of iodine K-edge dichromography, in which two monochromatic X-ray <b>beams,</b> closely <b>bracketing</b> the K-edge of iodine (33 keV), are used to acquire a pair of line images, recorded within 0. 4 msec of each other. The logarithmic subtraction of the images provides an image which enhances attenuation signals arising from iodine and virtually eliminates signals arising from attenuation by body structures. The images are recorded in line scan fashion, usually at a rate of 12 cm/sec. Photons are detected by a silicon-lithium linear detector with sensitive elements which provide spatial resolution of 0. 5 mm X 0. 5 mm.

A new monochromator in Laue transmission geometry has been developed, successfully tested at beamline ID 11 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) and is now in use at the angiography wiggler beamline W 2 at HASYLAB. The monochromator consists of two almost identical goniometer heads which are independently controlled. Within each head a bent silicon single crystal extracts a quasimonochromatic beam and focuses it vertically to the patient thus also increasing intensity compared to an unbent crystal. With a storage ring current of 50 mA the new monochromator provides 0. 8 × 1011 photons/mm 2 /s in front of the patient which is an increase by a factor of 6 compared to the formerly used Bragg design with Ge crystals.

40|$|The {{development}} of a non-invasive method of visualizing gene expression in larger animals could revolutionize some aspects of gene research by opening up {{a wider variety of}} animal systems to explore; some of which may be better models of human systems. Presently, most gene expression studies employ Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) transfected into the genome of the animal system. For larger animals, an “x-ray” equivalent of GFP would be desirable due to the high penetrating power of x-rays. A model gene modification system is to use the Sodium (Na) Iodide Symporter (NIS) which will cause the accumulation of iodine in cells which express the NIS. To non-invasively observe the dilute iodine accumulated by the cancer cells transfected with NIS in the head of small animals, such as a rat, two synchrotron-based imaging methods were studied: K-Edge Subtraction (KES) imaging and Fluorescence Subtraction Imaging (FSI). KES needs wide monochromatic x-ray beams at two energies bracketing the K-edge of the contrast agent existing or injected in the tissues. The monochromatic beam in the synchrotron facility normally is prepared by a double crystal monochromator. The appearance of the azimuthal angle (tilt error) in the double crystal monochromator creates intensity variations across the imaging field. This misalignment was studied through another two synchrotron-based imaging methods, Diffraction Enhanced Imaging (DEI) and Multi-Image Radiography (MIR), which show this problem clearly in their processed images. The detailed analysis of the effect of the tilt error, how it affects the resulting images, and how to quantify such an error were presented in the thesis. A post processing method was implemented and the artifacts caused by the improper experimental settings were discussed. With the wide monochromatic beam prepared by the double crystal monochromator, a sequence of KES experiments were done and the detection limit of KES was quantified at a projected amount of 17. 5 mM-cm iodine in a physical model of a rat head with a radiation dose of 2. 65 mGy. With the raster scan of the object relative to the monochromatic pencil beam, FSI was studied to obtain higher Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) for local area and better detection limit compared to KES. The detection limit of FSI was measured as a projected amount of 2. 5 mM-cm iodine in the same physical rat head with a tolerable radiation dose of 24 mGy. According to the comparison of these two imaging techniques with references to imaging time and area, radiation dose, spatial resolution, and SNR, it was concluded that these two imaging techniques can be used complementarily in imaging dilute contrast material. Due to the short imaging time and large imaging area, KES is used first to provide a global view of the object, locate the area of interest, do the preliminary diagnosis, and decide whether the further FSI is necessary. Due to its high SNR for the dilute sample, FSI can be used when the area of interest is known. The combination of these two imaging techniques will be very promising and powerful. To facilitate the comparison of KES and FSI, a quality factor was developed to evaluate the performance of the imaging system. The measured detection limits in our experiments are far beyond the thyroidal iodine concentration of a rat (around 1 mM). To further improve the performance of KES, a bent Laue crystal monochromator was designed to do the simultaneous iodine KES imaging which overcomes the artifacts in the iodine image caused by the temporal difference for a single set of images. The designed monochromator can provide two separated x-ray <b>beams</b> <b>bracketing</b> the K-edge of iodine at the same time with a very high spatial resolution which is only depends on the source size, a very high energy resolution which can almost compete with that of the double crystal monochromator, and an acceptable photon flux...|$|R

50|$|The {{architecture}} of the Ten Great Buildings is a composite of factors based in modernism, communism, and historicism. Chinese architecture {{at the time was}} shaped by review of its own historical models mixed with external influences. Debate was vigorous in publications such as the Architectural Journal prior to the constructions, and history, modernity and influence were being conceptualized and reconsidered. A criticism of this initiative is that while creating facilities for political, and cultural institutions, these public projects failed to provide for a needed increase in housing, however, a housing surge would occur in the country later in the century. Modern architecture brought to China, as it had to the west, a new economic and rational manner of building, and the modernist buildings of the group were the least decorated by the public art campaign. Examples of this are the Workers' Stadium, the Minzu Hotel, and the Overseas Chinese Hotel. The modernist tenets of function and structure were realized in these buildings, yet these were attributed both to western capitalist influences and the Soviet notion of the proletariat. The Soviet architecture inspired examples from the Ten Buildings are the Great Hall of the People, the National Museum of China, and the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Museum. The Great Hall of the People and the National Museum of China across from it on the square continue the numerology of tens—each having ten freestanding columns in their facades. The architectural aspects of the traditionally inspired buildings included large and heavy roofs laden with ceramic tiles. These were often stacked in multiple layers recalling the towering form of the pagoda. Another feature is upturned corners and curved ridges on hipped edges. Beneath these thick composite toppings are layers of <b>beams,</b> and <b>brackets</b> known as dougong. Examples of this type of architecture among the Ten Great Constructions are the Beijing railway station, the Nationalities Cultural Palace, and the National Agriculture Exhibition Hall.|$|R
40|$|Modular {{systems have}} been mostly {{researched}} in relatively low-rise structures but, lately, their applications to mid- to high-rise structures began to be reviewed, and research interest in new modularization subjects has increased. The application of modular systems to mid- to high-rise structures requires the structural stability of the frame and connections that consist of units, and {{the evaluation of the}} stiffness of structures that are combined in units. However, the combination of general units causes loss of the cross-section of columns or beams, resulting in low seismic performance and hindering installation works in the field. In addition, the evaluation of a frame considering such a cross-sectional loss is not easy. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a joint that is stable and easy to install. In the study, a rigidly connected modular system was proposed as a moment-resisting frame for a unit modular system, and their joints were developed and their performances were compared. The proposed system changed the ceiling <b>beam</b> into a <b>bracket</b> type to fasten bolts. It can be merged with other seismic force-resisting systems. To verify the seismic performance of the proposed system, a cyclic loading test was conducted, and the rigidly connected joint performance and integrated behavior at the joint of modular units were investigated. From the experimental results, the maximum resisting force of the proposed connection exceeded the theoretical parameters, indicating that a rigid joint structural performance could be secured...|$|R
