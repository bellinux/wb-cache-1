50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> 230 {{mosques and}} 274 dargahs were {{destroyed}} during the violence. For {{the first time}} in the history of communal riots Hindu women took part, looting Muslim shops. It <b>is</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> up to 150,000 people were displaced during the violence. It <b>is</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> 200 police officers died while trying to control the violence, and Human Rights Watch reported that acts of exceptional heroism were committed by Hindus, Dalits and tribals who tried to protect Muslims from the violence.|$|R
50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> {{more than}} 50 {{percent of all}} {{wildlife}} has {{been lost in the}} last 40 years. in 2020 it <b>is</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> 68% of the world's wildlife will be lost. In South America, there is believed to be a 70 percent loss.|$|R
5000|$|It <b>is</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> only 10-20 {{percent of}} women are working in the streets; however, it <b>is</b> also <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> 90 percent of the arrests of prostitutes are of street workers.|$|R
5|$|It has <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> {{all of the}} English witch trials {{between the}} early 15th and early 18th centuries {{resulted}} in fewer than 500 executions, so this one trial, with its 18 executions, accounted for 3.6% of that total.|$|E
5|$|The monastery at Wearmouth-Jarrow had an {{excellent}} library. Both Benedict Biscop and Ceolfrith had acquired books from the Continent, and in Bede's day the monastery was a renowned centre of learning. It has <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> there were about 200 books in the monastic library.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of a nominal roll or other records listing the Australians {{who took part in the}} D-Day landings, it is not {{possible}} to determine the exact number involved. However, it has <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> about 3,000 Australian military personnel and merchant seamen participated in the operation. The total number of Australians killed on 6 June was 14, of whom 12 were RAAF airmen and two were members of the RAN.|$|E

5|$|Emperors of the {{proceeding}} Song dynasty (960–1279) {{tended to}} marry from {{within their own}} borders. Tang emperors, mainly took their wives from high-ranking bureaucratic families, but the Song dynasty did not consider rank important {{when it came to}} selecting their consorts. It has <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> only a quarter of Song consorts were from such families, with the rest being from lower status backgrounds. For example, Liu, consort of Emperor Zhenzong, had been a street performer and consort Miao, wife of Emperor Renzong was the daughter of his own wet nurse.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{retirement}} from the NWMP, Primrose {{was offered the}} position of a police magistrate in Edmonton. Primrose accepted, as he had always wanted to retire in the city. In 1917, he was chairman of the three-person Alberta Provincial Police board of commissioners, where he was tasked with supervising the new force. Before {{his retirement}} as magistrate in July 1935, it had <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> he had dealt with over 40,000 cases.|$|E
5|$|Globally, Mozzarella is {{the most}} popular pizza cheese. However, it has <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> in the United States only 30% of all pizza cheese used is actual Mozzarella. Provolone is the second most popular one. Cheddar may be mixed with Mozzarella to {{preserve}} chewiness. Grated Parmesan may be added {{to the top of a}} pizza, and typically does not melt well when cooked. A diverse variety of processed pizza cheeses are produced, including analogue cheese. Provel is one example. Other pizza cheeses include Emmental, Romano and Ricotta for calzones or as a topping.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a direct}} result of Sherman’s March through the South, {{thousands}} of slaves left their plantations and workplaces and joined Sherman’s army as refugees. It <b>is</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> between 17,000 and 25,000 newly freed enslaved people followed Sherman’s army during the march through Georgia. [...] It <b>is</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> 8,000 of these newly freed individuals followed the army into Savannah. [...] In addition, it <b>is</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> 7,587 individuals <b>were</b> freed from slavery in Savannah and its surrounding areas on December 21, 1864. [...] Wherever Sherman’s March went throughout Georgia and the Carolina’s, he was enforcing the provisions of the Emancipation Proclamation.|$|R
5|$|It has <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> of 92 {{potentially}} possible {{modes of}} life – combinations of feeding style, tiering and motility — {{no more than}} a dozen are occupied {{by the end of the}} Ediacaran. Just four are represented in the Avalon assemblage. The lack of large-scale predation and vertical burrowing are perhaps the most significant factors limiting the ecological diversity; the emergence of these during the Early Cambrian allowed the number of lifestyles occupied to rise to 30.|$|E
5|$|It has <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> {{the group}} {{containing}} the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire diverged from genera like Goura about 1.5 million years ago. However, that estimate appears highly unlikely. It was {{estimated that the}} relatives of the two species moved to the island about 35 million years ago, when a land bridge between Nazareth (Rodrigues) or St. Brandon banks and Mauritius formed.|$|E
5|$|It has <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> {{the solid}} earth {{as a whole}} {{contains}} 730 ppm of carbon, with 2000 ppm in the core and 120 ppm in the combined mantle and crust. Since {{the mass of the}} earth is , this would imply 4360 million gigatonnes of carbon. This is much more than the amount of carbon in the oceans or atmosphere (below).|$|E

5|$|New {{species in}} the Russulaceae {{continue}} to be described from various regions, such as the US, Guyana, Brazil, Patagonia, Togo, Sri Lanka, or Thailand. It has <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> the real number of Russula species in North America alone (currently around 400 described) might {{be as high as}} 2000. Cryptic species may increase true diversity: some morphologically well-defined species, especially in Lactifluus, have been shown to actually encompass several phylogenetic species.|$|E
5|$|The {{freshwater}} {{islands in}} Scotland include those within freshwater lochs and rivers – including tidal areas, so the islands {{may not always}} be surrounded by freshwater. It has <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> there are at least 31,460 freshwater lochs in Scotland and that 1.9% of the land surface is covered by fresh waters. The distribution has a north west to south east gradient with the highest concentrations occurring in the islands of the Outer Hebrides.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{publication of the}} proceedings by the clerk to the court, Thomas Potts, in his The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster, {{and the number of}} witches hanged together – nine at Lancaster and one at York – make the trials unusual for England at that time. It has <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> all the English witch trials between the early 15th and early 18th centuries resulted in fewer than 500 executions; this series of trials accounts for more than two per cent of that total.|$|E

5|$|Within 100 {{years of}} the {{appearance}} of Mendeleev's table in 1869 it has <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> around 700 different periodic table versions were published. As well as numerous rectangular variations, other periodic table formats have been shaped, for example, like a circle, cube, cylinder, building, spiral, lemniscate, octagonal prism, pyramid, sphere, or triangle. Such alternatives are often developed to highlight or emphasize chemical or physical properties of the elements that are not as apparent in traditional periodic tables.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{feature of}} the meeting at Peterloo {{was the number of}} women present. Female reform societies had been formed in North West England during June and July 1819, the first in Britain. Many of the women were dressed distinctively in white, and some formed all-female contingents, carrying their own flags. Of the 654recorded casualties, at least 168 were women, four of whom died either at St Peter's Field or later {{as a result of their}} wounds. It has <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> less than 12 per cent of the crowd was made up of women, suggesting that they were at significantly greater risk of injury than men by a factor of almost 3:1. Richard Carlile claimed that the women were especially targeted, a view apparently supported by the large number who suffered from wounds caused by weapons.|$|E
5|$|At 22:00 on 16 December 1941, Corregidor {{left its}} dock in Manila in total darkness, loaded to {{overcapacity}} with Filipino civilians seeking {{to escape to}} the southern Philippines after the war had started. It has <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> between 1,200 and 1,500 people were on board, including approximately 150 Philippine soldiers, 7 Americans, 5 Philippine legislators, and hundreds of college students who were traveling home after their schools had closed. Also aboard were military supplies as well the entire artillery complement of the Visayan-Mindanao Force of the Philippine Army. The owners of the ship failed to inform the Navy's Inshore Patrol of the ship's plan to leave Manila Bay.|$|E
