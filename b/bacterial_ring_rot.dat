40|$|The biggest {{difference}} between organic and conventional seed potato production {{is that the}} use of fungicides against potato late blight and seed borne diseases are forbidden in organic farming. The quarantine diseases such as <b>bacterial</b> <b>ring</b> <b>rots</b> and diseases limited in certified seed, like Erwinia soft rots are a serious threat to organic seed potato production. However the management strategies against these diseases are similar in both organic and conventional production. At the present only one producer in Finland is growing certified organic seed potato. Due to problems in plant protection there has not been enough courage among farmers to specialise organic seed potato production. The aim of current study is to develop crop management strategies for organic seed potato production with a special emphasise to potato late blight and Rhizoctonia diseases to provide sustainable certified seed potato production to fulfil the demand by organic potato growers. The most important research areas and tasks are: 1. The effect of cropping history and crop rotations to late blight epidemics and occurrence of Rhizoctonia black scurf 2. The importance of seed potato as primary inoculum source for potato late blight 3. The relative importance of composts, waste piles and volunteer plants as a source of primary inoculum for potato late blight 4.

The results showed that the optimum extraction conditions of antimicrobial substances from L. japonica were an extraction temperature of 80 °C, an extraction time of 12 h, and a solid to liquid ratio of 1 ∶ 25. Active compounds of L. japonica were isolated by solvent partition, thin layer chromatography (TLC) and column chromatography. All nineteen fractionations had antimicrobial activities against C. michiganense subsp. sepedonicum, while Fractionation three (Fr. 3) had the highest (P< 0. 05) antimicrobial activity. Chemical composition analysis identified a total of 26 components in Fr. 3. The main constituents of Fr. 3 were alkanes (80. 97 %), esters (5. 24 %), acids (4. 87 %) and alcohols (2. 21 %). Antimicrobial activity of Fr. 3 against C. michiganense subsp. sepedonicum could be attributed to its ability to damage the cell wall and cell membrane, induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increase cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration, inhibit the glycolytic pathway (EMP) and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, inhibit protein and nucleic acid synthesis, and disrupt the normal cycle of DNA replication.

The {{results showed that the}} leaf extracts of P. orientale had significantly (p< 0. 05) greater antibacterial activity against C. michiganense subsp. sepedonicum than root, stem, flower extracts in vitro. According to the results of single factor experiments and L(27) 3 (13) orthogonal experiments, optimum extraction conditions were A 1 B 3 C 1, extraction time 6 h, temperature 80 °C, solid to liquid ratio 1 ∶ 10 (g:mL). The highest (p< 0. 05) antibacterial activity was observed when pH was 5, excluding the effect of control. The extracts were stable under ultraviolet (UV). In vivo analysis revealed that 50 mg/mL of P. orientale leaf extracts was effective in controlling decay. Under field conditions, 50 mg/mL of P. orientale leaf extracts also improved growth parameters (whole plant length, shoot length, root length, plant fresh weight, shoot fresh weight, root fresh weight, dry weight, and number of leaves), in the 2010 and 2011 two growing seasons.

The seed potato production area was 1290 hectares year 2006. The seed potato production is concentrated in the Nothern parts of Finland where the High Grade Region (Tyrnävä and Liminka in the Oulu region) {{for the production of}} seed potato is located. Four generations of prebasic seed (class SS, S, SEE and SE), three generations of basic seed (class EC 1, EC 2 and EC 3) and one generation of certified seed (class A or B) are produced in Finland. The seed potato inspection schema of Finland includes several steps: the field inspection, the laboratory tests of potato cyst nematodes, <b>bacterial</b> <b>ring</b> <b>rot,</b> brown rot and potato virus and finally the visual tuber inspection. The field inspection, sampling and visual tuber inspection are done by the authorized inspectors. For prebasic and basic seed the inspectors make two official field inspections. For certified seed only one field inspection is needed. Official requirements are set for varietal purity, rogues, potato virus, black leg (Erwinia spp.) and Rhizoctonia. During the field inspection the background information as previous crop is checked. The soil sample for testing potato cyst nematodes is taken per each hectare. The potato cyst nematodes (Globodera sp.) are quarantine organisms and the seed potato production is not possible on the field infected by the nematodes. In the autumn the tubers for winter tests in the laboratory are sampled. For <b>bacterial</b> <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> a sample is 200 tubers/ha and for virus tests 200 tubers/field. Brown rot is tested as a survey of seed potato production. The testing method for <b>bacterial</b> <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> (Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus) and brown rot (Ralstonia solanacearum) is the immunofluorescense (IF) method based on the specific antibodies. These quarantine organisms are not accepted in the seed potato production. The potato virus Y-, A-, X-, S-, M- and Potato Leaf Roll are tested once during seed potato certification process usually as the prebasic seed. For the other seed classes the potato virus Y and potato virus A are tested. For certified seed potato class A there is a list of varieties which are tested. The seed class B is not routinely tested. The testing method is ELISAtest. The seed potato companies need certificate labels before sorting and packing potatoes. A visual tuber inspection is done by the local inspectors. A sample of 400 tubers/ 50 tn is cut by knife and tubers are inspected one by one. There are requirements for soil, dry and wet rot, external blemishes, common scab, black scurf, skin spot and deep-pitted scab. The quarantine organisms or visual symtops of moptop virus or tobacco rattle virus are not accepted. If all steps of inspection and testing are according to legislation, the seed potato lot is officially certified and can be marketed as seed potato to the farmers. vokMyynti MTT Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|E

Recent discoveries related to pathogenesis of Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus (Cms), causal agent of <b>bacterial</b> <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> of potato, {{are beginning to}} shed light on the virulence strategies of this species. The chromosomal homologue of pat- 1, chp 7, was found to be necessary for HR elicitation in tobacco and virulence of Cms in eggplant and potato. Multiple chromosomal and plasmid-encoded homologues of pat- 1 (chp and php genes, respectively) are present in Cms, yet only the function of chp 7 has been evaluated. The development of molecular resources and techniques for genetic manipulation of Cms are needed to facilitate studies aimed at building a more comprehensive understanding of the role of pat- 1 homologues in pathogenesis. Knockout mutants chp 7 and php 3 of Cms were generated via targeted mutagenesis. The virulence of chp 7 and php 3 mutants of Cms were evaluated on eggplant and potato. Significant reductions in virulence of Cms were observed for chp 7 and php 3 mutants in both eggplant and potato. Mutation of chp 7 also resulted in the loss of non-hostHR induction and an observed reduction in bacterial titer of infected plants. These phenotypes however, were not observed in php 3 mutants of Cms. A mutant of chp 8 was identified in a newly generated EzTn 5 transposon library of Cms. The virulence of the chp 8 mutant of Cms was evaluated in eggplant. Significant reductions in both bacterial titer of infected plant tissue and virulence of Cms were observed for the chp 8 mutant. In summary, three pat- 1 homologues from Cms have now been evaluated for their relative contributions to virulence, and these studies indicate that each is likely contributing differently to pathogenesis of Cms.

Development of an appropriate assay for assessing biofilm formation by Cms is a necessary first step towards addressing the role of biofilms in <b>bacterial</b> <b>ring</b> <b>rot.</b> Two of the biofilm assays examined in this study could be considered as potential strategies for future assessment of biofilm formation by Cms.

40|$|The {{ring rot}} disease of potato, {{caused by the}} Gram-positive bacterium, Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. {{sepedonicus}} (Cms), is under good regulatory control in Canada. With a zero tolerance for the disease in seed potato production, and a certification requirement for annual laboratory indexing of selected seed lots for the possible presence of asymptomatic latent infections, occurrences of <b>bacterial</b> <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> are infrequent and limited in scope. The laboratory indexing requirement {{is considered to be}} a particularly important component of the seed certification program for ring rot control, because the disease, when first present, is, under Canadian production conditions, often not detected by field inspection of growing crops or by bin inspection of harvested tubers, and will be of increasing importance should changing climatic conditions impact negatively on symptom expression. In Canada, the primary test for laboratory indexing is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a monoclonal antibody targeting the Cms extracellular polysaccharide, followed by a somatic antigen-directed monoclonal antibody-based immunofluorescence (IMF) confirmatory test for ELISA positive samples. A real-time (kinetic) PCR test (kPCR) using TaqMan chemistry, adapted from a published method and supplemented with an internal reaction control (RC) was implemented to evaluate the efficiency of the serological methods. The RC was constructed from a corn invertase gene fragment flanked by sequences complementary to the Cms primers, and was designed to generate an amplicon that differed from the Cms-specific amplicon but by its amplification would confirm the absence of PCR inhibitory substances in template DNA. The RC construct was cloned into plasmid vector pCRII-TOPO (to create plasmid, pCmsC 4) and propagated in Escherichia coli strain DHá-T 1. The RC amplicon did not hybridize to the Cms-specific TaqMan probe, but could be detected in kPCR runs with the inclusion of SYBR Green in the reaction mix. The Cmsspecific and the RC amplicons were readily distinguished by their respective postamplification melting temperatures in the presence of SYBR Green. The addition of 100 copies of pCmsC 4 to the reaction mix did not adversely affect sensitivity of Cms detection by kPCR. The presence of Cms in all ELISA/IMF-positive samples was confirmed by kPCR. However, in a 320 -sample data set, 50 % of ELISA-positive samples with cell counts below the IMF threshold were positive by kPCR, verifying the applicability of kPCR as a valuable additional confirmatory test. In the same data set, 16 % of samples that had both ELISA and IMF readings below the positive thresholds were positive by kPCR.

There are 110 pseudogenes with overrepresentation in functions associated with carbohydrate metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and pathogenicity. Genome comparisons also indicated that there is substantial gene content diversity within the species, probably due to differential gene acquisition and loss. These genomic features and evolutionary dating suggest that there was recent adaptation for life in a restricted niche where nutrient diversity and perhaps competition are low, correlated with a reduced ability to exploit previously occupied complex niches outside the plant.

It is characte- ristically a crop of the cool, temperate regions or of elevation of approximately 2000 m or more in the tropics. It requires cool nights and well drained soil with adequate moisture and does not produce well in low altitude, warm, tropical environment. Com-mercial production of most potatoes is primarily through vegetative propagation by means of lateral buds formed on the tuber, a modified stem. Trough such vegetative propagation, many diseases are transmitted from generation to generation. Suppression of such diseases and reduction of yield losses due to disease are a necessary part of increasing the food supply. The principles, strategies, and tactics of plant disease management are important to preven-ting yield losses. Integrated pest management (IPM) may supply effective control of the potato pests including aphids (vector of some viruses), Verticillium wilt blackleg, <b>bacterial</b> <b>ring</b> <b>rot,</b> Rhizoctonia, Phytophthora infestans (late blight) and several weeds (night shades, pigweeds, lambs quarters, and annual grasses). It includes regular inspection for healthy seed or nursery, crop production, correct identification of the problem, cultural practices (crop rotation, sani-tation etc.), biological control, soil fumigation (if necessary), seed or nursery stock treatment and disinfestations of cutting tools. In this re-view, pest management methods of potatoes included in IPM was summarized...|$|E
40|$|The {{quarantine}} bacterium Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus (Cms) causes <b>bacterial</b> <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> (BRR) in potato but {{is difficult}} to detect, hampering the diagnosis of this disease. ELISA immunoassays have not been widely used to detect Cms because commercially available anti-Cms antibodies detect mainly EPS-producing bacteria and can fail to detect strains that do not produce EPS. In the current study, we developed {{a new type of}} polyclonal antibody that specifically detects Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus bacteria irrespective of their EPS level. We first found that the presence of bacterial EPS precluded quantitative measurement of bacteria by currently available immunoenzymatic methods, but that washing Cms cells with acidic and basic buffers to remove EPS before analysis successfully standardized ELISA results. We used a mix of three strains of Cms with diverse EPS levels to generate antigen for production of antibodies recognizing Cms cells with and without an EPS layer (IgG-EPS and IgG-N-EPS, respectively). The resulting IgG-N-EPS recognized almost all Cms strains tested in this work regardless of their mucoidal level. The availability of this new antibody renders immunological diagnostics of Cms more sensitive and reliable, as our newly developed antibodies can be used in many type of immunoassays. This work represents an important step forward in efforts to diagnose and prevent the spread of BRR, and the methods and solutions developed in this work are covered by six Polish, one European and one US patents...|$|E
50|$|Laminated {{root rot}} {{also known as}} yellow <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> {{is caused by the}} fungal {{pathogen}} Phellinus weirii. Laminated root rot {{is one of the most}} damaging root disease amongst conifers in northwestern America and true firs, Douglas-fir, Mountain hemlock, and Western hemlock are highly susceptible to infection with P. weirii. A few species of plants such as Western white pine and Lodgepole pine are tolerant to the pathogen while Ponderosa pine is resistant to it. Only hardwoods are known to be immune to the pathogen.|$|R
40|$|Isolation of a {{phytotoxin}} {{from the}} <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> pathogen of potatoes, Corynebacterium sepedonicum, {{had previously been}} reported by Strobel (21). The first phase in our {{study was to investigate}} more extensively the general nature of this compound. The phytotoxin could possibly be a specific compound associated only with the <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> pathogen. However, the possibility that the substance could be obtained from sources other than the bacterium had not been completely eliminated. In an attempt to answer this question, three extracts were purified and compared. First, compounds were isolated from a broth culture of bacteria in the manner described by Strobel (21). Second since the culture medium consisted of yeast extract, the possibility that similar types of compounds could be obtained from this medium was considered. Third, materials that possessed wilting activity were isolated from whole bacterial cells which had been subjected to sonic oscillation. Upon isolation of these three extracts, the physical properties and biological activity were compared to determine their degree of similarity. An investigation was also made of the type of compound which was present in the extracts and capable of inducing biological activity. Preliminary work had shown the presence of nucleic acid in the extracts. Advisor: Ellen M. Bal...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> pathogen Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus (Cms) on activity of weak-associated with wall cell peroxidase of cell suspension cultures of two potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) cultivars which are differs in resistance to this pathogen during hypoand hyperthermia. In low resistant cultivar temperature changes {{did not cause}}d changes in weakassociated with wall cell peroxidase activity. Pathogen influence did not cause changes in its activity in these conditions too. At the same time pathogen actively grew under low temperature conditions, but at 38 0 C the increase of bacterial cell number was detected only during the first five days of experiment, but after this date bacterial cell began perishes. In resistant cultivar temperature increase caused some increase of peroxidase activity. Temperature decrease caused the decrease of peroxidase activity, but following pathogen addition caused increase of weak-associated with wall cell peroxidase activity. In high temperature conditions pathogen addition caused significant increase of peroxidase activity during the first minutes after pathogen addition (because of changes in peroxidase molecule activity) and after 1. 5 - 2 h of incubation (because of changes in genome expression and peroxidase synthesis). The data obtained allows us to conclude that if potatoes are putting in cold soil it could promote potato contamination by <b>ring</b> <b>rot...</b>|$|R
