5|$|Although NASA was {{supporting}} {{his work with}} grants of up to $500,000 per year, O'Neill became frustrated by the bureaucracy and politics inherent in government-funded research. He thought that small privately funded groups could develop space technology faster than government agencies. In 1977, O'Neill and his wife Tasha founded the Space Studies Institute, a non-profit organization, at Princeton University. SSI received initial funding of almost $100,000 from private donors, and in early 1978 began to support <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> into technologies needed for space manufacturing and settlement.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{number of}} recent {{therapeutic}} advances have resulted from <b>basic</b> science <b>research.</b> With the change in medical education and practice towards evidence-based medicine, we wished to determine the role of <b>basic</b> science <b>research</b> in Australian intensive care practice. We {{believe this is the}} first survey of Australian intensivists and trainees to assess the influence of <b>basic</b> science <b>research</b> on their clinical duties. We discuss the importance and influence of basic science in intensive care practice and the development of postgraduate appreciation of basic science, highlight the impact of some of the changes in medical education on basic science undergraduate teaching, and discuss the clinical applicability and current participation in <b>basic</b> science <b>research.</b> METHODS: A questionnaire was mailed in November 2006 to all registered Fellows and trainees of the Joint Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine who were resident in Australia. RESULTS: 267 of 801 surveys were returned (33 % response rate) : 74 % of respondents believed basic science is an important or very important influence on clinical decision making, which is consistent with previous studies, and 8 % believed it is crucial. The most familiar areas of <b>basic</b> science <b>research</b> are those with established clinical applications, such as drug metabolism, regional perfusion and the complement cascade. Most current intensive care practitioners were taught basic science as undergraduates. Involvement in <b>basic</b> science <b>research</b> increases during intensive care training, from 10 % before a medical degree to over 30 % at the end of training, with over a quarter of practicing intensivists having a basic science degree. Despite this increase in interest during training, only 9 % of journal club attendees reported that they discuss basic science articles. CONCLUSION: Critical care practitioners consider <b>basic</b> science <b>research</b> to be relevant and important to their practice. There is interest in clinically applicable <b>basic</b> science <b>research,</b> but few people regularly review basic science articles at journal clubs. Reassuringly, participation in <b>basic</b> science <b>research</b> increases throughout intensive care training, despite changes in medical education and lack of protected time for research...|$|R

5|$|In 1940, University of Miami President Bowman Ashe {{recruited}} F.G. Walton Smith, a young British {{marine biologist}} {{who was working}} in the Bahamas. Smith joined the Department of Zoology, and began organizing the development of a marine laboratory. In 1943, the Board of Trustees of the University of Miami established the Marine Laboratory for the University. They invited researchers and oceanographers to associate themselves with this laboratory. Its three original objectives were teaching, <b>basic</b> <b>research,</b> and applied marine research. The laboratory focused on subjects specific to the tropical environment. Initially, the Marine Lab was located in a private boathouse on an estate on Belle Isle in Miami Beach, Florida. In 1945, when the boathouse became structurally unsafe, the lab moved to a converted apartment building in Coral Gables, Florida near the main campus.|$|E
5|$|Rosetta@home is a {{distributed}} computing project for protein structure prediction on the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) platform, {{run by the}} Baker laboratory at the University of Washington. Rosetta@home aims to predict protein–protein docking and design new proteins {{with the help of}} about sixty thousand active volunteered computers processing at over 210 teraFLOPS on average as of July 29, 2016. Foldit, a Rosetta@Home videogame, aims to reach these goals with a crowdsourcing approach. Though much of the project is oriented toward <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> to improve the accuracy and robustness of proteomics methods, Rosetta@home also does applied research on malaria, Alzheimer's disease, and other pathologies.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{still early}} in his {{surgical}} career, Negus took {{a different approach to}} that which was common at the time. Rather than be apprenticed to a leading surgeon in his ENT (ear, nose and throat) speciality, he undertook <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> on the structure of the larynx that would lead to a higher degree in 1924 and the publication of books and papers on the topic in later years. While engaged in this research, Negus continued his work at King's College Hospital, being appointed junior surgeon in 1924. It was during this period, following his return from the USA, that Negus both promoted the methods and tools he had seen used in Philadelphia by Jackson, and worked to improve the designs of the endoscopes and other equipment used in ENT surgery. These instruments, developed in collaboration with the Genito-Urinary Company of London, included laryngoscopes, bronchoscopes (such as the Negus bronchoscope) and oesophagoscopes. Other surgical innovations developed by Negus included an operating table (known as the King's College table), and a speaking valve for use in tracheotomy tubes. He also helped develop strategies for treatments of throat cancer to aid the choice between surgery and radiotherapy.|$|E

5|$|During Pettit's tenure, the Institute progressed {{into the}} top tier of {{technological}} education institutions. Under his leadership, Tech's research budget surpassed the $100 million mark {{for the first time}} in its history. Thomas E. Stelson was Georgia Tech's Vice President for Research from 1974 to 1988. Faced with a longstanding cultural war over the relative merits of <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> versus applied research, Stelson emphasized the importance of both. An increased focus on research activities allowed more funding for academics, which allowed the school's ranking to start a long and continuing rise from that of the 20s. Stelson simultaneously served as the interim director of the Georgia Tech Research Institute from 1975 to 1976, during which time he reorganized the station into eight semi-autonomous laboratories in order to allow each to develop a specialization and clientele—a model that GTRI retains (with slight modifications) to this day.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} {{focus on}} Women's Rights in the United States during the 1980s {{focused attention on}} the fact that many drugs being prescribed for women had never actually been tested in women of child-bearing potential, and that there was a relative paucity of <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> into women's health. In response to this the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created the Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) in 1990 to address these inequities. In 1993 the National Institutes of Health Revitalisation Act officially reversed US policy by requiring NIH funded phase III clinical trials to include women. This resulted in an increase in women recruited into research studies. The next phase was the specific funding of large scale epidemiology studies and clinical trials focussing on women's health such as the Women's Health Initiative (1991), the largest disease prevention study conducted in the US. Its role was to study the major causes of death, disability and frailty in older women. Despite this apparent progress, women remain underepresented. In 2006 women accounted for less than 25% of clinical trials published in 2004, A follow up study by the same authors five years later found little evidence of improvement. Another study found between 10–47% of women in heart disease clinical trials, despite the prevalence of heart disease in women. Lung cancer {{is the leading cause of}} cancer death amongst women, but while the number of women enrolled in lung cancer studies is increasing, they are still far less likely to be enrolled than men.|$|E
