5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Washington Naval Treaty, Italy was {{permitted}} to retain Regina Elena and her three sisters. The Italian Navy could have kept the ships in service indefinitely, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be replaced by new battleships under the normal practice of the Treaty system. Nevertheless, she was stricken from the naval register on 16 February 1923 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Ali Aaltonen was {{replaced}} by Eero Haapalainen. He in turn was displaced by the Eino Rahja, Adolf Taimi and Evert Eloranta triumvirate. The last Red Guard commander in chief was Kullervo Manner. Some talented men with a high sense of responsibility such as Hugo Salmela in Tampere rose up to take the lead, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{change the course of}} the war. The Reds achieved some local victories, as they retreated from southern Finland toward Russia, e.g. against German troops in the fierce Battle of Syrjäntaka on 28–29 April in Tuulos.|$|E

5|$|Although {{late and}} over-budget the {{decision}} to cancel the MRA4 was controversial as the remaining airframes had all been near completion. It {{has been reported that}} following the retirement of the Nimrod MR2 (in March 2010.), Russian submarines have been able to travel past the UK in international waters, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be tracked {{because of the lack of}} suitable aircraft. In November and early December 2014 four maritime patrol aircraft operated by France, Canada and the United States were based at RAF Lossiemouth to attempt to locate a Russian submarine which had been spotted in British territorial waters off west Scotland.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, {{the success of}} deep-bore {{electric}} trains on the Underground suggested that local services out of London could also be electrified. Following the war, the GER needed more capacity out of Liverpool Street as it was at capacity (serving almost 230,000 passengers daily in 1921), <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> afford electrification. They considered high powered and high tractive steam locomotives including the GER Class A55 as a possible alternative, but these were rejected because of high track loadings.|$|E
5|$|The song {{at the end}} of the show, {{written by}} Ken Keeler, is a parody of various Bond themes. Keeler {{originally}} wrote it to be three seconds longer and sound more like the Goldfinger theme, but the final version was shorter and the lyrics were sped up. The writers wanted the song to be sung by Shirley Bassey, who sang several Bond themes, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> get her to record the part.|$|E

5|$|After their {{conquest of}} Pasir Panjang Ridge, the Japanese {{proceeded}} to march towards {{the city of}} Singapore for their final decisive thrust against remaining Allied forces there. Perched on a hill (near present Keppel Country Club) along Pasir Panjang Road, the escaped Malay and British soldiers had gathered together and waited patiently to ambush the Japanese convoy heading towards the city. Using mounted Bofors guns, they let loose deluge of gunshots causing the Japanese to scramble for cover. The Japanese tanks attempted to move forward to engage the enemy <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> advance due to the sea of dead and wounded bodies blocking its way. About 100 Japanese soldiers were killed during the ambush before the Anglo-Malay force retreated {{to the city to}} join their fellow men for their final stand against the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Four of {{the twelve}} LCPRs had been damaged. Three were soon repaired, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be risked further, for without them, the {{reconnaissance}} force could not be evacuated. The emergency plan provided for an APD to enter the harbour and take troops off from a jetty but this would clearly be a desperate measure indeed. Over the next four hours, the boats continued to make trips to the beach, but only when it was believed destroyers had suppressed enemy fire. Heavy rain made it safer by reducing visibility. The last destroyer was unloaded at 12:50. By this time, the navy had lost two men dead and three wounded.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's armies again {{broke into}} the Ottoman Empire, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{recapture}} Chilia or Cetatea Albǎ. The Tatars of the Great Horde invaded southern Moldavia, but Stephen defeated them {{with the support of}} the Crimean Tatars in 1502. He also sent reinforcements to Hungary to fight against the Ottomans. By then, however, the treaty with Poland was no longer enforced, prompting Stephen to recapture Pocuția in 1502. Although Alexander of Lithuania was by then the new King of Poland, no understanding could be reached between him and Stephen, and the two became enemies. At around that time, Luca Arbore, acting either as Stephen's envoy or on his own, stated a Moldavian claim to Halych and other towns of the Ruthenian Voivodeship. Hungary and the Ottoman Empire concluded a new peace treaty on 22 February 1503, which also included Moldavia. Thereafter Stephen again paid a yearly tribute to the Ottomans.|$|E

5|$|The dreaded North Vietnamese wet season {{offensive}} (Campaign Z) {{began on}} 17 December 1971. The multi-division offensive was commanded by Major General Le Trong Tan, who had commanded the PAVN counteroffensive against Operation Lam Son 719. Once again the communists rolled across the Plain of Jars {{and to the}} outskirts of Long Tieng. This time however, they had brought along a battery of 130mm artillery, which proceeded to pummel the defenders. By 17 January 1972, reinforcement by Unity troops and strikes by B-52s had driven the PAVN from the high ground surrounding the valley, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be pushed out of the area. General Tan then shifted the focus of his forces to the southwest and seized Sam Thong on 18 March. The fighting around Long Tieng did not cease until 28 April.|$|E
5|$|On September 29, Hay ordered Colonel George E. Newman—commander of the 1st Brigade—to {{place the}} 1st Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment and the 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment, in the {{northern}} portion of Long Nguyen. On the next day, Colonel Frank E. Blazey, commander of the 3rd Brigade, was ordered to deploy the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment and the 2nd Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment to the southern half of the area. In {{the early stages of}} Shenandoah II, U.S. forces only made a few contacts with the Viet Cong. On October 2, a South Vietnamese unit operating east of Highway 13 near Chon Thanh made significant contact with a large Viet Cong formation and absorbed heavy casualties. Enemy documents obtained by the South Vietnamese indicated they had clashed with a battalion-sized unit from the Viet Cong 272nd Regiment, sent to attack Chon Thanh in order to cover the movement of the 271st Regiment into the Long Nguyen area. Early in October, Viet Cong soldiers of the 271st Regiment had arrived in Long Nguyen <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> obtain their much-needed food supplies, as a result of allied search-and-destroy operations which had created significant food shortages for Viet Cong units in the region.|$|E
5|$|One of Groves' early {{problems}} {{was to find}} a director for Project Y, the group that would design and build the bomb. The obvious choice was one of the three laboratory heads, Urey, Lawrence, or Compton, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be spared. Compton recommended Oppenheimer, who was already intimately familiar with the bomb design concepts. However, Oppenheimer had little administrative experience, and, unlike Urey, Lawrence, and Compton, had not won a Nobel Prize, which many scientists felt that the head of such an important laboratory should have. There were also concerns about Oppenheimer's security status, as many of his associates were Communists, including his brother, Frank Oppenheimer; his wife, Kitty; and his girlfriend, Jean Tatlock. A long conversation on a train in October 1942 convinced Groves and Nichols that Oppenheimer thoroughly understood the issues involved in setting up a laboratory in a remote area and should be appointed as its director. Groves personally waived the security requirements and issued Oppenheimer a clearance on 20 July 1943.|$|E

5|$|The Yankees {{immediately}} {{took advantage}} of Sherdel {{in the top of}} the tenth inning. Koenig led things off by singling into left field. Sherdel threw a wild pitch to Ruth, and Koenig advanced to second base. Ruth then walked, and Meusel followed with a sacrifice bunt straight to pitcher Sherdel. Meusel was out at first base, but Ruth and Koenig were safe at second and third base, respectively. Gehrig was intentionally walked, loading the bases. Lazzeri hit a fly ball to left field, and Koenig tagged up on the play to score a run and give the Yankees a one-run lead. Mike Gazella, in place of Joe Dugan at third base, was hit by a pitch from Sherdel. With the bases loaded again, Severeid popped up to second baseman Rogers Hornsby to end the Yankee rally. The Cardinals got a single from Thevenow in the bottom of the tenth inning, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> score any runs. The game ended with the Yankees winning by a score of 3–2. Both Pennock and Sherdel pitched ten-inning complete games. Sherdel gave up nine hits and two earned runs, while walking five and striking out two. Pennock finished the game giving up just seven hits and two runs, while striking out four batters.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 8:45am. While {{the damage to}} Mont Blanc was not severe, it toppled barrels that broke open and flooded the deck with benzol that quickly flowed into the hold. As Imos engines kicked in, she quickly disengaged, which created sparks inside Mont-Blancs hull. These ignited the vapours from the benzol. A fire started at the water line and travelled quickly {{up the side of}} the ship as the benzol spewed out from crushed drums on Mont-Blancs decks. The fire quickly became uncontrollable. Surrounded by thick black smoke, and fearing she would explode almost immediately, the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. A growing number of Halifax citizens gathered on the street or stood at the windows of their homes or businesses to watch the spectacular fire. The frantic crew of Mont-Blanc shouted from their two lifeboats to some of the other vessels that their ship was about to explode, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be heard above the noise and confusion. As the lifeboats made their way across the harbour to the Dartmouth shore, the abandoned ship continued to drift and beached herself at Pier 6 near the foot of Richmond street.|$|E
5|$|The {{last three}} years the Priestleys spent in Britain were a time of {{political}} upheaval and the persecution they experienced led to their eventual emigration to the United States. During the Birmingham Riots of 1791, which began on {{the second anniversary of}} the storming of the Bastille {{in the wake of the}} conservative British reaction against the French revolution, the Priestleys' home, Joseph's church, and the homes of many other religious Dissenters were burned. The Priestleys fled Birmingham and attempted to live in London, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> escape the political turmoil. In 1794, they joined the tide of 10,000 emigrants who moved to America—it was the largest emigration from Europe to America until the end of the Napoleonic Wars. The Priestleys left Britain at the beginning of April on the Samson and arrived in New York City on June 4, 1794. Two of their three sons, Joseph, Jr. (eldest) and Harry (youngest), had already emigrated to the United States in August 1793, along with Joseph Priestley's friend, the radical activist Thomas Cooper. Their middle son, William, had moved to America from France, probably early in 1793, following the September massacres of the previous year.|$|E

5000|$|Langdon-Davies {{expressed}} {{admiration for}} Anarchism in Spain. He described anarchists in 1938 as [...] "superb, loveable human beings" [...] <b>but</b> felt <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> arrange an effective defence against the Nationalists.

5|$|The {{remaining}} obstacle was {{a pivotal}} group of pro-life Democrats led by Bart Stupak who were initially reluctant {{to support the}} bill. The group found the possibility of federal funding for abortion significant enough to warrant opposition. The Senate bill had not included language that satisfied their concerns, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> address abortion in the reconciliation bill {{as it would be}} non-budgetary. Instead, Obama issued Executive Order 13535, reaffirming the principles in the Hyde Amendment. This won the support of Stupak and members of his group and assured the bill's passage. The House passed the Senate bill with a 219–212 vote on March 21, 2010, with 34 Democrats and all 178 Republicans voting against it. The next day, Republicans introduced legislation to repeal the bill. Obama signed ACA into law on March 23, 2010. Since passage, Republicans have voted to repeal all or parts of the Affordable Care Act over sixty times; no such attempt by Republicans has been successful. The amendment bill, The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, cleared the House on March 21; the Senate passed it by reconciliation on March 25, and Obama signed it on March 30.|$|E
5|$|Bradford were {{eliminated}} from the FA Cup with a 3–0 defeat to League One side Tranmere Rovers. They returned to league action with two more draws, away to Mansfield Town and Chesterfield, the latter game of which featured Joe Colbeck, who had returned from Darlington early despite his one-month loan spell being originally extended. The following week City signed Willy Topp for £35,000the first time they had paid a transfer fee for a player since Andy Tod in November 2001nearly three months after he first came on trial. City were given two weeks off before their next game, when their home game against Rotherham United on 15 December was postponed because of a frozen pitch. <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{take advantage of the}} extra rest and despite taking the lead against Peterborough United, two second half goals gave Peterborough a 2–1 win and helped them to second in the league. The highest attendance of the season for a League Two game attended City's next game on Boxing Day against Lincoln City. It {{was the first time the}} two teams had met in the league at Valley Parade since the fire of 1985 and the crowd of 15,510 observed a minute silence and wreath-laying ceremony before the game. Peter Thorne gave City the lead, and despite an equalier from Lincoln, Barry Conlon secured a 2–1 win for Bradford in the last minute. The 2007 calendar year finished with another home game, but this time City lost 3–1 to Hereford United.|$|E
5|$|However, {{as soon as}} the {{soldiers}} from the 30th and 33rd Ranger Battalions arrived at the landing zone, they were quickly overwhelmed by the Viet Cong in a deadly ambush. The entire 30th Ranger Battalion was then committed to join the attack, but they too did not initially succeed in penetrating the strong Viet Cong defensive lines. Several more companies of the Rangers then arrived for an attack from multiple directions. Two companies of the 33rd Ranger Battalion advanced from the northeast. One of them came to the outskirts of the village, but was unable to break through the enemy defenses. The other one, trying to outflank the enemy, had been lured into a kill zone in open terrain and were quickly obliterated in an ambush by the three VC battalions using heavy weapons. The two companies suffered a 70 percent casualty rate, and survivors were forced to retreat to the nearby Catholic church. The 30th Rangers had more success by assaulting from the western direction and succeeded in fighting their way into the village, aided by local residents. It however also suffered heavy losses, with the battalion commander and his American adviser severely wounded. The local civilians in Bình Giã retrieved weapons and ammunition from the dead Rangers, and hid the wounded government soldiers from the Viet Cong. The 38th Ranger Battalion, on the other hand, landed on the battlefield unopposed by the Viet Cong, and they immediately advanced on Bình Giã from the south. Soldiers from the 38th Rangers spent the whole day fighting, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> break through their enemies' defences to link up with the survivors hiding in the church, and fell back after calling in mortar fire to decimate Viet Cong fighters moving to encircle them.|$|E
