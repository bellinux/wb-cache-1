40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a basis for}} exchange rate policy coordination for three countries, China, Japan, and Korea. We suggest that in managing the exchange rate, the three countries should establish the common rules for exchange rate intervention and propose that each country should use the optimum <b>basket</b> <b>rate</b> as the target exchange rate. In this {{paper we propose a}} <b>basket</b> <b>rate</b> formula for each country and derive the optimum weights for the currencies in the basket. To find the optimum currency weights, we minimize the variance of the percentage changes in the target exchange rate. Through empirical analysis, we get the result that the actual exchange rate of each country tends to fall within a range of plus- minus 3 percent around its target exchange rate.

40|$|In October 1991 Poland has {{established}} a crawling peg regime in which the zloty is tied to a currency basket and devalued with a monthly rate of crawl. If the monetary authorities are successful in defending the crawling peg the <b>basket</b> <b>rate</b> measured in Polish zloty {{is supposed to be}} stationary. Furthermore, a stable long-run relationship between the zloty-U. S. dollar rate and the basket's value expressed in U. S. dollar is expected to exist. The results of the unit root and cointegration analysis indicate that the monetary authorities have been able to defend the crawling peg for the sample periods under study, although it seems that not all requirements of the exchange rate regime have been met. The foreign exchange markets, however, have not supported the relationships derived from the crawling peg system after the introduction of the free floating system in April 2000.

40|$|In {{the face}} of huge balance of {{payments}} surpluses and internal inflationary pressures, China {{has been in a}} classic conflict between internal and external balance under its dollar currency peg. Over the longer term, China’s large, modernizing, and diverse economy will need exchange rate flexibility and, eventually, convertibility with open capital markets. A feasible and attractive exit strategy from the essentially fixed RMB exchange rate would be a two-stage approach, consistent with the steps already taken since July 2005, but going beyond them. First, establish a limited trading band for the RMB relative to a basket of major trading partner currencies. Set the band so that it allows some initial revaluation of the RMB against the dollar, manage the <b>basket</b> <b>rate</b> within the band if necessary, and widen the band over time as domestic foreign exchange markets develop. Second, put on hold ad hoc measures of financial account liberalization. They will be less helpful for relieving exchange rate pressures once the RMB/basket rate is allowed to move flexibly within a band, and they are best postponed until domestic foreign exchange markets develop further, the exchange rate is fully flexible, and the domestic financial system has been strengthened and placed on a market-oriented basis.

40|$|This study uses two-way quoted data {{on major}} and nonmajor {{currencies}} {{to test the}} exchange rate dynamics. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the arbitrage and the spread in triangular foreign exchange trades. There is only one possible triangle when a bilateral exchange rate equals its trilateral rate. Otherwise, any third currency would potentially create arbitrage opportunities. Empirical testing evidence supports that small but possibly exploitable profitable arbitrage has significantly occurred over the very short haul of uncertainty and turbulence. In other words, we are convinced that the bilateral exchange rate could be diverged from one common currency side of the trilateral <b>basket</b> <b>rates</b> until markets function efficiently. This helps in better explaining foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, we find that the currency correlating decreases slightly but the volatility increases over time, as we expected. ...|$|R

However, direction of trade and synchronisation of business cycle of oil exporters suggest that there is no single "ideal" external anchor among the major international currencies. Model simulations - parameterised for an oil exporting economy - indicate that a currency basket is generally preferable to a single currency peg, especially when some weight is placed by the policy maker on output stabilisation. Only when inflation becomes the only policy objective and external trade is mostly conducted in one currency that a peg to a single currency becomes optimal.

Here, we assessed basket cell “hairiness ” in 37 ET (32 cerebellar ET; 5 Lewy body variant ET [LBVET]), 21 non-disease control, and 48 disease control brains using a semiquantitative scale.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impacts of}} the 2005 shift in Russian exchange rate policies from single-currency to bi-currency basket targeting on domestic interest rates and sovereign risk premium dynamics. The policy shift disconnected domestic interest rates from US dollar-denominated interest rates, replacing them with a growing positive relationship with the dual-currency basket (USD-EUR) adopted by the Central Bank of Russia, {{as well as a}} synthetic interest rate composed of the US dollar LIBOR and the euro LIBOR. The paper also considers the insulating properties of Russian basket targeting policies during the recent global liquidity crisis. I present evidence that the Russian MosIBOR rate was negatively related to the US dollar LIBOR rate and positively related to the synthetic USD-EUR rate during the "decoupling" stage of the crisis. Even with the steep quantitative easing of the US Fed during this period, the finding suggests the Russian money market was more in sync with the monetary policies of the euro area. The central conclusion here is that, in conditions of managed floating exchange rate policies and liberalized capital accounts, the relationship between a country's domestic interest rates and their foreign counterparts depends on the de facto operating target of the central bank of this country, whether it is a single currency or a <b>basket.</b> exchange <b>rate</b> policy; <b>basket</b> targeting; sovereign CDS; decoupling...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is the price {{calibration}} of basket default swap from Japanese market data. The value of this instruments depend on the number of factors including credit rating of the obligors in the <b>basket,</b> recovery <b>rates,</b> intensity of default, basket size and the correlation of obligors in the basket. A fundamental part of the pricing framework is the estimation of the instantaneous default probabilities for each obligor. Because default probabilities depend on the credit quality of the considered obligor, well-calibrated credit curves are a main ingredient for constructing default times. The calibration of credit curves take into account internal information on credit migrations and default history. We refer to Japan Credit Rating Agency to obtain rating transition matrix and cumulative default rates. Default risk is often considered as a rare-event and then, many studies have shown that many distributions have fatter tails than those captured by the normal distribution. Subsequently, the choice of copula and the choice of procedures for rare-event simulation govern the pricing of basket credit derivatives.

We consider using Gaussian copula and t-student copula and study their impact on basket credit derivative prices. We will present an applicatio...|$|R

40|$|With {{the recent}} formal {{inclusion}} of the Renminbi (RMB) into the IMF’s Special Drawing Right (SDR) currency basket, prospects for further internationalization of the RMB are improving. However, as China attempts to simultaneously undergo an economic transition into a more balanced growth model, and the internationalization of its currency, pressures are mounting from the impossible trinity. The latter {{is based on the}} Mundell-Flemming model. The latter posits a policy-choice problem in which a country cannot simultaneously have unfettered capital movement, an independent monetary policy, and a fixed exchange rate system. Naturally, three baskets of policy combinations are possible. Historical events such as the Asian financial crisis (1997 - 1998) have demonstrated that countries are strictly bound by the impossible trinity. The paper posits that China should opt for the policy basket of a fully liberalized capital account, fully liberalized interest rates, and maintain its current <b>basket</b> peg exchange <b>rate</b> regime but eventually allow for a greater spread. The policy sequence should begin with the liberalization of the interest rates while maintaining the current level of capital controls. Once adequate time has been given to allow the domestic financial and economic system to adjust and consolidate itself, the liberalization of the capital account should be the next goal. Finally, the <b>basket</b> peg exchange <b>rate</b> regime should be allowed a greater float. While the interest rates and the capital account are undergoing liberalization, the exchange rate should operate as a policy tool so as to minimize shocks to the domestic economic system. The policy basket and sequence have been chosen because they are conducive to a risk-averse economic transition from the current export-led growth model.

The results suggest that past consumer price inflation generally led to currency devaluation, measured as a decline {{in the value of the}} currency in terms of the trade-weighted nominal effective exchange rate. The effect of inflation on devaluation, however, became weaker following the financial reforms undertaken in the early 1980 s. The effect of devaluation on inflation was not significant, and this result remained robust throughout the sample period.

40|$|Based on the {{observed}} behavior of monetary aggregates and exchange rates, we classify inflation-stabilization episodes into two categories: de facto exchange rate-based stabilizations (ERBS) and non-ERBS. Unlike the standard de jure ERBS {{studied in the}} literature, de facto ERBS encompass {{cases in which the}} central bank intervenes in the foreign exchange market but does not preannounce the use of an exchange rate anchor. The number of the de facto ERBS is twice as large as that of de jure ERBS. Output dynamics during disinflation do not differ significantly between these two groups. We conclude that empirical studies on the effects of exchange rate anchors must seek to disentangle the effects of their announcement from those related to their role in the remonetization process.

40|$|Substantially {{scaling up}} of aid flows will require {{development}} partners to address many issues, including {{the impact of}} higher aid flows on: the competitiveness of aid recipients; the management of fiscal and monetary policy; the delivery of public services; behavioral incentives; {{and the rate of}} growth of the economy. Other issues will include the appropriate sequencing of aid-financed investments; balancing alternative expenditure priorities; the implications for fiscal and budget sustainability; and exit strategies from donor funding. Donors will need to ensure greater long-term predictability and reduced short-term volatility of aid. The international financial institutions can {{play a critical role in}} helping countries address these scaling-up issues.
