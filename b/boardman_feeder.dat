50|$|A nuc is {{extremely}} vulnerable, as it possesses {{in some cases}} less than {{a tenth of the}} workers in a normal colony.Nucs are almost always fed using a <b>boardman</b> <b>feeder</b> or frame feeder.Feeding allows the worker bees to remain in the nuc, acting as nurse bees for developing brood.Because of their small population, Nucs are vulnerable to robbing, in which a stronger hive steals all the nectar, honey, or syrup from a weaker hive.The bees from a robbing hive will kill any bees that defend the nuc.Robbing can lead to starvation in days.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} types of energy feeding (sugar syrup, inverted sugar and juice of sugar-cane) on beeswax production and its economic feasibility are evaluated. Twenty beehives of Africanized Apis mellifera were selected, and five were used for each type of feeding. The treatments were T 1 (sugar-cane juice), T 2 (sugar syrup) and T 3 (inverted sugar). Feedings was provided by <b>Boardman</b> <b>feeders</b> and the amount was adjusted according to consumption. A layer of beeswax was manually set up into the honeybee nest and beeswax built area was measured weekly. Total reducing sugar, calorimetry, dry matter and ashes of all feedings were analyzed. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance with Tukeyâ€™s test to determine differences among averages. The average consumption of inverted sugar was significantly lower than that of other treatments. The highest beeswax production average occurred in the sugar syrup treatment. The highest average of ashes, dry matter and reducing sugar occurred, respectively, in sugar-cane juice, inverted sugar and sugar syrup. Sugar syrup may be an alternative energy source for beeswax production, although sugar-cane juice may be more profitable. ...|$|R
