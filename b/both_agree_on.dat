500|$|With {{each new}} treaty, {{the powers of}} the Parliament, in terms of its role in the Union's {{legislative}} procedures, have expanded. The procedure which has slowly become dominant is the [...] "ordinary legislative procedure" [...] (previously named [...] "codecision procedure"), which provides an equal footing between Parliament and Council. In particular, under the procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the Council which can only become law if <b>both</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> a text, which they do (or not) through successive readings up to a maximum of three. In its first reading, Parliament may send amendments to the Council which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a [...] "common position". That position may either be approved by Parliament, [...] or it may reject the text by an absolute majority, causing it to fail, or it may adopt further amendments, also by an absolute majority. If the Council does not approve these, then a [...] "Conciliation Committee" [...] is formed. The Committee is composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs who seek to agree a compromise. Once a position is agreed, it has to be approved by Parliament, by a simple majority. This is also aided by Parliament's mandate as the only directly democratic institution, which has given it leeway to have greater control over legislation than other institutions, for example over its changes to the Bolkestein directive in 2006.|$|E

50|$|This {{refers to}} the {{selection}} of either being connected with a spouse and acting as one or being dependent and acting on one's own terms.
