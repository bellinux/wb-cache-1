5|$|Another {{portion of}} modern VT 14, between East Brookfield and Williamstown center, {{was to be}} {{improved}} by another turnpike corporation, the Williamstown Center Turnpike, which was chartered on November 14, 1803. The charter provided that the road <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the state after having been in operation for 25 years (later amended to 40 years). The company, however, did not do anything in its {{first two years of}} existence and only began laying out the road in 1805.|$|E
5|$|An {{elaborate}} bureaucracy {{was created}} to regulate German imports of raw materials and finished goods {{with the intention of}} eliminating foreign competition in the German marketplace and improving the nation's balance of payments. The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles. As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low, in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit-sharing agreement with IG Farben, guaranteeing them a 5 percent return on capital invested in their synthetic oil plant at Leuna. Any profits in excess of that amount would <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as the excess profits by then being generated had to be given to the government.|$|E

5|$|An {{original}} typescript of {{the laws}} signed by Hitler was found by the US Army's Counter-Intelligence Corps in 1945. It {{ended up in the}} possession of General George S. Patton, who kept it, in violation of orders that such finds should <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the government. During a visit to Los Angeles in 1945, he handed it over to the Huntington Library, where it was stored in a bomb-proof vault. The library revealed the existence of the document in 1999, and sent it on permanent loan to the Skirball Cultural Center, which placed it on public display. The document was transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration in Washington in August 2010.|$|E
5|$|As {{it entered}} Cleveland County, the National Weather Service and Storm Prediction Center {{activated}} emergency procedures, preparing to evacuate staff and others {{present at the}} facility {{in the event that}} the supercell should turn right, placing areas surrounding the Norman campus in the tornado's path (under NOAA protocol in situations posing a danger to personnel at local Weather Forecast Offices and related guidance centers, responsibility over the issuance of warnings and statements on the unfolding outbreak would have been transferred to the nearest NWS Forecast Office, based in Tulsa, while the SPC's forecasting responsibilities would <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the 557th Weather Wing at Offutt Air Force Base). The supercell, however, continued on a northeastward track, sparing the Norman area.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, as the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad {{continued}} {{the project of}} eliminating at-grade crossings between streets and railroads, the Montclair Branch was the next to receive the structural change. Bloomfield criticized the Lackawanna railroad for making a disgrace of the community. The railroad proposed using $700,000 (1911 USD) of funds to construct a brand new station at Watsessing Avenue along with a new downtown Bloomfield Station. The cost of elevating and depressing the railroad came up to about $20,000 (1911 USD) for the Lackawanna. This contract by the railroad and township was approved after negotiations dating back to 1908. The negotiations included a park to be built between both stations {{on both sides of}} the railroad. The park land cost the township $50,000 to buy for the construction, and it was to <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Essex County Park Commission.|$|E
50|$|The Toul {{detachment}} was discontinued on 1 September 1959 {{and replaced}} by Detachment 7, 7514th Support Group when Luneville-Chenevieres <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the United States Army. The detachment from Toul maintained security on the base. Army artillery units utilized the base until 1964 when it <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the French Army.|$|R
50|$|In 1960 Moriarty Air Force Station was {{transferred}} to the Federal Aviation Administration pending inactivation of the 768th, which was discontinued on 1 June 1961.

5|$|In 1995, {{the direct}} carpool lane ramps between I-5 and SR55 were completed; {{these were the}} first in Orange County. The year also saw further {{widening}} of SR55 between SR22 and McFadden Avenue. Between 1996 and 2002, the fifth lane in both directions was constructed between I-5 and SR91, funded with a sales tax of half a cent approved by Measure M. In April 2007, the Orange County Transportation Authority approved funds to study the feasibility of extending the Costa Mesa Freeway south to 17th Street via tunnels or flyover ramps. The segment of SR55 from Finley Street to the Newport Channel bridge was legally authorized to <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the city of Newport Beach in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days after}} its premiere in Milan, Cannibal Holocaust was confiscated under {{the orders of}} a local magistrate, and Ruggero Deodato {{was arrested and charged}} with obscenity. As all copies were to <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the authorities, the film was {{distributed}} internationally via subterfuge. In January 1981, during the film's theatrical run in France, the magazine Photo suggested that certain deaths depicted in the film were real, which would have made Cannibal Holocaust a snuff film. Following the publication of the Photo article, the charges against Deodato were amended to include murder. The courts believed that the actors who portrayed the missing film crew and the native actress featured in the impalement scene were killed for the camera.|$|E
5|$|The Navy was {{reasonably}} {{pleased with}} the first ship, Bayan, and decided to order another cruiser {{after the start of}} the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904. Russian shipyards were still unavailable, so the Navy decided to simply order a repeat with minor modifications based on war experience. This was an attempt to minimize the work load on the Naval Technical Committee (Morskoi tekhnicheskii komitet), but they proved to require more attention than planned and a contract was not signed until 20 April 1905. The contract specified that all drawings would <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> allow for the construction of two identical ships in St. Petersburg, using newly available slipways. These changes generally added weight and the armor was reduced in thickness to compensate, although the change from Harvey armor to more resistant Krupp armor meant that there was little actual loss in protection.|$|E

5|$|The act {{provided}} for {{a maximum of}} 40,000 medals, to be struck at the Philadelphia Mint, from design models prepared by the Norse-American Centennial Commission. Medals would <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> a designated agent of the commission on payment {{of the cost of}} producing them. They were to be made subject to the provisions of section 52 of the Coinage Act of 1873. That section permitted medals of a national character to be struck at the Philadelphia Mint, but forbade Mint personnel from making dies for private medals, and was enacted after Philadelphia Mint Chief Coiner Franklin Peale had for some years run a private medals business on Mint premises, prior to his firing in 1854.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} Malta {{returned}} {{control of the}} central Mediterranean to Britain and was {{an important step in}} the invasion and liberation of Egypt from French rule in 1801. An essential condition of the Treaty of Amiens in the same year, which brought an end to the French Revolutionary War, was that the British leave Malta. Russian Tsar Alexander I had a long standing claim to the island as titular head of the Knights of St. John, and demanded that it <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Russian control before agreeing any alliance with Britain. Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger flatly refused, and the Napoleonic Wars with France began soon afterwards, in part due to the failure of Britain to comply with this clause of the treaty. The island subsequently remained in British hands until its independence in 1964.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Livestock Conservancy began {{investigating}} the Carolina Marsh Tacky {{to see if}} it was truly a descendant of colonial Spanish stock, and during the organization's initial field investigations it was found that many surviving members of the breed fit the physical type for Spanish horses. In 2007, the organization partnered with the Equus Survival Trust in a project to preserve the breed that included DNA sampling, the creation of a new studbook and mapping the genetics of the breed. The Conservancy participated in the rescue of the Wilbur Cruce strain of Colonial Spanish horse when the area in which it lived was to <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> a land conservation program that required domestic animals to be removed. After the rescue, a conservation plan was developed for the animals and small breeding groups of horses were placed with responsible parties. It also assisted in formulating a conservation and breeding strategy for a strain of Colonial Spanish horses from Santa Cruz Island in California. This support helped the horses to become recognized and registrable with the Colonial Spanish registry.|$|E

5|$|Little {{progress}} {{had been}} made on the memorial by 1926. While some debate occurred in respect to the form that the memorial would take, {{the focus of the}} discussions concerned the location of the memorial, and this centred on the future of Government House {{and the role of the}} Governor. A number of left-wing politicians argued that the grounds of Government House should <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the State and used to build the memorial while the conservatives desired to retain the status quo. By 1925 the National War Memorial committee was prepared to accept the Government House grounds as the site of the memorial, but they delayed making an announcement. This proved to be fortuitous, as legal issues prevented the plan from going ahead. Instead a portion of the grounds, located at the corner of North Terrace and Kintore Avenue, was put aside for the purpose. (The plan to move the Governor and to use the grounds as part of a larger war memorial were revisited, over 80 years later, in 2007).|$|E
