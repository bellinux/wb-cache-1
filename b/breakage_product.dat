40|$|A {{high voltage}} pulse (HVP) {{breakage}} model was {{developed as a}} general modelling structure to represent the three HVP breakage indices: body breakage probability (the D 1 -model), body <b>breakage</b> <b>product</b> fineness (the D 2 -model), and body <b>breakage</b> <b>product</b> pre-weakening degree (the D 3 -model). Relations between the HVP breakage indices and HVP pre-concentration characterisation curves were established. The preliminary result indicated that the HVP breakage model {{has the potential to}} predict the recovery of valuable metals from the calibrated model parameters. A tn-family of curves (tn is defined as cumulative percentage of product passing 1 /n of the initial size) was used to describe the HVP <b>breakage</b> <b>product</b> size distribution. The tn-family of curves can be employed to estimate the product size distribution from the predicted t 10 values by the D 2 -model...|$|E
40|$|It {{is quite}} common to {{encounter}} discrete element method (DEM) simulations of mills that present images of the motion of grinding media, summaries of tangential and normal forces, and mill power. The usefulness of this data is questioned, with respect to modelling breakage. This work presents hypotheses of how the DEM simulations {{can be used as}} input to comminution modelling, and this guides the data logging and analysis requirements. Techniques are proposed for collecting and using this data in a manner useful for predicting breakage in a comminution device. Individual particle impact histories of contact angle, force, and impulse are required to realistically model breakage. It is argued that the majority of breakage results from cumulative damage, thus it is essential to track individual particle histories to realistically predict the <b>breakage</b> <b>product</b> from a mill. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

At a specific comminution energy level, the t 50 parameter of South Blackwater coal was higher than the t 50 parameter of Ensham coal. A degradation model was developed with several parameters for the coal-handling circuits of Gladstone Port. In the degradation model, the raw data of the non-cushioned curve deviates from the model data after a few initial drops because {{the mass of the}} sample reduces in successive drops and produced more fines...|$|E

40|$|The {{substitution}} of thymine mucleotides (pT) in oligodeoxynucleotides by bromouracil nucleotides (pBU) changes {{the properties of}} the oligonucleotides in two ways: (1) It alters their mobility during DEAE-Cellulose homochromatography 1. (2) It substantially enhances their sensitivity to high temperature hydrolysis under mildly alkaline conditions (pH 8. 9). The resultant breaks occur adjacent to pBU residues and leave terminal phosphates on the <b>breakage</b> <b>products.</b> With more extreme conditions some loss of terminal phosphates can occur. Heating at 100 degrees for 16 hr at pH 8. 9 produces cleavage at about half of the pBU residues with minimal loss of terminal phosphates.

40|$|The {{weathered}} coal {{samples were}} tested by a laser detector computer monitored twin pendulum device {{to measure the}} comminution energy of breakage particles. The single particle breakage tests were conducted with the three particle sizes (- 16. 0 + 13. 2 mm, - 13. 2 + 11. 2 mm, - 11. 2 + 9. 5 mm) of two types of weathered coal at five input energy levels. The results showed a small variation of comminution energy of same size particles when broken at one input energy because the coal sample used for the test is anthracite coal. The specific comminution energy increases linearly with the input energy for different sizes of coal particle.

Three particle sizes (- 16. 0 + 13. 2 mm, - 13. 2 + 11. 2 mm, 0 - 11. 2 + 9. 5 mm) of each coal were tested by a pendulum device at five input energy levels to measure the specific comminution energy. When particles were tested at constant input energy, the variation of comminution energy between the same size broken particles of Ensham coal was minimal, because Ensham coal is a softer and higher friability coal, which absorbs more input energy than harder coal during breakage tests. For different particle sizes, the specific comminution energy increases linearly with the input energy and the fineness of the breakage products increases with the specific comminution energy. The size distribution graphs are curved but approach linearity in the finer region. At a constant input energy, the twin pendulum <b>breakage</b> <b>product</b> {{results show that the}} fineness of the products increases with decrease in particle size and South Blackwater coal produced finer products than the Ensham coal.

The lengths of the <b>breakage</b> <b>products</b> of the DNA treated with HN 2 were compared to the lengths of DNA scission products produced by chemical reactions used for DNA sequence determination. HN 2 was found to create alkali-labile lesions at positions of guanine. The distribution of the guanine modifications was the same for DNA extracted from cells treated with HN 2 and for purified DNA treated with HN 2. However, the extent of damage was at least 2 -fold greater when purified DNA was used as the substrate. Several nitrogen mustard analogues also produced alkali-labile lesions at positions of guanine...|$|R
40|$|To {{maintain}} genome stability, {{the entire}} genome of a eukaryotic cell must be replicated once and only once per cell cycle. In many organisms, multiple overlapping mechanisms block rereplication, but {{the consequences of}} deregulating these mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that disrupting these controls in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae rapidly blocks cell proliferation. Rereplicating cells activate the classical DNA damage-induced checkpoint response, which depends on the BRCA 1 C-terminus checkpoint protein Rad 9. In contrast, Mrc 1, a checkpoint protein required for recognition of replication stress, does not {{play a role in}} the response to rereplication. Strikingly, rereplicating cells accumulate subchromosomal DNA <b>breakage</b> <b>products.</b> These rapid and severe consequences suggest that even limited and sporadic rereplication could threaten the genome with significant damage. Hence, even subtle disruptions in the cell cycle regulation of DNA replication may predispose cells to the genomic instability associated with tumorigenesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{breakage}} {{characteristics of}} a two-component ore in a confined bed was studied in this work in order to predict the breakage behaviour of a multi-component ore from the properties of individual components. Bed compression tests with each single component and blended components at different bulk volumetric ratios were carried out at different volume based specific energies and the bed particle size distributions of each component in the mixtures were measured (through magnetic separation). The experimental {{results show that the}} <b>breakage</b> <b>product</b> size measured by t - the cumulative mass percentage of particles less than 1 / 10 th of the feed size, is linearly proportional to the relative bed porosity reduction, for both single component and multi-component ore. There is a minimum bed porosity reduction to be reached before any breakage occurs and the less competent the ore, the lower the minimum porosity reduction value. Theoretical analysis on bed compression breakage shows that the relationship between product size measured in t and the specific comminution energy (E) is not unique and is dependent on the testing conditions. The analysis shows the importance of testing bed breakage at conditions that are independent of bed configurations. Furthermore, models for predicting the product t and specific comminution energy of multi-component ore from single component compression data are developed. By compressing the particle bed at the set porosity reduction for each component and few multi-component tests, one can predict the mixture product and mixture energy consumption at any mixture ratios without the needs to physically separate the products in the mixture test...|$|E

Additional controls over the intact texture include the ability to vary the proportion of grain inclusions within grains of a different mineral phase and by varying the degree of spatial clustering of grains within the texture. Repeated random 2 D and 3 D sectioning of the 3 D texture to simulate particle production and to calculate their compositions is used to generate outputs comparable to reports from mineral liberation analysis systems; including density distributions, liberation distributions, and particle class distributions. These outputs enable texture parameters to be fitted to corresponding measured liberation data and is demonstrated for a four-mineral sulphide ore, yielding a realistic distribution of particle properties, essential for accurately modelling particle separations...|$|R

Only the ferrous and cupric complexes are capable of generating both single- and double-strand scissions. However, double-strand breakages appear to be dominating lesions in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, especially for copper(II) containing systems.

40|$|The {{majority}} of sporadic carcinomas {{suffer from a}} kind of genetic instability in which chromosome number changes occur together with segmental defects. This means that changes involving intact chromosomes accompany breakage-induced alterations. Whereas the causes of aneuploidy are described in detail, the origins of chromosome breakage in sporadic carcinomas remain disputed. The three main pathways of chromosomal instability (CIN) proposed until now (random breakage, telomere fusion and centromere fission) are largely based on animal models and in vitro experiments, and recent studies revealed several discrepancies between animal models and human cancer. Here, we discuss how the experimental systems translate to human carcinomas and compare the theoretical <b>breakage</b> <b>products</b> to data from patient material and cancer cell lines. The {{majority of}} chromosomal defects in human carcinomas comprises pericentromeric breaks that are captured by healthy telomeres, and only a minor proportion of chromosome fusions {{can be attributed to}} telomere erosion or random breakage. Centromere fission, not telomere erosion, is therefore the most probably trigger of CIN and early carcinogenesis.

40|$|Potato virus X (PVX) {{was among}} the first viruses to be purified. Nonetheless, {{properties}} of the purified virus remain contentious. The literature has been heavily influenced by the concept of a virus as a monopartite entity. Despite the fact that electron micrographs invariably show large proportions of shorter virus particles, the latter are universally ignored. Seven distinct classes of particle lengths were detected. Seven RNA species of approximate sizes 6. 4, 3. 6, 3. 0, 2. 1, 1. 8, 1. 4, and 0. 9 kb were extracted from these purified virus preparations. This study shows clearly that shorter PVX particles are not <b>breakage</b> <b>products</b> and indicates that they may reflect fundamental properties of the genome strategy. Furthermore, other potexviruses have been found to contain many shorter particles, and the level of these particles is stable during purification. PVX is generally believed to consist of particles of single length even though the literature does not confirm this conclusion. The notion of a single particle length appears to reflect historical concepts of what a virus should be rather than what PVX is. This report considers whether shorter rods present in virus preparations of PVX are distinctive products of infection. The problem addressed is significant because if affects conclusions concerning the mechanisms of PVX biosynthesis and replication...|$|R
40|$|To {{elucidate}} yeast chromosome {{structure and}} behavior, {{we examined the}} breakage of entangled chromosomes in DNA topoisomerase II mutants by hybridization to chromosomal DNA resolved by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Our study reveals that large and small chromosomes differ in the nature and distribution of their intertwinings. Probes to large chromosomes (450 kb or larger) detect chromosome breakage, but probes to small chromosomes (380 kb or smaller) reveal no <b>breakage</b> <b>products.</b> Examination of chromosomes with one small arm and one large arm suggests that the two arms behave independently. The acrocentric chromosome XIV breaks only on the long arm, and its preferred region of breakage is approximately 200 kb from the centromere. When the centromere of chromosome XIV is relocated, the preferred region of breakage shifts accordingly. These results suggest that large chromosomes break because they have long arms and small chromosomes do not break because they have small arms. Indeed, a small metacentric chromosome {{can be made to}} break if it is rearranged to form a telocentric chromosome with one long arm or a ring with an "infinitely" long arm. These results suggest a model of chromosomal intertwining in which the length of the chromosome arm prevents intertwinings from passively resolving off the end of the arm during chromosome segregation...|$|R
40|$|Nicks {{within one}} strand of the {{bacteriophage}} T 5 DNA molecule act as “ weak points” for a novel kind mechanical breakage {{that can be}} utilized for “dissecting” the genome. The products from sheared T 5 + DNA include five unique double-stranded segments of the molecule and various combinations of adjacent segments. These specific fragments are not obtained after repair of the nicks with DNA ligase (EC 6. 5. 1. 1). The duplex fragments and most of their single-stranded components have been separated, identified, and mapped by means of agarose gel electrophoresis. Even the complementary strands of the unique fragments separate in agarose gels; hence, there are now three useful classes of DNA fragments available from T 5 : the natural r-strand fragments, their complements from the normally intact l strand, and the corresponding duplex segments. By summing the apparent molecular weights of their single-stranded components, the unique duplex fragments from T 5 + DNA can be assigned molecular weights of approximately 6 × 106 (A), 8 × 106 (B), 11 × 106 (C), 27 × 106 (D), and 30 × 106 (E) {{from left to right}} along the genome. The most abundant overlapping fragments are segments AB (14 × 106) and ABC (26 × 106).

40|$|AbstractBackground: The TATA-binding protein (TBP) {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{components}} of the human TFIID multiprotein complex. It is important in directing the initiation of RNA transcription at a site immediately downstream of the TATA sequence (TATA box) found in many eukaryotic promoters. The crystal structure of TBP complexed with an oligonucleotide containing the TATA box revealed a protein with an approximate two-fold symmetry which apparently has symmetrical interactions with DNA. It is not known how an asymmetric effect involving downstream activation can be produced by an apparent symmetric complex. We set out to examine the state of DNA in the TBP-DNA complex using pluramycin, a small molecular weight probe of DNA accessibility. Results: Binding of TBP to the TATA box facilitates intercalation of pluramycin at a defined site immediately downstream of the TATA sequence through an apparent transient unwinding of the DNA. Pluramycin adducts are detected by the production of DNA strand <b>breakage</b> <b>products</b> upon heating. Incubation of pluramycin with the TBP-DNA complex facilitates the trapping of the specific complex by intercalation. Gel mobility shift and circularization assays reveal that the binding of pluramycin on the 3 ′-side of the TATA box region considerably stabilizes the TBP-DNA complex. Conclusions: We propose that the TBP-DNA-pluramycin ternary complex is a ‘specific’ binding mode in which TBP and pluramycin make compensatory alterations in DNA, accounting for the improved stability of the ternary complex. We also propose a model of the ternary complex that explains the observed asymmetric effect of TBP binding to the TATA box...|$|R
40|$|Acyl-carrier-protein (ACP) is the {{principal}} transporter of fatty acids, coordinating acyl-transfer among a vast network of diverse enzymes and biochemical processes. ACP association with protein partners {{is thought to be}} exceedingly transient. This paradigm has posed challenges for understanding the molecular basis for acyl-delivery and dissociation. During biosynthesis of the lipid A component (endotoxin) of lipopolysaccharides, ACP shuttles acyl-intermediates thioester-linked to its 4 '-phosphopantetheine arm among four acyltransferases: LpxA, LpxD, LpxL, and LpxM. LpxA and LpxD are essential cytoplasmic enzymes, which not only provide an excellent model system to study ACP-based interaction, but also offer an important therapeutic target for development of novel antibiotics. The current dissertation reports the crystal structures of three forms of Escherichia coli ACP engaging LpxD, which represent stalled substrate and <b>breakage</b> <b>products</b> along the reaction coordinate. The structures reveal the intricate interactions at the interface that optimally position ACP for acyl-delivery and directly involve the pantetheinyl group. Conformational differences among the stalled ACPs provide the molecular basis for the association-dissociation process. An unanticipated conformational shift of 4 '-phosphopantetheine groups within the LpxD catalytic chamber reveals an unprecedented role of ACP in product release. Moreover, the crystal structure of E. coli LpxA in complex with one form of ACP (holo-ACP) is presented. The structure reveals three molecules of holo-ACP localize to the C-terminal domain of the LpxA homotrimer, and shows the functional role of this domain is two-fold: ACP recognition and nucleotide binding of UDP-GlcNAc. A comparison with the LpxD:ACP complexes uncovers that ACP utilizes different surface residues for recognition even amongst closely related acyltransferases, yet still relies on "electrostatic steering" for docking to its enzyme partner. Insights gleaned from the presented structures have provided not only a better understanding of ACP interaction with acyltransferases, but also has identified the "drugable molecular landscape" for the development of novel antibiotics against infective bacteria.

Research design: A pragmatic research philosophy was used in a multi-case approach to determine the association between business management practices and stock-outs. The unit of analysis of the study is the highest turnover outlets. Findings: The results revealed that retailers base demand forecasting on judgement and naïve or simple moving average forecast methods. There is little consideration of variability, lead time or targeted customer service levels when determining optimal inventory levels. <b>Product</b> <b>breakages</b> are common, implying that data inaccuracies and stock-outs are highly probable.

Interaction between components is reflected by the comparison of specific energy of {{components in}} mixture and single breakage to yield the same product t. Based on the energy balance, energy split factors of components in different time and mixed conditions are first determined. This parameter shows no change with time. Calcite increases the grinding efficiency of SCAC significantly, with the energy split factor for SCAC ranging from 0. 68 to 0. 73, which means less specific energy is consumed by SCAC to yield the same t if compared with the single breakage. As the volumetric ratio of calcite increases in mixture, grinding energy efficiency decreases and energy split factor of calcite increases from 1. 70 to 1. 83. Soft material reduces the grinding energy efficiency of hard one in the multi-component breakage...|$|R
40|$|The cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) {{that promote}} cell-cycle {{progression}} are targets for negative regulation by signals from damaged or unreplicated DNA, but also play active roles {{in response to}} DNA lesions. The requirement for activity {{in the face of}} DNA damage implies that there are mechanisms to insulate certain CDKs from checkpoint inhibition. It remains difficult, however, to assign precise functions to specific CDKs in protecting genomic integrity. In mammals, Cdk 2 is active throughout S and G 2 phases, but Cdk 2 protein is dispensable for survival, owing to compensation by other CDKs. That plasticity obscured a requirement for Cdk 2 activity in proliferation of human cells, which we uncovered by replacement of wild-type Cdk 2 with a mutant version sensitized to inhibition by bulky adenine analogs. Here we show that transient, selective inhibition of analog-sensitive (AS) Cdk 2 after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) enhances cell-killing. In extracts supplemented with an ATP analog used preferentially by AS kinases, Cdk 2 (as) phosphorylated the Nijmegen <b>Breakage</b> Syndrome gene <b>product</b> Nbs 1 -a component of the conserved Mre 11 -Rad 50 -Nbs 1 complex required for normal DNA damage repair and checkpoint signaling-dependent on a consensus CDK recognition site at Ser 432. In vivo, selective inhibition of Cdk 2 delayed and diminished Nbs 1 -Ser 432 phosphorylation during S phase, and mutation of Ser 432 to Ala or Asp increased IR-sensitivity. Therefore, by chemical genetics, we uncovered both a non-redundant requirement for Cdk 2 activity in response to DNA damage and a specific target of Cdk 2 within the DNA repair machinery...|$|R

The conference website is at: [URL] continuous replacement of durable consumer goods and disposal of functioning or repairable products into UK landfills or, increasingly, to developing countries, has resulted in global environmental and social consequences. Small appliances, which are easily disposed of in household waste, typically end up in UK landfills, are shipped to developing countries or otherwise ‘lost’. Very few are recycled or repaired, yet many are still functioning when disposed of. Consumers’ willingness, opportunity and ability to carry out repairs have historically been hampered by a range of complex factors. Design for Sustainable Behaviour (DfSB) aims to reduce the environmental and social impacts of products by moderating users’ interaction with them. This paper explores how DfSB strategies can be used to encourage a behavioural shift towards repair of small electrical household appliances by overcoming identified barriers. The paper pulls together literature on repair practice, highlighting gaps in current knowledge and outlines the findings of an extensive UK household survey focused on both <b>product</b> <b>breakage</b> rates and consumer mending behaviour. Three mending typologies and associated personas resulting from the analysis are combined with three DfSB strategies to develop conceptual design interventions to encourage repair. The paper concludes with a discussion of the potential efficacy of the design outcomes from a consumer perspective and the potential ramifications for design practice, whilst considering the wider influences on repair practices beyond design and how these may be addressed...|$|R
40|$|Rice production, {{processing}} and consumption {{are part of}} culture of the Bangladesh population. However, their experiences are very much limited to parboiled paddy for home consumption. Recently, the country attained almost self-sufficiency in paddy production and heading towards production and export of long grain aromatic rice. The milling yield of locally available aromatic rice processed in automatic mills ranged from 50 to 54 %, which may be improved by adopting proper processing technology. Two recently developed aromatic rice i. e. BRRI dhan 37 and BRRI dhan 38 are comparatively longer than the existing aromatic varieties which need better processing technology {{in order to minimize}} <b>breakage</b> and improve <b>product</b> quality. An industry level experiment was conducted at a rubber roll type automatic rice mill located at North-west region of Bangladesh for processing BRRI dhan 37 and BRRI dhan 38. The initial moisture content of BRRI dhan 37 and BRRI dhan 38 were 13. 39 and 12. 86 percents respectively. The paddy was sun dried for 4 hours followed by 20 hours tempering everyday; and were dried for 3, 4, 5, and 6 days. The ranges of temperature and relative humidity during drying of paddy were 34 - 42 o C and 42 - 79 %, respectively. After two days of drying, the moisture content of the paddy reduced to 9 %. However, in the following morning the paddy moisture increased up to 10 % due to condensation. But the hardness of the kernel was on increasing trend, which is necessary to reduce breakage during milling. The highest crushing strengths of BRRI dhan 37 and BRRI dhan 38 were found 8. 0 and 6. 76 kg, respectively at 3 days of drying and tempering which are attributed as the proper milling condition for better head rice recovery. Kernel translucency increased with drying duration irrespective of the variety. The highest milling yield of BRRI dhan 37 was 60. 2 % when samples were dried for 4 days and the highest milling yield of BRRI dhan 38 was 60. 1 % when samples were dried for 3 days. The highest head rice recovery based on milled rice, of BRRI dhan 37 was 90. 4 % when samples were dried for 4 days whereas that of BRRI dhan 38 was 84. 1 % when samples were dried for 3 days...|$|R
