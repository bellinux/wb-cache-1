5000|$|Guarianthe, {{abbreviated}} Gur. in the horticultural trade, {{is a small}} genus of epiphytic orchids, {{growing in}} wet forests in Mexico, Central America, Colombia, Venezuela and Trinidad. It was separated from the <b>bifoliate</b> Cattleyas in 2003, based on phylogenetic studies of nuclear DNA sequence data ...|$|E
50|$|The {{leaves are}} petiolate. Leaf {{arrangement}} usually is opposite, or rarely alternate or verticillate (in whorls). Leaves are usually compound, <b>bifoliate,</b> trifoliate, pinnate, or palmate, or rarely simple. Stipules are absent, but persistent; enlarged axillary bud scales (pseudostipules) are often present. Domatia occur in some genera.|$|E
5000|$|Ctt. Jewel Box is {{a classic}} compact growing red cattleya hybrid. <b>Bifoliate</b> pseudobulbs that are about 4" [...] tall grow along a {{horizontal}} rhizome. A terminal inflorescence is produced from a sheath {{at the tip of}} newly matured pseudobulbs. Ctt. Jewel Box averages 4.8 flowers per inflorescence and 9.2 cm (3.6 inches) natural spread. [...] Flowers are slightly cupped, and vary from magenta to deep red, depending on growth conditions (light/temp) during bud development.|$|E
50|$|Colophospermum mopane, {{commonly}} called mopane, mophane, mopani, balsam tree, butterfly tree, or turpentine tree, is {{a tree in}} the legume family (Fabaceae), that grows in hot, dry, low-lying areas, 200 to 1150 m in elevation, in the far northern parts of southern Africa. The tree only occurs in Africa {{and is the only}} species in genus Colophospermum. Its distinctive butterfly-shaped (<b>bifoliate)</b> leaf and thin seed pod make it easy to identify. In terms of human use it is, together with camel thorn and leadwood, one of the three regionally important firewood trees.|$|E
50|$|The single species, Adamantinia miltonioides, is {{native to}} the Serra do Sincorá range (Brazil, Bahia, South America). It grows as an {{epiphyte}} at sunny positions, at about 900m altitude. Plants bear more or less clustered unifoliate pseudobulbs (rarely <b>bifoliate),</b> coriaceous dark-olive leaves, and possess long inflorescences with successive flowering. Flowers are showy, pink, with similar petals and sepals and a showy dark pink lip, with very small side lobes. Column is short, with a broad stigma. DNA data from trnL-F plastid sequences indicate relationships to Leptotes and Isabelia.|$|E
50|$|Dolichandra unguis-cati has semipersistent foliage. Stems are woody and {{can reach}} 20 meters. Thin and small aerial roots {{are used for}} climbing. Leaves are dark green, {{opposite}} and <b>bifoliate.</b> Leaflets have a length of 3 to 4 cm. The plant produces flowers during the wet season. Flowers are yellow, have a diameter of 4 to 5 cm and can grow alone or in groups of 2 or 3. Long primary roots extend beneath the soil surface, producing large tubers 40-50 centimetres long.

5000|$|The monocots {{are one of}} {{the major}} {{divisions}} of the flowering plants or angiosperms. They have been recognized as a natural group since John Ray's studies of seed structure in the 17th century. Ray was the first botanical systematist, and in his examination of seeds, first observed the dichotomy of cotyledon structure. He reported his findings in a paper read to the Royal Society on 17 December 1674, entitled [...] "A Discourse on the Seeds of Plants". Since this paper appeared a year before the publication of Malpighi's Anatome Plantarum (1675-1679), Ray has the priority. At the time, Ray did not fully realise the importance of his discovery but progressively developed this over successive publications. And since these were in Latin, [...] "seed leaves" [...] became folia seminalia and then cotyledon, following Malpighi. Malpighi and Ray were familiar with each other's work, and Malpighi in describing the same structures had introduced the term cotyledon, which Ray adopted in his subsequent writing. In this experiment, Malpighi also showed that the cotyledons were critical {{to the development of the}} plant, proof that Ray required for his theory. In his Methodus plantarum nova Ray also developed and justified the [...] "natural" [...] or pre-evolutionary approach to classification, based on characteristics selected a posteriori in order to group together taxa that have the greatest number of shared characteristics. This approach, also referred to as polythetic would last till evolutionary theory enabled Eichler to develop the phyletic system that superseded it in the late nineteenth century, based on an understanding of the acquisition of characteristics. He also made the crucial observation Ex hac seminum divisione sumum potest generalis plantarum distinctio, eaque meo judicio omnium prima et longe optima, in eas sci. quae plantula seminali sunt bifolia aut διλόβω, et quae plantula sem. adulta analoga. (From this division of the seeds derives a general distinction amongst plants, that in my judgement is first and by far the best, into those seed plants which are <b>bifoliate,</b> or bilobed, and those that are analogous to the adult), that is between monocots and dicots. He illustrated this with by quoting from Malpighi and including reproductions of Malpighi's drawings of cotyledons (see figure). Initially Ray did not develop a classification of flowering plants (florifera) based on a division by the number of cotyledons, but developed his ideas over successive publications, coining the terms Monocotyledones and Dicotyledones in 1703, in the revised version of his Methodus (Methodus plantarum emendata), as a primary method for dividing them, Herbae floriferae, dividi possunt, ut diximus, in Monocotyledones & Dicotyledones (Flowering plants, can be divided, as we have said, into Monocotyledons & Dicotyledons).|$|E
40|$|Brasiliorchis R. Singer, S. Koehler & Carnevali is here {{proposed}} {{to include the}} orchid species formerly recognized in the Maxillaria picto alliance, all orchid group mostly endemic to the Atlantic Rain 1, Forest Biome, in south and southeastern Brazil. The new genus is supported by both morphological features and ongoing molecular studies. The new genus is easily diagnosed by its sulcate to ridged, <b>bifoliate</b> pseudobulbs and its long-lasting, campanulate, rewardless flowers. The pollinaria of these flowers are normally devoid of slipes. Formal diagnosis of the genus and 13 taxonomic conibinations are presented: Brasiliorchis barbozae (Loefgren) R. Singer, S. Koehler & Carnevali, B. chrysantha (Barbosa Rodrigues) R. Singer, S. Koehler & Carnevali, B. consanguinea (Klotzsch) R. Siriger, S. Koehler & Carnevali, B. gracilis (Loddiges) R. Singer, S.

Koehler & Carnevali, B. phoenicanthera (Barbosa Rodrigues) R. Singer, S. Koehler & Carnevali, B. picta (Hooker) R. Singer, S. Koehler & Carnevali, B. polyantha (Barbosa Rodrigues) R. Singer, S. Koehler & Carnevali, B. porphyrostele (Reichenbach f.) R. Singer, S. Koehler & Carnevali, B. schunkeana (Campacci & Kautsky) R. Singer, S. Koehler & Carnevali, and B. ubatubana (Hoelne) R. Singer, S. Koehler & Carnevali. Leclotypes are designated for B. barbozae, B. chrysantha, B. heismanniana, B. phoenicanthera, B. picta, and B. polyantha. A neotype is proposed for A consanguinea. In addition, a key to distinguish Brasiliorchis from other sympatric <b>bifoliate</b> orchids within Brazilian Maxillariinae is presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{invasive}} liana cat’s claw creeper Dolichandra unguis-cati (L.) L. G. Lohmann (syn. Macfadyena unguis-cati (L.) A. H. Gentry) exhibits intraspecific {{variation in}} leaf morphology, {{but this is}} rarely noted in the published literature. The present study documents variation in leaf morphology in two forms of the species that occur in Australia (long pod and short pod). Leaf morphology is compared between the two forms and {{the position of the}} shoots (trunk and ground) at the only two sites in which they co-occur. Leaves were categorised on the basis of leaflet number and {{the presence or absence of}} tendrils. Simple leaves were produced mainly on shoots growing along the ground and were more abundant in the short-pod form. Long-pod plants were dominated by <b>bifoliate</b> leaves with tendrils. Cat’s claw creeper exhibits considerably wider variation in leaf morphology than recorded previously. Variations in leaf morphology may be linked to differences in the genotype, developmental stage and plastic responses of the plants. Understanding these variations may have implications for taxonomic delimitation and improved management, particularly biological control involving leaf-feeding insects...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{examined}} leaf CO 2 {{assimilation and}} how it varied among species within the orchid genus Cattleya. Measurements of CO 2 assimilation and maximum quantum yield of PS II (Fv/Fm) were made for mature leaves of nine species using a portable system for photosyn-thesis measurement and a portable fluorometer. Leaf area was measured with an area meter, and the specific leaf mass was determined. DNA of nine Cattleya species and two species of Hadrolaelia was extracted us-ing the CTAB protocol. Each sample was amplified and sequenced using primers for the trnL gene. The phylogenetic analyses, using neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony methods, retrieved a group that in-cluded Cattleya and Hadrolaelia species, in which the unifoliate species were separated from the bifoliates. The topologies of the two cladograms showed some similarities. However, C. guttata (<b>bifoliate)</b> {{was placed in the}} unifoliate clade in the neighbor-joining tree, while C. warneri (uni-foliate) was not placed in this clade in the maximum parsimony tree. Most Cattleya species keep the leaf stomata closed from 6 am to 4 pm. We suggest that C. elongata, C. tigrina and C. tenuis have C 3 -crassu-lacean acid metabolism since they open their stomata around 12 am. The Fv/Fm values remained relatively constant during the measurements of CO 2 assimilation. The same was observed for the specific leaf mass val-ues, although great variations were found in the leaf area values. When the species were grouped using molecular data in the neighbor-joining 977 ©FUNPEC-RP www. funpecrp. com. brGenetics and Molecular Research 8 (3) : 976 - 989 (2009) Leaf carbon assimilation and molecular phylogeny in Cattleya analysis, no relation was observed with CO 2 assimilation.
