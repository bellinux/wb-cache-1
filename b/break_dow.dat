40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} vortex breakdown on delta wings at high angles of attack is presented. As suggested by previous works, perturbations {{are used to}} change the platform of the delta wings to reduce the detrimental effects of vortex breakdown {{brought about by the}} Self-Induction Theory. Different patterns of ‘round ’ perturbations are tested to obtain the favourable lift and drag characteristics for each wing. With the best pattern identified later, optimization of the shape of perturbation is explored to further improve the results. ‘Teardrop’ and ‘diamond ’ perturbations are introduced as basis of comparison. Force measurements were conducted over a range of α = 0 to 40 ° to justify the concept of surface shaping and evaluate its effectiveness. Dye flow visualization were used to obtain sectional views of the leading-edge vortices as they <b>break</b> <b>dow...</b>|$|E

40|$|Using DPIV {{measurement}} method, 2 -D instantaneous velocity distributions in both {{near and}} far fields of a axisymmetric free air jet at moderate Reynolds numbers are measured in detail. The vorticity distributions and stream line maps also are calculated from these measured velocity distributions. By ensenblely averaging instantaneous velocity distributions, some statistical parameters of jet, i. e., mean velocity, mean turbulent intensity, are calculated. The statistical characteristics of jet are analyzed in detail. These measurement results of statistical characteristics confirm with that obtained by previous researchers by pointless methods. According to the measurement results of instantaneous velocity and vorticity distributions {{as well as that}} of flow visualization, the evolution process of vortex in shear layer are also analyzed, such as, originating, growing, pairing, deforming, and <b>breaking</b> <b>dow...</b>|$|R

Mirtazapine (Remeron �) and Pregnancy This sheet talks about the risks that {{exposure}} to mirtazapine can have during pregnancy. With each pregnancy, all women have a 3 % to 5 % chance of having a baby with a birth defect. This information should not {{take the place of}} medical care and advice from your health care provider. What is mirtazapine? Mirtazapine is a medication used in the treatment of major depressive disorders. The brand name for mirtazapine is Remeron ®. Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic antidepressant.

5|$|After his defeat, Dow {{continued}} to promote prohibition around the country, and was gratified {{to see it}} spread to eleven states. He also made efforts to refute the charge made by his enemies (including his cousin John Neal) that the Maine law was ineffective and that drinking had actually increased in Portland during Dow's term in office. In 1854, Dow ran for mayor again unsuccessfully; as the Whig Party began to <b>break</b> apart, <b>Dow</b> attracted support from the Free Soilers and the Know Nothings, a nativist party. By the next year, those two parties began to join anti-slavery Whigs in a new party, the Republicans. They soon controlled the state legislature and, with Dow's encouragement, strengthened the enforcement provisions of the Maine law. Dow ran again for mayor in 1855 and was narrowly re-elected to the office he had left three years earlier.|$|R
