40|$|In this three-wave {{longitudinal}} survey, {{we investigated}} bi-directional longitudinal associations between <b>best</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> adolescents' alcohol consumption. Additionally, since {{the relation between}} <b>best</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> adolescents' drinking may be stronger if adolescents have not consumed alcohol yet, we examined this relation not only with regard to continuation but also {{with regard to the}} initiation of adolescent drinking. We also hypothesized that low levels of self-esteem and self-control in youths would be related to a higher susceptibility to the impact of their best friends' drinking. Data were used from 433 adolescents <b>and</b> their <b>best</b> <b>friends.</b> Results of SEM analyses did not provide evidence for bi-directional associations between <b>best</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> adolescents' alcohol use over time. Nevertheless, the results of additional growth curve analyses indicated that adolescents and best friends' drinking does seem to develop in a similar fashion over time. Adolescents' self-esteem, self-control, and gender did not moderate longitudinal associations between <b>best</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> adolescents' drinking. The discussion focuses on methodological and theoretical explanations for the absence of significant longitudinal relations between <b>best</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> adolescents' drinking...|$|R
