5|$|As of April 6, 2011, Twitter {{engineers}} confirmed {{they had}} switched {{away from their}} Ruby on Rails search stack, to a Java server they call <b>Blender.</b>|$|E
5|$|With {{a greater}} degree of {{certainty}} established, the Kepler team compared the models formed using <b>Blender</b> to the photometric observations collected by the Kepler satellite. The <b>Blender</b> technique allowed the Kepler team to rule out the majority of the alternatives including, notably, that of triple star systems. <b>Blender</b> then allowed the Kepler team to determine that although all models representing hierarchical triple stars (a binary system between a single star and a double star) can resemble the light curve of Kepler-10, the aforementioned follow-up observations would have detected them all. The only possible blends remaining after ruling out hierarchical triple stars was that of determining if the curve is caused by interference from a background star, or if it is indeed caused by the orbit of a transiting planet.|$|E
5|$|Myriad {{additional}} ingredients can be used, including onion, {{roasted red}} bell pepper, {{red and green}} chili peppers, cilantro, lime, lime juice and lime zest, lemon juice, sour cream, oil, lard, vinegar and apple cider vinegar, water, and spices such as garlic, cumin, coriander, chili powder and cayenne, hot sauce, salt and pepper. The various ingredients can be mixed or puréed together using a food processor, a <b>blender,</b> or by hand. Bean dip is sometimes topped with shredded cheese and garnished with ingredients such as chopped cilantro, chopped green onion, chopped fresh or dried parsley and lime zest, among others.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blenders</b> are blade {{grinders}} {{designed specifically}} for use with wet ingredients. <b>Blenders</b> are popular tools for production of purées and pastes, using both the cutting and shearing effects of high speed blades.|$|R
50|$|The {{container}} rests upon a {{base that}} contains a motor for turning the blade assembly and has controls on its surface. Most modern <b>blenders</b> offer {{a number of possible}} speeds. Low-powered <b>blenders</b> require the addition of some liquid to operate correctly. In these <b>blenders,</b> the liquid helps move the solids around the jar, bringing them in contact with the blades. The blades create a whirlpool effect which moves solids from top to bottom, ensuring even contact with the blade. This creates a homogeneous mixture. High-powered <b>blenders</b> are capable of milling grains and crushing ice without such assistance.|$|R

5|$|In January 2011, the closely {{orbiting}} planet Kepler-10b {{was confirmed}} in {{the orbit of}} the star Kepler-10 after measurements of its transiting behavior (where it crosses in front of Kepler-10, periodically dimming it) and a radial velocity effect detected in Kepler-10's spectrum provided the information needed {{to prove that it}} was indeed a planet. An additional, longer-period dimming was detected in Kepler-10's spectrum, suggesting that a second planet existed in the system; however, there remained the possibility that this signal could have some other cause, and that the transit event was a false positive. Attempts to measure the radial velocity effects of this object, now named KOI 072.02, were fruitless; therefore, to rule out false positive scenarios, the Kepler team used a technique called <b>Blender.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kepler-10c is an {{exoplanet}} {{orbiting the}} G-type star Kepler-10, located around 568 light-years away in Draco. Its discovery was announced by Kepler in May 2011, {{although it had}} {{been seen as a}} planetary candidate since January 2011, when Kepler-10b was discovered. The team confirmed the observation using data from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope and a technique called <b>Blender</b> that ruled out most false positives. Kepler-10c was the third transiting planet to be confirmed statistically (based on probability rather than actual observation), after Kepler-9d and Kepler-11g. The Kepler team considers the statistical method that led to the discovery of Kepler-10c as what will be necessary to confirm many planets in Kepler's field of view.|$|E
5|$|Python {{has been}} {{successfully}} embedded in many software products as a scripting language, including in finite element method software such as Abaqus, 3D parametric modeler like FreeCAD, 3D animation packages such as 3ds Max, <b>Blender,</b> Cinema 4D, Lightwave, Houdini, Maya, modo, MotionBuilder, Softimage, the visual effects compositor Nuke, 2D imaging programs like GIMP, Inkscape, Scribus and Paint Shop Pro, and musical notation programs like scorewriter and capella. GNU Debugger uses Python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C++ containers. Esri promotes Python as {{the best choice for}} writing scripts in ArcGIS. It has also been used in several video games, and has been adopted as first of the three available programming languages in Google App Engine, the other two being Java and Go. Python is also used in algorithmic trading and quantitative finance. Python can also be implemented in APIs of online brokerages that run on other languages by using wrappers.|$|E
50|$|Osterizer <b>blenders</b> tended towards heavy {{construction}} and motors. While this raised cost, many early-model Osterizers still function today, {{and are more}} powerful than a majority of contemporary consumer <b>blenders.</b> Oster Platinum Face 60-Minute Timer celebrated the 80th Anniversary on December 2010.|$|R

40|$|Volumetric {{excise tax}} credits—more {{commonly}} known as <b>blenders</b> tax credits—have been in place since 1978 for ethanol and since 2004 for biodiesel. The ethanol subsidy will fall from its current level of 51 ¢ per gallon today to 45 ¢ per gallon on January 1. The biodiesel subsidy is $ 1. 00 per gallon (50 ¢ per gallon for previously used oils or grease). The subsidy is paid on every gallon of ethanol or biodiesel that is blended in the United States with any quantity of fossil fuel. All biofuels blended with fossil fuels are eligible for the subsidy regardless of where the biofuels were produced or where the blend is consumed. The <b>blenders</b> tax credit reduces the tax liability of <b>blenders,</b> so it {{is equivalent to the}} U. S. Treasury writing a check to <b>blenders</b> for each gallon of biofuels they use. The purpose of the subsidy is to increase the willingness of <b>blenders</b> to buy U. S. -produced biofuels and to increase the domestic price of biofuels. It has undoubtedly met these objectives for U. S. -produced corn ethanol. But opponents of the biodiesel <b>blenders</b> credit argue that its main effect is to subsidize biodiesel produced in Southeast Asia, South America, and Europe that is destined for European consumption...|$|R
5|$|The {{application}} of <b>Blender</b> was supplemented {{by use of}} the IRAC instrument on the Spitzer Space Telescope, which was used on August 30 and November 15, 2010, to further define Kepler-10's light curve {{at the point where}} KOI 072.02 appeared to transit it. It was found that the transiting object did not produce a color, an aspect that is characteristic of stars. This suggested even further that KOI 072.02 was a planet. In addition, the IRAC instrument found no difference in the transit signal when comparing the star's light curve in the infrared and in visible light; stars that are aligned with Kepler-10 might appear visibly similar, but would appear different in the infrared.|$|E
5|$|The city {{consists}} of five areas: Lefty's Bar, a hotel casino, a 24-hour wedding chapel, a discothèque, and a convenience store. The player can walk between {{areas that are}} next to each other, but other areas can only be accessed by hailing a taxi, which costs the player money; {{failure to do so}} results in Larry's being mugged or hit by oncoming traffic. During {{the early stages of the}} game, Larry can survive most premature deaths. In the original release, a compartment opens beneath Larry's body and takes him to a laboratory where heroes from Sierra's computer games—such as King's Quest—are re-assembled; in the remake, Larry's remains are instead thrown inside a <b>blender</b> and reformed.|$|E
5|$|Using {{a program}} called Blendanal, similar to the <b>Blender</b> {{technique}} used to verify the planets discovered by Kepler, the astronomers observing HAT-P-33 hoped to rule out false positive alternatives that could explain the planet-like signal seen in HAT-P-33's light curve and radial velocity. The use of Blendanal ruled out the possibilities that the signal was caused by that of a hierarchical triple star or a mixture between a bright star and a binary star in the background. The possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star whose secondary companion is too dim to be distinguishable from the brighter star could not be ruled out. However, the data indicated that the planet HAT-P-33b did indeed exist.|$|E

5|$|As a {{birthday}} gift for Marge, Homer buys a <b>blender</b> designed by television chef Paula Paul. He {{goes to a}} health food store called Swapper Jack's, where Paula is giving away autographs, to have Paula sign it. Homer is impressed by the store and {{says he will not}} be shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart any more. Apu, who is there to spy, overhears Homer and the two engage in a fight until the security guards grab hold of Apu and take him away. At the signing, Homer tells Paula that Marge is a big fan of hers. Paula decides that she will call Marge live during her upcoming show to wish her a happy birthday. Meanwhile, Bart gets his mother a rabbit for her birthday. The rabbit chews through the phone lines in the Simpsons' home, causing Marge to miss Paula's call. Paula becomes furious at Marge for not answering the phone as she embarrassed herself on her show. Homer punishes Bart by locking him up in the rabbit's cage.|$|E
