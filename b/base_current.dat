25|$|The {{magnitude}} and sign of both those parameters {{are controlled by}} the <b>base</b> <b>current</b> : since both base-collector and base-emitter junctions are inversely biased in the quiescent state, the equivalent circuit of the base input is simply a current generator shunted by base-emitter and base-collector junction capacitances and is therefore not analyzed in what follows.|$|E

25|$|Heterojunction {{transistors}} {{have different}} semiconductors for {{the elements of}} the transistor. Usually the emitter is composed of a larger bandgap material than the base. The figure shows that this difference in bandgap allows the barrier for holes to inject backward from the base into the emitter, denoted in the figure as Δφp, to be made large, while the barrier for electrons to inject into the base Δφn is made low. This barrier arrangement helps reduce minority carrier injection from the base when the emitter-base junction is under forward bias, and thus reduces <b>base</b> <b>current</b> and increases emitter injection efficiency.|$|E
25|$|One {{advantage}} of the FET is its high gate to main current resistance, {{on the order of}} 100 MΩ or more, thus providing a high degree of isolation between control and flow. Because <b>base</b> <b>current</b> noise will increase with shaping time, a FET typically produces less noise than a bipolar junction transistor (BJT), and is thus found in noise sensitive electronics such as tuners and low-noise amplifiers for VHF and satellite receivers. It is relatively immune to radiation. It exhibits no offset voltage at zero drain current and hence makes an excellent signal chopper. It typically has better thermal stability than a BJT. Because they are controlled by gate charge, once the gate is closed or opened, there is no additional power draw, as there would be with a bipolar junction transistor or with non-latching relays in some states. This allows extremely low-power switching, which in turn allows greater miniaturization of circuits because heat dissipation needs are reduced compared to other types of switches.|$|E
2500|$|Forward-active (or simply active): The base–emitter {{junction}} is {{forward biased}} and the base–collector junction is reverse biased.

50|$|It is {{possible}} to connect a floating source between the two bases, but {{it is necessary to}} ensure paths for the biasing <b>base</b> <b>currents.</b> In the case of galvanic source, only one resistor has to be connected between one of the bases and the ground. The biasing current will enter directly this base and indirectly (through the input source) the other one. If the source is capacitive, two resistors have to be connected between the two bases and the ground to ensure different paths for the <b>base</b> <b>currents.</b>|$|R

2500|$|In {{analog circuit}} design, the current-control view is {{sometimes}} used {{because it is}} approximately linear. That is, the collector current is approximately [...] times the <b>base</b> <b>current.</b> Some basic circuits can be designed by assuming that the emitter–base voltage is approximately constant, and that collector current is beta times the <b>base</b> <b>current.</b> However, to accurately and reliably design production BJT circuits, the voltage-control (for example, Ebers–Moll) model is required. The voltage-control model requires an exponential function {{to be taken into}} account, but when it is linearized such that the transistor can be modeled as a transconductance, as in the Ebers–Moll model, design for circuits such as differential amplifiers again becomes a mostly linear problem, so the voltage-control view is often preferred. For translinear circuits, in which the exponential I–V curve is key to the operation, the transistors are usually modeled as voltage-controlled current sources whose transconductance is proportional to their collector current. In general, transistor-level circuit design is performed using SPICE or a comparable analog circuit simulator, so model complexity is usually not of much concern to the designer.|$|E
2500|$|The diagram shows a {{schematic}} representation of an NPN transistor connected to two voltage sources. ( [...] The same description applies to a PNP transistor with reversed directions of current flow and applied voltage.) [...] To make the transistor conduct appreciable current (on {{the order of}} 1mA) from C to E, VBE must be above a minimum value {{sometimes referred to as}} the cut-in voltage. The cut-in voltage is usually about 650mV for silicon BJTs at room temperature but can be different {{depending on the type of}} transistor and its biasing. This applied voltage causes the lower P-N junction to 'turn on', allowing a flow of electrons from the emitter into the base. In active mode, the electric field existing between base and collector (caused by VCE) will cause the majority of these electrons to cross the upper P-N junction into the collector to form the collector current IC. The remainder of the electrons recombine with holes, the majority carriers in the base, making a current through the base connection to form the <b>base</b> <b>current,</b> IB. As shown in the diagram, the emitter current, IE, is the total transistor current, which is the sum of the other terminal currents, (i.e., IE=IB+IC).|$|E
