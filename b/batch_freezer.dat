5000|$|Ciao Bella {{began as}} an idea {{in the summer of}} 1983 when cousins Jon F. Snyder and Laura Grady were on a summer holiday in Italy. They both were fascinated with the {{uniqueness}} of Italian ice creams, having grown up working in their grandparents' Carvel ice cream store in Peekskill, NY. Jon, only 19 at the time, in particular, became obsessed with the idea of bringing a version of gelato to New York City. He eventually quit school, raised $25,000 from family and friends and, with Laura and her sister Christine's help, opened a small shop at 451 broome street in the SoHo area of manhattan, in May 1984. Their focus was on building up a wholesale business as they canvassed NY restaurants with samples, trying to build a sustainable year-round enterprise. In five years, they built a substantial clientele of chefs which included Charlie Palmer of the River Cafe, the [...] "21" [...] Club, the Russian Tea Room, NY's Famous Balducci's market, and dozens of other eclectic NY eateries. Having grown the business to a sustainable level, Jon felt it time to move on and put an ad to sell the company in the NY Times in 1989. Pearce saw the ad. Believing it to be a brilliant idea to buy it, he borrowed $90,000 from his mother- enough to buy the store, a <b>batch</b> <b>freezer,</b> a pick up truck, and the recipes for 60 flavors. In the beginning, everything, from mixing flavors to delivering the product, was done by Pearce and a few part-time employees. By 1993, he managed to bring sales up to $1 million. In the same year, he was introduced to a banker, Charlie Apt, who was the partner he was looking for to expand to a larger market. Thanks to his knack for sales, which included cold-calling countless restaurants and adding colors and logos to the then-white pints, product sales doubled to $2 million within another year. In addition, Jon Snyder, later in 2001, after years out of the ice cream business, opened 'il laboratorio del gelato' on NYC's lower east side, rededicated to servicing NYC restaurants in particular.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{freezing}} {{process is}} very important in ice cream production affecting quality, taste and yield of the finished product. <b>Batch</b> <b>freezer</b> machines use different control techniques to tightly control the freezing process, based on monitoring of the temperature and/or the viscosity (i. e. consistency) of the product. Temperature control, however, features low sensitivity and need calibration for different product compositions, while product viscosity is essentially inferred from dasher motor load, sensitive to power line fluctuations, volume of product and dasher motor characteristics. In this context, this paper presents a novel technique based on measurements of the product electrical characteristics, tightly linked to temperature and viscosity. The experimental results presented in this work clearly indicate that the proposed technique provides a suitable, nondestructive tool to monitor ice cream quality product that overcomes the drawbacks of the standard methods, thus representing an advance {{in the state of the}} art for freezing control...|$|E

50|$|When Steve Herrell founded Steve's Ice Cream in 1973, he {{mechanically}} altered a small <b>batch</b> commercial <b>freezer</b> {{to produce}} an extraordinarily rich, creamy, low-air ice cream. Herrell {{was introduced to the}} Heath Bar candy bar by a friend in the late 1960s and felt it would make an excellent addition to ice cream. When he opened his first store, instead of having pre-mixed flavors like chocolate chip, he had his staff mix freshly made ice cream with candy or other confections based upon customer requests. These candy additions were called mix-ins, and the custom-blended flavors proved to be highly desired by the customer. Steve sold out of ice cream on his first day, and the store became very popular in a short time.|$|R

5000|$|The {{continuous}} freeze {{method of}} producing ice cream is nearly obsolete {{along the east}} coast. “Though popular {{in some parts of}} the Midwest, particularly Milwaukee, the custard-style confection -- also known as continuous freeze ice cream -- is a rarity in Virginia and most of the United States.“ This continuous freeze method means that the ice cream is frozen and mixed at the same time with little air added during this process. The more popular soft-serve method of production churns the ice cream then adds a substantial amount of air while it is being frozen. The soft serve method allows for larger batches to be made at one time and produces a lighter, air filled ice cream. Bigger ice cream chains such as Dairy Queen use this soft serve method. The original owners of Dairy Queen teamed up to create a new freezer that was larger and could hold much more of the product. “The basic principle behind this new freezer concept was to scrape frozen mix from the inside of a drum resembling the barrel of a <b>batch</b> brine <b>freezer,</b> and pump air into the mix as it was frozen.” Because Kline's does not use this method, they make smaller batches and cannot work as efficiently as the chain businesses. Kline’s product is denser since there is less air added into the mixture. “It also means more milk, fruit and flavoring in every cup or cone.” [...] Each batch of continuous freeze is “a process that only takes about two minutes from start to finish”. But since it does not make as much as the conventional soft serve method, it takes much longer to make the same amount through this method. With continuous freeze, very little air is added as the machines slowly push out the final product, making only about 10 gallons an hour. Despite the time and effort it takes to use this method, Kline's makes their ice cream fresh everyday. In order to make up for the time of production, they only make three flavors every week and have a rather rushed atmosphere. Kline’s makes their ice cream fresh every morning to sell throughout the day.|$|R
40|$|Dietary fiber is {{currently}} {{added to a}} wide range of commercial food products including dairy, baked goods, and some frozen desserts. Different types of dietary fiber have different properties and functions when used in food. The most basic categories of dietary fiber are soluble and insoluble. Our objective was to determine if an acceptable frozen yogurt product supplemented with dietary fiber could be produced. Three different types of dietary fiber were used: Frutafit TEX! (inulin), Glucagel� (betaglucan), and Vitacel SMOOV 240 (cellulose). These three were used at the 3 %, 5 % and 7 % levels in the frozen yogurt. Frozen yogurt base was manufactured using nonfat milk, heavy cream, sugar, corn syrup solids, nonfat dry milk, stabilizer, water, and vanilla. The base was mixed with yogurt (ratio of 80 : 20) that had been cultured from nonfat milk, and a yogurt culture containing Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Fiber was weighed and blended with the base before the yogurt was added. Vanilla flavoring was added, and the treatments were frozen using a <b>batch</b> ice cream <b>freezer.</b> Microbiological enumeration was conducted on the treatments before being frozen. Titratable acidity and pH were also measured on the treatments before and after being frozen. A descriptive sensory analysis, hedonic sensory study, viscosity, texture analysis, and melt rate test were conducted during storage. Lactic acid bacteria counts were found to be around 7. 9 x 107 CFU/ml. Titratable acidity and pH did not change when measured before and after freezing, and did not show a difference between types, or levels of fiber. The types and levels of fiber used had a significant effect on the flavor and texture of the frozen yogurt products, as well the overall liking. The results suggest that a frozen yogurt product could be successfully manufactured when fortified with 7 % Frutafit TEX!...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science Institute, Human NutritionDelores H. ChambersFresh mangoes {{are highly}} perishable, and therefore, {{they are often}} {{processed}} to extend shelf-life and facilitate exportation. Studying the transformation that mango cultivars undergo throughout processing can aid in selecting appropriate varieties for products. In the 1 st part of this study, the flavor and texture properties of 4 mango cultivars available in the United States (U. S.) were analyzed. Highly trained descriptive panelists in the U. S. evaluated fresh, purée, and sorbet samples prepared from each cultivar. Purées were made by pulverizing mango flesh, passing it through a china cap, and heating it to 85 °C for 15 s. For the sorbets, purées were diluted with water (1 : 1), sucrose was added, and the bases were frozen in a <b>batch</b> ice cream <b>freezer.</b> Much of the texture variation among cultivars was lost after fresh samples were transformed into purées, whereas much of the flavor and texture variation among cultivars was lost once fresh mangoes and mango purées were transformed into sorbets. Compared to the other cultivars, Haden and Tommy Atkins underwent greater transformations in flavor throughout sorbet preparation, and processing reduced the intensities of some unpleasant flavors in these cultivars. Tommy Atkins was the only cultivar that had flavor differences from other cultivars when it was in sorbet. Results suggest that cultivar variation is generally not detectable in mango sorbet unless the cultivar has a distinct initial flavor. In the 2 nd part of this study, descriptive panelists in Thailand evaluated the flavor and texture properties of fresh samples and purées prepared from 6 cultivars grown in Thailand. Thermal processing had unique effects on the flavor of each cultivar, especially Nam Dok Mai and Chok Anun; Nam Dok Mai significantly decreased in mango identity and peach flavors after processing, whereas Chok Anun significantly increased in sweet, mango identity, and pineapple flavors. Although a slight amount of flavor variation among cultivars was lost because of thermal processing, most of the texture variation was eliminated. Because of significant changes in flavor and texture after heat treatment of mango cultivars, manufacturers should select cultivars for mango purées based on their properties after thermal processing...|$|R
