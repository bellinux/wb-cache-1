5|$|Archaeologists {{developed}} the Late Bronze Age chronologies of eastern Mediterranean cultures by analysing {{the origin of}} artifacts (for example, items from Crete, mainland Greece, Cyprus or Canaan) found in each archaeological layer. If an artifact's origin can be accurately dated, it gives a reference date for the layer {{in which it is}} found. If the Thera eruption could <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> given layer of Cretan (or other) culture, chronologists could use the date of that layer to date the eruption itself. Since Thera's culture at the time of destruction was similar to the Late Minoan IA (LMIA) culture on Crete, LMIA is the baseline to establish chronology elsewhere. The eruption also aligns with Late Cycladic I (LCI) and Late Helladic I (LHI) cultures, but predates Peloponnesian LHI. Archeological digs on Akrotiri have also yielded fragments of nine Syro-Palestinian Middle Bronze II (MBII) gypsum vessels.|$|E
5|$|College {{football}} {{maintained a}} tradition of postseason bowl games. Each bowl game would <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> particular conference, and earning a spot in a bowl game was the reward for winning a conference. This arrangement was profitable, but it tended to prevent the two top-ranked teams from meeting in a true national championship game, as they would normally be committed to the bowl games of their respective conferences. Several systems have been used since 1992 to determine a national champion of college football. The first was the Bowl Coalition, in place from 1992 to 1994. This was replaced in 1995 by the Bowl Alliance, which gave way in 1997 to the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). The BCS arrangement proved to be controversial, and was replaced in 2014 by the College Football Playoff (CFP).|$|E

5|$|Hunter {{began to}} achieve limited success after {{a trip to}} the Etaples art colony in {{northern}} France in 1914. Here, inspired by French art and the local landscape, he began to develop the style and ability that would later identify him as a colourist. However, the onset of the First World War forced him to return to Scotland, where his work became noticed by Alexander Reid of Reid & Lefevre. In 1915, Hunter held his first one-man exhibition with Reid in Glasgow. Hunter's work at this stage of his career focused primarily on still lifes, inspired by Chardin, Kalf and Manet. During the 1920s, Hunter began to <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> group of three other artists: John Duncan Fergusson, F. C. B. Cadell, and Samuel Peploe. The four of them became known as the Scottish Colourists, although the term was not used until 1948, by which time only Fergusson was still alive.|$|E

5|$|Medical {{complications}} {{are associated}} with a bad prognosis. Examples are hypotension (low blood pressure), hypoxia (low blood oxygen saturation), lower cerebral perfusion pressures and longer times spent with high intracranial pressures. Patient characteristics also influence prognosis. Factors thought to worsen it include abuse of substances such as illicit drugs and alcohol and age over sixty or under two years (in children, younger age at time of injury may <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> slower recovery of some abilities). Other influences that may affect recovery include pre-injury intellectual ability, coping strategies, personality traits, family environment, social support systems and financial circumstances.|$|E

40|$|Background Dermoscopically, one of {{the most}} common {{findings}} in melanocytic lesions is a globular pattern. A regular globular pattern is a common finding in naevi. Melanoma can also show <b>a</b> globular pattern, <b>with</b> globules typically irregular in size, colour and distribution. Objectives To investigate the likelihood of diagnosing melanoma according to distinct dermoscopic and confocal aspects. Methods Dermoscopic and confocal aspects of 83 excised melanocytic lesions dermoscopically showing globules were analysed. Results Our study population included 39 acquired melanocytic naevi, 16 Spitz naevi and 28 melanomas. Univariate analysis showed that regular distribution of globules on dermoscopy <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> ninefold lower risk for melanoma, whereas <b>an</b> irregular distribution <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> almost 10 -fold increased risk for melanoma. Concerning confocal features, dense nests <b>are</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fivefold lower risk for melanoma, whereas loosely arranged nests <b>are</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> almost sixfold risk for melanoma; moreover, the presence of round cells <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 17 -fold lower risk for melanoma, whereas pleomorphic cells <b>are</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> almost 16 -fold risk for melanoma. Conclusions So that melanoma is not missed, clinicians should carefully analyse globular lesions in adults, focusing, in particular, on the distribution of globules and on the presence of confocal cytological atypia...|$|R
