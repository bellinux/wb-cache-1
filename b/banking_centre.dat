25|$|By {{the first}} half of the 18th century, despite rising {{prosperity}} evidenced by its growing importance as a <b>banking</b> <b>centre,</b> Edinburgh was described as one of Europe's most densely populated, overcrowded and unsanitary towns. Visitors were struck by the fact that the various social classes shared the same urban space, even inhabiting the same tenement buildings; although here a form of social segregation did prevail, whereby shopkeepers and tradesmen tended to occupy the cheaper-to-rent cellars and garrets, while the more well-to-do professional classes occupied the more expensive middle storeys.|$|E
25|$|In 1772, Arthur Heywood's Bank {{opened in}} Manchester, {{but the money}} was {{transferred}} daily via coach and horses to major banks in London, and many were attacked by highwaymen. The first bank to hold its own reserves of notes and coins was the Bank of Manchester which opened on Market Street in 1829. Next was the Manchester & Liverpool District Bank on Spring Gardens in 1832, followed by many others {{in the same area}} around Spring Gardens, Fountain Street and King Street which became the Central Business District and <b>banking</b> <b>centre.</b>|$|E

25|$|Marshall's Mill {{was one of}} {{the first}} of many {{factories}} constructed in Leeds from around 1790 when the most significant were woollen finishing and flax mills. Manufacturing diversified by 1914 to printing, engineering, chemicals and clothing manufacture. Decline in manufacturing during the 1930s was temporarily reversed by a switch to producing military uniforms and munitions during World War II. However, by the 1970s, the clothing industry was in irreversible decline, facing cheap foreign competition. The contemporary economy has been shaped by Leeds City Council's vision of building a '24-hour European city' and 'capital of the north'. The city has developed from the decay of the post-industrial era to become a telephone <b>banking</b> <b>centre,</b> connected to the electronic infrastructure of the modern global economy. There has been growth in the corporate and legal sectors, and increased local affluence has led to an expanding retail sector, including the luxury goods market. In a 2010 index of sustainable cities, Leeds placed 6th for the second year running.|$|E
500|$|Place des Nations, {{where the}} opening and closing ceremonies were held remains, however in an {{abandoned}} and deteriorating state.

Other remaining structures include sculptures, lampposts and landscaping. [...] The Montreal Metro subway station Berri Uqam still has an original [...] "Man and His World" [...] welcome sign with logo above the pedestrian tunnel entrance to the Yellow Line. La Ronde survives, and since 2001 it has been leased to the New York amusement park company Six Flags.|$|E

2500|$|Foreign banks too {{started to}} appear, {{particularly}} in Calcutta, in the 1860s. Grindlays Bank opened its first branch in Calcutta in 1864. [...] The Comptoir d'Escompte de Paris opened a branch in Calcutta in 1860, {{and another in}} Bombay in 1862; branches followed in Madras and Pondicherry, then a French possession. HSBC established itself in Bengal in 1869. [...] Calcutta was the most active trading port in India, mainly due to the trade of the British Empire, and so became a <b>banking</b> <b>centre.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In an area {{dominated}} by authoritarian or militarist regimes, the Lebanese capital was {{generally regarded as}} a haven of libertarianism, though a precarious one. [...] With its seaport and airport—coupled with Lebanon's free economic and foreign exchange system, solid gold-backed currency, banking-secrecy law, and favourable interest rates—Beirut became an established <b>banking</b> <b>centre</b> for Arab wealth, much of which was invested in construction, commercial enterprise, and industry (mostly the manufacture of textiles and shoes, food processing, and printing). The economy of Beirut is diverse, including publishing, banking, trade and various industries. During that period, Beirut was the region's financial services center. At {{the onset of the}} oil boom starting in the 1960s, Lebanon-based banks were the main recipients of the region's petrodollars.|$|E
