This paper attempts to address this issue by reporting studies of the use of several different functionalised clays in the presence and absence of compatibilising PP copolymers and also to which the flame retardant, ammonium polyphosphate has been introduced. Compounded polymer samples have been characterised using XRD, optical and scanning electron microscopies and their melt flow indices (MFI).

In this contribution, the dependence on external heat flux of ignition delay time and steady mass flux of PMMA are investigated numerically. Ignition is modelled by the critical mass flux criterion.

In this experimental investigation, a direct observation approach {{was used to}} investigate the ignition, flame characteristics and combustion times by means of high-speed photography at 7000 frames per second. Single particles were entrained into a hot gas stream at 1340 K and a rapid heating rate of 104 – 105 K/s. The apparent volatile flames from the prepared particle size groups were observed within 20 – 50 ms. To assess the effect of oxygen concentration, particles were burned for their flame characteristics {{in a range of}} 10 %– 40 % O 2. The test particles were sieved into three size groups (215 – 255 μm, 255 – 300 μm and 300 – 350 μm) to assess the effect of particle size. Special particles for the co-firing effect were collected individually from two types of mixed pellet: 20 : 80 and 50 : 50 coal/wood. Pure sub-bituminous coal and wood particles were also prepared in order to compare their combustion behaviours. In the experimental setup with a cross-injection configuration, sequential combustion processes were effectively and clearly described in terms of particle displacement with time. The experimental results showed distinguishable flame characteristics from single particles of coal, 50 : 50 coal/wood, 20 : 80 coal/wood and wood, including soot flame size and intensity. The impact of high coal-blending ratio caused an increase in the flame size and intensity and the ignition time was close to that of pure coal particles. Quantitative measurements of combustion events on co-firing particles were also discussed in relation to significant impacts of the particle size and the oxygen concentration...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{the paper}} the linear form of burning rate law r=r 1 ·p, {{describing}} changes (in proportion to pressure p) in burning rate of propellants is reviewed. The linear form {{is one of}} many (but very popular) forms of burning rate law predicted to analysis and computer simulations of propellant gun systems operating and design process of gun. Coefficient r 1 of the linear form is usually calculated on the basis of average dimensions of grain (layer of burnt propellant) and integrated experimental pressure-time curve. Recorded picture of pressure of propellant gas mixture is an effect of closed vessel test. It is assumed that value of coefficient r 1 is constant (for given type of propellant) regardless of value of propellant gas pressure. Different fine-grained propellants (single-base and double-base) were fired in closed vessel tests to determine their <b>burning</b> rate <b>behaviour.</b> The variations in mass of igniter pad (black powder) at the same value of loading density were used. The results of experimental tests and calculations presented in this paper show significant influence of the used type of ignition system (mass of black powder) on burning rate (coefficient r 1) of propellant. The differences in calculations of propellant burning rate and computer simulations of pressure-travel history inside the barrel of a propellant gun system indicate that there are limitations to the validity of the linear form approach particularly for fine-grained propellants...|$|R
40|$|Co-firing {{tests with}} sawdust and coal {{have been carried}} out at FORTUM's Naantali- 3 CHP power plant (315 MWfuel). The Naantali- 3 plant is a tangentially-fired pulverised-coal unit with a Sulzer {{once-through}} boiler that produces 79 MW electricity, 124 MW district heat and 70 MW steam. Naantali- 3 is equipped with roller coal mills (Loesche), modern low-NOx-burners (IVO RI-JET), over-fire air (OFA), electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and flue-gas desulphurization plant (FGD). Coal and sawdust were blended in the coal yard, and the mixture fed into the boiler through coal mills. Tests were carried out for three months during the April 1999 to April 2000 period with pine sawdust (50 - 65 % moisture as received). During the tests, sawdust proportions of 2. 5 - 8 % (from the fuel input) were examined. The co-firing tests were successful in many ways, but the behaviour of the coal mills caused some problems, and therefore the simultaneous feed will not be the solution in a long-term use. Fortum has developed a new concept for co-firing coal and biofuels in large pulverised-coal fired boilers. The experiences gained from the Naantali co-firing tests and a good knowledge of low-NOx <b>burning</b> and combustion <b>behaviour</b> of different fuels at Fortum, was used when the new co-firing concept was developed. This concept consists of a separate biofuel grinding system and bio- or bio-coal-burners.

40|$|Each year, {{between one}} and three per cent of the total forested area in Victoria is fuel-reduced {{as a part of}} the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources' program to {{implement}} its overall fire protection policy. The dry sclerophyll Wombat State Forest has been fuel-reduced since the 1960 's, - a practise considered important because of its susceptibility to fire and its highly flammable plant community. This thesis presents the results of an evaluation of fuel-reduction burning in the Wombat State Forest, commencing with a review of forest conditions, principles of fuel-reduction <b>burning,</b> fire <b>behaviour</b> and fire effects. This is followed by observations and measurements in the field to document current practices of fuel-reduction burning, to select an appropriate fire-behaviour prediction model, to identify time-intervals between successive burns and to evaluate the effects of fuel-reduction burning on forest trees. Historical data of wildfires were used to evaluate the effectiveness of fuel-reduction burning in limiting the number, area and losses from wildfires. "Multi-criteria analysis" was then applied to select priority areas for fuel-reduction burning. The fuel-reduction burning program which is conducted 'every year during autumn and spring requires detailed planning and preparation, because it can only be carried out under certain prescriptions for weather, fuel and fire behaviour. Depending on the extent and conditions of each area, either ground or aerial ignition is applied. Large areas ignited from the air often result in variations of fire behaviour and intensity that leave many un-burnt patches within the broad areas of burnt forest. In order to predict fire-behaviour, comparisons were made between the Control Burning Meter, the McArthur Fire Danger Meter and the Fire Behaviour Tables for Western Australia (the Red Book). From a study of small trial plots, it was shown that the fire behaviour model incorporated in the Control Burning Meter for messmate-gum or silvertop forest type provided quite realistic predictions of low-intensity prescribed fires compared with predictions based on the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Meter and the Fire Behaviour Tables for Western Australia. Since its inception, fuel-reduction burning in the Wombat State Forest has decreased the quantity of litter and twigs, but it has had no significant effect on the quantity of humus and coarse fuels. This reduction of flammable fuels has reduced the potential for major fires and the study showed that a fuel-reduction burning cycle of less than five years is required to restrict the build up of fine fuels to acceptable levels. With regard to the impact of fuel-reduction burning, it was shown that it causes scorches on most trees, and that there is a significant relationship between scorch-height and tree diameter for the two dominant species, messmate (Eucalyptus obliqua L'Herit) and peppermint (E. radiata Sieb. ex. DC.). However, because of their different bark types, average scorch height was higher for messmate. Due to the considerable variation in the severity of fire seasons, hence in the frequency and severity of fire, no significant differences were detected in the number of wildfires and the extent of areas burnt, before and after the application of fuel-reduction burning in the Wombat State Forest. However, analysis of the historical fire data led to the conclusion that fuel-reduction burning has achieved its objective of limiting the severity of wildfires. Most of the wildfires occurred on areas that either had never been fuel-reduced or that had been fuel-reduced for more than five years. The costs of fuel-reduction burning have been relatively modest in comparison with the potential losses. Therefore, when properly planned and implemented, fuel-reduction burning is a valuable management tool for protecting forests and wider community values. This study has also provided a general idea on the applicability of "multi-criteria analysis" for identifying priority areas for fuel-reduction burning in the Wombat State Forest, with priority areas being selected on the basis of level of fire hazard (fuel, weather and topographical conditions) and values of particular sites (significant values, timber quality, distance from the nearest township and extent of the area). The result was a ranking of areas according to their priorities for burning. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R

The ER imparts good flame retardancy and non-dripping for polyethylene (PE) when combined with ammonium polyphosphate to yield an intumescent polyethylene (PE–IFR). The performance of this intumescent system has been enhanced {{by the addition of}} small amounts (0. 2 %) chelated copper(II) salicylaldehyde (CuSA) and salicylaldoxime, (CuSAO).

40|$|Promoted by the {{realisation}} of dwindling {{fossil fuel}} supplies and their adverse environmental impacts, there {{more and more}} types of alternative fuels to fossil diesel have been used and investigated in compression ignition engines. However, the majority of researches on alternative fuels mainly focus on their power performance, efficiency and emission performance, without fully investigating the potential effects on the vibro-acoustic emissions and tribological characteristics of engines caused by their significant differences in physical and chemical properties. Consequently, the impacts of long-term use of alternative fuels on structural failure, lubrication degradation, friction aggravation, overall service life spans and associated maintenance activities of internal combustion (IC) engines {{have not yet been}} fully understood. To reduce this gap this thesis focuses on the investigation into the vibration responses of cylinder liners in a diesel engine to accurately characterises the tribological behaviour between the piston rings and cylinders {{which is one of the}} most decisive sub-processes that determine engine performance and yet is correlated with the combustion of different fuels. In particular, the investigation was carried out by coupling the hydrodynamic lubrication model with structural vibration effects through a series of extensive numerical simulations and systematic experimental evaluations in order to establish a vibration based technique to monitoring tribological behaviour and thereby accurately assess the influence. Based on the dynamic coupling mechanisms between the combustion characteristics of alternative fuels and the tribological behaviours of cylinder liners, the most significant influences from the fuel <b>burning</b> on tribological <b>behaviour</b> of cylinder liners concerned in this study is a direct and physical approach such as the effect of liner vibrations on cylinder friction process, even though an indirect and chemical but very slow approach such as the deterioration of oil properties by combustion products can happen. To characterise the direct influence a finite element dynamic model was developed and validated for predicting the dynamic responses of cylinder liners to respective excitation sources including the highly nonlinear combustion pressure shocks and subsequent piston slap impacts. The realistic consideration of both the characteristics of structural modes up to 15 kHz and nonlinearities of elastic assembly constraints allows obtaining accurate prediction that the combustion shocks cause vibrations in a frequency range around 10 kHz with an amplitude order of 0. 01 μm, whereas the piston slaps in frequency range from 1 k to 5 kHz with an amplitude order 0. 2 μm, which gives a clear and quantitative indication of the nonlinear phenomena of liner vibration due to combusting alternative fuels and varying lubrication conditions. In addition, a decomposition analysis of piston side-thrust forces provides more insight of the localized response characteristics corresponding to coupling interactions of combustion force with inertia force of piston assembly. To further investigate the potential influences of structural deformations to tribological behaviours of cylinder assemblies, a new dynamic deformation based lubrication model was developed based on an employment of improved shearing factors in which the effect of inevitable liner vibrations is included to obtain a more realistic lubricating film formation, distribution and tribological behaviours. The simulation studies show that this advancement in modelling oil films predicts that the biodiesel with more intense vibration emissions is able to reduce the friction loss between pistons and liners, whereas the methanol-diesel blend with weakened liner dynamic response may exacerbate the friction loss of IC engines. This finding confirms further that the vibration responses allow a straightforward and in-depth indication of the effect generated by using different fuels. In addition, a further experimental investigation was carried out based on a motoring engine test, in which high frequency sinusoidal vibrations at 25 kHz, 30 kHz and 40 kHz are added to the external surface of the linear. The observable changes in motoring torque verify that proper external vibrations can affect the tribological behaviours between the pistons and liners, including both asperity friction and viscous friction, and resulting in the friction reduction of IC engines. Particularly the 40 kHz vibration at the maximal driving power of the test device can achieve a reduction of 1. 79...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the <b>burning</b> <b>behaviour</b> of litter fuels is {{essential}} before developing a {{complete understanding of}} wildfire spread. The challenge of predicting the fire behaviour of such fuels arises from their porous nature and from the strong coupling of the physico-chemical complexities of the fuel with the surrounding environment, which controls the burning dynamics. In this work, a method is presented to accurately understand the processes which control the <b>burning</b> <b>behaviour</b> of a wildland fuel layer using numerical simulations coupled with laboratory experiments. Simulations are undertaken with ForestFireFOAM, a modification of FireFOAM that uses a Large Eddy Simulation solver to represent porous fuel by implementing a multiphase formulation to conservation equations (mass, momentum, and energy). This approach allows the fire- induced behaviour of a porous, reactive and radiative medium to be simulated. Conservation equations are solved in an averaged control volume at a scale su cient to contain both coexisting gas and solid phases, considering strong coupling between the phases. Processes such as drying, pyrolysis, and char combustion are described through temperature-dependent interaction between the solid and gas phases. Di↵erent sub-models for heat transfer, pyrolysis, gas combustion, and smouldering have been implemented and tested to allow better representation of these combustion processes. Numerical simulations are compared with experiments undertaken in a controlled environment using the FM Global Fire Propagation Apparatus. Pine needle beds of varying densities and surface to volume ratios were subject to radiative heat fluxes and flows to interrogate the ignition and combustion behaviour. After including modified descriptions of the heat transfer, degradation, and combustion models, it is shown that key flammability parameters of mass loss rates, heat release rates, gas emissions and temperature fields agree well with experimental observations. Using this approach, {{we are able to}} provide the appropriate modifications to represent the <b>burning</b> <b>behaviour</b> of complex wildland fuels in a range of conditions representative of real fires.

40|$|Phosphorus-containing {{alternatives}} {{have increasingly}} substituted halogen-containing flame retardants in the flame retardancy of PBT. Unfortunately, {{most of the}} flame retardants dete-riorate the mechanical properties of PBT or tend to bloom. Despite their common usage, a detailed understanding of how <b>burning</b> <b>behaviour</b> and material properties {{are influenced by the}} chemical structure of the flame retardants is still missing. The knowledge about the influence of the material's macrostructure on <b>burning</b> <b>behaviour</b> and flame retardancy demands is incomplete, too. In this study, phosphorus polyesters are presented as an alternative to commonly used low-molecular additives for the flame retardancy of compact, glass fibre reinforced and foamed PBT. The pyrolysis and <b>burning</b> <b>behaviour</b> of these polyesters is discussed. The macrostructure of PBT as well as the chemical structure of the phosphorus polyesters was systematically varied to deduce the corresponding structure-property relationships. Glass fibre reinforced PBT has a higher flammability than compact PBT, while PBT integral foam has a higher risk of flame spread. The presence of bridging groups and P-O-Carom. -bonds in the phosphorus substituent of the phosphorus polyesters increases their char-forming ability and their condensed-phase activity, respectively. The nature of the active flame-retardancy mechanisms determines the fire risks, which are reduced. One of the phosphorus polyesters, PET-P-DOPO, forms an immiscible blend with PBT. PET-P-DOPO has a good flame-retardancy performance and deteriorates the mechanical properties less than common flame retardants. Additionally, it still has the potential for further optimisation. An improved miscibility and a higher phosphorus content would improve the mechanical properties and the flame-retardancy performance, respectively. PET-P-DOPO is less suited to flame retard PBT integral foam. In glass fibre reinforced PBT, however, PET-P-DOPO outperforms common flame-retardant additives even if they are used with a higher phospho-rus content than PET-P-DOPO. The results essentially contribute to the understanding of fundamental structure-property relationships in flame retardancy of polymers. They permit to predict specific flame-retardancy demands from the material's macrostructure. Furthermore, the results allow a more specific selection and optimisation of existing flame retardants through the modification of their chemical structure and a targeted design of new flame retardants for specific applica-tions or protection goals, respectively. A promising alternative to common additives for the flame retardancy of PBT was found with PET-P-DOPO...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} decomposition and burning behaviours of polyurethane foams experimentally and compares the experimental results obtained with the numerical {{results from the}} pyrolysis model of Fire Dynamics Simulator, Version 5 (FDS 5). Based on the comparison of model and experimental heat release rates, {{the accuracy of the}} pyrolysis model is quantified. In total, this research tested seven polyurethane foams consisting of three non-fire retardant (NFR) and four fire retardant (FR) foams. According to the simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis (SDT) experiments, the decomposition behaviour of polyurethane foams under nitrogen environment is represented by two pyrolysis reactions. The first reaction consists of foam decomposition into melts and gases while the second reaction consists of the decomposition of the remaining melts into gases. The kinetic properties which govern the rate of decomposition are the activation energy (E), pre-exponential factor (A), reaction order (n) and heat of reaction (Δhr). Using graphical techniques, E, A and n of the first and second reactions are determined from the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results. Through analysing the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results, Δhr is determined from the changes in heat flow and sample mass. The thermophysical properties govern the heat transfer through material and these are the thermal conductivity (λ) and specific heat (cp) which are measured experimentally at ambient temperature through the Hot Disk method. Through the Sample Feeding Vertical Cone, the decomposition and melting behaviours of polyurethane foams in a vertical orientation are investigated and the foams tested can be categorised into those which produce melts only after ignition and those which produce melts and char after ignition. The 1 -dimensional <b>burning</b> <b>behaviour</b> of foams is obtained from the cone calorimeter experiments. The NFR foams show a change from plateau <b>burning</b> <b>behaviour</b> at low heat flux to two stage <b>burning</b> <b>behaviour</b> at high heat flux while the FR foams consistently show two stage <b>burning</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The combustion property governs the amount of heat released when fuel combusts and this is the effective heat of combustion (Δhc,eff) which is determined from the heat released and mass consumed in the cone experiment. The 1 -dimensional <b>burning</b> <b>behaviour</b> is simulated using the pyrolysis model of FDS 5 and two different modelling approaches are considered. The direct method uses the material properties determined experimentally as FDS 5 inputs while the refined method uses the genetic algorithm of Gpyro to refine the kinetic properties which are later used as FDS 5 inputs. The heat release rate of the model and experiment are compared through linear regression analysis which quantifies the accuracy of both methods. The accuracy is defined as the percentage of data points within the boundary of acceptance which is bounded by 25 % of the greatest experimental heat release rate. This assessment method places greater emphasis on the accuracy of developed burning phases and lesser emphasis on the accuracy of initial growth and final decay. The accuracy of the direct method is found to be 56 % while the refined method with estimated kinetic properties achieves a higher accuracy of 75 %. The 2 -dimensional burning behaviours are investigated in the foam slab experiments for two different slab thicknesses, 120 and 100 mm. The opposed-flow spread of 120 mm slab is more intense and rapid while for the 100 mm slab, the flame spread is less intense and slow. FDS 5 is used to simulate the experimental results but when the material properties either developed experimentally or refined by Gpyro are used as inputs, the model fails to produce flame spread. This is because FDS 5 does not yet have the features which address the dynamics of foam melting and the reactive nature of the flame. In order to produce flame spread in the model, E of the reactions have been reduced to increase the decomposition rate...|$|E

As this oil is an intermediate product and has little commercial value, {{there has been little}} characterisation of the <b>burning</b> <b>behaviour</b> or propensity for boilover of the fuel. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the global <b>burning</b> <b>behaviour</b> of untreated heavy gas oil in the effort to document key fire parameters and unique burning characteristics of the fuel, and compare with those presented in literature. This experimental series consisted of measurements of the heat release rate, rate of fuel consumption, and flame spread rate, as well as observations of overall pool fire behaviour, using heavy gas oil as well as kerosene as a reference. Further experiments investigated the effects of water suppression spray on the pool fire behaviour, and the propensity for boilover during small-scale fires. It was found that the fire properties of heavy gas oil were consistent with those of other heavy oils, most notably those of heavy fuel oil. The <b>burning</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the heavy gas oil was well represented by the traditional correlations for fire behaviour of heavy hydrocarbon fuels. Some of the measured properties for the heavy gas oil included an infinite diameter fuel regression rate of 3. 0 mm/min, heat of combustion of 43. 5 MJ/kg, and flame spread rate of 0. 8 cm/s. Temperatures measured through the depth of the fuel layer indicated that a hot-zone did not form, and the observation was confirmed based on mass burning rates and fuel boiling temperatures that did not vary over the burning duration. At low initial fuel temperatures, the burning of the heavy gas oil was intensified by water emulsified within the oil, which led to an increase in each of the measured fire characteristics, especially that of flame spread rate. In this case, small volumes of flaming oil were projected out of the test pans, as well as into the flame column. Furthermore, the heavy gas oil was found to ‘weather’ over time, resulting in an oil with higher density and lower volatility, which caused each of the measured fire properties to decrease during the six month weathering period considered here. The heavy gas oil in the present experiments was found to have a significant propensity to mix with steam, forming a froth-like substance that expanded in volume across the surface of the fuel. This phenomenon was observed when suppression water was sprayed on the heated fuel surface, as well as in fires established over deep pools of fuel with a water sublayer. The expansion of the froth resulted in overflow of burning fuel from the experimental test pans, and thus caused fire spread beyond the pan walls. Finally, thin layer boilover was observed in heavy gas oil pool fires with a water sublayer, leading to both an increase in fire intensity and fire spread beyond the test pans...|$|E

Problems are caused by an imense emission of combustion products with air pollutants like CO, NO sub x and soot. In this paper TNT was studied in an incineration apparatus in laboratory scale. The <b>burning</b> <b>behaviour</b> and fluegas products are described.

In this study the <b>burning</b> <b>behaviour</b> in correlation to the tracer composition and the pressure is examined in the ICT optical bomb in air at 15 kPa to 100 kPa and 100 kPa nitrogen. Three tracer compositions with various oxygen balances were investigated using high speed photography and UV/Vis/NIR-spectrometry. The results indicate a strong correlation of sub-atmospheric pressure and the oxygen balance of the tracer composition with respect to ignition behaviour, burning temperature and luminance which is in a well agreement to ballistic firing test...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} develop new fire retardant rubber formulations, by surveying the existing knowledge base for fire retardant approaches for polyisoprene rubber, characterising unmodified compounds, formulating and studying fire retarded compounds for use within suspension and anti-vibration mounting systems. Materials have been prepared on a bench scale and evaluated for physical properties. Thermal decomposition has been studied using Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) in both air and nitrogen. <b>Burning</b> <b>behaviour</b> has been studied using a horizontal burning rate method, Limiting Oxygen Index (LOI) and the cone calorimeter. Basic rubber mixtures were prepared to investigate the interactions between the polymer and additives, under TGA conditions. Zinc oxide {{was found to have}} little effect on the polymer decomposition, while silica reduced thermal stability. When decomposed in air, increasing levels of carbon black reduce the rate of mass loss in the polymer. Comparing formulations with different cross-linking types, sulphur without cross-linking increases the heat release in a cone calorimeter; but when low levels of sulphur form efficient cross-links, heat release is suppressed, as also occurs with organic peroxide cross-linking. The effect of carbon black on <b>burning</b> <b>behaviour</b> was compared with inorganic fillers. Within the cone calorimeter, material containing carbon black formed a char-like residue which provides some reduction in the rate heat release, and did not contribute to the fuel load. The use of inorganic fillers yielded more rapid <b>burning</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Any level of carbon black addition gives a reduction in the rates of heat, smoke, CO, and CO 2 release, confirming that carbon black had a stabilising effect. Intumescent formulations were prepared using ammonium polyphosphate (APP), pentaerythritol and melamine, and separately using expandable graphite (EG). Within the cone calorimeter both systems yielded a significant reduction in the first peak of heat release rate, but a much higher second peak than for the unmodified compound. This second peak value is associated with the significant levels of intumescence observed. The use of EG gave a greater level of fire retardance compared to the APP formulation. Hydrated fillers, and blends thereof, were investigated; an equal blend of aluminium hydroxide (ATH) and magnesium hydroxide (MH) was found to yield the lowest peak release rate on the cone calorimeter. Hydrated fillers were investigated with synergists proposed in the literature. Little benefit was noted for these additives when used as partial replacements for the filler...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} method {{based on the}} theory and experimental techniques of differential scanning calorimeter is proposed to investigate {{the determination of the}} heat of reaction for wood in experiments with and without crucible lids. It is found that the heat exchange dynamics are different for the two cases during decomposition which causes the rate of energy transfer to differ and the values of heat of reaction to vary quantitatively. However, these results still demonstrate consistent energy absorbing and releasing behaviour during the decomposition process in both lid scenarios. In addition, the quantitative differences for the heat of reaction only have a weak effect on the predictions of <b>burning</b> <b>behaviour</b> for cone calorimeter simulations in Fire Dynamics Simulator...|$|E
40|$|The <b>burning</b> <b>behaviour</b> of {{more than}} 120 electrostatically-sprayed {{water-based}} paints was tested, and the paints were classified into the three categories 'non-burning', 'non self-sustaining burning' and 'self-sustaining burning.

The burning tests resulted in an unique diagram and in an equation {{which can be used}} to assess the non-flammability of sprays of any water-based paint with an organic solvent based on butyl glycol or butyl diglycol if their mass content of inorganic solid, organic solid, organic solvent and water is known.

The IR range shows the molecule bands of HBO 2. In both cases we measured in the ignition region {{and at the end of}} the combustor. The received spectra seemed to be similar but had different background radiation, due to the ignition phenomena. This effect we observed in the optical bomb, too. The hot gases contained a small amount of glowing particles, which led to a very low continuum in the IR spectrum and consequently showed the efficient <b>burning</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the boron during the short residence time in the combustion chamber...|$|E

Due to their porous structures they show high burning rates in comparison to conventional gun propellants based on nitrocellulose. Energy content and material characteristics such as <b>burning</b> <b>behaviour</b> can be varied by using different energetic fillers, energetic polymers and porous structures. Therefore the foaming process has a great influence on the material properties {{and quality of the}} foamed propellants. This paper outlines results received by various measurements using a specific laboratory equipment to characterise the foaming process. Parameters as rise height and rise profile are the classic methods.

40|$|A {{new test}} method for testing of fire {{properties}} of mattresses is proposed. The method {{is intended to}} evaluate the full scale <b>burning</b> <b>behaviour</b> of a complete mattress or bed system when exposed to a flaming ignition source. Fire performance criteria, for mattresses used in public occupancies, are proposed. The criteria are intended to give protection against fully developed fires in mattresses in the event of, for example, arson, in premises where people may be prevented from escape. A test series has been performed, on 10 mattresses from the market place, to demonstrate the test method proposed. The test results show that mattresses exist {{on the market today}} that meets the proposed criteria.

40|$|Ferrocenes like 2, 2 '-Bis(ethylferrocenyl) propane (Catocene(R)) {{are capable}} {{to enhance the}} burning rates of {{composit}} propellants significantly without effecting performance, processing and mechanical properties detrimentally. Their disadvantages are a tendency of migration and facilitation of oxidation by air. In this way they spoiled aging behaviour and reliability of the propellant, reduced its lifetime and enhanced its sensitivity. To avoid drawbacks and make a propellant with improved durability, new ferrocene compounds with bulk ligands and functional derivatives like Butacene(r) which are capable of chemical binding to the HTPB polymer were tested in formulations of a fast burning composite propellant. The <b>burning</b> <b>behaviour,</b> processing and mechanical properties of AP/Al/HTPB formulations with different concentrations of ferrocene were evaluated and compared to each other.
