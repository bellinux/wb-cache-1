Our goal was to generate high-precision DEMs in tidal flat areas, because accurate intertidal zone data are essential for monitoring coastal environment sand erosion processes. To monitor dynamic coastal changes caused by waves, currents, and tides, very accurate DEMs with high spatial resolution are required.

40|$|Develop Circular Synthetic Aperture Sonar (CSAS) {{techniques}} and signal processing algorithms to generate high resolution acoustic images {{of mine and}} non-mine targets using bistatic and multistatic sonar configurations. OBJECTIVES The objective of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) based bistatic CSAS imaging of bottom mines and mine-like targets, to evaluate and compare the quality of bistatic imaging relative to monostatic imaging, and to determine the practical advantages (or disadvantages) of bistatic imaging with respect to monostatic imaging. APPROACH Most synthetic aperture sonar (and radar) systems operate in a monostatic mode in which the source and receiver are collocated. To generate a monostatic CSAS image, the target region is partially or completely circled by the sonar and echoes are acquired over a large range of target aspects. Detailed images of target outlines can be produced from this data even at relatively low transmit frequencies (tens of kHz) [1, 3]. In the <b>bistatic</b> <b>mode,</b> the source and receiver are separated in space and the geometry considerations are somewhat more complicated [2, 3]. Under this task, bistatic CSAS imaging algorithms have been developed as extensions to the monostatic CSAS imaging algorithms previously developed at ARL:UT. Bistatic CSAS image processing is based upon Fourier Transform reconstruction techniques {{similar to those in}} [4 - 6] with significant modifications to accommodate the bistatic configuration [1, 3]. ...|$|E

EISS can operate in both a monostatic and bistatic configuration, the latter being made possible by the simultaneous operation of two separate instrument platforms.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new dual circularly polarized antenna for {{ground penetrating radar}} applications. The new antenna design uses four crossed Resistive-Vee Dipoles (RVD) operating in <b>bistatic</b> <b>mode</b> to measure multiple polarizations. The antenna system is able to distinguish radially symmetric and linear targets with its ability to transmit right-hand circularly polarized (RHCP) fields and receive both left-hand circularly polarized (LHCP) and RHCP scattered fields. The type of target can be identified by comparing the relative amplitudes of the received LHCP fields and RHCP fields. For example, linear targets such as wires may be identified by equal amounts of scattered LHCP and RHCP fields. Numerical modeling was used to optimize {{the arrangement of the}} four RVDs in the RVD-based CP antenna to have low coupling and good circular polarization at close range. The resulting antenna design is shown to be very effective at finding buried wire targets without being costly. Additional modeling was performed to improve the circular polarization by changing the arm shape and resistive profile of the RVDs. Three methods are developed for estimating the spatial orientation angle of a detected wire target. The first method involves synthesizing transmission and reception of linear polarization at many angles to find the angle that matches the angle of the wire target. The second and third methods involve directly computing the angle of the wire target from the phase difference in the co-polarization and cross-polarization responses. All three methods provide accurate estimates. The RVD-based CP antenna enables strong detection of subsurface targets along with geometry-based classification of targets. The RVD-based CP antenna is well suited for finding buried wires and rejecting miscellaneous clutter that may be present in the ground. Ph. D...|$|E
40|$|Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (Pol‐InSAR) {{has been}} {{proven to be a}} {{powerful}} radar remote sensing technique for the investigation of natural volume scatterers. The coherent combination of single‐ or multi‐baseline interferograms acquired at different polarisations provides sensitivity to the vertical distribution of scattering processes and allows their characterisation by using the associated (complex) interferometric coherences. However, in repeat‐pass spaceborne implementations, the inherent presence of temporal decorrelation is biasing the interferometric coherence estimates degrading the sensitivity to vertical scattering structure and limiting the performance of Pol‐InSAR inversion techniques. This is the main reason why polarimetric space‐borne missions could not contribute essential neither with respect to large scale demonstration of Pol‐InSAR techniques nor for the development of new Pol‐InSAR applications areas. TanDEM‐X – successfully launched in June 2010 – forms together with TerraSAR‐X the first single‐pass polarimetric interferometer in space. This allows {{for the first time the}} acquisition and analysis of Single‐, Dual‐, and Quad‐Pol‐InSAR data without the disturbing effect of temporal decorrelation. Even if X‐band has ‐ when compared to lower frequencies ‐ a reduced penetration capability recent airborne experiments demonstrated several cases where a rather surprising penetration into natural volume scatterers ‐ as vegetation and ice ‐ could be proven. In this sense, the investigation of the Tandem‐X Pol‐InSAR data sets will strongly contribute to our understanding of scattering processes at X‐band and potential new Pol‐InSAR applications. In this presentation, first Pol‐InSAR TanDEM‐X datasets over a number of sites distributed across worldwide are investigated with respect to interferometric volumetric effects in order to provide first insights on the potential of the TanDEM‐X mission for characterisation of natural volume scaterers.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the usefulness of global positioning system (GPS) receivers for relative positioning of formation-flying satellites using dual-frequency carrier-phase observations. The accurate determination of distances or baselines between satellites flying in formation can provide significant benefits to a wide area of geodetic studies. For spaceborne radar interferometry in particular, such measurements will improve the accuracy of interferometric products such as digital elevation models (DEM) or surface deformation maps. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the impact of relative position errors on the interferometric baseline performance of multistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites flying in such a formation. Based on accuracy results obtained from differential GPS (DGPS) observations between the twin gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) satellites, baseline uncertainties are derived for three interferometric scenarios of a dedicated SAR mission. For cross-track interferometry in a <b>bistatic</b> operational <b>mode,</b> a mean 2 D baseline error (1 σ) of 1. 4 mm is derived, whereas baseline estimates necessary for a monostatic acquisition mode with a 50 km along-track separation reveal a 2 D uncertainty of approximately 1. 7 mm. Absolute orbit solutions based on reduced dynamic orbit determination techniques using GRACE GPS code and carrier-phase data allows a repeat-pass baseline estimation with an accuracy down to 4 cm (2 D 1 σ). To assess the accuracy with respect to quality requirements of high-resolution DEMs, topographic height errors are derived from the estimated baseline uncertainties. Taking the monostatic pursuit flight configuration as the worst case for baseline performance, the analysis reveals that the induced low-frequency modulation (height bias) fulfills the relative vertical accuracy requirement (σ smaller than 1 m linear point-to-point error) according to the digital terrain elevation data level 3 (DTED- 3) specifications for most of the baseline constellations. The use of a GPS-based reduced dynamic orbit determination technique improves the baseline performance for repeat-pass interferometry. The problem of fulfilling the DTED- 3 horizontal accuracy requirements is still an issue to be investigated. DGPS can be used as an operational navigation tool for high-precision baseline estimation if a geodetic-grade dual-frequency spaceborne GPS receiver is assumed to be the primary instrument onboard the SAR satellites. The possibility of using only single-frequency receivers, however, requires further research effort...|$|R
