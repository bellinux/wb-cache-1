500|$|On Valentine's Day in 1921, while Scott {{was working}} {{to finish his}} second novel, The Beautiful and Damned, Zelda {{discovered}} she was pregnant. They {{decided to go to}} Scott's home in St. Paul, Minnesota to have the baby. On October 26, 1921, she gave birth to Frances [...] "Scottie" [...] Fitzgerald. As she emerged from the anesthesia, Scott recorded Zelda saying, [...] "Oh, God, goofo I'm drunk. Mark Twain. Isn't she smart—she has the hiccups. I hope it's beautiful and a fool—a <b>beautiful</b> <b>little</b> fool." [...] Many of her words found their way into Scott's novels: in The Great Gatsby, the character Daisy Buchanan expresses a similar hope for her daughter.|$|E
500|$|A few reviewers {{were pleased}} by the new {{friendship}} between Rory and Sam. Kubicek said it was [...] "officially my favorite thing from the entire third season of Glee", and Bell approved, though she said [...] "the writers don't know how to use" [...] Rory, and was disappointed that his brotherly relationship with Finn had [...] "fizzled". VanDerWerff singled out Rory's reading from the bible, which was, as Canning phrased it, [...] "ripped from A Charlie Brown Christmas" [...] when Linus reads the same passage, as one that [...] "irks" [...] him most, [...] "because it takes a perfectly <b>beautiful</b> <b>little</b> moment from a nearly perfect TV special" [...] and makes it a [...] "cutaway gag".|$|E

500|$|During his journey, {{while waiting}} for a Mississippi steamboat, Uncle Tom first meets little Eva, who with her father is also taking the boat south. Tom is at once {{attracted}} to the <b>beautiful</b> <b>little</b> girl, and she in turn talks to the kindly old darkey. While looking at the boats, the little one accidentally falls into the swiftly flowing river and escapes drowning only through the bravery of Uncle Tom. He of all the crowd has the courage to jump in and rescue the little girl. Eva's father to reward Tom for his bravery, buys him from Legree, and once more Tom {{knows what it is}} to be treated kindly. He lives happily as little Eva's special bodyguard until the little one is seized with a sudden sickness and dies. She had become greatly attached to Uncle Tom, and the last act of her life was to present him with a little locket containing her picture. Once more Uncle Tom is sold and again falls into the hands of Simon Legree. He is taken to Legree's plantation in Mississippi, where he is overworked and ill-treated to the point of death. Just before he dies he presses to his lips the locket with the picture of his beloved little girl and in a vision sees her in the clouds holding out her arms to him that he, too, may enter with her the pearly gates, inside of which all souls are equal, and all free. The comedy of the story is furnished by little Eva's Aunt Ophelia, a queer old lawyer named Marx, and his stubborn donkey, to say nothing of Topsy, a wicked little colored girl, who Aunt Ophelia tries hard to convert." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for The Wall Street Journal, Joe Morgenstern {{described}} Like Crazy as a [...] "wise and <b>beautiful</b> <b>little</b> film", giving particular praise to Guleserian's cinematography and Yelchin and Jones's improvised performances. David Edelstein of New York magazine claimed that Like Crazy was [...] "the most infectious love story in decades", comparing its [...] "wonderfully sane" [...] perspective to other romance films and romantic comedies. Entertainment Weekly Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the film an A– grade and praised Doremus, Yelchin and Felicity Jones's storytelling ability in creating [...] "a palpably real, universally identifiable manifestation of young love {{in all its}} ecstasy and agony". In a review for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, writing that [...] "Drake Doremus has crafted a crazily inventive and totally irresistible tale of first love that makes the familiar seem bittersweet and heart-stoppingly new". He described Felicity Jones as [...] "a marvel" [...] and Yelchin as [...] "outstanding". Time magazine's Mary Pols commended the film's ambiguous ending and wrote, [...] "Like Crazy is a cinematic love potion and you leave it feeling bewitched." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, praising Jones and Yelchin's performances and the [...] "intelligent, graceful indie style" [...] of the film, although he found the storyline somewhat unrealistic. Indiewire's Eric Kohn gave the film a B+ grade and felt that while the plot developed slowly, Yelchin and Jones shared [...] "an indelible and entirely realistic chemistry". Variety film critic Andrew Barker, who described the film as [...] "an exquisite, beautifully acted gem", gave particular praise to the film's [...] "dexterous editing", given that it [...] "contains nary an extraneous detail, while still managing to luxuriate in the tender and awkward silences of young love".|$|E

6000|$|Fritz is still, {{if not in}} [...] "long-clothes," [...] {{at least}} in longish and flowing clothes, of the {{petticoat}} sort, which look as of dark-blue velvet, very simple, pretty and appropriate; in a cap of the same; has a short raven's feather in the cap; and looks up, with a face and eyes full of beautiful vivacity and child's enthusiasm, one of the <b>beautifulest</b> <b>little</b> figures, while the little drum responds to his bits of drumsticks. Sister Wilhelmina, taller by some three years, looks on in pretty marching attitude, and with a graver smile.

2500|$|Despite {{continued}} {{attempts at}} maintaining the theatre, it declined {{over the next}} 3 decades. By the 1940s, the performers had to beware of holes in the stage, unsafe wiring, faulty heating, and cockroaches. Unsafe conditions eventually led to a planned demolition. In 1948, Sir Laurence Olivier arrived in Hobart {{as part of the}} Old Vic touring company and spoke passionately about the theatre, launching a national appeal; [...] "We appreciate playing in it not only because it is a <b>beautiful</b> <b>little</b> theatre; it is more than that. Your parents and grandparents have sat here as audience. Our parents have acted on this stage. In the one hundred and eleven years it has been played in it has built up atmosphere and the secret of atmosphere is antiquity. Don’t let it go." ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{took her}} hand in his and pressed it, and smiled at her. [...] "Yes, Carley, it's a <b>beautiful,</b> soft <b>little</b> hand. But I think I'd like it better if it were strong and brown, and coarse on the inside--from useful work." ...|$|R

2500|$|O'Reilly was {{remembered as}} witty, kindly, generously tolerant, and sensitive. Though {{he did not}} feel {{challenged}} by his work as a schoolmaster, he had a good understanding of boys and gained their affection. Not long before his death he wrote of himself: [...] "I am a failure; I have attempted many things, writing, teaching, politics, drifted along, done just enough to live." [...] This feeling of frustration and failure was characteristic. His early verse was seldom of more than average quality, but the little selection published in 1924 with Tears and Triumph and Five Corners, under the title of The Prose and Verse of Dowell O'Reilly, shows him to be a poet, however limited in output and scope. Five Corners contains some of the best Australian short stories ever written. [...] "His Photo on the wall" [...] is considered a masterpiece for its mingling of humour and tragedy, and his <b>beautiful</b> <b>little</b> sketch, [...] "Twilight" [...] is a triumph in economy of means. O'Reilly wrote so little perhaps because of his tendency towards self-criticism. He was known as a perfectionist.|$|E
2500|$|She {{was born}} around 1690–1692 {{and given the}} name Sarah Pridden. Her father was a bricklayer. At the age of nine she was apprenticed to a {{seamstress}} in Aldgate. After losing a valuable piece of lace she ran away and took to life {{on the streets of}} the slum district of St Giles. Here she turned to various forms of street trading. She became well known in London as [...] "the <b>beautiful</b> <b>little</b> wench who sells pamphlets to the schoolboys and apprentices...in Pope's Head Alley in the City of London", but her pamphlet sales were merely a sideline to her more lucrative trade, charging the boys half a crown for an hour of her time. The notorious roué Colonel Francis Charteris made her his mistress, but abandoned her when she was 14, after which she was taken in by the bawd, Mother Wisebourne, whose house in Covent Garden was among the most exclusive and expensive brothels of the time. She adopted the name Salisbury from one of her lovers. After Wisebourne's death she moved on to the house of Mother Needham in Park Place.|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, Jack Warner {{spoke of}} the [...] "magic quality that {{transformed}} this sometimes bland and not <b>beautiful</b> <b>little</b> girl into a great artist," [...] and in a 1988 interview, Davis remarked that, unlike many of her contemporaries, she had forged a career {{without the benefit of}} beauty. She admitted she was terrified during the making of her earliest films and that she became tough by necessity. [...] "Until you're known in my profession as a monster, you are not a star," [...] she said, [...] " [...] I've never fought for anything in a treacherous way. I've never fought for anything but the good of the film." [...] During the making of All About Eve, (1950) Joseph L. Mankiewicz told her of the perception in Hollywood that she was difficult, and she explained that when the audience saw her on screen, they did not consider that her appearance was the result of numerous people working behind the scenes. If she was presented as [...] "a horse's ass ... forty feet wide, and thirty feet high," [...] that is all the audience [...] "would see or care about." ...|$|E
