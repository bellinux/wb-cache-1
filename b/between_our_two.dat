The band traveled to Havana—bringing along their camera crew—on May 4 to spend two days visiting historic sites and interacting with Cuban musicians and youngsters.

[...] The trip was organized with the joint authorization of the United States Department of the Treasury and the Instituto Cubano de la Musica (Cuban Institute of Music), as travel by U.S. citizens to Cuba is restricted, but the authorization arrived so late that the band had to cancel and postpone several confirmed dates of their U.S. tour.

40|$|Abstract—Receiving great {{interest}} {{from the research}} com-munity, Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) are a type of Next Generation Networks (NGNs) proposed to bridge communication in challenged environments. In this paper, the message replication probability is proportionally sprayed for efficient routing mainly under sparse scenario. This methodology {{is different from the}} spray based algorithms using message copy ticket to control repli-cation. Our heuristic algorithm aims to overcome the scalability of spray based algorithms since to determine the initial value of copy ticket requires the assumption that either the number of nodes known in advance or the underlying mobility model follows the Random WayPoint (RWP) characteristic. Specifically, in combining with the assistance of geographic information to estimate the movement range of destination, our routing decision is based on the encounter angle between pairwise nodes, and dynamically switched <b>between</b> <b>our</b> designed <b>two</b> routing phases named as geographic replication and replication probability spray. Furthermore, messages are under transmission with the consideration of redundancy pruning. Simulation results show our heuristic algorithm outperforms other well known algorithms in terms of delivery ratio, transmission overhead, average latency as well as buffer occupancy time. I...|$|R
