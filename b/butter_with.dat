5|$|Beurre Maître d'Hôtel is a savory butter {{prepared}} by mixing softened <b>butter</b> <b>with</b> very finely minced parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper. A ratio of around 1.5 tablespoons of parsley to two ounces of butter may be used. Additional ingredients may include shallot and Worcestershire sauce. Vinegar is sometimes used, although its inclusion is rare. Cayenne pepper {{has also been}} used. After mixing, it is typically rolled in parchment paper or plastic wrap and chilled to harden.|$|E

25|$|Clarified {{butter is}} <b>butter</b> <b>with</b> {{almost all of}} its water and milk solids removed, leaving almost-pure butterfat. Clarified butter is made by heating butter to its melting point and then {{allowing}} it to cool; after settling, the remaining components separate by density. At the top, whey proteins form a skin, which is removed. The resulting butterfat is then poured off from the mixture of water and casein proteins that settle to the bottom.|$|E

25|$|The town {{is known}} for {{gingerbread}} biscuits which were first made in 1740 by William Eggleston. Eggleston, a baker by trade, was a producer of a biscuit called Grantham Whetstones. Whetsones were a rusk like dry biscuit enjoyed locally and also by coach drivers who used to stop in Grantham to change their horses whilst travelling on the Great North road. According to folklore, Egglestone, whilst baking whetsones in his dimly lit kitchen one morning, mistook one ingredient for another, resulting in a ginger-like biscuit {{to emerge from the}} oven. The mistake was a huge success and the biscuit became established as Grantham gingerbread, known as a white gingerbread because it is not made with molasses or black treacle. This provides a delicate ginger flavour, rich in <b>butter,</b> <b>with</b> a domed top that has a crackled surface. The centre is hollow and resembles a honeycomb.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} known European {{reference to}} the durian is the record of Niccolò Da Conti, who travelled to southeastern Asia in the 15th century. Translated from the Latin in which Poggio Bracciolini recorded Da Conti's travels: [...] "They [...] have a green fruit which they call durian, {{as big as a}} watermelon. Inside there are five things like elongated oranges, and resembling thick <b>butter,</b> <b>with</b> a combination of flavours." [...] The Portuguese physician Garcia de Orta described durians in Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India published in 1563. In 1741, Herbarium Amboinense by the German botanist Georg Eberhard Rumphius was published, providing the most detailed and accurate account of durians for over a century. The genus Durio has a complex taxonomy that has seen the subtraction and addition of many species since it was created by Rumphius. During the early stages of its taxonomical study, there was some confusion between durian and the soursop (Annona muricata), for both of these species had thorny green fruit. It is also interesting to note the Malay name for the soursop is durian Belanda, meaning Dutch durian. In the 18th century, Johann Anton Weinmann considered the durian to belong to Castaneae as its fruit was similar to the horse chestnut.|$|E
50|$|In Bulgaria, Bosnia, Montenegro, Macedonia {{and parts}} of Croatia breakfast usually {{consists}} of various kinds of savory or sweet pastry, with cheese, meat or jam filling.

Finns {{usually do not}} have sweets on their breads such as jam, or chocolate. Sour milk products such as yogurt or viili are also common breakfast foods, usually served in a bowl with cereals such as corn flakes, muesli, and sometimes with sugar, fruit or jam. Oatmeal or mixed grain porridge may also be served, usually topped <b>with</b> <b>butter.</b>|$|R

500|$|Despite being {{described}} by some mycologists as inedible or even poisonous, Lactifluus piperatus {{is generally considered}} edible. However, it is not recommended by some, because of its unpleasant taste. It is difficult to digest when eaten raw, but {{is used as a}} seasoning when dried, or sometimes is eaten fresh after parboiling, though its taste is still unappetising. Some recommend frying in <b>butter</b> <b>with</b> bacon and onion or pickling, or baking in a pie or pastry as other ways to prepare it. The milk has a very hot and acrid taste, which is removed if boiled. The mushroom used to be highly regarded in Russia, where it would be picked in dry seasons when other edible species were less available. The mushroom is also popular in Finland, where cooks boil it repeatedly, disposing of the water each time, and then store it in salt water and keep it refrigerated, after which it is pickled or served in salads. When eaten fresh and raw, the mushroom has been known to cause an irritant reaction on the lips and tongue, which subsides after an hour. The close L. glaucescens has been reported to be poisonous, but it has been speculated that the [...] "poisonings" [...] were caused by the extremely strong, peppery taste, rather than by the presence of actual poisons.|$|E

25|$|Unhomogenized {{milk and}} cream contain {{butterfat}} in microscopic globules. These globules are surrounded by membranes made of phospholipids (fatty acid emulsifiers) and proteins, which prevent the fat in milk from pooling together into a single mass. Butter is produced by agitating cream, which damages these membranes and allows the milk fats to conjoin, separating from {{the other parts of}} the cream. Variations in the production method will create <b>butters</b> <b>with</b> different consistencies, mostly due to the butterfat composition in the finished product. Butter contains fat in three separate forms: free butterfat, butterfat crystals, and undamaged fat globules. In the finished product, different proportions of these forms result in different consistencies within the butter; <b>butters</b> <b>with</b> many crystals are harder than butters dominated by free fats.|$|R

2500|$|The {{original}} plant had {{an investment}} of $3,700 in total, which was paid by 94 farmers {{in proportion to the}} number of cattle which each owned. [...] The cooperative started out making <b>butter</b> <b>with</b> the excess milk produced, and began shipping its products south. In 1930, it started making cheese. By 1960, the cooperative had 600 member farmers, though the number of farms in Vermont and across the nation were steadily shrinking.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{continental}} Europe, cultured {{butter is}} preferred, while sweet cream butter dominates in the United States and the United Kingdom. Cultured butter is sometimes labeled [...] "European-style" [...] butter in the United States, although cultured butter is made and sold by some, especially Amish, dairies. Commercial raw cream butter is virtually unheard-of in the United States. Raw cream butter is generally only found made {{at home by}} consumers who have purchased raw whole milk directly from dairy farmers, skimmed the cream themselves, and made <b>butter</b> <b>with</b> it. It is rare in Europe as well.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{strategy}} operates {{under the}} truism that [...] "opposites attract" [...] and brings together {{food and wine}} that have contrasting traits such as a crisp, acidic Sauvignon blanc and a fish with a creamy lemon sauce. The crisp acidity of the wine serves as a contrast that can cut through the creaminess of the sauce and give a different, refreshing sensation for the palate {{as opposed to what}} a complementary pairing, such as a creamy, buttery Chardonnay, would bring. For most of history, the [...] "complementary strategy" [...] was the prevailing thought on food and wine pairing. In the 1980s, as more people started to discover and experiment with pairings, the idea of using contrast started to gain more favor. It follows the same idea that the [...] "salty/sweet" [...] pairing does in cooking (such as salty peanut <b>butter</b> <b>with</b> sweet jelly).|$|E
2500|$|Nuclear {{power plants}} are a complex energy system. [...] {{and opponents of}} nuclear power have criticized the sophistication and {{complexity}} of the technology.

[...] These critics of nuclear power advocate the use of energy conservation, efficient energy use, and appropriate renewable energy technologies to create our energy future. Amory Lovins, from the Rocky Mountain Institute, has argued that centralized electricity systems with giant power plants are becoming obsolete. In their place are emerging [...] "distributed resources"—smaller, decentralized electricity supply sources (including efficiency) that are cheaper, cleaner, less risky, more flexible, and quicker to deploy. Such technologies are often called [...] "soft energy technologies" [...] and Lovins viewed their impacts as more gentle, pleasant, and manageable than hard energy technologies such as nuclear power.|$|E
