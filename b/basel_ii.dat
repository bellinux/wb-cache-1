5|$|Countries {{sought to}} improve the {{sustainability}} and transparency of the global financial system in response to crises in the 1980s and 1990s. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision was formed in 1974 by the G-10 members' central bank governors to facilitate cooperation on the supervision and regulation of banking practices. It is headquartered at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. The committee has held several rounds of deliberation known collectively as the Basel Accords. The first of these accords, known as Basel I, took place in 1988 and emphasized credit risk and the assessment of different asset classes. Basel I was motivated by concerns over whether large multinational banks were appropriately regulated, stemming from observations during the 1980s Latin American debt crisis. Following Basel I, the committee published recommendations on new capital requirements for banks, which the G-10 nations implemented four years later. In 1999, the G-10 established the Financial Stability Forum (reconstituted by the G-20 in 2009 as the Financial Stability Board) to facilitate cooperation among regulatory agencies and promote stability in the global financial system. The Forum was charged with developing and codifying twelve international standards and implementation thereof. The <b>Basel</b> <b>II</b> accord was set in 2004 and again emphasized capital requirements as a safeguard against systemic risk {{as well as the}} need for global consistency in banking regulations so as not to competitively disadvantage banks operating internationally. It was motivated by what were seen as inadequacies of the first accord such as insufficient public disclosure of banks' risk profiles and oversight by regulatory bodies. Members were slow to implement it, with major efforts by the European Union and United States taking place as late as 2007 and 2008. In 2010, the Basel Committee revised the capital requirements in a set of enhancements to <b>Basel</b> <b>II</b> known as Basel III, which centered on a leverage ratio requirement aimed at restricting excessive leveraging by banks. In addition to strengthening the ratio, Basel III modified the formulas used to weight risk and compute the capital thresholds necessary to mitigate the risks of bank holdings, concluding the capital threshold should be set at 7% of the value of a bank's risk-weighted assets.|$|E

25|$|With {{the end of}} the Bretton Woods system (1971–73) and the {{transition}} to floating exchange rates, financial stability issues came to the fore. The collapse of internationally active banks, such as Bankhaus Herstatt (1974), highlighted the need for improved banking supervision at an international level. The G10 Governors created the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS), which remains active to this day. The BIS developed into a global meeting place for regulators and for developing international standards (Basel Concordat, Basel Capital Accord, <b>Basel</b> <b>II</b> and III). Through its member central banks, the BIS was actively involved in the resolution of the Latin American debt crisis (1982).|$|E

There remain significant differences between United States, European Union, and United Nations officials regarding the degree of capital adequacy and reserve controls that global banking now requires.

500|$|Governor of the Bank of England {{and former}} Governor of the Bank of Canada Mark Carney has {{described}} two approaches to global financial reform: shielding financial institutions from cyclic economic effects by strengthening banks individually, and defending economic cycles from banks by improving systemic resiliency. Strengthening financial institutions necessitates stronger capital requirements and liquidity provisions, {{as well as}} better measurement and management of risks. The G-20 agreed to new standards presented by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision at its 2009 summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The standards included leverage ratio targets to supplement other capital adequacy requirements established by <b>Basel</b> <b>II.</b> Improving the resiliency of the global financial system requires protections that enable the system to withstand singular institutional and market failures. Carney has argued that policymakers have converged on the view that institutions must {{bear the burden of}} financial losses during future financial crises, and such occurrences should be well-defined and pre-planned. He suggested other national regulators follow Canada in establishing staged intervention procedures and require banks to commit to what he termed [...] "living wills" [...] which would detail plans for an orderly institutional failure.|$|E

40|$|As part of <b>Basel</b> <b>II’s</b> {{incremental}} risk charge (IRC) methodology, this paper summarizes our exten-sive investigations of constructing transition probability matrices (TPMs) for unsecuritized credit {{products in the}} trading book. The objective is to create monthly or quarterly TPMs with pre-defined sectors and ratings {{that are consistent with}} the bank’s Basel PDs. Constructing a TPM is not a unique process. We highlight various aspects of three types of uncertainties embedded in different construction methods: 1) the available historical data and the bank’s rating philosophy; 2) the merger of one-year Basel PD and the chosen Moody’s TPMs; and 3) deriving a monthly or quarterly TPM when the generator matrix does not exist. Given the fact that TPMs and specif-ically their PDs are the most important parameters in IRC, it is our view that banks may need to make discretionary choices regarding their methodology, with uncertainties well understood and managed. ∗All contents and opinions expressed in this document are solely those of the authors and do not represent th...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the {{interaction}} between <b>Basel</b> I, <b>II</b> and III regulations with monetary policy. In order to do that, we use a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with a housing market, banks, borrowers, and savers. Results show that monetary policy needs to be more aggressive when the capital requirement ratio (CRR) increases because the money multiplier decreases. However, this policy combination brings a more stable economic and financial system. We also analyze the optimal way to implement the countercyclical capital buffer stated by Basel III. We propose that the CRR follows a rule that responds to deviations of credit from its steady state. We find that the optimal implementation of this macroprudential rule together with monetary policy brings extra financial stability with respect to <b>Basel</b> I and <b>II...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{a critique of}} solvency regulation such as imposed on banks by <b>Basel</b> I and <b>II.</b> Banks’ investment divisions seek to maximize the expected {{rate of return on}} risk-adjusted capital (RORAC). For them, higher solvency S lowers the cost of refinancing but ties costly capital. Sequential decision making by banks is tracked over three periods. In period 1, exogenous changes in expected returns dμ and in volatility dσ occur, causing optimal adjustments dS* / dμ and dS * / dσ in period 2. In period 3, the actual adjustment dS* creates an endogenous trade-off with slope dμ / dσ. Both <b>Basel</b> I and <b>II</b> are shown to modify this slope, inducing top management to opt for a higher value of σ in several situations. Therefore, both types of solvency regulation can run counter their stated objective, which may also be true of Basel III...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{question}} the widespread belief that market discipline on banks cannot {{be effective in}} less developed financial environments. There is no systematic tendency for low-income countries to lack the prerequisites for market discipline. Offsetting factors to the weaker market and formal information infrastructures are (1) the less complex character of banking business in low-income countries; (2) the growing internationalization of these markets through the presence of foreign banks, and through international trading of the debt and equity of locally-controlled non-government banks; and (3) the smaller size of the business and financial community. However, continuing dominance by public sector banks in some countries limits the likely development of market monitoring, which is clearly a cause for concern, given the disappointing record of governments {{around the world as}} monitors of their self-owned banks. Countries should build on this potential for market discipline by limiting the role of explicit deposit guarantees, reducing state ownership of banks where it is prevalent, and not putting all their eggs in the supervisory basket. Greater disclosure, for example, of how risk taking is rewarded and how rating agencies earn their fees would support the development of better market monitoring. Enhancing market discipline (pillar three) is {{much more likely to be}} of use in most developing countries than addressing the refinements of the risk-weighting system of <b>Basel</b> <b>II's</b> first pillar.
