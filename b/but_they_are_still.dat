5|$|With {{the advent}} of deep-freeze and the {{air-conditioned}} hypermarché, these seasonal variations are less marked than hitherto, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> observed, in some cases due to legal restrictions. Crayfish, for example, have a short season and {{it is illegal to}} catch them out of season. Moreover, they do not freeze well.|$|E
5|$|North American red foxes, {{particularly}} those of northern Alaska, are the most valued for their fur, as they have guard hairs of a silky texture, which, after dressing, allow the wearer unrestricted mobility. Red foxes living in southern Alaska's coastal areas and the Aleutian Islands are an exception, as they have extremely coarse pelts that rarely exceed one-third {{of the price of}} their northern Alaskan cousins. Most European peltries have coarse-textured fur compared to North American varieties. The only exceptions are the Nordic and Far Eastern Russian peltries, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> inferior to North American peltries in terms of silkiness.|$|E
5|$|Vowel length. The {{pronunciation}} of {{long and}} short vowels depends on the syllable's position in the word. In word-initial syllables there is a phonemic contrast in length. A long vowel has about 208% {{the length of a}} short vowel. In word-medial and word-final syllables, formerly long vowels are now only 127% as long as short vowels in initial syllables, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> distinct from initial-syllable short vowels. Short vowels in noninitial syllables differ from short vowels in initial syllables by being only 71% as long and by being centralized in articulation. As they are nonphonemic, their position is determined according to phonotactic requirements.|$|E

5|$|Twelve players born {{outside the}} {{jurisdiction}} of the United States, plus two players born in U.S. insular areas (territories), have made either the first or second All-Defensive Team—Manute Bol, born in a part of Sudan that is now the independent nation of South Sudan; Hakeem Olajuwon of Nigeria; Patrick Ewing of Jamaica; Dikembe Mutombo of the Democratic Republic of the Congo; Andrei Kirilenko, born in the portion of the former Soviet Union that is now Russia; Anderson Varejão of Brazil; Thabo Sefolosha of Switzerland; Duncan and Raja Bell of the U.S. Virgin Islands; Luol Deng, a naturalized citizen of the United Kingdom born in what is now South Sudan; Serge Ibaka, born in the Republic of the Congo and naturalized in Spain; Marc Gasol, born and primarily raised in Spain; Rudy Gobert of France; and Giannis Antetokoumpo of Greece. Ewing, Olajuwon, and Kirilenko are naturalized U.S. citizens, and Duncan and Bell are U.S. citizens by birth, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> considered international players by the NBA because they were not born in one of the fifty states or Washington, D.C.|$|E

25|$|Accordionists {{in heavy}} metal make their most {{extensive}} {{appearances in the}} folk metal subgenre, and are otherwise generally rare. Full-time accordionists in folk metal seem even rarer, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> utilized for studio work, as flexible keyboardists are usually more accessible for live performances.|$|E
25|$|In India, gray langurs {{number at}} around 300,000. India has laws prohibiting the {{capturing}} or killing of langurs, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> hunted {{in some parts}} of the country. Enforcement of these laws have proven to be difficult and it seems most people are unaware of their protection. Populations are also threatened by mining, forest fires and deforestation for wood.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} of the New Zealand pigeon declined considerably after the arrival of humans in New Zealand, and this trend continues, especially in the North Island, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> relatively common in {{the west of the}} South Island and in coastal Otago.

25|$|Some of {{the groups}} (such as PES) have become {{homogeneous}} units coterminous with their Europarty, some (such as IND/DEM) have not. <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> coalitions, not parties in their own right, and do not issue manifestos of their own. It may therefore be difficult to discern how the groups intend to vote without first inspecting the party platforms of their constituent parties, and then with limited certainty.|$|E
50|$|An open {{grassland}} during the Pleistocene Ice Age, France gradually became forested as the glaciers retreated starting in 10,000 BC.

Recently, the Global Ambassadors Program became a student organization, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> affiliated with the Fort Collins International Center (FCIC).|$|E
25|$|Most of the artesanía {{produced}} in Mexico is ordinary things made for daily use, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> considered artistic because most contain decorative details and/or are painted in bright colors for aesthetic purposes. The bold use of colors in crafts and other constructions extends back into pre-Hispanic times. Pyramids, temples, murals, textiles and religious objects were painted or colored ochre red, bright green, burnt orange, various yellows and turquoise. These would {{be joined by}} other colors introduced by European and Asian contact, but always in bold tones. Even the production of colors ties {{into the history of}} craft making. Red pigment since pre-Hispanic times has made from the cochineal bug, which is crushed, dried and ground to a powder to mix into a liquid base.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, any Muslim person—including {{any person}} {{born to a}} Muslim family or any person who became a Muslim at a given point {{in his or her}} life—who {{converts}} to Christianity or re-converts to it, is considered an apostate. Apostasy, the conscious abandonment of Islam by a Muslim in word or deed, including conversion to Christianity, is punishable as a crime under applications of the Sharia (countries in the graph). There are, however, cases in which a Muslim will adopt the Christian faith, secretly without declaring his/her apostasy. As a result, they are practising Christians, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> legally Muslims, and they can face the death penalty according to the Sharia. Meriam Ibrahim, a Sudanese woman, was sentenced to death for apostasy in 2014, because the government of Sudan classified her as a Muslim, even though she was raised as a Christian.|$|E
50|$|Kabul came {{completely}} under Islamic State {{control on}} April 30, 1992, {{but the situation}} was far from stabilised.

25|$|The German Wehrmacht is {{somewhat}} {{more advanced than}} historically, with a fully mechanized supply train. The Waffen-SS units facing the Draka Citizen Airborne unit the novel centers around are also in possession of numerous 'hybrid' armoured vehicles made from German and captured Soviet parts, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> {{no match for the}} Draka army. The Draka citizen soldiers, female as well as male, are honed killing machines, each equal to several of their enemy on the battlefield. The Draka also have superb weaponry, including 14,000 Hond III tanks with armor, engine size and gun caliber approaching those of modern MBTs, and powerful air force which includes high-performance single and twin piston engine fighters, airborne early warning systems mounted on dirigibles and a twin-engine armored ground attack aircraft. By 1944, all sides are widely using nerve gas, jet- and rocket-powered fighter aircraft and ballistic missiles.|$|E
25|$|Newborn golden mice {{are fairly}} coordinated at birth; however, {{they have a}} {{tendency}} to remain quietly in one spot. By day 1, they are able to take their first steps and right themselves up easily. Their prehensile tail tendencies become evident by day 2 and by day 4 they exhibit a sense of balance and are able to balance themselves and hang upside down. By day 10, young golden mice display a tendency to crawl upward and by day 15, they are able to jump. Days 17 and 18 are when young mice are seen to become even more active, yet they remain docile when held in a hand. The first attempts at bathing have been observed at day 7 and by day 12, young golden mice attempt to wash behind their ears <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> relatively unsteady. Between days 12 to 21 newborn golden mice bathe frequently and thoroughly. By day 21, a considerable amount of time was spent outside the nest. Upon birth, if handled every few days once their eyes opened, the mice became more docile and were easily managed through their adult life. If young golden mice were not handled frequently during this period, {{they were more likely to}} be wild and difficult to manage.|$|E
