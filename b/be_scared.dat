25|$|The Scot James Tassie (1735–1799), and {{his nephew}} William (1777–1860) {{developed}} methods for taking hard impressions from old gems, {{and also for}} casting new designs from carved wax in enamel, enabling a huge production of what are really imitation engraved gems. The fullest catalogue of his impressions ("Tassie gems") was published in 1791, with 15,800 items. There are complete sets of the impressions in the Hermitage, the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, and in Edinburgh. Other types of imitation became fashionable for ladies' brooches, such as ceramic cameos by Josiah Wedgwood in jasperware. The engraved gem fell permanently out of fashion from about the 1860s, perhaps partly as a growing realization {{of the number of}} gems that were not what they seemed to <b>be</b> <b>scared</b> collectors. Among the last practitioners was James Robertson, who sensibly moved into the new art of photography. Perhaps the best known gem engraver of the 20th century, working in a contemporary idiom, is the British artist Ronald Pennell, whose work is held in the British Crafts Council Collection among many others.|$|E

500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} [...] "B–" [...] and {{concluded}} that, [...] "I did jump a few times, and I liked Haley's dour malevolence, but overall, the new Nightmare on Elm Street is a by-the-numbers bad dream that plays {{a little too much}} like a corporately ordered rerun. One, two, Freddy's coming for you. Three, four, we've been there before". Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the acting calling it [...] "lethargically lifeless" [...] and criticized Haley's portrayal of Krueger, saying, [...] "Even with his electronically deepened voice and a pointless amount of backstory, there's just no replacing Englund". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 1 star out of 4, writing in his review, [...] "I stared at A Nightmare on Elm Street with weary resignation. The movie consists of a series of teenagers who are introduced, haunted by nightmares and then slashed to death by Freddy. So what? Are we supposed to <b>be</b> <b>scared?</b> Is the sudden clanging chord supposed to evoke a fearful Pavlovian response?".|$|E
500|$|Having left Cold Feet, Ripley {{began to}} take on more leading roles; her first role was as {{housewife}} Deanna in the BBC thriller Green-Eyed Monster, which was broadcast in September 2001. She researched her character, a murderer, by visiting a coroner. Guardian critic Gareth McLean wrote of her performance, [...] "Ripley {{did a good job}} of exorcising the ghost of Jenny Gifford [...] by coolly cranking up the insane desperation and needy malevolence to an impressive degree." [...] In 2002, she played domestic abuse victim Donna Massey in Danny Brocklehurst's The Stretford Wives. Ripley was initially not eager to play another character from around Manchester so soon after leaving Cold Feet, but she changed her mind after reading the script. She did not research spousal abuse to play her character, a woman struggling to bring up her two children in a run-down house while her husband is imprisoned, because she did not find it difficult to [...] "work out what it's like to <b>be</b> <b>scared</b> and want to protect your kids". Also in 2002, Ripley played Rose Bell in the ITV post-war period drama Dead Gorgeous, alongside Helen McCrory. The following year, she provided the voice of Meg in the ITV adaptation of the Meg and Mog children's books, before playing Jill in the third series of the BBC One sitcom Bedtime at the end of 2003.|$|E
500|$|... {{is one of}} two aliens {{who come}} to Earth to aid Quiche after Quiche {{continues}} losing to the Mew Mews. Energetic and often childish, Tart taunts Quiche for losing to the Mew Mews by saying he is weak. He primarily fights using physical attacks and chimera animals, but is also capable of manipulating plants to bind people and attacking with an energy beam. Tartu shows a distinct dislike for Ichigo and refers to her as an [...] "old woman" [...] when they encounter one another, only to be called a [...] "midget" [...] in return. Midway through the series, Tart and Pie capture Bu-Ling and hold her hostage under the Tokyo Dome. While guarding her, Tart appears to be bewildered by her refusal to <b>be</b> <b>scared</b> and her attempts to befriend him. After she is freed by the others, he laughs while looking at some candy she gave him. The anime adaptation expands this incident by having Tart save Bu-Ling's life when she starts to suffocate after the cavern is sealed off. At the end of the manga Bu-Ling kisses him and he tells Bu-Ling that he might return to get another candy drop from her, and leaves for his own world. In the anime adaptation, Tart is killed by Pie when he tries to protect the Mew Mews, and revived by the final release of Mew Aqua {{at the end of the}} series.|$|E

500|$|Sandy George from Australian Screen Online {{said that}} Vidler's long {{career as an}} actor helped him [...] "draw the terrific performances" [...] from the film's young actors. 17-year-old Laurence Breuls was {{literally}} {{the first person to}} audition for the role of Jared. Hundred of others auditioned though Breuls remained the favourite choice. Vidler chose Simon Lyndon, who played the role of Jared in the original stage production of Blackrock, for the role of Ricko, stating that Lyndon had the looks, charisma, and complexity to play the role. Rebecca Smart, who also portrayed Cherie in the original stage production, was the only person to reprise their role from the play. Blackrock is often considered to be Heath Ledger's debut film, but he had an uncredited minor role in the 1991 film Clowning Around. While Ledger's role in Blackrock is small, it is credited with garnering him attention in Australia, leading to more prominent acting roles. 15-year-old Bojana Novakovic was given the role of Tracy partly because she was a competitive gymnast and was considered mentally and physically strong enough to film the rape scene. Vidler discussed the role with her parents before filming commenced, who despite initial reservations, eventually gave permission for her to film the scene. Novakovic said the experience was traumatic and she began to tremble uncontrollably once the shoot ended, though recovered shortly afterwards, concluding, [...] "In a way, I feel lucky to have had such a role at the beginning of my career. I don't think I'll ever <b>be</b> <b>scared</b> by an emotional scene again." [...] The boys involved in the scene showed up at her door the following day and gave her a bunch of flowers and a T-shirt that said [...] "shit happens". Vidler said he found the performance so powerful that when he first watched the rushes of the scene alone, he burst into tears.|$|E
500|$|Hendrix {{was not as}} {{confident}} {{a singer}} as he was a guitarist, and because he strongly disliked anyone watching him sing he asked the engineers at Olympic to construct a privacy barrier {{between him and the}} control room. This created problems when the studio lights were low, and the engineers were unable to see him, making his visual cues and prompts difficult to communicate. As was the case at De Lane Lea, Hendrix's penchant for using multiple amplifiers at extreme volume drew criticism and complaints from the people living and working near to the studio. Olympic tape operator George Chkiantz recalled: [...] "Sometimes, it got so loud we'd turn the [...] monitors off and there was really very little difference." [...] Chkiantz noted that reactions to Hendrix's music were not always positive: [...] "I seem to recall a lot of musicians, a lot of people, saying, 'I can't see what all the fuss is about myself', or 'I don't know how you listen to all that noise; I'd <b>be</b> <b>scared</b> to work with him'... Chas was convinced that he was on to something. Not everyone was convinced that Chas was right." [...] Another issue that complicated the sessions were the large number of female fans who would show up at the studio wanting to watch the Experience record. As a habit, Hendrix would indiscriminately tell people where they would be on any given day, which led to large groups of fans following him everywhere. Olympic employees were tasked with keeping them under control and at a safe distance so as to not unduly burden the recording process. Chkiantz commented: [...] "It was extraordinary. I worked with the Stones. I worked with the Beatles. I worked with Led Zeppelin. I was not as jumpy; it was not as difficult as with Hendrix. It was something of an open house. Hendrix was not difficult at all, but I personally would have preferred not to have loads of girls lurking in the woodwork." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Breakout" [...] {{was written}} by Ted Bruner, in {{collaboration}} with Trey Vittetoe and Gina Schock of the Go-Go's. It was first recorded by American pop singer Katy Perry, for her second album One of the Boys (2008), though it was never included for the album and was passed on to Cyrus, on whose version Perry sings backing vocals. Like most songs on Breakout, Cyrus wrote [...] "7 Things" [...] while traveling on the Best of Both Worlds Tour, reflecting on her numerous emotions about an ex-boyfriend. She claimed her {{use of the word}} [...] "hate" [...] demonstrated how furious she was, at the time. Originally, [...] "7 Things" [...] was more [...] "soft and nice" [...] but Cyrus says she [...] "went nuts" [...] during the recording process and gave the song a harder sound. She decided to record a cover version of Cyndi Lauper's [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" [...] from the album She's So Unusual (1983), after speaking with Lauper at the 50th Grammy Awards. The two singers were conversing about music, when Lauper stated, [...] "Well, don't <b>be</b> <b>scared</b> of anything. People waste their lives being scared. Lasso the moon. But don't do it because someone tells you it's the right idea." [...] Cyrus believed Lauper's saying encompassed the direction she wanted to take Breakout, ergo she covered [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun". However, she desired for the cover to be completely different from other covers of [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" [...] she heard. She described the process as [...] "almost [...] to relearn the song." [...] About the finished product, Cyrus said, [...] "When you listen to the song, it's, like, you're not even sure what it is. It's something completely new." [...] "Full Circle" [...] was co-written by Cyrus, Scott Cutler, and Anne Preven about Cyrus' relationship with Nick Jonas of the Jonas Brothers. [...] "It's about two people. They're always gonna come back together no matter what anyone says, the bad people that try to keep you apart", Cyrus said of the song's concept.|$|E
