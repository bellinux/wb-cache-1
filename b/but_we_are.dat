Roach and perch have already been caught and we have had no reports of any ill-effects. There is no doubt the pollution is clearing.

5|$|I don't see {{the point}} of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E
25|$|We {{full well}} know that, while the {{historic}} facts and religious truths {{of this series}} of revelatory presentations will stand on {{the records of the}} ages to come, within a few short years many of our statements regarding the physical sciences will stand in need of revision in consequence of additional scientific developments and new discoveries. These new developments we even now foresee, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> forbidden to include such humanly undiscovered facts in the revelatory records. Let it be made clear that revelations are not necessarily inspired. The cosmology of these revelations is not inspired.|$|E

25|$|The {{liability}} of West Virginia is a deepseated equity, not discharged {{by changes in}} the form of the debt, nor split up by the unilateral attempt of Virginia to apportion specific parts to the two states. If one-third of the debt were discharged in fact to all intents, we perceive no reason in what has happened why West Virginia should not contribute her proportion of the remaining two-thirds. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> of opinion that no part of the debt is extinguished, and further, that nothing has happened to bring the rule of New Hampshire v. Louisiana into play.|$|E
25|$|The Epistle to a Friend {{concerning}} Poetry {{is neither}} startling nor contemptible; it has, in fact, {{much more to}} say than the rhymed treatises on verse by Roscommon and Buckinghamshire. Its remarks on Genius are fresh, though tantalizing in their brevity, and it defends the Moderns with both neatness and energy. Much of its advice is cautious and commonplace—but such was {{the tradition of the}} poetical treatise on verse. Appearing within two years of Collier's first attack upon the stage, it reinforces some of that worthy's contentions, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not aware of its having had much effect.|$|E
25|$|On 19 April 2015 Helen Glover and Stanning won the women's pair at the British rowing trials at Caversham, {{they took}} seven minutes 36.09 seconds and {{finished}} ten seconds ahead of Jessica Eddie and Louisa Reeve, followed by Katie Greves & Zoe Lee. Glover said: We {{not only have}} great respect for each other as athletes <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> great friends on and off the water. I can genuinely say I want to win these races as much for Heather as for myself. We know how much we put into every session – it isn’t just our day job, it’s our passion.|$|E

25|$|We do {{not discuss}} the anatomical, physiological, and mental {{characteristics}} of man considered as an individual; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> interested in the diversity of these traits in groups of men found in different geographical areas and in different social classes. It is our task to inquire into the causes that have brought about the observed differentiation, and to investigate {{the sequence of events}} that have led to the establishment of the multifarious forms of human life. In other words, we are interested in the anatomical and mental characteristics of men living under the same biological, geographical, and social environment, and as determined by their past.|$|E
25|$|This LTM availability/accessibility {{dichotomy}} {{is analogous}} to a more contemporary explanation of Plato's doctrine of reminiscence, which postulates that an individual hedge {{as a result of}} information carried over from past lives. While evidence for or against immortality is outside the bounds of scientific research, one can see similarities between LTM availability/accessibility and the doctrine of reminiscence. LTM availability is highly unrestricted and practically unlimited as a storage system while LTM accessibility corresponds to what we can actually recall at any given moment. Plato, through his doctrine of reminiscence, would say that knowledge available through reminiscence is practically unrestricted <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not cognizant of many of those ideas because they have yet to be recalled.|$|E
25|$|In September 2011, {{shortly after}} China and Vietnam had signed an {{agreement}} seeking to contain a dispute over the South China Sea, India's state-run explorer, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) said that its overseas investment arm ONGC Videsh Limited had signed a three-year deal with PetroVietnam for developing long-term cooperation in the oil sector {{and that it had}} accepted Vietnam's offer of exploration in certain specified blocks in the South China Sea. In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Jiang Yu issued a protest. The spokesman of the Ministry of External Affairs of the Government of India responded by saying that “The Chinese had concerns <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going by what the Vietnamese authorities have told us and have conveyed this to the Chinese.” The Indo-Vietnamese deal was also denounced by the Chinese state-run newspaper Global Times.|$|E

25|$|In the Short Parliament {{that started}} on 13 April 1640, Hampden stood forth amongst the leaders. He guided the House {{in the debate}} on 4 May in its {{opposition}} to the grant of twelve subsidies {{in return for the}} surrender of ship money. Parliament was dissolved the next day, and on 6 May an unsuccessful search was made among the papers of Hampden and of other chiefs of the party to discover incriminating correspondence with the Scots. During the eventful months which followed, when Strafford was striving in vain to force England, in spite of its visible reluctance, to support the king in his Scottish war, rumour has much to tell of Hampden's activity in rousing opposition. It is likely enough that the rumour is in the main true, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not possessed of any satisfactory evidence on the subject.|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the embassy}} cannot be doubted. The {{distinguished}} ambassadors visited the Hun's camp near the south shore of Lake Garda. It is also certain that Attila suddenly retreated. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{at a loss to}} know what considerations were offered him to induce him to depart. It is unreasonable to suppose that this heathen king would have cared for the thunders or persuasions of the Church. The Emperor refused to surrender Honoria, and it is not recorded that money was paid. A trustworthy chronicle hands down another account which does not conflict with the fact that an embassy was sent, but evidently furnishes the true reasons which moved Attila to receive it favourably. Plague broke out in the barbarian host and their food ran short, {{and at the same time}} troops arrived from the east, sent by Marcian to the aid of Italy. If his host was suffering from pestilence, and if troops arrived from the east, we can understand that Attila was forced to withdraw. But whatever terms were arranged, he did not pretend that they meant a permanent peace. The question of Honoria was left unsettled, and he threatened that he would come again and do worse things in Italy unless she were given up with the due portion of the Imperial possessions.|$|E

So, it's really hard to fix, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> working on it. And we continue to work on it.
