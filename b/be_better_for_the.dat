5|$|Attorneys {{have long}} used {{peremptory}} challenges to exclude undesirable prospective jurors, {{but have not}} always been successful. Much of the early efforts were based on lawyers' folklore about who makes a good juror for their case. Early examples of scientific jury selection were similar. For example, in the 1975 Joan Little trial, defense attorneys used an astrologer to help choose the jury. More rigorous methodology was on display during the first major use of SJS, the 1972 Harrisburg Seven trial. During that trial, social scientists used demographic characteristics to identify biases in favor of conviction. The consultants in the case had conducted surveys that indicated women and Democrats would make defense-friendly jurors, and the religious, those with college degrees, and Reader's Digest subscribers would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> prosecution. Although surveys had indicated that 80% of citizens in conservative Harrisburg, Pennsylvania would convict the defendants, they were acquitted of all serious charges.|$|E
5|$|U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps {{set a new}} Olympic {{record of}} 50.58 to defend his title in the event, edging out Serbia's Milorad Čavić (50.59) by one {{hundredth}} of a second (0.01). He also earned his seventh Olympic gold at a single Games, tying Mark Spitz's 1972 record for the most gold medals. Australia's Andrew Lauterstein earned a bronze in 51.12, finishing in a close race against world record holder Ian Crocker by the slimmest margin. Phelps' triumph occurred after Čavić had remarked that it would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sport if Phelps was defeated. Phelps' margin of triumph was so close that the Serbian team filed a protest, but after officials reviewed the video, the International Swimming Federation (FINA) announced that Phelps did touch the wall first and his victory would be upheld.|$|E

25|$|However, {{only one}} of these Nash equilibria {{satisfies}} a more restrictive equilibrium concept, subgame perfection. Suppose that the first demands a large amount that gives the second some (small) amount of money. By rejecting the demand, the second is choosing nothing rather than something. So, it would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second to choose to accept any demand that gives him/her any amount whatsoever.

25|$|An opinion {{had long}} been gaining ground that it would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{community}} {{and the interests of}} learning, {{as well as for the}} university, if the power to elect the overseers were transferred from the legislature to the graduates of the college. This change was made in 1865, and at the same time the governor and other state officers ceased to form part of the board. The effect of this change was to greatly strengthen the interest of the alumni in the management of the university, and thus to prepare the way for extensive and thorough reforms. Shortly afterward Dr. Thomas Hill resigned the presidency, and after a considerable interregnum Eliot succeeded to that office in 1869.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between the HDP and the PKK has been put forward by the governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) as a reason why it would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> HDP to not gain representation in Parliament, though government journalists alleged that this would result in greater violence by the PKK and attempts to establish a separate parliament in Diyarbakır. In election posters and propaganda, the HDP {{has been accused of}} scaremongering and using the PKK to coerce voters into voting for them, stating that there would be more violence if the HDP failed to pass the election threshold. In contrast, HDP politicians also accused the AKP of scaremongering when they claimed that their affiliation to the PKK made them unfit for parliamentary representation. PKK militants have also been accused of raiding local shops and cafes in the south-east of Turkey and demanding votes for the HDP, with one civilian being wounded when a group of PKK youth militants raided a cafe in Silvan. Selahattin Demirtaş has denied having an 'organic relationship' with the PKK and claimed that the allegations of PKK militants demanding votes for the HDP from voters was untrue.|$|E

25|$|At {{this time}} {{engineering}} officers, {{who had become}} increasingly important in the fleet as it became steadily more dependent upon machinery, were still largely looked down upon by command officers. Fisher considered it would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> navy if the two branches could be merged, as had {{been done in the}} past with navigation officers who had similarly once been a completely separate speciality. His solution was to merge the cadet training of ordinary and engineer officers and revise the curriculum so that it provided a suitable grounding to later go on to either path. The proposal was initially resisted by the remainder of the Board of Admiralty, but Fisher convinced them of the benefits of the changes. Objections within the navy as a whole were harder to quell and a campaign once again broke out in newspapers. Fisher was thoroughly aware of the benefits of getting the press on his side and continued to leak information to friendly journalists. Beresford was approached by officers objecting to the changes to act as champion of their cause, but sided with Fisher on this issue.|$|E
25|$|In a story arc {{stretching}} {{through several}} of the Eighth Doctor Adventures, sometime in the Doctor's future, a war is fought between the Time Lords and an unnamed Enemy, the Eighth Doctor becoming involved in {{the events of the}} war during the events of Alien Bodies, when he unintentionally becomes involved in an auction for the body of his future self due to his biodata codes being the only means of accessing dangerous Time Lord secrets, and The Taking of Planet 5, where he must stop a group of future Time Lords from releasing the monstrous Fendahl in an attempt {{to use it as a}} weapon. In this story arc, Gallifrey is also destroyed as a result of the Eighth Doctor attempting to prevent the war from beginning as the Enemy begin their first assault in, having learned that he unintentionally provoked the War, believing that it would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Time Lords to die now rather than experience a war that would dehumanise them to the point of becoming monsters which all evidence suggests they could not win. This cataclysm also creates an event horizon in time that prevents anyone from entering Gallifrey's relative past or travelling from it to the present or future. The last Eighth Doctor Adventures novel, The Gallifrey Chronicles, establishes that the Doctor has the ability to restore the planet and its inhabitants, having downloaded the contents of the Matrix into his subconscious mind in the minutes before Gallifrey's destruction, albeit at the cost of his own memories. The novel ends without revealing if he does indeed do this.|$|E

Lord Nelson wrote the following March that he hoped that Gibraltar [...] "will escape the dreadful scourge of last autumn, and I hope that General Fox has burnt down all the small houses at the back of the Town; and perhaps if half the Town went with them, it would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Rock." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{the script}} for Strange Days was {{completed}} in 1993, the lead characters were not secured in the cast list until May 1994. Originally, actor Andy Garcia was a potential candidate to star in the film, and Bono of the Irish rock band U2 was rumored to star as Faith's love interest Philo Gant. Ultimately, Academy Award nominees Ralph Fiennes, Angela Bassett, and Juliette Lewis were chosen as the leads. Fiennes' role in the Schindler's List impressed Bigelow enough to want to cast him as Nero, stating that the role [...] "required somebody who had {{a tremendous amount of}} intelligence, complexity, depth, a series of qualities that I really felt only Ralph could supply." [...] Cameron, however, felt that a [...] "glibber and slicker" [...] actor would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> role, but admitted that Fiennes made Lenny [...] "a sexier character—a guy you can care about very much." [...] In contrast, Bassett was already suggested by Cameron since the beginning. The fact that Lewis was able to sing was appreciated as the producers wanted to avoid lip-synching.|$|E
500|$|Jonathon Young {{returns as}} half-vampire Nikola Tesla. In the tenth episode, the {{character}} was [...] "de-vamped". Kindler felt this development was a bold choice, but also believed his vampirism {{was the least}} interesting character trait against being a genius and having electricity-based powers. The producers wanted to make Tesla somewhat heroic by sacrificing that part of him. Like the first season, there were instances where Young was unavailable to shoot some of his scenes due to theatre commitments, so he {{was replaced by a}} body double. Christine Chatelain returns as Will's girlfriend Clara Griffin. Clara was killed off in the second episode; Tapping viewed the death as an [...] "important casualty" [...] that has resonance to the main characters. Robert Lawrenson made a recurring appearance as Declan McRae, the head of the London Sanctuary following the death of James Watson in the season one finale. The character was originally going to be introduced in [...] "Hero", but Kindler decided it would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> character to be introduced earlier in the season.|$|E
500|$|Compared with Vitalogy and No Code, Yield {{represented}} {{more of a}} {{team effort}} between {{all members of the}} group. Lead vocalist Eddie Vedder had made the final decisions for the albums Vitalogy and No Code; however, {{at the end of the}} No Code recording sessions, Vedder suggested to bassist Jeff Ament that it would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> other members to write and bring in more complete songs so Vedder would be under less pressure to finish the songs. Ament said that [...] "everybody took that to heart," [...] and O'Brien added that most of the songs came to the studio finished. Ament also said that Vedder's reaction to the rest of the band's new material kept [...] "everybody energized about their place in the band." [...] Vedder worked with the other band members on their own material before work was started on his. Guitarist Mike McCready noticed a change in Vedder's attitude during the recording of Yield, stating, [...] "I used to be afraid of him and not want to confront him on things ...

500|$|Among the Brazilian land barons were David Canabarro and Antônio de Sousa Neto, both {{allies of}} Flores and former separatist rebels during the Ragamuffin War that had ravaged Rio Grande do Sul from 1835 until 1845. Canabarro, a {{frontier}} military commander, misled Brazil's government by denying that Brazilians were {{crossing the border}} to join Flores. Sousa Neto went to the Brazilian capital to request immediate government intervention in Uruguay, claiming that Brazilians were being murdered and their ranches robbed. The [...] "fact that Uruguayan citizens had just as valid claims against Brazil as Brazilians had against Uruguay was ignored", said historian Philip Raine. Although Sousa Neto had ties with the governing political party, his claims, including that he could amass a force of 40,000 to invade Uruguay, were not taken seriously by all. The Uruguayan crisis arrived at a difficult moment for Brazil, which {{was on the verge}} of a full-blown war with the British Empire for unrelated reasons. Brazil's government decided to intervene in Uruguay, fearful of showing any weakness in the face of an impending conflict with Britain, and believing that it would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> central government to take the lead rather than allow the Brazilian ranchers on the frontier to decide the course of events.|$|E

Mullally informed her agent {{that she did not}} want to do any more sitcoms or auditions for sitcoms, during the time that Will & Grace came around.

[...] She initially auditioned for the role of Grace, but admitted that {{she did not want to}} audition for the part of Karen.

She also said, [...] "...I think it was just a feeling that I had that it would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> pace of the show and it would be funnier in some way, but I didn't know why. Karen has a lot of joy, even when she's in a bad mood.
