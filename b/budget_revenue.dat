40|$|Although {{studies on}} {{entrepreneurship}} are conducted outside the main trend of economics, {{it is generally}} believed that entrepreneurial activity is a factor fostering economic development.

This is the main aim of the paper. The research has shown that <b>budget</b> <b>revenues</b> have a stronger influence on entrepreneurship than budget expenditures. While entrepreneurs negatively react to <b>budget</b> <b>revenues</b> from indirect taxes and corporate income tax, an increase in <b>budget</b> <b>revenues</b> from personal income tax has a positive influence on entrepreneurship. At the same time budget expenditures on national insurance and investments negatively shape the rate of proper entrepreneurs. The rate of quasi-entrepreneurs, however, is negatively influenced by budget expenditures on national insurance influence, but positively by the budget expenditures on investments. The results of the analysis allow us to recommend a policy of reducing fiscal charges, and direct taxes and corporate income tax in particular, as a tool of stimulating entrepreneurial activity...|$|R
