25|$|The {{unpainted}} stainless body creates challenges during {{restoration of}} the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original ("straight") as possible and imperfections are sculpted back to form with <b>body</b> <b>filler</b> like Bondo or lead (body solder). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the quarter panel). With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain—which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to work-harden. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired; each DeLorean service center today {{has at least one}} experienced body repair person on staff, and there are decades worth of new stainless panels still available in most instances.|$|E

40|$|O doping no mundo esportivo e na subcultura de atletas profissionais e recreacionais de culturismo já é muito conhecido e estudado pela comunidade acadêmica e científica. Porém, uma nova problemática, que definimos como doping cosmético, inseriu-se há algumas décadas no mundo todo, e tem crescido em importância no Brasil nos últimos anos. Trata-se de injeções sistemáticas de substâncias oleosas por via intramuscular, conhecidas como ADE (vitaminas lipossolúveis A, D e E), com intuito de aumentar volumetricamente o músculo per se, podendo levar a necroses, deformidades físicas ou até mesmo ao óbito. Apresentamos a história do uso cosmético dos preenchedores corporais e revisamos os possíveis efeitos deletérios e fatais que podem resultar do seu abuso, assim como os mecanismos envolvidos na evolução clínica da aplicação destas substâncias. Além disto, apresentamos métodos simples para observação potencial do uso. Pretendemos com este trabalho convocar a classe dos profissionais de saúde para que esta publique relatos de casos quando estes usuários forem atendidos devidos às complicações de tal uso, visto que os casos que até hoje apareceram são apenas o início de uma nova problemática de saúde pública que tende a aumentar consideravelmente. Doping {{in sports}} {{world and in}} the {{subculture}} of professional and recreational bodybuilding athletes is very much known and also studied by the academic and scientific community. However, a new problem, which we defined as cosmetic doping, was introduced some decades ago and has grown in importance in Brazil in recent years. It is the systematic injection of oily substances by intramuscular routes, known as ADE (liposoluble vitamins A, D and E), with the purpose to enlarge the muscle volumetrically, what could lead to necrosis, physical deformities or even death. This article introduces {{the history of the}} cosmetic use of <b>body</b> <b>fillers</b> and the review of the possible deleterious and lethal effects that could result {{as a consequence of the}} use, as well as the mechanisms that are involved after the injection of these substances. Moreover, simple methods for potential observation of its use in athletes are presented.

30|$|The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the USA {{considers}} injectable facial fillers {{as medical}} devices {{used to improve}} appearance and without health benefit [34]. The classifications of injectable facial fillers vary according to their properties such as nature of the filler, time interval for its biodegradation, and whether it is composed {{of one or more}} materials [35, 36]. The filler can be autologous, biological, or synthetic. Autologous fillers consist of the patient’s own <b>body</b> fat. Biological <b>fillers</b> consist of either collagen of bovine, porcine, or human origin or hyaluronic acid (HA) of bacterial origin. Synthetic fillers include paraffin, silicone, calcium hydroxyapatite (CHA), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) microspheres, polyacrylamide hydrogel, hydroxyethyl/ethyl methacrylate, and poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) [36]. Based on biodegradation features, fillers can be classified as rapidly resorbable (< 12  months), slowly resorbable (< 24  months), and permanent. Rapidly resorbable fillers include HA, collagen and autologous fat. Slowly resorbable fillers include PLLA, CHA and dextran, whereas permanent fillers include liquid silicone and PMMA [36]. Silicone is the most widely used non-resorbable synthetic substance for medical purposes. Of the three forms of silicone, only the liquid silicone is used as facial filler while the elastomer and gel are used in breast implants [37, 38]. The FDA and the European Community (EC) do not recommend all commercially available products. While some products may be FDA approved, they are not EC approved and vice-versa [39, 40]. Besides, some products have a limited approval, which limits their use to the specified areas in the face.|$|R
50|$|Body filler: <b>Body</b> <b>filler</b> (or Bondo) is {{a two-part}} putty {{often used to}} fix dents in automobiles. Case modders use it to fill and sculpt their own creations. When mixed with a paste {{catalyst}} the filler hardens {{in a short period}} of time and can be sanded, ground or cut to a desired shape. An alternative system uses fiberglass resin (catalyzed with liquid hardener) and either fiberglass cloth or mat to fill holes and form shapes. Lacquer based Spot Putty is often used to fill smaller imperfections before the application of primer. Typically, a case modder uses a combination of these materials to obtain the desired result. This method is usually used on the front plastic bezel of a computer case to give it a new look.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most common}} PDR {{techniques}} utilize metal rods and body picks to push out the dents from {{the underside of}} the body panel. Glue and specially designed tabs may be used to pull out the dents from the outside of the panel. Fine tuning the repair often involves tapping down the repair to remove small high spots. Quality technicians can blend high spots to match the texture of the paint called orange peel. Pushing too hard can create high spots that cause the clear coat to split or crack. Experienced technicians can avoid cracking or chipping with the use of heat, although a re-painted surface most likely will crack.

Methods: Female subjects with self-evaluated flaccidity scores ≥ 3 on a 6 -point scale (0, no flaccidity; 5, very severe flaccidity) in the zones of interest were included. Radiesse was injected according to predesigned vector maps (3 mL per thigh, 1. 5 mL per hemiabdomen or brachial zone). Clinical assessments (skin density and thickness) were made by an independent reviewer at an exact position before and 5 weeks after treatment using a cutometer and an ultrascan. Subjects rated skin flaccidity before and 5 weeks after treatment on the 6 -point scale and performed a pinch test to self-assess changes in skin thickness. All adverse events were recorded. Results: Twenty females (aged 28 – 67 years) were enrolled, contributing 36 treatment zones. Across all zones, 78 % of flaccidity measurements improved after treatment. Improvements in skin flaccidity were most common in the thighs (82 % of cases). An improvement in skin density versus baseline was observed in the majority across all zones, most frequently in the abdomen (88 % of cases). Skin thickness in each zone also improved versus baseline for the majority, most frequently in the thighs (88 % of cases). Mean self-assessed flaccidity scores at baseline were 3. 6 (thighs), 3. 7 (abdomen), and 3. 8 (brachial zone), and 2. 6, 2. 7, and 3. 0, respectively, posttreatment. All subjects reported a positive pinch test. In total, 47. 0 % of subjects had bruising after treatment, which resolved within a week. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Using this novel technique, Radiesse had notable results on skin flaccidity, density and thickness in the thighs, abdomen, and brachial zones, and was well tolerated.

50|$|Before the 1940s, body solder {{was often}} used to repair large {{imperfections}} prior to painting. Solder repairs were conducted using a flame and wooden paddles covered in tallow or motor oil, which prevented the half-molten lead from sticking. After the war, automotive panels became thinner and larger, with a greater susceptibility to warping. The earliest 'plastic solder' {{can be traced to}} around 1940, a do-it-yourself solution to panel beating. This gave the consumer the ability to attempt reasonably priced and long lasting repairs. These early fillers were epoxy-based and one part, drying by out gassing. The most notable early filler was called Black Magic (<b>body</b> <b>filler),</b> and was popular before Bondo's introduction. Bondo, a two-part (resin with hardener added) mix of talc and plastic, was introduced in 1955. It was developed by World War II veteran and automotive repair shop owner Robert Merton Spink of Miami, Florida.|$|E
50|$|A {{quarter panel}} (British English: rear wing) {{is the body}} panel (exterior surface) of an {{automobile}} between a rear door (or only door on each side for two-door models) and the trunk (boot) and typically wraps around the wheel well. The similar front section between {{the door and the}} hood (bonnet), is called a fender, but is sometimes incorrectly also referred to as a quarter panel. Quarter panels are typically made of sheet metal, but are sometimes made of fiberglass, carbon fiber, or fiber-reinforced plastic. A quarter panel is typically a welded-on component of the unibody structure. Replacement of a sheet metal quarter panel typically requires it to be cut off the vehicle and a replacement part to be welded (or sometimes bonded) to the vehicle. Due to the high amount of specialized labor, a quarter panel may often be repaired rather than replaced by hammering the damaged area to a relatively flat surface and then applying a <b>body</b> <b>filler</b> to smooth out the damaged area to match the original surface. The panel is then usually painted and often clear coated.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAutologous fat {{transfer}} is a century-old method for both aesthetic and reconstructive purposes. It {{is considered by}} many plastic surgeons the ideal <b>body</b> <b>filler.</b> The only disadvantage is its variable degree of resorption, which ranged from 45 % to 80 %. Various groups have studied the effects of cryo-preservation for fat storage, the advantage being that fat harvesting need only be performed once, and thereafter fat injections can be performed using stored fat as an outpatient service. This a clinical study carried out to test the aesthetic outcome of serial injection of the cryo-preserved fat cells for both aesthetic and reconstructive purposes. MethodsClinical evaluation was performed under standardized condition for serial lipofilling between October 2003 and May 2012, and 364 autologous fat transfers were performed in 104 patients ranging in age from 18 to 69 years (mean age 34 years). ResultsThe postoperative clinical results favored the use of serial fat transfer because the aesthetic and structural results were stable up to 90 % of the initial volume {{more than a year after}} initial transfer. ConclusionOur data suggest that serial transfer of the cryo-preserved fat leads to better cosmetic results on the basis of outpatient service without increasing the financial burden for our patients...|$|E

The maintenance shops repair and maintain vehicles and equipment used {{in support of the}} Hanford cleanup mission. There are three general mechanic shops and one auto body repair shop. The mechanics work on heavy equipment used in construction, cranes, commercial motor vehicles, passenger-type vehicles in addition to air compressors, generators, and farm equipment. Services include part fabrication, installation of equipment, repair and maintenance work in the engine compartment, and tire and brake services. Work performed at the auto body shop includes painting and surface preparation which involves applying <b>body</b> <b>filler</b> and sanding. 8 -hour time-weighted-average samples were collected for benzene and noise exposure and task-based samples were collected for lead dust work activities involving painted metal surfaces. Benzene samples were obtained using 3 M™ 3520 sampling badges and were analyzed for additional volatile organic compounds. These compounds were selected based on material safety data sheet information for the aerosol products used by the mechanics for each day of sampling. The compounds included acetone, ethyl ether, toluene, xylene, VM&P naphtha, methyl ethyl ketone, and trichloroethylene. Laboratory data for benzene, VM&P naphtha, methyl ethyl ketone and trichloroethylene were all below the reporting detection limit. Airborne concentrations for acetone, ethyl ether, toluene and xylene were all less than 10 % of their occupational exposure limit. The task-based samples obtained for lead dusts were submitted for a metal scan analysis to identify other metals that might be present. Laboratory results for lead dusts were all below the reporting detection limit and airborne concentration for the other metals observed in the samples were less than 10 % of the occupational exposure limit. Noise dosimetry sampling was performed on a random basis and was representative of the different work activities within the four shops. Twenty three percent of the noise samples exceeded the occupational exposure limit of 85 decibels for an 8 -hour time-weightedaverage.
