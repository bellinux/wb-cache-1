5|$|Abnormal genitalia: usually {{cryptorchidism}} (retention of testicles in body) or monorchism (single testicle). In female patients, this presents {{as missing}} or single ovaries, much harder <b>by</b> <b>nature</b> to detect. Ultrasound imaging is performed at regular intervals, {{from the age}} of 1 year, to determine if ovaries are present.|$|E
5|$|The first, original, {{and truly}} natural {{boundaries}} of states are beyond doubt their internal boundaries. Those who {{speak the same}} language are joined to each other by a multitude of invisible bonds <b>by</b> <b>nature</b> herself, long before any human art begins; they understand each other and have the power of continuing to make themselves understood more and more clearly; they belong together and are <b>by</b> <b>nature</b> one and an inseparable whole.|$|E

5|$|Although rather solitary and introspective <b>by</b> <b>nature,</b> Elgar {{thrived in}} Worcester's musical circles.

Elgar regularly played the bassoon in a wind quintet, alongside his brother Frank, an oboist (and conductor who ran his own wind band). Elgar arranged numerous pieces by Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and others for the quintet, honing his arranging and compositional skills.|$|E

The song was a mild success on the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks, peaking at 51 and 27 on the charts recectively, but it became Naughty <b>by</b> <b>Nature's</b> fourth top 10 single on the Hot Rap Singles, peaking at 5 on that chart.

5|$|Gopalam and {{his wife}} Ammi, jovial <b>by</b> <b>nature,</b> treat the couple like their own children. Although Mary finds the Hindu customs strange, she says nothing to Gopalam and Ammi because she needs her job to repay David. She vents her {{frustration}} to Rao and Devaiah, who bear it patiently. Although Sita wanted Mary to teach her music, Mary's short temper diminishes her confidence and Rao takes over her music lessons.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} specimen {{is notable}} for containing an embryo in its abdominal region, of which cervical vertebrae, forelimbs, {{and several other}} elements are preserved. It was collected in 2008; {{by the time of}} its collection, weathering had already split the specimen into three blocks, with the gaps having been filled by modern soil. The specimen was then transferred to the Chengdu Center of the China Geological Survey, where it was prepared and stored under the collection number LPV 30280. Subsequently, a description of the specimen, authored by Jun Liu, Chris Organ, Michael Benton, Matthew Brandley, and Jonathan Aitchison, was published in February 2017 <b>by</b> <b>Nature</b> Communications.|$|E
5|$|Philippine {{music has}} evolved rapidly {{due to the}} {{different}} influences stemming from colonialism under other countries. Before the Spanish conquest of the islands, most music was reminiscent of, or heavily influenced <b>by,</b> <b>nature.</b> Some examples of this tribal music is Koyu No Tebulul of the T'boli and Ambo Hato of the Ifugao. This genre is often accompanied by gong music and one well known instrument is the Kulintang.|$|E

5|$|Some {{processes}} {{convert a}} meat or dairy product into a pareve (neither meat nor dairy) one. For example, rennet is sometimes made from stomach linings, yet is acceptable for making kosher cheese, but such cheeses {{might not be}} acceptable to some vegetarians, who would eat only cheese made from a vegetarian rennet. The same applies to kosher gelatin, an animal product, derived from kosher animal sources. Other gelatin-like products from non-animal sources such as agar agar and carrageenan are pareve <b>by</b> <b>nature.</b> Fish gelatin is derived from fish and is therefore (like all kosher fish products) pareve. Eggs are also considered pareve despite being an animal product.|$|E
5|$|The {{black mamba}} is graceful but skittish and often unpredictable. It is agile and can move quickly, it is shy and secretive <b>by</b> <b>nature</b> and, like most snakes, it avoids threats. In the wild, a black mamba seldom tolerates humans {{approaching}} {{more closely than}} about 40 meters. When confronted {{it is likely to}} gape in a threat display, exposing its black mouth and flicking its tongue. It also is likely to form a hood by spreading its neck-flap as cobras do. The mamba's hood however, is narrower than that of a typical cobra. The threat display may be accompanied by audible hissing.|$|E
5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} is diurnal (active mainly during the day), though it mainly rests or ruminates in dense undergrowth at noon. Though solitary <b>by</b> <b>nature,</b> the {{four-horned antelope}} may form loose {{groups of three}} to five. Groups consist {{of one or more}} adults, sometimes accompanied by juveniles. Males and females hardly interact, except in the mating season.|$|E

5|$|The {{practice}} of coon hunting is sometimes associated with possum hunting, since the same dogs were often used, {{the animals are}} both climbers <b>by</b> <b>nature,</b> and are common in the same geographic areas. However, opossums are criticized for being too easy to hunt and too greasy to be edible if killed, and are seldom hunted today.|$|E
5|$|After Argentina's {{unsuccessful}} {{performance in}} the Copa América, Batista was replaced by Alejandro Sabella. Upon his appointment in August 2011, Sabella awarded the 24-year-old Messi the captaincy of the squad, in accord with then-captain Javier Mascherano. Reserved <b>by</b> <b>nature,</b> Messi went on to lead his squad by example as their best player, while Mascherano continued to fulfil {{the role of the}} team's on-field leader and motivator. In a further redesign of the team, Sabella dismissed Tevez and brought in players with whom Messi had won the World Youth Championship and Olympic Games. Now playing in a free role in an improving team, Messi finally ended his goal drought by scoring during their first World Cup qualifying match against Chile on 7 October, his first official goal for Argentina in two-and-a-half years.|$|E
5|$|As the Messi {{family had}} {{relatives}} in Catalonia, {{they sought to}} arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but {{the board of directors}} hesitated; {{at the time it was}} highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin. In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved <b>by</b> <b>nature,</b> he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the century, Gaudí was working on numerous projects simultaneously. They reflected his shift to a more personal style inspired <b>by</b> <b>nature.</b> In 1900, he received an award for the best building of the year from the Barcelona City Council for his Casa Calvet. During {{the first decade of the}} century Gaudí dedicated himself to projects like the Casa Figueras (Figueras house, better known as Bellesguard), the Park Güell, an unsuccessful urbanisation project, and the restoration of the Cathedral of Palma de Mallorca, for which he visited Majorca several times. Between 1904 and 1910 he constructed the Casa Batlló (Batlló house) and the Casa Milà (Milá house), two of his most emblematic works.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{new road}} proved far more {{difficult}} than first imagined. Workers followed an old Native American trail, wholly consumed <b>by</b> <b>nature,</b> between Delhi and Port Talbot. To get across the numerous swamps, felled trees were laid across the path to create a corduroy road, much {{to the chagrin of}} settlers. The outbreak of the War of 1812 would temporarily halt further construction. When it resumed in 1816, Talbot himself began directing the surveyor, ordering that the road remain on the highest ground possible. This led to an irregular and winding route between Aylmer and Delhi. By 1830, the corduroy logs had been removed and the road improved and extended from Amherstburg to Canborough.|$|E
5|$|Despite Turtle’s shortcomings, Bushnell’s {{invention}} marked {{an important}} milestone in submarine technology. The American inventor Robert Fulton conceived of his submarine Nautilus {{in the first}} years of the nineteenth century and took it to Europe when the United States proved largely uninterested in the design. During the American Civil War, the Confederate States of America, faced with a similar situation to that of the colonies during the War of Independence, developed an operational submarine CSS H.L. Hunley, whose destruction of the USS Housatonic in Charleston Harbor in February 1864 was the first successful submarine attack in history. By the early-twentieth century, the world’s navies were beginning to adopt submarines in larger numbers. Like Bushnell’s design, these boats mimicked the natural forms of marine animals the in their hull designs. As one contemporary historian of submarines observed in 1901, the evolution of modern submarine evolved from the whale, which he deemed a “submarine made <b>by</b> <b>nature</b> out of a mammal.|$|E
