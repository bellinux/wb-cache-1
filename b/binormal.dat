25|$|Given a curve {{contained}} on the x-y plane, its {{tangent vector}} T is also contained on that plane. Its <b>binormal</b> vector B can be naturally postulated {{to coincide with}} the normal to the plane (along the z axis). Finally, the curve normal can be found completing the right-handed system, N = B × T. This form is well-defined even when the curvature is zero; for example, the normal to a straight line on a plane will be perpendicular to the tangent, all co-planar.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there is}} no axis of symmetry, there are two optical axes or <b>binormals</b> which are defined as {{directions}} along which light may propagate without birefringence, i.e., directions along which the wavelength is independent of polarization. For this reason, birefringent materials with three distinct refractive indices are called biaxial. Additionally, there are two distinct axes known as optical ray axes or biradials along which the group velocity of the light is independent of polarization.|$|R
40|$|The subgrid-scale {{representation}} of hydrometeor fields {{is important for}} calculating microphysical process rates. In order to represent subgrid-scale variability, the Cloud Layers Unified By <b>Binormals</b> (CLUBB) parameterization uses a multivariate probability density function (PDF). In addition to vertical velocity, temperature, and moisture fields, the PDF includes hydrometeor fields. Previously, hydrometeor fields were assumed to follow a multivariate single lognormal distribution. Now, {{in order to better}} represent the distribution of hydrometeors, two new multivariate PDFs are formulated and introduced. The new PDFs represent hydrometeors using either a delta-lognormal or a delta-double-lognormal shape. The two new PDF distributions, plus the previous single lognormal shape, are compared to histograms of data taken from large-eddy simulations (LESs) of a precipitating cumulus case, a drizzling stratocumulus case, and a deep convective case. Finally, the warm microphysical process rates produced by the different hydrometeor PDFs are compared to the same process rates produced by the LES...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the coupling of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) version 5 with a unified multi-variate probability density function (PDF) parameterization, Cloud Layers Unified by <b>Binormals</b> (CLUBB). CLUBB replaces the {{planetary boundary layer}} (PBL), shallow convection, and cloud macrophysics schemes in CAM 5 with a higher-order turbulence closure based on an assumed PDF. Comparisons of single-column versions of CAM 5 and CAM-CLUBB are provided in this paper for several boundary layer regimes. As compared to Large Eddy Simulations (LES), CAM-CLUBB and CAM 5 simulate marine stratocumulus regimes with similar accuracy. For shallow convective regimes, CAM-CLUBB improves the representation of cloud cover and liquid water path (LWP). In addition, for shallow convection CAM-CLUBB offers better fidelity for sub-grid scale vertical velocity, which is an important input for aerosol activation. Finally, CAM-CLUBB results are more robust to changes in vertical and temporal resolution when compared to CAM 5...|$|R

In the second part of this dissertation the ruled surfaces of normals and <b>binormals</b> of a regular space curve are locally classified under the left-right action according to the types of the curve.

40|$|The Griffiths {{formalism}} {{is applied}} to find constant torsion curves which are extremal for arclength with respect to variations preserving torsion, fixing the endpoints and the <b>binormals</b> at the endpoints. The critical curves are elastic rods of constant torsion, which are shown to not realize certain boundary conditions. In the calculus of variations under nonholonomic constraints, one tries to find the least energy solution among candidates satisfying a given differential equation. The subject {{has its roots in}} the investigations of such classical problems as the Delauney problem [5], where one tries to minimize length among curves in R 3 of fixed constant curvature. It has broad applications in optimal control theory, especially in the use of the Pontrjagin maximum principle [10]. In recent years, the subject has come to the attention of geometers again, with the investigations of sub-Riemannian geometry [11], but also with the arrival of a beautiful reformulation of the criticalit [...] ...|$|R

2500|$|Concretely, {{suppose that}} the {{observer}} carries an (inertial) top (or gyroscope) with her along the curve. [...] If the axis of the top points along the tangent to the curve, {{then it will be}} observed to rotate about its axis with angular velocity -τ relative to the observer's non-inertial coordinate system. [...] If, on the other hand, the axis of the top points in the <b>binormal</b> direction, then it is observed to rotate with angular velocity -κ. [...] This is easily visualized in the case when the curvature is a positive constant and the torsion vanishes. [...] The observer is then in uniform circular motion. [...] If the top points {{in the direction of the}} <b>binormal,</b> then by conservation of angular momentum it must rotate in the opposite direction of the circular motion. [...] In the limiting case when the curvature vanishes, the observer's normal precesses about the tangent vector, and similarly the top will rotate in the opposite direction of this precession.|$|E

[...] More specifically, the formulas describe the derivatives of the so-called tangent, normal, and <b>binormal</b> unit vectors in terms of each other. [...] The formulas are named after the two French mathematicians who [...] independently discovered them: Jean Frédéric Frenet, in his thesis of 1847, and Joseph Alfred Serret in 1851.

2500|$|Spinors form a vector space, usually {{over the}} complex numbers, {{equipped}} with a linear group representation of the spin group that does not factor through {{a representation of the}} group of rotations (see diagram). [...] The spin group is the group of rotations keeping track of the homotopy class. Spinors are needed to encode basic information about the topology of the group of rotations because that group is not simply connected, but the simply connected spin group is its double cover. [...] So for every rotation there are two elements of the spin group that represent it. [...] Geometric vectors and other tensors cannot feel the difference between these two elements, but they produce opposite signs when they affect any spinor under the representation. [...] Thinking of the elements of the spin group as homotopy classes of one-parameter families of rotations, each rotation is represented by two distinct homotopy classes of paths to the identity. [...] If a one-parameter family of rotations is visualized as a ribbon in space, with the arc length parameter of that ribbon being the parameter (its tangent, normal, <b>binormal</b> frame actually gives the rotation), then these two distinct homotopy classes are visualized in the two states of the belt trick puzzle (above). [...] The space of spinors is an auxiliary vector space that can be constructed explicitly in coordinates, but ultimately only exists up to isomorphism in that there is no [...] "natural" [...] construction of them that does not rely on arbitrary choices such as coordinate systems. [...] A notion of spinors can be associated, as such an auxiliary mathematical object, with any vector space {{equipped with a}} quadratic form such as Euclidean space with its standard dot product, or Minkowski space with its Lorentz metric. [...] In the latter case, the [...] "rotations" [...] include the Lorentz boosts, but otherwise the theory is substantially similar.|$|E
