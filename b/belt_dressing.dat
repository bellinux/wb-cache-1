50|$|Majos {{and their}} girlfriend majas were representatives of fringe urban lumpenproletariat {{originating}} from Spanish provinces, {{and played a}} catalytic role in the public debate and turned their lower status into a way to express their freedom and rejection of afrancesado ('Frenchified', high society and traditional society of that time in general). Both maja men and women wore daggers at their <b>belts,</b> <b>dressed</b> provocatively and foppishly, deliberately behaved themselves arrogantly, were notable for freedom of manners, and sometimes lived on banditry and looting.|$|R
50|$|Women's dress {{consisted}} of fitted garments worn underneath a <b>belted</b> <b>dress</b> {{which was also}} called giornea. Unlike the men's version, the women's reached the ground and covered their feet. Women's giorneas, originally evolved from the houppelande, had separate skirts and bodices. The skirts were tight at the waist and {{the lower part of}} the dress was often pleated. They were cut at the front, and in later years at the sides, to display the rich undergarments. Underneath the giornea women wore a dress called gamurra, which was a high-waisted long dress which could have detachable sleeves. The underdress worn underneath this was a simple linen dress called camicia.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "Great Mother", Cybele, as the Greeks and Romans knew her, was {{originally}} worshiped {{in the mountains}} of Phrygia, where she was known as [...] "Mountain Mother". In her typical Phrygian form, she wears a long <b>belted</b> <b>dress,</b> a polos (a high cylindrical headdress), and a veil covering the whole body. The later version of Cybele was established by a pupil of Phidias, the sculptor Agoracritus, and became the image most widely adopted by Cybele's expanding following, both in the Aegean world and at Rome. It shows her humanized though still enthroned, her hand resting on an attendant lion and the other holding the tympanon, a circular frame drum, similar to a tambourine.|$|R
50|$|Pop punk fashion, {{sometimes}} {{overlaps with}} skater punk fashion. Originally this consisted of black or tartan baggy pants (sometimes fitted with studs and eyelets), band hoodies, wristbands, patrol caps, pyramid stud <b>belts,</b> <b>dress</b> shirts with thin ties or scarves, blazers and spiky hair or fauxhawks. In the mid-2000s, pop punk fashion, influenced by indie rock, hip hop and emo fashions, evolved to include cartoon print hoodies, Converse shoes, keffiyehs and skinny jeans. Spiky hair was gradually replaced by skater styles with long fringes or bangs. In the 2010s, pop punk fans {{took on a}} more hardcore look, with shorter hair (including Liberty spikes and a wide Mohawk combined with a fringe), plain hoodies and straight-leg jeans.|$|R

50|$|The attackers were {{described}} as African, armed with Kalashnikov rifles and grenade <b>belts</b> and <b>dressed</b> in casual clothes and balaclavas. A shootout occurred between the attackers and police forces as the assailants reached La Paillote Hotel. Local residents and tourists were evacuated by army personnel from the beach to nearby hotels, which were temporarily placed on lockdown.|$|R

25|$|The {{ceremonial}} dress of the Military Police Corps is a IDF regular uniform, {{with a white}} peaked cap, a brassard with the letters Mem and Tzadik on the left arm, and a white <b>belt.</b> This <b>dress</b> is also worn on duty, mostly by MPs performing discipline patrols in public places (train and bus stations, entrances to large bases, etc.) In the past, a white helmet with the letters Mem and Tzadik was used {{in place of the}} peaked cap.|$|R
5000|$|The dress, like Hepburn's later {{little black}} dress in Breakfast at Tiffany's, is cited {{as one of the}} classic dresses of the 20th century. A poll by Debenhams, {{published}} in the Daily Telegraph, voted it the second most iconic red carpet dress of all time. Time magazine voted the dress the greatest Oscar dress of all time. After the Oscar awards, an editorial review of the stylish white <b>belted</b> Givenchy <b>dress</b> worn by Hepburn gave it the title [...] "It's a Cinch".|$|R

50|$|An {{addition}} to the Rocket Man back-pack and helmet, used {{for the first time}} in this serial, is a two-way radio about the size of a lunchbox; Larry Martin wears it hanging heavily from his <b>belt</b> when <b>dressed</b> for flying. This radio is also seen in some stills of Cody in Commando Cody: Sky Marshal of the Universe. As most flying sequences are reused stock footage from earlier Rocket Man serials, the radio usually disappears when Commando Cody is in flight. Martin also uses an ordinary police revolver instead of the ray gun favored by Cody in earlier and later serials.|$|R

2500|$|In the {{north-east}} {{corner of}} the north transept are brass plaques to William Turnor, died 1473, and his two wives Margery and Margaret. A brick tomb is also to William Turnor with the [...] "figures of man in fur-edged gown, with belt and bag, and of two women in <b>belted</b> <b>dresses</b> and veiled head-dresses, with inscription and two inscribed scrolls, indents of two shields and figures of children."

5000|$|At his peak output, O'Donnell {{presided over}} more than 200 {{separate}} movie theaters scattered across the Midwest. Quoting directly from the source, in 1941 he was called by the Hollywood producers that were making movies “the # 1 exhibitor in the United States”. [...] The producers on Broadway spoke of him as an [...] "outside sizzler" [...] and remember {{him as one of}} the Bright <b>Belt’s</b> best <b>dressed</b> theater men. [...] Organized charities across the United States called him a [...] "port in any storm". [...] And every employee of the Interstate Circuit called him simply [...] "The Boss with a heart of Irish gold".|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to cups, rhinoceros horn was also sometimes {{used to make}} other objects, such as medicine / snuff bottles, hair pins, <b>belt</b> hooks, and <b>dress</b> toggles. Due to high demand for rhinoceros horn medicine, rhinoceros horn carvings were ground down for medicine. Whilst the popularity of libation cups has aided their survival, it appears far fewer of these other examples have survived.|$|R
