25|$|Winfrey claims her worst {{interviewing}} {{experience was}} with Elizabeth Taylor in the show's second season. Just <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview,</b> Taylor asked Winfrey {{not to ask}} any questions about her relationships. Winfrey found {{this to be a}} challenge considering Taylor had been married seven times. Taylor returned to the show in 1992, apologized to Winfrey and told her that she was in excruciating back and hip pain at the time.|$|E

The Interview ended when Liddell asked the host who {{he would like to}} fight. UFC President Dana White, along with Liddell's head coach Scott VanGilder, explained that Liddell had pneumonia and had taken a large dose of sedatives the night <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview.</b>|$|E

He {{was the first of the}} eight banned players to die, and is buried at Woodlawn Memorial Park in Greenville. Prior to his death, he was {{scheduled}} to be interviewed on television to set the record straight about reports that he was living in poverty, but died <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview</b> could take place.

25|$|A {{few days}} later, Dirk Münch, Münch's son, {{publicly}} expressed {{his lack of}} comprehension of this interview. He explained {{that his father had}} been suffering from poor concentration for two years. He criticised the fact that Schindler's List had been watched directly <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview,</b> saying that this would have been very exhausting due to the film's three-hour length and his father's advanced age. Dirk Münch stated that, after the film, his father had even confused the female house cat Minka with the male cat Peter. A German filmmaker who made a documentary about Münch also stated that he was non compos mentis. He was later diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
25|$|Gale is {{notorious for}} her attacks on celebrities, but Charlie's agent, Jason, insists the {{interview}} will keep her on-side. <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview</b> begins, Gale explores the folly, going through one doorway and {{emerging from the}} other, back where she started, thanks to an optical illusion that fools one into thinking one is ascending to a higher level. Jason sits in, attempting to control the interview, both he and Gale with tape recorders; but Gale steers the conversation around to how Charlie became famous. In reality, he first grabbed attention as an inept, injured sportsman being carried away from a Marathon, applauded by the crowd. Appearing on a game show he gained public sympathy by getting all the questions wrong. But invited back he eventually became celebrity host of the show. Charlie is happy to be considered useless at everything, but Gale suggests he is failing on purpose.|$|E
500|$|Several {{observers}} {{have noted that}} foreign journalists {{were not allowed to}} interview the self-immolation victims recovering in hospitals. Even the victims' relatives were not permitted to speak with them, according to David Ownby. [...] Pan wrote that [...] "Beijing denied requests to interview Liu Siying and the three other survivors, who are all hospitalized... A Kaifeng official said only China Central Television and the official New China News Agency were permitted to speak to their relatives or their colleagues. A man who answered the door at the Liu home referred questions to the government." [...] The survivors were interviewed by the state-run press, however. In one such interview, CCTV interviewed the 12-year-old Liu Siying. Government sources reported Liu Siying had undergone a tracheotomy shortly <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview.</b> Speaking through approved media outlets, she said that her own mother told her to set herself on fire to reach the [...] "heavenly golden kingdom"; journalist Danny Schechter doubted that the child {{would have been able to}} speak to the Chinese media so soon after a tracheotomy, yet Liu Siying appeared to be speaking clearly and singing in the interview.|$|E

2500|$|During his driving career, Moss {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{recognised}} celebrities in Britain, leading to many media appearances. In March 1958, Moss was a guest challenger on the TV panel show What's My Line? (episode with Anita Ekberg). In 1959 he was the subject of the TV programme This Is Your Life. On June 12 the following year he was interviewed by John Freeman on Face to Face; Freeman later said that he had thought <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview</b> that Moss was a playboy, but in their meeting he showed [...] "cold, precise, clinical judgement... a man who could live so close to the edge of death and danger, and trust entirely to his own judgement. This appealed to me". Moss also appeared as himself in the 1964 film The Beauty Jungle, and was one of several celebrities with cameo appearances in the 1967 version of the James Bond film Casino Royale. He played Evelyn Tremble's (Peter Sellers) driver.|$|E

60|$|At length--as {{common sense}} {{will get the}} better in all cases when a man will but give it fair play--I began to stand convicted in my own mind, as an ass <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview,</b> for having {{expected}} too much--an ass during the interview, for having failed to extract the lady's real purpose--and an especial ass, {{now that it was}} over, for thinking so much about it. But I can think of nothing else, and therefore I am determined to think of this to some good purpose.|$|E

Both the Letter of Information and the Letter of Consent contained details about their right to withdraw, and the letters were distributed <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviews.</b> Also, pseudonyms were given to protect each participant’s identity in writing up the findings.|$|R

But as they sat together through the twilight and {{into the darkness of}} night, close by the open window, through which the heavily laden air of the metropolis came to them, hot with all the heat of a London July day, very many words were spoken by the Countess.

40|$|Objective: Substance misuse is a {{major public}} health threat in Iran. The total number of addicts in Iran is {{estimated}} to be between 700, 000 and 4, 000, 000. A few limited household studies on the prevalence of substance misuse have been performed in Iran. Method: The residents of the sixth district of the municipality of Tehran who were over the age of 15 were selected as the study population. The sample size was 2, 705. The instrument of the study was face-to-face interviews. Results: 184 (6. 8 %) of the subjects had used at least one substance in their lives and 142 (5. 2 %) used a substance during <b>the</b> month <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviews.</b> 132 (4. 88 %), 10 (0. 37 %), 3 (0. 11 %), 5 (0. 19 %) and 4 (15 %) of the subjects reported the use of alcohol, opium, opium residue, heroin, and cannabis respectively during <b>the</b> month <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviews.</b> Conclusion: <b>The</b> estimate and profile of substance use are different from other methodologies. This household study indicated lower than expected prevalence of opioids and higher than expected alcohol use. Indirect estimation methods are probably more appropriate for the prevalence studies of substance misuse in Iran. Key words...|$|R

60|$|That {{crisis was}} to involve more than Annaple {{in the least}} expected. Nuttie found that the momentous {{confession}} could not possibly take place <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview</b> with Mr. Bulfinch, at which her presence was needed to help her father with his papers. The principal concern was to show the full enormity of the bailiff, and decide upon the steps to be taken, the solicitor being anxious for a prosecution, while a certain tenderness for poor Gregorio's memory, or perhaps for the exposure of his own carelessness, made Mr. Egremont reluctant. There was also a proposal, brought forward with much diffidence from Mr. Condamine's mother, to rent Bridgefield House, but on this, as well as respecting a successor to the bailiff, Mr. Egremont was to give his answer the next day, when Mr. Bulfinch would call again.|$|E
60|$|Evelyn rose, and, {{making some}} excuse, left the room. A {{suspicion}} which had troubled {{her more than}} Gerald's conduct had lately crept into her mind, and it now thrust itself upon her attention--several things pointed {{to the fact that}} her father had taken a similar course to that which her brother had taken. She felt that had she heard Mabel's information <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview</b> with Vane, she might have yielded to him in an agony of humiliation. Mabel had summed up the situation with stinging candour and crudity--Vane, who had been defrauded, was entitled to recover the money he had parted with. For a few moments Evelyn was furiously angry with him, and then, growing calmer, she recognised that this was unreasonable. She could not imagine any idea of a compact originating with the man, and he had quietly acquiesced in her decision.|$|E
60|$|As for Mrs. Cliff, her {{delight in}} the thought of meeting Captain Horn, great as it was, was overshadowed by her almost frantic desire to clasp once more in her arms her dear friend Edna. The clergymen had heard {{everything}} that the Summer Shelter people could tell them about Captain Horn and his exploits, and each man of them was anxious {{to look into the}} face and shake the hand of the brave sailor, whom they had learned to look upon as a hero; and one or two of them thought that it might be proper, under the circumstances, to resume their clerical attire <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview.</b> But this proposition, when mentioned, was discountenanced. They were here as sailors to work the yacht, and they ought not to be ashamed to look like sailors. The yacht was now put about and got under headway, and slowly moved {{in the direction of the}} approaching steamer.|$|E
40|$|Abstract   The aim of {{the present}} study was, {{on the basis of the}} {{positive}} psychology perspective, to examine factors that have an impact on individuals' perceived resilience, and to create an understanding of the recovery at various adversities, changes and disruptions in life. Six interviews were made and the data were analyzed by using the ad hoc method. <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviews</b> were accomplished, a measurement of the personal resilience of the six individuals was made by using the Swedish version of the Wagnild and Youngs resilience scale. The results of the individual resilience scale tests showed differences in the resilience score. <b>The</b> <b>interviews</b> showed that positive emotions such as freedom, love and happiness were experienced in the context of adversity and change, and that social support was important in the recovery process...|$|R
30|$|It is {{important}} to mention that ethical issues were considered {{in the design of}} the study. The proposal for the study was evaluated and approved by the Senate Postgraduate Studies Committee of the Department of Development Studies at Sokoine University of Agriculture, chaired by Dr. Emmanuel T.

This was followed by issuing a research clearance letter by the Vice Chancellor, by then Prof. Gerald Monela, that was submitted to the local leaders in the study area after which an agreement was made to conduct the study. An oral informed consent from all the respondents was sought <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviews.</b> Participation in <b>the</b> study was voluntary, and therefore, respondents were free to participate or not.|$|R
