25|$|Revox went {{one step}} further: after much {{hesitation}} {{about whether to}} accept cassettes as a medium capable for meeting their strict standards from reel-to-reel recorders at all, they produced their B710MK I (Dolby B) and MK II (Dolby B) machines. Both cassette units possessed double capstan drives, but with two independent, electronically controlled capstan motors and two separate reel motors. The head assembly moved by actuating a damped solenoid movement, eliminating all <b>belt</b> <b>drives</b> and other wearable parts. These machines rivaled the Nakamichi in frequency and dynamic range. The B710MKII also achieved 20–20,000Hz and dynamics of over 72dB with Dolby C on chrome and slightly less dynamic range, but greater headroom with metal tapes and Dolby C. Revox adjusted the frequency range on delivery with many years of use in mind: when new, the frequency curve went upwards a few dB at 15–20kHz, aiming for flat response after 15 years of use, and headwear to match.|$|E

40|$|For {{making a}} generic model of planar <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> systems in Dymola, {{the project is}} divided in two steps; First, the Planar Multibody Library (PML), which is built of general {{components}} for use in two-dimensional applications such as mass, revolute joint and beam element. Second, modelling of the Scania <b>Belt</b> <b>Drive</b> Library (SBDL) by using the components in the first step and making some new components specially designed for <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> simulations. Results of the Scania <b>Belt</b> <b>Drive</b> Library are validated against the experimental data and AVL/Timing Drive. Advantages such as the possibility of changing or updating the components equations, start up simulation, being less error prone due to user inputs, and even simulation performance are the major reasons for which the Scania <b>Belt</b> <b>Drive</b> Library has been created. Modelling of a component in Dymola demands deriving the necessary equations of motion for that special component...|$|R

2500|$|Pierre Michaux's son Ernest is {{credited}} by L. J. K. Setright and David Burgess-Wise as having first fitted the Perreaux patented engine to the velocipede, while Charles M. Falco {{says it was}} Louis-Guillaume Perreaux. The Michaux-Perreaux machine was constructed using the first commercially successful pedal bicycle, a boneshaker which Michaux had been building over 400 of annually since 1863, and the single cylinder alcohol fueled Perreaux engine, which used twin flexible leather <b>belt</b> <b>drives</b> to the rear wheel. A steam pressure gauge was mounted in the rider's view above the front wheel, and steam to the cylinder was engaged and regulated with a hand control. The base Michaux velocipede came with a spoon brake but the steam version had no brakes. The engine weighed , and the total weight of the steam velocipede was [...] A 14 June 1871 addition to Perreaux's patent included {{the removal of the}} cranks and pedals from the front wheel, and using an arched instead of straight downtube to allow space for the engine. Although the steam velocipede was functional, it did not have any commercial successors.|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{reliability}} assessment and reliability-based optimal design of <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> {{are based on}} the stress–strength interference model. However, the stress–strength interference model is essentially a static model, and the sensitivity analysis of <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> reliability with respect to design parameters needs further investigations. In this article, time-dependent factors that contribute the dynamic characteristics of reliability are pointed out. Moreover, dynamic reliability models and failure rate models of <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> systems under the failure mode of slipping are developed. Furthermore, dynamic sensitivity models of <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> reliability based on the proposed dynamic reliability models are proposed. In addition, numerical examples are given to illustrate the proposed models and analyze the influences of design parameters on dynamic characteristics of reliability, failure rate, and sensitivity functions. The results show that the statistical properties of design parameters have different influences on reliability and failure rate of <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> in cases of different values of design parameters and different operational durations...|$|R

And based on the PDJ- 4 <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> experiment facility giving examples of analysis, we draw the conclusion that with the increase of tension, rotary motion error increases at the same time. Thus it will have a greater rotary motion error when the tension is too large. This paper proposed the scheme and measures to improve that error eventually...|$|R
