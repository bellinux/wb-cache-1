Both are 0, being sums {{in which}} both the {{positive}} and negative of a 0-simplex occur once. The <b>boundary</b> <b>of</b> a <b>boundary</b> is always 0. A nontrivial cycle is something that closes up like the <b>boundary</b> <b>of</b> a simplex, in that its boundary sums to 0, but which isn't actually the <b>boundary</b> <b>of</b> a simplex or chain. Because trivial 1-cycles are equivalent to 0 in , the 1-cycle at right-middle is homologous to its sum with the <b>boundary</b> <b>of</b> the 2-simplex at left.|$|R
