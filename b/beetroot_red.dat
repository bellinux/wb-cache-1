25|$|The {{most heavily}} studied betalain is betanin, also called <b>beetroot</b> <b>red</b> {{after the fact}} that it may be {{extracted}} from red beet roots. Betanin is a glucoside, and hydrolyzes into the sugar glucose and betanidin. It is used as a food coloring agent, and the color is sensitive to pH. Other betalains known to occur in beets are isobetanin, probetanin, and neobetanin. The color and antioxidant capacity of betanin and indicaxanthin (betaxanthin derived of L-proline) are affected by dielectric microwave heating. Addition of TFE (2,2,2-trifluoroethanol) is reported to improve the hydrolytic stability of some betalains in aqueous solution. Furthermore, a betanin-europium(III) complex has been used to detect calcium dipicolinate in bacterial spores, including Bacillus anthracis and B. cereus.|$|E

50|$|Betanin, or <b>Beetroot</b> <b>Red,</b> {{is a red}} glycosidic food dye {{obtained}} from beets; its aglycone, obtained by hydrolyzing away the glucose molecule, is betanidin. As a food additive, its E number is E162. Betanin degrades when subjected to light, heat, and oxygen; therefore, it is used in frozen products, products with short shelf life, or products sold in dry state. Betanin can survive pasteurization when in products with high sugar content. Its sensitivity to oxygen is highest in products with a high water content and/or containing metal cations (e.g. iron and copper); antioxidants like ascorbic acid and sequestrants can slow this process down, together with suitable packaging. In dry form betanin is stable {{in the presence of}} oxygen.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine if}} the oral consumption of <b>red</b> <b>beetroot</b> food color would result in an inhibition of N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA) -induced tumors in the rat esophagus. Rats were treated with NMBA and given either regular water ad libitum or water containing 78 [*]μg/mL commercial <b>red</b> <b>beetroot</b> dye, E 162. The number of NMBA-induced esophageal papillomas was reduced by 45 % (P[*]<[*]. 001) in animals that received the food color compared to controls. The treatment also resulted in reduced rates of cell proliferation in both precancerous esophageal lesions and in papillomas of NMBA-treated rats, as measured by immunohistochemical staining of Ki- 67 in esophageal tissue specimens. The effects of beetroot food color on angiogenesis (microvessel density by CD 34 immunostaining), inflammation (by CD 45 immunostaining), and apoptosis (by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling staining) in esophageal tissue specimens were also determined. Compared to rats treated with NMBA only, the levels of angiogenesis and inflammation in the beetroot color-consuming animals were reduced, and the apoptotic rate was increased. Thus, the mechanism(s) of chemoprevention by the active constituents of <b>red</b> <b>beetroot</b> color include reducing cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and inflammation and stimulating apoptosis. Importantly, consumption of the dye in the drinking water for a period of 35 weeks did not appear to induce any overt toxicity. Based on the fact that <b>red</b> <b>beetroot</b> color contains betanins, which have strong antioxidant activity, it is postulated that these effects are mediated through inhibition of oxygen radical-induced signal transduction.

40|$|International audienceCoupled to {{increasing}} consumer demand, food manufacturers have moved towards increased usage of approved natural colours. There {{is a legal}} requirement for governments to monitor the consumption of all food additives in the EU to ensure the ADIs are not exceeded, especially by young children. Validated analytical methods are needed to fulfil this requirement. The aim {{of this paper is}} to review the available literature on methods of extraction for approved natural colours in food and drink. Available analytical methods for the determination of EU-permitted natural food colour additives in foods and beverages have been critically assessed for their fitness for purpose in terms of their the key extraction and analysis procedures, selectivity (range) and sensitivity, especially with regard to maximum permitted levels, and their applicability for use in surveillance and in an enforcement role. The advantages and disadvantages of available analytical methods for each of nine designated chemical classes (groups) of natural colours in different food and beverage matrices are given. Other important factors such as technical requirements, cost, transferability and applicability are given due consideration. Gaps in the knowledge and levels of validation are identified and recommendations made on further research to develop suitable methods. The nine designated natural colour classes covered are: 1. Curcumin (E 100), 2. Riboflavins (E 101 i-ii), 3. Cochineal (E 120), 4. Chlorophylls - including chlorophyllins and copper analogues (E 140 - 141), 5. Caramel Classes I - IV (E 150 a-d), 6.

40|$|The {{glutathione}} of the <b>red</b> <b>beetroot</b> vacuoles (Beta vulgaris L.) {{was measured}} using three well-known methods: the spectrofluorimetric method with orthophthalic aldehyde (OPT); the spectrophotometric method with 5. 5 '-dithiobis- 2 -nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB); the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The content of reduced (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) differed depending on the research method. With OPT the concentration of glutathione was: GSH – 0. 059 µmol /mg protein; GSSG – 0. 019 µmol/mg protein and total glutathione (GSHtotal) – 0. 097 µmol/mg protein. In the case of determining with DTNB the concentration of glutathione was: GSH – 0. 091 µmol/mg protein; GSSG – 0. 031 µmol/mg protein; GSHtotal – 0. 153 µmol/mg protein. HPLC-defined concentration of glutathione was lower: GSH – 0. 039 µmol/mg protein; GSSG – 0. 007 µmol/mg protein; GSHtotal – 0. 053 µmol/mg protein.

This study evaluated consumer acceptance, purchase intent and intention of product replacement of bread enriched with <b>red</b> <b>beetroot,</b> carrot with coriander, red pepper with tomato or white beetroot (80 g vegetable per serving of 200 g) compared to white control bread (0 g vegetable). Consumers (n= 120) rated their liking of the breads overall, {{as well as their}} liking of appearance, flavour and texture using nine-point hedonic scales. Product replacement and purchase intent of the breads was rated using five-point scales. The effect of providing consumers with health information about the breads was also evaluated. There were significant differences in overall liking (P< 0. 0001), as well as liking of appearance (P< 0. 0001), flavour (P= 0. 0002) and texture (P= 0. 04), between the breads.

Betanin inhibited the ONOO- (0. 5 mM) -dependent nitration of tyrosine (0. 1 mM). Additionally, the IC 50 value of betanin (19. 2 μM) was lower than that of ascorbate (79. 6 μM). The presence of betanin (0. 05 - 1. 0 μM) also inhibited ONOO- (0. 5 mM) -dependent DNA strand cleavage in a concentration-dependent manner.

40|$|The green beet (Beta vulgaris var. cicla L.) and <b>red</b> <b>beetroot</b> (B. vulgaris var. rubra L.) contain phytochemicals {{that have}} {{beneficial}} effects on human health.

These phytochemicals show considerable antioxidant activity, as well as antiinflammatory and antiproliferative activities. Vitexin- 2 -O-xyloside, in combination with betaxanthins and betacyanins, exerts antiproliferative activity in breast, liver, colon and bladder cancer cell lines, through the induction of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. A significant body of evidence also points to the role of these phytochemicals in the downregulation of the pro-survival genes, baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat-containing 5 and catenin beta- 1, as well as the genes controlling angiogenesis, hypoxia inducible factor 1 A and vascular endothelial growth factor A. The multi-target action of these phytochemicals enhances their anticancer activity. Vitexin- 2 -O-xyloside, betaxanthins and betacyanins can be used in combination with conventional anticancer drugs to reduce their toxicity and overcome the multidrug resistance of cancer cells.
