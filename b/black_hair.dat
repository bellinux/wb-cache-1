5|$|Professor Severus Snape, {{who has a}} hooked nose, sallow {{complexion}} and greasy <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> teaches Potions, {{but would}} prefer to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts. Snape praises pupils in Slytherin, his own House but seizes every opportunity to humiliate others, especially Harry. Several incidents, beginning with the shooting pain in Harry's scar during the start-of-term feast, lead Harry and his friends to think Snape is a follower of Voldemort.|$|E
5|$|Since Callimachus' poem, Coma Berenices {{has been}} {{occasionally}} mentioned outside astronomy. In 1886, Spanish artist Luis Ricardo Falero created a mezzotint print personifying Coma Berenices alongside Virgo and Leo. In 1892, the Russian poet Afanasy Fet made the constellation {{the subject of}} his short poem, composed for the Countess Natalya Sollogub. Francisco Guerrero, a 20th century composer from Spain, wrote an orchestral work on the constellation in 1996. In 1999 Irish artist Alice Maher made a series of four oversize drawings, entitled Coma Berenices, of entwining <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> coils.|$|E

During the trip the Indians killed and scalped Martin's child, which they found burdensome. Martin responded by screaming in grief; when the Indians' threats to scalp her did not quiet her screams, they whipped her until she was silent. Alder's life was spared due to his appearance. His captors thought his <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> would allow him to pass as an Indian.|$|E

In Crisis Core, Zack has two attires; his Final Fantasy VII outfit and a different outfit worn during the start of the game, which he changes after fighting Angeal Hewley. Zack's full name was first revealed in an article in Dengeki PlayStation. Nomura stated that Zack's name was derived from 'fair weather' and specifically chosen because it contrasted with Cloud Strife's name.|$|E
5|$|Anggun's {{image has}} been {{compared}} to that of Pocahontas. At the early stage of her career as a rock singer, Anggun was known for her tomboy look—wearing a crooked beret, shorts, studded jacket, and large belt; this set a trend during the early 1990s. Later, she has focused on femininity and sexuality, emphasising her long <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> and brown skin. For this look she utilises the work of fashion designers like Azzedine Alaïa, Dolce & Gabbana, and Roberto Cavalli. In 2001, Anggun was dubbed as the sixth Sexiest Women of Asia by FHM magazine. Later in 2010, she was ranked at number 18 on the French version of FHMs list of 100 Sexiest Women in the World.|$|E
5|$|Bleach {{was first}} {{conceived}} from Tite Kubo's desire {{to draw a}} shinigami in a kimono, which {{formed the basis for}} the design of the Soul Reapers. Because of this, Kuchiki {{was one of the first}} characters of the series to be created. Before deciding that every Soul Reaper had swords, Kubo thought that they all should use guns, while only Rukia used a scythe. However, this was changed as he created the Soul Reaper kimono. Kubo also mentioned that Rukia did not seem like a lead character, so he created Ichigo Kurosaki to be the series protagonist. Ichigo's initial design had <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> like Rukia; Kubo had to modify Ichigo's appearance to contrast with hers, giving Ichigo orange hair and a trademark scowl.|$|E

5|$|On August 8, 2011, Rick Riordan {{released}} a video giving {{more information about}} the book and its characters. The video includes pictures of a black haired boy with a bow and arrow in his hands who is later revealed to be Frank Zhang, a blonde-haired boy holding a teddy bear later revealed as Octavian, a girl with <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> wearing gold armor and a purple cloak sitting on a throne flanked by a gold and a silver canine creature, both with red eyes, who was revealed on Rick Riordan's blog to be Reyna, and another girl riding a horse named Hazel Levesque. Along with this, two chapters were released prior to the book's launch: one was put on Riordan's website and another read out by Riordan on Percy's birthday, August 18.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans are {{the most}} {{arboreal}} of the great apes and {{spend most of their}} time in trees. Their hair is reddish-brown, instead of the brown or <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> typical of chimpanzees and gorillas. Males and females differ in size and appearance. Dominant adult males have distinctive cheek pads and produce long calls that attract females and intimidate rivals. Younger males do not have these characteristics and resemble adult females. Orangutans {{are the most}} solitary of the great apes, with social bonds occurring primarily between mothers and their dependent offspring, who stay together for the first two years. Fruit is the most important component of an orangutan's diet; however, the apes will also eat vegetation, bark, honey, insects and even bird eggs. They can live over 30years in both the wild and captivity.|$|E
5|$|Ibuki's build is {{depicted}} as slim and athletic, with <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> held tightly back in a topknot ponytail that drops well beneath her waist. Her usual fighting outfit, in which she has appeared {{in most of the}} games, is a type of ninja dogi, consisting of a sleeveless upper garment, baggy pants (slit at the sides), arm guards, and a mask that conceals the lower half of her face. Her footwear consists only of cloth bandages wrapped around her shins, ankles and instep. Ibuki's alternative, everyday costume is a blue-and-white Japanese schoolgirl uniform, or casual clothes—in the same color scheme—with a chain of miniature kunai knives and a fake tanuki tail, introduced in Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition. One of her scrapped costume concepts for Super Street Fighter IV was a very distinct, partially armored ninja outfit, which was more skimpy and featured two Japanese swords on her back.|$|E
50|$|Red and Lemon colours {{are caused}} by the e allele of MC1R. The e allele is recessive, so red and lemon dogs are {{homozygous}} e/e.

5|$|Munch (Richard Belzer) is {{reluctant}} {{to follow up on}} the case of murdered drug addict Jenny Goode, who was run over by a car. The case has been cold for three months, but he is made to feel guilty by his partner Bolander (Ned Beatty) into reexamining it. Munch makes no progress after speaking with the family and reexamining notes. Based on witness accounts of a man with long blond hair and a black car, Munch spends all night looking through suspect photos until he finds a man with a black car with front end damage and long <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> but blond eyebrows. Munch and Bolander question him, believing the suspect (Joe Hansard) to have dyed his hair to change his appearance after killing the woman. He quickly confesses to having hit her accidentally while driving drunk.|$|E
5|$|The Malaysian Penanggalan is a {{woman who}} {{obtained}} her beauty through the active use of black magic or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women. Malaysians hung jeruju (thistles) around the doors and windows of houses, hoping the Penanggalan would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns. The Leyak is a similar being from Balinese folklore of Indonesia. A Kuntilanak or Matianak in Indonesia, or Pontianak or Langsuir in Malaysia, {{is a woman}} who died during childbirth and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as an attractive woman with long <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> that covered a hole {{in the back of her}} neck, with which she sucked the blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off. Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads, eggs under each armpit, and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming langsuir. This description would also fit the Sundel Bolongs.|$|E
