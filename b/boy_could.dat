5|$|When the war ended, {{it was not}} {{expected}} that the inefficient Little Boy design would ever again be required, and many plans and diagrams were destroyed. However, by mid-1946 the Hanford Site reactors were suffering badly from the Wigner effect. Faced {{with the prospect of}} no more plutonium for new cores and no more polonium for the initiators for the cores that had already been produced, Groves ordered that a number of Little Boys be prepared as an interim measure until a cure could be found. No Little Boy assemblies were available, and no comprehensive set of diagrams of the Little <b>Boy</b> <b>could</b> be found, although there were drawings of the various components, and stocks of spare parts.|$|E
5|$|According to cricket {{historian}} Bernard Whimpress, {{the early}} signs of a conspiracy against Marsh were raised by a journalist from The Age of Melbourne {{by the name of}} Old Boy. The journalist set a possible agenda by raising a question about Marsh to Crockett on the day before the bowler was called, possibly predisposing the umpire to take action. If Old <b>Boy</b> <b>could</b> be relied on, then observers suspected that Marsh's faster and slower ball were dubious. The reporter did not specify which ball he questioned, except to say that one ball per over was doubtful. The events in Australia occurred against a backdrop of a throwing frenzy in England. A fortnight earlier, the captains of the English county teams had drawn up a list of prohibited bowlers. In Australia, Jim Phillips had set the tone by no-balling Australian Test bowler Ernie Jones. The events in England were seen as a catalyst for a clean-up campaign against dubious bowling actions. Historians regarded Marsh as a prime target due to his Indigenous heritage and his supple wrist action.|$|E
5|$|Like Caroline herself (who {{was created}} Baroness Vaughan upon {{the birth of}} their first son), the two boys were granted {{courtesy}} titles, but no official royal decrees were ever issued by Leopold, the Belgian government, or any other foreign state, causing them to be merely honorary. Because of their parents' legally invalid marriage, their two sons were still deemed illegitimate. Upon each of their births, they had been registered in France under Caroline's name; no mention of Leopold or another potential father was made. Despite these facts, there were fears in Belgium that Leopold would recognize his eldest son as heir to the throne. Had Leopold married in a legal civil ceremony, the <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> have indeed inherited the throne, because all classes were equal under the Belgian constitution, and thus their marriage would not have been considered morganatic. In 1910, the two boys were adopted by Antoine Durrieux, whom Caroline married soon after Leopold's death.|$|E

25|$|It was {{reported}} that, with an Indian cotton gin, which is half machine and half tool, {{one man and}} one woman could clean 28 pounds of cotton per day. With a modified Forbes version, one man and a <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> produce 250 pounds per day. If oxen were used to power 16 of these machines, and a few people's labour was used to feed them, they could produce as much work as 750 people did formerly.|$|E
25|$|As {{the snow}} became deeper {{through the night}} there was panic because {{of the fear of}} being buried or suffocated. With {{daylight}} on Sunday, a <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> be heard shouting under the surface and Sunderland was barely conscious. Davidson and the other boy set off to get help but only got a few yards before they were forced back. Throughout the day the blizzard raged and after dark they could see the flares of a search party but their shouts were not heard and they had lost their own flares in the snow. During this night the children were becoming delirious and were dying. On Monday morning Davidson set off by herself to try to get rescue.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} {{experiences}} two separate flashbacks that reveal {{the true nature}} of the Origami Killer. The first takes place 34 years earlier, with two twin brothers playing in a construction site. One of the two, John Sheppard, falls into a broken pipe and gets his leg trapped, just as a rainstorm causes the pipe to begin filling with water. The second occurs shortly after, with John's brother running home to warn their father, only to find him too drunk to help. Scared and confused, the <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> only watch helplessly as his brother drowned. Thus, the Origami Killer was born: a killer who searches for a father willing to sacrifice himself. He kills his victims the same way his brother died. The boy turns out to be Scott; after he reached adulthood, he changed his surname to Shelby. His actions as an investigator are not meant to get justice for his victims; rather, he needed to collect the evidence of his crimes, which he burns in his office wastebasket.|$|E
500|$|King's {{friend and}} colleague, James Bevel, also disputed the {{argument}} that Ray acted alone, stating, [...] "There is no way a ten-cent white <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> develop a plan to kill a million-dollar black man." ...|$|E
500|$|Braille {{was helped}} by the Haüy books, but he also despaired over their lack of depth: the amount of {{information}} kept in such books was necessarily small. Because the raised letters were made in a complex artisanal process using wet paper pressed against copper wire, the children could not hope to [...] "write" [...] by themselves. So that the young Louis could send letters back home, Simon-René provided him with an alphabet made from bits of thick leather. It was a slow and cumbersome process, but the <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> at least trace the letters' outlines and write his first sentences.|$|E

500|$|As Douglas and {{the other}} {{candidates}} went through with their campaigns, Lincoln {{was the only one}} of them who gave no speeches. Instead, he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North, and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. There were thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of [...] "free labor", whereby a common farm <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> work his way to the top by his own efforts. The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a Chicago Tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life, and sold 100,000 to 200,000 copies.|$|E
500|$|The birth date, birthplace, {{and most}} {{of the history of the}} Smoking Man is never categorically confirmed. One {{possible}} version of his past is provided during the fourth-season episode [...] "Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man", where the conspiracy theorists known as The Lone Gunmen claim Smoking Man was first documented in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on August 20, 1940. His father was an ardent communist activist and a spy for the Soviet NKVD who was executed under the Espionage Act of 1917 [...] "before his <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> walk." [...] His mother was a cigarette smoker who died from lung cancer, also when he was an infant. Since he had no surviving family, he became a ward of the state and was sent to various orphanages in the Midwest. He made no friends and spent most of his time reading.|$|E
500|$|Lamb {{returned}} to the penitentiary on 18 April 1966 with a report saying that, if released, he would probably relapse into recidivism. Scott grew nervous as Lamb's release date approached: he believed that allowing Lamb to return home could be dangerous for the community, {{but at the same}} time he was not certain about the young man's psychiatric state, describing it as [...] "borderline" [...] or [...] "marginal". Lamb had, Scott noted, shown some minor improvement since his time in the hospital. Even discounting this, the symptoms observed in Lamb were not consistent and the doctor did not think he had evidence conclusive enough to certify Lamb as mentally unsound. He even still considered that the <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> just be playing immature games with the penal system. In this uncertainty, Scott resolved that he could not bar Lamb's release. The 18-year-old boy left Kingston on 8 June 1966, ten months ahead of schedule, and returned home to Windsor. He was taken in by another uncle, Stanley Hesketh, who lived at 1912 Ford Boulevard. Lamb secured a job as a woodworker on his release and after starting work showed no signs of irregular conduct.|$|E

500|$|With a late start {{into the}} {{handheld}} gaming market, Sega rushed {{to get the}} Game Gear into stores quickly, having lagged behind Nintendo in sales without a handheld on the market. [...] As one method of doing so, Sega based the hardware of the Game Gear on the Master System, albeit with a much larger color palette than its predecessor: the Game Gear supported 4096 colors, compared to the 64 colors supported by the Master System. [...] Part of the intention of this move was to make Master System games easy to port to the Game Gear. [...] Though the Game Gear {{was designed to be}} technologically superior to the Game Boy, its design came at a cost of battery life: whereas the Game <b>Boy</b> <b>could</b> run for more than 30 hours on four AA batteries, the Game Gear required six AA batteries and could only run for three to five hours. [...] With its quick launch in Japan, the handheld sold 40,000 units in its first two days, 90,000 within a month, and the number of back orders for the system was over 600,000. [...] According to Sega of America marketing director Robert Botch, [...] "there is clearly a need for a quality portable system that provides features other systems have failed to deliver. [...] This means easy-to-view, full-colour graphics and exciting quality games that appeal to all ages." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite initial {{misgivings about}} Carisa's design with a desk {{built into the}} foot of the bed (one judge remarked that an active <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> easily hurt himself on the rough edges), her design was named one of the best that night.
