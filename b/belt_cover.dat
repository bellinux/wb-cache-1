The combination of geochemistry and observational astronomy has also made it possible to trace the HED meteorites back to a specific asteroid in the main belt, 4 Vesta.|$|E
5000|$|While angular sizes {{measured}} in degrees {{are useful for}} larger patches of sky (in the constellation of Orion, for example, the three stars of the <b>belt</b> <b>cover</b> about 4.5 degrees of angular size), we need much finer units when talking about the angular size of galaxies, nebulae or other objects of the night sky.Degrees, therefore, are subdivided as follows: ...|$|E

50|$|Typically, {{the main}} armor <b>belt</b> <b>covers</b> the warship from its main deck down to some {{distance}} below the waterline. If, instead of forming the outer hull, the armor belt is built inside the hull, it is installed at a sloped angle for improved protection, as described above.|$|R
5000|$|The VG30i is a 3 L (2,960 cc) engine {{produced}} from 1986 through 1989. It features a throttle body fuel injection system. It {{has a long}} crank snout, a cylinder head temperature sensor positioned behind the timing <b>belt</b> <b>cover,</b> and a knock sensor in the cylinder valley (on California models only). It produces [...] at 4,800 rpm and 226 Nm at 2,800 rpm.|$|E
50|$|The 1.3 L 2A was {{produced}} from 1979 through 1989. 2A motors in 1982 onwards AL20 Tercels {{have a slightly}} different valve cover and timing <b>belt</b> <b>cover</b> than early AL11 Tercels, {{as well as an}} automatic choke, and automatically controlled hot air intake (HAI) system. It also has higher compression ratio, and reformulated combustion chambers to improve the fuel economy and emissions. All variants used belt-driven SOHC eight-valve counter-flow cylinder heads with a single downdraft carburetor.|$|E
50|$|However, {{while the}} Volvo engine designs would {{externally}} {{appear to be}} a domestic Volvo, there are minor differences. The engine mounts are one example along with the oil filter mounting, power steering pump, ECU, timing <b>belt</b> <b>cover</b> and probably the gearbox setup. The camshaft pulleys were inverted by Renault making the Volvo timing marks redundant. The engine must now utilise a specialist alignment tool to set up the timing however this tool can also be used on the same genuine volvo engines. The 2.5 engine is really a 2.4 being 2435cc but was rounded up by Renault.|$|E

5000|$|The early Cycle-Scoot {{featured}} an [...] "exclusive" [...] combination foot throttle and brake {{designed by}} W. W. Skirvin. The rider would push {{down with the}} toe to go, push down with the heel to stop. This design gave the scooter the [...] "hands-free" [...] braking simplicity of a cruiser bicycle. Most Cycle-Scoots had Clinton or Briggs-Stratton engines that would power the scooter to 30 mph. Mileage was claimed to be 100 MPG. Standard accessories included lights, tandem [...] "buddy seat", parking stand, <b>belt</b> <b>cover,</b> foot rests, seat hand rail for passenger, gravel shield, and fork panel. Models include the 500, Deluxe and an army-green model known as [...] "The General" [...] for General Motors.|$|E
5000|$|He {{is known}} for his {{blending}} of contemporary and vintage pieces, creating spaces of 'dynamic tension'. As Anthony Iannacci describes in Design in the Hamptons, [...] "there no singular, rigorous guideline for the origins of the furnishings or art. Instead, pieces of all periods crop up in every room, helping to establish a tension between what is precious and what is not. A contemporary artwork composed of seven wooden hoops commands a wall in the den, for example, while a metal fan <b>belt</b> <b>cover</b> from a long-since-decommissioned tractor, a larger-than-life yellow pencil, and Robert Rauschenberg lithographs hang in the living room." [...] Iannacci emphasizes that this tension is a central feature to the power of Huniford's design as he [...] "plays adroitly with all these conflicting narratives while still maintaining a sense of order and elegance" [...] creating spaces full of 'surprise and wonder'.|$|E
40|$|The {{energy loss}} due to {{indentation}} rolling resistance in {{a conveyor belt}} system can account for up to 60 % of the total power usage. It arises due to an asymmetric pressure distribution as a viscoelastic <b>belt</b> <b>cover</b> is indented by a rigid idler roll. This causes a retarding moment on the idler roll, dependent on the load, speed, idler diameter and {{the properties of the}} conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>cover.</b> As pouch conveyor systems become more prevalent in industry, the supporting structure, and thus the indentation rolling resistance of such systems is of importance. These designs typically employ curved belt profiles, or spherical idlers in order to aid belt tracking and closing. From this, a spherical indentation into a generalised Maxwell backing is modelled, and compared with experimental values. In addition to this, the strain dependency across the contact is investigated...|$|E

The S models include ABS (optional on standard model) and electronically adjustable suspension, called DES (Ducati Electronic Suspension). The S Sport model features carbon fiber air intakes, cam <b>belt</b> <b>covers</b> and rear hugger, while the S Touring model comes with heated grips, hard luggage and a center stand.|$|R

40|$|Energy loss due to {{indentation}} {{rolling resistance}} {{is a major}} factor in belt conveyor design. The determination of the indentation rolling resistance of a conveyor belt over the idler system depends on the properties of the rubber compound of the backing, the method of calculation of the resistance value and, of course the conveyor system parameters like carrying weight, idler radius and belt speed. Two theoretical approaches have been employed to predict the loss to be expected for a particular installation and <b>belt</b> <b>cover</b> rubber. The results of these calculations are compared to direct measurements of the indentation rolling resistance in this paper and conclusions offered on important elements of prediction methodologies...|$|E

5000|$|Timing <b>belts</b> are {{typically}} <b>covered</b> by metal or polymer timing <b>belt</b> <b>covers</b> which require removal for inspection or replacement. Engine manufacturers recommend replacement at specific intervals. [...] The manufacturer may also recommend {{the replacement of}} other parts, such as the water pump, when the timing belt is replaced because the additional cost to replace the water pump is negligible compared {{to the cost of}} accessing the timing belt. In an interference engine, or one whose valves extend into the path of the piston, failure of the timing belt (or timing chain) invariably results in costly and, in some cases, irreparable engine damage, as some valves will be held open when they should not be and thus will be struck by the pistons.|$|R

50|$|A {{limited number}} of the 749 were {{manufactured}} as a race version — the 749R — each with their production number stamped on the triple clamp. This race model was lighter, had a shorter stroke, increased bore and larger valves which allowed it to run more efficiently at higher RPM, and hence, produced more torque and power than the 749/S models. The 749R also came with a larger fuel tank (18.3 L); slipper clutch; Öhlins forks, shock and steering damper; racing cams; titanium valves, valve guides, and connecting rods; magnesium head covers, and carbon fiber <b>belt</b> <b>covers.</b> Its 2004 model had carbon fiber fairings.|$|R
