5000|$|The Barrett M107 is a [...]50 caliber, shoulder-fired, {{semi-automatic}} sniper rifle. Like its predecessors, {{the rifle}} {{is said to}} have manageable recoil for a weapon of its size owing to the barrel assembly that itself absorbs force, moving inward toward the receiver against large springs with every shot. Additionally, the weapon's weight and large muzzle brake also assist in recoil reduction. Various changes were made to the original M82A1 to create the M107, with new features such as a lengthened accessory rail, rear grip, and monopod socket. Barrett has recently been asked to develop a lightweight version of the M107 under the Anti-Materiel Sniper Rifle Congressional Program, and has already come up with a scheme to build important component parts such as the receiver frame and muzzle <b>brake</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> lighter-weight materials.|$|R
