40|$|We {{propose a}} {{definition}} of the <b>efficiency</b> <b>bandwidth</b> for a power amplifier (PA) using a modulated signal as the signal bandwidth at which the amplifier efficiency has dropped {{to a level of}} 90 % of the maximum <b>efficiency</b> at small <b>bandwidth.</b> We introduce a Monte Carlo method to calculate the <b>efficiency</b> <b>bandwidth</b> for some popular PA architectures.

2500|$|Another {{disadvantage}} of AM {{is that it}} is inefficient in power usage; at least two-thirds of the power is concentrated in the carrier signal. [...] The carrier signal contains none of the original information being transmitted (voice, video, data, etc.). [...] However its presence provides a simple means of demodulation using envelope detection, providing a frequency and phase reference to extract the modulation from the sidebands. [...] In some modulation systems based on AM, a lower transmitter power is required through partial or total elimination of the carrier component, however receivers for these signals are more complex and costly. The receiver may regenerate a copy of the carrier frequency (usually as shifted to the intermediate frequency) from a greatly reduced [...] "pilot" [...] carrier (in reduced-carrier transmission or DSB-RC) to use in the demodulation process. Even with the carrier totally eliminated in double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission, carrier regeneration is possible using a Costas phase-locked loop. This doesn't work however for single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission (SSB-SC), leading to the characteristic [...] "Donald Duck" [...] sound from such receivers when slightly detuned. Single sideband is nevertheless used widely in amateur radio and other voice communications both due to its power efficiency and <b>bandwidth</b> <b>efficiency</b> (cutting the RF bandwidth in half compared to standard AM). On the other hand, in medium wave and short wave broadcasting, standard AM with the full carrier allows for reception using inexpensive receivers. The broadcaster absorbs the extra power cost to greatly increase potential audience.|$|E

We {{consider the}} case when we are allowed to code over L blocks. The channel gain is assumed to be constant over a block and channel gains for different blocks are assumed to be independent. The performance measure of interest is the rate of decay of the expected mean squared error with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), called the distortion SNR exponent. We first show that using a broadcast strategy as in [1], but with a different power and rate allocation policy, the optimal distortion SNR exponent can be achieved for <b>bandwidth</b> <b>efficiencies</b> 0 ≤ b MNL 2, we show that the broadcast scheme achieves the optimal exponent of MNL. Special cases of this result have been derived in [1] for the L = 1 case and in [2] for M = N = 1.
