2500|$|Mixing is a {{critical}} step in batter preparation since overmixing causes the gluten to develop excessively and create a batter with too high of a viscosity {{that is difficult to}} pour and does not expand easily. A thick batter that is difficult spreading in the baking iron has an increased water activity of around 0.85. The increased viscosity made it harder for water to evaporate from the waffle causing an increase in water activity. The control waffles with a softer texture had a water activity of 0.74 after cooking. The Aw is less because the softer texture allows the water to evaporate. With an increased storage time, waffle physical and textural properties changes regardless of the batter viscosity. [...] Aged waffles shrink because air <b>bubbles</b> <b>leak</b> out and the structure starts to condense. Hardness and viscosity also increases as time goes by. Aged waffle samples displayed a starch retrogradation peak that increased with storage time {{due to the fact that}} more crystalline structures were present. Starch retrogradation is mentioned previously in this paper. The enthalpy value for melting of starch crystals increased with storage time as well.|$|R

40|$|The use of {{pipelines}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular ways of delivering gas phases as shown by numerous examples in hydrocarbon transportation systems in Arctic regions, oil and gas production facilities in onshore and offshore wells, and municipal gas distribution systems in urban areas. A gas leak from pipelines can cause serious problems not only because of the financial losses associated but also its social and environmental impacts. Therefore, establishing an early leak detection model is vital to safe and secure operations of such pipeline systems. A leak detection model for a single gas phase is presented in this study by using material balance and pressure traverse calculations. The comparison between two steady states, with and without leak, makes it possible to quantify the magnitude of disturbance in two <b>leak</b> detection <b>indicators</b> such as the change in inlet pressure (ΔP in) and the change in outlet flow rate (Δq out) in a broad range of leak locations (x leak) and leak opening sizes (d leak).  The results from the fit to large-scale experimental data of Scott and Yi (1998) show that the value of leak coefficient (C D), which is shown to be the single-most important but largely unknown parameter, ranges from 0. 55 to 4. 11, and should be a function of Reynolds number (N Re) which is related to leak characteristics such as leak location (x leak), leak opening size (d leak), leak rate (q leak) and system pressure. Further investigations show that between the two <b>leak</b> detection <b>indicators,</b> the change in outlet flow rate (Δq out) is superior to the change in inlet pressure (ΔP in) because of larger disturbance, if the pressure drop along the pipeline is relatively small compared to the outlet pressure; otherwise, the change in inlet pressure (ΔP in) is superior to the change in outlet flow rate (Δq out).

40|$|AbstractNuclear {{fuel cycle}} {{facility}} under construction at Kalpakkam houses more than 200 process vessels and equipments of different capacity and configurations and about 62 Kms of piping of varying sizes from 8 DN to 250 DN in about 5000 m 3 of concrete cell volume. Austenitic stainless steel 304 L {{has been widely}} used as work horse material for this plant due to its resistance to corrosion in acidic environment. The fabrication works of this facility involves more than 70000 weld joints for interconnecting various vessels, equipment and associated piping system. Pneumatic pressure testing and soap <b>bubble</b> <b>leak</b> testing are the two methods effectively {{used to assess the}} final integrity of the system after fabrication and erection. Physical verification of entire piping system as per the approved as-built drawing is a pre pneumatic test requirement. During physical verification, entire piping system will be physically scanned by visual inspection methods for orientation, gradient and also to identify any surface imperfections. Even though all surfaces of the piping system are examined before giving clearance for welding, the surfaces will be re-examined prior to integrity testing to ensure that piping system orientation is as per approved design and its surfaces are free from damages. Orientation and slope {{plays an important role in}} nuclear fuel cycle facility. Because nuclear fuel cycle facility is designed in such a way that gravitational force is effectively used to transfer process fluid to avoid the usage of moving mechanical parts. This is one of the zero maintenance design feature of nuclear fuel cycle facility. Based on experience many procedures are developed to ensure the intended design requirements. Before proceeding to the integrity testing, one has to verify the completion of all quality control stage inspection activities during fabrication by way of documents verification pertaining to the weld joints and loop involved in the testing. All inspection documents right from raw material identification, fabrication and inspection of components are to be verified prior to integrity testing. Verification of large number of inspection related documents posses a very big challenge. To meet this herculean task in time, an asset management system is designed and developed in house. Asset management system plays a key role in storage and retrieval of all inspection credentials and NDE images involved in the system, and with least amount of time these can be retrieved and verified. The asset management system also plays a constructive role during the pre commissioning activities of the plant.

40|$|This report {{investigates the}} {{detection}} of small leaks from the primary system of a Nuclear Pressurised Water Reactor. Leak rates of 12 g/s are invariably difficult to detect and locate. The typical <b>leak</b> <b>indicators</b> in a nuclear reactor control room are a drop in pressure and level from the pressuriser, and the air sampler detecting particulate matter. However, {{in both cases the}} leak is normally quite substantial by the time any parameters or values are obviously outside the normal operating conditions. Therefore, a small leak could go undetected for a significant amount of time. As part of the reactor safety studies, {{it is important to have}} more information about small leaks. Due to the lack of small leak data, the solution was to construct a high pressure water rig producing temperatures and pressures close to those experienced in the primary circuit, these being 200 ºC and 100 bar respectively. Pressure is maintained by a vane water pump and heating is achieved by passing a high current through a small diameter, thin walled pipe. To reproduce different size cracks, various size carburettor jets are used. The water on exiting this crack, flashes to steam and immediately meets metallic pipe lagging, which is typical of most primary systems. With the typical crack scenario recreated it is now important to add sensors that will detect conditions associated with a small leak. These sensors are either mounted on or around the lagging material. The parameters that are monitored include vibrations, acoustics, thermal variations, moisture change, air flow and pressure adjustment leaving a predetermined outlet. The sensor outputs are pre-processed and the nonlinear data are applied to an artificial neural network, whereas the other data are applied to a digital logic system. The results showed that with 13 different leak rates, separated by only 1. 4 g/s the ANN was able to correctly differentiate and identify different leak sizes with a certainty of over 97 %. The results from all the analysis are further presented graphically through an Operator Advisory System. This informs the operator of the predicted leak size and location. All of the available sensor data relevant to the leak can be viewed and location of the leak is presented by a three dimensional model of the reactor system.

40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is {{increasingly}} {{being used in}} nuclear reactor safety analysis as a tool that enables safety related physical phenomena occurring in the reactor coolant system to be {{described in more detail}} and accuracy. Validation is a necessary step in improving predictive capability of a computationa code or coupled computational codes. Validation refers to the assessment of model accuracy incorporating any uncertainties (aleatory and epistemic) that may be of importance. The uncertainties must be identi ed, quanti ed and if possible, reduced. In the rst part of this thesis, a discussion on the development of an approach and experimental facility for the validation of coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics codes and System Thermal Hydraulics (STH) codes is given. The validation of a coupled code requires experiments which feature signi cant two-way feedbacks between the component (CFD sub-domain) and the system (STH sub-domain). Results of CFD analysis that are used {{in the development of a}} exible design of the TALL- 3 D experimental facility are presented. The facility consists of a lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) thermal-hydraulic loop operating in forced and natural circulation regimes with a heated pool-type 3 D test section. Transient analysis of the mixing and strati cation phenomena in the 3 D test section under forced and natural circulation conditions in the loop show that the test section outlet temperature deviates from that predicted by analytical solution (which the 1 D STH solution essentially is). Also an experimental validation test matrix according to the key physical phenomena of interest in the new experimental facility is developed. In the second part of the thesis we consider the risk related to steam generator tube leakage or rupture (SGTL/R) in a pool-type design of lead-cooled reactor (LFR). We demonstrate that there is a possibility that small steam <b>bubbles</b> <b>leaking</b> from the SGT will be dragged by the turbulent coolant ow into the core region. Voiding of the core might cause threats of reactivity insertion accident or local damage (burnout) of fuel rod cladding. Trajectories of the bubbles are determined by the bubble size and turbulent ow eld of lead coolant. The main objective of such study is to quantify likelihood of steam bubble transport to the core region in case of SGT leakage in the primary coolant system of the ELSY (European Lead-cooled SYstem) design. Coolant ow eld and bubble motion are simulated by CFD code Star-CCM+. First, we discuss drag correlations for a steam bubble moving in liquid lead. Thereafter the steady state liquid lead ow eld in the primary system is modeled according to the ELSY design parameters of nominal full power operation. Finally, the consequences of SGT leakage are modeled by injecting bubbles in the steam generator region. An assessment of the probability that bubbles can reach the core region and also accumulate in the primary system, is performed. The most dangerous leakage positions in the SG and bubble sizes are identi ed. Possible design solutions for prevention of core voiding in case of SGTL/R are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|The hydrodynamical {{interaction}} between freely expanding supernova ejecta and a relativistic wind injected {{from the central}} region is studied in analytic and numerical ways. As {{a result of the}} collision between the ejecta and the wind, a geometrically thin shell surrounding a hot bubble forms and expands in the ejecta. We use a self-similar solution to describe the early dynamical evolution of the shell and carry out a two-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamic simulation to follow further evolution. The Rayleigh-Taylor instability inevitably develops at the contact surface separating the shocked wind and ejecta, leading to the complete destruction of the shell and the leakage of hot gas from the hot <b>bubble.</b> The <b>leaking</b> hot materials immediately catch up with the outermost layer of the supernova ejecta and thus different layers of the ejecta are mixed. We present the spatial profiles of hydrodynamical variables and the kinetic energy distributions of the ejecta. We stop the energy injection when a total energy of $ 10 ^{ 52 }$ erg, which is 10 times larger than the initial kinetic energy of the supernova ejecta, is deposited into the ejecta and follow the subsequent evolution. From the results of our simulations, we consider expected emission from supernova ejecta powered by the energy injection at the centre and discuss the possibility that superluminous supernovae and broad-lined Ic supernovae could be produced by similar mechanisms.

Intraoperative anastomotic air {{testing of}} stapled {{colorectal}} anastomosis is performed by filling the pelvis with saline solution and insufflating the rectum with air through a sigmoidoscope. The presence of air <b>bubbles</b> indicates anastomotic <b>leaks</b> which are resolved during surgery. Objective. The {{aim of this}} prospective, randomized study was to perform a comparative analysis regarding the number of anastomotic dehiscences in patients checked by air leak testing and {{in the control group}} without air testing. Methods. After stapled colorectal anastomosis was performed, patients were randomized into two groups of 30 patients. The first group patients underwent intraoperative anastomotic air testing, whereas in the control group this procedure was not performed. The two groups were matched for age, sex, diagnosis and surgical procedure. Results. Intraoperative air tests were positive in seven cases and anastomotic defects were repaired. After surgery, there were three clinical leaks in this group of patients. In the control group, there were six leaks (Unilateral Fischer’s exact test, p= 0. 24). The incidence of colorectal anastomotic dehiscences in the study group was lower than in the control group by 50 %. However, this finding was not statistically significant in our sample. Conclusion.

Under a given leakage flux, simulations show that the bubble size affects the maximum pCO 2 dissolved in the water column, while the bubble interactions affect the vertical bubble distribution. The maximum modelled pCO 2 increases from a background 360 μatm to 400, 427 and 443 μatm as CO 2 injection rates increase from 80, 170 to 208 kg/day respectively at low tide.

40|$|AbstractThe dynamic {{characteristics}} of CO 2 bubbles in Scottish seawater are investigated through observational {{data obtained from}} the QICS project. Images of the <b>leaked</b> CO 2 <b>bubble</b> plume rising in the seawater were captured. This observation {{made it possible to}} discuss the dynamics of the CO 2 <b>bubbles</b> in plumes <b>leaked</b> in seawater from the sediments. Utilising ImageJ, an image processing program, the underwater recorded videos were analysed to measure the size and velocity of the CO 2 bubbles individually. It was found that most of the bubbles deform to non-spherical bubbles and the measured equivalent diameters of the CO 2 bubbles observed near the sea bed are to be between 2 and 12 mm. The data processed from the videos showed that the velocities of 75 % of the <b>leaked</b> CO 2 <b>bubbles</b> in the plume are in the interval 25 – 40 cm/s with Reynolds numbers (Re) 500 – 3500, which are relatively higher than those of an individual bubble in quiescent water.

40|$|Background {{and study}} aim: Colonic {{perforation}} {{is a serious}} complication of colonoscopy, with surgical repair usually indicated. The aim was to compare acute strength of various endoscopic colonic closure techniques by assessing air leak pressures in a previously described ex vivo experimental apparatus. Methods: Standardized colonic perforations were created using fresh porcine colon and subsequently closed on a bench. Six techniques included surgical suture (gold standard), QuickClips, T-tags, over-the-scope-clip (OTSC) system, and two types of flexible stapler (Covidien). After closure, each specimen was fixed in the apparatus and pressure was gradually increased until air <b>bubbles</b> were seen. <b>Leak</b> pressure was the primary outcome parameter. Closure using the gold standard (first 15 experiments) resulted in a mean leak pressure of 86. 9 mmHg (SD 7). Using a noninferiority design a sample size of 12 specimens for each closure technique was determined. Results: Mean colotomy leak pressures in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and difference (with 95 % confidence intervals [CI]) between each technique and the gold standard were: QuickClips 85. 1 (difference - 1. 8; 95 % CI - 7. 0 to 3. 9); T-tags 53. 9 (difference - 33. 0; - 39. 0 to - 27. 0); OTSC 90. 3 mmHg (difference 3. 4; - 6. 1 to 12. 9); 15 -mm shaft stapler 98. 5 mmHg (difference 9. 7; 0. 8 to 18. 5) and 8 -mm shaft stapler 96. 6 mmHg (difference 11. 6; 1. 5 to 21. 7).

40|$|Seabed-originating {{gas bubble}} seeps have been {{observed}} worldwide {{from a variety of}} sources (e. g. Hovland and Judd, 1988) and are most frequently composed of methane and carbon dioxide. Some seabed gas leaks, such as “melting” methane hydrates, may intensify in the coming decades and are a subject of concern in the context of warming seas (Kvenvolden et al., 1993; Archer, 2007). The subsea gas extraction industry and proposed carbon dioxide storage in geological structures under the seabed are examples of potential manmade sources of gas <b>bubble</b> <b>leaks</b> (IPCC, 2005; DNV, 2010), and require swift and precise leak detection and identification. Active acoustic methods are well suited for rapid and cost effective monitoring of large water volumes. Scientific fisheries echo sounders provide calibrated, quantitative measures and are widely used in fish stock monitoring (Simmonds and MacLennan, 2005). As such, these were chosen within the umbrella R&D projects (AKUGAS and AALDOG), the needs of which shaped the scope and objectives of this doctoral study. Bottom-mounted echo sounders, observing laterally along the seabed are considered suitable for gas <b>leak</b> detection. Gas <b>bubble</b> plumes are easy to detect with echo sounders, but separating them from fish and plankton is not always straight forward, as some required information is lacking both for gas bubble plumes and biological targets. This lack is addressed here via selected case studies. In Paper I, the acoustic backscatter properties and natural body tilt orientation were investigated for a common schooling fish that lacks a swim bladder, lesser sandeel (Ammodytes marinus). Its natural orientation distribution was measured using optical measurement methods and is a crucial parameter affecting the acoustic backscattering from animals that are large enough to be directive targets at commonly used echo sounder frequencies. A more advanced stereo photogrammetric method was adapted and improved to fit the needs of this doctoral study in Paper II. These were implemented to characterize the natural tilt orientation distribution of euphausiids (Euphausia superba and Meganyctiphanes norvegica) in several in situ and ex situ experiments (Paper II). Krill natural tilt orientation was measured to have a rather large variability (SD of up to 30 - 37 °). This suggests, but does not prove, that dorsal and lateral aspect krill acoustic backscatter should not be drastically different due to the variable swimming behaviour and body postures adopted by these animals. Such knowledge will be useful for krill multi-frequency identification and target strength averaging either from models or from empirical data. The stereo photogrammetric measurement method (Paper II) was later applied to support fine scale acoustic backscatter measurements on gas bubble plumes (Paper IV) and saithe (Pollachius virens) (Paper III). In Paper III, the lateral aspect acoustic backscatter of saithe was characterised at 70, 120, 200 and 333 kHz. Saithe is a good representative of large, acoustically directive schooling fish that also possesses a gas-filled swim bladder. These can create strong and similar acoustic targets to plumes of free gas bubbles rising from the seabed. Saithe lateral aspect acoustic frequency response (r(f)) was measured based on both schools, single acoustic targets and single target tracks. It was found to have an opposite trend across the acoustic frequency band compared to dorsal aspect saithe r(f) as reported in the literature. The reasons for such discrepancy are discussed along with the implications for acoustic target identification. Similarly, lateral aspect acoustic backscatter properties were characterised for induced methane, carbon dioxide and air bubble plumes at 70, 120, 200 and 333 kHz (Paper IV). A distinct gas plume frequency response was measured for gas bubbles of non-resonant size and is significantly different from the lateral aspect r(f) of saithe. In synthesis, the similarity in acoustic backscattering between a gas bubble and biological targets possessing gas inclusions is discussed, both from a literature review and the investigations included here (Papers I-IV). The prospects of acoustic-based gas bubble plume detection and identification are discussed in the context of obscuring and confounding biological targets. Acoustic frequency response, routinely used to identify some fish and plankton for species or taxa (e. g. Korneliussen and Ona, 2002; 2003; Anon., 2005), is discussed for laterally observed seabed gas bubble plumes. Lateral aspect gas bubble plumes and swim bladder bearing fish frequency response was not available and hence was measured in Papers III and IV. Based on the available research and that defended here (Papers I-IV), it is suggested that behavioural and acoustic backscattering differences can be used to separate gas bubble plumes from the most common biological targets, plankton and fish. Gas-filled swim bladder bearing fish are the most similar biological acoustic targets to the gas bubble plumes. Schooling and swim bladder bearing fish that are quite directive acoustic targets can be separated using the acoustic frequency response information (indications in Paper III). Smaller, but abundant swim bladder bearing fish, such as members from Myctophidae and Sternoptychidae, can be difficult to separate acoustically from a single gas bubble. However, the behaviour of such fish assemblages is substantially different from the gas bubble plumes. Using both backscattering frequency response and behaviour traits (at one time instance and over time) are likely to give the best chances for acoustic-based detection and identification of seabed gas bubble plumes. </p...|$|R
