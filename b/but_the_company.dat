5|$|Port Columbus International Airport was {{formerly}} a hub of America West Airlines in the 1990s, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> closed the hub in 2003 due to financial losses and the post 9/11-decline in air travel.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish state railways, SJ also {{operate on}} the {{southern}} part of Gardermoen on their intercity services X 2000. This was for some years provided by Linx, a joint venture between SJ and NSB, using X2 stock, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> was later dissolved.|$|E
5|$|A major {{complication}} in remastering {{the original}} work was having {{many of the}} critical game files go missing or on archaic formats. A large number of backup files were made on Digital Linear Tape (DLT) which Disney/LucasArts {{had been able to}} recover for Double Fine, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> had no drives to read the tapes. Former LucasArts sound engineer Jory Prum had managed to save a DLT drive and was able to extract all of the game's audio development data from the tapes.|$|E

5|$|Between the 30th and the 1st, The Sun {{reported}} that the remaining strikers had declared they would not interfere, but were confident the company {{would be unable to}} find sufficient workers without them, and that by remaining united, they could yet see their terms met. Given notice to report to work on Monday, July 30 or be discharged from the company, most chose discharge, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> had little trouble in acquiring the workers needed to run the trains.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mid-19th}} century, Pittsburgh {{witnessed}} a dramatic influx of German immigrants, including a brick mason whose son, Henry J. Heinz, founded the H.J. Heinz Company in 1872. Heinz {{was at the}} forefront of reform efforts to improve food purity, working conditions, hours, and wages, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> bitterly opposed the formation of an independent labor union.|$|E
5|$|During this period, 1st Airborne Division was {{composed}} of only two parachute battalions, of which only one (1st Parachute Battalion), was fully trained. Browning, wishing to keep 1st Parachute Battalion intact for any larger operation the division might be selected for, ordered 2nd Parachute Battalion to provide a company for the operation. 'C' Company commanded by Major John Frost was selected, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> had been so recently formed that Frost {{and many of his}} men had not yet completed their parachute jumping course.|$|E

50|$|It {{comes as}} no {{surprise}} that longtime Dinobot fan Simon Furman intended to feature the characters in Dreamwave's Energon comic book, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>company's</b> closure prevented this.|$|R
5|$|From the 1980s to the present, Apple {{has been}} {{plaintiff}} or defendant in civil {{actions in the}} United States and other countries. Some of these actions have determined significant case law for the information technology industry and many have {{captured the attention of}} the public and media. Apple's litigation generally involves intellectual property disputes, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> has also been a party in lawsuits that include antitrust claims, consumer actions, commercial unfair trade practice suits, defamation claims, and corporate espionage, among other matters.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers are {{sometimes}} used as symbols, as in Sir Thomas Gresham's gilded grasshopper in Lombard Street, London, dating from 1563; {{the building was}} for a while {{the headquarters of the}} Guardian Royal Exchange, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> declined to use the symbol for fear of confusion with the locust.|$|E
5|$|Loki Games {{worked on}} a Linux version of the game, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> went out of {{business}} before releasing it.

50|$|On June 15, 2015, Actavis, plc {{changed its}} name to Allergan, plc, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>company's</b> U.S. and Canadian {{generics}} business will continue to operate under the Actavis name.|$|R
50|$|The car was {{a stylish}} high {{performance}} sporting design <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>company's</b> lack of both industrial backing and a volume selling standard model meant that the project was short-lived.|$|R
50|$|Subsequently, LME, Inc. was formed. LME {{has been}} {{referred}} to as the former name of Lakeville Motor Express, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> have been listed as separate entities in legal decisions.|$|R

The line pioneered the regular passage of ocean-going vessels along the Manchester Ship Canal. Its main sphere of operation was the transatlantic shipping trade, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> also operated {{services to the}} Mediterranean. All of the line's vessels were registered in the Port of Manchester, and many were lost to enemy action during the First and Second World Wars.|$|E
5|$|The butcher Allen of Mayfair {{was founded}} in a shop on Mount Street in 1830. It {{was one of the}} most {{well-known}} butchers in London and held a Royal warrant of appointment to supply meat to the Queen, as well as supplying several high-profile restaurants in the area. Following spiralling debts, it was sold to Rare Butchers of Distinction in 2006. The Mayfair premises closed in 2015, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> retains an online presence.|$|E
5|$|The factory {{was located}} on the rocky banks of the Poesten Kill, a creek that was {{commonly}} used for water power in the area. Allen had two new buildings erected and funneled creek water to them through tunnels in the bedrock underneath the buildings. He named his enterprise the Millville Manufacturing Company and converted the mill into an auger and bit factory. At one point, he experimented with producing cable chains and files, as well. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> soon ran into legal difficulties and was dissolved.|$|E
50|$|Nudie Jeans specialises in raw and prewashed denim jeans, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>company's</b> {{collection}} {{includes many}} other items of casual clothing & accessories. In 2003, denim jeans comprised 70% {{of their total}} sales.|$|R
50|$|Pavel {{approached}} electronics manufacturers such as ITT, Grundig, Yamaha and Philips {{with his}} invention, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> felt {{that no one}} would ever want to wear headphones in public for listening to music.|$|R
50|$|On December 31, 2016, L3's {{company name}} changed from L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. to L3 Technologies, Inc. to better reflect <b>the</b> <b>company's</b> wider focus since its {{founding}} in 1997. <b>The</b> <b>company's</b> website changed from L-3com.com to L3T.com, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>company's</b> NYSE ticker symbol of LLL remained the same.|$|R
5|$|With the {{delivery}} of the first Cray-3, Seymour Cray immediately {{moved on to the}} similar-but-improved Cray-4 design, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> went bankrupt before it was completely tested. The Cray-3 was Cray's last completed design; with CCC's bankruptcy he formed SRC Computers to concentrate on parallel designs, but died in a car accident in 1996 before this work was delivered.|$|E
5|$|After {{the deal}} in Marysville fell through, ISC courted another site, this time south of Bremerton National Airport in Bremerton, WA just across Puget Sound from Seattle. Although like the Marysville {{proposal}} the proposal in Bremerton {{was to be}} partially funded with public money, the money will not come directly from taxes but instead from bonds funded by taxes, in a scheme {{similar to the one}} used to fund Kansas Speedway. Also like the Marysville proposal, the Bremerton track would be publicly owned and leased to ISC for three races per year. ISC's current proposal was met with a lukewarm response from area lawmakers and citizens, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> has promised to present an improved offer for early 2007.|$|E
5|$|Ambitious {{reporter}} Amy Harkin (Nancy McKeon) {{is stuck}} {{reporting on the}} heat wave while trying to find proof behind the scenes that Lexer and Midwest {{are responsible for the}} lack of sufficient power. The Secretary of Energy, Shirley Abbott (Dianne Wiest), is actively warning various politicians and the president that the power grid is too outdated to handle real natural disasters and that it is too vulnerable to attack. Dan London (Ari Cohen), the chief engineer of Lexer, has also repeatedly warned Lexer that their systems are too vulnerable to hackers, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> is only interested in going with the cheapest options. He decides to blow the whistle on the company to Harkin, but as he refuses to appear on camera, Harkin's boss will not allow the piece to air.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>company</b> was mobilized in January 1941 for {{one year}} of {{training}} with the Yankee Division. The year of training ended in December 1941 <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>company's</b> service continued after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into the Second World War.|$|R
50|$|In September 2001, eBay {{purchased}} a 19.5% stake in <b>the</b> <b>company.</b> eBay sold its stake in MercadoLibre in 2016, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> continue to collaborate to expand eBay sellers into Latin America. eBay opened its first branded {{store on the}} MercadoLibre marketplace from Chile in March 2017.|$|R
50|$|In the 1910s Alkmaar Packet {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of much larger saloon ships than previously in use. Also, they weren't steamers <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>company's</b> first motor vessels. The Alkmaar of 1912 could carry up to 1300 passengers on three decks.|$|R
5|$|At Kilve are {{the remains}} of a red brick retort, built in 1924, when it was {{discovered}} that the shale found in the cliffs was rich in oil. The beach is part of the Blue Anchor to Lilstock Coast SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest). Along this coast the cliffs are layered with compressed strata of oil-bearing shale and blue, yellow and brown lias embedded with fossils. In 1924 Forbes-Leslie founded the Shaline Company to exploit them. This retort house is thought to be the first structure erected here for the conversion of shale to oil <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> was unable to raise sufficient capital and this is now all that remains of the anticipated Somerset oil boom.|$|E
5|$|Gene therapy {{typically}} {{involves the}} use of a non-infectious virus (i.e., a viral vector such as the adeno-associated virus) to shuttle genetic material into a part of the brain. The gene used leads to the production of an enzyme that helps to manage PD symptoms or protects the brain from further damage. In 2010 there were four clinical trials using gene therapy in PD. There have not been important adverse effects in these trials although the clinical usefulness of gene therapy is still unknown. One of these reported positive results in 2011, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> filed for bankruptcy in March 2012.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, mining {{operations}} in Silver Reef resumed {{under the direction}} of Alex Colbath, who organized the area's mines into the Silver Reef Consolidated Mining Company. These mines were purchased by American Smelting and Refining Company in 1928, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> did minimal work {{as a result of the}} Great Depression. The Western Gold & Uranium Corporation purchased Silver Reef's mines in 1948, and in 1951, they began mining uranium in the area. These operations did not last long either, and the Western Gold & Uranium Corporation sold their mines to the 5M Corporation in 1979. Today, the Wells Fargo office, the Cosmopolitan Restaurant, the Rice Building, and numerous foundations and walls remain in the town site, and a few dozen homes have been constructed in the area.|$|E
