5|$|MLB {{issued a}} {{statement}} that Ramirez had <b>been</b> <b>informed</b> of an issue under the Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment program, and chose to retire rather than continue with the appeal process. Ramirez was facing a 100-game suspension, which would still apply if Ramirez {{decided to return to}} MLB in the future. Neither Ramirez nor the MLB Players Association {{issued a statement}} about the sudden retirement. Ramirez apparently did not personally inform the Rays about his decision. The team announced that they had <b>been</b> <b>informed</b> of his retirement by the MLB Commissioner's Office.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a two-player contest for a prize of common but uncertain value. We show that less resources are spent in equilibrium if one party <b>is</b> privately <b>informed</b> {{about the value}} of a prize than if either both agents <b>are</b> <b>informed</b> or neither agent <b>is</b> <b>informed.</b> Furthermore, the uninformed agent is ex ante strictly more likely to win the prize than <b>is</b> the <b>informed</b> agent...|$|R

5|$|On May 7, Schiavo's parents {{made public}} a {{complaint}} {{that they had}} not <b>been</b> <b>informed</b> of when and where the ashes of their daughter had been (or were to be) buried by Michael Schiavo. He was under court order to provide this information to them.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the degree to}} which newly diagnosed patients with advanced lung cancer wanted to <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> and involved in medical decision-making, and whether the patients felt their preferences were met. Patients from 13 hospitals in Flanders were interviewed with a standard questionnaire. A total of 128 patients (68 %) participated. Of the patients who wanted to <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> about life expectancy, half (53 %) reported they <b>were</b> <b>informed,</b> and of those who wanted to <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> about palliative care and end-of-life decisions, 25 % and 31 % said they <b>were</b> <b>informed,</b> respectively. With regard to participation in medical decision-making (in general, about treatment, transfer or end-of-life), patients who preferred the doctor to make decisions or those who preferred to make the decision themselves often achieved this (in their perception), while patients who wanted an in-between position with some involvement, often did not. To conclude, preferences of patients with lung cancer for information concerning delicate topics and for shared decision-making with the physician were not well met...|$|R

5|$|Secrecy for the {{operation}} was so tight that not all German ground and naval forces had <b>been</b> <b>informed</b> of {{the operation}} and some units suffered casualties from friendly fire. British signals intelligence (Ultra) recorded the movement and buildup of German air forces in the region, but did not realise that an operation was imminent.|$|E

5|$|At Springfield Elementary School, Bart is busted for {{vandalism}} by Principal Skinner, who has <b>been</b> <b>informed</b> {{by class}} genius Martin Prince. Faced {{with the prospect}} of failing an intelligence test, Bart surreptitiously switches exams with Martin. When the school psychologist, Dr. Pryor, studies the results, he identifies Bart as a genius, to the delight of Homer and Marge, who enroll him in a new school. However, Lisa is not fooled by his supposed genius and still believes Bart to be a moron; Skinner shares her belief, but takes advantage of Bart's departure from the school.|$|E
5|$|Caligula's {{actions as}} emperor were {{described}} as being especially harsh to the senate, to the nobility and to the equestrian order. According to Josephus, these actions led to several failed conspiracies against Caligula. Eventually, officers within the Praetorian Guard led by Cassius Chaerea succeeded in murdering the emperor. The plot is described as having been planned by three men, but many in the senate, army and equestrian order {{were said to have}} <b>been</b> <b>informed</b> of it and involved in it.|$|E
5|$|Guiscard, however, had <b>been</b> <b>informed</b> of Alexios' arrival by his {{scouts and}} {{on the night of}} October 17, he moved his army from the {{peninsula}} to the mainland. Upon learning of Guiscard's move, Alexios revised his battle plan. He split his army into three divisions, with the left wing under the command of Gregory Pakourianos, the right wing under the command of Nikephoros Melissenos, and himself in command of the centre. Guiscard formed his battle line opposite Alexios's, with the right wing under the command of the Count of Giovinazzo, the left under Bohemond and Guiscard facing Alexios in the centre.|$|E

5|$|Harsha later {{visits a}} water {{bottling}} unit {{which not only}} produces alcoholic beverages but also draws from the village's source of drinking water. He tries to close it, but is attacked by Sashi's henchmen and is hospitalised. Ravikanth, who has <b>been</b> <b>informed</b> of Harsha's adoption of Devarakota, manages to bring Harsha back to Hyderabad, where he joins the office after he recovers. Ravikanth later confronts a visibly upset Harsha and decides to send him back to Devarakota, earning Harsha's love, for which he has long yearned. Harsha hands over the reigns of the business empire to Karthik and leaves.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Russian {{declaration}} of war {{came as a surprise}} to both Carol and Kogălniceanu, who had not <b>been</b> <b>informed</b> of the exact date (April 23) when the Imperial Russian Army would start moving into Moldavia—hence, Romanians tended to regard it as an invasion. Also alarming for Kogălniceanu, the official Russian proclamation addressed Romanians as protegés of the Empire. Bilateral tensions were somewhat alleviated by Russian apologies and, later, by the Ottoman pledge to annex Romania; addressing a discontented Parliament, Kogălniceanu asserted that the Russian road was the country's only choice.|$|E
5|$|Notwithstanding that in NASA's {{judgment}} {{the contractor}} later made {{significant progress in}} overcoming the problems, the committee believes it should have <b>been</b> <b>informed</b> of the situation. The committee does not object {{to the position of}} the Administrator of NASA, that all details of Government/contractor relationships should not be put in the public domain. However, that position in no way can be used as an argument for not bringing this or other serious situations {{to the attention of the}} committee.|$|E

50|$|There is a {{misconception}} that a physician only {{needs to do}} what other physicians typically do (i.e. standard of care). However, {{in the case of}} informed consent, the legal standard is more commonly defined as what a reasonable patient would elect to do if she <b>is</b> <b>informed.</b> So if a reasonable patient would want to be screened if only she <b>is</b> <b>informed</b> or if a reasonable patient would want to receive an amniocentesis if only she <b>is</b> <b>informed</b> of that option, then a physician is legally obligated to inform the patient of these options.|$|R

5|$|The Franco-Spanish squadron, {{comprising}} the 74-gun ships {{of the line}} Europa and Montañés, and the frigates Maria de la Cabeya and Luisa, accompanied by Preneuse and Brûle-Gueule, sailed from Manila on 6 January 1799, {{under the command of}} Rear-Admiral Ignacio Maria de Álava. Alava's squadron crossed the South China Sea in three weeks, arriving in the Wanshan Archipelago near Macau on 27 January 1799 with the intention of attacking shipping at Macau and in the mouth of the Pearl River. Alava had <b>been</b> <b>informed</b> of the presence of Intrepid by Danish merchants but was unaware of the arrival of Rainier's reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|The {{need to keep}} {{information}} secret {{may also}} {{have contributed to the}} delays and the defenders' scepticism. As the auxiliary patrol boat crews, the indicator loop staff, and other personnel manning defensive positions would have been outside 'need to know' and would not have <b>been</b> <b>informed</b> about any of the incidents prior to the attack, they would not have been alert, contributing to the disbelief demonstrated {{in the early hours of}} the attack.|$|E
5|$|A two-day long {{bombardment}} of Flushing forced its capitulation on 15 August. Ratified the following day, {{it left the}} British in control of Walcheren which they garrisoned with 10,000 troops. Schouwen and Duiveland on the Eastern branch of the Scheldt, were occupied peacefully on 17 August. The French fleet had already withdrawn to Antwerp however, having <b>been</b> <b>informed</b> on 29 July when the British were still at sea. Between the British and their objective were now more than 35,000 French soldiers, garrisoned in heavily armed forts at Lillo, Liefkenshoech, and Antwerp. The deliberate destruction of dykes by the French had led to widespread flooding, and with disease spreading through the British army, {{it was decided to}} abandon the expedition in early September.|$|E
