5|$|Upon {{becoming}} {{a tropical storm}}, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning {{from the mouth of}} the Mississippi River to Pensacola, Florida. Sixhours later, the warning was extended westward to Morgan City, Louisiana. The threat of Beryl prompted some voluntary evacuations in St. <b>Bernard</b> <b>Parish</b> in Louisiana, and also forced the evacuations of thousands from offshore oil rigs. Officials advised small craft to remain at port from Port O'Connor, Texas to Pensacola, Florida.|$|E
5|$|When Allison {{first made}} landfall, heavy {{rainfall}} flooded numerous houses and businesses. Minor wind gusts caused minor roof damage to 10houses in Cameron Parish, while its storm surge flooded portions of Louisiana Highway 82. When the system returned, more rainfall occurred, flooding over 1,000houses in St. Tammany Parish, 80 houses in Saint <b>Bernard</b> <b>Parish,</b> {{and hundreds of}} houses elsewhere in the state. The flooding also forced 1,800residents from their homes in East Baton Rouge Parish. The deluge left numerous roads impassable, while runoff resulted in severe river flooding. The Bogue Falaya River in Covington crested past its peak twice to near-record levels. The Amite and Comite Rivers reached their highest levels since 1983. In addition, the levee along the Bayou Manchac broke, flooding roadways and more houses. Damage in Louisiana totaled to $65million (2001USD, $84million 2012USD).|$|E
5|$|In late July, a trough of low pressure, which Hurricane Blanche avoided, was {{situated}} over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. The system developed into Tropical Depression Six at 12:00UTC on July28, while located about 60mi (100km) southwest of Cape San Blas, Florida. The depression {{combined with a}} building high pressure system, resulting {{in the development of}} a strong convergence zone. This, in turn, caused heavy rainfall along the Gulf Coast, particularly in southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. With sustained winds initially at 25mph (35km/h), the storm intensified slightly while tracking west-northwestward. Early on July29, the depression attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 35mph (55km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1010mbar (29.83inHg). Several hours later, it made landfall in a rural area of St. <b>Bernard</b> <b>Parish,</b> Louisiana, with winds of 30mph (45km/h). The system curved northwestward and dissipated at 12:00UTC on July30, shortly after crossing into Mississippi. The remnants continued into northern Louisiana and then turned northward, before dissipating over Arkansas on August3.|$|E

5|$|However, the city's levee {{and flood}} walls {{designed}} and built by the US Army Corps of Engineers breached in over fifty locations. Storm surge breached the levees of the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal ("MR-GO") in approximately 20 places and flooded all of Saint <b>Bernard</b> <b>Parish,</b> the east bank of Plaquemines Parish and the historic Lower Ninth Ward. The major levee breaches in the city included breaches at the 17th Street Canal levee, the London Avenue Canal, and the wide, navigable Inner Harbor Navigation Canal, which left approximately 80% of New Orleans flooded. There were three major breaches at the Industrial Canal; one on the upper side near the junction with MR-GO, and two on the lower side along the Lower Ninth Ward, between Florida Avenue and Claiborne Avenue. The 17th Street Canal levee was breached on the lower (New Orleans West End) side inland from the Old Hammond Highway Bridge, and the London Avenue Canal breached in two places, on the upper side just back from Robert E. Lee Boulevard, and on the lower side a block in from the Mirabeau Avenue Bridge. Flooding from the breaches put {{the majority of the}} city under water for days, in many places for weeks. Many roads and buildings were damaged by Hurricane Katrina.|$|E

25|$|From {{a ground}} survey, the Corps had {{identified}} nine breaches {{that must be}} repaired to provide a minimum level of protection to the affected parishes.
