Liquid extracted from the root bark has been used for headaches or, when diluted, to improve health after childbirth, and the leaves are applied to venereal lesions. The species has been traditionally used for <b>boils</b> in Samoa and Tonga.|$|E
5000|$|DNB is {{also known}} as Transition <b>boiling,</b> {{unstable}} film <b>boiling,</b> and partial film <b>boiling.</b> For water <b>boiling</b> as shown on the graph, transition <b>boiling</b> occurs when the temperature difference between the surface and the <b>boiling</b> water is approximately [...] to [...] above the TS. This corresponds to the high peak and the low peak on the <b>boiling</b> curve. The low point between transition <b>boiling</b> and film <b>boiling</b> is the Leidenfrost point.|$|R

The vapour consists of the dimer Fe2Cl6 (c.f. aluminium chloride) which increasingly dissociates into the monomeric FeCl3 (D3h point group molecular symmetry) at higher temperature, in competition with its reversible decomposition to give iron(II) chloride and chlorine gas.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} way of {{preventing}} bumping is by adding {{one or two}} <b>boiling</b> chips to the reaction vessel. However, these alone may not prevent bumping {{and for this reason}} it is advisable to <b>boil</b> liquids in a <b>boiling</b> tube, a <b>boiling</b> flask, or an Erlenmeyer flask. In addition, heating test tubes should never be pointed towards any person, just in case bumping does occur. Whenever a liquid is cooled below its <b>boiling</b> point and re-heated to a <b>boil,</b> a new <b>boiling</b> chip will be needed, as the pores in the old <b>boiling</b> chip tend to fill with solvent, rendering it ineffective.|$|R
5|$|Geysers are {{temporary}} geological features. Geysers {{are generally}} associated with volcanic areas. As the water <b>boils,</b> the resulting pressure forces a superheated column of steam {{and water to}} the surface through the geyser's internal plumbing. The formation of geysers specifically requires the combination of three geologic conditions that are usually found in volcanic terrain.|$|E

In particular, liquid helium, which <b>boils</b> at , is used for superconducting magnets, such as those needed in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance. Liquid neon, although it does not reach temperatures as low as liquid helium, also finds use in cryogenics because it has over 40times more refrigerating capacity than liquid helium and over three times more than liquid hydrogen.|$|E

Yet another recipe recorded by Li uses the leaves to treat baldness. This formula calls for young leaves of ailanthus, catalpa and peach tree to be crushed together and the resulting liquid applied to the scalp to stimulate hair growth.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, it is a {{colourless}} gas, {{like all}} of the hydrogen halides except hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative iodine atom. It melts at −51.0°C and <b>boils</b> at −35.1°C. It is an endothermic compound that can exothermically dissociate at room temperature, although the process is very slow unless a catalyst is present: the reaction between hydrogen and iodine at room temperature to give hydrogen iodide does not proceed to completion. The H–I bond dissociation energy is likewise {{the smallest of the}} hydrogen halides, at 295kJ/mol.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, {{after the end}} of the Second World War, Hergé was {{continuing}} to produce new instalments of The Adventures of Tintin for the Belgian magazine Tintin, of which he was the artistic director. After completing serialisation of Prisoners of the Sun in April 1949, he ordered his staff to re-serialise one of his old stories, Popol and Virginia, while he took a three-month break. At this point, Hergé was depressed and suffering from a range of physical ailments, including <b>boils</b> and eczema on his hands. Although fed up with The Adventures of Tintin, he felt great pressure on him to continue producing the series for Tintin magazine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Boiling</b> is {{the rapid}} {{vaporization}} of a liquid, which {{occurs when a}} liquid is heated to its <b>boiling</b> point, the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid {{is equal to the}} pressure exerted on the liquid by the surrounding atmosphere. The higher the pressure the higher the <b>boiling</b> point. There are two main types of boiling; nucleate <b>boiling</b> where small bubbles of vapour form at discrete points, and critical heat flux <b>boiling</b> where the <b>boiling</b> surface is heated above a certain critical temperature and a film of vapor forms on the surface. Transition <b>boiling</b> is an intermediate, unstable form of <b>boiling</b> with elements of both types. The <b>boiling</b> point of water is 100 °C or 212 °F, but is lower with the decreased atmospheric pressure found at higher altitudes.|$|R

5|$|Given {{the great}} {{reactivity}} of atomic nitrogen, elemental nitrogen usually occurs as molecular N2, dinitrogen. This molecule is a colourless, odourless, and tasteless diamagnetic gas at standard conditions: it melts at −210°C and <b>boils</b> at −196°C. Dinitrogen is mostly unreactive at room temperature, {{but it will}} nevertheless react with lithium metal and some transition metal complexes. This is due to its bonding, which is unique among the diatomic elements at standard conditions in that it has an N≡N triple bond. Triple bonds have short bond lengths (in this case, 109.76pm) and high dissociation energies (in this case, 945.41kJ/mol), and are thus very strong, explaining dinitrogen's chemical inertness.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen and {{fluorine}} {{combine to}} yield hydrogen fluoride, in which discrete molecules form clusters by hydrogen bonding, resembling water more than hydrogen chloride. It <b>boils</b> {{at a much}} higher temperature than heavier hydrogen halides and unlike them is fully miscible with water. Hydrogen fluoride readily hydrates on contact with water to form aqueous hydrogen fluoride, also known as hydrofluoric acid. Unlike the other hydrohalic acids, which are strong, hydrofluoric acid is a weak acid at low concentrations. However, it can attack glass, something the other acids cannot do.|$|E
