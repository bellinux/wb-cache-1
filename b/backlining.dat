25|$|Insecticides {{have also}} been used often in prevention, but with {{improper}} application and heavy reliance throughout the years, insecticide resistance and residues within the wool have caused much concern. The primary reason for failures in using insecticides is attributed to poor application. Jetting, dipping, and <b>backlining</b> are the three most commonly used methods for insecticide application, {{and most of the}} chemicals used belong to three types of chemicals: synthetic pyrethroids, organophosphates, insect growth regulators and spinosins. Insect growth regulators can provide the long term protection against flies and when applied correctly provide protection during the susceptible times of the year. Resistance to this group of insecticide has been identified. Spinosins are good for short term control of flies and leave no residues in wool. Many government agencies mandate that the wool be free of insecticidal residues forcing withholding periods by farmers before shearing. During this time, the flock can become extremely sensitive to flystrike.|$|E

50|$|<b>Backline</b> {{equipment}} can be rented for concert tours or {{recording studio}} use. Many travelling musicians {{prefer not to}} transport their own <b>backline</b> gear across borders and continents for fear of damage or customs hassles, which makes renting <b>backline</b> equipment while on tour an attractive option. Many music festivals and performance venues provide <b>backline</b> equipment. In some countries, all electronic and electric gear needs documentation and certification by an electrical expert {{before it can be}} brought into the country. Another issue is that some bands may travel to a country or continent which uses a different type of AC mains power and differently-shaped electric plugs.|$|R

For example, pianos need to be tuned and maintained with new felts, tube amplifiers need servicing or new tubes, speaker cabinets may need to have new loudspeakers installed, and drums will need new drumheads. Drumkit moving parts, such as hi-hat cymbal stands, may need adjustments. Guitar techs usually deal with maintaining guitar amps and effects.|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of polymer matrix ear tags impregnated with 8. 5 % w/w cypermethrin to 6 wethers following shearing reduced lice to non-detectable levels on 4 {{of them at}} 29 weeks after tagging. At {{the conclusion of the}} study at 45 weeks the mean count of lice on tagged wethers was 3 per sheep compared to 158 on untreated wethers. In a second experiment, 6 non-infected sheep were treated at shearing with cypermethrin tags, 6 with 25 g/l cypermethrin <b>backline</b> formulation, 6 with tags plus <b>backline</b> and 6 were left untreated. Each group was exposed to 6 sheep with moderate to heavy infestations of lice. Compared to controls, all treatments delayed infestation, but cypermethrin tags gave no longer protection than <b>backline</b> treatment. All sheep were infested by 17 weeks after commencement of the study. At 45 weeks mean counts of lice were 38, 27, 20 and 74 respectively for sheep treated with tags, <b>backline</b> formulation, <b>backline</b> plus tags and untreated. Possible reasons for the better effect observed from applying tags to infested sheep than to sheep which were not infected at application but which were subsequently exposed to infested sheep are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|In music {{industry}} parlance, the amplifiers {{and some of}} the instruments are nicknamed the [...] "backline." [...] <b>Backline</b> instruments are commonly provided for bands at music festivals and other concerts where several bands will play during an event. By providing these <b>backline</b> instruments, this speeds up the changeover process when new bands take the stage. The <b>backline</b> typically includes large and heavy items that are hard to transport, including large bass amplifiers and guitar amplifiers and their speaker cabinets, the drum kit (usually minus the cymbals and the snare drum, which each drummer brings from home), a Hammond organ, stage piano, and a keyboard amplifier. Even when a venue or festival provides a [...] "backline", musicians must still supply some instruments themselves, such as guitars, an electric bass, and, in some cases, the cymbals and/or the snare drum. The venue informs musicians about which instruments are supplied as the <b>backline</b> for a specific concert or stage and in many cases, the contract signed by the band and the venue/promoter contains an explicit list of the <b>backline</b> gear that will be on stage, even specifying brand names and model numbers.|$|R
