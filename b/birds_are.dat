5|$|<b>Birds</b> <b>are</b> now {{recognized}} {{as being the}} sole surviving lineage of theropod dinosaurs. In traditional taxonomy, birds were considered a separate class that had evolved from dinosaurs, a distinct superorder. However, a majority of contemporary paleontologists concerned with dinosaurs reject the traditional style of classification in favor of phylogenetic taxonomy; this approach requires that, for a group to be natural, all descendants {{of members of the}} group must be included in the group as well. <b>Birds</b> <b>are</b> thus considered to be dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. <b>Birds</b> <b>are</b> classified as belonging to the subgroup Maniraptora, which are coelurosaurs, which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Leicestershire and Rutland are {{landlocked}} lowland {{counties and}} most of the <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> typical of English farmland habitat. Many coastal, oceanic and highland <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> absent or rare, and there are few rare vagrants compared to coastal areas. The construction of two large reservoirs, Eyebrook Reservoir in 1940 and Rutland Water (England's largest reservoir) in 1976, has provided freshwater environments enabling many aquatic birds to thrive.|$|E
5|$|The {{average life}} span of the American crow in the wild is 7–8 years. Captive <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> known to have lived up to 30 years.|$|E
5000|$|Wood chip <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> {{a carved}} wooden item with thin wavy plumage of the wings. The plumage and tail of these <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> usually made of split pine, that <b>is</b> why the <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> called [...] "wood chip". The {{place of the}} wooden toy origin {{in the form of}} a <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> the Arkhangelsk region. It’s also called a [...] "Pomor dove".|$|R
50|$|The {{drinking}} <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> {{dating back}} to 1910s~1930s.The drinking <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> patented in the US in 1945 and 1946 by two different inventors.|$|R
25|$|<b>Bird</b> remains <b>are</b> very fragmentary {{because of}} their {{delicate}} structure. At least one aquatic <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> known. Based on the diversity of birds from the Early Cretaceous of China, other <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> probably present in Utah at this time as well.|$|R
5|$|The family Cuculidae {{includes}} cuckoos, roadrunners and anis. These <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> {{of variable}} size with slender bodies, long tails and strong legs.|$|E
5|$|The {{scales of}} <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> {{thought to be}} {{homologous}} to those of reptiles and mammals.|$|E
5|$|The spill cleanup {{occurred}} during the nesting season for snowy plovers so special precautions were necessary while cleaning up tar balls. The <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> often found on the beaches {{along the coast of}} the Oxnard plain. Their nests are hard to see in the open sand and the <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> easily frightened away by human activity leaving the eggs to fast-moving predators such as sea gulls. Least terns were another endangered species of bird that was a concern during the cleanup efforts.|$|E
5000|$|In 1999 seven {{birds and}} in 2000 again 10 <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> {{released}}. Thus in all 31 sub-adult <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> {{released in the}} pre-selected proper habitat of the birds.|$|R
50|$|The {{association}} of Apsat with fish and <b>birds</b> <b>is</b> thought {{to stem from}} the eagle, which, as a fishing <b>bird,</b> <b>is</b> associated with both {{the sky and the}} water.|$|R
50|$|In all cases, a <b>bird's</b> diet <b>is</b> {{carefully}} measured {{to control}} its weight. Weight determines how hungry the <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> and how lazy it will act. A <b>bird</b> that <b>is</b> overweight {{will be more}} likely to fly away or not hunt. A <b>bird</b> that <b>is</b> somewhat underweight will act aggressively, and a <b>bird</b> that <b>is</b> severely underweight will have health problems.|$|R
5|$|The usual {{call of the}} nelicourvi weaver is a high-pitched, very {{distinct}} chizz-chizz-chizz, {{which is}} more metallical and rasping when the <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> in feeding groups. Other calls that can be heard when the <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> at the nest include tsrrreee, tiang-tiang, and chet. The song, which is produced while being at the nest sounds like chiz-chizz-chswriissssiszz.|$|E
5|$|Anatidae {{includes}} the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, bills which are flattened {{to a greater}} or lesser extent, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to special oils.|$|E

5|$|Beavers {{can also}} be found along the river, {{building}} small dams along the river. Night herons, ducks, and other <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> also present along the river.|$|E
5|$|<b>Birds</b> <b>are</b> {{important}} economically, providing substantial {{amounts of}} food, especially protein, largely but not exclusively from the domestic chicken; feathers and down are used for bedding, insulation, and other purposes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Birds</b> <b>are</b> popular {{characters}} in children's books, {{which are often}} handsomely illustrated. Beatrix Potter's 1908 The Tale of Jemima Puddle-duck created an enduringly popular bird heroine. Other authors followed with many bird {{characters in}} books for children of different ages.|$|E
40|$|Cloacal-vent {{prolapse}} in a <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> often fatal if left untreated. A 10 -month-old female love <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> {{brought to}} teaching veterinary hospital, Chittagong Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Bangladesh, {{due to an}} everted cloaca through the vent. This condition was treated successfully by washing, massage, and icing. Calcium was supplemented orally for five days and the <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> cured completely after seven days...|$|R
50|$|The fabulous {{qualities of}} the oozlum <b>bird</b> <b>are</b> {{the subject of a}} poem by W. T. Goodge (1862-1909). In the poem The Oozlum <b>Bird,</b> the <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> said to fly {{backwards}} and has the singular ability of being able to fly up in the air while letting the earth turn under it.

5|$|<b>Birds</b> <b>are</b> {{tetrapods}} {{but though}} their hind limbs {{are used for}} walking or hopping, their front limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for flight. <b>Birds</b> <b>are</b> endothermic, have a high metabolic rate, a light skeletal system and powerful muscles. The long bones are thin, hollow and very light. Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones. The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused. There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak. The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls. They face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks.|$|E
5|$|<b>Birds</b> <b>are</b> {{the primary}} natural {{enemies of the}} Sirex woodwasp. The adults are {{frequently}} hunted by swallows (Hirundidae) and swifts (Apodidae), both of which prefer males. The black woodpecker (Dryocopius martius) and great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopus major) consume some larvae, but do not specialize on the Sirex woodwasp.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{feature in}} a wide variety of art forms, {{including}} in painting, sculpture, poetry and prose, film and fashion. Birds also appear in music as well as traditional dance and ballet.

50|$|This <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> {{named for}} the scaly {{appearance}} of its breast and back feathers. Along with its scaly markings, the <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> easily identified by its white crest that resembles a tuft of cotton.|$|R
25|$|The next {{significant}} {{event was}} on 4 November. Meredith had established an ambush near a local dam, {{and more than}} 1,000 emus were spotted heading towards their position. This time the gunners waited until the <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> in close proximity before opening fire. The gun jammed after only twelve <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> killed and the remainder scattered before any more could be killed. No more <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> sighted that day.|$|R

5|$|Carl Linnaeus {{modified}} {{that work}} in 1758 to devise the taxonomic classification system currently in use. <b>Birds</b> <b>are</b> categorised as the biological class Aves in Linnaean taxonomy. Phylogenetic taxonomy places Aves in the dinosaur clade Theropoda.|$|E
5|$|Dusky woodswallows {{adhere to}} {{seasonal}} migration and movements. The <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> a nomadic species, {{and tend to}} move quite spontaneously. However, one certain change of habitat occurs for the south-eastern birds, who migrate northward for Autumn.|$|E
5|$|Four {{subspecies}} are recognized. They {{differ in}} bill proportion {{and form a}} rough NE-SW clinal in size across North America. <b>Birds</b> <b>are</b> smallest in the far west and on the south coast.|$|E

5000|$|Trapshooting {{has been}} a sport since the late 18th century when real <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> used; usually the {{passenger}} pigeon, which was extremely abundant at the time. <b>Birds</b> <b>were</b> placed under hats or in traps which were then released. Artificial <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> introduced {{around the time of}} the American Civil War. Glass balls (Bogardus) and subsequently [...] "clay" [...] targets were introduced in the later 1800s, [...] gaining wide acceptance.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Birds</b> <b>was</b> MacLeod’s {{first major}} public art commission, and is {{situated}} in Vancouver British Columbia.
