In the mandapa is a seated Nandi facing the garbha ghriya (sacrum sanctum) containing a Shiva linga.|$|E
5|$|Cave 12 {{is a small}} {{dwelling}} {{entered by}} a door from the veranda of cave 11. It has its own open veranda, which has a partly broken floor and ceiling and recessed benches {{on the left and}} right of the door to the middle room. The middle room has a small window {{to the left of the}} door and a seat recess in its right wall. In the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle room to the left is a half cell - which has a seat recess - and a cell with a grooved door. The floor of the cave has a coating of cement, while the ceiling of the middle room bears painted concentric circles.|$|E
50|$|This is {{considered}} a militaristic church {{in that it was}} planned as a ‘fortress church’ and <b>the</b> proof <b>of</b> this {{can be seen in the}} massive buttresses which support <b>the</b> front and <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church. The church was built to replace churches that had been destroyed by an earthquake in 1612 and subsequent churches that had been destroyed by fires.|$|R

5|$|Cave 13 on a {{slightly}} higher level than cave 12, is a small dwelling with an open court and from 2 steps lead to a veranda. To {{the right of the}} court is a cistern. The veranda has a bench along its right wall. The front of the veranda has 2 benches, flanked by a plain eight-sided pillar and pilaster; some remnants of these survive. On the right pilaster is a double crescent ornament. A grooved door leads to a middle room, which has a bench along the right wall and seat recess to the left. A window is to the left of door. In the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle room a cell (left) - with a grooved bench and a bench - and a half cell (right) are seen. The ceiling has traces of painting.|$|E
5|$|The <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room, {{which is}} in shadow, is hung with rows of paintings, {{including}} {{one of a series}} of scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses by Peter Paul Rubens, and copies, by Velázquez's son-in-law and principal assistant Juan del Mazo, of works by Jacob Jordaens. The paintings are shown in the exact positions recorded in an inventory taken around this time. The wall to the right is hung with a grid of eight smaller paintings, visible mainly as frames owing to their angle from the viewer. They can be identified from the inventory as more Mazo copies of paintings from the Rubens Ovid series, though only two of the subjects can be seen.|$|E
5|$|The Capitoline Temple {{stands behind}} the {{basilica}} within what would originally {{have been an}} arcaded courtyard. An altar stands in the courtyard in front of 13 steps {{leading up to the}} Corinthian-columned temple, which had a single cella. The building was of great importance to civic life as it was dedicated to the three chief divinities of the Roman state, Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. Civic assemblies were held in front of the temple to beseech the aid of the gods or to thank them for successes in major civic undertakings such as fighting wars. The layout of the temple, facing the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basilica, is somewhat unusual and {{it has been suggested that}} it may have been built on top of an existing shrine. An inscription found in 1924 records that it was reconstructed in 218. It was partly restored in 1955 and given a more substantial restoration in 1962, reconstructing 10 of the 13 steps, the walls of the cella and the columns. There were four more small shrines within the temple precinct, one of which was dedicated to Venus.|$|E
25|$|Dating to the mid-4th century BCE, the stoa {{measured}} 11 by 110m with 39 exterior Doric {{columns and}} 17 internal Ionic columns.

50|$|The {{acoustics}} {{were designed}} by Bob Essert of Sound Space Design and a team that included Aercoustics Engineering, Wilson Ihrig & Associates and Engineering Harmonics. <b>The</b> undulating <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> venue, which diffuse the sound throughout the auditorium by reflecting the sound waves back to the stage, account for about 90 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> audible sound for the audience. To prevent audience members from detecting specific sounds and vibrations including traffic noise, the rumble from the adjacent subway line and streetcar line, and even <b>the</b> sirens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emergency vehicles rushing to the nearby hospitals, the theatre sits on 489 rubber insulating pads.|$|R
25|$|Later {{additions}} to the church include toilets, built against the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church, and a brick columbarium wall near the entrance, both added in 1995. A rectory, which stood behind the church, was sold and removed in early 2004, and a recent steel building has been constructed in its place. The original timber church has also been demolished. St Paul's continues to function as the main church for the Parish of Proserpine.|$|E

25|$|Since their {{introduction}} in the mid-1980s, in-ear monitors {{have grown}} {{to be the most}} popular monitoring choice for large touring acts. The reduction or elimination of loudspeakers other than instrument amplifiers on stage has allowed for cleaner and less problematic mixing situations for both the front of house and monitor engineers. Audio feedback is greatly reduced and there is less sound reflecting off the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stage out into the audience, which affects the clarity of the mix the front of house engineer is attempting to create.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{backscattering}} from partially water-filled cylindrical shells {{has been}} studied using finite element (FE) analysis and experimental measurements for low to medium frequencies, corresponding to 2 < ka < 30 (where a is the shell outer radius). For a partially-filled shell, filled to three quarters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner diameter, backscattering has been investigated numerically as a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elevation angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident wave, and in particular as the wave direction changes from horizontal to vertical. Comparisons with fully air-filled and fully water-filled shells indicate that the shell resembles the former when the wave is incident from above and the latter when the wave is incident horizontally. The experiments were performed in a reservoir, using horizontal incidence and wideband Ricker pulses generated by a parametric array. <b>The</b> short duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ricker pulses {{made it possible to}} observe a number <b>of</b> returns after <b>the</b> specular return for a shell with a high filling fraction; these included contributions due to S 0 waves generated at <b>the</b> front and <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shell, and <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> return. Inversion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FE model data enabled the expected waveforms to be predicted; the measurements were in very good agreement with the predictions...|$|R
25|$|The vaginal {{plate is}} the {{precursor}} to the vagina. During development, the vaginal plate begins to grow where the solid ends of the paramesonephric ducts (Müllerian ducts) enter the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> urogenital sinus. As the plate grows, it separates the sinus into the urethra and the vagina and extends the vagina by pushing the cervix deeper. Originally full of cells, as the central cells of the plate break down, the lumen of the vagina is formed. This usually occurs by the twenty to twenty-fourth week of development. If the lumen does not form, or is incomplete, membranes across or around the tract called septae can form, which may cause obstruction of the outflow tract later in life.|$|E
25|$|The film {{features}} two {{allusions to}} Alfred Hitchcock's film Vertigo. Like that film, it features recurring images of spirals, {{such as the}} 'Spirale' Cafe behind Manni's phone box and the spiral staircase down which Lola runs. In addition, the painting on the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> casino of a woman's head seen from behind {{is based on a}} shot in Vertigo: Tykwer disliked the empty space on the wall behind the roulette table and commissioned production designer Alexander Manasse to paint a picture of Kim Novak as she appeared in Vertigo. Manasse could not remember what she looked like in the film; therefore, he decided to paint the famous shot of the back of her head. The painting took fifteen minutes to complete. The bed sheets in the red scenes also feature spiral designs which add to the allusion.|$|E
25|$|These {{buildings}} were semi-circular and possessed certain inherent architectural structures, with minor differences {{depending on the}} region {{in which they were}} constructed. The scaenae frons was a high <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stage floor, supported by columns. The proscaenium was a wall that supported the front edge of the stage with ornately decorated niches off to the sides. The Hellenistic influence is seen through the use of the proscaenium. The Roman theatre also had a podium, which sometimes supported the columns of the scaenae frons. The scaenae was originally not part of the building itself, constructed only to provide sufficient background for the actors. Eventually, it became a part of the edifice itself, made out of concrete. The theatre itself was divided into the stage (orchestra) and the seating section (auditorium). Vomitoria or entrances and exits were made available to the audience.|$|E

50|$|Common {{criticism}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gym, including by students, is its age and size. It is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smaller gyms in the West Coast Conference. The seating {{is mainly}} along two sides, running along <b>the</b> long sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court. Behind one basket {{is a large}} wall, and behind another a handful of elevated, VIP seats. Seating is mostly bleacher-style, not stadium style. However, many feel that <b>the</b> small size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gym adds to <b>the</b> intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crowd at sold-out games, when <b>the</b> cheers <b>of</b> 3,500 fans are amplified due to the small space. Because of this, McKeon Pavilion {{is considered by many}} to be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tougher gyms to play in for an opposing team. Current athletic director Mark Orr has said there are design plans that would knock out <b>the</b> front and <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gym, adding 1,000 seats, but there is not yet funding for the project.|$|R
40|$|Hydrodynamic {{simulations}} of a pseudo- 2 D bubbling fluidized bed {{were carried out}} and compared to experiments conducted {{over a wide range}} <b>of</b> flow conditions. <b>The</b> primary purpose <b>of</b> this study was to assess <b>the</b> generality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> standard 2 D Two Fluid Model (TFM) closed by <b>the</b> Kinetic Theory <b>of</b> Granular Flows (KTGF) which is regularly used in the literature to simulate bubbling fluidized beds. Comparisons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bed expansion ratio over wide ranges of fluidization velocity, bed loading and particle size showed systematic differences between simulations and experiments, indicating that <b>the</b> generality <b>of</b> this modelling approach is questionable. More detailed flow velocity measurements collected via Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) showed that the model greatly over-predicts flow velocities in the bed.
