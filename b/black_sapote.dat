5000|$|Diospyros nigra [...] - <b>Black</b> <b>sapote,</b> Chocolate pudding fruit, [...] "Black persimmon" ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Black</b> <b>sapote</b> (Diospyros nigra), {{from eastern}} Mexico south to Colombia, is {{probably}} the original Aztec tzapotl.|$|E
50|$|Diospyros nigra, the <b>black</b> <b>sapote,</b> is {{a species}} of persimmon. Common names include {{chocolate}} pudding fruit, chocolate persimmon and (in Spanish) zapote prieto.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} elevations are Piedra Redonda, Chivaguia Grande, Chivaguia Chica, Guinise Grande, Loma del Cuche, La Peñas and Guibetes. The Atoyac and Valiente Rivers pass through here. The municipality has a temperate climate with winds {{mostly from the}} north. Agriculture employ about 19% of the population growing vegetables such as corn, beans and squash blossom, as well as decorative flowers such as daisies, Mexican marigolds and poinsettias. Orchards here produce oranges, mangos, mamey <b>sapotes,</b> <b>black</b> <b>sapotes,</b> guavas and other tropical fruit. Livestock includes domestic fowl, pigs, cattle and sheep. About 33% are involved in mining and industry, with most of this population dedicated to the making of barro negro pottery. The rest of the population, about 45% is employed in commerce.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} {{economic activities}} are agriculture, {{the raising of}} cattle and in some areas, fishing. The coastal areas mostly produce corn with two harvests per year along with beans, chili peppers, oranges, limes, grapefruit, mandarin oranges, sugar cane, bananas, vanilla, sesame seed and more. The mountain areas principally grow coffee, <b>black</b> pepper, <b>sapote</b> and mamey. Much of the citrus fruit is exported. Aside from cattle there is some other livestock such as pigs, sheep, horses and domestic fowl as well as bees.|$|R
50|$|Black {{persimmon}} or <b>black</b> <b>sapote</b> (Diospyros digyna) is {{native to}} Mexico. Its fruit has green skin and white flesh that turns black when ripe.|$|E
5000|$|Tropical Fruit Orchard - {{includes}} mango, citrus, lychee, <b>black</b> <b>sapote,</b> papaw, breadfruit, miracle fruit, dates, cashews, jackfruit, palm hearts, cinnamon, cloves, coffee,tea, turmeric and ginger.|$|E
50|$|The mamey sapote {{is related}} to other sapotes such as {{sapodilla}} (Manilkara zapota), abiu (P. caimito) and canistel (P. campechiana), but unrelated to the <b>black</b> <b>sapote</b> (Diospyros digyna) and white sapote (Casimiroa edulis).|$|E
50|$|A general {{common name}} for plants {{of the genus}} is sapote. Not all sapotes are members of this genus or even family, however; many sapotes are in the family Sapotaceae, {{especially}} the genus Pouteria, and the <b>black</b> <b>sapote</b> {{is part of the}} Ebenaceae.|$|E
50|$|The garden {{contains}} some 2000 varieties of plants, {{including more than}} 160 varieties of fruit trees, with 40 types of citrus, and 35 types of banana and plantain trees. It also includes orchids, bromeliads, palms, and ferns, as well as less well-known plants such as jaboticaba, <b>black</b> <b>sapote,</b> jackfruit, and carambola trees.|$|E
50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>sapote</b> {{trees are}} {{normally}} found below 600 meters, {{but are not}} particular about soil, and can tolerate light frosts. They are sensitive to drought, requiring irrigation in dry areas, but are quite tolerant of flooding. The tree grows fairly slowly for the first 3-4 years, perhaps just 1 foot/year {{for the first couple}} of years. Later however it grows much more rapidly. Trees should be spaced 10-12m apart.|$|E
50|$|With its {{tropical}} climate, many {{tropical fruit}} crops are grown in Redland that cannot be grown commercially {{elsewhere in the}} United States but South Florida, such as mango, avocado, guava, passion fruit, lychee, jack fruit, canistel, sapodilla, longan, mamey sapote, <b>black</b> <b>sapote</b> ("chocolate pudding fruit"), miracle fruit, jaboticaba, cecropia ("snake fingers") and coffee beans, {{all of which can}} be sampled for free at the Fruit and Spice Park, a local attraction.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the mamey sapote, {{white sapote}} {{is a member}} of the family Rutaceae, to which citrus belongs. The <b>black</b> <b>sapote</b> is also {{unrelated}} and is actually a species of persimmon. This confusion may be because [...] "sapote" [...] comes from the Nahuatl (Aztec) word tzapotl, used to describe all soft, sweet fruit. Commonly grown in Northern New South Wales, Australia, and often mistaken for a persimmon, although these two fruits are unrelated.|$|E
50|$|As for {{vegetation}} grown {{there is}} the presence of flower is like lily, gladiola, hydrangea, tulip, bougainvillea, geranium, alcatraz and aretillo. Not to mention the vegetables and fruit trees {{that are part of the}} vegetation community as maize, smells at night, popuchu, quintoniles, squash, mustard, chard, orange, banana, sweet lemon, <b>black</b> <b>sapote,</b> sapodilla, avocado, loquat, tangerine, peach and coffee for this crop is usually managed under shade (trees that used for shade are: banana, orange and cedar).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Black</b> <b>sapote</b> fruit are tomato-like {{and measure}} 5 - 10 cm in diameter, with an {{inedible}} skin that turns from olive {{to a deep}} yellow-green when ripe and a pulp which is white and inedible when unripe but assumes a flavor, color and texture often likened to chocolate pudding when ripe. Fruits usually contain seeds, up {{to a maximum of}} 12. The texture has been likened to that of a papaya. Boning (2006), describes the ripe fruit as having [...] "the taste and consistency of chocolate pudding." ...|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{vegetation}} is low- and medium-altitude rain forest, whose trees often lose their {{leaves in the}} late fall. At the highest elevations, there are forests of pine and holm oak. Wildlife include deer, iguanas, rabbits, armadillos, tejon, raccoons, opossums, skunks, wild cats, buzzards, various types of parrots and other birds.

Visitors are free to sample fruits lying on the ground, but are not allowed to pick anything from the trees. Fruits that may be poisonous if not consumed correctly, such as ackee, are fenced for safety. The park has completed many renovations and separates the plants into Caribbean, African and Asian sections.|$|E
50|$|The {{municipality}} covers {{an area of}} 933.9 km² at {{an altitude}} of 120 meters above sea level.

5000|$|An early {{name for}} the area was Zapotitlán, {{referring}} to {{the large number of}} <b>black</b> <b>sapote</b> trees that were in the area; however, these trees are rare today. The current name is derived from the Nahuatl [...] "Tilcaxitl" [...] which means either “black earth depression or bowl” or “mountain of cochineal ink.” The first would refer to a dark fresh water spring, which today is located between Calle de Cajete and Avenida Progreso. The latter meaning would refer to the fact that in antiquity, residents here were known for making ink and dye from the cochineal insect. Another possible origin for the name comes from “tilmas” which is a traditional type of apron worn by workmen to protect clothes underneath and to carry things. Today tilmas are most often seen as part of the costume worn for the Danza de la Pluma. The prefix of San Martin was added in honor of the bishop of Tours, France.|$|E
50|$|Moist {{forests are}} {{classified}} as being either lowland mesic, montane mesic, lowland wet, or montane wet. Characteristic lowland species are Haitian catalpa (Catalpa longissima), particularly in well-drained soils, and West Indian mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni). Puerto Rican royal palm (Roystonea borinquena) is common where soil is calcareous. Paradise tree (Simarouba glauca), anón de majagua (Lonchocarpus heptaphyllus), jagua (Genipa americana), black olive (Bucida buceras), West Indian lancewood (Oxandra lanceolata) and amacey (Tetragastris balsamifera) are found in small secondary stands. Isolated trees are home to fustic (Maclura tinctoria), logwood (Haematoxylum campechianum), iris (Hippeastrum puniceum), caracolí (Abarema glauca), córbano (Albizia berteriana), West Indian elm (Guazuma ulmifolia), palo de leche (Rauvolfia nitida), and spiny fiddlewood (Citharexylum spinosum). Areas where soils are superficial or savannas have formed from degraded forest are indicated by trees such as the sandpaper tree (Curatella americana), grandleaf seagrape (Coccoloba pubescens), Jamaican nettletree (Trema micrantha) and Tabebuia species. Cashews (Anacardium occidentale) are present in zones that have marginal earth and precipitation closer {{to that of the}} dry forests. Yellow olivier (Buchenavia capitata), sablito (Schefflera morototoni), maricao (Byrsonima spicata) aguacatillo (Alchornea latifolia), West Indian cherry (Prunus myrtifolia), árbol de Santa Maria (Calophyllum brasiliense), cocuyo (Hirtella triandra), American muskwood (Guarea guidonia), palo de yagua (Casearia arborea), locust (Hymenaea courbaril), balatá (Manilkara domingensis) and sierra palm (Prestoea montana) grow in mesic forests. Hispaniolan pine (Pinus occidentalis) is common on lateritic soils. Wet forests consist of trees covered by parasitic plants and epiphytes. The principal indicator species include tree ferns (Cyathea spp.) and Chionanthus species. At higher elevations, characteristic species are the trembling schefflera (Schefflera tremula), <b>black</b> <b>sapote</b> (Diospyros digyna), almendrón (Prunus occidentalis), Fadyen's silktassel (Garrya fadyenii), Weinmannia pinnata, Oreopanax capitatus, Brunellia comocladifolia, Hispaniolan pines, and Cyathea species.|$|E

40|$|Aiming to {{evaluate}} seedling emergence of <b>black</b> <b>sapote</b> (Diospyros ebenaster Retz.) {{it was developed}} an experiment with seeds, collected on mature fruits, proceeding from Germoplasm Bank of Horticulture Department, University of São Paulo State, Jaboticabal, Brazil. Immediately after extracted, the seeds were washed, dried in paper and put in plastic box filled with the substrate studied, thus characterizing four treatments, as follows: Plantmaxâ; Coconut fiberâ; Sand; Soil mix [soil + sand + bovine manure (3 : 3 : 1) ]. It was observed emergence percentage (E%) and rate of emergence speed (RES). The different substrates had statisticalinfluence on variable studied. The highest E% was obtained on soil mix, Plantmaxâ and Coconut fiberâ substrates and the best RES was observed on soil mix and Plantmax? substrates...|$|E
40|$|The {{volatile}} compounds of <b>black</b> <b>sapote</b> fruit {{were isolated}} by simultaneous distillation-solvent extraction and analysed by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 32 volatile constituents were detected, which represented 4. 57 mg kg − 1 {{of the fruit}}. The composition of volatile constituents of the fruit included 9 terpene compounds (49. 1 % of the total volatile composition), 11 ketones (9 %), 5 aldehydes (29. 2 %), 4 alcohols (3. 6 %), 2 esters (8. 2 %) and a paraffin (0. 8 %). Major compounds were (Z) -b-ocimene (26. 6 % of the total volatile composition), (E) -cinnamaldehyde (25. 5 %) and limonene (17. 0 %). By application of odour activity values, seven constituents were considered as aroma-active volatiles, from which the most important were (E) -cinnamaldehyde, 3 -methylbutanal, limonene, (Z) -β-ocimene, linalool, methyl (E) -cinnamate, and β-caryophyllene...|$|E
40|$|Seedlings {{of three}} {{commercial}} native tree species were planted under heterogeneous light and nutrient conditions in primary rainforest, secondary forest, and open pasture in Los Tuxtlas (Veracruz, Mexico). Management consisted of weeding around seedlings, and watering {{during the dry}} period. The objective was to find those natural growth conditions that maximize height growth in the first 2 years after transplantation from a nursery. Using stepwise multiple linear regression, the combined effect of varying canopy openness, leaf nutrients, initial seedling height, and seed mass on the plant height {{at the end of}} the study were analysed. The effect of the light environment differed clearly between species: the fruit species Pouteria sapota (Jacquin) H. E. Moore & Stearn (Mamey) and Diospyros digyna Jacquin (<b>Black</b> <b>Sapote)</b> revealed an optimal canopy openness of 60 and 55 %, respectively, while the timber species Cedrela odorata Linnaeus (Spanish Cedar) grew best under maximum openness. Consequently, P. sapota and D. digyna are recommendable for an enrichment or shelterwood system in the forest, while C. odorata is recommendable as a reforestation species in the open. For P. sapota and D. digyna, plant height variation {{at the end of the}} study was also explained by the leaf zinc concentration, initial plant height, and in P. sapota by the seed mass and lea...|$|E
