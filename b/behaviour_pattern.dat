50|$|The {{handicap}} principle gains {{further support}} by providing interpretations for behaviours that {{fit into a}} single unifying gene-centered view of evolution and making earlier explanations based on group selection obsolete. A classic example is that of stotting in gazelles. This behaviour consists in the gazelle initially running slowly and jumping high when threatened by a predator such as a lion or cheetah. The explanation based on group selection was that such behaviour might be adapted to alerting other gazelle to a cheetah's presence or might {{be part of a}} collective <b>behaviour</b> <b>pattern</b> of the group of gazelle to confuse the cheetah. Instead, Zahavi proposed that each gazelle was communicating that it was a fitter individual than its fellows. This may communicate to the cheetah to avoid chasing this fitter individual, or the message may be oriented toward the other gazelles, which would indicate its fitness to potential mates.|$|E

5000|$|Abnormal {{behaviour}} {{of birds}} in captivity {{can be defined}} in several ways. [...] Statistically, 'abnormal' is when the occurrence, frequency or intensity of a behaviour varies statistically significantly, either more or less, from the normal value. This means that theoretically, almost any behaviour could become 'abnormal' in an individual. Less formally, 'abnormal' includes any activity judged to be outside the normal <b>behaviour</b> <b>pattern</b> for captive birds of that particular class or age. For example, running rather than flying may be a normal behaviour and regularly observed in one species, however, in another species it might be normal but becomes 'abnormal' if it reaches a high frequency, or in another species it is rarely observed and any incidence is considered 'abnormal'. This article does not include 'one-off' behaviours performed by individual birds that might be considered abnormal for that individual, unless these are performed repeatedly by other individuals in the species and are recognised {{as part of the}} ethogram of that species.|$|E
50|$|Lemon tetras exhibit an {{interesting}} <b>behaviour</b> <b>pattern</b> in the aquarium, replicated by several other characin species, in which males will adopt 'landmarks' within the aquarium and use these as places {{from which to}} display as maturity approaches. Displays are principally performed between rival males, which position themselves in a slightly head-up posture, unpaired fins held erect to appear as large and as imposing as possible, and swim forwards with 'flicking' movements of the body. If two rival males approach closely, they will then begin to make passes at each other, which to the causal observer look like attacks: this is an entirely ritualised behaviour, best referred to as 'jousting', where the males make darting movements toward each other but pull away at the last moment. No damage is incurred by either contestant in these events, and evenly matched males that are at a similar level in the social hierarchy will continue such behaviour for 30 minutes or more at a time. This behaviour serves not only to establish the social rankings of the males, but also serves {{as an indicator of}} reproductive fitness to the watching females.|$|E
5000|$|The key {{discovery}} in the {{revision of the}} case histories was that Eric Cooke had been a multiple-method killer. His offences show a significant deviation from the pattern generally accepted as the orthodox [...] "serial killer" [...] template, which holds that such killers target {{the same type of}} victim in the same way, impelled by the same underlying motive. Cooke, conversely, for differing reasons, using various methods, killed or attempted to kill persons of both sexes and of a wide spread of ages and social circumstances.Blackburn discovered, once granted access to police archives, that the police had not emphasised this <b>behaviour</b> <b>pattern</b> of Cooke in their public statements. They made no public announcement that Cooke had attacked seven other women in five hit-runs and five other women asleep in their beds, women who survived the attacks. So the Western Australian community at large and the legal advocates for Button and Beamish were unaware that Cooke had attempted murder by vehicle impact. This was the means by which John Button's girlfriend, 17-year-old Rosemary Anderson, had been killed. At the time of Button's trial for her wilful murder, her death appeared to be an isolated event and his claim that he had coincidentally discovered her after the attack seemed implausible. Likewise, during Darryl Beamish's trial for the wilful murder of 22-year-old heiress Jillian Brewer (who was attacked while she slept), the offence was not placed {{in the context of the}} series of assaults that Cooke had committed against other women asleep in their homes.|$|E

5000|$|This {{psychotherapy}} is time limited, {{the maximum}} number of sessions is 30. The therapy is focussed in that the therapist concentrates on one theme and discusses this theme with the patient before the therapy begins. The focus can be a superficial conflict or a conflict that is deeply embedded in the patient’s life. The therapy has the best results if the conflict that is chosen is related to the central conflict from the patient’s childhood. The therapist takes an active role during the therapy. He sees to it that the focus is the central theme in each session. Anything outside the focus is neglected, anything related to the focus is given attention to. The therapist makes use of resistance, transference, countertransference and interpretation and uses the Malan triangles (see picture). These triangles are a picture {{of the structure of the}} patient’s conflict and of the persons related to that conflict. The patient defends (defence mechanism) against the hidden feeling, expression of which to others in the present or to the parent in the past (origin of the conflict) is unacceptable and cause for anxiety. Both triangles stand on its apex. In the Triangle of Conflict (first used by Henry Ezriel [...] ) this means that the hidden feeling/impulse lies under the defence and the anxiety. In the Triangle of Persons (developed by Menninger [...] ) that what happened in the relation to the Parent lies under and is prior to what happens in relationship to Others or to the Therapist (transference). Malan linked both triangles: the hidden feeling is related to one or more categories of the Triangle of Persons. Nearly every intervention of the therapist is reflected in the triangles. The therapist needs to realise at every moment in the therapy which area of which triangle is at stake. The aim of the therapy is to give the patient insight into his <b>behaviour</b> <b>pattern</b> by working through the defence, bringing the hidden feeling/impulse into awareness, making clear how these have impacted the relationship of the patient with others in the present, with his parents in the past. Contra-indications for this therapy are very impulsive or self-destructive behaviour, serious attempts at suicide, long period of hospitalisation, electroshocks treatments, strong phobic or obsessive complaints (from a non-published list made by H.P.Hildebrand).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Many {{species have}} a {{repertoire}} of <b>behaviour</b> <b>patterns</b> {{that are used in}} contests over resources. It is likely that the function of these <b>behaviour</b> <b>patterns</b> is the assessment of asymmetries between con-testants in physical variables (e. g. size or strength). Theoretical models of fighting behaviour such as the war of attrition and the hawk-dove game do not incorporate any behavioural mechanisms allowing assessment, and, therefore, yield no predictions about the use of <b>behaviour</b> <b>patterns.</b> In a sequential assessment game, on the other hand, the assessment of asymmetries is a major activity during a fight. Recently, a version of the sequential ssessment game with several behavioural options has been devel-oped, and here predictions from this model are tested using data from 102 staged fights between males of the cichlid fish Nannacara nomala. The model predicts that the sequence of <b>behaviour</b> <b>patterns</b> in a fight should be maximally efficient in assessing relative fighting ability. Specific predictions are that (1) the sequence should be organized into phases consisting of one or several <b>behaviour</b> <b>patterns</b> with constant rates of behaviour within a phase, (2) the division into phases hould be independent of relative fighting ability, and (3) contests with great asymmetry in relative fighting ability should end in an early phase, whereas matched individuals may proceed through a series of escalations reaching a final phase of more dangerous fighting. The results how that the fighting behaviour of N. anomala is rather well predicted b...|$|R

A novel framework is developed for automatic behaviour profiling and online anomaly sampling/detection without any manual labelling of the training dataset.

The similarity between <b>behaviour</b> <b>patterns</b> are measured based on modelling each pattern using a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN). (2) Natural grouping of <b>behaviour</b> <b>patterns</b> is discovered through a novel spectral clustering algorithm with unsupervised model selection and feature selection on the eigenvectors of a normalised affinity matrix.
