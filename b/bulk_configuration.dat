The enigmatic <b>bulk</b> <b>configurations,</b> considered within the STU model, can be mapped under spectral flow into black rings with three monopole and dipole charges. Even though the <b>bulk</b> and CFT <b>configurations</b> {{existed in the}} same region of parameter space, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the <b>bulk</b> <b>configurations</b> {{was found to be}} lower than the microscopic entropy from the CFT.

New families of BPS black ring solutions with four electric and four dipole magnetic charges have recently been explicitly constructed in [2]. These black rings are not embeddable within the STU model. In this paper we investigate if these black rings can be entropically dominant over the STU model black rings. We find that the new black rings are always entropically subdominant to the STU-model black rings. However, for small fourth dipole charge these black rings continue to be dominant over the BMPV in a small region of parameters and are thus enigmatic...|$|R

While the WGS activity appears to be ruled especially by the Cu/Ce surface to volume ratio, the CO-PrOx reaction is governed by the CuO loading.

40|$|We find {{a family}} of novel supersymmetric phases of the D 1 -D 5 CFT, which in certain ranges of charges have more entropy than all known ensembles. We also find <b>bulk</b> BPS <b>configurations</b> {{that exist in the}} same range of {{parameters}} as these phases, and have more entropy than a BMPV black hole; they {{can be thought of as}} coming from a BMPV black hole shedding a "hair" condensate outside of the horizon. The entropy of the <b>bulk</b> <b>configurations</b> is smaller than that of the CFT phases, which indicates that some of the CFT states are lifted at strong coupling. Neither the bulk nor the boundary phases are captured by the elliptic genus, which makes the coincidence of the phase boundaries particularly remarkable. Our configurations are supersymmetric, have non-Cardy-like entropy, and are the first instance of a black hole entropy enigma with a controlled CFT dual. Furthermore, contrary to common lore, these objects exist in a region of parameter space (between the "cosmic censorship bound" and the "unitarity bound") where no black holes were thought to exist.

The <b>bulk</b> <b>configuration</b> is solved for given boundary metrics, and it is substituted back into the action to obtain the effective four-dimensional action. In order to obtain the ghost-free bigravity, we consider the gradient expansion in which the brane separation is supposed to be sufficiently small so that two boundary metrics are almost identical. The obtained effective theory is shown to be ghost free as expected, however, the interaction between two gravitons takes the Fierz-Pauli form at the leading order of the gradient expansion, even though we do not use the approximation of linear perturbation. We also find that the radion remains as a scalar field in the four-dimensional effective theory, but its coupling to the metrics is non-trivial. Comment: 16 page...|$|E

40|$|Nano-crystallize {{materials}} {{have been known}} for decades to potentially owe the novel self-healing ability for radiation damage, which has been demonstrated to be especially linked to preferential occupation of interstitials at grain boundary (GB) and promoted vacancy-interstitial annihilation. A major obstacle to better understanding the healing property {{is the lack of}} an atomistic picture of the interstitial states near GBs, due to severely separation of the timescale of interstitial segregation from other events and abundance of interstitials at the GB. Here, we report a generic "self-blocking" effect of the interstitial cluster (SIAn) near the metallic GB in W, Mo and Fe. Upon creating a SIAn near the GB, it is immediately trapped by the GB during the GB structural relaxation and blocks there, impeding GB's further spontaneous trapping of the SIAn in the vicinity and making these SIAns stuck nearby the GB. The SIAn in the stuck state surprisingly owes an exceptionally larger number of annihilation sites with vacancies near the GB than the SIAn trapped at the GB due to maintaining its <b>bulk</b> <b>configuration</b> basically. Besides, it also has an unexpectedly long-ranged repelling interaction with the SIA in the bulk region, which may further affect the GB's trap of the SIAn. The self-blocking effect might shed light on more critical and extended role of the GB in healing radiation-damage in NCs than previously recognized the GB's limited role based on GB's trap for the SIA and resulted vacancy-SIA recombination.
