5000|$|During filming on 8 July 1965, Mantz {{tried to}} {{simulate}} a takeoff {{by making a}} [...] "touch-and-go". As Mantz came in for another low camera pass, his rate of descent at 90 mph exceeded the plane's structural capacity. The modest impact of the touchdown, coupled with the sudden drag caused by the aircraft's cobbled skid/wheel landing gear, caused the <b>boom</b> <b>section</b> behind the wings to fail, propelling the nose section forward, with the P-1 breaking up violently, killing Paul Mantz instantly. Stuntman Billy Rose, also on board, was thrown clear and survived with a broken shoulder and pelvis. It should be noted the tail boom cracked just aft of the wing as the right skid hit the ground while the left skid and tail wheel {{were still in the}} air. Note the rising dust only from the right skid and the boom was half way cracked through. Refer to photo #6 from http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/Mantz-P1.htm.|$|E

This patent was {{assigned}} to J. C. Bamford Excavators Limited, Staffordshire (GB) A boom for a load handling machine, the boom has a mounting by which the boom is mounted on a body of the machine, and at least first and second telescoped sections. In use, the boom carries a load handling implement at or towards its outermost end. The first <b>boom</b> <b>section</b> is telescoped within the second section and is extendible and retractable relative to the second <b>boom</b> <b>section</b> by an actuator. At least the first <b>boom</b> <b>section</b> includes walls made at least predominantly of a composite material.

40|$|The {{application}} of pre-emergence, post-emergence, and burn-down herbicides (i. e., glyphosate) {{continues to increase}} as producers attempt to reduce both negative environmental impacts from tillage and input costs from labor, machinery and materials. The use of precision agriculture technologies such as automatic <b>boom</b> <b>section</b> control allows producers to reduce off-target application when applying herbicides. While automatic <b>boom</b> <b>section</b> control provides benefits, pressure differences across the spray boom resulting from <b>boom</b> <b>section</b> actuation can lead to off-rate application errors. Off-rate errors may also result from spray rate controller compensation for ground speed changes and velocity variation across the spray boom during turning movements. This project focuses on quantifying accumulated pesticide application for three fields located in Central Kentucky. GPS coordinates were collected along with nozzle pressure data (at 13 nozzle locations) at one second intervals as the sprayer traversed the study fields. The method previously developed by Luck et al. (2009) was used to calculate coverage areas for the control sections along the spray boom in MS Excel. Nozzle discharge flow rates were estimated from the nozzle pressure data (based on manufacturer calibration information) which was then incorporated into MS Excel to determine the rate of pesticide applied to the fields. Results indicate the majority of each field received application rates at or below the target rate. Only 34. 2 %, 33. 9 %, and 22. 9 % of Fields 1, 2, and 4, respectively, received application rates at the target rate +/- 10 % during these postemergence treatments. The goal of this project was develop distribution maps {{to better understand the}} effects of <b>boom</b> <b>section</b> control and turning movements on herbicide accumulation...|$|E

Models were 65, 75, or 85 foot models using three <b>boom</b> <b>sections.</b> Ground ladders were stored {{in the rear of}} the vehicle plus additional ladders on one or both sides of the body above compartments. The later addition of a 100-foot model used four <b>boom</b> <b>sections</b> and even later the Magnum 110 foot model used five. The SPH-100 model was introduced in 2004 originally on the short-lived Imperial chassis with production on the Monarch chassis. This model uses five <b>boom</b> <b>sections</b> to reduce overall length and raised a much larger bucket/basket above the chassis body. All ground ladders are stored at the rear of the vehicle to increase compartment space.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{precision}} farming products continues to increase. With increasing input costs, producers are often {{looking for ways}} to adopt technology to make farming operations more efficient and productive. Two precision ag products, auto guidance and automatic section control, lead the way in cost savings while also enhancing the productivity of machinery operations. Guidance systems reduce overlap in fields which leads to less passes across the field, less fuel and product use (i. e. seed, fertilizer, and herbicide), and fewer operator hours. These savings can be directly calculated if the amount of overlap is known. Additionally, swath control products reduce seed and chemical overlap into headlands and field boundaries by automatically shutting off planter or <b>boom</b> <b>sections</b> as they cross into headland areas...|$|R

Spray rate controller lag time appeared to contribute to lower application rates as the sprayer accelerated and higher application rates as the sprayer decelerated as the controller attempted to compensate for changes in sprayer velocity. In addition, as boom control sections were turned off, pressure increases in the remaining sections resulted in higher application rates. Conversely, as boom sections were turned on, spray rate controller lag time may have contributed to lower application rates.

40|$|Most modern spray {{controllers}} when {{coupled with}} a {{differential global positioning system}} (DGPS) receiver can provide automatic section or swath (<b>boom</b> <b>section</b> or nozzle) control capabilities that minimize overlap and application into undesirable areas. This technology can improve application accuracy of pesticides and fertilizers, thereby reducing the number of inputs while promoting environmental stewardship. However, dynamic system response for sprayer boom operation, which includes cycling or using auto-swath technology, has not been investigated. Therefore, a study was conducted to develop a methodology and subsequently perform experiments to evaluate tip pressure and system flow variations on a typical agricultural sprayer equipped with a controller that provided both <b>boom</b> <b>section</b> and nozzle control. To quantify flow dynamics during <b>boom</b> <b>section</b> or nozzle control, a testing protocol was established that included three simulation patterns under both flow compensation and no-compensation modes achieved via the spray controller. Overall system flow rate and nozzle tip pressure at ten boom locations were recorded and analyzed to quantify pressure and flow variations. Results indicated that the test methodology generated sufficient data to analyze nozzle tip pressure and system flow rate changes. The tip pressure for the compensated section control tests varied between 6. 7 % and 20. 0 %, which equated to an increase of 3. 7 % to 10. 6 % in tip flow rate. The pressure stabilization time when turning boom sections and nozzles off approached 25. 2 s but only approached 15. 6 s when turning them back on for the flow compensation tests. Although extended periods were required for the tip pressure to stabilize, the system flow rate typically stabilized in less than 7 s. The tip flow rate was consistently higher (up to 10. 6 %) than the target flow rate, indicating that system flow did not truly represent tip flow during section control. The no-compensation tests exhibited tip pressure increases up to 35. 7 % during boom and nozzle control, which equated to an 18. 2 % increase in tip flow. Therefore, flow compensation over no-compensation had better control of tip flow rate. A consistent difference existed in dynamic pressure response between <b>boom</b> <b>section</b> and nozzle control. Increased tip pressure and delayed pressure stabilization times indicated that application variability can occur when manually turning sections on and off or implementing auto-swath technology, but further testing is needed to better understand the effect on application accuracy of agricultural sprayers...|$|E

40|$|Granular {{boom sprayer}} {{has been used}} by large scaled farmers for centuries. This machine is used to repel or {{fertilize}} their crops. In MARDI, they used 3 types of fertilizer that is Nitrogen, N, Phosphorus, P and Potassium, K. Those 3 types of particles have been simulated by using Ansys software and the results show that potassium, K fertilizer not scattered to the ground and the others 2 fertilizers are conversely. The uniformity of the distribution of granular fertilizer was carried out with a reasonable range of variables. Various methods have been used to study the efficiency of the spray boom design on through simulation software and lab approach. In this work, the simulation of the particles in the boom sprayer is performed from the boom sprayer entering until the exit and distributed to the ground. The simulation is performed by using ANSYS CFX based on the Taguchi method. Taguchi method have been used in this study. For the orthogonal array, since this case study consists of 4 level and 5 factor, Lâ 16 was used for the simulation process. This simulation utilize only one fertilizer that contained all types of the basic NPK fertilizer. The parameters are involved the granular diameter size, air velocity at the inlet, blow head distance, height of collecting plate and width of collecting plate. Results shows that the air velocity must be kept higher when the diameter of particle increases. Collecting plates with excessive height and width can cause the velocity fertilizer to drop and the particles fail to distribute well. Furthermore, furthers distance between the <b>boom</b> <b>section</b> can also cause the particles to scattered unevenly onto the ground. The most desired simulation result was achieved with 1. 5 mm diameter particles, air velocity 8 m/s, distance between <b>boom</b> <b>section</b> is 200 mm and height and width of collecting plate is 14 mm and 10 mm.

40|$|In {{agriculture}} {{crop protection}} products (CPP) are used to protect the crop against pests, diseases and weeds. Several sprayings of CPP are done per crop per season. The used amount of CPP per spraying is generally based on a pre set CPP dose. Most often fields with variations in crop development are treated uniformly while spraying some patches in these fields would have been sufficient. In {{order to deal with}} the variations in crop development and site-specific variations in a field, a sensor-based spray technology was developed; SensiSpray. The system consists of sensors to detect crop variation and a spray system to automatically change spray volume. Electronics and software were developed to use the output signal of the sensor to adapt spray volume. For the variation of spray volume Lechler VarioSelect nozzle bodies were used fitted with four different low-drift venturi flat fan nozzles. On a 27 m working width boom sprayer seven sensors were placed on each <b>boom</b> <b>section</b> to control spray volume per <b>boom</b> <b>section</b> of 3 - 4. 5 m wide. Spray deposition measurements were performed to test the sprayer accuracy in adapting spray volume based on the reflection signal per section, using a fluorescent dye (Brilliant Sulpho Flavine) added to the spray liquid.

40|$|Deciding which {{features}} to include on a sprayer {{in order to}} increase a purchaser 2 Ì 7 s likelihood of buying was a major problem for spray equipment manufacturers. There were several sprayer options that could be included or excluded that affect the retail price of the cotton sprayer. Conjoint analysis was utilized to determine the relative rank and value of features on a cotton sprayer. At the Georgia Cotton Commission Conference, ninety-five respondents completed a sorting of eight cards that each contained groupings of five cotton sprayer feature options. A demographics page was used to identify respondents that were farmer-buyers. The number of participants used in the study was fifty-six. The rankings from this study were entered into SPSS statistical software to retrieve utility values, importance values, and correlations. The analysis of the data showed that the inclusion of chlorophyll sensors had the largest influence on a purchaser 2 Ì 7 s decision to buy. Following this, in terms of importance was presence of wheel shields, type of wheel tread adjustment, and number of spray <b>boom</b> <b>sections.</b> The highest ranking feature combination was three chlorophyll sensors, the presence of shields, hydraulic tread adjustment, and two <b>boom</b> plumbing <b>sections.</b> Chlorophyll sensors were twice as important to respondents as all other features.

40|$|Future in-space {{construction}} and assembly facilities {{will require the}} use of space cranes capable of supporting and manipulating large and massive loads. The large size of the space components being considered for construction will require that these cranes have a reach on the order of 100 meters. A space crane constructed from an erectable four-longeron truss beam with 19 5 -sq-m truss bays is considered. This concept was selected to be compatible with the Space Station truss. This truss is hinged at three locations along its bottom edge and attached at one end to a rotary joint cantilevered to the assembly depot's main truss structure. The crane's <b>boom</b> <b>sections</b> are rotated by extensible longeron actuators located along the top edge of the beam. To achieve maximum position maneuvering capability for the crane requires that the individual sections be capable of rotating 180 degrees about the hinge point. This can only be accomplished by offsetting the hinges from the longeron axes. Since offset hinges introduce bending moments in the truss members, an analysis of the effect of hinge offsets on the load-carrying capacity of the structure is required. The objective of the static finite element analysis described is to determine the effect of various offset lengths on the overall bending stiffness of the crane and on the maximum stresses...|$|R

The trials were carried out on tomato crops cultivated in fields of different shapes in a farm located in the Poâ Valley (Piacenza), using a self-propelled sprayer with a capacity of 1000 L and a 14 m opening boom, with a three-channel direct injection distribution system. The self-propelled sprayer was equipped with an automatic guidance system and integrated nozzle control on each <b>boom</b> <b>section.</b> Several parameters were recorded including the speed (km/h) and treated surface (ha). The analysis of the data collected shows an average overlap reduction of 15 % compared to conventional guidance, a value that increases with the irregularity of the field.

40|$|Assessment of {{injection}} lag transport and uniformity of direct injection boom sprayer {{is an important}} issue for successful variable rate spraying technology. To estimate the boom lag transport and pressure loss, a numerical model is formulated on the basis of fluid hydrodynamic conservation equations. The software is implemented in visual basic. To solve the pressure â velocities equations, control volume finite element method (CV) is used to delimit elementary volumes of the boom. Linearization of the conservation laws is ensured by considering discrete form of the equations and calculating velocity and pressure step by step throughout the whole boom. The flow behaviour is simulated into a <b>boom</b> <b>section</b> divided into N elementary volumes, each of them including one nozzle. To test the model, three boom diameters (5, 6 and 8 mm) and two chemical viscosities (10 - 6 and 10 - 5 m 2 /s) were used. Experimental trials are carried out on boom having 2. 5 m length (5 nozzles) for measuring pressure gradient and lag transport.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references: p. 78. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The spill of oil in the oceans of the world is a major concern for the offshore industry. With the recent spurt in awareness towards the environment, efforts are being made to control the spread of oil spills. One such mechanism used to control the spread of spilt oil is the containment boom. Oil is confined to a limited area {{with the help of a}} boom and then removed with the help of skimmers or other devices which can absorb oil. Surprisingly, not much work has been done in this field towards standardization of guidelines for deploying booms. Identifying the seriousness of this problem, a study of the sea-keeping performance of the boom was made by model testing. Experiments were performed in two stages with a 1 : 4 scale rigid model of a <b>boom</b> <b>section</b> and a 1 : 4 scale flexible model of a continuous boom respectively. The models were tested for varying boom parameters like buoyancy to weight ratio, mass distribution, skirt depth, gap ratio and mooring position. To understand the relationship between the different parameters, the booms were tested in different environments with regular, random and short-crested waves and different currents selectively. The motion of the boom, wave elevation, wave run-up and the mooring forces were measured using optical tracking systems, accelerometers, capacitance probes and load cells. Boom performance criteria were defined assuming that drainage and oversplash failures are the primary modes of failure. Results from the experiments were compared with predictions from a numerical code built using Boundary Element Method. Using these results, a guideline for the optimum design and selection of future booms was developed...|$|E

40|$|In This Issue: HERBICIDE APPLICATION Weed {{control with}} {{herbicides}} {{depends on the}} uniform application of dependable herbicides. A sprayer is needed which will allow for both uniform application and correct droplet size at desired spray volumes. The sprayer should be of sufficient capacity to handle the acreage involved. AGITATION Agitation of most spray solutions is necessary. Any separation will vary the spray concentration. For a simple orifice jet agitator, a flow of 6 gallons per minute for every 100 gallons of tank capacity is usually adequate. SPRAY BOOMS The use of gauge wheels helps maintain the proper distance between the spray nozzle and the target especially on uneven ground, going across terraces, etc. A spray boom where the height and angle of the spray nozzles can be changed is also desirable. The supply lines to and on the spray boom must be of adequate size for even distribution. It is best to have the supply line coming {{to the center of}} the spray <b>boom</b> <b>section</b> and distribute from that point rather than coming in on the end of the spray boom and running the chance of less pressure at the far end. Many sprayers, now, are being designed with wet booms and are fitted with assemblies that protrude 1 / 3 to 1 / 2 way into the boom which take the spray solution out of the middle of the boom. PVC Schedule 80 makes an excellent wet boom if supported adequately. The wet boom, which takes the spray solution from the middle, will help keep materials like sand and rust in the bottom of the spray boom which can be flushed out of the end of the spray boom when it is cleaned. This requires valves or plugs on the end of the spray boom. Shutoff controls are needed that allow use of 1 / 3 to 1 / 2 of the spray boom when necessary...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} for {{the regulation of}} boom sprayers working in circular trajectories has been developed. In this type of trajectory, {{the areas of the}} plots of land treated by the outer nozzles of the boom are treated at reduced rates, and those treated by the inner nozzles are treated in excess. The goal {{of this study was to}} establish the methodology to determine the flow of the individual nozzles on the boom to guarantee that the dose of the product applied per surface unit is similar across the plot. This flow is a function of the position of the equipment (circular trajectory radius) and of the displacement velocity such that the treatment applied per surface unit is uniform. GPS technology was proposed as a basis to establish the position and displacement velocity of the tractor. The viability of this methodology was simulated considering two circular plots with radii of 160 m and 310 m, using three sets of equipment with boom widths of 14. 5, 24. 5 and 29. 5 m. Data showed as increasing boom widths produce bigger errors in the surface dose applied (L/m 2). Error also increases with decreasing plot surface. As an example, considering the three boom widths of 14. 5, 24. 5 and 29. 5 m working on a circular plot with a radius of 160 m, the percentage of surface with errors in the applied surface dose greater than 5 % was 30 %, 58 % and 65 % respectively. Considering a circular plot with radius of 310 m the same errors were 8 %, 22 % and 31 %. To obtain a uniform superficial dose two sprayer regulation alternatives have been simulated considering a 14. 5 m boom: the regulation of the pressure of each nozzle and the regulation of the pressure of each <b>boom</b> <b>section.</b> The viability of implementing the proposed methodology on commercial boom sprayers using GPS antennas to establish the position and displacement velocity of the tractor was justified with a field trial in which a self-guiding commercial GPS system was used along with three precision GPS systems located in the sprayer boom.

40|$|Introduction: During {{the period}} from {{the latter half of}} the 1980 s until just before the Asian {{currency}} crisis in 1997, Indonesiaâs economic development had drawn expectations and attention from various quarters, along with Malaysia and Thailand within the same Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). In fact, the 1993 report by the World Bank, entitled âEast Asian Miracle: Economic Growth and Public Policy,â recognized Indonesia as one of the East Asian economies with the strong economic performance, i. e. sustained economic growth (World Bank [1993]). And it was the manufacturing industry that had been the driving force behind Indonesiaâs economic growth during that period. Since the 1997 outbreak of the Asian currency crisis, however, the manufacturing sector in Indonesia has been mired in a situation that rules out the kind of bright prospects it had emanated previously. The Indonesian economy is still in the developing stage, and in accordance with the history of industrial structural changes in other countries, Indonesiaâs manufacturing industry can still be expected to serve as the engine of the countryâs economic development. But is it really possible in an environment where economic liberalization and globalization are forging ahead? And, what sort of problems have to be dealt with to make it possible? To answer these questions, it is necessary to know the current conditions of Indonesiaâs manufacturing sector, and to do that, it becomes important to think back on the history of the countryâs industrialization. Thus, this paper is intended to retrace and unlock the track of Indonesiaâs industrialization up until the establishment of the manufacturing sector in its present form, with the ultimate goal being to give answers to the above-mentioned questions. Subject to an analysis in this paper is {{the period from}} the installment of President Soehartoâs administration onward when industrialization of the modern industrial sector 2 moved into high gear. ãããThe composition of this paper is outlined below. Section 1 first shows why it is important to examine import substitution and export orientation, both of which are used as the measures of the analysis in this paper, in tracking the history of the industrialization, and then discuss indicators of import substitution and export orientation as well as statistical data and resources needed to develop those indicators. Section 2 clarifies the status of the manufacturing industry among all industries by looking at the composition ratio of the manufacturing industry in terms of value added, imports and exports. Section 3 to 5 cover three periods between 1971 and 1995 and make an analysis of import substitution, export orientation and changes in the industrial structure for each period. Section 3 analyzes the period from 1971 through 1985, when Indonesia pursued the import substitution policy amid the oil <b>boom.</b> <b>Section</b> 4 covers the period from 1985 through 1990, when the packages of deregulatory measures were announced successively under structural adjustment policies made necessary by the fall in oil prices. Section 5 examines the period from 1990 through 1995, which saw the alternate shifts between the overheating of the economy by sharply rising investment by both domestic and foreign investors in the wake of the liberalization of investment, trade and financial services, and polices to cool down the economy. Section 6, which covers the 1995 - 1999 period straddling the economic crisis, is designed for an analysis of the changes in production trends before and after the economic crisis as well as the changes in the industrial structure. Section 7, after summing up the history of Indonesiaâs industrialization examined in the previous sections, discusses problems found in respective sectors and attempts to present future prospects for the countryâs manufacturing industry...|$|E

40|$|By definition, {{spray drift}} is {{composed}} of applied pesticide that has failed to reach the intended target. Most sprayers treat an entire area with little consideration for or ability to adapt to target or environmental conditions. Sensing and control systems for agricultural sprayers can reduce spray drift by adjusting the spray output to focus deposition exclusively on targets, compensate for variable environmental conditions or alter the application rate in accordance with a priori knowledge of the crop or other target. Technology and techniques for such applications is generally referred to as âprecision agricultureâ. In this paper, the term âprecision application â refers to technologies and strategies where broadcast application of agrochemicals is replaced by targeted application and / or control of the application based on sensing of environmental conditions. Specific examples include target detection systems for field and orchard crops, droplet size and rate control systems and selective application systems that allow reduction or elimination of chemicals with potential drift concerns. Sensing and control systems can significantly reduce the applied rate of pesticide while maintaining target deposition levels necessary for efficacious pest control. Order-of- magnitude reductions can be achieved under some conditions while 25 â 50 % reductions in are present {{at the time of}} treatment. Examples include selective control of emerged weeds and foliar applications of insecticides and fungicides when crop plants are sparse or exhibit spatial non-uniformity. The systems require sensors, algorithms and spray system actuators with fast response times and high spatial resolution. âSpot spray â systems are examples of the sense-and-treat approach. Map-based control is often used for application of pre-emergent herbicides and crop nutrients on spatial scales limited by GPS accuracy or width of individually-controllable spray <b>boom</b> <b>sections.</b> In these systems, sensing and treatment chemical rate can be routinely achieved...|$|R
40|$|Recent legislation, LOLER, {{removed the}} {{compulsion}} of periodical proof testing of lifting equipment to ascertain its "fitness for purpose". It {{has become the}} responsibility of a competent person to assess equipment's fitness for purpose and ability for continued safe use. This thesis reviews the technologies available to the competent person to enable him/her {{to come to an}} informed decision regarding the condition of mechanical structures. It was identified that an optimal methodology would interrogate structural integrity whilst the equipment performed its intended function. Coupling a means of assessment with the equipment's operation allows the investigator to focus on only defective conditions that will limit the future operation. Such an approach of condition monitoring structural integrity as opposed to employing traditional methods of inspection that are essentially failure finding tasks permits the discrimination between benign and malignant defects. Restorative and replacement activities can therefore take place based upon the likelihood of equipment's functional failure. The supplementary monitoring of Acoustic Emission (AE), with the established industrial practice of proof testing, was considered to provide data to monitor structural integrity and provide the basis upon which a structure can be re-qualified for future service. The nature of failure of engineering materials was examined which identified failure modes such as corrosion, creep and fatigue resulted in a progressive degradation of a localised area. The AE is a proportion of energy released during such deterioration. Further it was determined that {{the rate at which the}} deterioration increased was non-linear. Within a laboratory environment wire ropes with seeded faults were subjected to a simulated life during which the qualitative and quantitative nature of the AE was investigated. It was found that the quantity of the emission generated during proof tests was indicative of the severity of the induced defect. This substantiated the claim that AE could be used to enhance the proof test and provide a means by which a condition assessment could be made at intervals throughout the life of a structure. A series of five case studies explored the use of AE on a variety of differing in-service mechanical structures, mostly lifting equipmept. The case studies were conducted on pad-eyes,link-plates, cranes, both Electrical Overhead Travelling (EOT) and pedestal cranes and finally, an underwater vehicle pressure hull. The approach of using the combination of AE with a proof test was verified in the cases of pad-eyes and EOT cranes. In the instance of link plates, simultaneous measurement of strain and AE during a load test demonstrated the ability of AE to detect localised yielding. During the destruction test of a pedestal crane <b>boom</b> <b>section,</b> various conventional methods of AE evaluation were utilised to investigate which would provide the most reliable condition indicator; it was found that Intensity Analysis generated the most effective trendable measurement. A study on a pressure hull with known fatigue cracks that were subjected to both static and dynamic testing whilst monitoring with AE was conducted. The fatigue cracks were sized pre and post the trial using Time of Flight Diffraction (ToFD). During the trial Alternating Current Potential Drop (ACPD) was used to detect any growth as it occurred. Such techniques were used to substantiate claims AE could detect a propagating defect. When the AE is viewed in conjunction with ACPD results and the measurements attained with the ToFD it was clear that all three techniques concluded that crack growth occurred at two sites. Finally the investigation returns to a laboratory to exarnine the robustness of the technique through the life of a mechanical structure. The objective being to identify if periodical measurement of AE taken during the course of the life of the structure would repetitively generate information pertaining to the identification of the flaw as well as the severity of the flaw as it initiates and propagates through to failure. A power law was fitted to the data acquired during the proof tests. The use of a power law was considered appropriate due to the previously identified non-linear nature of material failure. A Scanning Electron Microscope was used to visually examine the fracture surfaces. It was found that increasing increments between striations on the fracture surface illustrated the non-linear increase of crack extensions during fatigue and corroborated the appropriateness of fitting a power law to the proof test data. Such an investigation permitted the conclusion that the approach of fitting a power law to the discrete energies from sequential proof tests is an appropriate method of attaining a trendable condition indicator. The competent person could employ such a methodology for the purposes of attaining information upon which an informed decision can be made on the continued safe use of mechanical structures.

40|$|In {{cooperation}} with the two companies SYMACON Bildverarbeitung GmbH Barleben and MÃ¼ller-Elektronik GmbH & Co. KG Salzkotten a sensor controlled field sprayer for precise plant protection was developed at the Leibniz-institute for Agricultural Engineering. In narrow seeded field crops like cereals, the weed detection is done within the tramlines. Because {{of the way the}} system operates, there is no discrimination between cultivated crops and weeds. In later growth stages, crop and weed are overlapping and discrimination within the plant stand becomes difficult or even impossible. Situational, the weed number (early growth stages) or the weed coverage level (late growth stages) can be used as parameter to control the field sprayer. The sensor is positioned at the front three point linkage of the tractor. Field sprayers with a fast adaption of the application rate are not yet commercially available. In contrast to other âon/offâ sensor controlled application systems which are on the market or under development, the application rate in the presented technology is in- or decreased according to the sensor signal. At heavy weed infested sites of the field, the customary application rate is sprayed. It is reduced up to 50 % at sites with low weed pressure. Between the volume of 50 % and 100 %, the application rate is proportional adapted to the weed infestation. In contrast to the âon/offâ switching of single nozzles or <b>boom</b> <b>sections,</b> no sites are left unsprayed using the variable rate approach. There is no risk of unobstructed weed development or seed setting. In autumn 2009, a 26 ha winter barley field on a farm was sprayed against weeds with the sensor controlled field sprayer. The product FalkonÂ® was used with the dosage of 1 l/ha. The spray volume was varied between 100 and 200 l/ha. The product savings were on average 20 %...|$|R

A square <b>boom</b> cross <b>section</b> is desirable for interface reasons. These requirements and others are satisfied by the X-beam. The X-beam folds by simple geometry, using single-degree-of-freedom hinges at simple angles, with no strain during deployment. Strut members are of large diameter with unidirectional graphite fibers for maximum beam performance. Fittings are aluminum with phosphor bronze bushings so that compliance is low and joint lifetime is high. The several beam types required for different applications on the space station will use the same basic design, with changes in strut cross section where necessary. Deployment is by a BI-STEM which pushes the beam out; retraction is by cables which cause initial folding and pull the beam in...|$|R
