50|$|Spin {{fishing is}} an angling {{technique}} where a spinning lure {{is used to}} entice the fish to bite. Spin fishing is used in both freshwater and marine environments. Spin fishing is distinguished between fly fishing and <b>bait</b> <b>cast</b> fishing {{by the type of}} rod and reel used. There are two types of reels used when spin fishing, the open faced reel and the closed faced reel. The spin fishing rod has no trigger attached {{to the base of the}} fishing rod. This is what differentiates the spin fishing rod from the <b>bait</b> <b>casting</b> fishing rod.|$|R

2500|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, bass fishing had been well {{established}} as a sport with its own following. [...] Though the use of artificial lures for bass had begun with the artificial fly and fly fishing tackle, the <b>bait</b> <b>casting</b> rod and reel soon came to dominate the sport. [...] Although fixed-spool reels were introduced in use in the United States {{as early as the}} 1870s, spinning reels and rods did not gain wide acceptance as an angling tool until the 1950s. [...] Since that time, most bass anglers have used <b>bait</b> <b>casting</b> or spinning tackle, using either artificial lures or live bait (See Fishing rod, Fishing reel).|$|R

50|$|Four single-strand curved mold <b>casting</b> <b>machines</b> <b>cast</b> around 3000 {{tons per}} day. Only two <b>casting</b> <b>machines</b> will {{normally}} <b>cast</b> {{at one time}} and many people questioned the need for four units.

50|$|It is {{here that}} the design of {{continuous}} <b>casting</b> <b>machines</b> may vary. This describes a 'curved apron' casting machine; vertical configurations are also used. In a curved apron <b>casting</b> <b>machine,</b> the strand exits the mold vertically (or on a near vertical curved path) and as it travels through the spray-chamber, the rollers gradually curve the strand towards the horizontal. In a vertical <b>casting</b> <b>machine,</b> the strand stays vertical as it passes through the spray-chamber. Molds in a curved apron <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> can be straight or curved, depending on the basic design of the machine.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} reduce casting defects and improve casting quality, the author has {{developed}} a three-dimensional parallel vibration <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> based on parallel mechanism. The paper introduces the three-dimensional parallel vibration <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> in structure composition and functional properties, the <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> degree of freedom of excitation mechanism is calculated, its motion performance is analyzed, and the kinematics equations are established. The designed <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> achieves support and excitation functional separation of moving parts which takes complete decoupling of hybrid mechanism 2 PRRR-P (2 R) as excitation mechanism, realizing flask vibration along the X, Y, Z three directions. Test results show that, the <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> can significantly improve casting quality, raise labor productivity, save casting raw materials, and reduce the production costs...|$|R

50|$|Molten metal is {{tapped into}} the ladle from furnaces. After {{undergoing}} any ladle treatments, such as alloying and degassing, and {{arriving at the}} correct temperature, the ladle is transported {{to the top of}} the <b>casting</b> <b>machine.</b> Usually the ladle sits in a slot on a rotating turret at the <b>casting</b> <b>machine.</b> One ladle is in the 'on-cast' position (feeding the <b>casting</b> <b>machine)</b> while the other is made ready in the 'off-cast' position, and is switched to the casting position when the first ladle is empty.|$|R

2500|$|Spool {{tension on}} most modern baitcasting reels can be {{adjusted}} with adjustable spool tension, a centrifugal brake, or a magnetic [...] "cast control." [...] This reduces spool overrun during a cast and the resultant line snare, known as backlash, colloquially called a [...] "bird's nest" [...] or [...] "birdie". This backlash {{is a result of}} the angular momentum of the spool and line which is not present with a fixed spool or spinning reel. [...] Each time a lure of a different weight is attached, the cast control must be adjusted for the difference in weight. [...] The <b>bait</b> <b>casting</b> reel design will operate well with a wide variety of fishing lines, ranging from braided multifilament and heat-fused [...] "superlines" [...] to copolymer, fluorocarbon, and nylon monofilaments (see Fishing line). [...] Most <b>bait</b> <b>casting</b> reels can also easily be palmed or thumbed to increase the drag, set the hook, or to accurately halt the lure at a given point in the cast.|$|R
40|$|Continuous casting is a {{dominant}} production technology of steelmaking {{which is currently}} used for more that 95 % of the world steel production. Mathematical modelling and optimal control of <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> are crucial tasks in continuous steel casting which directly influence productivity and quality of produced steel, competitiveness of steelworks, safety of <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> operation {{and its impact on}} the environment. This thesis concerns with the development and implementation of the numerical model of temperature field for continuously cast steel billets and its use for optimal control of the <b>casting</b> <b>machine.</b> The numerical model was developed and implemented in MATLAB. Due to computational demands the model was parallelized by means of the computation on graphics processing units NVIDIA with the computational architecture CUDA. Validation and verification of the model were performed with the use of operational data from Trinecke zelezarny steelworks. The model was then utilized as a part of the developed model-based predictive control system for the optimal control of dynamic situations in the <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> operation. The behaviour of the developed control system was examined by means of dynamic model situations that have confirmed the ability of the implemented system to optimally control dynamic operations of the continuous <b>casting</b> <b>machine.</b> Both the numerical model of the temperature field and the model-based predictive control system have been implemented so that they can be modified for any <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> and this allows for their prospective commercial applications...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of bridge orientation in <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> on castability and quality of base metal castings. Methods: Three groups of patterns with different direction and lengths in <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> were <b>casted</b> and then studied qualitatively and quantitatively using mean and standard deviation in table of frequency. Results: Larger nodules and porosities were on the joints of sprue in horizontal specimens (P= 0. 01 and 0. 048, respectively). There was no significant difference in castability between 3 -, 5 - and 6 -unit bridges in relation to their direction in <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> (P= 0. 5). An increase in bridge length led to more variation in length and width. The position of bridges also played an important role in the length variation in bridges. Conclusion: The direction of bridges had no effect on base metal castability but a vertical position resulted in a better casting quality and an increase in length of the bridges caused more defects in castings...|$|R
