5000|$|Carter {{discovers the}} rat-eaten skeletons of four men chained {{up in the}} castle dungeons - {{the remains of the}} former lovers of Gerda van Rothe. Nearby Carter finds the {{printing}} presses for the counterfeit <b>banknotes.</b> He <b>destroys</b> the printing plates and frees the captive print workers.|$|R
50|$|Money burning or burning {{money is}} the {{purposeful}} act of destroying money. In the prototypical example, <b>banknotes</b> are <b>destroyed</b> by literally setting them on fire. Burning money decreases {{the wealth of the}} owner without directly enriching any particular party. However, according to the quantity theory of money, because it reduces the supply of money it increases by the same amount the collective wealth of everyone else who holds money.|$|R
50|$|The {{historic}} theatre {{building on}} Calea Victoriei — now {{featured on the}} 100-leu <b>banknote</b> — was <b>destroyed</b> during the Luftwaffe bombardment of Bucharest on August 24, 1944 (see Bombing of Bucharest in World War II).|$|R
25|$|In the United States, {{banknotes}} last {{an average}} of three years until they are no longer fit for circulation, after which they are collected for destruction, usually recycling or shredding. A banknote is removed from the money supply by banks or other financial institutions because of everyday wear and tear from its handling. Banknote bundles are passed through a sorting machine that determines whether a particular note needs to be shredded, or are removed from the supply chain by a human inspector if they are deemed unfit for continued use – for example, if they are mutilated or torn. Counterfeit <b>banknotes</b> are <b>destroyed</b> unless they are needed for evidentiary or forensic purposes.|$|R
50|$|A seventh {{series of}} Swiss {{banknotes}} {{was designed and}} printed in 1984, in parallel with the sixth series, but was never released. It formed the reserve series, to be released, for example, if the current series would suddenly become widely counterfeited. At first, almost no information was released on the series for security reasons, except for small fragments. However, after the eighth series was released, {{it was decided to}} improve the security features of the current series rather than develop a new reserve series. The details of the seventh series were later released, while the actual <b>banknotes</b> were <b>destroyed.</b> The designers were Roger Pfund and Elisabeth Pfund. They had originally won the competition for the design of the sixth series, but since the Swiss National Bank decided to use the design by Ernst and Ursula Hiestand instead, the Pfunds were charged with the design of the reserve series.|$|R
25|$|The Federal Reserve {{announced}} {{the removal of}} large denominations of United States currency from circulation on July 14, 1969. The one-hundred-dollar bill was the largest denomination left in circulation. All the Federal Reserve Notes produced from Series 1928 up to before Series 1969 (i.e. 1928, 1928A, 1934, 1934A, 1934B, 1934C, 1934D, 1950, 1950A, 1950B, 1950C, 1950D, 1950E, 1963, 1966, 1966A) of the $100 denomination added up to $23.1708 billion. Since some <b>banknotes</b> had been <b>destroyed,</b> and the population was 200 million at the time, there was less than one $100 banknote per capita circulating.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the first}} five weeks, the murder victims came only from the nearby areas. On {{reaching}} their final destination before [...] "transport" [...] to Germany and Austria, the Jews disembarked {{in the courtyard of}} the Schlosslager manor where the SS men wearing white coats and pretending to be medics waited for them with a translator released earlier from the Gestapo prison in Poznań. The victims were led to a large empty room and ordered to undress; their clothing stacked for disinfection. They were told that all hidden <b>banknotes</b> would be <b>destroyed</b> during steaming and needed to be taken out and handed over for safe-keeping. Occasionally they were met by a German officer dressed as a local squire with a Tyrolean hat, announcing that some of them would remain there.|$|R
40|$|A {{repulping}} {{approach of}} waste Chinese banknote paper, i. e., Renminbi (RMB) paper with high wet strength, was studied, and a dual-pH pretreatment process was used before refining. Pretreatment temperature, soaking time, and consistency of waste RMB paper were investigated {{to obtain the}} optimum repulping parameters. The results showed that when the pretreatment temperature was 80 oC, soaking time was 60 min, and consistency was 10 %, the repulping yield was 88. 1 %. The arithmetic and weighted mean lengths of fine pulp fibers from the optimum experiment were 0. 564 mm and 0. 785 mm, respectively, and the mean width was 22. 5 μm. Obvious kinks and broken ends, {{as well as a}} slight curl of fine pulp fibers were observed by analyses with a Morfi-compact fiber analyzer and a scanning electron microscope. The results from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis possibly demonstrated that the ester bonds in waste <b>banknote</b> paper were <b>destroyed</b> after the dual-pH pretreatment...|$|R
