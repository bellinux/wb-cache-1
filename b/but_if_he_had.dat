25|$|The French fleet, {{composed}} of 14 galleons, 13 pataches, 17 galleys and 3 fireships, was soon put on line {{and opened fire}} on the Spanish fleet. Sourdis' vice-admiral was ahead with 6 ships and 5 galleys, Sourdis followed him with 11 ships and 7 galleys, while 12 ships and 5 galleys closed the formation. Sourdis sailed towards the Point of Salou, attempting to bar the way to Maqueda. The Spaniards immediately responded to the fire with their galleons, causing serious damage to the French galleons, and forcing the French fleet to leave the harbor entrance. With the blockade broken, and the French fleet engaged in battle with the Spanish galleons, the Spanish convoy of 65 ships, escorted by some Spanish galleys, entered the port, to the great joy of the defenders. Having achieved the main objective, the Spanish galleys were reorganized and attacked the flank of the French fleet. At the same time, Maqueda fell upon the French vanguard supported by his galleons. In {{the middle of the}} action, the ship under admiral Orellana lost its mainsail and had to be relieved by the Testa de Oro. The French galleons Forte and Licorne were put out of action, but Sourdis did not lost a single ship. Having managed to hold off a superior fleet, he ordered the withdrawal on 25 August. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> saved his whole fleet, the Spaniards had obtained the naval control of the area. The siege of Tarragona was lifted, and the Spanish fleet was able to provision the towns of Roses, Perpignan and Collioure.|$|E
2500|$|Law {{initially}} became {{frustrated with}} the slow speed of Parliament compared to the rapid pace of the Glasgow iron market, and Austen Chamberlain recalled him saying to Chamberlain that [...] "it was very well for men who, like myself {{had been able to}} enter the House of Commons young to adapt to a Parliamentary career, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> known what the House of Commons was he would never had entered at this stage". He soon learnt to be patient, however, and on 18 February 1901 made his maiden speech. Replying to anti-Boer War MPs including David Lloyd George, Law used his excellent memory to quote sections of Hansard back to the opposition which contained their previous speeches supporting and commending the policies they now denounced. Although lasting only fifteen minutes and not a crowd- or press-pleaser like the maiden speeches of F.E. Smith or Winston Churchill, it attracted the attention of the Conservative Party leaders.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first was}} the nature of the [...] "cash" [...] which the {{contract}} specified be used as the down payment in 1854. Justice Field concluded that [...] "cash" [...] meant gold coin, as no other form of legal tender existed in 1854. The creation of paper currency subsequent to the 1854 contract did not alleviate Willard of the requirement that the down payment be made in [...] "cash" [...] (e.g., gold coin), Field held. But the issue did not end there. Had Willard acted in good faith in offering the U.S. Notes? [...] If not, then no relief was likely: The contract had expired, and Willard had not acted in a timely fashion to secure his rights under it by submitting a cash down-payment. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> acted in good faith, then Willard would be able to seek relief from courts of equity. The constitutionality of the National Banking Act was not at issue, the Court said, because the issue before the Court was not whether paper currency constituted [...] "cash" [...] but whether Willard acted in good faith (e.g., had assumed in good faith that U.S. Notes constitute cash, as Congress had said they did). Field laid out extensive reasons for why Willard had acted in good faith: ...|$|E

2500|$|A similar {{incident}} {{occurred in the}} Second Test, though {{it might not have}} been seen as a problem if it had not followed the events of the first. Bradman was on 22 when he appeared to snick another catch to Ikin at short leg, but [...] "this time there may have been some cause for doubt; it was an appeal that could have gone either way". Bradman was given not out and made 234, so in his first two innings he made 421 runs, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> he been given out he would have made only 50. In the Fourth Test at Adelaide Cyril Washbrook was given out to Ray Lindwall to a ball that Don Tallon scooped off the ground. Washbrook [...] "stood there transfixed. Even some of the Australian leg-side fielders expressed amazement". Tallon was known for his impetuous appealing - [...] "he was often roaring before he had studied facts and it was his over-eagerness that brought about the shocking decision" [...] - and Bradman asked him if he still wanted to appeal. Tallon said he did and Bradman stood by the decision. It was later suggested that Tallon told Bradman {{that it was not a}} clean catch and Clif Cary thought if Bradman had gone into the matter further he would have recalled Washbrook as had happened in other such cases. The Australian reporter Ray Robinson wrote [...] "I believe nearby fieldsmen were impetuous in appealing as the wicket-keeper scooped up the ball, and that the hesitant umpire would have been wiser to have asked his square-leg colleague whether it carried to the gloves or was gathered on the half-volley". Hammond tried to locate a press photograph of the ball touching the ground to show the ABC, who demanded proof of the incompetence of the umpires before they were willing to change them, but no photo was found.|$|E
