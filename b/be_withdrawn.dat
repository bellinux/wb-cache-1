5|$|In 2004, {{following}} the largest trans-national election in history, despite the European Council choosing a President from the largest political group (the EPP), the Parliament again exerted {{pressure on the}} Commission. During the Parliament's hearings of the proposed Commissioners MEPs raised doubts about some nominees with the Civil Liberties committee rejecting Rocco Buttiglione from the post of Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security over his views on homosexuality. That {{was the first time}} the Parliament had ever voted against an incoming Commissioner and despite Barroso's insistence upon Buttiglione the Parliament forced Buttiglione to <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn.</b> A number of other Commissioners also had to <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> or reassigned before Parliament allowed the Barroso Commission to take office.|$|E
5|$|On 10 March 1941, with Operation Barbarossa looming, Felix was {{amended to}} Operation Felix-Heinrich, whereby German troops would <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> from the USSR to capture Gibraltar. As {{a result of}} Spanish {{dictator}} Francisco Franco's intransigence, the operation was postponed, modified, and ultimately abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War later exonerated Burnside, {{and placed}} {{the blame for the}} Union defeat at the Crater on General Meade for {{requiring}} the specially trained USCT (United States Colored Troops) men to <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In February 1988, {{three members}} of the class <b>were</b> <b>withdrawn.</b> DI 1808 <b>was</b> <b>withdrawn</b> after a {{flash-over}} in its main generator, and was dismantled at Hutt Workshops in 1991. DI 1814 <b>was</b> <b>withdrawn</b> due to an unknown reason, while 1837 <b>was</b> <b>withdrawn</b> after throwing a conrod. 1843 <b>was</b> <b>withdrawn</b> in May 1989 after being damaged in a level crossing accident near Otaki.|$|R

50|$|On 18 July 1992, the Monday to Saturday service <b>was</b> <b>withdrawn</b> between Ladbroke Grove and Paddington, being {{replaced}} by new route 23. In May 1993 this section <b>was</b> <b>withdrawn</b> on Sundays, and in September 1999 route 15 <b>was</b> <b>withdrawn</b> between Poplar and Canning Town, with buses diverted to serve Blackwall station. In August 2003 the route <b>was</b> <b>withdrawn</b> between Blackwall and East Ham.|$|R
5|$|At 11 am a {{disturbance}} {{started in the}} chapel at Strangeways Prison when some 300 prisoners attacked staff. Those prisoners then gained access to the chapel roof and then broke into the living accommodation in the main prison. Other prisoners, including those on remand, joined in the disturbance and staff had to <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn.</b> The perimeter is secure.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin {{published}} The Songlines in 1987, and {{it became}} a bestseller in both the United Kingdom and the United States. The book was nominated for the Thomas Cook Travel Award, but Chatwin requested that it <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> from consideration, saying the work was fictional. Following its publication, Chatwin became friends with composer Kevin Volans, who was inspired to base a theatre score on the book. The project evolved into an opera, The Man with Footsoles of Wind (1993).|$|E
5|$|Florins (usually dated 1947 or later) {{remained}} in circulation after Decimal Day. In 1987, following {{a study of}} the currency, the Thatcher government announced its intent to issue a new ten pence piece, reduced in size. A smaller ten pence piece was issued in 1992, after which the old florin was demonetised on 30 June 1993. The florin, the first decimal coin, was the last coin in general circulation just prior to decimalisation to <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Most {{machines}} <b>were</b> <b>withdrawn</b> during 2007 and 2008. The last Avantix B8070 <b>was</b> <b>withdrawn</b> in January 2009.|$|R

5|$|In 2009, five Merlin Mk3s were {{operating}} in Afghanistan, transporting troops and supplies. The deployment to Afghanistan was criticised as the aircraft reportedly lacked protective Kevlar armour. By July 2010, the Merlin fleet was fully fitted with ballistic armour. The deployment of Merlins to Afghanistan allowed the detachment of Sea Kings to <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> {{from the region}} in October 2011. As part of the UK drawdown in Afghanistan, Merlins were withdrawn from theatre in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|On October 16 {{the miners}} held {{a meeting and}} {{unanimously}} voted to return to work. They did so beginning the next day, having won nothing in concessions. On October 19, the Governor advised President Rutherford B. Hayes that the federal troops could <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn.</b> The Thirteenth Infantry departed the city on October 31, and Colonel Hartley's temporary forces departed in November 1877.|$|E
5|$|On October 3, 2005, Bush {{nominated}} {{long time}} White House Counsel Harriet Miers for O'Connor's position. After facing significant opposition from both parties, who found {{her to be}} ill-prepared and uninformed on the law, Miers asked that her name <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> on October 27. Four days later, on October 31, Bush nominated federal appellate judge Samuel Alito. Alito was confirmed as the 110th Supreme Court Justice on January 31, 2006.|$|E
50|$|All <b>were</b> <b>withdrawn</b> between 1959 and 1963 as {{daylight}} country {{passenger trains}} <b>were</b> <b>withdrawn</b> {{and replaced by}} road coaches.|$|R

25|$|The final Gatwick Express units <b>were</b> <b>withdrawn</b> in 2005. Both {{of these}} units (nos. 489104/110) had <b>been</b> <b>withdrawn</b> in 2000 and 2001 respectively, but were {{overhauled}} {{and returned to}} use in 2002. They replaced units 489103/108, which <b>were</b> <b>withdrawn</b> from traffic as they were due overhaul.|$|R
5|$|The most {{important}} side effect {{is an increase}} in risk for epileptic seizures, which caused the drug to <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> from the market for some time and then caused the recommended dosage to be reduced. In comparison to many other antidepressants, it does not cause as much weight gain, sexual dysfunction, or sleepiness. Bupropion acts as an norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It is an atypical antidepressant, different from most commonly prescribed antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
5|$|A {{successful}} Allied {{offensive in}} May finally {{broke through the}} Gustav Line, and Rome fell to Clark's army on 4 June. On 13 June, Devers ordered Larkin to shift priority for supplies from Fifth Army in Italy to Seventh Army. Two days later, Wilson ordered VI Corps to <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> from the front line in preparation for Anvil. Virtually all the material needed for the assault was on hand, on the way, or promised, thanks to Devers' efforts to preserve the stockpile of Anvil stores and supplies even when the operation was in doubt. To command the assault, he created a special headquarters on Corsica called Advanced Detachment AFHQ, with Devers in command.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they had}} {{initially}} {{been told that}} they would <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> from the front within 48 hours, the strategic situation called that they remained at the front holding the ground on the eastern flank. In late July a breakout from the beachhead was attempted and the 1st Special Service Brigade moved through the Le Bois de Bavent, a large wooded area, as the Germans began to withdraw. Nevertheless, little progress was made, and, after a brief move which saw No. 6 Commando advance to Bavent, they went on the defensive again.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{exception}} of numbers 9 and 10, all had <b>been</b> <b>withdrawn</b> from service by 1911. Number 10 <b>was</b> <b>withdrawn</b> in 1944 while in 1948 no 9 passed into the ownership of the Indian government, along with 34 B Class engines. [...] It <b>was</b> <b>withdrawn</b> in 1954.|$|R

50|$|One R class {{locomotive}} (no. 341) <b>was</b> <b>withdrawn</b> in 1914 due to accident damage. The other 11 locomotives {{which had}} not been rebuilt to the R1 class <b>were</b> <b>withdrawn</b> between 1931 and 1943. Of the 13 R1 class rebuilds, one <b>was</b> <b>withdrawn</b> in 1949, two in 1955, three in 1958 and five in 1959; after August 1959, only nos. 31047 and 31337 were left, and these <b>were</b> <b>withdrawn</b> in March and February 1960 respectively.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the raid, it was decided by the British naval command that unless {{sufficient}} destroyers were available to protect the barrage, the drifters would have to <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> at night. The drifters would only be operating for less than twelve hours a day, and would have to leave their positions by 15:00 every day. Despite the damage received by the Austro-Hungarian cruisers during the pursuit by Dartmouth and Bristol, the Austro-Hungarian forces inflicted more serious casualties on the Allied blockade. In addition to the sunk and damaged drifters, the cruiser Dartmouth was nearly sunk by the German submarine UC-25, the French destroyer Boutefeu was mined and sunk, and a munitions convoy to Valona was interdicted.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{were now}} made {{to find a}} role for the {{remaining}} 19 locomotives. By now many had been relegated to hauling trains in what were once seen as remote outposts of the LMS. Often they were reduced to pulling stopping trains, empty stock trains, or even goods trains. Only one realistic mainline role was contemplated: to replace the Scottish Region A4 Class on the testing route between Edinburgh Waverley and Aberdeen. This idea was discarded largely {{because it would be}} excessively problematic to train the A4 crews to operate the Coronations. With no credible role, only one option remained: in July 1964 it was resolved that the remaining 19 locomotives were to <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> from 12 September.|$|E
5|$|Belgian plans did {{not call}} for the {{garrison}} of the fort and the attached defending forces to fight a sustained battle against an attacking force; {{it was assumed that}} sufficient warning of an attack would be given so that the detachment on {{the eastern side of the}} canal could <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn,</b> the bridges destroyed and the garrison ready to fight a delaying action. The defending force would then retire to the main defensive positions along the River Dyle, where they would link up with other Allied forces.|$|E
50|$|One {{locomotive}} <b>was</b> <b>withdrawn</b> in 1947 and {{the others}} had all <b>been</b> <b>withdrawn</b> {{by the end of}} 1951. None are preserved.|$|R

50|$|The unrebuilt {{locomotives}} <b>were</b> <b>withdrawn</b> by Hugh Smellie between 1882 and 1888. The rebuilt locomotives <b>were</b> <b>withdrawn</b> between 1890 and 1904.|$|R
5|$|Currency is {{indirectly}} {{received from}} Ness' father, who can also save the game's progress. Each time the party wins a battle, Ness' father deposits money in an account that can <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> at ATMs. In towns, players can visit various stores where weapons, armor, and items can be bought. Weapons and armor can be equipped to increase character strength and defense, respectively. In addition, items {{can be used}} for a number of purposes, such as healing. Towns also contain several other useful facilities such as hospitals where players can be healed for a fee.|$|E
5|$|Firefighting {{operations}} were resumed at about 20:00, {{and it was}} anticipated that all fires could be extinguished during the night. Further damage occurred {{to one of the}} storage tanks {{in the early hours of}} Tuesday morning, causing firefighters to <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> once again, but operations resumed at 08:30. By midday on 13 December, all but three fires had been extinguished, although the largest tank was still burning. Bronze commandoperations on the groundwas visited by the Bishop of St Albans, the local vicar, and the industrial chaplain supporting the fire crews, to see how they were coping.|$|E
5|$|In September 1922, {{the ground}} held a Grand Fete, {{to raise money}} to repair the tower of Blacklands Church. In 1948, the ground was flooded, and the Public Health Committee report into the storm floods had to <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> after a {{magistrate}} appeared to provide misinformation in his statutory declaration. In his declaration, he had claimed to have been at the Central Recreation Ground for two 15 minute time periods during the flooding period and claimed to have seen the flooding, but at those times, the ground had not yet been flooded. The ground had previously flooded in 1866, when one resident noted that it had been underwater many times within their memory.|$|E
