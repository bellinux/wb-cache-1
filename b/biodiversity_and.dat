5|$|In {{recognition}} of the established and popular activity of mountain biking in the greater Adelaide area, and to better accommodate the mountain biking community in the north eastern suburbs, it was proposed in 2006 to permit cycling in designated zones on purpose-built tracks and on certain management tracks within the park.

These distinctly exceed the tree line. In Greenland, the habitat may reach the 77th latitude line. The Myxogastria species reach their largest <b>biodiversity</b> <b>and</b> highest frequency in forests of temperate regions, which are ideal habitats because of the amount of rich organic material, suitable humidity (not too high) and long-lasting snow cover for snow-inhabiting species.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the average}} {{depth of the}} ocean is about 4300metres, the photic zone {{represents}} {{only a tiny fraction}} of the ocean’s total volume. However, due to its capacity for photosynthesis, the photic zone has the greatest <b>biodiversity</b> <b>and</b> biomass of all oceanic zones. Nearly all primary production in the ocean occurs here. Life forms which inhabit the aphotic zone are often capable of movement upwards through the water column into the photic zone for feeding. Otherwise, they must rely on material sinking from above, or find another source of energy and nutrition, such as occurs in chemosynthetic archaea found near hydrothermal vents and cold seeps.|$|E
5|$|Sites in Africa {{have been}} marked as such {{for a variety}} of reasons, such as {{deforestation}} and hunting, civil war, threats to and hostage taking of reserve staff, oil and gas projects and mining, declines in <b>biodiversity,</b> <b>and</b> structural damage to buildings. Three sites were formerly declared as being in danger, but have since lost the status: the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (19841989), the Rwenzori Mountains National Park (19992004), and Tipasa (20022006). The Garamba National Park and Timbuktu have also lost their statuses in 1992 and 2005, respectively, but later regained it in 1996 and 2012. Despite its large number of endangered sites and the circumstances surrounding them, African World Heritage Sites have never been stripped of their title, something that has only occurred twice.|$|E
5|$|The IAPT's {{primary purpose}} is the {{promotion}} {{and understanding of}} biodiversity—the discovery, naming, classification, and systematics of plants—for both living and fossil plants.

5|$|The {{biology of}} life {{operates}} {{within a certain}} range of temperatures. Heat {{is a form of}} energy that regulates temperature. Heat affects growth rates, activity, behaviour, and primary production. Temperature is largely dependent on the incidence of solar radiation. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of temperature greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of <b>biodiversity</b> <b>and</b> levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity. Poikilotherms, for example, have a body temperature that is largely regulated and dependent on the temperature of the external environment. In contrast, homeotherms regulate their internal body temperature by expending metabolic energy.|$|E
5|$|The {{consequences}} of a persistent biotic crisis have been predicted to last {{for at least five}} million years. It could result in a decline in <b>biodiversity</b> <b>and</b> homogenization of biotas, accompanied by a proliferation of species that are opportunistic, such as pests and weeds. Novel species may also emerge; in particular taxa that prosper in human-dominated ecosystems may rapidly diversify into many new species. Microbes are likely to benefit from the increase in nutrient-enriched environmental niches. No new species of existing large vertebrates are likely to arise and food chains will probably be shortened.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecology of}} global carbon budgets gives {{one example of}} the linkage between <b>biodiversity</b> <b>and</b> biogeochemistry. It is {{estimated}} that the Earth's oceans hold 40,000 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon, that vegetation and soil hold 2070 Gt, and that fossil fuel emissions are 6.3 Gt carbon per year. There have been major restructurings in these global carbon budgets during the Earth's history, regulated to a large extent by the ecology of the land. For example, through the early-mid Eocene volcanic outgassing, the oxidation of methane stored in wetlands, and seafloor gases increased atmospheric CO2 (carbon dioxide) concentrations to levels as high as 3500ppm.|$|E

5|$|The {{park was}} {{established}} in 1966 and {{is considered one of}} the most important protected areas for the maintenance of mountainous <b>biodiversity</b> <b>and</b> ecosystem integrity at the national level. Forests of European black pine (Pinus nigra) and common beech (Fagus sylvatica) cover the park's lower and middle altitudes , with several of these trees being more than 700 years old. At higher altitudes , Bosnian pine (Pinus heldreichii) woodland is dominant, while at the greatest heights , only certain types of bushes are found in the treeless alpine meadows. Additionally, the dry places and the lower parts of the valley are characterized by the domination of Buxus sempervirens, while some individuals of Abies borisii-regis are scattered among the Pinus nigra and Fagus sylvatica forests.|$|E
5|$|Trees are an {{important}} part of the terrestrial ecosystem, providing essential habitats including many kinds of forest for communities of organisms. Epiphytic plants such as ferns, some mosses, liverworts, orchids and some species of parasitic plants (e.g., mistletoe) hang from branches; these along with arboreal lichens, algae, and fungi provide micro-habitats for themselves and for other organisms, including animals. Leaves, flowers and fruits are seasonally available. On the ground underneath trees there is shade, and often there is undergrowth, leaf litter, fallen branches and/or decaying wood that provide other habitat. Trees stabilise the soil, prevent rapid run-off of rain water, help prevent desertification, have a role in climate control and help in the maintenance of <b>biodiversity</b> <b>and</b> ecosystem balance.|$|E
5|$|Biogeography has a {{long history}} in the natural {{sciences}} concerning the spatial distribution of plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies. Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions, such as migration and dispersal. and from historical processes that split populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern distribution of the Earth's biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is called vicariance biogeography and it is a sub-discipline of biogeography. There are also practical applications in the field of biogeography concerning ecological systems and processes. For example, the range and distribution of <b>biodiversity</b> <b>and</b> invasive species responding to climate change is a serious concern and active area of research in the context of global warming.|$|E
40|$|Patagonia, {{an outdoor}} apparel {{company with a}} strong {{environmental}} mission statement, {{has a history of}} supply chain-level efforts aimed at measuring and reducing energy use, water use, waste and greenhouse gas emissions. Up to this point, we have not included a measurement of impacts to land use <b>and</b> <b>biodiversity</b> in our lifecycle assessments. As human demand for resources increases, the availability of land to support biodiversity is shrinking. There is a growing awareness of the importance in assessing industries impacts to land <b>and</b> <b>biodiversity.</b> Businesses have recently voiced their need to better understand their impacts to land <b>and</b> <b>biodiversity,</b> which has, in part {{led to the development of}} a few land use <b>and</b> <b>biodiversity</b> footprinting methodologies. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Society for Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) launched an International Life Cycle Inventory that incorporates impacts to land use <b>and</b> <b>biodiversity.</b> These works, among others, will be thoroughly reviewed and piloted for this group project, which will focus on supply chain footprinting for Patagonia.

Assessing impacts to land use <b>and</b> <b>biodiversity</b> across Patagonia’s product life cycles is important for understanding and addressing environmental and societal impacts on the communities where our goods are made. 4.
