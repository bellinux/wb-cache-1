Shipping {{moves over}} 80 % of the world’s commodities and transfers approximately 3 to 5 {{billion tons of}} ballast water internationally each year {{that is necessary to}} provides ships’ trimming and stability. Many studies signified {{in different parts of the}} world have shown that ships’ ballast water has very important role for the transfer aquatic organism, human pathogens, including bacteria and viruses. Therefore, the marine environment is at risk to happen a serious ecological problem during discharging ballast water. The introduction of marine invasive species to coastal waters when ships take on ballast water at one port and then discharge with water, sediments, and biofilms from ships’ ballast water tanks it at other, ports is a significant threat to coastal and ocean ecosystems and economies. And, impacts on human and animal health, the environment and socio-economic activities appear. For example, the European zebra mussel has infested over 40 % of internal waterways in United States. In 2004, with ‘International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments’ is adopted by International Maritime Organization, that describes D- 1 standard for ballast water exchange, D- 2 standard for ballast water performance, including the safety, testing requirements and procedures together with exceptional cases. Complying with the new ballast regulations is one of the most significant cost challenges the shipping industry can except to face over the next few years. According to the Ballast Water Management convention, D- 2 standard must be provided for the ballast water capacity less than 1500 m 3 (built from 2009) and the ballast water capacity greater than 5000 m 3 (built from 2012) until the end of 2016 and the ballast water capacity between 1500 – 5000 m 3 (built from 2009) until the end of 2014. For this reason, all parties have been researching alternative systems as per International Maritime Organization regulations. This study describes ballast water treatment systems together with ballast water and invasive species description. The ballast water treatment technology used to treat ballast water has generally been derived from other treatment systems, in which forms of solid-liquid separation and disinfection processes were applied. There are three treatment technology types, which are generally combined that are mechanical, chemical and disinfection. Most systems employ a two-stage approach involving mechanical separation at the first stage, followed by a second stage physical or chemical treatment. At this stage some systems use a combination of two or more treatments. In this study summarizes some systems which were approved or designed and tested. Chemical treatment use active substances to treat microorganisms, and for this, sufficient stocks will have to be carried on board. Therefore, this treatment would not be preferred by shipowners due to producing by-products with their chemical reactions to cause environmental threat. There are so many treatment systems on the market. The existing vessels can be integrated and retrofitted with these systems. Following adoption of the Ballast Water Management Convention, interest in these alternatives to conventional Ballast Water Management has increased since they offer ways to avoid, or substantially reduce, the operational issues and costs of treating compartmentalized ballast water to meet the Convention’s respective D- 2 discharge standards, plus the cost of managing tank sediments. There is limited information in evaluating of these new technologies in reducing the transfer of harmful species in accordance with the goals of the Ballast Water Management Convention. This study gives informations and perspectives about intaking ballast water in the port reception facilities together with alternative methods related with the ballast water management. Ships that cannot meet this requirement for onboard ballast water treatment may be allowed to discharge ballast water to a port-based ballast water reception facility, which is generally understood to mean either a shore-based or barge-based ballast water treatment facility. This system has some disadvantages such as potential delays, sufficient space and equipment suitability. For this, in this study gives case study of port of Baltimore as an example to analyze economically and logistically port reception facilities. According to this case, port reception facility are feasible. On the other hand, technically that can be challenges. Additionally, port reception facilities evaluate in Turkey from this perspective and compared with the port of Baltimore for space situation. Some shipowners have not ballast water treatment system or, have treatment system but their system performance is not enough to discharge of ballast water at the special zones where exist a local standard. Therefore, complying with ballast water regulations, port reception facilities will be alternative solution in order to discharge ballast water. In this study gives information about waste reception facilities in Turkey to analyze challenges that can be occurred in port reception facilities. For this, when Borusan port where called 1717 vessels in 2013 is evaluated, it appears that ports need a port ballast water reception facilities which has more capacity than present waste reception facilities. Additionally, there are many concepts have been designed zero or minimal discharge (such as storm ballast, internal ballast and potable water), no ballast or continuous flow methods that are longitudinal trunks, ship buoyancy control and enhanced ballast water exchange concepts. All continuous flow systems readily exceed the performance required by the D- 1 exchange standard but this standard is to be withdrawn at the end of 2014 / 2016. In regard to other zero ballast methods that may include their high build costs and relatively large wetted surfaces when loaded. The amount will vary according to the design cargo type and capacity, cargo loading and unloading requirements and other trading factors. At the same time, solid ballast method can be alternatively used for the container vessel. As container vessels can be arranged for solid ballast with empty positioning in export and import leg on their rotation. This method would be more attractive for retrofits or new builds than modified container ships. Results of this study underline that alternative system is very crucial for removing invasive species. In the future studies, numeric analyses and assessments of port reception facilities and the other alternative systems such as ballast free and no ballast can be proposed. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2016 Deniz taşımacılığı dünya ticaretinde oldukça büyük bir öneme sahiptir. Uluslararası nakliyeciliğin % 90 'ının gemiler ile yapıldığı günümüzde, gemilerin maksimum yük ve minimum <b>balast</b> ile seyir etmeleri ekonomik olarak tercih edilse de, gemilerin güvenli seyri açısından bu mümkün değildir. Gemilerin <b>balast</b> tanklarına alınan <b>balast</b> suyu ile her gün yaklaşık 7. 000 canlı farklı bir ekosisteme taşınmaktadır. Bu canlıların bir kısmı <b>balast</b> tanklarındaki koşullara karşı dayanıklı olup, geminin sefer süresi boyunca hayatta kalabilmektedirler. Hayatta kalmayı başarabilen canlılar, kimi zaman <b>balast</b> suyu ile boşaltıldıkları ekosistemlerde varlıklarını sürdürüp, yerli türlerin varlığını tehdit edebilirler. Bu yabancı türler sadece ekosistemdeki canlılara zarar vermekle kalmaz, balıkçılığı etkileyerek ekonomik zararlara yol açabilirler, insan sağlığına zarar verebilirler ve sahillerde biyolojik kirliliğe neden olup deniz turizmini olumsuz yönde etkilerler. <b>Balast</b> tanklarındaki su ile taşınan zararlı sucul istilacı türlerin verdikleri zararların boyutlarının ciddi olduğunun farkına varılması ile, ulusal ve uluslararası düzeyde pek çok düzenleme ve çalışmalar yapılmıştır. Yapılan çalışmalar, <b>balast</b> tankları ile taşınan istilacı türlerin sorun olmalarını engellemek için, <b>balast</b> suyunun bu canlılardan arındrılmasına yönelik sistemlerin geliştirilmesini sağlamıştır.

Maritime {{transportation}} {{has significant}} importance for international trade. Today, ships carry approximately 90 {{percent of all}} global trade. For commercial concerns, it is preferred to travel with maximum cargo and minimum ballast. However, as ballast water is used to provide stability and maneuverability during voyage, travelling with minimum ballast can cause safety problems on ships. In 1800 's, solid materials such as sand, detritus and iron were usually loaded onboard {{in order to provide}} ballast. After use, these materials were discharged to water and could be able to used by other ships. But this technique was not only time consuming but also not effective. By technological progresses through the end of 1800 's, the sea water had been used as ballast. There were not segregated ballast water tanks as it is today. The water used as ballast was stored in empty cargo tanks. The remain of the cargo such as oil, iron, etc. mixed with ballast water. The mix of these remains and water could be toxic and discharging these water to the marine environment were caused environmental and health problems. After realizing these problems, in 1980 's, segregated ballast water tanks were designed and used in order to provide contamination of ballast water. However, as the ballast water became cleaner, there arrised another problems, invasive species. With ballast waters, every day more than 7. 000 different marine species are transferred to different ecosystems. The size of the organisms in ballast water varies from micrometric viruses to organisms up to thirty centimeters. The ones who can survive in ballast tank conditions are discharged at other ports within ballast water. These organisms are called as "invasive species". The introduction of invasive marine species into a new environments by ships' ballast water has been stated as one of the four greatest treats to marine ecosystems. The problems due to the invaisve species can be analyzed in three main sections; impacts on ecology, impacts on economy and impacts on health. Introducing of invasive species can cause problems on native species. The most known example of invasive species effects on environment is recorded in Grate Lakes, United States. This area has been damaged by more than 180 invasive species during years. Zebra mussels, sea lamprey, alewife etc. were introduced to lakes and spreaded, competed with native species and damaged the food chain. These invasion problem also have effects on fisheries, factories n coastal areas. The zebra mussels has spreads more than 40 percent of US waters and cost more than US$ 750 million between 1989 - 2000. Also, it is estimated that invasive species cause US$ 138 billion per year in only USA. Moreover, if the ballast water contaminated with pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae discharged into the sea, this may cause illness and death in humans. After realizing these serious problems caused by the organisms carried in ballast water, there have been conducting national and international regulations. In 2004, the IMO introduced "International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments". With these regulations, the problems caused by ballast water have attracted attentions and the companies have started to research and develop ballast water management technologies. The Convention will enter into force 12 months after ratification by 30 States, representing 35 per cent of world merchant shipping tonnage. Once entered into force, BMW convention requires all ships to use ballast water treatment systems in order to meet Ballast Water Performance Standard (Regulation D- 2). There have been introduced many different ballast water treatment methods. These methods can be mainly divided in three groups; mechanical methods, physical methods and chemical methods. The mechanical methods are filtration and cyclonic separation. With these applications, organisms bigger than 40 - 50 micron can be able to seperated from ballast water. As physical methods, there have been developed system that use heat treatment, ultra sound treatment, de-oxidizing, ultra viole and coagulation. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. In this study, these advantages and disadvantages of the methods are explained in details. There are also systems that uses oxidizing or non-oxidizing biocides. However, using there method on its own is not enough for BMW convention requires. In order to meet these requirement, usually combined systems such as mechanical + physical or mechanical + chemical are used for ballast water management. There are many companies developed new technologies and systems in order to treat ballast water. As the number of the companies and systems are a lot, shipyards and ship owners have difficulties to find the most suitable ballast water treatment system for their ship. To be able to find the suitable system, there are some factors that need to be considered by both system distributers and shipyards/ship owners. The most important point is the ship type, thus ballast capacity of the vessel. The vessels are divided into two categories in terms of their ballast capacity; high ballast dependent vessels such as bulk carriers and tankers and low ballast dependent vessels such as containerships and other vessels like chemical carriers, passenger ships, Ro/Ro etc. As the range of the ballast capacities are wide range, this can be determinant factor to choose ballast water treatment system, because many companies are powerful in certain pump capacity ranges. Also the water characteristics such as turbidity, salinity and silt content has effects on ballast water treatment. Other factors such as space, power requirement, vessel service area, health and safety requirements are investigated in details. A case study has been examined in seventh section of the study. There has been chosen two ships in order to show how to decide ballast water treatment system. Three combined systems using filtration + UV are considered for the vessels. Technical and design details are given in section 7. After comparing investment and operating costs of the system, the most suitable one is chosen for each vessel. The detailed investment and operation cost comparison is given in the related section. This part shows how a shipyard approaches choosing a ballast water treatment system for a vessel. However, once the BMW regulations enter into force, there will be many vessels that are need to be retrofitted. The system choosing period will not be that easy. In section eight, the main focus area of this study is explained. As there will be a huge work load on shipyards/system distributors to identify the most suitable system for many vessels. In this section, a model developed in Microsoft Excel to find suitable systems that can be applied to many vessels by using Key Performance Indicators (KPI). The model has two parts. In first part, there has been developed an automatic process to eliminate the unsuitable systems. The requirements set up by shipyards/ship owners are compared with the systems' data. With this process, the systems that are not meet the shipyards'/ship owners' requirements are identified. In second part, the system are compared in details. Every criterias which are stated in the study are graded from 1 to 6 and compared with each other. This process helps us to specify system points and find the most suitable system for vessel/vessels. In this study, only two vessels and three systems for each vessel are examined due to the confidentiality. Even so, the advantages of using KPI while choosing a ballast water treatment system can be easily seen from the study. In case of many system offers, in order to make better comparison, using KPI has benefits for shipyards. This study shows that KPI analyze makes system selection easy and reliable. Yüksek LisansM.

The EU is a group consisting of 27 countries from different cultural backgrounds, with different national mentalitities, economic, social and politic systems. The economical and political integration is not taking place in a spontaneous way, as a process of continuous cognition, analysis and learning from mistakes, but according to a plan comming from upper political levels and with emphasis on the aims more than on the means. In the EU there are at least 2 levels of legislature, executive and jurisdiction, each on the national and supranational level. The nature of these 2 levels is rather parallel than vertical. An important link and therefore effective feedback is missing between the supranational level and the national level represented through the vote of the population and the performance of the economic environment. Constructivistic efforts are encumbering the economy of the EU with <b>balast,</b> that can be understood as a pool of from the system arising ineffectivities. The result of this <b>balast</b> is an inhibition of the economic growth despite declarations to accelerate it. This thesis will observe these ineffectivities through a more detailed analysis of macroeconomic fields as are monetary policy, labour markets and tax systems. The emphasis will be put on concrete impacts of supranational policies on individual countries, areas inside the EU and the EU as a whole. The USA will serve as a benchmark, because the EU has the ambition to get ahead of them as the world largest economy and that by the year 2010. The nature of these ineffectivities is of a rather hidden nature and therefore I will preffer the studying of literature in fields of interest as a mean of identifying the ineffectivities rather than atual quantifications...|$|E

Material and Method: Forty eyes of 20 patients who were followed up in our contact lens section were included in this study. Refractive errors of the patients were between - 0. 50 and - 6. 0 diopters of myopia and > 0. 75 diopter of astigmatism. The patients were randomly assigned to wear Balafilcon A (Purevision Toric, Baush&Lomb) with prism <b>balast</b> toric system or spherical designed Senofilcon A (Acuvue Oasys for astigmatism, Johnson&Johnson) with accelerated stabilization toric system. We recorded and compared the visual acuity with Snellen chart, contrast sensitivity with Bailey-Lovie chart in letters, mean root mean square (RMS) of corneal aberration with by Nidek Magellan Mapper for all eyes with and without glasses and while wearing Balafilcon A or Senofilcon A toric soft contact lenses. Results: We did not observe any difference in visual acuity between contact lenses. Contrast sensitivity was increased approximately 4. 8 - 5. 4 letters with contact lenses. Total higher order aberrations of mean RMS values were 0. 42 ± 0. 14 µm without contact lens, 0. 37 ± 0. 23 µm with Balafilcon A lens, 0. 43 ± 0. 15 µm with Senofilcon A (p= 0. 507). Trefoil values were significantly higher with Senofilcon A lenses when compared to Balafilcon A lenses. There was no statistically significant difference for other measured higher order aberrations. Discussion: High and low contrast vision values were adequate in both contact lens groups. There was a non-significant decrease in total higher order aberration values with aspheric design contact lenses when compared to spherical designs. Although there were differences in aberrations related to lens designs, they did not have significant effect on visual quality. (Turk J Ophthalmol 2013; 43 : 253 - 7...|$|E

The following results are obtained: Correlations between protein and butter fat in accordance with milkings and lactations ranged from r = 0, 009 to + 0, 079. These coefficients are not statistically significant. In other words there were no correlations found between protein and buttersfat content in milk. Therefore the present knowledge that concerns this problem should be corrected. Correlations between protein and dry matter content in accordance with the milkings and lactations is low and it is ranged from r = + 0, 172 to + 0, 307. These are highly statistically significant (P< 0. 01). Vice versa, the correlations between butter fat and dry matter content are high both, in accordance with milkings and lactations and are ranged from r = 0, 671 to + 0, 793. These coefficients are, by all means highly statistically significant (P< 0. 01). Correlations between protein and specific weight of milk in accordance with milkings and lactations prove to be low, ranging from r = (+ 0, 258 to + 0, 391. Coefficients are highly significant. Correlations between butter fat and specific weight is slightly negative and ranged from r = 0, 104 to 0, 346. These coefficients are significant (P< 0. 05) and highly significant (P< 0. 01). Correlations between dry matter content and specific weight of milk in accordance with milkings and lactations are low and ranged from r = 0, 005 to + 0, 342. These coefficients for the first lactation are not significant, while for the next two lactations are highly significant (P< 0. 01) ...|$|E
