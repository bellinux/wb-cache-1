5|$|In the mid-1850s, {{he joined}} James W.C. Pennington and other <b>black</b> <b>leaders</b> in {{establishing}} the Legal Rights Association (LRA) in New York City. A pioneering minority-rights association, the LRA waged a nearly ten-year campaign against segregated public transportation in New York City. This organization successfully defeated segregation in New York {{and served as a}} model for later rights organizations, including the National Equal Rights League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).|$|E
5|$|The administration's {{response}} to racial violence was minimal, {{causing him to}} lose black support. When black postmasters at Hogansville, Georgia in 1897, and at Lake City, South Carolina the following year, were assaulted, McKinley issued no statement of condemnation. Although <b>black</b> <b>leaders</b> criticized McKinley for inaction, supporters responded by saying there was little the president could do to intervene. Critics replied by saying that he could at least publicly condemn such events, as Harrison had done.|$|E
5|$|Du Bois {{traveled}} to Europe in 1921 {{to attend the}} second Pan-African Congress. The assembled <b>black</b> <b>leaders</b> {{from around the world}} issued the London Resolutions and established a Pan-African Association headquarters in Paris. Under Du Bois's guidance, the resolutions insisted on racial equality, and that Africa be ruled by Africans (not, as in the 1919 congress, with the consent of Africans). Du Bois restated the resolutions of the congress in his Manifesto To the League of Nations, which implored the newly formed League of Nations to address labor issues and to appoint Africans to key posts. The League took little action on the requests.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine racial biases, {{particularly}} those against Asian Americans in leadership positions, and the intersection of race, leadership, and impression formation. Ninety participants were presented a photo and vignette of either a hypothetical Asian American <b>leader,</b> <b>Black</b> <b>leader,</b> or White leader. Participants then proceeded to answer questions probing their impressions of the leaders, such as perceived competence. Contrary to the hypothesis that the White leader would receive the most favorable ratings across all dependent variables, the findings illustrated that the White leader only scored higher on perceived friendliness than the <b>Black</b> <b>leader</b> and the Asian American leader. Additionally, the Asian American leader did not receive higher ratings than the <b>Black</b> <b>leader</b> on perceived friendliness, perceived competence, and perceived legitimacy, thus showing no support for the hypothesis that the Asian American leader would score higher on all three variables than the <b>Black</b> <b>leader.</b> Lastly, the <b>Black</b> <b>leader</b> did not receive higher ratings than the Asian American leader on charismatic leadership and willingness to follow, contrary to the hypothesis that the <b>Black</b> <b>leader</b> would score higher than the Asian American leader on both variables. Overall, the findings showed partial support for the first hypothesis and no support for the second and third hypotheses. Implications for reducing racial biases and promoting inclusion in the workplace are discussed...|$|R
5|$|In mid-1967, New York City mayor John Lindsay {{sought to}} develop closer ties {{with leaders of}} impoverished neighborhoods. Prompted in part by {{concerns}} voiced by the New York Police Department (NYPD), the mayor dispatched one of his aides, Barry Gottehrer, to meet with Clarence13X. Belying his fearsome reputation, Clarence13X had a congenial meeting with Gottehrer, during which he requested more bus routes and school funding. Clarence13X subsequently attended a meeting of <b>black</b> <b>leaders</b> at Gracie Mansion, the mayor's official residence. The city provided buses for Five Percenters to travel to a Long Island park, and {{with help from the}} National Urban League, obtained an abandoned storefront for use as a school. It became known as the Allah School in Mecca and aimed to prepare young people for college preparatory schools. Tensions soon formed between the Five Percenters and the school's overseers; Clarence13X desired more control over the curriculum and had difficulty finding qualified teachers. Police regularly visited the school to ensure that the students were not being radicalized. In 1975, Gottehrer chronicled his friendship with Clarence13X in The Mayor's Man. The book was well received by some Five Percenters, who republished portions of it after it went out of print. They have not reprinted the entire book, owing to a passage in which Gottehrer relates that Clarence13X offered to allow him to sleep with his teenage daughter.|$|E

5000|$|The term B-roll {{originates}} from {{a particular}} {{solution to the problem}} of visible splices in the narrow film stock used in 16 mm film. 35 mm film was wide enough to hide splices, but 16 mm film revealed the splices as flaws in the picture. To avoid this problem, the intended shots were spliced to opaque <b>black</b> <b>leader,</b> with the <b>black</b> <b>leader</b> hiding the splice. Two sequences of shots were assembled, the odd-numbered shots on the A-roll, and the even-numbered shots on the B-roll, such that all of the shots on one roll were matched by <b>black</b> <b>leader</b> on the other roll, in a checkerboard pattern (an alternate name for the process was [...] "checkerboard printing".) Unexposed 16 mm raw print stock was exposed twice, once to the A-roll, then it was exposed again to the B-roll.|$|R
