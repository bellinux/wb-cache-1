Interpretation of the structure of the Compton line. —The diffuse structure of the Compton line is here attributed to a broadening caused by the velocity distribution of the scattering electrons in the solid scatterer analagous to a Doppler broadening and a relation between line structure and velocity distribution is derived. The observed line structure from the beryllium scatterer is compared with theoretical structures computed on several alternative assumptions as to electron velocity distribution. It is assumed: — 1. That electrons in the solid scattering substance have the velocity distribution required by a wave-mechanical atom model for a free atom of that substance far removed from neighbors. 2. That electrons may be divided into two classes, one class the metallic or conductive electrons in the state of a degenerate electron gas subject to the Pauli Exclusion Principle and having the velocity distribution derived by Sommerfeld, and the other class as in the 1 st assumption unperturbed by the neighboring atoms. 3. That electrons may be divided into two classes as before but that those forming an electron gas have the classical velocity distribution required by the Maxwell-Boltzmann equipartition law. 4. That electrons have the velocity distribution required by the older <b>Bohr-Sommerfeld</b> atom <b>model</b> with point electrons executing Kepler orbits and as in the first assumption unperturbed by neighboring atoms. The distribution of electron velocities in metals. —The results strongly contradict the classical distribution of electron velocities in solid bodies predicted by the rigid interpretation of the Maxwell-Boltzmann equipartition principle.

40|$|The old {{quantum theory}} of Bohr and Sommerfeld was {{abandonned}} {{for the wrong}} reason. Its contradictions were caused not by the orbit concept but by a mental barrier [...] the inconceivability that an electron might collide with the atomic nucleus. Removing that barrier resolves the theory's main failures [...] incorrect orbital momenta, He atom, H 2 + molecule ion. The inclusion of electron oscillations through the nucleus [...] a concept called "Coulomb oscillator" [...] renders the old quantum theory consistent with quantum mechanics (although devoid of wave character). The triple success of the <b>Bohr-Sommerfeld</b> <b>model</b> is its correct description of the H atom (and one-electron ions) concerning (1) the energy levels Enl, (2) the orbital angular momenta Lnl [...] if corrected as Lnl^ 2 = l(l+ 1) hbar^ 2 and with the Coulomb oscillator included [...] and (3) the orbits' space quantization [...] with (Lnl) z = ml hbar. These achievements are succinctly represented by the principal, angular and magnetic quantum numbers (n, l, ml) and visualized by orbital ellipse geometry [...] major axis, vertex curvature, and tilt angle, respectively. Orbit geometry also accounts for the average orbit size. Moreover, the Coulomb oscillator provides a natural explanation of (isotropic) hyperfine interaction. The shortcomings of the old quantum theory lie in its neglect of three properties of particles [...] their spin, their wave nature and their quantum statistics. These deficiencies notwithstanding, the visual appeal of the <b>Bohr-Sommerfeld</b> <b>model</b> remains a pedagogical asset to complement the abstract character of quantum mechanics.

40|$|A theory’s {{fertility}} {{is one of}} {{the standard}} theoretical virtues. But how is it to be construed? In current philosophical discourse, particularly in the realism debate, theoretical fertility is usually understood in terms of novel success: a theory is fertile if it manages to make successful novel predictions. Another, more permissible, notion of fertility {{can be found in the}} work of Ernan McMullin. This kind of fertility, McMullin claims, gives us just as strong (or even stronger) grounds for realism. My paper critically assesses McMullin’s notion of fertility and its realist rationale. It concludes that McMullin’s preferred example, namely the fertile development of the <b>Bohr-Sommerfeld</b> <b>model</b> of the atom, does not support McMullin’s argument for realism.

He graduated in civil engineering from the School of Engineering of the Rio the Janeiro, one of the traditional engineering schools of Latin America. It was founded in 1792 as a military school, soon after the arrival in Brazil of the Portuguese Court. He obtained the Doctoral Degree in Physical and Mathematical Sciences and his thesis was entitled “Sobre funções de variáveis reais” (On Functions of Real Variables). Theodoro Ramos assisted the Organizing Committee that established the University of São Paulo – USP. This Committee was nominated by the governor of São Paulo Armando Oliveira Salles (1887 - 1945). Theodoro A. Ramos was the firs Dean of the Faculty ofPhilosophy, Sciences and Letters of the University of São Paulo(USP), an institution conceived to be a great center of basic scientific research and education. This faculty served as the foundation upon which all the science institutes of USP today were built.
