50|$|On 5 June 2008, the South Korean Supreme Court {{confirmed}} that the charge was <b>barred</b> <b>by</b> <b>limitation.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2001, a {{local court}} ordered the South Korean {{government}} to pay reparations to the victims' families. On 18 May 2004, a general {{court ruled that}} a charge of massacre against the South Korean governmental was <b>barred</b> <b>by</b> <b>limitation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Justice William Young {{also held}} that the appellants' claim that Native Land Court titles to {{riparian}} blocks included the riverbed to its midpoint was [...] "at least doubtful". However William Young J also {{held that the}} appellants could not rely on the rules of equity to have the riverbed placed in a constructive trust or partially rescinded. Furthermore, William Young J held that the appellants' claims were <b>barred</b> <b>by</b> <b>limitation</b> statutes and also the Crown's defence of laches and acquiescence was made out.|$|E
25|$|A {{judgment}} for defendant {{that the prosecution}} is <b>barred</b> <b>by</b> <b>limitations</b> goes to his liability in substantive law; and, in whatever form the issue was raised, such a judgment may be interposed as a conclusive bar to another prosecution for the same offense.|$|R
40|$|The Court {{held that}} under NRCP 41 (e) a {{complaint}} in intervention {{is a part}} of an original action, and thus, the district court’s dismissal of appellant’s complaint was mandatory. However, the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the complaint with prejudice because the district court mischaracterized NRS 116. 3116 (6) as a statute of limitations when it only limits the amount of actionable unpaid HOA assessments. Finally, the Court found that appellant’s subsequent action would not be <b>barred</b> <b>by</b> statute of <b>limitations...</b>|$|R
50|$|In May 2010, the Grand Chamber ruled, by 14 {{votes to}} 3, {{that the case}} {{presented}} no violation of Article 7 ECHR. Under the Hague Regulations of 1907, the court determined Kononov could be punished for failing to meet the regulation criteria, specifically, wearing German Wehrmacht uniforms while carrying out the crimes. The court determined {{the execution of the}} villagers was in violation of established international law at the time, as Kononov was only entitled to arrest them, and his conviction was not <b>barred</b> <b>by</b> statute of <b>limitations.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 17 May 2001, Kononov {{was once}} again charged by the prosecutor's office {{following}} a new investigation. The deaths of six men were deemed justifiable, but {{the deaths of the}} three women were deemed an act of banditry, in violation of the law, but ultimately <b>barred</b> <b>by</b> statute of <b>limitations.</b> The prosecution appealed and on 30 April 2004, the decision of the lower court was overturned and Kononov was found guilty of war crimes, and subsequently jailed. On 28 September 2004, the Supreme Court upheld the verdict of the court in dismissing Kononov's appeal.|$|R
50|$|On 26 June 2006, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Korea {{concluded}} that the massacre was committed by the South Korean Army. However, a South Korean local court decided that charging the South Korean government with the massacre was <b>barred</b> <b>by</b> statute of <b>limitations,</b> as the five-year prescription ended in December 1954. On 10 February 2009, the South Korean high court also dismissed the victim's family complaint. In June 2011, the Supreme Court of South Korea decided that the South Korean government should compensate victims of the inhumane crimes it had committed regardless of the deadline to make the claim.|$|R
5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of equitable tolling {{was developed to}} permit under certain circumstances the filing of a lawsuit that otherwise would be <b>barred</b> <b>by</b> a <b>limitations</b> period. See Bailey v. Glover, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 342, 22 L.Ed. 636 (1874). The tolling doctrine {{is used in the}} interests of justice to accommodate both a defendant's right not to be called upon to defend a stale claim and a plaintiff's right to assert a meritorious claim when equitable circumstances have prevented a timely filing. Equitable tolling is a type of equitable modification which “‘focuses on the plaintiff's excusable ignorance of the limitations period and on the lack of prejudice to the defendant.'” Cocke v. Merrill Lynch & Co., 817 F.2d 1559, 1561 (11th Cir.1987) (quoting Naton v. Bank of California, 649 F.2d 691, 696 (9th Cir.1981)). Contrary to the analysis of the majority below, equitable tolling, unlike estoppel, does not require active deception or employer misconduct, but focuses rather on the employee with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the responsiveness of the system of sanctions applicable to broadcasting concessionaires in Brazil. Methodology/approach/design – The research considered the theory of responsive regulation proposed by Ayres and Braithwaite as parameter for the critical analysis of the Brazilian broadcasting regulatory system of sanctions. Findings – The research concluded that the system of sanctions does not encourage concessionaires to comply with its legal, contractual and regulatory obligations, as penalties do not promote dialogue between regulator and regulated firms. There are legal obstacles for the application of the maximum penalty of revocation of concession, and some fines imposed on concessionaires in the past could not be collected as they were <b>barred</b> <b>by</b> statute of <b>limitations.</b> Practical implications – The findings of this research may be considered by Brazilian regulators on the development of a more responsive and effective system of sanctions for broadcasting. Originality/value (optional) – The research introduces the discussion on responsiveness regarding the Brazilian broadcasting regulatory model...|$|R
