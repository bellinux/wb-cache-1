50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1960s, the first tests for the manufacture of steel cord were undertaken. The company wanted to include tyre reinforcement material in its <b>product</b> <b>range.</b> A large-scale production was established in Oberbruch in 1969 which Akzo ceased again in 1991 for reason of international competition and establishment of tyre manufacturers' own capacities.In {{the second half of the}} 1960s, the number of employees reached a peak of 7,088. Glanzstoff remained a world leader in the production of man made fibers and their <b>basic</b> <b>products</b> up to the 1970s.|$|R
30|$|Consumer {{products}} can be segmented into {{two different types}} of products regarding their demand patterns: <b>basic</b> or functional <b>products</b> and fashion or innovative products (Fisher & Rajaram 2000). <b>Basic</b> <b>products</b> have a long life-cycle and stable demand, which is easy to forecast with standard methods. Fashion products on the other hand have a short life-cycle and highly unpredictable demand. Due to their short life-cycles fashion products are often bought just once prior to a selling period (and not reordered after demand occurred which is usually the case for <b>basic</b> <b>products)</b> which makes them hard to forecast. Fashion products thus need different forecasting methods than <b>basic</b> <b>products.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a two-dimensional spatial framework {{to explore the}} firms' optimal locations and optimal attributes of <b>basic</b> <b>products</b> under linear transportation costs, in which firms have the technique of flexible manufacturing and engage in spatially discriminatory pricing. We can observe {{in the real world}} that the technique of flexible manufacturing has been widely adopted by most major manufacturing industries. As indicated by Eaton and Schmitt (1994), the key feature of flexible manufacturing is economies of scope, which can be represented by the production of an array of differentiated products extended by a <b>basic</b> <b>product</b> using the same manufacturing process. The production of the <b>basic</b> <b>product</b> incurs a sunk cost of product development, whose feature can be described by a point on Hotelling's attribute line. This <b>basic</b> <b>product</b> can be modified to produce extended variant products by incurring additional costs. The additional cost of producing an extended variant product is denoted by a per-unit modification cost that is proportional to the distance of the attribute line between the attribute addresses of the <b>basic</b> <b>product</b> and the extended variant product. The game in question is a three-stage game. Firms simultaneously select their equilibrium locations in the first stage. Then, they simultaneously choose the optimal attributes of the <b>basic</b> <b>products</b> in the second stage. Finally, firms engage in spatially discriminatory pricing in the third stage. The main findings of the paper are as follows. First of all, we show that the two firms will agglomerate {{at the center of the}} location line and the optimal attributes of the two <b>basic</b> <b>products</b> will be located at the first and third quartiles of the attribute line, respectively, when the ratio of the marginal modification rate to the transport rate is high. Secondly, the two firms will locate separately on the location line and the optimal attributes of the two <b>basic</b> <b>products</b> will remain at the first and third quartiles when this ratio is moderate. Moreover, the two firms will locate at the first and third quartiles of the location line, respectively, and the optimal attributes of the <b>basic</b> <b>products</b> will agglomerate at the center of the attribute line when this ratio is low...|$|R

40|$|During {{this decade}} forest {{companies}} have been diversifying their operations and <b>product</b> <b>ranges</b> from traditional forestry, timber and pulp and paper both to energy and biofuels and to RFID technologies, labels, wood and plastic composites, and biochemicals. <b>Basic</b> <b>products</b> and high tech products are developed side by side. Each company desires new profitable products {{in order to survive}} and prosper in the fast changing markets. In this rat race environmental, socio-cultural and economic sustainability issues have been pushed aside. The sustainability card is laid on the table only to promote the products. Both the already known and potential unsustainable impacts are hidden under the table. Yet there is a huge variety of sustainability lacks in the products and operations of these companies. This paper examines the environmental, socio-cultural and economic sustainability lacks of three major European forest product companies in their business areas of forests, timber, pulp and paper, biofuels, energy, labels, RFID tags, wood plastic composites and biochemicals - and suggests sustainable solutions to the indentified lacks...|$|R
