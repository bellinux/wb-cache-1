For a d-dimensional cylinder H whose base is a (d− 1) -dimensional convex body K, we obtain a lower bound and an upper bound of its <b>blocking</b> <b>number</b> {{in terms of the}} Hadwiger covering <b>number</b> and the <b>blocking</b> <b>number</b> of K respectively. Moreover, we introduce and study the fixing number of a convex body, we determine the exact lower and upper bounds of fixing numbers for all d-dimensional convex bodies...|$|R

500|$|According to Palmer, songwriters {{adapted the}} phrase for other artists {{and it was}} [...] "soon absorbed into the lingua franca of blues, jazz, and rock and roll".

[...] "Trouble", another Leiber and Stoller composition that uses the riff, was sung by Elvis Presley in the 1958 musical drama film King Creole. [...] American composer Elmer Bernstein quoted the figure in another film, The Man with the Golden Arm, which received a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Original Score in 1955.

30|$|In Fig.  5, it {{also can}} be seen that, when the <b>blocking</b> <b>number</b> is too small, each {{subimage}} will be bigger in size, {{as a result this}} method can not display the strength of being insensitive to position and illumination changes; when the <b>blocking</b> <b>number</b> is too big, on the contrary, each subimage will be much smaller, which will damage the global structure information of the palmprint image, resulting in the decreasing of recognition rate. Therefore, one should select appropriate <b>blocking</b> <b>number</b> and feature dimension based on different degradations of palmprint image when utilizing B(2 D)^ 2 PCA to extract feature vectors.|$|R
40|$|Let K be a {{convex body}} in R^n. We {{say that a}} set of {{translates}} { K + u_i }_i= 1 ^p block K if any other translate of K which touches K, overlaps one of K + u_i, i = 1,..., p. The smallest number of non-overlapping translates (i. e. whose interiors are disjoint) of K, all of which touch K at its boundary and which block any other translate of K from touching K is called the <b>Blocking</b> <b>Number</b> of K and denote it by B(K). This thesis explores {{the properties of the}} <b>blocking</b> <b>number</b> in general but the main purpose is to study the unrestricted <b>blocking</b> <b>number</b> B_α(K), i. e., when K is blocked by translates of α K, where α is a fixed positive number and when the restrictions that the translates are non-overlapping or touch K are removed. We call this <b>number</b> the Unrestricted <b>Blocking</b> <b>Number</b> and denote it by B_α(K). The original motivation for <b>blocking</b> <b>number</b> is the following famous problem: Can a rigid material sphere be brought into contact with 13 other such spheres of the same size? This problem was posed by Kepler in 1611. Although this problem was raised by Kepler, it is named after Newton since Newton and Gregory had a dispute over the solution which was eventually settled in Newton’s favour. It is called the Newton Number, N(K) of K and is defined to be the maximum number of non-overlapping translates of K which can touch K at its boundary. The well-known dispute between Sir Isaac Newton and David Gregory concerning this problem, which Newton conjectured to be 12, and Gregory thought to be 13, was ended 180 years later. In 1874, the problem was solved by Hoppe in favour of Newton, i. e., N(β^ 3) = 12. In his proof, the arrangement of 12 unit balls is not unique. This is thought to explain why the problem took 180 years to solve although it is a very natural and a very simple sounding problem. As a generalization of the Newton Number to other convex bodies the <b>blocking</b> <b>number</b> was introduced by C. Zong in 1993. “Another characteristic of mathematical thought is that it can have no success where it cannot generalize. ” C. S. Pierce As quoted above, in mathematics generalizations play a very important part. In this thesis we generalize the <b>blocking</b> <b>number</b> to the Unrestricted <b>Blocking</b> <b>Number.</b> Furthermore; we also define the <b>Blocking</b> <b>Number</b> with negative copies and denote it by B_(K). The <b>blocking</b> <b>number</b> not only gives rise {{to a wide variety of}} generalizations but also it has interesting observations in nature. For instance, there is a direct relation to the distribution of holes on the surface of pollen grains with the unrestricted <b>blocking</b> <b>number.</b> ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{original}} protocol has {{a transfer}} file size limit of 512 bytes/block x 65535 blocks = 32MB. In 1998 this limit {{was extended to}} 65535 bytes/block x 65535 blocks = 4GB by TFTP Blocksize Option RFC 2348. If the defined blocksize produces an IP packet size that exceeds the minimum MTU at any point of the network path, IP fragmentation and reassembly will occur not only adding more overhead but also leading to total transfer failure when the minimalist IP stack implementation in a host's BOOTP or PXE ROM does not (or fails to properly) implement IP fragmentation and reassembly [...] If TFTP packets should be kept within the standard Ethernet MTU (1500), the blocksize value is calculated as 1500 minus headers of TFTP (4 bytes), UDP (8 bytes) and IP (20 bytes) = 1468 bytes/block, this gives a limit of 1468 bytes/block x 65535 blocks = 92MB.
