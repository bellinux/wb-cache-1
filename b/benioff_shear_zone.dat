40|$|Surface rupturing {{during the}} 28 June 1992, Landers, California earthquake, east of Los Angeles, {{accommodated}} right-lateral offsets {{up to about}} 6 m along segments of distinct, en echelon fault zones with a total length of about 80 km. The offsets were accommodated generally not by faults [...] distinct slip surfaces [...] but rather by <b>shear</b> <b>zones,</b> tabular bands of localized shearing. In long, straight stretches of fault zones at Landers the rupture is characterized by telescoping of <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> and intensification of shearing: broad <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> of mild <b>shearing,</b> containing narrow <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> of more intense shearing, containing even-narrower <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> of very intense shearing, which may contain a fault. Thus the ground ruptured across broad belts of shearing with subparallel walls, oriented NW. Each broad belt consists of a broad <b>zone</b> of mild <b>shearing,</b> extending across its entire width (50 to 200 m), and much narrower (a few m wide) <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> that accommodate most of the offset of the belt and are portrayed by en echelon tension cracks. In response to right-lateral shearing, the slices of ground bounded by the tension cracks rotated in a clockwise sense, producing left lateral shearing, and the slices were forced against {{the walls of the}} <b>shear</b> <b>zone,</b> producing thrusting. Even narrower <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> formed within the narrow <b>shear</b> <b>zones,</b> and some of these were faults. Although the narrower <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> probably are indicators to right-lateral fault segments at depth, the surface rupturing during the earthquake is characterized not by faulting, but by <b>zones</b> of <b>shearing</b> at various scales. Furthermore, understanding of the formation of the <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> may be critical to understanding of earthquake faulting because, where faulting is associated with the formation of a <b>shear</b> <b>zone,</b> the faulting occurs late {{in the development of the}} <b>shear</b> <b>zone.</b> The faulting occurs after a <b>shear</b> <b>zone</b> or a belt of <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> forms...|$|R

40|$|A crustal-scale <b>shear</b> <b>zone</b> network at {{the fossil}} brittle-to-viscous {{transition}} exposed at Cap de Creus, NE Spain evolved by coeval fracturing and viscous, mylonitic overprinting {{of an existing}} foliation. Initial fracturing led to mylonitic shearing as rock softened in ductilely deformed zones surrounding the fractures. Mylonitic <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> widened by lateral branching of fractures from these <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> and by synthetic rotation of the existing foliation between the fractures and <b>shear</b> <b>zones.</b> <b>Shear</b> <b>zones</b> lengthened {{by a combination of}} fracturing and mylonitic shearing in front of the <b>shear</b> <b>zone</b> tips. <b>Shear</b> <b>zones</b> interconnected along and across their shearing planes, separating rhomb-shaped lozenges of less deformed rock. Lozenges were subsequently incorporated into the mylonitic <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> by widening in the manner described above. In this way, deformation became homogeneous on the scale of initial fracturing (metre- to decametre-scale). In contrast, the <b>shear</b> <b>zone</b> network represents localisation of strain on a decametre-length scale. The strength of the continental crust at the time of coeval fracturing and viscous shearing is inferred to have decreased with time and strain, as fracturing evolved to mylonitic shearing, and as the <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> coalesced to form a through-going network subparallel to the shearing plane. Crustal strength must therefore be considered as strain- and scale-dependent...|$|R

A transition between the different types occurs along strike over short distances. Discontinuous <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> are also localized on pegmatite dykes and quartz veins, and both (i) and (ii) are discontinuously outlined by quartz layers. Detailed surface mapping reveals that most fault-like <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> are arranged en-échelon, mainly forming contractional steps.

Detailed petrographic observations of the Zazafotsy <b>shear</b> <b>zone</b> show that a strong magnetic signal is correlated with metamorphic reactions and especially with biotite breakdown to peritectic phases such as orthopyroxene and iron-rich oxides (metamorphic charnockitization).

The kinematics of individual <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> depends on the orientation of the original heterogeneities (acting as nucleation planes) and by partitioning of strain components at the kilometre-scale with concentration of the flattening component to the Piantonetto low-strain domain.

Hydrothermal muscovite is slightly more aluminous (1 – 2 wt%) than metamorphic muscovite in both <b>shear</b> <b>zones.</b> HMSZ muscovite averages > 900 ppm N, in contrast to metamorphic muscovite that averages c. 200 ppm N. In both <b>shear</b> <b>zones,</b> rutile has replaced metamorphic titanite and epidote has altered to carbonate and phyllosilicates, but these reactions were nearly isochemical. Structurally controlled hydrothermal graphite in the HMSZ occurs in microshears (up to 3 wt%, above background < 0. 2 wt%). Alteration in the Rise & Shine <b>Shear</b> <b>Zone</b> (RSSZ) was accompanied by addition of abundant ankerite. The two <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> have subtly different geochemical signatures and are not directly genetically related. However, As enrichment is a key exploration target for both <b>shear</b> <b>zones.</b> <br/...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe thermal {{evolution}} around <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> {{is controlled}} by three major thermal processes: diffusion, advection and shear heating. We present a dimensional analysis to quantify, to first-order, the relative contributions of these three processes to the thermal evolution around lithospheric-scale <b>shear</b> <b>zones.</b> We consider eleven parameters that control the kinematics, the three-dimensional (3 -D) geometry, the initial thermal structure and the average strength of the <b>shear</b> <b>zone.</b> Three dimensionless parameters are presented to quantify the relative contributions of the three thermal processes. We validate the dimensional analysis with 2 -D thermo-kinematic numerical models. The applicability of the dimensional analysis {{to any kind of}} <b>shear</b> <b>zone</b> (i. e., thrust, normal-slip and strike-slip <b>shear</b> <b>zones)</b> makes it a useful tool that is complementary to previous numerical and analytical studies. Finally, thrust-type <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> are used to illustrate how the three thermal processes control the thermal evolutio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Three {{dimensional}} finite {{strain and}} kinematic {{data from the}} Resolution Island <b>Shear</b> <b>Zone,</b> Fiordland, New Zealand record the progressive evolution of a lower crustal metamorphic core complex. The Resolution Island <b>Shear</b> <b>Zone</b> is a mid-Cretaceous (~ 114 - 90 Ma) extensional <b>shear</b> <b>zone</b> that juxtaposes high-pressure (P~ 17 - 19 kbar) garnet-granulite and eclogite facies orthogneiss from the lower crust against mid-crustal (P~ 6 - 8 kbar) orthogneiss and paragneiss along a low-angle upper amphibolite facies ductile normal fault. In the lower plate of the Resolution Island <b>Shear</b> <b>Zone</b> the high-pressure garnetgranulite and eclogite facies gneissic foliations (S 1) are attenuated by granulite facies extensional <b>shear</b> <b>zone</b> foliations (S 2). Retrograde metamorphism marked by the breakdown of omphacite and garnet to amphibole and feldspar in S 2 foliation records the unloading of the lower plate during extension. Continued extension localized strain into weaker amphibole and feldspar-bearing lithologies. Upper amphibolite facies <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> anastomose around rigid lenses that preserve the S 1 and S 2 fabric. Upper amphibolite facies <b>shear</b> <b>zone</b> fabrics (S 3 /L 3) that envelop these pods display a regional-scale domeand- basin pattern. These <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> coalesce and form the Resolution Island <b>Shear</b> <b>Zone.</b> Coeval {{with the formation of}} the Resolution Island <b>Shear</b> <b>Zone,</b> a conjugate, southwest dipping, and lesser magnitude <b>shear</b> <b>zone</b> termed the Wet Jacket <b>Shear</b> <b>Zone</b> developed in the upper plate of the Resolution Island <b>Shear</b> <b>Zone.</b> Three-dimensional strain analyses from S 3 /L 3 fabric in the Resolution Island <b>Shear</b> <b>Zone</b> show prolate-shaped strain ellipsoids. Stretching axes (X) from measured finite strain ellipsoids trend northeast and southwest and are subparallel to L 3 mineral stretching lineations. Shortening axes (Y, Z) are subhorizontal and subvertical, respectively, and rotate through the YZ plane of the finite strain ellipsoid. This pattern reflects the dome-and-basin geometry displayed by anastomosing S 3 foliations and indicates the Resolution Island <b>Shear</b> <b>Zone</b> developed in the field of constriction. Threedimensional kinematic results indicate a coaxial-dominated rotation of stretching lineations toward the X-axis in both the XZ and XY planes of the finite strain ellipsoid. Results suggest that a lower crustal metamorphic core complex developed in a constrictional strain field with components of coaxial-dominated subvertical and subhorizontal shortening. Mid-Cretaceous (~ 114 - 90 Ma) extensional structures exposed in Fiordland, including the Resolution Island, Wet Jacket, Mount Irene and Doubtful Sound <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> and the Paparoa metamorphic core complex allows the reconstruction of a crustal column that describes the geometry of mid-Cretaceous continental rifting of Gondwana. The overall symmetry of crustal-scale structures during continental extension suggests kinematic links between flow in the lower crust and the geometry and mode of continental extension. This result is consistent with numerical models of lithospheric rifting that predict the lower crust has a primary control on the style of continental extension...|$|R
40|$|International {{audience}} 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating of syn-kinematic white mica (phengite) and biotite is used {{to constrain}} the age of <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> within the granodiorites of the Grimsel Pass area (Aar Massif, Central Alps). Three sets of steeply dipping <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> have been mapped. Stage 1 <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> are very broad (200 m wide) zones of biotite-bearing rocks, with a progressive increase in intensity of ductile deformation from rim to core, and have dip-slip kinematics. Subsequent Stage 2 <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> are narrower, contain phengite-rich mylonites, and show a gradual change from dextral strike-slip to dip-slip kinematics across strike. Strain localisation during the formation of Stage 2 <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> is interpreted to have been aided by reaction-weakening during extensive fluid–rock interaction. Brittle precursors of Stage 2 <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> are marked by biotite-rich cataclasites preserved along the northern contact of the overprinting main Stage 2 <b>shear</b> <b>zone.</b> Biotite from a Stage 1 <b>shear</b> <b>zone</b> yields an age of 21. 1 ± 0. 2 Ma. Phengites in Stage 2 mylonites in the Grimsel Pass area have a very narrow age range (13. 8 – 12. 2 Ma), which is interpreted to bracket the duration of ductile deformation during Stage 2 deformation at mid-crustal levels. However, the biotite-rich cataclasites at the margin of a Stage 2 <b>shear</b> <b>zone</b> may have localised fluid flow up to 2 Ma prior to the onset of main Stage 2 ductile deformation. Stage 3 <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> are brittle strike-slip faults containing cataclasites, breccias and clay fault gouges. Earlier studies have established that these late faults formed at < 9 Ma and were active until at least 3 Ma...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the genesis}} of transpressive {{structures}} is important to modern structural geology because of the ubiquitous occurrence of transpression along plate margins. A key question is how strain partitioning occurs in regions of transpression. We report on a sequence of supercrustal and plutonic rocks from the western Coast Plutonic Complex exposed along Grenville Channel. Grenville Channel is a major topographic lineament which coincides with a Cretaceous aged sinistral <b>shear</b> <b>zone.</b> This <b>shear</b> <b>zone,</b> called the Grenville Channel <b>shear</b> <b>zone</b> (GCSZ), separates panels of rocks intruded by the 109 Ma Capitan Cove pluton to the west from rocks intruded by the 90 Ma Ecstall pluton on the east. The GCSZ is subvertical and northwest striking and contains rocks with mylonitic fabrics. Lineations have moderate to shallow plunges in the <b>shear</b> <b>zone.</b> Folds adjacent to the GCSZ rotate in a counterclockwise sense into parallelism with the <b>shear</b> <b>zone</b> indicating a <b>shear</b> <b>zone</b> directed increasing strain gradient. ^ Geothermobarmetric studies conducted on metamorphosed country and igneous samples indicate pressures variations for {{the eastern side of}} the shear from 8 kbars in the north to a low of 5. 2 kbars in the middle before a return to near 8 kbars at the southern terminus of the channel. Rocks to the west of the <b>shear</b> <b>zone</b> record homogenous pressures between 6. 4 and 7. 3 kbars. We interpret the structural data as evidence for strain partitioning during transpression between areas adjacent to the <b>shear</b> <b>zone</b> which were dominated by horizontal shorting and the <b>shear</b> <b>zone</b> itself which was dominated by sinistral transcurrent displacement. This pattern of strain partitioning produced differential uplift and exhumation along the <b>shear</b> <b>zone</b> causing the observed pressure differences. ...|$|R
