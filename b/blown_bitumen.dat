Blown bitumens like Mexphalte, {{with a high}} content of saturated hydrocarbons, are more easily biodegraded by microorganisms than direct distillation bitumen, with a low content of saturated hydrocarbons and a high content of aromatic hydrocarbons.|$|E

In {{order to produce}} low sulphur diesel, a Diesel Hydro Desulphurisation Unit (DHDS) was commissioned in 1999.|$|R
50|$|The third 1 mmtpa {{distillation}} unit was commissioned in September 1967 to process Ankleshwar and North Gujarat crudes. In December 1968, Udex plant was commissioned for production of benzene and toluene using feedstock from CRU. By 1974-75 with in-house modifications, {{the capacity of}} the refinery increased by 40% to a level of 4.2 mmtpa. To process imported crude the refinery was expanded during 1978-79 by adding another 3 mmtpa crude {{distillation unit}} along with downstream processing units including vacuum distillation, visbreaker and <b>bitumen</b> <b>blowing</b> units. By 1980-81 this unit started processing Bombay High crude in addition to imported crudes. It {{was the first time that}} Indian engineers independently handled a project of that scale.|$|R
40|$|Many {{units of}} <b>blown</b> <b>bitumen</b> and used-motor oil {{reprocessing}} industries have been currently implemented and many modern technologies and additives {{are being developed}} and requested continuously. The objective of current study was a management and economic survey in implementation of <b>blown</b> <b>bitumen</b> production using acidic sludge recycling as a new additive that encompasses financial views and other success factors so carried out using a Kanji’s Business Excellence Model, empirical equations, professional experiences and observations during establishment an industry. Using acidic sludge had promoted the product quality in parallel with the TQM parameters. Current study had shown the indices values such as value-added percent, profit, annual income, breakeven point, value-added, output value, data value, variable cost of commodity unit and production costs {{were found to be}} about 44 %, $ 5308605. 14, $ 5252251. 65, $ 1183. 67, $ 5401935. 47, $ 6748064. 5, $ 12150000, $ 140. 93 and $ 6897748. 4 respectively. The breakeven point about 2. 46 %, time of return on investment about 0. 07, BES about 800. 2 (for KBEM) and 806. 77 (for EFQM) was represented a systematic practice so that thrift outlays and boost the strength and weakness points to improve...|$|E
40|$|The {{studies the}} results of which are {{presented}} in the article have been performed to evaluate <b>blown</b> <b>bitumen</b> resistance in the temperature range characteristic of Kazakhstan’s sharp-continental climate. The tests were performed at different temperatures using the Superpave methods and devices. The comparison {{of the values of}} shear complex modulus, stiffness and relaxation rate index with the specified values has indicated that the bitumens applied meet the climatic conditions requirements only for the part of the territory and the use of polymers is required to improve the thermal resistance. The thermal resistance shall be determined at the asphalt concrete mix design...|$|E
