5|$|The United States Capitol is {{considered}} one of the most haunted buildings in Washington. The first apparition to be seen there was in the 1860s as the Capitol was being completed. Several spirits are said to haunt the Capitol due to tragedies associated with its construction. One such ghost is said to be that of a worker who died after a fall during the construction of the rotunda, and who now is occasionally seen floating <b>beneath</b> the dome carrying a tray of woodworking tools. Another spirit is allegedly a stonemason who died (crushed to death <b>beneath</b> a wall which collapsed, or murdered by a co-worker) and is seen in the Old Senate chambers or passing through a wall in the basement <b>beneath</b> the Senate.|$|E

5|$|At bedtime on Christmas Eve, {{the family}} makes last-minute {{preparations}} at home, Marge tells everyone {{that no one}} can open presents until 7 AM and confiscates all of the alarm clocks. However, Bart drinks 12 glasses of water to wake up early and secretly unwraps his gifts, one of which is a remote-controlled fire truck. Bart plays with it until it sprays water on an overloaded electrical socket, causing a fire that engulfs and melts the plastic Christmas tree and all of the presents <b>beneath</b> it. Bart hides the evidence outside <b>beneath</b> the snow in the front yard.|$|E

5|$|Built of limestone, {{in classic}} Palladian style, the {{southern}} façade {{takes the form}} of a temple-like central bay with symmetrical wings connecting to two flanking, terminating pavilions. The central bay is given eminence by a broken pediment supported by austere Doric pillasters. It in turn is flanked by two small bays, each with a small pointed pediment supported by shallow pilasters, which further emphasise and complement the central broken pediment sitting above a large Palladian window– the focal point of the building. On this southern side the structure comprises a principal floor at street level, with a low mezzanine separated by stone banding above. <b>Beneath</b> the principal floor is a sub-floor constructed in the masonry between the spans of the bridge, its presence indicated by ocular windows placed symmetrically <b>beneath</b> the span of each arch. This ocular motif, on a reduced scale, is repeated symmetrically at mezzanine level <b>beneath</b> the central broken pediment. The two terminating pavilions, in reality slight projections, have shallow saucer domes concealed behind their pointed pediments. The roof is pitched and of Welsh slate.|$|E
