Bioluminescence is a technique which is rapid and potentially sensitive enough to detect significant numbers of bacteria in urine specimens. To determine whether bioluminescence is practical and cost effective for routine use, we compared two commercially available instruments and kits, Lumac and Monolight, to standard bacterial cultures on 986 urine specimens. Lumac had an overall 83. 7 % agreement with cultures, a sensitivity of 92. 4 %, and a specificity of 79. 4 %. Monolight had 83. 5 % agreement with cultures, a sensitivity of 89. 1 %, and a specificity of 81. 8 %. There were 13. 8 % false-positive results and 2. 5 % false-negative results with both systems. When only potentially significant organisms were included, the false-negative rate was reduced to ca. 1 %. Both systems are sufficiently accurate to be recommended for routine use.

40|$|Abstract Background Mycobacteria have {{developed}} a number of pathways that provide partial protection against both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). We recently identified a locus in Mycobacterium marinum, mel 2, that plays a role during infection of macrophages. The molecular mechanism of mel 2 action is not well understood. Results To better understand {{the role of the}} M. marinum mel 2 locus, we examined these genes for conserved motifs in silico. Striking similarities were observed between the mel 2 locus and loci that encode <b>bioluminescence</b> in other <b>bacterial</b> species. Since <b>bioluminescence</b> systems can play a role in resistance to oxidative stress, we postulated that the mel 2 locus might be important for mycobacterial resistance to ROS and RNS. We found that an M. marinum mutant in the first gene in this putative operon, melF, confers increased susceptibility to both ROS and RNS. This mutant is more susceptible to ROS and RNS together than either reactive species alone. Conclusion These observations support a role for the M. marinum mel 2 locus in resistance to oxidative stress and provide additional evidence that bioluminescence systems may have evolved from oxidative defense mechanisms. </p...|$|R

Conventional techniques to enumerate Y. pestis can be labor intensive and do not lend themselves to high throughput assays. In contrast, bioluminescent bioreporters produce light that can be detected using plate readers or optical imaging platforms to monitor bacterial populations {{as a function of}} luminescence. Here, we describe the development of two Y. pestis chromosomal-based luxCDABE bioreporters, Lux(PtolC) and Lux(PcysZK). These bioreporters use constitutive promoters to drive expression of luxCDABE that allow for sensitive detection of bacteria via bioluminescence in vitro. Importantly, both bioreporters demonstrate a direct correlation between <b>bacterial</b> numbers and <b>bioluminescence,</b> which allows for bioluminescence to be used to compare bacterial numbers. We demonstrate the use of these bioreporters to test antimicrobial inhibitors (Lux(PtolC)) and monitor intracellular survival (Lux(PtolC) and Lux(PcysZK)) in vitro. Furthermore, we show that Y. pestis infection of the mouse model can be monitored using whole animal optical imaging in real time. Using optical imaging, we observed Y. pestis dissemination and differentiated between virulence phenotypes in live animals via bioluminescence. Finally, we demonstrate that whole animal optical imaging can identify unexpected colonization patterns in mutant-infected animals...|$|R

40|$|A novel whole cell {{bacterial}} biosensor, which emits {{light in}} response to the active metabolite of cytosine arabinoside (ara-C, cytarabine), ara-CTP, has been investigated and verified. The biosensor has been formulated as an ex vivo assay, designed for peripheral blood or bone marrow cells, which can produce a clinical result within a working day. The nucleoside analogue ara-C is a key agent for treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML); treatment decisions are made rapidly with AML, patients often receiving same-day commencement of chemotherapy. Currently no rapid predictive test is available to select appropriate therapy for patients prior to treatment. Experiments were designed to determine optimal assay conditions using leukaemic cell lines. We observed a significant increase (~ 15 fold) in bioluminescence signal compared to control after 8 -h incubation of the biosensor with ara-C. This corresponded to a > 2 -log increase in light output per <b>bacterial</b> cell. Interestingly, <b>bioluminescence</b> conferred a survival advantage to the bacteria following ara-C treatment. The assay is sensitive (lower limit of quantitation of 0. 05 µM), selective, accurate (≤ 15 % RE) and precise (≤ 15 % coefficient of variation) over a linear concentration range of ara-CTP (0. 05 – 0. 5 µM), and detection is independent of reaction volume. Recovery of added standard was tested using ex vivo patient leukaemic cells (n= 5). Stability studies on lyophilized bacterial biosensor were performed to ensure maintenance of performance over 12 months.

Landfill leachates and airborne PM 10 were collected and assessed for their transition metal-mediated in vitro bioreactivity by a plasmid DNA scission assay (PSA). Human tissue equivalents (EpiDerm - 200 and EpiAirway - 100 MatTek Corp., USA) were exposed to landfill leachate or PM 10 and evaluated for cell viability (MTT assay) and trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER). The novel use of the oxidant-sensitive probe, DCFH, with landfill leachates was a good indication of leachate ROS activity. The results also revealed that leachate bioreactivity varied inter- and intra-landfills {{it was not possible}} to establish an easily elucidated trend associated with most commonly measured physical parameters (data kindly provided by landfill operators). Metal chelation by EDTA, DTPA, DES and Chelex resin caused significant attenuation of landfill leachate oxidant activity in both the PSA and DCFH assays. Acute leachate toxicity, gauged by a <b>bacterial</b> V. fischeri <b>bioluminescence</b> assay (ROTAS), revealed temporal-dependant hormetic responses from the bacteria which corresponded to high levels of TDS, conductivity and redox potential. Undiluted leachates were not acutely cytotoxic to EpiDerm - 200 following 24 h exposure. PM 10 was collected from a Cardiff landfill and characterised by FESEM-EDX, ICP-MS and IC. The landfill PM 10 physicochemistry varied year-on-year, and was dependent upon anthropogenic site activity. Metal chelation by EDTA, DTPA, DES and surrogate epithelial lining fluid caused significant attenuation of landfill PM 10 oxidant activity in the PSA this was comparable to Cardiff urban PM 10 reactivity. The PM 2 5 - 01 soluble fraction was the most oxidant component. Landfill PM 10 (500 ug/ml) was not cytotoxic to EpiAirway - 100 following 24 h exposure.

40|$|Streptococcus suis is an {{important}} pig pathogen {{but it is also}} zoonotic, i. e. capable of causing diseases in humans. Human S. suis infections are quite uncommon but potentially life-threatening and the pathogen is an emerging public health concern. This Gram-positive bacterium possesses a galabiose-specific (Galalpha 1 − 4 Gal) adhesion activity, which has been studied for over 20 years. P-fimbriated Escherichia coli−bacteria also possess a similar adhesin activity targeting the same disaccharide. The galabiose-specific adhesin of S. suis was identified by an affinity proteomics method. No function of the protein identified was formerly known and it was designated streptococcal adhesin P (SadP). The peptide sequence of SadP contains an LPXTG-motif and the protein was proven to be cell wall−anchored. SadP may be multimeric since in SDS-PAGE gel it formed a protein ladder starting from about 200 kDa. The identification was confirmed by producing knockout strains lacking functional adhesin, which had lost their ability to bind to galabiose. The adhesin gene was cloned in a bacterial expression host and properties of the recombinant adhesin were studied. The galabiose-binding properties of the recombinant protein were found to be consistent with previous results obtained studying whole bacterial cells. A live-bacteria application of surface plasmon resonance was set up, and various carbohydrate inhibitors of the galabiose-specific adhesins were studied with this assay. The potencies of the inhibitors were highly dependent on multivalency. Compared with P-fimbriated E. coli, lower concentrations of galabiose derivatives were needed to inhibit the adhesion of S. suis. Multivalent inhibitors of S. suis adhesion were found to be effective at low nanomolar concentrations. To specifically detect galabiose adhesin−expressing S. suis bacteria, a technique utilising magnetic glycoparticles and an ATP <b>bioluminescence</b> <b>bacterial</b> detection system was also developed. The identification and characterisation of the SadP adhesin give valuable information on the adhesion mechanisms of S. suis, and {{the results of this study}} may be helpful for the development of novel inhibitors and specific detection methods of this pathogen...|$|R
50|$|The {{regulation}} of bio-luminescence in bacteria is achieved through the {{regulation of}} the oxidative enzyme called luciferase.

30|$|Toxicity {{evaluation}} of contaminated environments has gained widespread attention {{over the past}} two decades (Banks and Schultz 2005). Toxicity bioassays provide information on the detection of contaminated chemicals as well as the bioavailability of substances that may harm the environment (Alvarenga et al. 2008). However, no individual bioassay can provide a true estimation of chemical toxicity since none has uniform sensitivity to all pollutants. Therefore, evaluation based on individual toxicity levels is of limited benefit unless it can be correlated with other data. Plaza et al. (2010) reported that it is essential to select appropriate organisms to test for different taxonomic groups and candidates representing different links of the trophic chain because organisms show variable sensitivity to different substances. To test chemical toxicity, various organisms such as bacteria, algae, protozoa, plants, and fish are utilized (US EPA 1993). In addition to whole organisms, several key metabolic processes of organisms, specifically enzyme activity or biosynthesis, and <b>bacterial</b> <b>bioluminescence,</b> have been used to assess toxicity of environmental systems. Plant processes have been performed for several different types of toxicity studies involving in environmental biomonitoring (Di Salvatore et al. 2008). For example, seed germination primarily assess acute toxic effects in the short-term, whereas long-term studies for both acute and chronic toxicities designed to evaluate plant biomass and root/shoot elongation over a 2 – 8  week period (Wang and Liu 2001). These plant bioassays are particularly proper for soil contamination (Boutin et al. 2004). <b>Bacterial</b> <b>bioluminescence</b> assay is also a time-saving, cost-effective test that is widely used for determining the acute toxicities of various type of samples (Wang et al. 2002).|$|E

Photobacterium phosphoreum ANT- 2200 has been isolated from the NW Mediterranean Sea at 2200 -m depth (in situ temperature of 13 °C) close to the ANTARES neutrino telescope. The effects of hydrostatic pressure on its growth and luminescence have been investigated under controlled laboratory conditions, using a specifically developed high-pressure bioluminescence system. The growth rate and the maximum population density of the strain were determined at different temperatures (from 4 to 37 °C) and pressures (from 0. 1 to 40 MPa), using the logistic model to define these two growth parameters. Indeed, using the growth rate only, no optimal temperature and pressure could be determined. However, when both growth rate and maximum population density were jointly taken into account, a cross coefficient was calculated. By this way, the optimum growth conditions for P. phosphoreum ANT- 2200 {{were found to be}} 30 °C and, 10 MPa defining this strain as mesophile and moderately piezophile. Moreover, the ratio of unsaturated vs. saturated cellular fatty acids was found higher at 22 MPa, in agreement with previously described piezophile strains. P. phosphoreum ANT- 2200 also appeared to respond to high pressure by forming cell aggregates. Its maximum population density was 1. 2 times higher, with a similar growth rate, than at 0. 1 MPa. Strain ANT- 2200 grown at 22 MPa produced 3 times more bioluminescence.

Both total and weak acid-extracted metal contents showed no observable correlations with the activity of any bioassays (r 2  <  0.279).
