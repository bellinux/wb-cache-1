[...] PAHs are widely {{spread throughout the}} environment through the incomplete burning of coal, wood, or petroleum products. Although PAHs do not bioaccumulate in vertebrate tissue, many studies have confirmed that certain PAH compounds such as benzo(a)pyrene, <b>benz(a)anthracene,</b> and Benzofluoranthene, are bioavailable and responsible for liver diseases like cancer in wild fish populations. One mechanism of action for genotoxic carcinogens includes the formation of DNA adducts. Once the PAH compound enters an organism, it becomes metabolized and available for biotransformation.|$|E

50|$|PAHs - The EPA has {{classified}} seven PAH compounds as probable human carcinogens: <b>benzaanthracene,</b> benzoapyrene, benzobfluoranthene, benzokfluoranthene, chrysene, dibenz(a,h)anthracene, and indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene.|$|E
50|$|Being a fully benzenoid PAH {{means that}} {{triphenylene}} {{is much more}} resonance stable than its isomers chrysene, <b>benzaanthracene,</b> benzocphenanthrene, and tetracene. This makes {{it much more difficult}} to hydrogenate to the saturated hydrocarbon.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2014, NASA {{announced}} a greatly upgraded database for tracking {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs), including <b>benzaanthracene,</b> in the universe. [...] According to scientists, more than 20% of the carbon in the universe {{may be associated with}} PAHs, possible starting materials for the formation of life. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the Big Bang, are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets.|$|E

50|$|The oldest {{characterized}} thermal rearrangement of an {{aromatic compound}} {{was that of}} the isomerization of azulene to naphthalene by Heilbronner et al. in 1947. Since then, many other isomerizations have been recorded, however the rearrangement of azulene to naphthalene has received the most attention. Likewise, since the characterization of the automerization of naphthalene by Scott in 1977, similar atom scramblings of other aromatic hydrocarbons such as pyrene, azulene, <b>benzaanthracene</b> and even benzene have been described. While the existence of these reactions has been confirmed, the isomerization and automerization mechanisms remain unknown.|$|E
5000|$|In 1922, Ernest Kennaway {{determined}} that the carcinogenic component of coal tar mixtures was an organic compound consisting of only C and H. This component was later linked to a characteristic fluorescent pattern that was similar but not identical to [...] <b>benzaanthracene,</b> a PAH that was subsequently demonstrated to cause tumors. Cook, Hewett and Hieger then linked the specific spectroscopic fluorescent profile of [...] benzoapyrene {{to that of the}} carcinogenic component of coal tar, {{the first time that a}} specific compound from an environmental mixture (coal tar) was demonstrated to be carcinogenic.|$|E
50|$|The organic {{contaminant}} guidelines {{also appeared to}} be very accurate for all classes of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) {{and most of the}} individual PAHs. The incidence of effects was 25% or below when the concentrations were below the respective ERL value, with only (fluorene as an exception, while the incidence of effects was 75% or greater at concentrations above the respective ERM, excepting dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, p,p’-DDE, total dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and total Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Importantly, one hundred percent effects were seen in concentrations above the ERM for acenaphthylene, 2-methyl napthalene, and low-molecular weight PAHs, and ninety percent or greater effects in this range were seen for chromium, lead, silver, <b>benz(a)anthracene,</b> and fluoranthene.|$|E

5000|$|Methylcholanthrene is {{a highly}} {{carcinogenic}} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon produced by burning organic compounds at very high temperatures. Methylcholanthrene {{is also known as}} 3-methylcholanthrene, 20-methylcholanthrene or the IUPAC name 3-methyl-1,2-dyhydrobenzojaceanthrylene. The short notation often used is 3-MC or MCA. This compound forms pale yellow solid crystals when crystallized from benzene and ether. It has a melting point around 180 °C and its boiling point is around 280 °C at a pressure of 80 mmHg. [...] Methylcholanthrene is used in laboratory studies of chemical carcinogenesis. It is an alkylated derivative of <b>benzaanthracene</b> and has a similar UV spectrum. The most common isomer is 3-methylcholanthrene, although the methyl group can occur in other places.|$|E
