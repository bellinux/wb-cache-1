5|$|Rather than {{requiring}} all desired functionality to <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the language's core, Python {{was designed}} to be highly extensible. Python can also be embedded in existing applications that need a programmable interface. This design of a small core language with a large standard library and an easily extensible interpreter was intended by Van Rossum from the start because of his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite mindset.|$|E
5|$|The station {{opened to}} coal traffic on 27 July 1898 and to {{passengers}} on 15 March 1899. It was the terminus of the GCR's London extension main lineâ€“ {{the last major}} railway line to <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> London until High Speed 1. The Great Central Railway linked London to stations in , , Rugby, Leicester, Nottingham, Sheffield and Manchester. Local services from northwest Middlesex, High Wycombe and Aylesbury also terminated at Marylebone. The GCR moved its headquarters to Marylebone from Manchester in 1905.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{earliest}} buildings were simple gabled rectangles, a style that continued to <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the seventeenth century. Examples include Dunnottar Castle in the 1580s, Greenock (1591) and Durness (1619), These new buildings often had windows on the south wall and none on the north, which became a unique feature of Reformation kirks. There were continuities with pre-Reformation materials, with some churches using rubble, as at Kemback in Fife (1582). Others employed stone and a few added wooden steeples, as at Burntisland (1592). The church of Greyfriars, Edinburgh, built between 1602 and 1620, used a rectangular layout with a largely Gothic form, but that at Dirleton (1612), had a more sophisticated classical style.|$|E

5|$|Scotland {{is known}} for its {{dramatically}} placed castles, many of which date from the late medieval era. In contrast to England, where the wealthy began to move towards more comfortable grand houses, these continued to <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the modern period, developing into the style of Scottish Baronial architecture in the 19th century, popular amongst the minor aristocracy and merchant class. This building type, often built with defence in mind {{in the form of the}} tower house, was characterised by corbelled turrets and crow-stepped gables marked the first uniquely Scottish mode of building. Ceilings of these houses were decorated with vividly coloured painting on boards and beams, using emblematic motifs from European pattern books or the artist's interpretation of trailing grotesque patterns. The grandest buildings of this type were the royal palaces in this style at Linlithgow, Holyrood, Falkland and the remodelled Stirling Castle, all of which have elements of continental European architecture, particularly from France and the Low Countries, adapted to Scottish idioms and materials (particularly stone and harl). More modest buildings with continental influences can be seen in the late 15th century western tower of St Mary's parish church, Dundee, and tollbooths like the one at Dunbar.|$|E

Capacitors used in these applications may <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> a printed circuit board, between the various layers. These are {{often referred to as}} embedded capacitors. The layers in the board contributing to the capacitive properties also function as power and ground planes, and have a dielectric in between them, enabling them to operate as a parallel plate capacitor.|$|E

As an option, an exported AnyLogic model can <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> other pieces of software and work as an additional module to ERP, MRP, and TMS systems. Another typical use is integration of an AnyLogic model with TXT, MS Excel, or MS Access files and databases (MS SQL, My SQL, Oracle, etc.). Also, Anylogic models include their own databases based on HSQLDB.|$|E
25|$|Tidal stream {{generators}} (or TSGs) {{make use}} of the kinetic energy of moving water to power turbines, in a similar way to wind turbines that use wind to power turbines. Some tidal generators can <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the structures of existing bridges or are entirely submersed, thus avoiding concerns over impact on the natural landscape. Land constrictions such as straits or inlets can create high velocities at specific sites, which can be captured with the use of turbines. These turbines can be horizontal, vertical, open, or ducted.|$|E
25|$|Driving Unger's {{political}} engagement is {{the idea}} that society can be made and remade. Unlike Mill or Marx, who posited a particular class as the agent of history, Unger does not see a single vehicle for transformative politics. He advocates world-wide revolution, but does not see this happening as a single cataclysmic event or undertaken by a class agent, like the Communist movement. Rather, he sees the possibility of piecemeal change, where institutions can be replaced one at a time, and permanent plasticity can <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the institutional infrastructure.|$|E

25|$|The raised ranch is {{a two-story}} house, {{in which a}} {{finished}} basement serves as an additional floor. It may <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> a hill to some degree, such that the full size {{of the house is}} not evident from the curb. However, it does not become a raised ranch simply by having two floors. For it to be a raised ranch, you will have to climb a flight of steps to get to the main living floor - if not it is just a bi-level house. Among real estate agents, this term is commonly misused.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{there was}} {{discussion}} in the MCC about possibly removing the Grace Gates {{to another part of}} Lord's. This was discussed after consideration of the MCC's planned redevelopment of Lord's with the Grosvenor Group and because the gates were being constantly damaged by supply lorries turning {{in the vicinity of the}} gates. However the MCC members voted against moving the gates. In 2013, as part of a revised redevelopment of Lord's, it was announced that a new entrance would <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> Lord's to supersede the Grace Gates as the entrance for MCC members. The gates themselves would be locked for three years while the pavilion end is redeveloped.|$|E
25|$|A {{telegraph}} line from Mexico City to Cuernavaca {{had been laid}} between 1867 and 1869; in 1870 it was extended to Iguala, Chilpancingo, and Tixla. Another line, between Cuernavaca and Cuautla, was laid in 1875. Attempts were made to improve education, but limited funds made that virtually impossible. Other infrastructure projects in the late 19th century included the Toluca-Cuernavaca highway, and a rail line between Mexico City and Cuautla. Rail lines would continue to <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the 20th century, connecting the state further with Mexico City and the Pacific Ocean. On May 11, 1874 the capital was moved to Cuautla; it was returned to Cuernavaca on January 1, 1876.|$|E

25|$|Skiers in this {{classification}} {{compete with}} one or two skis and two ski poles, except in para-Nordic skiing where the skier must use two skis and two ski poles. Skiers use skis that would be slightly longer than if they were able bodied. Skiing with a prosthesis is allowed in this classification in international competitions. In training, skiers can also use cants, wedges and prostheses with a special skiing prosthesis having been developed for use. The prosthetic may <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the ski boot for below knee amputees, though FIS rules for ski boots and binding heights are enforced for everyone in this class.|$|E

IBM Secure Blue is encryption hardware that can <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> microprocessors, and in 2014, the company revealed it was investing $3 {{billion over the}} following five years to design a neural chip that mimics the human brain, with 10 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses, but that uses just 1 kilowatt of power. In 2016, the company launched all-flash arrays designed for small and midsized companies, which includes software for data compression, provisioning, and snapshots across various systems.|$|E

Three terminus platforms and a through track will be closed and three new through platforms created, to allow all services going to Cannon Street and Charing Cross to stop at London Bridge, as well as additional services to Thameslink stations north of the Thames. A new station concourse is being built to improve circulation, and the adjacent bus station expanded. New retail facilities will <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the existing western arcade, which will be re-opened and extended to link the Underground station and Joiner Street.|$|E
