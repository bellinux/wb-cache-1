5|$|The most {{widespread}} {{species is}} the brown bear, which occurs from Western Europe eastwards through Asia {{to the western}} areas of North America. The American black <b>bear</b> <b>is</b> restricted to North America, and the polar <b>bear</b> <b>is</b> restricted to the Arctic Sea. All the remaining species of bear are Asian. They occur {{in a range of}} habitats which include tropical lowland rainforest, both coniferous and broadleaf forests, prairies, steppes, montane grassland, alpine scree slopes, Arctic tundra {{and in the case of}} the polar bear, ice floes. Bears may dig their dens in hillsides or use caves, hollow logs and dense vegetation for shelter.|$|E

5|$|The drop <b>bear</b> <b>is</b> an {{imaginary}} creature in contemporary Australian folklore featuring a predatory, carnivorous {{version of the}} koala. This hoax animal is commonly spoken about in tall tales designed to scare tourists. While koalas are typically docile herbivores, drop bears are described as unusually large and vicious marsupials that inhabit treetops and attack unsuspecting people (or other prey) that walk beneath them by dropping onto their heads from above.|$|E
25|$|Black <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> easily tamed, {{and can be}} {{fed with}} rice, maize, sweet potato, cassava, pumpkin, ripe fruit, animal fat and sweet foods. Keeping captive black <b>bears</b> <b>is</b> popular in China, {{especially}} due {{to the belief that}} milking the bear's gall bladder leads to quick prosperity. <b>Bears</b> <b>are</b> also popular as pets in Vietnam.|$|R
50|$|In Traditional Chinese medicine, the bile {{from several}} species of <b>bears</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} to have a medicinal effect. Traditionally bile <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> hunted for their gallbladder, but with the adoption of factory farming methods bile <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> kept alive in captivity while their bile is painfully extracted, in an industry characterized by animal cruelty.|$|R

5|$|Wes grabs {{a can of}} {{gasoline}} and pours a trail from the Jeep to the woods. They lure the Grizzly Bear to it and then set the gasoline on fire. The Jeep explodes, but the <b>bear</b> <b>is</b> unharmed. They decide to try another plan and split up. Wes climbs a tree, leaving his blood covered clothes {{on the ground to}} fool the Bear. While the <b>Bear</b> <b>is</b> sniffing at the clothes, Wes accidentally drops a tire iron, calling the bear's attention up. The bear shakes him out of the tree but he escapes and goes to the shack where Lauren has built a trap. They lure the bear into the shack, and use a trigger to close the front door behind it, locking it in. They celebrate and start to leave but the bear breaks out of the shack and they both try to escape. Unfortunately, Wes stumbles and Lauren tries to get him back up, refusing to leave him behind despite his desperate insistence that she should run. The Bear catches up to them and presumably kills them both.|$|E
5|$|Greg <b>Bear</b> <b>is</b> {{an award-winning}} science fiction writer from Seattle. He {{has won three}} Nebula Awards, {{including}} the 1995 Award for Best Novel for Moving Mars, and two Hugo Awards, including the 1983 Award for Best Novelette for Blood Music. City at the End of Time was his first novel since Quantico, which {{was first published in}} 2005. Bear's early influences included science fiction authors Robert A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov and Poul Anderson.|$|E
5|$|On an {{ordinary}} day, a brown bear strolls {{onto the streets}} of Springfield, frightening the town. The <b>bear</b> <b>is</b> eventually subdued by the police. Homer convinces Springfield that {{something needs to be}} done to protect them from bears, and the town takes their complaint to Mayor Quimby, who gives in easily. Soon, the Bear Patrol is created. Homer is then shocked to see taxes have been raised five dollars to maintain the patrol, and this warrants another visit by the town to the Mayor's office. To appease them, Mayor Quimby blames the high taxes on illegal immigrants. He creates Proposition 24, which will require all illegal immigrants in Springfield to be deported.|$|E

5|$|The American {{black bear}} (Ursus americanus), {{among the largest}} animals along the Appalachian Trail, rarely confronts people. The black <b>bear</b> <b>is</b> the largest {{omnivore}} that may be encountered on the trail, and it inhabits all regions of the Appalachians. Bear sightings on the trail are uncommon, except in certain sections, especially Shenandoah National Park and portions of New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts sections, where bear populations have increased steadily since 1980; confrontations are rarer still.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} logo of {{this edition}} of the Mediterranean Games featured simple graphical illustrations of mountains and sea of the Abruzzo region. Pescara is the capital of Province of Pescara which is situated in the Abruzzo region. The official mascot was a Marsican brown bear, called Aua`, wearing a diving mask and flip-flops with swimfins in his hands. The Marsican brown <b>bear</b> <b>is</b> a highly threatened, unrecognised subspecies of the Brown bear, with a range restricted to the Abruzzo National Park. The mascot was unveiled by the Mediterranean Games Executive Committee during their meeting in Pescara from 24 to 28 March 2008.|$|E
5|$|The red panda's local names {{differ from}} place to place. The Lepcha people call it sak nam. In Nepal, the species is called bhalu biralo (bear-cat) and habre. The Sherpa people of Nepal and Sikkim call it ye niglva ponva and wah donka. The word wậː is Sunuwari meaning bear; in Tamang language, a small, red <b>bear</b> <b>is</b> called tāwām. In the Kanchenjunga region of eastern Nepal, the Limbus know red pandas as kaala, which {{literally}} means dark because of their underside pelage; villagers of Tibetan origin call them hoptongar.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, Asian Black Bears entered Hata Town, {{in search}} of food. Crops of local farmers {{suffered}} a lot of damage. Between 10 and 15 <b>bears</b> <b>were</b> caught using mustard spray, and then the <b>bears</b> <b>were</b> returned to the mountains. The <b>bears</b> <b>were</b> tracked with radar tracking technology, and follow-up surveys <b>were</b> conducted. <b>Bears</b> continue to enter Hata, due to dwindling food supplies in their habitats.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bears</b> <b>are</b> {{illegally}} {{sourced by}} poaching. Asiatic black bears and brown <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> {{known to be}} poached in Pakistan and used in bear baiting. Asiatic black <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> listed as vulnerable on the World Conservation Union's (IUCN's) Red List of Threatened Animals. The capture of <b>bear</b> cubs <b>is</b> prohibited across three provinces of Pakistan by: the North West Frontier Province Conservation and Management Act (1975); the Punjab Wildlife Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management Act (1974); and the Sindh Wildlife Protection Ordinance (1972).|$|R

5|$|The {{subfamily}} Ursinae {{experienced a}} dramatic proliferation of taxa about 5.3–4.5 Mya, coincident with major environmental changes; the first {{members of the}} genus Ursus appeared around this time. The sloth <b>bear</b> <b>is</b> a modern survivor {{of one of the}} earliest lineages to diverge during this radiation event (5.3 Mya); it took on its peculiar morphology, related to its diet of termites and ants, no later than by the early Pleistocene. By 3–4 Mya, the species Ursus minimus appears in the fossil record of Europe; apart from its size, it was nearly identical to today's Asian black bear. It is likely ancestral to all bears within Ursinae, perhaps aside from the sloth bear. Two lineages evolved from U. minimus: the black bears (including the sun bear, the Asian black bear, and the American black bear); and the brown bears (which includes the polar bear). Modern brown bears evolved from U. minimus via Ursus etruscus, which itself is ancestral to the extinct Pleistocene cave bear. Species of Ursinae have migrated repeatedly into North America from Eurasia as early as 4 Mya during the early Pliocene. The polar <b>bear</b> <b>is</b> the most recently evolved species and descended from the brown bear around 400,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|The worm {{removed from}} <b>Bear</b> <b>is</b> {{kept in a}} jar, and another is {{recovered}} {{from one of the}} scientists' bodies. Mulder (believing that the worms are extraterrestrial) wants them kept alive, but Scully feels that they should be destroyed to prevent infection. The group check each other for black nodules and find none, although Mulder reminds Scully that the nodules disappeared from the dog over time. When Mulder finds Murphy in the freezer with his throat cut, the others (including Scully) believe that he has become infected and killed Murphy. Mulder is then locked in a storeroom.|$|E
5|$|These small {{whales are}} also {{targeted}} by terrestrial and pagophilic predators. The polar <b>bear</b> <b>is</b> well adapted for hunting Arctic whales and calves. Bears {{are known to}} use sit-and-wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Whales lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. This however means less room around the breathing hole as the ice slowly closes the gap. When out at sea, whales dive {{out of the reach}} of surface-hunting orcas. Polar bear attacks on belugas and narwhals are usually successful in winter, but rarely inflict any damage in summer.|$|E

50|$|The Louisiana bear {{hunting season}} has {{remained}} closed since 1988. From 1964 through 1967, 161 black <b>bears</b> <b>were</b> live-trapped in Cook County, Minnesota and {{released in the}} Mississippi and Atchafalaya River bottoms of Louisiana {{in an effort to}} restock black bear to the state. By 1968 there was evidence that the translocated <b>bears</b> <b>were</b> reproducing. However, most of the relocated <b>bears</b> <b>were</b> killed on roads, as nuisance animals, or during recapture.|$|R
5|$|An apex {{predator}} affects {{prey population}} dynamics and defense tactics (such as camouflage). The polar <b>bear</b> <b>is</b> the apex predator within its range. Several animal species, particularly Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus), routinely scavenge polar bear kills. The relationship between ringed seals and polar bears {{is so close}} that the abundance of ringed seals in some areas appears to regulate the density of polar bears, while polar bear predation in turn regulates density and reproductive success of ringed seals. The evolutionary pressure of polar bear predation on seals probably accounts for some significant differences between Arctic and Antarctic seals. Compared to the Antarctic, {{where there is no}} major surface predator, Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out on the ice, and rarely defecate on the ice. The fur of Arctic pups is white, presumably to provide camouflage from predators, whereas Antarctic pups all have dark fur.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds {{are also}} {{targeted}} by terrestrial and pagophilic predators. The polar <b>bear</b> <b>is</b> well adapted for hunting Arctic seals and walruses, particularly pups. Bears {{are known to}} use sit-and-wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Other terrestrial predators include cougars, brown hyenas and various species of canids, which mostly target the young. Pinnipeds lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. Some species are capable of inflicting damaging wounds on their attackers with their sharp canines—an adult walrus is capable of killing polar bears. When out at sea, northern elephant seals dive {{out of the reach}} of surface-hunting orcas and white sharks. In the Antarctic, which lacks terrestrial predators, pinniped species spend more time on the ice than their Arctic counterparts. Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out, and rarely defecate on the ice. Ringed seals build dens underneath fast ice for protection.|$|E
5|$|The Quest Begins is {{the first}} novel in the Seekers series. It was written by Erin Hunter, which is a {{pseudonym}} used by authors Cherith Baldry, Kate Cary, Tui Sutherland and editor Victoria Holmes. The novel follows the adventures of four bears, Toklo, Kallik, Lusa and Ujurak. Each <b>bear</b> <b>is</b> stranded by themselves in the wild and must learn to survive. The declining environment of the bears is the main theme conveyed throughout the novel. Like the Warriors series also written by Erin Hunter, Seekers began as a request from HarperCollins who requested another animal story. The company and Victoria Holmes agreed to write about bears after discarding dogs, horses and dolphins. The novel was released in the US on 27 May 2008 and has also been released in the UK, Canada and translated into Russian. Critical reception was positive with reviewers praising the realistic behaviour of the bears.|$|E
50|$|Big <b>Bear</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} {{released in}} 1992. It {{should be noted}} that despite Red Star's resemblance to Colonel Brekhov, both Red Star and Big <b>Bear</b> <b>were</b> entirely new characters developed for the action figure line.|$|R
50|$|While early teddy <b>bears</b> <b>were</b> {{covered in}} tawny mohair fur, modern teddy <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> {{manufactured}} {{in a wide}} variety of commercially available fabrics, most commonly synthetic fur, but also velour, denim, cotton, satin, and canvas.|$|R
50|$|The Kamchatka {{brown bear}} (Ursus arctos beringianus) {{is a large}} {{subspecies}} found in far eastern Siberia. It {{is similar to the}} Kodiak bear, though darker in colour. These <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> usually hunted in the Shantar Islands (Okhotsk) and Magadan. In the spring, <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> hunted in coastal areas where they gather for food. During the autumn, <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> hunted while feeding on salmon or wild berries in the surrounding tundra. The average size of the <b>bears</b> taken <b>is</b> around 7.5-8.0 ft in Magadan and Okhotsk and 8.0-8.5 ft. in Kamchatka.|$|R
5|$|The {{black bears}} of Yosemite were once famous for {{breaking}} into parked cars to steal food. They were also an encouraged tourist sight {{for many years}} at the park's garbage dumps, where bears congregated to eat park visitors' garbage and tourists gathered to photograph the bears. Increasing encounters between bears and humans and increasing damage to property led to an aggressive campaign to discourage bears from relying on human food or interacting with people and their property. The open-air dumps were closed; all trash receptacles were replaced with bear-proof receptacles; all campgrounds were equipped with bear-proof food lockers so that people would not leave food in their vehicles, which were easy targets for the powerful and resourceful bears. Because bears who show aggression towards people usually are eventually destroyed, park personnel have continued {{to come up with}} innovative ways to have bears associate humans and their property with unpleasant experiences, such as being hit with rubber bullets. Today, about 30 bears a year are captured and ear-tagged and their DNA is sampled so that, when bear damage occurs, rangers can ascertain which <b>bear</b> <b>is</b> causing the problem.|$|E
5|$|The tundra is a sub-Arctic zone with long, cold winters and short, warm summers. Precipitation is low. Soil a meter {{below ground}} and deeper is {{permanently}} frozen (permafrost), {{which does not}} allow water to drain easily through the soil, so it collects in shallow pools. Trees and shrubs are stunted since their roots cannot grow into the permafrost. Low shrubs, lichens, mosses, and small herbaceous plants are found instead. The most common mammals on the tundra are the barren-ground caribou, Arctic wolf, Arctic fox, Arctic hare, lemmings, and voles. Occasional sightings of muskoxen have been made near Cape Chidley, Labrador's most northerly point. The polar <b>bear</b> <b>is</b> the dominant carnivore of the tundra, but is an occasional visitor to coastal Newfoundland, especially in the spring. Many birds migrate to Labrador in spring to lay their eggs and raise their young before returning south for the winter, including the common eider, harlequin duck, Common redpoll and American pipit. The Labrador tundra is also permanent home to ptarmigan.|$|E
5|$|Max {{breaks through}} {{security}} at the train yard and boards the train. She locates Van Der Mescht, who initially refuses to help her. After Max threatens him with torture, Van Der Mescht explains that I Corporation was a rival of Manticore, and had a military contract for more aggressive genetic research. They created a 'Y' series of genetically engineered soldiers (as opposed to Manticore's 'X' series); when Max and Beka were born, Beka was taken by I Corporation so that the two different series could be compared. I Corporation guards ambush the room, killing Van Der Mescht before he can divulge more. I Corporation send a single soldier, a transgenic boss named Bear, to kill Max. <b>Bear</b> <b>is</b> defeated, and Max reaches the I Corporation headquarters with the train. Max fights {{her way to the}} upper level of the headquarters, defeating guards and the boss characters Beetle, Gekko and Bear again, before she confronts Beka. Beka reveals that she now controls the I Corporation, and has engineered a younger replacement to succeed her using the DNA that she and Max shares. She tries to recruit Max to join her and their 'younger sister' in creating a new generation of genetically engineered soldiers. Max refuses and Beka attacks her. After killing Beka, Max tries to rescue her younger sister. The cloaked figure, whose identity is never revealed, tries unsuccessfully to stop her. Logan arrives in a helicopter and rescues Max and her younger sister from the complex. Later, while sitting {{on the roof of the}} Space Needle, Max laments that knowing the truth about Beka is worse than not knowing at all, but is determined to create a positive life for herself and her younger sister. A post-credits scene shows Max and Original Cindy dancing in their apartment.|$|E
