50|$|In February 2013, IMPALA {{and global}} rights agency Merlin {{announced}} a landmark agreement with Warner Music Group.

This included Parlophone Music Group, which was subsequently acquired by Warner Music Group. The agreement between IMPALA, Merlin and WMG aims to bring more scale into the independent sector by offering independent labels an opportunity to buy, license or distribute a significant portion of Parlophone assets or their equivalent in WMG-owned assets.

40|$|Patients' in-session commitments, decisions, or {{statements}} of intention {{to carry out}} novel behavioural acts between sessions are valued events for many therapeutic approaches. The value or importance of such events is enunciated {{in the body of}} psychotherapy theory as well as demonstrated by the results of research. First, the value of <b>behavioural</b> <b>commitments</b> is evident in many theories of psychotherapy, whether this be explicit or implicit. Secondly, research has demonstrated that in-session <b>behavioural</b> <b>commitments</b> are significantly associated with the carrying out of the selected behavioural acts post-session. Despite the importance of <b>behavioural</b> <b>commitments</b> in many systems of psychotherapy, scholars of psychotherapy have pointed out that serious lacunae exist in the specification of therapeutic operations which may be used in catalyzing the occurrence of <b>behavioural</b> <b>commitments.</b> Consequently, it is proposed that the study of therapeutic methods which catalyze such events would constitute a useful avenue of research. An exhaustive review of psychotherapy process research reveals that few research projects have studied the links between psychotherapeutic operations and <b>behavioural</b> <b>commitments.</b> Moreover, the few existing studies suffer from considerable limitations of scope and essentially have failed to identify links between psychotherapeutic operations and <b>behavioural</b> <b>commitments.</b> In order to address this question with a research focus which is appropriate to the current state of knowledge on the matter, the rationale is provided for a qualitative methodology. The aim of the study is to identify psychotherapeutic operations which catalyze "naturally occurring" instances of <b>behavioural</b> <b>commitments</b> identified in psychotherapy session transcripts. Raw data for the study was obtained through an exhaustive search of published transcripts of sessions from a broad array (any and all varieties) of psychotherapies. Products of the study are relevant to the practitioner as practitioner-ready concrete descriptions of behavioural commitment-catalyzing therapeutic operations, and to the researcher as a collection of propositions for further theorizing and research.

40|$|It {{has long}} been thought that, of all EU {{competition}} processes, merger regulation was immune from arbitration. This has changed dramatically {{over the last few}} years. Starting in 2000, the European Commission accepted, albeit reluctantly, to consider <b>behavioural</b> <b>commitments</b> made by merging entities. In the past, the Commission had considered that such commitments were not adequate to ensure competitive market structures. Compliance with structural remedies can be monitored fairly easily by the Commission. Structural commitments entail mostly divestments needed to maintain an acceptable level of competition. <b>Behavioural</b> <b>commitments,</b> however, require more extensive monitoring, since they concern the future behaviour of the merged entity. Monitoring these commitments is time consuming and the Merger Task Force (MTF) does not have the necessary resources to do so.

This thesis argues that the classic definition of commitment (Mowday, Porter and Steers, 1982) has been superseded by a reshaped psychological contract that affects the employment relationship in post-industrial society. Following exploratory, qualitative research organisational commitment was conceptualised as a multi-dimensional construct involving the congruence of individual and organisational goals, effort directed at goal achievement and innovation in the work place. A <b>Behavioural</b> <b>Commitment</b> Scale was developed and construct validity was examined through a cross sectional, quantitative survey of 329 pharmaceutical chemists, 166 public sector accountants and 138 private sector accountants. Social exchange theory is used to contextualise a study of how <b>behavioural</b> <b>commitment</b> is related to professionalism, perceived organisational support and social exchange disposition. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the three-dimensional structure of the <b>Behavioural</b> <b>Commitment</b> Scale. Multiple moderated regression revealed that the influence of situational variables upon interaction effects was greater than the nature of the profession. Union membership, low tenure, and prior involuntary job change all influenced positive interactions between perceived support and exchange. Professionalism moderated the effect of social exchange on commitment. Feelings of inability to leave the organisation and job insecurity in the late career stage both interact negatively with professionalism to have detrimental affects upon <b>behavioural</b> <b>commitment.</b> The implications for human resource management include: recognition of the influence that competing commitments have upon employees and the potential for judicious use of support; and, maintaining commitment in climates of job insecurity and job immobility.

40|$|Probabilistic {{reasoning}} is often attributed a temporal meaning, in which conditioning {{is regarded as}} a normative rule to compute future beliefs out of current beliefs and observations. However, the well-established ‘updating interpretation’ of conditioning is not concerned with beliefs that evolve in time, and in particular with future beliefs. On the other hand, a temporal justification of conditioning was proposed already by De Moivre and Bayes, by requiring that current and future beliefs be consistent. We reconsider the latter approach while dealing with a generalised version of the problem, using a behavioural theory of imprecise probability in the form of coherent lower previsions as well as of coherent sets of desirable gambles, and letting the possibility space be finite or infinite. We obtain that using conditioning is normative, in the imprecise case, only if one establishes future <b>behavioural</b> <b>commitments</b> at the same time of current beliefs. In this case it is also normative that present beliefs be conglomerable, which is a result that touches on a long-term controversy at the foundations of probability. In the remaining case, where one commits to some future behaviour after establishing present beliefs, we characterise the several possibilities to define consistent future assessments; this shows in particular that temporal consistency does not preclude changes of mind. And yet, our analysis does not support that rationality requires consistency in general, even though pursuing consistency makes sense and is useful, at least as a way to guide and evaluate the assessment process. These considerations narrow down in the special case of precis...|$|E

Majority of the studies that are grounded in the SCM have been conducted with athletes. To date, few studies have examined sport commitment of coaches however, these did not assess two commitment dimensions per se (functional or “want to” and obligatory or “have to” commitment to sport), rather each has measured certain predictor variables and inferred commitment dimensions based on clustering of predictors [i. e. 13]. This study had one main purpose, to examine the SCM amongst coaches. Specifically, coaches’ commitment to sport and its predictors were assessed {{from the perspective of the}} coaches themselves. This was conducted in both a team and an individual sport participation environment. Coaches’ sport commitment was examined during the respective sports season in order to allow all coaches a chance to participate, using current experience to draw upon when they completed the survey. A sample of 92 coaches from Australia and New Zealand, who participate in various sports, completed an anonymous online survey which assessed commitment to sport dimensions and six of the predictor constructs. Results from a series of 3 separate linear regression analyses provided initial evidence about the factors that explain coaches’ functional, obligatory, and <b>behavioural</b> <b>commitment</b> to sport. It was found that Functional Commitment was significantly predicted by higher Sport Enjoyment, Involvement Opportunities, and Personal Investment. Obligatory Commitment, on the other hand, was predicted by higher Social Constraints and lower Involvement Alternatives. Finally, <b>Behavioural</b> <b>Commitment</b> was predicted by higher Personal Investments and Social Support. These findings have both theoretical and practical implications for future studies, given that this was the first study which explicitly measured different types of commitment to sport amongst coaches.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} explain the {{phenomenon}} of discretionary effort in Korean bank branches {{in terms of its}} antecedents and outcomes. Specifically, it has the following main objectives: First, it seeks to test whether or not discretionary effort in Korea can be explained in terms of the five motivation mechanisms identified by Benkhoff (1994) - need theories, positive work disposition, intrinsic motivation, <b>behavioural</b> <b>commitment</b> and social exchange theory by replicating her model, which originally functioned in the German context. The statistical results confirm that some of the motivation mechanisms function in the Korean context, such as the need for achievement, the need for esteem, and <b>behavioural</b> <b>commitment,</b> but others, such as work disposition, intrinsic motivation and social exchange theory, do not apply to the Korean context. This implies that the universality of motivation theories can be affected by national culture. Secondly, the thesis investigates the impact of group motivation mechanisms, in particular group norms and identification, on employees' discretionary effort and performance in Korean bank branches. This is because group motivation {{is not the same as}} individual motivation, since there is more to a group than the sum of the individuals who comprise it, although norms and identification as group motivation mechanisms can partly be explained by the individual motivation theories identified by Benkhoff (1994). For this reason, group motivation mechanisms are here treated as having an alternative and independent explanatory power for discretionary effort. Statistical results confirm that group motivation mechanisms are indeed independent of the five individual motivation theories. With regards to the relationship with discretionary effort, multiple-regression analysis demonstrates that employees' identification with their work organisation and some discretionary effort-promoting norms have a significant impact on discretionary effort of employees in Korea. Thirdly, the thesis examines the relationship between discretionary effort and financial performance in the service context. It is shown that there is a significant link in the Korean context. Finally, this thesis seeks to investigate the similarities and differences between motivation mechanisms to ensure whether or not they have their own explanatory power. It is concluded that employees' discretionary effort and performance in Korean bank branches are strongly affected not only by individual motivation mechanisms, but also by group motivation mechanisms such as norms and identification...|$|R

The explicit attitude measure appeared to be the best single predictor of whether the participant ended up taking an organ donor card.

In the case of low attitude strength, the likelihood of taking a donor card increased with an increasing positive implicit association. In contrast, increasing strength was associated with a weaker link between card taking and the implicit attitude measure.

To this end, heart rate (f H), respiration rate (f R), and deep body temperature (T b) were continuously monitored in outdoor enclosures by radio-telemetry for nine months. There was a continuous decline in nighttime breathing and heart rate, at constant T b, throughout the late summer and fall suggestive of an active metabolic suppression that developed progressively at night preceding the entrance into dormancy. During the day, however, the tegus still emerged to bask. In May, when the tegus made a <b>behavioural</b> <b>commitment</b> to dormancy, T b (day and night) fell to match burrow temperature, accompanied by a further reduction in f H and f R. Tegus, under the conditions of this study, did arouse periodically during dormancy. There was a complex interplay between changes in f H and T b associated with the direct effects of temperature and the indirect effects of thermoregulation, activity, and changes in metabolism. This interplay gave rise to a daily hysteresis in the f H/T b relationship reflective of the physiological changes associated with warming and cooling as preferred T b alternated between daytime and nighttime levels. The shape of the hysteresis curve varied with season along with changes in metabolic state and daytime and nighttime body temperature preferences...|$|R

A two-phase survey was conducted {{for a range of}} organisations from different industry sectors to collect empirical data to test the validity and reliability of the measurement model for the multidimensionality of partnership quality. The measurement model for partnership quality was confirmed by the results of the data analyses. This research also aimed to identify the significant relationships between these dimensions using a second generation multivariate analysis technique—partial least squares(PLS). The findings from results of the data analyses show that inter-organisational trust, shared business understanding and to a lesser extent, functional and dysfunctional conflict between the client organisation and the outsourcing vendor in an IT outsourcing relationship are the key determinants of partnership quality. The key outcome of high partnership quality between the client organisation and the outsourcing vendor in an IT outsourcing relationship is mutual beneficial sharing of risks and benefits. Commitment is confirmed as a multidimensional construct of behaviour and temporal/continuance commitment but is not is influenced by the other dimensions of partnership quality. Trust and shared business understanding are the key drivers in the IT outsourcing relationship ensuring that the sharing of risks and benefits are realised and conflict is minimised leading to a high quality and ultimately successful partnership between the client organisation and the outsourcing vendor. Furthermore <b>behavioural</b> <b>commitment</b> to the contractual obligations of an IT outsourcing relationship sustains an ongoing temporal commitment to the partnership between the client organisation and the outsourcing vendor...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePurpose A customer’s {{visit to}} a retail website is a {{critical}} “moment of truth” during which contemporary retailers attempt to simultaneously, during a single web navigation, capture customers’ attention, build rapport, and prompt them to act. By showing how to capture customer commitment {{over the course of}} a single website visit, the concept of customer website engagement, defined as “the process of developing cognitive, affective and <b>behavioural</b> <b>commitment</b> to an active relationship with the website”, addresses strategic concerns. Drawing from literature on engagement, the purpose of this paper is to consider how retail websites can engage customers during the course of a website navigation. A conceptual model of website customer engagement underpinned by relationship marketing and communication knowledge, shows how perceptions of the website’s exploration and sense-making potential can activate consumer engagement, and is then empirically tested. Design/methodology/approach Using survey data, measures of the four dimensions of engagement (interaction engagement, activity engagement, behavioural engagement, and communication engagement) and of three drivers are developed and validated. The model is tested empirically (n= 301) using structural equation modelling. Findings The results support the process conceptualisation of engagement, which identifies organismic as well as conative stages, and show the distinct roles played by perceptions of informational exploration, experiential exploration and sense-making in activating engagement. Practical implications The study provides online retailing practice with an organising framework enabling online retailing managers to consider how, depending on their product category and their size, they might (re) design their website to optimally produce customer engagement. Originality/value The study contributes to online marketing and retailing knowledge by showing the relevance of the concept of engagement as it pertains to customers’ single navigations on retail websites, and by empirically showing, through a parsimonious model, how engagement can be activated and unfol...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores {{whether the}} {{experience}} of political party membership can be enhanced for individual members whilst, at the same time, parties can increase membership productivity. This exploration is conducted via a central hypothesis: "Satisfaction with {{the experience of}} membership is a stronger predictor of commitment to a political party than partisanship. " An interdisciplinary approach drawing on marketing, nonprofit studies, organizational behaviour and political science is used to identify appropriate analytical frameworks for testing this hypothesis. A questionnaire survey of 1, 849 members of a political party, Plaid Cymru The Party of Wales, indicated that, in terms of <b>behavioural</b> <b>commitment,</b> one partisanship variable - values motivations - predicted whether members took part in any one activity. But two satisfaction variables - socialization and job satisfaction - predicted the numbers and types of activities in which members participated. Job satisfaction was also found to predict the making of donations. In respect of attitudinal commitment, more relationships were observed with partisanship variables than with satisfaction variables. The experience of membership was found to differ between demographic groups of members. Linguistic and membership density groups showed differing levels of overall satisfaction, gender groups showed differing levels of participation. The less affluent and less well-educated members of Plaid Cymru benefited disproportionately more from their membership than other groups; whilst middle-aged, affluent members contributed more to the party than they appeared to receive. The appropriateness of using communications tools for membership management is discussed. Specific communications strategies to aid recruitment, socialize members, raise political efficacy levels, and generate increased revenues are described. It is argued that these communications strategies will simultaneously deliver the benefits that members want and increase their propensity to participate. The actions that political parties can take towards improving the experience of membership and the potential management implications of these actions are described...|$|R

40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{relationship}} between employees' experiences of organisational downsizing and their subsequent work related attitudes. Measures of work attitudes included affective and <b>behavioural</b> <b>commitment,</b> turnover cognitions, trust in management, job security perceptions, job and work involvement, instrumentalism, and the degree to which employees regarded their job as a central life interest. Ten hypotheses were formulated and tested, with the general expectation being that downsizing experiences would be negatively related to the work attitudes question. A secondary aim of the research was to explore the role of a wide range of possible moderating variables in any observed relationship between downsizing experiences and employee work related attitudes, including employee age, tenure, job satisfaction, exposure to high-commitment HR work practices, the way in which the last downsizing experienced was conducted, and the time elapsed since the last downsizing experienced. Organisational downsizing was operationally defined, for the purposes of this study, as the intentional reduction by management of a firm's internal labour force by using voluntary or involuntary redundancies. Data collection was by means of a self-completion postal questionnaire sent late in 2002 to a random national sample of 2000 urban residents. Usable responses were obtained from 424 participants, who did not differ markedly from the survey population in terms of gender, ethnicity or age. Just over a third (33. 9 %) had never worked in an organisation that had downsized (a non-equivalent control group), 31. 4 % had experienced a downsizing (Survivors) and 34. 7 % had experienced a downsizing and lost a job through redundancy (Redundant). Tests of the hypotheses found clear relationships between the experience of downsizing and job security perceptions, instrumentalism, affective commitment, and trust in management, although not always in the directions predicted. Few moderator effects were identified, the most notable being that job security perceptions moderated the relationship between downsizing and trust in management, as well as affective commitment. Implications of these findings are discussed, together with their limitations. A theoretical model of the downsizing-work attitude relationships is also presented...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. Higher {{education}} {{is important to}} the country's economic growth. Due to globalisation, it is important for higher education institutions to keep up with change. The introduction of universities of technology in response to this places a new demand on academic institutions in South Africa, creating more occupational stress on employees. Other expectations, for example demands for more research and publication exert more pressure on staff, which escalates these stress levels. Workload of staff fluctuates between higher and lower and with this, a change of fluctuating periods of stress from acute to chronic is described. This chronic stress has a negative impact on the individuals' physical and psychological health, their interpersonal relationships at work and the quality of their work, as well as on workplace morale. The objectives of the study were to establish how occupational stress, ill health and commitment are conceptualised in the literature; to establish what the occupational stress levels of staff at a university of technology are and to assess the mutual relationships among occupational stress, organisational commitment and ill health of employees at the specific institution. The research method consisted of a brief literature review and an empirical study. A cross-sectional survey design was used. A stratified random sample was taken of academic and support staff at a specific university of technology (N = 334). The ASSET Organizational Stress Screening Tool and a biographical questionnaire were administered on the personnel. Cronbach alpha coefficients were used to determine the significance of dimensions of the ASSET. Exploratory factor analysis was used to investigate the factor structure of the occupational stress items of the ASSET. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to specify the relationship between the variables. Standard multiple regression analyses were used to assess whether occupational stress predicts ill health and organisational commitment. The results showed that two occupational stressors, namely control and work relationships were higher than the norm. Physical and psychological ill health was predicted by occupational stress due to job demands and lack of organisational support. Occupational stress because of job demands had a significant effect on both affective and <b>behavioural</b> <b>commitment</b> of employees. Recommendations for future research were made.

Given the profession's requirements to be confidential, independent and {{to act in the}} public's interest, {{there is a need for}} a model that addresses auditors' whistle-blowing intentions. This thesis presents a conceptual model on whistle-blowing intentions among external auditors, where individual-led antecedents influence whistle-blowing intentions, but are moderated by isomorphic and issue-specific factors. Survey questionnaires were administered to 226 external auditors, and 18 individual interviews as well as 2 focus groups were conducted in Barbados. Results indicated that individual antecedents (attitudes, perceived <b>behavioural</b> control, independence <b>commitment,</b> personal responsibility for reporting, and personal cost of reporting) were significantly related to internal whistle-blowing, but only perceived behavioural control was significantly related to external whistle-blowing. Partial support was found for the moderating effects of perceived organizational support, moral intensity, team norms and group cohesion on the relationships between the majority of the independent variables (attitudes, perceived <b>behavioural</b> control, independence <b>commitment,</b> personal responsibility for reporting and personal cost of reporting) and internal whistle-blowing. However, partial support was found for the moderating effects of perceived organizational support, moral intensity, team norms iii and group cohesion on the relationships between fewer independent variables and external whistle-blowing. Overall, respondents preferred anonymous internal channels of reporting, and showed a general reluctance to report externally. The presence of an open-door policy, ethics partners, hotline, on-going training and clearly defined policies could encourage whistle-blowing. Further implications for research and practice are discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceUniversity of the West IndiesGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} is to examine the impact of a Social Customer Relationship Management (SCRM) system on the development of customer engagement in the restaurant industry. This study is also aimed at investigating the impact of customer engagement on cognitive and affective <b>commitment,</b> <b>behavioural</b> loyalty, satisfaction, trust and involvement. We also expect to find a positive impact of customer engagement on other measurements such as revenue growth ratios, sales, frequency of visit, profitability, satisfaction, intentions to revisit, money spent per visit and word-of-mouth referral. In order to validate the model, a survey was administered to Osco! restaurant and Sarah B. bar patrons. The results confirmed the validity of the scale, as well as the profile of the customers. This first round of data collection also confirmed the existence of a positive and significant relationship between customer engagement and the following variables: cognitive and affective <b>commitment,</b> <b>behavioural</b> loyalty, satisfaction and trust. Then, following the implementation of the Social Customer Relationship Management (SCRM) system, a second survey was administered to the active members of the program. This confirmed the reliability of the scales once again and it highlighted the differences between the profiles of the customers and the SCRM members. The regression analysis also confirmed the positive and significant relationship between customer engagement and the following variables: behavioural loyalty, satisfaction and trust. The analysis of the financial results also confirms the impact of the Social Customer Relationship Management (SCRM) system on sales, revenue growth, profitability and average amount spent per visit...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a contemporary {{review of the}} term commitment from an organisational perspective. The paper highlights the typology of employee commitment and of organisational commitment. Organisational commitment is a subset of employee commitment, which is comprised of work commitment, career commitment and organisational commitment. Organisational commitment, in turn, can be subdivided into affective commitment, continuance commitment and normative commitment. As {{a combination of both}} attitudinal and <b>behavioural</b> approaches, organisational <b>commitment</b> is defined as employees acceptance, involvement and dedication (AID) towards achieving the organisations goals. It is the willingness of employees to accept organisational values, and goals, and to work towards achieving these; to be fully involved, and participate, in all the activities, both work and non-work related, of the organisation; and to dedicate time, and effort, towards the betterment of the organisation...|$|R
40|$|A {{dramatic}} {{increase in the number of}} organic farmers in Ireland since the introduction of financial support under successive agri-environmental programmes prompted us to investigate farmer motivations to convert to organic farming and to continue as organic farmers. An adapted Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) framework proved useful to investigate farmer motivations and behaviour. The findings support the TPB hypothesis in that <b>behavioural</b> intention (<b>commitment</b> to organic farming) was related to attitude, the influence of important others and the level of perceived behaviour control. The addition of self-identity and moral obligation measures in the regression increased the predictive power of the model, signifying that these two variables are important predictors of commitment. The organic farmers were segmented based on their level of commitment to organic farming, three segments were identified: wary, finance wary; and very committed. The findings point to an evolution in the type of organic farmer from a small-scale farmer very focused on environmental and agro-ecological issues to a larger-scale more commercially orientated farmer. However, the majority of full-time Irish organic farmers displayed a strong moral obligation to the environment and their continued commitment to organic farming was influenced by growing consumer demand for high quality healthy food products. Part-time organic farmers were found to be rather wary as to the future potential of organic farming.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a survey with public {{accountants}} in Barbados on their intention to report a superior’s unethical behaviour. Specifically, it investigates to what extent perceived organisational support (POS) in audit organisations would moderate Barbadian public accountants’ intentions to blow the whistle internally and externally. Results indicate that internal whistle-blowing intentions are significantly influenced by all five individual antecedents (attitudes, perceived <b>behavioural</b> control, independence <b>commitment,</b> personal responsibility for reporting and personal cost of reporting), and the influence of the antecedents is intensified when the level of POS is high. However, further results indicate that external whistle-blowing intentions are significantly influenced by only three individual-level antecedents viz. attitudes, perceived behavioural control and personal cost of reporting, and their influence is intensified when the level of POS is low. The results suggest that POS is an important mechanism for controlling behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. Most {{employers}} {{agree that}} the effectiveness and success of their organisations depend on the effective utilisation of their human resources. Ill health in the workplace {{is a threat to}} optimal productivity, reduced absenteeism, provision of sustainable employee benefits, a motivated workforce, staff retention and maximisation of profits. Burnout and engagement are therefore important fields of investigation in the industrial psychology field. The aim of this study was to: test a model of work-related well-being; develop and evaluate a resilience intervention programme for a large financial services institution in South Africa. Article 1 used a cross-sectional survey design. The participants were predominantly in the administrative, call centre and IT divisions (N = 192). Article 2 was the development of a resilience model, which was based on the integration of thinking from an extensive literature review by the researcher. Article 3 used an experimental design, with a control group (n= 51) and an experimental group («= 55). Information was collected in a longitudinal research. The research method {{for each of the three}} articles of this study consisted of a brief literature review and an empirical study. The measuring instruments used in this study were the Maslach Burnout Inventory - General Survey (MBI-GS), Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES), Job Demands-Resources Scale (JD-RS), Health subscales, Organisational Commitment subscales, the ASSET questionnaire, the Life Orientation Test - Revised (LOT-R) and a biographical questionnaire. In both article 1 and article 3, descriptive statistics were computed to describe the data; as were Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients to specify the relationship between the variables. In article 1, multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predicted by the independent variables. In article 3, paired-samples f-tests were used to determine the difference in results for year 1 and year 2. Article 1 showed the central role that low optimism plays in contributing to burnout, and high optimism plays in work engagement. Interestingly, high social support was linked to increased cynicism, whilst low social support contributed to dedication. Burnout contributed to both physical and psychological ill health. Dedication and low cynicism contributed to affective commitment, whilst engagement and low cynicism contributed to <b>behavioural</b> <b>commitment.</b> Article 2 was the development of a multidimensional, proactive coping approach which consistently strives to develop and enhance the individual's resilience coping reservoir pools (mental, spiritual, socio-emotional and physical) leading to improved resilience, wellness and quality of life. Each reservoir pool has activities that enhance the fitness of the individual, namely physical (rest and relaxation, exercise and nutrition), mental (stimuli, reflection and empowering thinking), spiritual (coat of arms, pay it forward and gratitude), socio-emotional (breaking destructive relationships and nurturing relationships, responsibility). Article 3 's results showed that the resilience intervention resulted in a statistically significant difference decrease in psychological ill health. Recommendations for future research were made.

40|$|Vertebrates exhibit varied {{behavioural}} {{and physiological}} tactics to promote reproductive success. We examined mechanisms that could enable female loggerhead turtles to undertake nesting activities and maintain seasonal reproduction despite recent shark injuries of varying severity. We proposed that endocrinal mechanisms that regulate both a turtle's stress response and reproductive ability are modified to promote successful and continued reproduction. Irrespective {{of the degree}} of injury, females did not exhibit increased levels of the stress hormone corticosterone, nor decreased levels of the reproductive steroid testosterone; hormone responses consistent with stress. When exposed to a capture stressor, females with shark injury did not exhibit any greater corticosterone response than controls. In addition, breeding females showed a reduced corticosterone stress response compared to non-breeding females. Reduced endocrinal responses following shark injury, and during breeding in general may, in part, enable females to maintain <b>behavioural</b> and physiological <b>commitment</b> to reproduction...|$|R
