According to Sandars, Huskisson congratulated him on the achievement of his vision, and said to Sandars that he [...] "must be one of the happiest men in the world". William Holmes, the Chief Whip, then called Huskisson to one side. He suggested that, with the Duke of Wellington in a particularly good mood owing to the cheering crowds which had lined the route, it might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> for Huskisson and the Duke to meet and try to arrange a reconciliation.|$|E

[...] 30,000 Arabs, mostly intellectuals {{and members of the}} social elite, had fled Palestine in the months {{following}} the approval of the partition plan, undermining the social infrastructure of Palestine. A 10 May 1948 Time magazine article states: [...] "Said one British official in Jerusalem last week: 'The whole effendi class has gone. It is remarkable how many of the younger ones are suddenly deciding that this might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> to resume their studies at Oxford....'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Why, I was {{thinking}} that this evening would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time,</b> Steerforth, when they are all sitting round the fire. I should like you to see it when it's snug, it's such a curious place.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{names of}} the persons to whom these sums marked [...] "debt of honour" [...] are due.' His reply came quickly, and was a little aggressive; he thought this might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> to make a bluff: ...|$|E

"Then {{it ought}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> to pick up land cheap, and I want you to find a broker who'll ask Davies what he'll take {{for two or three}} {{mortgages}} he holds on Allenwood.

6000|$|Lady Fawn was gracious, {{the girls}} were hospitable, {{and he found himself}} made very welcome amidst all the women at the tea-table. Not a word was said about Lizzie Eustace.

60|$|The little {{community}} soon assembled, {{the prior}} excepted, and the supper was served.

6000|$|... "It is true," [...] I said to myself, with an inward laugh, [...] "I carry no glove or {{delicate}} handkerchief bound upon my visor--" [...] but at {{this point}} my mind wandered.
