40|$|Introduction: Specific fuel {{consumption}} (SFC) for the boiler {{is the most}} important performance indicators of the work, both in the current and projected periods. The technical installation of metering stations of thermal energy from the boiler made it possible to evaluate the actual SFC over the period of interest with sufficient accuracy. However, the problem of controlling modes for operation of <b>boiler</b> <b>units,</b> which allows obtaining the minimum SFS remained unresolved. This paper presents the algorithm of finding the optimal group SFC for the boiler depending on the outside temperature. This approach is based on the linear programming method. Materials and Methods: The study of the group specific {{fuel consumption}} was carried out using the results of technological audit in Ruzaevka (Republic of Mordovia) in 2016 â 2017. For analysis we selected two district boiler with loads more 10 Gcal/hour. We used the general scientific methods and methods of linear programming. Results: To reveal the dependence of the effect of the order of operation of <b>boiler</b> <b>units</b> in their group SFC we developed an algorithm and a program. This problem can be solved by linear programming methods. The algorithm for finding the optimal group SFC represents a sequence of steps. The algorithm is implemented using a spreadsheet program in two boilers in Ruzaevka. We presented the calculated minimum, maximum and average SFC for the production of thermal energy from each of the boiler depending on the outdoor temperature. Discussion and Conclusions: One of the most effective and low-cost measures to reduce SFC for the heat energy from the boiler is to increase the accuracy of the compliance regimes of burning and strict compliance with the order of the boilers. The problem of determining the optimal order of operation of <b>boiler</b> <b>units</b> with a variety of individual SFC for the production of thermal energy from boilers is solved by linear programming.
