50|$|A dial or vernier <b>bore</b> <b>gauge</b> {{measures}} a <b>bore</b> directly. The <b>gauge</b> {{has three}} symmetrical anvils that protrude from the gauge body that {{are connected to}} the dial or micrometer mechanism. As the knob is rotated it moves the anvils in or out with respect to the measurements. The knob usually has a slipping mechanism to take the feel out of the device and increase reliability between measurements. The measurement given is the mean diameter of the three anvils, and is usually good to 0.001 mm.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The use of {{measurement}} system Repeatability and Reproducibility (R&R) studies is widespread in industry. Such analyses have become mandatory for many companies who supply {{the automotive industry}} and is now {{an integral part of}} the QS 9000 automotive industry standard. R&R study allow one to estimate the contribution of variation attributable to the measurement system itself and is used to ensure that a company measurement system is acceptable. If the measurement system R&R study indicate that the recorded measurements may be unreliable, this may impact all subsequent analyses, e. g. control charts, capability analyses etc. It is the aim of this paper to address such issues and to show a measurement system R&R case study that was made in a major automotive company. A measurement system used to measure a bore diameter of a part, having a specification of 18. 1 to 18. 3 mm was to be evaluated. Ten parts have been selected for measurements by three operators. Each part was measured twice with a dial <b>bore</b> <b>gauge.</b> Because R&R value was between 10 % and 30 %, it had required further analysis to find the sources {{of measurement}} error. The supposition was that the dial <b>bore</b> <b>gauge</b> was not adequate to measure this bore diameter, so it was replaced by an internal micrometer and another measurement system R&R study was made. The conclusion was that the new measuring system is excellent...|$|R

5000|$|This writer, then a Federal special agent, {{observed}} James Cummings and {{his estranged}} wife arguing loudly outside the Shreveport bankruptcy court {{on the morning of}} December 16. This writer commented to two US DOJ Anti Trust attorney's at the time that there was [...] "going to be a killing" [...] out there, referring to the loud argument. The Attorney's from the Dallas Division ATR office acknowledged having heard the commotion. Later that morning, after the bankruptcy hearing, James Cummings left the Federal Court House ahead of Vidrine and Cummings' estranged wife, crossed the street, and retrieved a 12 <b>gauge</b> <b>shot</b> gun from his vehicle in the presence of his young teenage son. Cummings fired the 12 <b>gauge</b> <b>shot</b> gun 3 times at Vidrine and dropped him {{on the steps of the}} court house. A deputy U.S. Marshal returning from lunch apprehended Cummings there and then. With only the morbid sense of humor shared by law enforcement agents, this writer opined that Cummings only had 3 rounds in the shotgun because it was plugged for bird season. Prior to his death that day, Virdrine was informally interviewed in the court house lobby by the ATR attorneys as they were investigating highway bid rigging at the time, and were invited to visit Vidrine at a future date at his home in Lafayette. Clearly that meeting never took place.4 ...|$|R

25|$|After the {{introduction}} of cartridge-firing firearms, the LeMat system appeared in pinfire, but this version is exceedingly rare. A centerfire version in 12mm Perrin or 11mm Chamelot-Delvigne, with a 24 <b>gauge</b> <b>shot</b> barrel, was made in later years in Belgium. While having better sales than its pinfire relative, the centerfire LeMat also had no real commercial success due to {{the invention of the}} double-action system. With both weapons, loading was accomplished via a loading gate located at the 4 o'clock position for the cylinder, and by swinging the breech of the shot barrel up and left.|$|R

5000|$|There are two {{styles of}} small-hole gauges: full-ball and half-ball. The full-ball gauges {{are easier to}} set {{correctly}} and maintain, {{under the pressure of}} measurement, a better representation of the <b>bore.</b> Half-ball <b>gauges</b> tend to spring just a little bit, and this may be enough to make a measurement incorrect. A lighter [...] "touch" [...] is required to accurately use the half-ball gauges.|$|R
5000|$|To measure larger diameters, you may use {{extended}} beam gauges. It {{is designed}} to measure internal and external diameters. The major challenge is handling these gauges is slightly difficult compared to other <b>bore</b> <b>gauges.</b> It should be lightweight, have low coefficient of thermal expansion, high modulus and stiffness. Mostly we use low carbon fiber or aluminium. It has stem with ball at both ends. The length range of the stem depends upon {{the width of the}} part. [...] In order to measure the diameter of the bore, place the beam at one end and slide the other end on the diameter and watch the dial indicator. The values initially increases and at one point starts decreasing; stop that point, it is called max point on the circle. That is the diameter of the component. Repeat the procedure in 3 different places and get the average value of the diameter of the component. This is the most common way to measure the larger bore. It is available in different ranges; normally you can use this from 300 mm to 4000 mm for external diameter.|$|R
50|$|The duck {{shooting}} season {{opens in}} the first weekend of May and runs for 3 months. A licence must be obtained from Fish and Game New Zealand every season, {{at a cost of}} $80NZD (2010 Adult). These can be purchased from most outdoor sporting stores. Strict laws govern the number of birds which are allowed to be taken daily and may change between provinces. Laws also state that ducks must be shot with a shotgun while on the wing (flying). Although a mercy shot on the ground or water is an ethical responsibility of the hunter should a bird be injured during the initial shooting. In 2006 lead shot was banned from use while using 10 or 12 <b>gauge</b> <b>shot</b> on game birds within 200 m of any waterway. Nontoxic shot, mainly steel, is being used as a replacement.|$|R

40|$|For online {{quality control}} of car engine production, {{pneumatic}} measurement instrument plays an unshakeable role in measuring diameters inside engine block {{because of its}} portability and high-accuracy. To the limitation of its measuring principle, however, the working space between the pneumatic device and measured surface {{is too small to}} require manual operation. This lowers the measuring efficiency and becomes an obstacle to perform automatic measurement. In this article, a high-speed, automatic measuring system is proposed {{to take the place of}} pneumatic devices by using a laser-based measuring unit. The measuring unit is considered as a set of several measuring modules, where each of them acts like a single <b>bore</b> <b>gauge</b> and is made of four laser triangulation sensors (LTSs), which are installed on different positions and in opposite directions. The spatial relationship among these LTSs was calibrated before measurements. Sampling points from measured shaft holes can be collected by the measuring unit. A unified mathematical model was established for both calibration and measurement. Based on the established model, the relative pose between the measuring unit and measured workpiece does not impact the measuring accuracy. This frees the measuring unit from accurate positioning or adjustment, and makes it possible to realize fast and automatic measurement. The proposed system and method were finally validated by experiments...|$|R

50|$|Cannulae are hollow {{flexible}} {{tubes of}} varying <b>bore,</b> usually 16-22 <b>gauge</b> thick. They are commonly made {{of stainless steel}} or PTFE for chemical resistance. Stainless steel cannulae are usually 2-3 feet long, due to their relative inflexibility, while PTFE cannulae can be much shorter. The ends are usually sharp and non-coring, allowing them to easily pierce a rubber septum, without being clogged by rubber particles. Flat ends may be chosen on occasion, {{because they tend to}} provide more complete transfer of fluids.|$|R
50|$|Small-hole gauges {{require a}} {{slightly}} different technique to the telescopic gauges, the small hole gauge is initially set smaller than the bore to be measured. It is then inserted into the bore and adjusted by rotating the knurled knob at the base, until light pressure is felt when the gauge is slightly moved in the <b>bore.</b> The <b>gauge</b> is then removed and measured with a caliper or micrometer. To accurately detect the maximal distance between {{the two halves of}} the gauge head, move the head of the gauge around while making the measurement to insure you get the maximal reading. Grasp the gauge near the head to aid in your maneuvering of the gauge while adjusting the micrometer so it just stops the gauge's motion at one spot only. A bit of practice will quickly give you the idea.|$|R
