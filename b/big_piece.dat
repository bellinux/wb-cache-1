25|$|In 1991, a sixty-five-year-old {{advertising}} executive with no prior history of crime or violence after an argument strangled his wife, {{opened the window}} and threw her out of their 12th-floor apartment. His defense team had a structural brain scan done using MRI and PET scan. The images showed a <b>big</b> <b>piece</b> missing from the prefrontal cortex of the brain, i.e., a subarachnoid cyst was growing in his left frontal lobe. The defense team used these images to argue that Weinstein had an impaired ability to regulate his emotions and make rational decisions. The team went with an insanity defense, and the prosecution and defense agreed to a plea of manslaughter. As a result, Weinstein was given a seven-year sentence {{in contrast to the}} twenty-five-year sentence he would have served if he had been convicted of second-degree murder.|$|E

500|$|Cellador Productions of Bangalore {{worked on}} the film's sound design; Nixon George and Rajeesh K. R. {{designed}} its soundscape. Since Maheshinte Prathikaram was set in Prakash City in Idukki, it required natural sounds which blended with the dialogue and music instead of dominating them. George and Rajeesh recorded in all the locations and found it of great help during the final editing process. Creating sound effects for the climactic fight was difficult: [...] "We used a <b>big</b> <b>piece</b> of meat to produce the sound effects of punches and kicks. It {{took a long time}} and a lot of trial and error". Editor Saiju Sreedharan was the film's colourist, correcting the colour grading and developing its digital intermediate.|$|E

500|$|Although Nielsen came {{to compose}} mainly at the piano, he only {{composed}} directly for it occasionally {{over a period}} of 40 years, creating works often with a distinctive style which slowed their international acceptance. Nielsen's own piano technique, an echo of which is probably preserved in three wax cylinders marked [...] "Carl Nielsen" [...] at the State Archives in Aarhus, seems to have been mediocre. Reviewing the 1969 recording of works by the pianist John Ogdon, John Horton commented on the early pieces: [...] "Nielsen's technical resources hardly measure up to the grandeur of his designs", whilst characterising the later pieces as [...] "major works which can stand comparison with his symphonic music". The anti-romantic tone of the Symphonic Suite, Op. 8 (1894) was described by a later critic as [...] "nothing less than a clenched fist straight {{in the face of all}} established musical convention". In Nielsen's words, the Chaconne, Op. 32 (1917) was [...] "a really <b>big</b> <b>piece,</b> and I think effective". It is not only inspired by the work of Bach, especially the chaconne for solo violin, but also by the virtuoso piano arrangements of Bach's music by composers such as Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms and Ferruccio Busoni. Also on a large scale, and from the same year, is the Theme and Variations, Op. 41, in which critics have discerned the influences of Brahms and also of Max Reger, of whom Nielsen had earlier written to a friend [...] "I think that the public will be utterly unable to grasp Reger's work and yet I am a lot more sympathetic towards his efforts than towards... Richard Strauss".|$|E

2500|$|During the {{dismantling}} of the Ottoman Empire after the war, most of Ottoman Syria came under the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon and most of Ottoman Iraq came under British mandate. Heated and prolonged negotiations ensued regarding which companies could invest in the Turkish Petroleum Company. The TPC was granted exclusive oil exploration rights to Mesopotamia in 1925. The discovery of a large oil reserve at Baba Gurgur provided the impetus to conclude negotiations and in July 1928 an agreement, called the [...] "Red Line Agreement", was signed which determined which oil companies could invest in TPC and reserved 5% of the shares for Gulbenkian. The name of the company was changed to the Iraq Petroleum Company in 1929. The Pasha had actually given Gulbenkian the entire Iraqi oil concession. Gulbenkian, however, saw advantage in divesting the vast majority of his concession so that corporations would be able to develop the whole. Gulbenkian grew wealthy on the remainder. He reputedly said, [...] "Better a small piece of a big pie, than a <b>big</b> <b>piece</b> of a small one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Muslim luthras {{are present}} in Pakistan. They claim that their {{ancestors}} were related to aror sindh and they belong to Khashatriya. They link themselves to utradi aroras. After attack of arbis on Sindh, they migrated to Punjab. In Punjab they settled in Multan, Jhung and Lahore. Majority of Luthras settled in areas around the river Chenab. Majority of them were cultivators. In Laliyan, small town in Jhung, luthras used to cultivate a <b>big</b> <b>piece</b> of land. During Mughal era, especially during period of Aurangzeb, many Hindu tribes converted to Islam. Especially Rajput , jutts and people of many other castes converted to Islam. Llilyan was the main residence of Luthras and they were strict Hindus. Despite of that, some luthras converted to Islam. Following the custom, they accepted Islam {{in the presence of}} Bukhari sayyeds of Uch. After converting to Islam, Hindu luthras and Muslim luthras still lived together. After some time, Muslim luthras moved to Multan, Ram nagar (currently known as Rasool nagar), Gujranwala and Lahore. They opted trading as their profession. Even today luthras are prominent and integral part of society.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{technological}} advances {{have been made}} between the present day and the 31st century. The ability to keep heads alive in jars was invented by Ron Popeil (who has a guest cameo in [...] "A <b>Big</b> <b>Piece</b> of Garbage"), which has resulted in many historical figures and current celebrities being present, including Groening himself; this became the writers' device to feature and poke fun at contemporary celebrities in the show. Curiously, several of the preserved heads shown are those {{of people who were}} already dead well before the advent of this technology; {{one of the most prominent}} examples of this anomaly is Earth president Richard Nixon, who died in 1994 and appears in numerous episodes. The Internet, while being fully immersive and encompassing all senses— even featuring its own digital world (similar to Tron or The Matrix)— is slow and largely consists of pornography, pop-up ads, and [...] "filthy" [...] (or Filthy Filthy) chat rooms. Some of it is edited to include educational material ostensibly for youth. Television is still a primary form of entertainment. Self-aware robots are a common sight, and are the main cause of global warming thanks to the exhaust from their alcohol-powered systems. The wheel is obsolete (no one but Fry even seems to recognize the design), having been forgotten and replaced by hover cars and a network of large, clear pneumatic transportation tubes.|$|E

40|$|A quasiplane f(V) is {{the image}} of an n-dimensional Euclidean {{subspace}} V of R^N (1 ≤ n≤ N- 1) under a quasiconformal map f: R^N→ R^N.

One main novelty of these results is that we analyze quasiplanes in arbitrary codimension N-n. To establish the <b>big</b> <b>pieces</b> criterion, we prove new extension theorems for "almost affine" maps, which are of independent interest.
