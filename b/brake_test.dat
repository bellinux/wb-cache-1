25|$|A serious {{incident}} occurred on 11 June 2007, during a <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> which {{was part of}} the annual examination of the cable, when an empty cabin fell off the cable and crashed into a hilly area near Chek Lap Kok South Road. Despite {{the fact that there were}} no injuries caused, an investigation resulted in the operating company and its CEO being charged with criminal negligence related to the incident, although the CEO's case was later delayed, and the charges against him eventually dropped altogether. Skyrail-ITM was removed as operator, fined HK$5,000, and the MTR Corporation took over operational responsibility. The line remained out of service until 23 December when it underwent one week of trial run involving 40,000 visitors riding for free. It reopened officially on 31 December 2007.|$|E
25|$|Harding {{left the}} lead {{locomotive}} No.5017 running to keep air pressure supplied to the train's air brakes and also applied {{a number of}} hand brakes. Yves Bourdon, a member of MMA's Board of Directors, stated that the air brakes of all locomotives and freight cars had been activated, as well as hand brakes on 5 locomotives and 10 of the 72 freight cars. However, the TSB agrees with a July 6 statement to police by the train's engineer that he set hand brakes on just the five locomotive engines, a buffer car, and a car housing the remote control apparatus. The engineer also attempted a <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> but incorrectly left the locomotive air brakes on; this gave the false impression that the hand brakes alone would hold the train.|$|E

2500|$|A Commission of Inquiry {{investigated}} the crash. Justice René P. Foisy, Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, held 56 days of public hearings and received evidence from 150 parties. [...] The inquiry report was published on January 22, 1987. [...] Instead of condemning any one individual, it instead condemned what Foisy {{described as a}} [...] "railroader culture" [...] that prized loyalty and productivity {{at the expense of}} safety. [...] As an example of this disregard of safety, it was noted that the crew of that train had boarded the locomotive at Edson [...] "on the fly". [...] While the locomotive was moving slowly through the yard, the new crew would jump on and the previous crew would jump off. [...] While this method of changing crews saved time and fuel, it was a flagrant violation of safety regulations requiring a stationary <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> after a crew change. [...] Management claimed to be unaware of this practice, even though it was quite common. In regards to engineer Hudson, the Foisy Commission concluded it was a possibility that Hudson had either fallen asleep at the controls or had suffered a heart attack or stroke in light of his extremely poor health, leading to the collision. The commission further criticized CN's ineffective monitoring of Hudson's health condition: ...|$|E

40|$|Objective: This paper aims at {{identifying}} {{the most significant}} measures in two perception—response (PR) tests performed at a driving simulator: a <b>braking</b> <b>test</b> and a lateral skid test, which was developed in this work. Methods: 48 subjects (26 females and 22 males) {{with a mean age}} of 24. 9 ± 3. 0 years were enrolled for this study. They were asked to perform a drive on the driving simulator at the University of Pisa (Italy) following a specific test protocol, including 8 – 10 <b>braking</b> <b>tests</b> and 8 – 10 lateral skid tests. Driver input signals and vehicle model signals were recorded during the drives and analysed to extract some measures, such as the reaction time, the first response time, etc. Following a statistical procedure (based on ANOVA and post-hoc tests), all test measures (3 for the <b>braking</b> <b>test</b> and 8 for the lateral skid test) were analysed in terms of statistically significant differences among different drivers. The presented procedure allows to evaluate the capability of a given test to distinguish among different drivers. Results: In the <b>braking</b> <b>test,</b> the reaction time showed a high dispersion within the results of the single drivers, leading to just 4. 8...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} and comparison of the braking distance and the braking deceleration of the tractor Zetor Forterra 12441 and the towed trailer BSS 10 in relation to its load. For a complex analysis, the measurement of air pressure in front of and behind the load air pressure regulator of the trailer was performed during the <b>brake</b> <b>tests</b> as well. The work also includes a description of the current vehicle braking systems, methods of performing <b>brake</b> <b>testing</b> and legislative requirements on <b>brake</b> <b>testing.</b> There is also the methodology of comparative tests themselves and their specifications described in the thesis. The values achieved by the measurement are confronted both with the legislative regulations valid {{until the end of}} 2015 and the regulation newly valid from 1 st January 2016. The analysis of the measured values shows that the braking distance of the set is lengthening with increasing the weight of the trailer load...|$|R
