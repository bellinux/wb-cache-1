Using these lines, three F(1) -derived double haploid populations that comprised 194 double haploid lines (DHLs) of 'WPG 8412 ' x 'Stirling', 116 DHLs of 'WPG 8412 ' x 'Pompadour' and 206 DHLs of 'Pompadour' x 'Stirling' were tested against these two isolates.

Although not all crops were {{surveyed}} in each year, the surveys provide a good picture of changes in disease spectra over the years. The most dramatic change in spring <b>barley</b> <b>disease</b> has been the almost complete disappearance of Blumeria graminis (mildew) and its replacement as the dominant disease by Rhynchosporium secalis (leaf blotch).

The disease spectrum of winter barley was more consistent from year to year, with Rhynchosporium secalis as the most common pathogen. Barley yellow dwarf virus was relatively severe in 1984, but in no other years. In winter wheat, there was a major change with the almost complete eclipse of Phaeosphaeria nodorum leaf blotch by Mycosphaerella graminicola (septoria tritici blotch).

Leaf fluorescence and canopy reflectance were weekly measured by a portable fluorescence sensor and spectroradiometer, respectively.

The analysis of 58 barley genotypes revealed a large linkage block at the Rrs 2 locus extending over several hundred kb which is present only in Rrs 2 carrying cultivars. Due to the lack of recombination in the mapping population and the presence of a Rrs 2 -specific linkage block, we assume a local chromosomal rearrangement (alien introgression or inversion) in Rrs 2 carrying varieties. The variety analysis led to the discovery of eight SNPs which were diagnostic for the Rrs 2 phenotype.

In the present study we report on the targeted development of a microsatellite marker to a <b>barley</b> <b>disease</b> resistance gene. The method includes the following steps: (1) pooling DNA samples from a segregating population based on the principle of bulked-segregant analysis; (2) digesting the pooled DNAs and ligating adaptors; (3) selectively amplifying and identifying polymorphic microsatellites; and (4) developing primers for the microsatellite associated with the targeted trait.

This marker showed polymorphism in four breeding populations segregating for true loose smut resistance. In three of these populations, genetic distance between the microsatellite and the true loose smut resistance gene varied from 8. 6 to 10. 3 cM.

Resistance to three net form net blotch (P. teres f. teres) single spore isolates was evaluated at the seedling stage in the greenhouse and at the adult plant stage under field conditions during three years. Days to heading and plant height were scored to assess their influence on disease severity. At the seedling stage, three to four quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with resistance were found per isolate used. A major, putatively novel QTL was identified on chromosome 5 H, accounting for 23 - 48 % of the genetic variation. Additional QTL explaining between 12 and 16. 5 % were found on chromosomes 4 H, 5 H, 6 H and 7 H, with the one on 6 H being race-specific.

40|$|Abstract Background Although ion fluxes are {{considered}} to {{be an integral part of}} signal transduction during responses to pathogens, only a few ion channels are known to participate in the plant response to infection. CNGC 4 is a disease resistance-related cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel. Arabidopsis thaliana CNGC 4 mutants hlm 1 and dnd 2 display an impaired hypersensitive response (HR), retarded growth, a constitutively active salicylic acid (SA) -mediated pathogenesis-related response and elevated resistance against bacterial pathogens. Barley CNGC 4 shares 67 % aa identity with AtCNGC 4. The barley mutant nec 1 comprising of a frame-shift mutation of CNGC 4 displays a necrotic phenotype and constitutively over-expresses PR- 1, yet it is not known what effect the nec 1 mutation has on barley resistance against different types of pathogens. Results nec 1 mutant accumulated high amount of SA and hydrogen peroxide compared to parental cv. Parkland. Experiments investigating nec 1 disease resistance demonstrated positive effect of nec 1 mutation on non-host resistance against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) at high inoculum density, whereas at normal Pst inoculum concentration nec 1 resistance did not differ from wt. In contrast to augmented P. syringae resistance, penetration resistance against biotrophic fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh), the causal agent of powdery mildew, was not altered in nec 1. The nec 1 mutant significantly over-expressed race non-specific Bgh resistance-related genes BI- 1 and MLO. Induction of BI- 1 and MLO suggested putative involvement of nec 1 in race non-specific Bgh resistance, therefore the effect of nec 1 on mlo- 5 -mediated Bgh resistance was assessed. The nec 1 / mlo- 5 double mutant was as resistant to Bgh as Nec 1 / mlo- 5 plants, suggesting that nec 1 did not impair mlo- 5 race non-specific Bgh resistance. Conclusions Together, the results suggest that nec 1 mutation alters activation of systemic acquired resistance-related physiological markers and non-host resistance in barley, while not changing rapid localized response during compatible interaction with host pathogen. Increased resistance of nec 1 against non-host pathogen Pst suggests that nec 1 mutation may affect certain aspects of <b>barley</b> <b>disease</b> resistance, while it remains to be determined, if the effect on disease resistance is a direct response to changes in SA signaling. </p...|$|E

To date, only two P. graminea race-specific resistance genes are known: Rdg 1 a, identified in cultivar Vada, and Rdg 2 a, identified in cv. Thibaut. Rdg 2 a confers immunity to at least three different P. graminea monoconidian isolates, including the most widespread and virulent Italian isolate Dg 2, but it is overcome by Dg 5. The aim of the present work was to isolate this gene, characterize the Rdg 2 a locus and its evolution and mine the bases of Rdg 2 a-mediated resistance. In a previous analysis the map-based cloning and the sequencing of the Rdg 2 a locus were carried out. Three homolog R genes encoding CC-NB-LRR proteins, that represent the majior class of resistance proteins, were identified at the locus and were named as Nbs 1 -Rdg 2 a, Nbs 2 -Rdg 2 a and Nbs 3 -Rdg 2 a (Bulgarelli et al., 2010). To determine which of the three genes is the Rdg 2 a gene, we started the research investigating their structure. RACE analyses showed that for the third candidate (Nbs 3 -Rdg 2 a) alternative splicing processes determine the synthesis of severly truncated and probably non-functional proteins. This allowed us to excluded Nbs 3 - Rdg 2 a from acting in resistance to isolate Dg 2. By means RT-PCRs {{on a pair of}} Near Isogenic Lines (NIL) that differ only for alleles at the Rdg 2 a locus (susceptible cv. Mirco and its resistant NIL, NIL 3876), we demonstrated that both Nbs 1 -Rdg 2 a and Nbs 2 -Rdg 2 a are transcribed in embryos (where the resistance takes place) and leaf tissues of the resistant line, but they are not expressed in the susceptible nearisogenic phenotype. Sequencing of the Mirco alleles revealed rearrangements in the putative promoter regions: two insertions, one next to a putative TATA-box element and the other, carrying terminal inverted repeats, in the 5 ’ UTR, for Nbs 1 -rdg 2 a, and a deletion just at the level of a MITE-like element, present in Thibaut Nbs 2 -Rdg 2 a, for Nbs 2 -rdg 2 a. It is likely that these changes represent the cause of the lacking of expression of these genes in the susceptible genotype. Moreover, qRT-PCRs showed that Nbs 1 -Rdg 2 a transcription was un-responsive to P. graminea infection, while Nbs 2 -Rdg 2 a transcripts increased during the first stages of infection. However, Nbs 2 -Rdg 2 a mRNA abundance was significantly lower than that of Nbs 1 -Rdg 2 a. To define which gene is the Rdg 2 a gene, a complementation assay was conducted. Susceptible cv. Golden Promise was transformed by agoinfiltration with each gene independently, under the control of its native promoter. Interestingly, the rescue of Dg 2 -resistance was observed only when plants were transformed with Nbs 1 -Rdg 2 a (90 - 100 % of resistance), suggesting that this gene is Rdg 2 a. Comparing the sequences of the three genes at the Rdg 2 a locus, we found that similarly to other R genes, Rdg 2 a underwent to diversifying selection, according to a model in which resistance genes co-evolves with pathogen effector(s) gene(s). The fact that the Rdg 2 a locus contains a gene cluster of highly similar sequences has most likely contributed to significative rearrangements during evolution, probably derived from unequal crossovers resulting in sequence exchange between paralogs and, possibly, in the generation of recombinant genes, as well as to expansion/contraction of gene copy number. Regarding this last case, we have also characterized the rdg 2 a locus of the susceptible cv. Morex. Morex rdg 2 a locus carries two deletions and the rdg 2 a allele might derived from an un-equal crossingover between Rdg 2 a and Nbs 2 -Rdg 2 a ancestors that led to a reduction of the number of the gene family members. Most resistance proteins function through inducing a Programmed Cell Death (PCD) that lead to a Hypersensitive Response (HR) {{at the level of the}} infected cells. Histological analyses using the TUNEL method did not reveal any significative difference in PCD between infected embryos of resistant and susceptible varieties and the number of cells undergoing PCD was transcurable. These finding let us to conclude that the Rdg 2 a-mediated resistance does not involve HR but it is most likely based on the strengthening of physical and chemical barriers in the cell walls and intercellular spaces of the embryo tissues. In conclusion, we identified, cloned and characterized the first resistance gene active against a seed-borne disease; importantly, the gene belongs to the poorly represented class of R genes which does not trigger a hypersensitive responce...|$|E

The expression profiles characteristic of each gene cluster were very similar in both barley–P. t. f. teres and barley–P. t. f. maculata interactions, indicating that resistance to both pathogens could be mediated by induction of the same group of DR genes. Chromosomal map locations for 21 DR genes were identified using four doubled-haploid mapping populations.

Additionally, some DR genes appeared to co-localize with loci harbouring known resistance genes or quantitative trait loci for net blotch resistance on chromosomes 6 H and 7 H, as well as loci associated with resistance to other <b>barley</b> <b>diseases.</b> The DR genes are discussed with respect to their map locations and potential functional role in contributing to net blotch disease resistance.

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Spot blotch, caused by Cochliobolus sativus, {{is an important}} foliar <b>disease</b> of <b>barley.</b> The <b>disease</b> has been controlled for over 40 years through the deployment of cultivars with durable resistance derived from the line NDB 112. Pathotypes of C. sativus with virulence for the NDB 112 resistance have been detected in Canada; thus, many commercial cultivars are vulnerable to spot blotch epidemics. To increase the diversity of spot blotch resistance in cultivated barley, we evaluated 318 diverse wild barley accessions comprising the Wild Barley Diversity Electronic supplementary material The online {{version of this article}} (doi: 10. 1007 /s 11032 - 010 - 9402 - 8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users...|$|R

Their virulence spectra were determined using 11 barley cultivars. Cultivars exhibited a continuous range of response from very susceptible to moderately resis-tant but none was immune from the disease. A cluster analysis indicated that the isolates exhibited distinct dif-ferential virulence patterns with three groups. Mean dis-ease rating of 4. 37 was the separation point between avirulent and virulent reactions. Isolate CRR 16 had the highest mean virulence with lowest variance across all cultivars; and thus it was proposed to {{be considered as a}} physiological race. To incorporate adequate levels of re-sistance into future <b>barley</b> cultivars, <b>disease</b> evaluations should be made with Cochliobolus sativus isolates that express the full spectrum of virulence found in Syria...|$|R
40|$|Disease causing fungi {{are a major}} {{potential}} threat to yield in both organic and conventional cereal production, and generally several different species of pathogenic fungi are found together on the same plants in the field. This PhD thesis concludes that interaction between different fungal species may influence total disease levels and often via negative effects, such that less disease is observed where several diseases occur together relative where they are found individually. 	Such potential interaction effects have often been ignored in the past, as plant diseases have traditionally been studied as single independent events. The thesis provides an important review of available literature on the subject; which considers the theoretical background for analysing foliar disease interactions as well as previously published data on disease interactions. Difficulties in distinguishing different types of interaction, mainly different types of competition are emphasized. In a specific study, the thesis considers the <b>barley</b> <b>diseases</b> scald (caused by Rhynchosporium secalis) and net blotch (caused by Drechslera teres). 	Aiming to understand how diseases interact in the field, it is further concluded that increased focus {{should be placed on}} considering the dynamics of the plant growth along with the epidemiological development. This is pointed out by observations of antagonism between scald and net blotch on individual leaves and further via a simulation model. The model shows that differences in pathogen dispersal rates between vertical leaf layers of the plant and the overlap of leaf layers over time are important for competitive outcome from two fungal competitors. 	Detailed disease observations on individual leaves provide insight into understanding interplay between disease severity and plant senescence. This level of detail does not, though, give a better description of yield loss from disease, relative to the generally used plot assessment, where disease severities are determined as averages over the crop. 	 	The work presented in the PhD thesis is relevant for all who work with foliar pathogens. Optimal disease control and plant breeding is based on knowledge of factors determining epidemic development and hence interactions between simultaneously developing pathogens must be considered...|$|R
40|$|In two Spanish barley landraces with {{outstanding}} {{resistance to}} scald, the Rrs 1 Rh 4 locus was fine mapped including all known markers used {{in previous studies}} and closely linked markers were developed. Scald, caused by Rhynchosporium commune, {{is one of the}} most prevalent <b>barley</b> <b>diseases</b> worldwide. A search for new resistance sources revealed that Spanish landrace-derived lines SBCC 145 and SBCC 154 showed outstanding resistance to scald. They were crossed to susceptible cultivar Beatrix to create large DH-mapping populations of 522 and 416 DH lines that were scored for disease resistance in the greenhouse using two R. commune isolates. To ascertain the pattern of resistance, parents and reference barley lines with known scald resistance were phenotyped with a panel of differential R. commune isolates. Subpopulations were genotyped with the Illumina GoldenGate 1, 536 SNP Assay and a large QTL in the centromeric region of chromosome 3 H, known to harbour several scald resistance genes and/or alleles, was found in both populations. Five SNP markers closest to the QTL were converted into CAPS markers. These CAPS markers, together with informative SSR markers used in other scald studies, confirmed the presence of the Rrs 1 locus. The panel of differential scald isolates indicated that the allele carried by both donors was Rrs 1 Rh 4. The genetic distance between Rrs 1 and its flanking markers was 1. 2  cM (11 _ 0010) proximally and 0. 9  cM (11 _ 0823) distally, which corresponds to a distance of just below 9  Mbp. The number and nature of scald resistance genes on chromosome 3 H are discussed. The effective Rrs 1 allele found and the closely linked markers developed are already useful tools for molecular breeding programs and provide a good step towards the identification of candidate genes.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{constraints}} to successful barley production results from foliar diseases, which destroy green leaf area and thus restrict the barley plant’s ability to set yield and fill grain. Although a range of strategies are available to control foliar and other cereal diseases, rarely does {{the use of a}} single “silver bullet ” solution provide complete protection. The main <b>barley</b> foliar <b>diseases</b> in western Canada are scald, (Rhynchosporium secalis), netted (Drechslera teres (Sacc.) Shoemaker) and spotted (Drechslera teres f. maculata Smedeg.) forms of net blotch, and spot blotch (Cochliobolus sativus (Ito & Kuribayashi) Drechs. ex Dastur). Scald, net blotch and spot blotch each have unique life cycles, and as a consequence producers need to consider a combination of strategies to provide effective and consistent long-term protection from these foliar diseases. This paper provides an overview of the holistic management of common foliar <b>diseases</b> of <b>barley</b> in western Canada, using a diverse set of management tools, and applying a growing season perspective...|$|R
40|$|Australian barley {{crops are}} {{affected}} by a range of leaf and root diseases. Diseases constitute a significant limitation to sustainable barley production. Reducing impacts from diseases is important for reliable production of high quality <b>barley.</b> Some <b>diseases</b> are prevalent around Australia whereas others are of regional significance (Table 1). The lack of resistance in major varieties grown in Australia to diseases like scald, net blotches, leaf rust and powdery mildew (Table 2) can impact on yield and grain quality mainly through a reduction in grain size. Reduced grain yields and low malting quality reduce returns to growers and affect domestic and export marketability. Improvements are sought {{through the development of}} varieties with adequate levels of resistance to the range of important biotic stresses. A major objective in barley breeding programs around Australia is to develop varieties with improved combinations of disease resistances while maintaining or improving yield, quality and other agronomic traits.

40|$|Fusarium {{head blight}} (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum is a devastating disease {{that results in}} {{extensive}} yield losses to wheat and barley. A green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing plasmid pRP 22 -GFP was constructed for monitoring the colonization of two biocontrol agents, Brevibacillus brevis ZJY- 1 and Bacillus subtilis ZJY- 116, on the spikes of barley and their effect on suppression of FHB. Survival and colonization of the Brevibacillus brevis ZJY- 1 and Bacillus subtilis ZJY- 116 strains on spikes of barley were observed by tracking the bacterial transformants with GFP expression. Our field study revealed that plasmid pRP 22 -GFP was stably maintained in the bacterial strains without selective pressure. The retrieved GFP-tagged strains showed that the bacterial population fluctuation accorded {{with that of the}} rain events. Furthermore, both biocontrol strains gave significant protection against FHB on spikes of barley in fields.

All the culms of a single stool are affected, and the diseased plants die prematurely. When the spots of the fungus begin to appear the plant ceases to grow and very little barley is produced. This species was referred to Helminthosporium gramineum {{because it seems to}} agree with the fungus described by Rabenhorst.

In this study the level of fungicide sensitivity of current WA Bgh isolates was assessed by examining colony inhibition in the presence of both registered and novel fungicides. One strain with reduced sensitivity was genotypically characterized in the target site for triazole fungicides, the Cyp 5 I gene, and was found to harbor a mutation common in triazole resistant Bgh isolates. This is the first confirmed case of fungicide resistance in Australia...|$|R
