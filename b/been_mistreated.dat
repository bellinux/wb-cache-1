5|$|The {{negative}} press {{did not end}} however, as Nye and Pond {{threatened to}} sue Riley for causing their tour to end prematurely. They claimed to have lost $20,000. Walker threatened a separate suit demanding $1,000. Riley hired Indianapolis lawyer William P. Fishback to represent him and the men settled out of court. The full details of the settlement were never disclosed, but whatever the case, Riley finally extricated himself from his old contracts and became a free agent. The exorbitant amount Riley was being sued for only reinforced public opinion that Riley had <b>been</b> <b>mistreated</b> by his partners, and helped him maintain his image. Nye and Riley remained good friends, and Riley later wrote that Pond and Walker were {{the source of the}} problems.|$|E
5|$|In November 1994, Walford {{resident}} Robbie Jackson (Dean Gaffney) {{takes in}} a dog he assumes to be a stray, naming him Wellard. The dog's owner, Mr Hammond, locates him and demands him back, but Wellard later returns to Albert Square {{of his own}} accord. Robbie realises he has <b>been</b> <b>mistreated</b> and has run away. Mr Hammond admits to neglecting Wellard, and allows Robbie to keep him. Wellard fathers puppies with Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp); however, the puppies are stillborn. When Robbie begins {{a relationship with a}} woman allergic to dogs, she gives him the ultimatum of choosing between her and Wellard: Robbie chooses Wellard. Several years later, when Robbie is due to leave Walford to live in India, Wellard is run over, delaying Robbie's departure. He is cared for by Robbie's sister Sonia (Natalie Cassidy), who gives him to her friend Gus (Mohammed George) after Robbie's departure. When Gus is involved in a minibus crash, Wellard is able to save his owner by leading him to a spot from where he can call the emergency services.|$|E
25|$|Newman {{argued that}} he had <b>been</b> <b>mistreated</b> by the patent office, and tried to have his motor legalized {{directly}} by the US Congress. He obtained a hearing on 30 July 1986 in front of several senators, but he was unsuccessful. During the hearing, Newman refused to have the machine tested by independent experts, and senator John Glenn pointed out that his supposedly-independent expert actually had a prior business relationship with him.|$|E

Some people also abstain from milk and its derivatives for ethical reasons, because the production of veal is a byproduct of the dairy industry. The ethical issues with intensive agriculture {{have to do with}} the concentration of animals, animal waste, and the potential for dead animals in a small space.|$|E
25|$|At this point, one of Alexios' commanders, Alakaseus, decided upon a ruse: he shaved and {{disfigured}} himself, {{and went}} to meet the pretender, claiming to have <b>been</b> <b>mistreated</b> by Alexios. Calling upon his old friendship Romanos IV and his sufferings to prove his loyalty, he induced the pretender to enter the fortress of Poutza, which he proposed to surrender to him. The pretender and his Cuman escorts were feted and dined at the governor's palace. After they fell asleep, however, the Byzantines killed the Cumans and took the pretender captive. At Tzouroulos, he was delivered to the droungarios Eustathios Kymineianos, and blinded by a Turkish servant. Following the capture of the pretender, Alexios defeated the Cumans and drove them back across the Danube.|$|E
25|$|BBC Three {{described}} Torchwood as the centrepiece of its autumn 2006 schedule, and {{the successful}} first series {{led to a}} second series on BBC Two and a third on BBC One in 2009. However, Davies {{expressed concern that the}} third series was aired in a summer evening graveyard slot. Lead actor John Barrowman felt that the show had <b>been</b> <b>mistreated</b> by BBC executives, despite what he felt was the programme's proven popularity and success. The third series, entitled Children of Earth, began shooting on 18 August 2008, and comprised a five-episode mini-series that aired over five consecutive days at 9pm on BBC One from 6 July 2009, and 9pm on BBC America HD and BBC America from 20 July 2009. Davies and Gardner stayed on as executive producers, and Peter Bennett produced the series.|$|E

25|$|On 27 July, the SPLM-IO {{captured}} the Ngo Baggari County in Wau State {{from the government}} after fierce clashes, with the rebels claiming that they had {{captured the}} local County Commissioner, Anthony Fada Taban. There were also speculations that Taban might have defected to the SPLM-IO. Governor Mayan admitted that the SPLA had indeed abandoned Ngo Baggari County to the SPLM-IO, but said that the retreat was voluntary and that no clashes had taken place. Furthermore, he denied that the County Commissioner had been captured. The SPLM-IO's success in Ngo Baggari was {{explained by the fact}} that many locals, who were former soldiers, had <b>been</b> <b>mistreated</b> by the government and subsequently joined the rebels. SPLM-IO commander Ashab Khamis Fahal claimed that 1725 SPLA soldiers had defected to them. Meanwhile, a representative of the UDSF-M party accused SPLA units in Wau State of ignoring the ceasefire and attacking the local opposition groups, thereby causing the insecurity and chaos in the state. He also said that, as the SPLA soldiers received their orders only from the government in Juba, the governor was sidelined and in consequence unable to control the military.|$|E

500|$|Relations between CreangÄƒ and Grigoriu were {{exceptionally}} tense. Only {{weeks after}} his wedding, the groom, who had probably agreed to marriage only because it could facilitate succeeding Grigoriu, signed a complaint addressed to Metropolitan Sofronie Miclescu, denouncing his father in law as [...] "a killer", claiming to have <b>been</b> <b>mistreated</b> by him and cheated out of his wife's dowry, and demanding to be allowed a divorce. The response to this request was contrary to his wishes: he was ordered into isolation by the Dicasterie, the supreme ecclesiastical court, being allowed to go free only on promise to reconcile with Grigoriu.|$|E

As a yearling, Tristan was bought by the French owner C. J. Lefevre, who sent the colt to be trained by Tom Jennings at the Phantom House stable at Newmarket, Suffolk. Jennings would later say that Tristan had <b>been</b> <b>mistreated</b> as a yearling before his arrival at Newmarket and this explained his well-known temperament problems. Tristan was ridden in most of his races by George Fordham and came to show a strong and sometimes violent dislike for other jockeys.|$|E
500|$|Producer Harve Bennett was {{exhausted}} by {{his work on}} the previous three Star Trek films and wanted to move on, feeling that he {{was not part of the}} Star Trek [...] "family" [...] and that he had <b>been</b> <b>mistreated</b> by Nimoy. When Shatner tried to convince Bennett to reconsider, the producer insisted on a meeting at his home. After several hours of discussion Bennett agreed to return. Bennett disagreed with several elements of Shatner's story, feeling that because no one could assuredly answer the question of God's existence, the ending of the film would never be satisfying. Bennett also told Shatner that the film had the feeling of a tone poem rather than an adventure story. The studio agreed with Bennett, reasoning that the subject matter could be too weighty or offensive to theatergoers.|$|E

A witness said he had overheard the screams and beatings of Matar on 10 May while he was being held for interrogation at a military barrack in Riffa.

500|$|In his {{maiden speech}} to Parliament in July 1987, Livingstone used {{parliamentary}} privilege {{to raise a}} number of allegations made by Fred Holroyd, a former Special Intelligence Service operative in Northern Ireland. Despite the convention of maiden speeches being non-controversial, Livingstone alleged that Holroyd had <b>been</b> <b>mistreated</b> {{when he tried to}} expose MI5 collusion with Ulster loyalist paramilitaries in the 1970s. Thatcher denounced his claims as [...] "utterly contemptible". In September 1987 Livingstone was elected to Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC), although was voted off in October 1989, to be replaced by John Prescott. As Kinnock tried to pull Labour to the centre, Livingstone worked to strengthen socialist elements in the party. He continued to make his opinions known, refusing to pay the controversial poll tax until it was revoked, and being one of the 55 Labour MPs to oppose British involvement in the Gulf War in January 1991. Conversely, he supported NATO intervention in the Balkans, and the bombing of Serbia.|$|E
500|$|Lim {{expressed}} concerns about a proposed constitutional amendment introduced in April 2010 {{that would allow}} magistrates to hear what are called [...] "first mentions" [...] through video conferencing. A first mention is a hearing that must be held within 48 hours of a person's arrest. She felt it failed to adequately assure accused people that {{they were allowed to}} complain to magistrates about injuries they had sustained or acts of misfeasance against them by the authorities. In response, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng assured MPs that processes would be in place to ensure that accused people are treated fairly. For example, during a video conference, an accused person will be alone in a room with no police officer, and {{will be able to see}} what is happening in the entire courtroom. Secondly, the screen that will be used by the judge is large enough to enable him or her to clearly see whether the accused is under duress. Finally, accused people who have <b>been</b> <b>mistreated</b> can either complain to the police or to the judge when they are later present in court.|$|E
500|$|For the Viet Cong commandos of the 65th Special Operations Group, the {{explosion}} on Card signalled a successful mission. By {{the time the}} sun rose over Saigon, Card had sunk [...] into the river with its engine compartment completely flooded. Furthermore, five American civilians {{who worked on the}} ship {{died as a result of}} the attack. Due to the rapid response from the shipâ€™s crew and the local authorities, flooding inside the ship was quickly stopped and it was stabilized. An inspection later revealed that {{the explosion}} had torn open a hole which measured [...] long and [...] high, on the starboard side of the ship. In the days that followed, five U.S. Navy divers were deployed to Saigon from the Philippines, in addition to several salvage teams from U.S. bases in Japan and the Military Sea Transport Service Command. Amongst the divers was founding US Navy Seals member Roy Boehm, who claimed to have recovered the remains of a Hagerson Demolition Pack, a specialised explosive charge used by US navy frogmen. Bohem speculated that the explosives used in the attack had actually been stolen from his own South Vietnamese Navy unit by a group of deserters who had <b>been</b> <b>mistreated</b> by a South Vietnamese officer.|$|E

She later begins a choreographed routine with her girlfriends, who appear to also have <b>been</b> <b>mistreated</b> by their men. The women then march down Auburn Avenue before they head home to throw their men's clothes off the balcony. The video received mixed to positive reviews. Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy was positive and called it a [...] "beautifully shot portrait of a woman {{on the edge of a}} nervous breakdown", and The Fader writer Julianne Escobedo Shepherd regarded it as an accurate representation of how women act when they are [...] "wronged by dudes".
