The momentary push-button switch {{is a type}} of <b>biased</b> <b>switch.</b> The most common type is a [...] "push-to-make" [...] (or normally-open or NO) switch, which makes contact when the button is pressed and breaks when the button is released. Each key of a computer keyboard, for example, is a normally-open [...] "push-to-make" [...] switch. A [...] "push-to-break" [...] (or normally-closed or NC) switch, on the other hand, breaks contact when the button is pressed and makes contact when it is released. An example of a push-to-break switch is a button used to release a door held closed by an electromagnet. The interior lamp of a household refrigerator is controlled by a switch that is held open when the door is closed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — An efficiency-enhanced power-amplifier system using dynamic <b>bias</b> <b>switching</b> {{method is}} {{presented}}. The presented system generates two different voltage sources from one source for drain bias of a RF power amplifier. The drain of the RF power amplifier is biased at low voltage level while the input RF signal is detected to be small. The drain bias is rapidly changed to high voltage level when the input RF signal reaches a certain threshold level. The measured drain bias at VH state is 4. 6 V with {{the efficiency of}} the <b>bias</b> <b>switching</b> system, 49 % and at VL is 2. 94 V with 86 %. The measured result shows that the overall efficiency of the proposed RF power amplifier is improved by 62 % compared to that of the fixed bias amplifier, when OFDM signal with bandwidth 8. 46 MHz is applied.

40|$|New indices, {{calculated}} on {{data from}} the widely used Dot Probe Task, were recently proposed to capture variability in biased attention allocation. We observed that it remains unclear which data pattern {{is meant to be}} indicative of dynamic bias and thus to be captured by these indices. Moreover, we hypothesized that the new indices are sensitive to SD differences at the response time (RT) level in the absence of bias. Randomly generated datasets were analyzed to assess properties of the Attention Bias Variability (ABV) and Trial Level Bias Score (TL-BS) indices. Sensitivity to creating differences in 1) RT standard deviation, 2) mean RT, and 3) bias magnitude were assessed. In addition, two possible definitions of dynamic attention bias were explored by creating differences in 4) frequency of <b>bias</b> <b>switching,</b> and 5) <b>bias</b> magnitude in the presence of constant switching. ABV and TL-BS indices were found highly sensitive to increasing SD at the response time level, insensitive to increasing bias, linearly sensitive to increasing bias magnitude in the presence of <b>bias</b> <b>switches,</b> and non-linearly sensitive to increasing the frequency of <b>bias</b> <b>switches.</b> The ABV index was also found responsive to increasing mean response times in the absence of bias. Recently proposed DPT derived variability indices cannot uncouple measurement error from bias variability. Significant group differences may be observed even if there is no bias present in any individual dataset. This renders the new indices in their current form unfit for empirical purposes. Our discussion focuses on fostering debate and ideas for new research to validate the potentially very important notion of biased attention being dynamic...|$|R

40|$|Thallium bromide (TlBr) is {{a highly}} {{efficient}} ionic semiconductor with excellent radiation detection properties. However, at room temperature, TlBr devices polarize under an applied electric field. This phenomenon not only degrades the charge collection efficiency of the detectors but also promotes chemical reaction of the metal electrodes with bromine, resulting in an unstable electric field and premature failure of the device. This drawback has been crippling the TlBr semiconductor radiation detector technology {{over the past few}} decades. In this exhaustive study, this polarization phenomenon has been counteracted using innovative <b>bias</b> polarity <b>switching</b> schemes. Here the highly mobile Br− species, with an estimated electro-diffusion velocity of 10 − 8 cm/s, face opposing electro-migration forces during every polarity switch. This minimizes the device polarization and availability of Br− ions near the metal electrode. Our results indicate {{that it is possible to}} achieve longer device lifetimes spanning more than 17 000 h (five years of 8 × 7 operation) for planar and pixelated radiation detectors using this technique. On the other hand, at constant bias, 2500 h is the longest reported lifetime with most devices less than 1000 h. After testing several <b>biasing</b> <b>switching</b> schemes, it is concluded that the critical <b>bias</b> <b>switching</b> frequency at an applied bias of 1000 V/cm is about 17 μHz.

Depending on current <b>bias,</b> <b>switching</b> can occur between either two static magnetic states or a static {{state and a}} current-driven precessional mode. In both cases, the switching is thermally activated and governed by the sample temperature, not a higher effective magnetic temperature.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{electric}} poling on the bipolar switching for tetragonal BZT-BCT materials is studied using large signal polarization and strain, small signal permittivity, and piezoelectric coefficient, {{as well as}} electric field-dependent in situ XRD experiments. Charge carrier agglomeration at domain and grain boundaries with increasing poling fields gives rise to an internal bias field that gradually <b>biases</b> domain <b>switching</b> behavior. The <b>biased</b> <b>switching</b> after electric poling is quantified during a bipolar measurement cycle from analysis of the electric and structural data. For a fresh sample the ferroelastic domain texture induced by a positive and negative electric measurement field is of the same magnitude. After poling, the induced ferroelastic domain texture is larger under a positive measurement field and smaller under a negative measurement field. A very large domain texture is achieved during poling, corresponding to 85 % of the domains becoming aligned with their 002 pole in field direction. While the domain texture is significantly improved at higher poling fields, relaxation upon removal of the electric field appears independent of the poling history. This suggests a large extrinsic contribution to the macroscopic strain. It also facilitates the <b>biased</b> ferroelastic <b>switching</b> arising from the internal bias field developed during poling. © 2013 The American Ceramic Society...|$|R

The residual excitation is suppressed by complementing a predetermined fast bias change with a linear ramp whose time-dependent slope compensates for the displacement of the wells. The process, combined with vibrational multiplexing and demultiplexing, can produce vibrational state inversion without exciting internal states, just by deforming the trap.

The low-frequency noise decreases, if the transistors are switched "off" periodically (<b>switched</b> <b>biased</b> conditions). In this work, we have studied both p-MOS and n-MOS devices. The small devices (W/L= 10 : 0. 3) have a few trapping states, which is proven by the Lorentzian nature of the power spectrum.
