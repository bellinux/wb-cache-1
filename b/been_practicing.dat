An investigation cleared the F-20 of mechanical or design faults; it concluded Cornell had blacked out due to excessive g-forces. GI1001 crashed in May 1985 at Goose Bay, Labrador, killing Northrop pilot Dave Barnes. Again the crash was blamed on G-LOC; Barnes had <b>been</b> <b>practicing</b> his aerobatic routine for the Paris Air Show.|$|E

5|$|When Smith {{moved to}} Kirtland, Ohio in January 1831, he {{encountered}} a religious culture that included enthusiastic demonstrations of spiritual gifts, including fits and trances, rolling on the ground, and speaking in tongues.

Smith had promised church elders that in Kirtland they would receive an endowment of heavenly power, and at the June 1831 general conference, he introduced the greater authority of a High ("Melchizedek") Priesthood to the church hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|Although Phra Candasaro {{had studied}} with many masters, and had {{mastered}} many important Pali texts, {{he was not}} satisfied. He withdrew himself in the more peaceful area of his hometown twice. Some sources state he also withdrew himself in the jungles to meditate more, but Newell doubts this. In the eleventh rains retreat (vassa) after his ordination, in 1916, he stayed at Wat Botbon at Bangkuvieng, Nonthaburi Province. Wat Botbon was the temple {{where he used to}} receive education as a child, a temple known for its peacefulness. As seen from Luang Pu Sodh's autobiographical notes, he reflected to himself that he had <b>been</b> <b>practicing</b> meditation for many years and had still not understood the essential knowledge which the Buddha had taught. Thus, on the full-moon day in the tenth lunar month of 1916, he sat down in the main shrine hall of Wat Botbon, resolving not to waver in his practice of sitting meditation, whatever might disturb his single-mindedness. That same night he experienced in meditation {{what became known as the}} attainment of the Dhammakaya, which marked the start of Dhammakaya meditation as a tradition.|$|E

The film tells the story of McTeague, a San Francisco dentist, who marries his best friend Schouler's girlfriend Trina. Shortly after their engagement, Trina wins a lottery prize of $5,000, at that time a substantial sum. Schouler jealously informs the authorities that McTeague had <b>been</b> <b>practicing</b> dentistry without a license, and McTeague and Trina become impoverished. While living in squalor, McTeague becomes a violent alcoholic and Trina becomes greedily obsessed with her winnings, refusing to spend any of them, despite how poor she and her husband have become. Eventually McTeague murders Trina for the money and flees to Death Valley. Schouler catches up with him there for a final confrontation.|$|E
