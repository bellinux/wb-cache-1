50|$|Many of The Seattle Public Library's {{facilities}} are notable works of architecture. They reflect {{the aesthetics of}} several very different periods. The various former Carnegie libraries and the Douglass-Truth library all date from a single period of two decades in the early 20th century. No further branch libraries were built between 1921 and 1954, and when <b>branch</b> <b>construction</b> resumed, the International style had swept away the earlier revivalism. Today's Greenwood and North East branches are both expanded versions of 1954 libraries, the latter originally designed by Paul Thiry; a third library from 1954, the Susan J. Henry branch on Capitol Hill, has been entirely replaced, as has Bindon & Wright's 1960 Central Library.|$|E

5000|$|George Hudson {{had been}} {{supportive}} of the North British in the early months, but now he sponsored reports in the press criticising its engineering quality. There was talk of a new railway from Berwick to Edinburgh via Kelso, cutting out the NBR altogether. The object of this propaganda was clear when Hudson offered to lease the NBR, obviously his objective all along. His terms were to pay 8% on its capital on the main line and 5% on the branches (only Haddington and Hawick—other <b>branch</b> <b>construction</b> was to be deferred) with an option to amalgamate with his York and Newcastle Railway and Newcastle and Berwick Railway. 8% was not a bad offer: [...] "Strange to say, these remarkably liberal terms were rejected by {{the directors of the}} North British Company", but John Learmonth had other ambitions for his North British Railway. Scottish pride may also have been a factor in rejecting Hudson's advances.|$|E

50|$|At {{the time}} of the <b>branch's</b> <b>construction</b> Goole was served by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR), Selby by the North Eastern Railway, and Drax by the Hull and Barnsley Railway. However a {{bottleneck}} at the two-track Selby swing bridge on the already busy East Coast Main Line from London to Scotland meant that freight trains were often delayed, the building of the line was therefore desirable since it offered another path to the port of Hull via Goole for the coal and other freight that was exported via the port at that time.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{load-bearing}} part of {{a chimney}} pipe is a reinforced concrete shell of revolution. Its design model is a free-standing bar of the circular cross-section. It is recommended to conduct the analysis of cross-section guided by the <b>branch</b> <b>construction</b> norms VSN 286 - 90 [1]. This document was developed for “hand” calculations. Therefore, it contains simplifications which can be avoided. A method based on stricter presuppositions is suggested. Its basis is deformation plasticity theory. Concrete and steel are considered as nonlinear materials. The problem is reduced to a sequence of nonlinear equations which are solved by the method of variable parameters of stiffness. The approach does not require to predetermine a diagram of a limit state of the section, as it is formed {{in the process of}} solution. The criteria of a load-bearing capacity of the section are concrete and steel strains. Their maximum values are specified by construction norms...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the Ginzburg-Landau energy for a type-I superconductor {{in the shape}} of an infinite three-dimensional slab, with two-dimensional periodicity, with an applied magnetic field which is uniform and perpendicular to the slab. We determine the optimal scaling law of the minimal energy in terms of the parameters of the problem, when the applied magnetic field is sufficiently small and the sample sufficiently thick. This optimal scaling law is proven via ansatz-free lower bounds and an explicit <b>branching</b> <b>construction</b> which refines further and further as one approaches the surface of the sample. Two different regimes appear, with different scaling exponents. In the first regime, the branching leads to an almost uniform magnetic field pattern on the boundary; in the second one the inhomogeneity survives up to the boundary.
