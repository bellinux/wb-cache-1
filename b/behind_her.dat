The two pools of light <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> have been described as lending the painting a mystical atmosphere, indicating the presence of God. In the niche <b>behind</b> <b>her,</b> the statues are lit by two candles - symbols of the incarnation, whereas she is bathed in natural light. The artificial light adds to the overall illusion of the interior of the church, which Pächt views as achieved mainly through colour.|$|E
