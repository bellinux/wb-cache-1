50|$|According to archaeological {{findings}} of pottery and other {{debris from the}} two islands, it is concluded that they were occupied between 600 and 1500 AD. In the later part of the 18th century, cotton planters and their slaves lived here. Census records of 1858 show that 27 people lived {{on the island and}} were engaged in farming of crops and vegetables such as cassava, sweet potatoes, yams, corn, peas, pumpkins, and watermelons. They also raised cattle and ran fishing operations. In 1947, the islands were abandoned. The last inhabitant to leave the island was the lighthouse keeper who left in 1974. It was only in 1994 that the Conservatoire du Littoral made the two islets central to their activity and later decreed the <b>Biotope</b> <b>Protection</b> Order as a reserve. Since 2002, the operation and maintenance of the reserve {{has been part of the}} activities of the Association désiradienne Ti Te.|$|E

Sie sind im temperaten Klima Mitteleuropas auf trockenwarme Sonderstandorte beschränkt, und ihre Pflanzengesellschaften setzen sich aus adaptierten, meist xerophytischen Pflanzenarten submediterran-mediterraner oder pontisch-sarmatischer Herkunft zusammen. Dem entspricht die pflanzensoziologische Unterscheidung der kontinentalen Festucetalia valesiacae- und der submediterranen Brometalia erecti-Trockenrasen und ihrer typischen Vegetationskomplexe. Es sind allesamt Relikte aus der postglazialen Vegetations- und Landschaftsentwicklung in Mitteleuropa. Ihre geographische Verbreitung und die besondere Stellung für den Arten- und Biotopschutz werden vergleichend erläutert. The {{xerothermic}} plant {{communities of}} Central Europe show {{as a rule}} a mosaic of rocks, dry grassland, thermophilic edge- and mantle - communities and areas of oak shrub forests. They are limited in the temperate climate of Central Europe to dry warm special habitats and their plant communities are composed of adapted mostly xerophytical plant species of submediter­ranean, mediterranean or pontic-sarmatical origin. This corresponds with the plantsociological distinction of the continental Festucetalia valesiacae and the submediterranean Brometalia erecti dry grassland and its typical vegetation-groups. They are all relicts of the postglacial ve­getation- and landscape development in Central Europe. Their geographical distribution and the special situation for the species and <b>biotope</b> <b>protection</b> are comparatively explained...|$|E
40|$|Progress {{in urban}} ecology {{in the last}} 30 years has shown that also many plants and animals live in urban agglomerations and are adapted to the {{specific}} ecological conditions in urban areas. Nature conservation in cities focuses on <b>protection</b> of their <b>biotopes</b> (habitats) {{as a basis for}} a direct contact between urban dwellers and the natural elements of their surroundings, and in order to preserve biodiversity as well as to mitigate the extremes of urban climates and water regimes. Fifteen years ago, investigations started in Germany in order to inventory the habitats of flora and fauna which are important for nature conservation in cities. The investigations, which became famous as "biotope mapping", focused mainly on floristic and phytosociological features. Additionally, some animal groups were selected. In principle, two methods of biotopes mapping can be distinguished : 1) Selective mapping investigates only <b>biotopes</b> worthy of <b>protection.</b> 2) Comprehensive mapping raises biological data representative of all land-use types and biotopes. The advantage of comprehensive mapping in that it provides a broader basis for later utilization of the results. The disadvantage is that it requires a great deal of money, time and staff. Therefore, in most German cities, until now selective mapping was employed. For the city Augsburf, where both methods were used biotope maps are shown. Their application in nature conservation and city planning are explained. In contrast to most European countries, where meanwhile biotope mapping is an important basis for nature conservation, similar standardized investigations so far do not exist in Japan. Therefore, in the urban agglomeration of Tokyo-Yokohama, a pilot study was started in the summer of 1996 in order to test this method in Japan...|$|R
40|$|Biotope mapping {{involves}} {{an investigation of}} flora, vegetation, fauna and their habitats {{within the context of}} nature conservation. Biotope mapping is done in many European cities. The results are an important basis for nature conservation and infrastructure planning. In contrast, similar standardized investigations so far do not exist in Japan. Therefore, in the urban agglomeration of Tokyo [...] Yokohama, a pilot study was started in the summer of 1996 in order to test this method in Japan. Two test areas were selected : area 1 around the campus of the Yokohama National University and area 2 around Minato Mirai. These areas were selected for two reasons: 1) actual data of flora and vegetation already exist for the university campus; 2) the areas include many different land-use types, which are typical for the agglomeration of Tokyo. For the investigation,a modification of the representative mapping method was used. After the investigation of the land-use types and after checking the biologically rich areas, an evaluation was done. In this way, areas worthy of protection were selected and described in more detail by standardized forms. The high number of <b>biotopes</b> worthy of <b>protection</b> in test area 2 is remarkable, when one compares the two test areas. By reasons are the hilly morphology and the development of settlements in recent times, areas with a steeper slope especially remained for spontaneous nature, mainly secondary forests as the dominant biotope type, followed by grass-dominated has been settled for a long time, only a few areas remained for nature. Dominant biotope types worthy or protection are mainly parks and herbaceous ruderal vegetation. The pilot study show the, by using this method, many information can be collected in a relatively short time, which is important for nature conservation in the city. Each biotope type is very important for ecosystems, but, a hierarchy for evaluation of biotope types is needed, because the Japanese land area is narrow and limited. Which kind of biotopes are more important and which should have priority for protection. These kind of studies should be continued...|$|R
40|$|A unique karst {{formation}} made of gypsum overlaying the Zechsteinoutcrops {{formed at}} the southern side of Harz including the Kyffhaeuser. The completely wealth of typical karst formations, the soil associations coming from and the forms of vegetation and fauna specific because of the climatic and other special site factors, these all justify the outstanding worth of nature protection of this man-made landscape. Specially by the strip mining of gypsom and anhydrit but also by measures of infrastructure, settlement development, agriculture and other environmental impacts the worth of this unique landscape is endangered. In the attempt to solve this problems, efforts are made by Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Lower Saxony to strive for the nomination of a biosphere reserve crossing their borders. The presented study provides the principles to decide on continuing sustainable use of this region. Basing {{on the results of}} a workshop first the historico-cultural landscape development, the situation of the natural units (specially the karst morphology and karst hydrology, soil and soil protection, the facts of biotopes and <b>biotope</b> and species <b>protection)</b> and the facts of uses were analyzed. The areas of conflict were determined included their most characteristic conflicts. The discussion of objectives - against the background of ecopolitical demands for sustainable landuse and development - put the idea of sustainability in concrete terms (guideline and environmental quality objectives) for the regional conception. Different instruments to reach the main project aim were evaluated: instruments of land and nature conservation, especially the establishment of a biosphere reserve, the possibilities of federal soil protection act (draft version), further the integration in existing planning systems, the use of special promotion programs and the following on from regional activities. After that the fields of decision were worked out and an expert recommendation was given for the sustainable development combined with the question of biosphere reserve in southern Harz. The establishment of a biosphere reserve 'Suedharz' is recommended, a proposal of a zonation pattern is made and measures for the sustainable development are demonstrated. (orig.)
