50|$|Cold liquor {{tanks are}} used for brewing process and CLTâ€™s also called buffer tanks. Buffer tanks contain cold water used {{for the purpose of}} cooling the <b>bitter</b> <b>wort</b> {{temperature}} down to the fermentable level range after boiling. This process is done by wort cooler.|$|E
50|$|Bitterness scales {{attempt to}} rate the {{perceived}} relative bitterness of beer. The bitterness of beer is provided by compounds such as humulones, or alpha acids from hops used during brewing. During the brewing process, humulone undergoes isomerization to form both cis- and trans- isohumulone which {{are responsible for the}} bitter taste of the beer. Likewise, hops contain lupulones, or beta acids. These beta acids are not considered in the initial <b>bittering</b> of the <b>wort</b> as much as their alpha acid counterparts since they do not isomerize through boiling, and therefore do not dissolve in the wort. However, beta acids can undergo oxidation and slowly contribute to the bitterness of the beer. This bitterness is harsher than the bitterness of the alpha acids and this flavor can be undesirable. The oxidation occurs over time through fermentation, storage, and aging. At the same time, isomerized alpha acids undergo degradation and reduce the bitterness of the beer.|$|R
