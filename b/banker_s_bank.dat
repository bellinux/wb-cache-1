40|$|Using U. <b>S.</b> {{cross-border}} <b>bank</b> exposure data, {{this study}} establishes {{a line of}} arguments and findings, which together constitute the following observation: "Deregulation of U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks,</b> via consolidation and a volatile earnings stream, increased volatility in bank lending to emerging economies, and, in due course, worsened the financial crises in emerging economies. " The volatility of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> lending to emerging economies has increased during the past twenty years. To explain the across-the-board, increasing volatility of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> emerging market claims, this study turns to the supply side of the equation: the deregulation in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> sector that imparted this commonality to their banks' investment patterns to emerging economies. In so doing, it unveils the linkages through which U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> deregulation ratcheted up the volatility of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> lending into emerging economies. It starts with the detection of a particular feature of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> emerging market lending that warrants further attention [...] increasing volatility over time. Unlike bank lending from Europe or Japan, U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> lending exhibited the unique feature of increasing volatility over time, regardless of its destination. By looking into domestic push factors that could have contributed to this characteristic, this study identified a temporal association between important deregulation initiatives in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> industry and the volatility of emerging market lending by U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> during the same period. This association was then explained by the linkages between the major outcomes of deregulation [...] consolidation of the banking industry and diversification of banking activities [...] and the increased volatility of lending into emerging economies. Together, it argues that the U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> deregulation had the unintended and unanticipated side effect of increasing the volatility of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> lending into emerging economies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{documents}} the changing international exposures of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> balance sheets since the mid- 1980 <b>s.</b> U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> have foreign positions heavily concentrated in Europe, with more volatile flows to {{other regions of}} the world. In recent years some cross-border claims on Latin American countries have declined, while claims extended locally by the branches and subsidiaries of U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> have grown. The foreign exposures of larger U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> tend to be less volatile than claims of smaller banks, and locally-issued claims tend to be more stable than cross-border flows. Business cycle variables have mixed influence on U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> cross-border and local claims. The cross-border claims of U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> on European customers tend to be procyclical. By contrast, locally generated and cross border claims on Latin American customers of U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> are not robustly related to either U. S. or country-specific business cycle variables. U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> {{do not appear to be}} strong conduits for transmitting U. S. cycles to these smaller markets, and may instead serve a positive role in stabilizing the amplitude of foreign country cycles. ...|$|R
40|$|Non-U. S. firms {{frequently}} pay {{a substantial}} premium {{to have a}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> lead their initial public offering of equity, even when the issuing firm is not seeking a listing on a U. S. exchange. We provide evidence that this decision reflects an expectation that U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> deliver a higher quality bundle of underwriting services. Specifically, a non-U. S. issuing firm that includes a U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> in its underwriting syndicate can expect to have its offering underpriced by 17. 7 percentage points less than had it not included a U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> in the syndicate. Failure {{to account for the}} endogeneity of the decision to hire a U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> vastly understates the magnitude of the effect. This finding has direct implications for the claim that U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> spreads for domestic IPOs are above competitive levels. ...|$|R

Using U. <b>S.</b> cross-border <b>bank</b> exposure data, this study identifies a temporal association between important deregulation initiatives and the volatility of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> emerging market lending.

40|$|Global {{financial}} markets have experienced significant volatility in recent years, including financial crises in Asia in 1997 and in Russia in 1998. Emerging-market countries, in particular, {{were subject to}} sharp downward market moves. U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> supervisors monitored these events carefully to determine the potential effect on U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> organizations and paid particular attention to U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> claims on emerging-market counterparties. Monitoring claims on emerging-market counterparties allows supervisors to identify any developing concentrations of risk that might warrant supervisory action and, if necessary, to assess the effect that a potential emerging-market crisis might have on U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks.</b> This article focuses on the claims U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> held on emerging-market counterparties during the two-year period from June 1997 to June 1999 and discusses the different ways that emerging-market claims can be analyzed.

U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> claims on Latin American and Asian emerging markets, and on industrialized countries, are sensitive to U. S. macroeconomic conditions. When the United States grows rapidly, there is substitution between claims on industrialized countries and claims on the United States. The pattern of response of claims on emerging markets to U. S. conditions differs across banks of different sizes and across emerging market regions. Moreover, we find that, unlike U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> claims on industrialized countries, claims on emerging markets are not highly sensitive to local country GDP and interest rates.

I find that during the 2008 - 2011 U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> crisis, several measures of bank stability among U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> are sensitive to an exogenous and novel measure of geographic diversification. Alternative explanations including risk-taking, competition, capital reserves or bank size cannot explain this result.

In contrast to single-equation estimates developed from the option model by others, our simultaneous-equation evidence indicates that regulators failed to prevent large U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> from shifting risk to the FDIC.

40|$|This paper employs {{stochastic}} frontier {{cost and}} profit models to estimate {{economies of scale}} as well as X-efficiency for multi-billion dollar European and U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> in the period 1995 - 1999. Empirical results with respect to separate analyses of large European and U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> are strikingly similar with decreasing (increasing) cost (profit) returns to scale. We find that large banks in Europe and the U. S. have cost and profit functions that are similar with increasing returns to scale and decreasing (increasing) scope economies for the cost (profit) model. Further analyses evaluate the reasonableness of estimating a combined cost or profit frontier for European and U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks.</b> We find that, while a single profit frontier may exist, separate cost frontiers are implied. Although profitability in absolute terms is equal, large U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> tend to exhibit higher average profit efficiency than European banks on average. Moreover, banks in the U.

If so, did market discipline play a significant role? The results suggest that only in the United States were weakly capitalized banks observed to increase their capital ratios faster than well-capitalized banks; however, the weakly capitalized U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> did not modify their risk-weighted assets at different rates from other U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks.</b> In addition, market discipline appears to have played an essential role: weakly capitalized U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> that did not also face market pressure did not increase their capital ratios faster than other U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks.</b> This suggests that market pressure was an important factor in the capital build-up of the early 1990 s. ...|$|R
40|$|U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> {{have long}} faced {{restrictions}} {{imposed by the}} Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. This act erected barriers between commercial and investment banking. Although the barriers have been eroding recently, the U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> system is still considered restrictive compared with countries that permit banks to perform {{a broad range of}} financial services (i. e., universal banking). As banking becomes increasingly global, this regulatory difference faced by U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> becomes more important in that it selectively handicaps U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> and forces them to become more competitive so that they can continue to deliver a comprehensive package of financial products to their corporate customers. In their efforts to become more competitive, coordination and structuring of foreign operations are key strategic tools. For example, foreign branches and subsidiaries have different capabilities and costs. So the choice of organizational form preferences (branches versus subsidiaries) in host countries can affect the global reach and competitiveness of U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks.</b> In this study, therefore, we examined how U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> structure their foreign operations. Specifically, we tested the influence of host countries' banking (financial) system development and regulations on U. S. banks' organizational form preferences (the combination of branches and subsidiaries established by a bank in a host country). We found that a bank's size, globalization, product diversity, and charter value influence organizational form preferences within and across different host-country banking environments. Our results are consistent with the concept of natural adaptation and flexibility, or in this case, "banking environment" flexibility. ...|$|R
