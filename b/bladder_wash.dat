Image analysis systems have been developed for quantification of cytologic fea tures. In this study, routine <b>bladder</b> <b>wash</b> cytology is compared with an automated image analysis sys tem (QUANTICYT). We studied a random set of 100 <b>bladder</b> <b>wash</b> samples from a population of 1614 patients in follow-up after bladder cancer. Four ex perienced pathologists interpreted the same 100 Pa panicolaou-stained slides. Cytologic and image analysis results were compared for prediction of a cystoscopic lesion, histologic abnormalities, and tu mor recurrence. After application of receiver oper ating characteristic curves, prediction of a cysto scopic lesion by cytology and image analysis was comparable. Both the image analysis system and the cytologic examination detected all of the high-grade lesions. Image analysis was superior to cyto logic analysis for the prediction of tumor recurrence after normal findings at cystoscopic examination...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{indwelling}} {{urinary catheter}} {{is an essential part}} of modern medical care. Unfortunately, when poorly managed, the indwelling catheter may present a hazard to the very patients it is designed to protect. Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is the most common nosocomial infection in hospitals and nursing homes. Aims and Objectives: The primary objective was to study the effect of amikacin sulfate <b>bladder</b> <b>wash</b> on CAUTI in neurosurgical patients. The other objectives were to study the various organisms causing CAUTI and their antibiotic sensitivity and resistance pattern. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective randomized controlled study performed on 60 patients who met the inclusion criteria at the neurosurgical intensive care of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences between June and December 2006. The patients were randomized into two groups - one was the trial group which received amikacin <b>bladder</b> <b>wash,</b> while the other was the control group that did not receive any <b>bladder</b> <b>wash.</b> Results: Forty percent of the subjects in the control group developed CAUTI, while none of the subjects in study group developed CAUTI. (Fisher&#x 2032;s exact test, P value < 0. 001) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (51 &#x 0025;) was the commonest pathogen. Conclusions: Amikacin sulfate <b>bladder</b> <b>wash</b> was effective in preventing CAUTI. It can thus decrease the antibiotic usage thereby preventing the emergence of antibiotic resistance...|$|E
40|$|Two {{new methods}} for the {{detection}} of transitional tumor cells in <b>bladder</b> <b>wash</b> (karyometry: QUANTICYT) and voided urine material (BARD BTA test) were compared with <b>bladder</b> <b>wash</b> cytology for the prediction of histology and tumor recurrence. <b>Bladder</b> <b>wash</b> material and voided urine were sampled from 138 patients. <b>Bladder</b> <b>wash</b> karyometric (BWK) image analysis and the BTA test were applied. A subsequent urethrocystoscopy was performed and a bladder tumor, when present, was resected. Moreover, each patient was followed for tumor recurrence and progression. Sensitivities {{for the detection}} of tumors were 34. 4 %, 44. 8 %, and 69. 0 % for the BTA test, <b>bladder</b> <b>wash</b> cytology (BWC), and BWK, respectively (BTA versus BWC, P = 0. 64; BTA versus BWK, P = 0. 0002; BWC versus BWK, P = 0. 0001, using the McNemar test). Specificities for the different tests were 81. 3 %, 92. 5 %, and 72. 5 %, respectively (BTA versus BWC, P = 0. 096; BTA versus BWK, P = 0. 031; BWC versus BWK, P = 0. 001, using the McNemar test). Combinations of tests did not result in better prediction of the presence of tumor. Sensitivity of carcinoma in situ for the three tests was 0 of 3, 3 of 3, and 3 of 3, respectively. Follow-up analysis after a negative cystoscopy revealed comparable predictive values for BWC and BWK. The BTA test may be useful for patients with recurrent, low-grade papillary lesions. However, sensitivity for detection of these lesions, although higher than that for BWC, was only 42. 9 %. The highest specificity was found for BWC; however, this was accompanied by the lowest sensitivity of all three tests. The lower specificity of BWK was accompanied by a better prediction of tumor recurrence after a normal urethrocystoscopy. BWK is particularly sensitive for the recurrence of high-grade bladder lesion...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{chromosome}} 9 p 21 locus is frequently deleted {{in the early stages of}} urothelial carcinogenesis. To study the predictive value of the 9 p 21 aberrations in recurrence of urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder, we applied dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization for 9 p 21 and chromosome 9 centromere to the <b>bladder</b> <b>washing</b> cytology samples that were obtained from the patients with urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder treated by transurethral resection. For the evaluation, the 9 p 21 index was defined as the ratio of the mean number of 9 p 21 signals per nucleus for that of the chromosome 9 centromere signals per nucleus in each of the <b>bladder</b> <b>washing</b> cytology samples. The 9 p 21 index values of the <b>bladder</b> <b>washing</b> cytology samples with no (G 0) cytologic atypia were significantly higher than those of the <b>bladder</b> <b>washing</b> cytology samples with moderate (G 2) (P 0. 9). Furthermore, 2 patients of <b>bladder</b> <b>washing</b> cytology G 1 with a low 9 p 21 index value recurred much sooner than the other patients of the <b>bladder</b> <b>washing</b> cytology G 1 category. These findings indicate that a decreased 9 p 21 index value is associated with recurrence of urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder, and the 9 p 21 index may be useful as a marker to identify patients with elevated risk of recurrence of urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. To {{evaluate}} the {{sensitivity and specificity}} of the Bard BTA test compared with <b>bladder</b> <b>washing</b> cytology in patients {{with a history of}} transitional cell bladder cancer undergoing routine follow-up cystoscopy. Methods. During routine follow-up for transitional cell bladder cancer, 75 patients underwent cystoscopy, <b>bladder</b> <b>washing</b> cytology, and the Bard BTA test, a latex agglutination test that qualitatively detects basement membrane complexes in voided urine. From October 1994 to October 1995, a total of 104 Bard BTA test examinations were performed. The results of the Bard BTA test were compared with those attained with cystoscopy and <b>bladder</b> <b>washing</b> cytology. Results. Cystoscopy found tumors in 13 cases. The Bard BTA test was diagnostic in 7 (54 %) cases; it was more sensitive than <b>bladder</b> <b>washing</b> cytology, which was positive in only 3 (23 %) cases. However, the specificity of the Bard BTA was lower (9 % clinically unconfirmed positive tests) than that attained with cytology. In 2 patients (2 %) in whom the cystoscopy was negative, the Bard BTA test was predictive for a positive cystoscopy 3 and 5 months later. Conclusions. The Bard BTA test is a noninvasive test that may be an important addition to cystoscopy and cytology in the routine surveillance of patients with a history of transitional cell cancer of the bladder.

40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} {{different aspects}} of recurrence and, when appropriate, progression in primary Ta/T 1 urinary bladder cancer. Patients and methods: All evaluable patients diagnosed with primary Ta/T 1 urinary bladder cancer in Linköping and Norrköping between 1992 and 2007 were included prospectively in the study cohort. Histopathology results were classified according to the TNM system and were reviewed by a reference pathologist using the WHO 1999 criteria (except in the studies reported in Papers I and IV). Risk factors for local recurrence were evaluated {{using data from the}} period 1992 – 2001 (Paper I). Tumour size (Paper II) and <b>bladder</b> <b>wash</b> cytology (Paper III) at primary diagnosis were assessed regarding the impact on recurrence and progression, and tumour presence in the marginal resection in primary and recurrent Ta/T 1 bladder cancer was investigated considering effects on recurrence in patients treated between 2001 and 2010 (Paper IV). Furthermore, surgical experience measured as training status (resident or specialist) and surgical volume (both during the study period and lifetime) were analysed regarding their influence on recurrence and progression (Paper V).

40|$|PURPOSE: The risk {{of muscle}} {{invasive}} disease {{in a high}} risk patient with superficial bladder cancer is up to 50 %. Identifying patients at risk for progression remains an unsolved problem. A suggested prognosticator is mutations in the p 53 tumor suppressor gene. We determined the value of p 53 mutation, as demonstrated by mutation analysis, in a clinically selected group of high risk patients with superficial bladder cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: p 53 Mutation analysis was performed by automated sequencing of <b>bladder</b> <b>wash</b> samples of 105 patients with high risk superficial bladder cancer. The mutation and WT groups were subsequently compared with regard to mortality, progression, disease worsening and the recurrence-free period. RESULTS: A total of 29 patients had a mutation and 76 had WT. Median followup was 58. 3 months (range 3 to 161). A total of 13 patients died of bladder cancer, including 6 of 29 with a mutation and 7 of 76 patients in the WT group. p 53 Mutation had no significant prognostic value for decreased survival, progression or disease worsening. Recurrence-free survival was significantly lower in the WT group. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a trend toward a worse clinical outcome in high risk patients with a p 53 mutation in the <b>bladder</b> <b>wash.</b> However, {{no significant differences were}} seen in clinical outcome parameters. Based on these data we conclude that the prognostic value of a p 53 mutation is insufficient for individual policy making...|$|E

This study {{addresses}} the diagnostic {{value of the}} Nuclear Matrix Protein 22 (NMP 22) test and the Urinary Bladder Cancer (UBC II) test, in comparison to <b>bladder</b> <b>wash</b> cytology {{for the detection of}} early recurrence of bladder cancer. Patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (TCC, n = 60) and patients with benign urological diseases (n = 30) were included in this study. Voided urine samples were divided into 2 aliquots: aliquot 1 was assayed for NMP 22 and aliquot 2 was tested for UBC II. Saline bladder washings were used for cytologic examination. Urine samples from TCC patients were collected before transurethral resection and on postoperative day 10. On day 10, 15 NMP 22 results and 7 UBC II results exceeded the normal ranges; 4 of the cytology samples were positive for malignancy. Based on cystoscopic findings at 3 mo post-resection, 21 of the cases were classified as early recurrence; 11 of the early recurrences had been in the elevated NMP 22 group, 4 in the elevated UBC II group, and 3 in the positive cytology group at 10 days post-resection. The NMP 22 test gave the highest sensitivity for detecting early recurrent tumors (11 of 21, 52 %). Such high sensitivity did not occur with the UBC II test (4 of 21, 19 %) or cytology (3 of 21, 14 %). These differences were significant (p = 0. 024 and 0. 009, respectively). Thus, the NMP 22 test showed superiority over the other tests for detection of early recurrence of bladder cancer...|$|E
40|$|Cell-mediated immune {{response}} can control tuberculosis infection. A significant role for immune cells like CD 4, CD 8 and gammadelta T lymphocytes have been recognized, but {{little is known}} about the kinetics of activation and accumulation of these cells in course of Tuberculosis infection in humans. This is due to both the difficult to access to human lung and the fact that most subjects are examined in different periods of infection which may condition T cell changes. To overcome these problems, we have used intravesical BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) treatment for preventing the recurrences of bladder cancer as an in vivo experimental model of human tuberculosis infection. 20 male caucasian patients with proven bladder superficial transitional cell carcinoma treated with transurethral resection followed by six weekly intravesical instillations of BCG (T 0 -T 6) were enrolled. Changes in T lymphocyte subsets were assessed by flow cytometry in the <b>bladder</b> <b>wash</b> recovered after each BCG instillation. Our study shows that the action of BCG appears to be T cell dependent. Lymphocytes increase at any new instillation and tend towards the reduction with the suspension of the stimulus. BCG induces a massive increase in the proportion of CD 4 Th 1 subset followed by an increase in gammadelta T cells, while no significant variation for CD 8 and NK cells is found.

40|$|Intravesical {{chemotherapy}} and immunotherapy with BCG represent the standard therapy to prevent recurrence after transurethral resection (TUR) of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMI-BC). Maintenance {{for at least}} one year is considered the best regimen. Noteworthy, a relevant number of patients do not complete the planned treatment due to local toxicity of the drug given intravesically 1, 2. A major challenge for the urologists is to identify an early urothelial damage biomarker to prevent severe local toxicity requiring treatment interruption and to improve patient's compliance. The preliminary purpose of our research was to verify the possible correlation between urothelial damage induced by intravesical treatment and the expression of potential biomarkers in urine or <b>bladder</b> <b>washing</b> solution. Fibronectin (FN), Epidermal Growth Factor-Receptor (EGF-R) and Heparin-binding Epidermal Growth Factor-like Growth Factor (HB-EGF) have been preliminary investigated. The urinary HB-EGF expression in patients with interstitial cystitis has been already analyzed by some studies 3, 4, 5 The biomarkers trend during therapy with hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate solution will be investigated. Materials and Methods: we collected 50 ml urine and <b>bladder</b> <b>washing</b> solution during intravesical therapy in 55 patients after NMI-BC TUR and in 10 healty controls for a total of 200 samples. After centrifugation, total cellular RNA was isolated from the cell pellett using miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen®) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We investigated FN and EGF-R gene expression by Real Time quantitative PCR. Finally, the abundance of HB-EGF in urine samples was measured using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Abcam®) following manufacturer's instructions. Results: The FN gene expression levels in NMI-BC compared with controls were increased 4. 7 fold while EGF-R levels were decreased 0. 9 fold. In the patients in whom local toxicity due to intravesical therapy was clinically relevant, the FN gene expression levels were increased 5. 82 fold, and the EGF-R one was decreased 0. 88 fold. In contrast patients before starting therapy or with a good tolerance showed gene expression levels increased 1. 9 fold for FN and 1. 1 fold for EGF-R. In patients receiving hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate solution to treat the severe vesical toxicity the average FN gene expression levels were decreased from 3 to 0. 6 fold, with concomitant symptomatic improvement. HB-EGF protein levels in urine in patients receiving intravesical chemo or immunotherapy were increased 1. 2 fold compared to controls and remained unchanged during therapy. No fold change was detected in patients treated with hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate solution. Our preliminary data will be updated in the final presentation. Statistical analysis is ongoing. Conclusion: EGF-R gene expression in the <b>bladder</b> <b>washing</b> solution and HB-EGF levels in urine did not show significant fold change in relation to urothelial damage compared to controls.

We used cytometric and clinical data from a chemoprevention trial of the synthetic retinoid Fenretinide on 99 patients with superficial bladder cancer. A total of 642 <b>bladder</b> <b>washing</b> specimens obtained from the patients at 4 month intervals was analyzed. Intra-individual agreement and correlation of flow cytometric DNA ploidy (diploid vs. aneuploid), DNA Index, Hyper-Diploid-Fraction (proportion of cells with DNA content higher than 2 C), and conventional cytologic examination, as assessed by kappa statistics and Spearman's correlation test, were poor from baseline through 24 months. Moreover, no correlation was found between DNA ploidy and cytology at each time point. The same results were obtained when the analyses were stratified by treatment group. In addition, the association between the results of <b>bladder</b> <b>washing</b> (by either DNA flow cytometry or cytology) and concomitant tumor recurrence was significant only for abnormal cytology, while neither biomarker was predictive of tumor recurrence at the subsequent visit. During {{the time of this}} study only four patients progressed to muscle-invasive bladder cancer, indicating the 'low-risk' features of the patient population.

40|$|Non-muscle {{invasive}} bladder {{encompasses the}} relatively innocent low risk tumours, {{but also the}} potentially lethal high risk tumours. Low risk tumours have a high chance of recurrence, but high risk tumours have both {{a high risk of}} recurrence and progression. Progression to muscle-invasive disease implies a much higher mortality. So frequent surveillance is necessary for all patients within this spectrum. This surveillance is done by cystoscopy and cytology. In this thesis, new markers in diagnosis and prognosis of non-muscle invasive (superficial) bladder cancer are being evaluated. The NMP 22 ® BladderChek® Test, UroVysion®, and quantitative cytology are being studied as diagnostic markers. The most promising test seems to be UroVysion® (FISH). Quantitative cytology, a <b>bladder</b> <b>wash</b> marker earlier developed in the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, is adapted and now can be performed on urine. The p 53 tumour suppressor gene is evaluated in two large retrospective studies, unfortunately the earlier promising results could not be confirmed.

Most likely it is not a single marker that will predict recurrence or even progression in this disease, but a panel of markers. Currently the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre is studying a high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, detecting genomic instability characteristic for bladder cancer.

40|$|Background: Urinary {{cytology}} has low {{sensitivity and}} specificity in urinary neoplasm. Aim: We planned to assess whether the examination of bladder washing before biopsy (WBB) {{plays a role in}} better cytologic diagnosis of <b>bladder</b> <b>wash</b> fluid collected after biopsy procedure (WAB) in papillary urothelial neoplasms. Materials and Methods: We included 36 patients with papillary lesion of bladder. Prior to the biopsy, the bladder is washed and fluid is collected for cytology; later transurethral resection (TUR) is performed, then bladders are washed again and the fluid is separately collected for cytology. Both fluids were centrifuged and stained with May-Grünwald Giemsa (MGG). First the WAB slides were evaluated and diagnosed. After evaluation of the WBB slides, the WAB slides were rediagnosed. Presence of cellularity, papillary structure, fusiform cells, background bleeding, and cytolysis in WBB and WAB were evaluated separately. Results: We determined that 31 WBB samples were hypercellular, and 12 of them remained as hypercellular in WAB. Papillary structures were observed in 20 WBB samples; and in one WAB cytology. In 29 cases where no fusiform cells are identified in WBB, 22 showed fusiform cells in WAB. Cytolysis in WABs was noted in 15 cases whose WBBs did not show cytolysis. The decrease in cellularity, papillary structure (P < 0. 001, both), cytolysis (P = 0. 008), and fusiform cells (P < 0. 001) were statistically significant. After seeing the WBB slides, we reevaluated the WAB slides. Out of the eight out of 36 (22. 2 %) samples diagnosed with degeneration previously, five (62. 5 %) samples were rediagnosed as benign, two (25 %) as cytologic atypia which favor reactive, and one (12. 5 %) as malignant.

40|$|Blood in {{the urine}} {{is the most common}} {{indication}} that something is wrong. Often one will experience pain or difficulty upon urination, frequency of urination, or have irritation along with urgency. After symptoms and/or urinalysis have indicated a cause for concern, the next steps for staging would most likely include {{some or all of the}} following diagnostic procedures; Cystoscopy, <b>bladder</b> <b>wash</b> cytology, biopsy and/or bladder mapping, IVP, Ultra Sonography, pathology tests. Bone scans and CT scans may be used, though doctors will use their judgement, and don&rsquo;t usually prescribe them if the cancer appears to be non-muscle-invasive. MRI&rsquo;s have been shown to be helpful in experimental studies, but are also not usually used for initial staging. PET scans have been shown to be very helpful and even more accurate that CT or MRI in diagnosing distant metastases, but they are not yet approved for bladder cancer diagnostics and have potential drawbacks when trying to stage local disease (see imaging studies). Although these new imaging modalities have been shown to be helpful in some instances, they cannot replace cystoscopy for detection of small tumors. The stage refers to how far a cancer has progressed anatomically, while the grade refers to cell appearance (differentiation) and DNA make up. Stage is determined by the depth to which the tumor has penetrated the bladder wall, and assessment of invasion of lymph nodes and other surrounding organs and tissues. Tumors that pose a high risk for progression and death are multifocal (multiple tumors in more than one area of the bladder) Ta lesions, tumors with associated carcinoma in situ (also written as Tis or CIS), and T 1 lesions.

40|$|Introduction and Objectives: The {{intravesical}} {{administration of}} hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate solution (HA-CS) {{has been proven}} active in patients affected by interstitial cystitis (1). The gene expression of fibronectin (FN) in bladder washings has recently been correlated with local toxicity of adjuvant intravesical therapy (2). The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the genetic evidence of the healing or protective action that HA-CS could carry out also in patients suffering from topical toxicity induced by intravesical adjuvant therapy given for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Materials and Methods: The study included 50 patients submitted to adjuvant intravesical therapy with mitomycin, epirubicin or bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG). Ten age-matched healthy patients were enrolled as control group. Before, during and after intravescical therapy, <b>bladder</b> <b>washing</b> samples were collected to investigate the gene expression of FN. In 9 more patients the samples were collected also immediately before and a week after the instillation of HA-CS. Topical toxicity was classified into 3 grades: 0 - 1, light (no medical therapy); 2, moderate (medical therapy); 3, severe (instillation postponed). <b>Bladder</b> <b>washing</b> samples were analyzed by isolation of cellular RNA using a miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen®). RT-PCR was performed in order to analyze FN gene expression. Changes in the FN content were calculated using the ΔΔCt method after normalization with endogenous reference 18 s rRNA and calibrating Ct value for each RNA obtained for triplicate reactions. Statistical analysis was performed to correlate the FN gene expression to tumor characteristics, treatment, topical toxicity and intravesical administration of HA-CS.

40|$|Background. Light {{microscopic}} evaluation of cell morphology in preparations from urine or <b>bladder</b> <b>washing</b> containing exfoliated cells {{is a standard}} and primary method {{for the detection of}} bladder cancer and also malignancy {{from other parts of the}} urinary tract. The cytopathologic examination is a valuablemethod to detect an early recurrence of malignancy or new primary carcinoma during the follow-up of patients after the treatment of bladder cancer. Conclusions. Characteristic cellular and nuclear signs of malignancy indicate invasive or in situ urothelial carcinoma or high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma. However, low sensitivity of the method reflects the unreliable cytopathologic diagnosis of low-grade urothelial neoplasms as cellular and nuclear signs of malignancy in these neoplasms are poorly manifested. Many different markers were developed to improve the diagnosis of bladder carcinoma on urinary samples. UroVysionT test is among the newest and most promising tests. By the method of in situ hybridization one can detect specific cytogenetic changes of urothelial carcinoma...|$|R
40|$|Effect {{of locally}} {{administered}} polymyxin B (PB) solution on postoperative {{urinary tract infection}} was studied. 1) Patients consisted of 24 males and 9 females, who received urological operations and indwelling catheters in the bladder or renal pelvis after the operation. 2) PB solution was locally administered every day after the operation in the following ways: Group l-(a) : <b>bladder</b> <b>washing</b> with 0. 05 % solution of PB in 6 cases. Group l-(b) : <b>bladder</b> <b>washing</b> with 0. 1 % solution of PB in 16 cases. Group 2 : intravesical instillation of 0. 1 % solution of PB in 2 cases. Group 3 : continuous bladder irrigation through indwelling 3 -way catheter with 0. 0025 % solution of PB in 9 cases. Group 4 : washing or irrigation through nephrostomy with 0. 05 or 0. 1 % solution of PB in 3 cases. 3) Species and colony counts of bacteria in urine were examined before and on {{the course of the}} treatment. The results of the treatment were evaluated successful when the bacteria disappeared or the colony counts diminished after the finish of PB administration. Successful results were obtained as follows: 5 cases of 6 in group l-(a), S cases of 16 in group l-(b), 1 case of 2 in group 2, 7 cases of 9 in group 3 and 0 case of 3 in group 4. In both group l-(a) and 3, the results were remarkable in comparison with the other 3 groups. Evaluation of the latter group, however, was thought to be difficult because of different causes of the diseaes, operative methods and other conditions of the patients. 4) Effective rate of polymyxin B was more than 51 % of counted strains in Proteus morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli, Citrobactor, Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. In contrast, it was less than 50 % in Serratia, Klebsiella, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri and glucose non-fermentable Gram negative rods (NFGNR). 5) Serratia and Proteus were detected most frequently, and NFGNR appeared continuously before and after the treatment. These findings showed the same tendency of superinfection as recent reports of urinary tract infection...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: High-risk human {{papilloma}} virus (HPV) types stimulate {{degradation and}} deactivation of protein {{associated with the}} p 53 tumour suppressor gene via the ubiquitin-dependent pathway. For a long time, changes of the p 53 tumour suppressor gene have been correlated with poor clinical outcome in patients with superficial bladder cancer. We aimed to study the association between presence of (high-risk) HPV DNA, p 53 status, and clinical outcome in bladder cancer patients. This study {{must be seen as}} a preliminary study to investigate this potentially important problem. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 107 patients, 166 <b>bladder</b> <b>wash</b> samples were obtained. p 53 status was determined by mutation analysis, HPV detection, and genotyping by the SPF(10) -LiPA assay. Clinical data were abstracted from the medical files. RESULTS: The prevalence of all-type and high-risk HPV infection in malignancies of the bladder was 15. 2 % and 8. 1 %, respectively. In high-grade tumours this prevalence was 18. 2 % and 10. 6 %, respectively. In grade 1, 2 and 3 tumours the infection rate of high-risk HPV types was 0 %, 3. 3 %, and 10. 6 %, respectively (trend test: p= 0. 221). In Ta, T 1, and T 2 -T 4 tumours the high-risk HPV infection rate was 0 %, 12. 5 % and 18. 2 %, respectively (trend test: p= 0. 045). In the p 53 wild-type patients who showed progression, 1 of 9 patients had a high-risk type HPV infection. In the group of wild-type patients who showed no progression, 4 of 37 patients had a high-risk type HPV infection (odds ratio: 1. 03; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 1 - 10. 5). CONCLUSIONS: The data of this pilot study show the suggestion of a positive trend in the correlation between tumour grade/stage and high-risk type HPV infection. However, no additional risk for progression is found for p 53 wild-type patients with a high-risk HPV infection...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction and {{objectives}} Nephroureterectomy remains {{the gold standard}} treatment option for upper tract tumors. However, segmental ureterectomy may be another option in patients with single kidney, borderline renal function or high medical comorbidities. The aim of this video is to assess the feasibility of robotic surgery as a minimally invasive technique in treatment of a high comorbid patient with ureteric tumor. Materials and Methods Eighty-year old male patient, with a medical history of chronic hypertensive and uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus, was referred to our department for treatment of ureteric tumor. Patient underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy 5 years ago. Patient’s Charlson comorbidity index score was 9. Computed tomography showed a 2. 5 cm right ureteral luminal filling enhancing lesion at lower part of upper 1 / 3 ureter. We performed diagnostic flexible cystoscopy under local anesthesia to exclude associated lower urinary tract carcinoma, and <b>bladder</b> <b>wash</b> was negative for malignancy. Under general anesthesia patient underwent diagnostic flexible ureteroscopy to confirm mass location, and a retrograde pyelography to rule out additional tumors on the right collecting system. Then, the patient {{was placed in the}} full lateral flank position without Table flexion. Ports placement were inserted as follow: a “ 12 mm” optical trocar at pararectal line superior and lateral to umbilicus, two “ 8 mm” robotic trocars cranial and caudal to optical trocar (8 cm distance), a “ 8 mm” robotic trocar towards anterior superior ischial spine, and a “ 12 mm” assistant trocar was inserted between umbilicus and pubic bone. The surgical steps are shown in the video. Results The procedure was performed easily. The total operative time and consol time were 100 and 60 minutes, respectively. Blood loss was 50 ml. No reported intraoperative or postoperative complications. Notably, we took full precautions in case of intraoperative failure to complete the procedure successfully, nephroureterectomy was our second option. Postoperative serum creatinine was 1. 2 mg/dL and length of hospital stay was 2 days. The frozen biopsy showed that the tumor was resected with safe proximal and distal surgical margins. Final histopathology revealed high grade (G 3) urothelial carcinoma (pT 3), measures (1. 3 x 1. 2 x 0. 2 cm), associated with carcinoma in situ. Conclusion We affirm that robotic segmental ureterectomy and ureteroureterostomy could be offered safely as a minimally invasive treatment for patients with ureteric tumors and high-risk medical comorbidities. It provides excellent perioperative outcomes and early oncological safety with regard to surgical margins...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{replication}} in yeast is initiated from discrete chromosomal locations (origins of DNA replication) {{controlled by}} sequential assembly of replication complexes {{that include the}} initiation proteins ORC, CDC 6, CDC 45 and MCM proteins. These initiation proteins are regulated in the cell cycles both in yeast and human. In human, hCDC 6 and hMCM {{have been shown to}} be expressed in cycling but not in quiescent human cells. Antibodies against hCDC 6 and hMCM proteins {{have been shown to be}} sensitive for cancer detection. We have investigated whether detection of the mRNAs of the DNA replication initiation genes hCDC 6, hMCM and hCDC 45 in urinary cells from bladder cancer patients could be used as markers for cancer detection. We have analyzed urine samples from 44 bladder cancer and 3 bladder dysplasia patients, 23 <b>bladder</b> <b>wash</b> and 4 tissue samples from bladder cancer patients, 4 dysplasia tissue samples, 16 urine samples from ureteric stone or renal stone patients, and 30 normal urine samples as the negative controls. The molecular method RT-PCR was used to detect hCDC 6, hMCM, hCDC 45 and the internal control β-actin mRNAs. The results were compared to those obtained by clinical cystoscopy, biopsy and urine cytology. One hundred percent of the 47 urine samples from the 44 transitional cell carcinomas and 3 dysplasia cases gave positive signals for hMCM whereas 97 % of the normal control samples gave a negative result. The expression of hCDC 6 and hCDC 45 was directly related to TCC grades. These results indicated that these DNA initiation genes can be used as detection markers for bladder cancer under the non-invasive condition, and may even for early detection of bladder cancer. Interestingly, most stone samples also gave positive signals. We have also analyzed 74 urine samples from patients underwent recurrence follow up for bladder cancer. The results showed that the molecular method with hCDC 6 and hCDC 45 could help to eliminate ~ 50 % of the non-recurrence patients whom could be spared from the expensive and invasive cystoscopy. This could greatly reduce the cost and suffering of follow up surveillance of existing and future bladder cancer. The RT-PCR method for cancer detection may not only detect bladder cancer but also cancer in other organs. We have tested this method for detection of nasopharyneal cancer (NPC) by detecting the ratio of hCDC 6 /β-actin as the marker. We have analyzed 18 NPC and 5 control samples. Fifteen out of the 18 NPC samples gave a ratio higher than 0. 7 while 4 in 5 of the control had lower than 0. 7 values. These findings suggest that the hCDC 6 /β-actin ratio in NPC tissues may be a useful diagnosis marker for NPC...|$|E
40|$|AIMS [...] To analyse the {{diagnostic}} value of cytological examination compared with histological findings {{in a large}} series of patients (n = 615) with tumours of the urinary tract epithelium. METHODS [...] Cytological examinations (n = 785) after <b>bladder</b> <b>washing</b> and exfoliative cytology were retrospectively compared and correlated with histological findings. In addition, 1527 bladder washings were obtained during follow up of patients after transurethral resection of bladder tumours. RESULTS [...] Cytology in bladder washings (overall diagnostic accuracy 66 %) provides considerably more information that exfoliative cytology (overall accuracy 49 %). Cytological examinations (n = 1125) in patients with bladder tumours receiving intravesical cytostatic drugs (for example, mitomycin C) yielded suspicious or positive results in 28 % of patients, without being confirmed by endoscopy during follow up. CONCLUSION [...] Our results illustrate two major drawbacks of urinary cytology. First, {{a high rate of}} false positive results in patients on intravesical chemotherapy.

40|$|Abstract: Many tumor markers for bladder cancer {{have been}} {{evaluated}} for use in detecting and monitoring bladder cancers tissue specimens, <b>bladder</b> <b>washes,</b> and urine specimens. However, none of the biomarkers reported to date has shown suffi cient sensitivity and specifi city to detect the entire spectrum of bladder cancers in routine clinical practice. The limited value of the established prognostic markers demands analysis of new molecular parameters having the potential to predict the prog-nosis of bladder cancer patients, particularly, the high-risk patients at risk of cancer progression and recurrence. Abnormal methylation of CpG islands can effi ciently repress transcription of the associated gene in a manner akin to mutations and deletions. Several tumor suppressor genes correlated with bladder cancer contain CpG islands in their promoters. Markers for aberrant methylation may be a potential gateway for monitoring bladder cancer. Hypermethylation of several gene promoters was detected in urine sediment DNA from bladder cancer patients. Detection of DNA methylation in voided urine is feasible and noninvasive. Methylation is an important molecular mechanism {{in the development of}} bladder cancer and {{could be used as a}} prognostic and diagnostic marker. Aberrant patterns of epigenetic modifi cation could, in the near future, be crucial indicators in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and may additionally be good targets for developing nove...|$|R
40|$|Bladder {{cancer is}} the fifth most {{commonly}} diagnosed malignancy in the United States {{and one of the}} most prevalent worldwide. It harbors a probability of recurrence of> 50 %; thus, rigorous, long-term surveil-lance of patients is advocated. Flexible cystoscopy coupled with voided urine cytology is the primary diagnostic approach, but cystoscopy is an uncomfort-able, invasive procedure and the sensitivity of voided urine cytology is poor in all but high-grade tumors. Thus, improvements in noninvasive urinalysis assess-ment strategies would benefit patients. We applied gene expression microarray analysis to exfoliated urothelia recovered from <b>bladder</b> <b>washes</b> obtained prospectively from 46 patients with subsequently confirmed presence or absence of bladder cancer. Data from microarrays containing 56, 000 targets was sub-jected to a panel of statistical analyses to identify bladder cancer-associated gene signatures. Hierarchical clustering and supervised learning algorithms were used to classify samples on the basis of tumor burden. A differentially expressed geneset of 319 gene probes was associated with the presence of bladder cancer (P < 0. 01), and visualization of protein interaction networks revealed vascular endothelial growth factor and angio-tensinogen as pivotal factors in tumor cells. Supervised machine learning and a cross-validation approach were used to build a 14 -gene molecular classifier that was able to classify patients with and without bladder cancer with an overall accuracy of 76 %. Our results show that it is possible to achieve the detection of bladder cancer using molecular signatures present in exfoliated tumor urothelia. Further investigation and validation of the cancer-associated profiles may reveal important biomarkers for the noninvasive detection and surveillance of bladder cancer.

40|$|Urinary bladder carcinomas (UBC) {{frequently}} recur. During {{the intervals}} “free‐ofneoplasia”, between the initially diagnosed tumor and its recurrences, {{there are not}} undisputable histological alterations in the mucosa, although some studies have reported DNA damage in urothelial cells. In order to understand developmental characteristics of UBC, primary tumors and their recurrences were cytogenetically evaluated for their genomic expression by High Resolution Comparative Genomic Hybridization (HR‐CGH). Tumors and their respective recurrences, six low‐grade (LG) and five high‐grade (HG) cases, provided 20 tissue samples that were submitted to laser microdissection capture followed by HR‐CGH. HR‐CGH profiles had two different analyses – all tumors altogether or classified according to their respective histological grades. Both comparisons showed high frequency (80 %) of gains in 11 p 12 and losses in 16 p 12, {{in agreement with the}} literature that indicate alterations of 11 p and 16 p in UBC recurrences. These findings suggest that those chromosome regions contain putative oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes critical for urinary bladder carcinogenesis. Within a same patient genomic profile showed high agreement between tumors and their respective recurrences, i. e., tumors from the same patient showed a large number of common losses and gains. The high similarities of genomic alterations in successive tumors from the same patient suggest that a stable genomic profile was established in UBCs and their recurrences. Besides, during the “free‐of‐neoplasia” intervals, negative urinary <b>bladder</b> <b>washes</b> were submitted to Fluorescent in situ Hybridization (FISH) to detect quantitative alterations in centromeres 7 (n= 21 samples), 17 (n= 21) and 9 p 21 (n= 36).

40|$|Introduction and Objectives: Epidermal {{growth factor}} (EGF) {{is a strong}} tumor promoter. Its {{concentration}} is reduced in urine of patients affected by bladder cancer supporting {{the important role of}} its interaction with the urothelial epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGF-R) in tumor development and progression (1, 2). It would be of great usefulness to evaluate EGF-R gene expression during follow-up of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMI-BC) avoiding tissue biopsy. The objective of our research was to investigate the feasibility of EGF-R evaluation in bladder washings of patients affected by NMI-BC. Materials and Methods: The study included patients undergoing adjuvant intravesical therapy for NMI-BC and age-matched healthy controls. In a preliminary phase of our research, <b>bladder</b> <b>washing</b> was selected for EGF-R analysis due to the high variability and easier contamination of urine. Samples of bladder washings were collected before, during and after adjuvant intravesical therapy and during the follow-up to investigate the gene expression of EGF-R. After collection, the samples were centrifuged twice at 4 ˚C, 1, 200 rpm for 10 minutes, in cold phosphate-buffered saline solution. The cellular pellet was stored at – 80 ˚C and later analyzed by isolation of cellular RNA using a miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen®). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed in order to analyze EGF-R gene expression. Changes in the EGF-R content were calculated using the ooCt method after normalization with endogenous reference and calibrating cycle threshold (Ct) value for each RNA obtained for triplicate reactions. The percentage of patients with bladder washings giving a useful pellet for EGF-R determination was considered for the feasibility. EGF-R gene expression was related to tumor characteristics and compared to healthy controls. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed. Results: Thirty-two patients and 13 healthy controls were entered in the study. Fifty-two samples were obtained. A useful pellet to evaluate EGF-R expression was obtained in 26 patients (81. 2...|$|R
40|$|Retinoids {{have shown}} a {{potential}} activity in preventing tumor recurrence in superficial bladder cancer. We assessed {{the activity of the}} synthetic retinoid fenretinide in superficial bladder cancer using DNA flow cytometry and conventional cytology as surrogate biomarkers. A total of 99 subjects with resected superficial bladder cancer (pTa, pT 1) were randomized to either fenretinide (200 mg day p. o. for 24 months) or no intervention. Cystoscopy and <b>bladder</b> <b>washing</b> for DNA flow cytometry end points (proportion of DNA aneuploid histograms, hyperdiploid fraction, and percentage of apoptotic cells) and proportion of abnormal cytological examinations were repeated every 4 months for up to 36 months. The primary study end point was the proportion of DNA aneuploid histograms after 12 months. This figure was 48. 9 % in the fenretinide arm and 41. 9 % in the control arm (odds ratio, 1. 16; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 44 - 3. 07). There was no difference in any other response biomarker between the two groups up to 36 months, nor was any biomarker able to predict recurrence risk. Recurrence-free survival was comparable between the arms (27 events in the fenretinide arm versus 21 in the control arm; P = 0. 36). Twelve subjects in the fenretinide arm complained of diminished dark adaptability, and nine subjects in the fenretinide arm versus one control subject had mild dermatological alterations. We conclude that fenretinide showed a lack of effect on the DNA content distribution and the morphology of urothelial cells obtained in serial bladder washings. Recurrence-free survival was comparable between groups. Because our data are hampered by the lack of predictivity of the selected biomarkers, additional studies are necessary to assess the activity of fenretinide in preventing bladder cancer...|$|R

40|$|Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) may {{progress}} to muscle-invasive disease, but no effective preventive treatments are available. In addition, no reliable prognostic biomarkers have been identified. We assessed the long-term {{effect of the}} oral retinoid fenretinide and the prognostic value of circulating VEGF levels. We updated through the Tumor Registry the vital status of 99 patients with resected Ta/T 1 bladder tumors who were recruited in a randomized trial of 2 years of fenretinide or no treatment in 1993 - 1994. Serum VEGF levels measured at baseline and 12 months were available in a subgroup of 62 patients. After a median of 20. 5 years, 54 subjects died, 35 of any cancer and 14 of bladder cancer. Neither overall survival (OS), nor cancer survival (CS) or bladder cancer survival (BCS) was affected by fenretinide (log-rank P ≥ 0. 2). DNA aneuploidy in <b>bladder</b> <b>washing</b> was associated with shorter OS (P = 0. 02), CS (P = 0. 05), and BCS (P = 0. 09). Subjects with baseline VEGF levels in the top quintile (≥ 350 pg/mL) had a significantly shorter OS (P = 0. 01), CS (P = 0. 02), and BCS (P= 0. 008). The trend across quintiles of VEGF was significant for BCS (P = 0. 007). Multivariate analyses showed that, in addition to smoking status, VEGF level in the top quintile was an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR = 2. 7; 95 % CI, 1. 1 - 6. 5), CS (HR = 3. 3; 95 % CI, 1. 1 - 9. 4) and BCS (HR = 8. 9; 95 % CI, 1. 3 - 61).

40|$|Introduction/Aim: Chemotherapy or BCG given intravesically {{to prevent}} {{recurrence}} after transurethral resection (TUR) of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMI-BC) cause frequent, sometime severe, local toxicity. As a consequence, many patients do not complete the planned treatment (1). A major {{challenge for the}} urologists is to identify an early biomarker of urothelial damage to recognize and prevent local toxicity improving patient’s compliance. The purpose of our research {{was to investigate the}} relation between urothelial injury by intravesical treatment and the expression of potential biomarkers in urine and/or in barbotage solution. The urinary HB-EGF expression in interstitial cystitis has been analyzed by a few studies (2, 3). As a preliminary step, the variations of Fibronectin (FN), Epidermal Growth Factor- Receptor (EGF-R) and Heparin-binding Epidermal Growth Factor-like Growth Factor (HB-EGF) during intravesical therapy and after the administration of a solution with the potential role of urothelial repairing (hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate) were investigated. Patients and Methods: the toxicity of intravesical therapy with mitomycin, epirubicin or BCG was classified in 3 grades (absent, moderate, severe). Urine and <b>bladder</b> <b>washing</b> solution during intravesical therapy in 55 patients after NMI-BC TUR and in 10 healthy controls for a total of 200 samples were collected. Total cellular RNA was isolated from the cell pellet using miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen®). FN and EGF-R gene expression by Real Time quantitative PCR were analyzed. The expression of HB-EGF was measured in urine samples by ELISA (Abcam®). Results: In barbotage samples the FN gene expression and the EGF-R levels in our patients were respectively increased a median of 4. 7 fold and decreased of 0. 9 fold compared to controls. Before intravesical therapy and in absence of local toxicity, gene expression increased 1. 9 fold for FN and 1. 1 fold for EGF-R. In contrast, in patients with local toxicity due to intravesical therapy, the FN gene expression levels increased to a median of 5. 82 fold, while EGF-R remained unchanged. The administration of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate solution decreased the mean FN gene expression from 3 to 0. 6 fold, with concomitant symptomatic relief. HB-EGF protein median urine levels were 25. 7 pg/ml in 13 patients before intravesical therapy and 18. 9 pg/ml in 5 healthy controls. No significant variations in relation to the local toxicity. During therapy median HB-EGF protein levels in urine varied from 21. 6 pg/ml in absence of toxicity to 25. 7 pg/ml in case of severe toxicity to 18. 5 pg/ml after hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate solution. Preliminarily, the observed variations of HB-EGF, increasing no more than 1. 2 fold compared to healthy controls, do not seem possible marker of urothelial damage. Discussion and Conclusion: EGF-R gene and HBEGF expressions do not seem to vary significantly in relation to local toxicity due to intravesical therapy. FN gene is overexpressed in presence of urothelial damage significantly reduced by intravesical hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate solution administration, according with symptoms relief...|$|R
