40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{reconstruction}} of a building, starting from a point cloud. The shape of this building is a non-stellar concave and multi-connected structure, composed of sowns and chains. A sown is the representation of a horizontal plane formed by dense points. A chain is a planar loop modeled by rare points. CCTV structure is defined only by the three orthogonal Cartesian coordinates. The reconstruction uses a sequence of procedures and the desired output is a consistent 3 D model. The first procedure <b>is</b> <b>devoted</b> <b>to</b> attributing points to their voxel and to estimating the three values needed afterwards. The second procedure <b>is</b> <b>devoted</b> <b>to</b> analyzing clusters vertically and horizontally, to preliminarily distinguishing chains from sowns and to generating relational matching. The third procedure <b>is</b> <b>devoted</b> <b>to</b> building closed loops between all chains and all their projections on sowns.
