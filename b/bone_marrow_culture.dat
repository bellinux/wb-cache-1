40|$|Patients with {{a spinal}} cord section loose a {{significant}} amount of bone. After paraplegia, bone loss occurs below the lesional level and is the more dramatic in iliac bones and in the metaphyseal area of long bones. A peak of urinary calcium and hydroxyprolinuria is observed approximately 6 weeks after their lesion. To further understand the mechanisms underlying the bone damage, we used long-term <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>cultures</b> to compare osteoclast-like (OCL-like) cell formation above and below the lesional level. Seven paraplegic, one quadriparetic, one quadriplegic patients and five normal subjects were investigated. Six weeks after their spinal cord section, the number of OCL-like cells formed in iliac <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>cultures</b> was significantly greater than those formed in sternal <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>cultures</b> for all paraplegic patients tested. No significant differences were seen between iliac and sternal <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>cultures</b> for the quadriparetic, the quadriplegic patient, or for the five normal subjects. Conditioned media (CM) from iliac marrow of paraplegic patients increased OCL-like cell formation in normal <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>cultures.</b> IL- 1, TNF-alpha, IL- 6, and PGE 2 were measured in the CM after 3 weeks of culture. IL- 6 was found to be significantly higher in iliac CM compared with sternal CM in six out of seven paraplegic patients. In two patients, addition of an anti-IL- 6 monoclonal antibody to the <b>marrow</b> <b>cultures</b> significantly decreased the number of OCL-like cells formed at 3 weeks. We conclude that paraplegia caused by a cord section locally induces an increase in the capacity of progenitors to form OCL-like cells in long-term <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>cultures.</b> A locally increased IL- 6 production in the marrow below the lesional level could be partly responsible for this observation.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Inhibition of prolyl hydroxylases stimulates bone regeneration. Consequently, bone {{substitute}} materials were developed that release prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors. However, {{the impact of}} prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors released from these carriers on osteoclastogenesis is not clear. We therefore assessed the effect of {{bone substitute}} materials that release prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors on osteoclastogenesis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Dimethyloxalylglycine, desferrioxamine, and l-mimosine were lyophilized onto bovine bone mineral and hydroxyapatite, and supernatants were generated. Osteoclastogenesis was induced in murine <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>cultures</b> {{in the presence of}} the supernatants from bone substitute materials. The formation of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) -positive multinucleated cells and TRAP activity were determined. To test for possible effects on osteoclast progenitor cells, we measured the effect of the supernatants on proliferation and viability. In addition, experiments were performed where prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors were directly added to the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>cultures.</b> RESULTS We found that prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors released within the first hours from bone substitute materials reduce the number and activity of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells. In line with this, addition of prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors directly to the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>cultures</b> dose-dependently reduced the number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells and the overall resorption activity. Moreover, the released prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors decreased proliferation but not viability of osteoclast progenitor cells.

40|$|SummaryObjectivesBecause of the {{suboptimal}} {{recovery rate}} of brucellae from blood, {{it has been}} proposed that cultures of bone marrow, liver tissue, and lymph nodes may improve the recovery rate of the organism. Data in support of these recommendations are limited and not clearly convincing, especially that of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>culture.</b> The main purpose of this work was to evaluate the roles of blood, bone marrow, liver, and lymph node cultures in the diagnosis of human brucellosis. MethodsBlood and bone marrow cultures were evaluated in parallel in 103 cases of human brucellosis using Castaneda's biphasic technique. Simultaneous cultures of blood, bone marrow, liver, and lymph node aspirates were also carried out for 13 of these 103 cases. ResultsBlood culture identified 47 (45. 6 %) cases and <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>culture</b> identified 85 (82. 5 %) cases. Faster recovery of Brucella spp was accomplished with the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>culture</b> (2. 8 ± 0. 7 days, p< 0. 05). When the results of cultures of blood and bone marrow were compared {{with each other in}} the 13 cases, it was found that bone marrow specimens could be sterile (six cases (46 %)) when bacteremia was present, but Brucella melitensis was detected in liver aspirate in all these six bacteremic cases. ConclusionsOur data indicate that it is worthwhile practicing <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>culture</b> by conventional biphasic technique for the definitive and rapid diagnosis of brucellosis; this is particularly the case in developing countries where diagnostic facilities by advanced technologies such as automated culture systems with PCR are not available. Bone marrow culturing would be a better gold standard in areas where antibiotic pretreatment is common. Also, adopting the practice of culturing liver/lymph node fluids may enhance bacterial isolation and aid in the establishment of a diagnosis of brucellosis in cases for whom blood and bone marrow cultures are negative...|$|E

The effects of persistent CMV infection on hematopoiesis thus were examined using BALB/c mice at 4 weeks postinfection with 0. 2 LD 50 of murine CMV (MCMV) infection as a persistent infection model. The parameters of constitutive hematopoiesis of MCMV persistently infected mice were completely identical to those of the control. However, the inductive hematopoiesis, examined by the autologous marrow reconstitution after 5 -fluorouracil administration, was significantly impaired in the MCMV persistently infected mice (P< 0. 05). In a colony-forming unit-spleen assay and a long-term <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>culture</b> system, a decreased capacity of bone marrow stromal cells to support hematopoiesis was observed in the MCMV-infected mice in comparison with the controls. The existence of MCMV DNA in the adherent cells of long-term <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>culture</b> from the MCMV-infected mice were confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction but not in the nonadherent cells. Furthermore, the increased expression level of tumor necrosis factor-α by stromal cells was also observed by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.

Because none of the patients had illnesses apparently due to M. avium complex, the isolates were unexpected and unexplained. Six of the seven patients had other acute or chronic infectious processes, occurring alone or superimposed on a preexisting disease. These patients were therefore unusual, because nontuberculous mycobacteria have previously been obtained from <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>cultures</b> exclusively in patients who had either disseminated or pleuropulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteriosis. The isolation of M. avium complex from the reticuloendothelial tissue of these seven patients may reflect an asymptomatic infection or alternatively may lack significance. Either premise can only be judged by continued careful evaluation of similar findings...|$|R
40|$|In {{a case of}} quinine-induced {{agranulocytosis}} <b>marrow</b> <b>culture</b> studies {{confirmed the}} inhibitory effect on the patient's cells of equivalent therapeutic plasma concentrations of quinine. Similar concentrations {{had no effect on}} normal marrow cells. Quinidine, the stereoisomer of quinine, had no effect on either cells from the patient or normal cells. The results encourage the use of in-vitro <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>cultures</b> for identifying drugs responsible for agranulocytosis...|$|R
40|$|A case of Lactobacillus {{aortic valve}} {{endocarditis}} in a 53 -year-old immunocompetent patient with past history of rheumatic fever is reported. Clinical symptoms began after a dental extraction and the patient's diet included several yogurts per day. Blood, <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>cultures</b> and the replaced aortic valve were positive for Lactobacillus. The clinical isolate {{was identified as}} Lactobacillus casei by 16 S rDNA sequencing...|$|R
