5|$|The Sun has an {{apparent}} magnitude of −26.7, but its absolute magnitude is only +4.83. Sirius, the <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> {{in the night}} sky as seen from Earth, is approximately 23 times more luminous than the Sun, while Canopus, the second <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> {{in the night sky}} with an absolute magnitude of −5.53, is approximately 14,000 times more luminous than the Sun. Despite Canopus being vastly more luminous than Sirius, however, Sirius appears brighter than Canopus. This is because Sirius is merely 8.6 light-years from the Earth, while Canopus is much farther away at a distance of 310 light-years.|$|E

5|$|Circinus is a faint constellation, {{with only}} one star {{brighter}} than fourth magnitude. Alpha Circini, a white main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 3.19, is 54light-years away and 4° south of Alpha Centauri. Not only the <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> in the constellation, {{it is also the}} brightest example of a rapidly oscillating Ap (RoAp) star in the night sky. It has the unusual spectral type A7Vp SrCrE, showing increased emissions of strontium, chromium and europium. Stars of this type have oddly localised magnetic fields and are slightly variable. Alpha Circini forms a binary star system with an orange dwarf companion of spectral type K5 and magnitude 8.5, which with a separation of 5.7arcseconds is only discernible with a telescope. The distance between the two stars is 260AU and they take 2600years to rotate around a common centre of gravity. The second <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> is Beta Circini, a white main sequence star of spectral type A3Va and a magnitude of 4.07, about 100light-years away. It has around 1.8times the diameter of the Sun.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION The <b>brightest</b> <b>stars</b> in galaxies {{have been}} used as {{distance}} indicators since Hubble(1936). However, the accuracy of the <b>brightest</b> <b>stars</b> for distance estimates has been controversial. Recently, Rozanski and RowanRobinson (1994) argued large errors in the distance determination : 0. 58 mag and 0. 90 mag, respectively, for the <b>brightest</b> red <b>stars</b> and the <b>brightest</b> blue <b>stars,</b> while Karachentsev and Tikhonov(1994) suggested much smaller errors in the distance determination : 0. 37 mag for the <b>brightest</b> red <b>stars</b> and 0. 46 mag for the <b>brightest</b> blue <b>stars.</b> The reasons for these conflicting results are not yet known. We have investigated the accuracy of this method using a sample of 17 galaxies(LMC, SMC, NGC 6822, IC 1613, M 31, IC 10, M 33, WLM, NGC 3109, Sextans B, Sextans A, NGC 300, LeoA, NGC 2403, M 81, IC 4182, M 101) for which Cepheid distances are known and reliable photometry of the <b>brightest</b> <b>stars</b> are available (Figure 1).

5|$|Its <b>brightest</b> <b>star,</b> Capella, is {{an unusual}} {{multiple}} star system among the brightest stars in the night sky. Beta Aurigae is an interesting variable star in the constellation; Epsilon Aurigae, a nearby eclipsing binary with an unusually long period, has been studied intensively. Because of its position near the winter Milky Way, Auriga has many bright open clusters in its borders, including M36, M37, and M38, popular targets for amateur astronomers. In addition, it has one prominent nebula, the Flaming Star Nebula, associated with the variable star AE Aurigae.|$|E
5|$|Sirius appears bright {{because of}} its {{intrinsic}} luminosity and its proximity to Earth. At a distance of 2.6 parsecs (8.6 ly), {{as determined by the}} Hipparcos astrometry satellite, the Sirius system is one of Earth's near neighbours. Sirius is gradually moving closer to the Solar System, so it will slightly increase in brightness over the next 60,000 years. After that time its distance will begin to increase and it will become fainter, but it will continue to be the <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> in the Earth's night sky for the next 210,000 years.|$|E

5|$|The <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> in {{the night}} sky, Sirius is {{recorded}} in the earliest astronomical records.

Its displacement from the ecliptic causes this heliacal rising to be remarkably regular compared to other stars, with a period of almost exactly 365.25 days holding it constant relative to the solar year. This occurs at Cairo on 19July (Julian), placing it just prior to the summer solstice and the onset of the annual flooding of the Nile during antiquity.|$|E
