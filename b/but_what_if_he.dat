2500|$|In 1969, Haggard {{released}} [...] "Okie From Muskogee," [...] with lyrics ostensibly {{reflecting the}} singer's {{pride in being}} from Middle America where people are conventionally patriotic, don't smoke marijuana, don't take LSD, don't protest by burning draft cards or otherwise challenge authority. In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values. In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a [...] "documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time." [...] However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the Bob Edwards Show, he said, [...] "I wrote it when I recently {{got out of the}} joint. I knew {{what it was like to}} lose my freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters. They didn't know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. I thought how my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt." [...] In the country music documentary series Lost Highway, he elaborated: [...] "My dad passed away when I was nine, and I don't know if you've ever thought about somebody you've lost and you say, 'I wonder what so-and-so would think about this?' I was drivin' on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said '19 Miles to Muskogee.' Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as 'back home.' So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought, 'I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins.... I understood 'em, I got along with it, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin' in the center of the country sayin', 'What is goin' on on these campuses?'" [...] In the American Masters documentary about him, he said, [...] "That's how I got into it with the hippies.... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, 'You sons of bitches, you've never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin' about things, protesting about a war that they didn't know any more about than I did. They weren't over there fightin' that war any more than I was." ...|$|E

He was the future head of the family, and already a Bachelor of Arts.

Did he know it? or was the news now being brought by this messenger whom he, Hurlstone, had supplanted? If so, when and how had Perkins received the intelligence that brought him to Todos Santos? The young man could scarcely repress a bitter smile as he remembered the accepted idea of Todos Santos' inviolability--that inaccessible port that had within six weeks secretly summoned Perkins to its assistance!

60|$|But I see you put no {{difference}} between an open breach of the law, and a forbearing that which to him is doubtful. But I will suppose a case: There is a man wants light in baptism, yet by his neighbour is pressed to it: he saith he seeth it not to be his duty; the other saith, <b>he</b> sins <b>if</b> <b>he</b> doth it not: now seeing 'whatsoever is not of faith is sin' (Rom 14:23); what should this man do? If you say, let him use the means: I say so too. <b>But</b> <b>what,</b> <b>if</b> when <b>he</b> hath used it, he still continueth dark about it; what will you advise him now? If you bid him wait, do you not encourage him to live in sin, as much as I do? Nay, and seeing you will not let him for want of light in that, obey God in other his institutions; <b>what</b> is it <b>but</b> to say, Seeing you live for want {{of light in the}} neglect of baptism, we will make you, while you continue so, live, though quite against your light, in the breach of all the rest.

6000|$|But then, curiously enough, {{there came}} over him a vague dread of {{possible}} evil, such {{as he had}} never felt before. He had been trying for years to raise himself above the power of fortune; and he had succeeded ill enough: {{but he had never}} lost heart. Robbed, shipwrecked, lost in deserts, cheated at cards, shot in revolutions, begging his bread, he had always been the same unconquerable light-hearted Tom, whose motto was, [...] "Fall light, and don't whimper: better luck next round." [...] <b>But</b> now, <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> played his last court-card, and Fortune, out of her close-hidden hand, laid down a trump thereon with quiet sneering smile? And she would! He knew, somehow, that he should not thrive. His children would die of the measles, his horses break their knees, his plate be stolen, his house catch fire, and Mark Armsworth die insolvent. What a fool he was, to fancy such nonsense! Here he had been slaving all his life to keep his father: and now he could keep him; why, he would be justified, right, a good son, in doing the thing. How hard, how unjust of those upper Powers in which he believed so vaguely, to forbid his doing it! ...|$|R
60|$|Ans. If he doth, God {{must give}} it him; I mean {{to know his}} duty as a church member. Now I will add, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> that can give a shilling, giveth nothing? I suppose all that the church can do in that case, is but to warn, to exhort, and charge him, and to shew him his duty: and if he neglect, to shew him, that 'He which soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly' (2 Cor 9:6). But to cut a man off for this, as you forwardly urge, would argue that church, at least I think so, a little too bold with so high and weighty a censure. I plead not here for the churl, but seek to allay your heat: and should it be granted that such deserve as you would have it, this makes no matter to the case in hand. Now whereas you suggest, 'That moral evils are but sins against men,' you are too much unadvised: the moral evil, as you call it, whether you respect the breach of {{the first or second}} table, is first and {{immediately}} a sin against God; and more insufferable, yea and damnable, than for a man for want of light to forbear either baptism or the Lord's Supper.|$|E
60|$|Emily Hotspur blushed {{up to her}} brows, and {{her cheeks}} and {{forehead}} were suffused with blood; but her mouth was set as firm as a rock, and then came that curl over her eye which her father had so dearly loved {{when she was a}} child, but which was now held by him to be so dangerous. She {{was not going to be}} talked out of her love in that way. Of course there had been things,--were things of which she knew nothing and desired to know nothing. Though she herself was as pure as the driven snow, she did not require to be told that there were impurities in the world. If it was meant to be insinuated that he was untrue to her, she simply disbelieved it. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were? His untruth would not justify hers. And untruth was impossible to her. She loved him, and had told him so. Let him be ever so false, it was for her to bring him back to truth or to spend herself in the endeavour. Her father did not understand her at all when he talked to her after this fashion. But she said nothing. Her father was alluding to a matter on which she could say nothing.|$|E
60|$|Excellent! O, by {{all means}} {{preserve}} for {{him the benefit of}} his rightful heir-loom, the regal sceptre; only lay it about his shoulders, till he promises to handle it, as he ought! <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> breaks his promise and your head? or what if he will not promise? How much honester would it be to say, that extreme cases are 'ipso nomine' not generalizable, --therefore not the subjects of a law, which is the conclusion 'per genus singuli in genere inclusi'. Every extreme case must be judged by and for itself under all the peculiar circumstances. Now as these are not foreknowable, the case itself cannot be predeterminable. Harmodius and Aristogiton did not justify Brutus and Cassius: but neither do Brutus and Cassius criminate Harmodius and Aristogiton. The rule applies till an extreme case occurs; and how can this be proved? I answer, the only proof is success and good event; for these afford the best presumption, first, of the extremity, and secondly, of its remediable nature--the two elements of its justification. To every individual it is forbidden. He who attempts it, therefore, must do so on the presumption that the will of the nation is in his will: whether he is mad or in his senses, the event can alone determine.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2009 Miami New Times article, Roberts' {{lifestyle}} when {{he lived}} in Hollywood, Florida was described as follows: Former mega-smuggler Jon Roberts, who flooded Miami with $2 billion worth of cocaine in the '80s, naps away his days in a quiet lakefront Hollywood home. <b>But</b> soon, <b>if</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> says is true, a book, a high-octane movie, and videogame contracts will again make him a player.

There was now a ghastly look of horrible excitement on his face, while his teeth-grinding performances became more frequent and the slimy froth dropped continually from {{the corners of his mouth}} on to his bosom. I dared not look at the knife, because a terrible impulse to wrest it out of his hands kept rising in me. It was almost too strong to be overcome, yet I knew that even the slightest attempt to escape would be fatal to me; for the fellow was evidently thirsty for my blood and only wanted an excuse to run me through. <b>But</b> <b>what,</b> I thought, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were to grow tired of waiting, and, carried away by his murderous instincts, to plunge his weapon into me? In that case I should die like a dog, without having availed myself of my one chance of escape through over-caution. These thoughts were maddening, still through it all I laboured to observe an outwardly calm demeanour.|$|R
6000|$|Conclusion Seventh. Another {{conclusion}} that followeth from these words is this, namely, That God is able, {{as well as}} willing, to secure the souls of his suffering saints, and to save them from the evil of all their trials, be they never so many, divers, or terrible. [...] "Let him commit the keeping of his soul to God," [...] <b>but</b> to <b>what</b> boot, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> be not able {{to keep it in}} his hand, and from the power of him that seeks the soul to destroy it? But [...] "my Father which gave them me," [...] saith Christ, [...] "is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand" [...] (John 10:29). So then there can be no sorrow, affliction, or misery invented, by which the devil may so strongly prevail, as thereby to pluck the soul out of the hand of him who has received it, to keep it from falling, and perishing thereby. The text therefore supposeth a sufficiency of power in God to support, and a sufficiency of comfort and goodness to embolden the soul to endure for him: let Satan break out, and his instruments too, to the greatest degree of their rage and cruelty.|$|R
6000|$|All these considerations, and {{manifold}} {{more connected}} with them--innumerable considerations, resulting from {{observation of the}} world at this moment--have led many people to doubt of the salutary effect of vocal education altogether. I {{do not mean to}} say it should be entirely excluded; but I look to something that will take hold of the matter much more closely, and not allow it slip out of our fingers, and remain worse than it was. For if a good speaker--an eloquent speaker--is not speaking the truth, is there a more horrid kind of object in creation? (Loud cheers.)

But would the law allow itself to be used readily for this purpose? She, too, could understand that {{the feeling of the}} community would be against her, and that in such a case the law might allow itself to become slow, lethargic, and perhaps inoperative, yielding to the popular feeling. She saw the points which were strong against her as clearly as William and Robert Bolton had seen those which were strong on their side. But----!
