5|$|Phidias, who {{had been}} in charge of all {{building}} projects, was first accused of embezzling gold meant for the statue of Athena and then of impiety, <b>because,</b> <b>when</b> he wrought the battle of the Amazons on the shield of Athena, he carved out a figure that suggested himself as a bald old man, and also inserted a very fine likeness of Pericles fighting with an Amazon.|$|E
5|$|Entanglement {{can result}} in {{mortality}} <b>because</b> <b>when</b> the seals get trapped in marine debris such as fishing nets they cannot maneuver or reach the surface to breathe. Marine fisheries can potentially interact with monk seals via direct and indirect relationships. Directly the seal can become snared by fishing equipment, entangled in discarded debris, and even feed on fish refuse.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rewarded with house points for their heroic performances, giving Gryffindor enough points to win the House Cup.|$|E
5|$|Indigenous {{people of}} the Dakelh and Tsilhqot'in tribes have {{inhabited}} the area for hundreds of years. In pre-contact times, these people lived a nomadic lifestyle. They did not build permanent structures in which to live, as they moved from region to region to find food and resources. Animals such as caribou, martin, moose and caribou were hunted and trapped by the Dakelh and Tsilhqot'in tribes. In summer, these people gathered roots, plants and a volcanic glass called obsidian. Anahim obsidian was traded widely throughout the Interior {{and up and down}} the Coast from the community of Bella Coola. Arrowheads and knives were made from obsidian <b>because</b> <b>when</b> it breaks with a characteristic conchoidal fracture, it creates very sharp edges. A modified form of this lifestyle is practiced by some indigenous people to this day.|$|E
5|$|Interferometry {{makes use}} of the {{principle}} of superposition to combine waves {{in a way that will}} cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves. This works <b>because</b> <b>when</b> two waves with the same frequency combine, the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are out of phase will undergo destructive interference. Waves which are not completely in phase nor completely out of phase will have an intermediate intensity pattern, which can be used to determine their relative phase difference. Most interferometers use light or some other form of electromagnetic wave.|$|E

He married Minnie Dockterman in 1952 (1912–99). He left three daughters, two; Gro (1932-) and Turid (1938-) by his first wife and one; Karen (1952) by the second wife.

5|$|Ophelia {{has also}} been defended by feminist critics, most notably Elaine Showalter. Ophelia is {{surrounded}} by powerful men: her father, brother, and Hamlet. All three disappear: Laertes leaves, Hamlet abandons her, and Polonius dies. Conventional theories had argued that without these three powerful men making decisions for her, Ophelia is driven into madness. Feminist theorists argue that she goes mad with guilt <b>because,</b> <b>when</b> Hamlet kills her father, he has fulfilled her sexual desire to have Hamlet kill her father {{so they can be}} together. Showalter points out that Ophelia has become the symbol of the distraught and hysterical woman in modern culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{high-pressure}} injection {{leads to}} a quick fill of the die, which is required so the entire cavity fills before {{any part of the}} casting solidifies. In this way, discontinuities are avoided, even if the shape requires difficult-to-fill thin sections. This creates the problem of air entrapment, <b>because</b> <b>when</b> the mold is filled quickly there is little time for the air to escape. This problem is minimized by including vents along the parting lines, however, even in a highly refined process there will still be some porosity {{in the center of the}} casting.|$|E

5|$|With ample {{current density}} and ionization, this forms a {{luminous}} electric arc (a continuous electric discharge similar to lightning) between the electrodes. Electrical resistance along the continuous electric arc creates heat, which dissociates more gas molecules and ionizes the resulting atoms (where degree of ionization {{is determined by}} temperature), and as per the sequence: solid-liquid-gas-plasma, the gas is gradually turned into a thermal plasma. A thermal plasma is in thermal equilibrium, {{which is to say}} that the temperature is relatively homogeneous throughout the heavy particles (i.e. atoms, molecules and ions) and electrons. This is so <b>because</b> <b>when</b> thermal plasmas are generated, electrical energy is given to electrons, which, due to their great mobility and large numbers, are able to disperse it rapidly and by elastic collision (without energy loss) to the heavy particles.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, <b>because</b> <b>when</b> you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{homicide}} department is requiring all the detectives to take sensitivity training with therapist Carry Westin (Jennifer Mendenhall). While {{most of them}} have positive experiences with her, Bolander (Ned Beatty) flatly refuses to participate and repeatedly avoids their scheduled sessions. When Gee (Yaphet Kotto) tells Bolander he will be suspended without pay if he does not meet with her, Bolander chooses the suspension, but later reconsiders after his partner Munch (Richard Belzer) harasses him at the bar until he changes his mind. When they finally meet, Bolander explains he does not trust therapists <b>because</b> <b>when</b> going through marriage counseling with his ex-wife, the therapist actively encouraged her to leave Bolander. He feels he was cheated out of $7,000 in therapy bills, but Westin explains his anger is not from the money, but from feelings of betrayal by his ex-wife. Bolander is ultimately impressed by Westin and even decides to ask her on a date, but she strongly hints she is a lesbian.|$|E
5|$|Saint Catherine's Monastery still {{maintains}} {{the importance of}} a letter, handwritten in 1844 with an original signature of Tischendorf confirming that he borrowed those leaves. However, recently published documents, including a deed of gift dated 11 September 1868 and signed by Archbishop Kallistratos and the monks of the monastery, indicate that the manuscript was acquired entirely legitimately. This deed, which agrees with a report by Kurt Aland on the matter, has now been published. Unfortunately this development is not widely known in the English-speaking world, as only German- and Russian-language media reported on it in 2009. Doubts as to the legality of the gift arose <b>because</b> <b>when</b> Tischendorf originally removed the manuscript from Saint Catherine's Monastery in September 1859, the monastery was without an archbishop, so that even though the intention to present the manuscript to the Tsar had been expressed, no legal gift could be made at the time. Resolution of the matter was delayed through the turbulent reign of Archbishop Cyril (consecrated 7 December 1859, deposed 24 August 1866), and the situation only formalised after the restoration of peace.|$|E
