500|$|While {{the single}} {{did not receive}} {{significant}} radio play in the US, MTV placed its video on high rotation. The version most often shown was edited to remove the mermaids' bare breasts. Greenwood said, [...] "we would've understood {{if they had a}} problem with some guy chopping his arms and legs off, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> a woman's breasts! And mermaids as well! It's fucked up." [...] MTV Europe played the video uncut for two weeks because the channel's official censor was ill and unable to work; after that time the channel ran the cut version of the video. A later US version of the video saw the mermaids wear bathing suits, while the uncut version was later compiled along with other Radiohead videos on the DVD and home video release 7 Television Commercials and [...]|$|E
500|$|Vocalist Lachman joined The Mercy Clinic, which aided {{the grieving}} process. He commented, [...] "you {{have to get}} back on the horse. You could easily let a decade go by and not do anything. I'm happy to have walked away with my life after the {{situation}} I was thrown into. <b>But,</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> what do you do? I'm a musician. I'm going to make music. What Dime would have told me was, 'You make music, motherfucker. Get back on it. Do what you do.' So, that's what I did." [...] Before the shooting, Phil Anselmo made the statement [...] "Dimebag deserves to be severely beaten" [...] in the December 2004 edition of Metal Hammer. He denied making the comments and apologized, although Abbott requested Metal Hammer to provide the audio tapes to prove the authenticity of what Anselmo said. Abbott found the quote authentic and referred to him as the [...] "master of lies".|$|E
2500|$|Asked about {{a release}} {{date for the}} album in an {{interview}} with WGRD in April, McKinnon said that [...] "there's a date we've [...] tossed around in the last week, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> we haven't really set anything in stone." [...] Asked in the same interview if Common Courtesy was going to be released on Victory, he replied that the band were [...] "not sure", and that the lawsuit was still being settled.|$|E

2500|$|Theo {{referred}} to these pictorial {{elements in a}} letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: [...] "I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [...] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things." [...] Vincent responded in early November, [...] "Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing. If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it. But am inclined to believe {{that in the long run}} you'd get used to it." [...] And later in the same letter, he wrote, [...] "I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses." ...|$|E

I agreed as you was to speak, Mr. Tyrrwhit; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>means</b> to be spoken up for; and {{if no one else}} can do it, I can do it myself.

6000|$|... "Auntie, I {{know now}} it was <b>mean,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>mean</b> to be <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> didn't, honest. And besides, I didn't come over here to laugh at you that night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah,' said Sam, 'I should ha' s'posed that; <b>but</b> what <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> is, {{should you}} like a drop of anythin' as'd warm you? <b>but</b> <b>I</b> s'pose you never was cold, with all them elastic fixtures, was you?' ...|$|R
