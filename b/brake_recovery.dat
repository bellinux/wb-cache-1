40|$|The {{three-wheeled}} motor taxi, often termed as “auto rickshaw ” is {{very popular}} in India and serves as the most affordable means of transportation to the local people. Due to its small size, it is well suited for the narrow crowded streets in Indian cities. One of the main concerns of this vehicle has been its large emissions of green house gases and other toxic particulates, thereby causing severe air pollution. This paper presents a survey of relevant literature {{on the need for}} a low-cost Parallel Electric Hybrid Three-Wheeled Motor Taxi or Parallel Electric Hybrid Rickshaw (PEHR). Extensive simulation studies are carried out on a Bajaj RE auto rickshaw equipped with a two stroke engine on the modified Indian Driving Cycle by making it electric hybrid capable of managing its regenerative braking energy.

40|$|Millions {{of hybrid}} cars are already running on our roads {{with the purpose}} of {{reducing}} fossil fuel dependence. One of their main advantages is the recovery of wasted energy, namely by <b>brake</b> <b>recovery.</b> However, there are other sources of wasted energy in a car powered by an internal combustion engine, such as the heat lost through the cooling system, lubrication system (oil coolers) and in the exhaust system. These energies can be recuperated by the use of thermoelectric generators (TEG) based on the Seebeck effect, which transform heat directly into electricity To recover the energy from the hot (up to more than 700 ºC) exhaust gases it is possible to use controlled heat transfer, but this would limit the heat transfer potential at partial loads, as commercialy available TEG are limited by their maximum allowable temperature (~ 250 ºC). Therefore Heat Pipes were used as an alternative heat transfer mean, so {{it would be possible to}} retain the heat transfer potential, while controlling the maximum temperature at a reasonable level. This is the method to recover the exhaust heat presented in this work. Numerical simulations were performed to assess the potential for this design, involving internal combustion engine simulation, thermoelectric generators simulation and heat transfer modelling. Additionally, the use of variable conductance heat pipes (VCHP) is discussed, as a means of achieving TEG module maximum temperature limitation.
