40|$|A {{synthetic}} pheromone of {{the western}} <b>pine</b> shoot <b>borer,</b> Eucosma sonomana Kearfott, has been used successfully as a 'mating disrupter in northern Idaho and western Montana since 1984. Infestation levels in treated ponderosa pine plantations declined {{from an average of}} 28 percent infested in 1983 to 5. 5 percent by 1986. At the same time, infestation levels in the untreated check areas increased from an average of 24 percent to 30 percent from 1983 to 1986...|$|R
40|$|Many lessons {{have been}} learned during {{reforestation}} of large wildfires and clearcuts in interior Northern California, {{a region of}} low rainfall and summer drought typical of a Mediterranean climate. Challenges appeared from time of establishment right up to commercial thinning. Establishment issues included procurement of improved seed, site preparation, soil mitigation, seedling performance, season of planting, and timing of vegetation management. Important decisions also {{had to be made}} with regard to mechanical vs. hand pre-commercial thinning (PCT), achieving a proper balance between reducing fire risk and compacting the soil, and prescribing spacing guidelines for thinning operations. On some sites damage from Eucosma sonomana (Kearfott) (western <b>pine</b> shoot <b>borer)</b> was a factor...|$|R
40|$|Two blends (Natural and Phillips) of {{the western}} <b>pine</b> shoot <b>borer</b> pheromone, {{formulated}} as Hercon Luretape, were applied to six ponderosa pine plantations in northern Idaho and western Montana in 1984. The treatment was approximately 21. 6 grams of pheromone per hectare. Significant reductions in damage have occurred in all treated plantations. Damage has been reduced most in plantations that are not surrounded by pine stands which provide a reservoir of moths that can reinvade treated areas. The best results to date have been a reduction of infested terminals from 50. 9 to 1. 6 percent after 2 years of treatment. Population trends in nearby check areas were either static or increasing. Treatment effects of both the Natural and Phillips formulations were {{significantly different from the}} control at the 99 percent level. However, these treatments were not different from each other...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Infestations of {{the western}} <b>pine</b> shoot <b>borer</b> (Eucosma sonomana Kearfott) in young stands of ponderosa pine (Pinusponderosa Lawson), were {{surveyed}} on the Deschutes National Forest. Elevation, slope, aspect, tree height, tree diameter, number of shoots in the terminal whorl, stand density, stand age and plant association for each stand were used in general multiple regression and logistic regression analyses to predict the percentage of infested terminal shoots. Using general multiple regression, taking the arcsin(square root(proportion of infested trees)), the models that were selected as the best predictors included (1) diameter, trees/hectare and elevation (R 2 = 0. 62) and (2) number of shoots in the terminal whorl and stand age (R 2 = 0. 62). Using logistic regression, the best model included number of shoots in the terminal whorl and stand age. Values for these stand characteristics {{can be used with}} the appropriate equation to estimate the percentage of terminal whorls damaged by shoot borer in a given stand. A companion study performed in six progeny test sites on the Ochoco National Forest found significant differences in shoot borer infestations among 29 ponderosa pine families (P-value = 0. 001, R 2 =O. 62) ...|$|R
40|$|The blue <b>pine</b> wood <b>borer</b> (Phaenops cyanea) and {{the black}} pine sawyer beetle (Monochamus galloprovincialis) (Fig. 1) both are pests of the white pine (Pinus silvestris) and other Pinus species. Both insects have nearly the same demands {{regarding}} their breeding site. Larval development requires a fresh, unwilted inner bark. An infestation occurs on freshly cut trees or on trees suffering from stress (e. g. after dry seasons, loss of needles caused by feeding caterpillars or damage by forest fires). Phaenops cyanea detects susceptible pines by their volatile emissions (SCHÜTZ et al. 2004) {{and is able to}} infest the trees already at a low stress level. During feeding the larvae avoid the resin ducts of the tree and thus evade the oleoresin defence. The beetle is endemic in Europe and – under favourable climatic conditions – can cause substantial damage to pine forests. It is the most significant bark-breeding beetle of white pine in the lowlands of north-eastern Germany. Monochamus galloprovincialis is found in Europe and northern Africa. The larvae tend to a more copious feeding which makes them more susceptible to the oleoresin defence of the tree. Thus, M. galloprovincialis prefers trees that are weakened by a higher degree of stress. The economic damage caused by feeding of thebeetle is low. However, the beetle has gained a special attention of forest scientists because of its association with the nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus which is causing the pine wilt disease (PWD) in Pinus. The only outbreak of the PWD within Europe is limited to an area of 258. 000 ha in Portugal. (MOTA et al. 1999). Die Forstschädlinge Phaenops cyanea (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) und Monochamus galloprovincialis (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) befallen beide Kiefern (Pinus sylvestris), die geschwächt sind, z. B. durch Wasser-Stress. Die Larven von P. cyanea entwickeln sich in oder unter der Rinde, während Larven von M. galloprovincialis nach einem Fraß im Kambium des befallenen Baumes auch tief in das Holz eindringen. P. cyanea befällt bereits Bäume, die nur einem geringen Stress ausgesetzt waren, während M. galloprovincialis Bäume bevorzugt, die erheblich geschwächt oder bereits tot sind. Die vorliegende Studie soll anhand elektrophysiologischer Experimente untersuchen, welchen olfaktorischen Hinweisen die beiden Insekten bei ihrer Suche nach einem geeigneten Eiablageplatz folgen. Duftstoffe von Pinus sylvestris wurden auf Aktivkohle gesammelt und mit Gaschromatographie, Massenspektroskopie und Elektroantennographie untersucht (GC-MS/ EAD). Die stärksten Signale von P. cyanea traten im Retentionsindex-Bereich von 936 (&# 945;-Pinen) bis 1200 auf, wobei insbesondere bizyklische Terpene und Terpenoide wie &# 945;-Pinen, &# 946;-Pinen, 1, 8 -Cineol und trans- Verbenol detektiert wurden. M. galloprovincialis reagierte auf einen weiteren Bereich von Stoffen, ebenfalls beginnend mit &# 945;-Pinen, bis hin zu Stoffen mit einem Retentionsindex von ca. 1300. Es scheint eine spezifische Empfindlichkeit für monozyklische und azyklische Terpene und Terpenoide vorzuliegen, insbesondere für &# 947;-Terpinen, Terpinolen, &# 946;-Myrcen und p-Cymen...|$|R
