50|$|Drilling {{through the}} brittle ice zone {{typically}} results in poorer quality core samples {{than for the}} rest of the core. Some steps can be taken to alleviate the problem. Liners can be placed inside the drill barrel to enclose the core before it is brought to the surface, but this makes it difficult to clean drilling fluid from the core. In mineral drilling, equipment is available to bring core samples to the surface at <b>bottom-hole</b> pressure, but this requires machinery that is cost-prohibitive for ice cores given the inaccessible locations of most drilling sites. Keeping the core processing facilities at very low temperatures to limit the thermal shock to the core helps reduce breakage. Cores are susceptible to breaking when being cut at the surface, so another approach is to break the cores to 1 m lengths in the hole, to avoid the need for surface cutting at the lower pressure. Extruding the core into a net as it is recovered from the drill barrel helps keep the core together if it shatters at the surface. Brittle cores are also often allowed to rest in storage at the drill site for some time, for up to a full year between drilling seasons, in order to let the ice gradually relax.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Practically, the {{distribution}} and variation of the <b>bottom-hole</b> hydraulic energy has significant influence on drilling rate, and it’s helpful to induce <b>bottom-hole</b> hydraulic pulse to improve the rock breaking and drilling efficiency. The analysis of <b>bottom-hole</b> rock stress condition and cuttings start-up mechanism indicates that, <b>bottom-hole</b> hydraulic pulsation can decrease the bottom hole pressure, reduce the fracture strength of rock, and strengthen <b>bottom-hole</b> purification, thus improve the efficiency of rock breaking and drilling. The higher the pulsation value is, the more effective of the acceleration of the drilling rate, while well depth increases, the acceleration effect diminishes gradually. Simulation of jet flow field drilled by 3 -nozzle 3 -cone bit, combined with field application, verify the mechanism that <b>bottom-hole</b> hydraulic pulsation could improve ROP.

30|$|At San Vito (Mofete {{geothermal}} field), a {{well was}} drilled at 6 ′′ to 3045  m. The well {{had to be}} side tracked two times due to loss of the <b>bottom-hole</b> assembly (BHA) downhole. During drilling of the first lateral, circulation was interrupted leading to gelling and coagulation of the drilling mud around the BHA. Trying to re-establish circulation by perforating the drill string failed as the explosive charge decomposed at elevated <b>bottom-hole</b> temperatures. In the second lateral, measurements with a zinc melting tablet indicated a <b>bottom-hole</b> temperature in excess of 419  °C following a 1 -week shut-in period (Baron and Ungemach 1981; Fournier 1991).

40|$|AbstractThe {{number of}} gas {{injection}} or exploitation projects is on fast increase with growing energy needs and environmental problems. Of these projects, the calculation {{and the control}} of wellhead pressure or <b>bottom-hole</b> pressure in wellbores are usually key steps. However, methods used to predict wellhead and <b>bottom-hole</b> pressure are multifarious, making the program writing and practical application inconvenient. In this study, a unified formula derived from the differential equations of one-dimensional steady pipe flow and applicable in both injection wells and production wells was presented for calculation of both wellhead pressure and <b>bottom-hole</b> pressure. The recalculation with a traditional numerical method of the same equations corroborated well {{the accuracy of the}} unified formula, and the positive- reverse checking calculation verified its reliability. Basic data from Shenhua CCS project were used for studying the influence of injected gas temperature, geothermal gradient and flow rate on wellbore pressure by applying the unified formula.

30|$|To {{investigate}} comprehensively {{the application}} of this approach, three case studies in oil and gas reservoirs are considered. Case 1 is an example design data from application well test software; case 2 is a field data from offshore Nigeria, while case 3 is a synthetic data generated from numerical model built with commercial simulator. The simulator keywords were local refinement <b>bottom-hole</b> pressure, LBPR; local refinement oil density, LDENO; local refinement water density, LDENW; local refinement gas density, LDENG; and well <b>bottom-hole</b> pressure, BHP, were outputs to obtain the density and pressure change around the well {{and as far as}} the perturbation could extend.|$|E

30|$|The {{direct output}} of {{numerical}} simulation {{is the time}} history of pressure at the bottom hole, but what is measured in engineering performance usually is the wellhead pressure on the ground.

Therefore, the wellhead pressure evolution measured on ground can be transformed to the corresponding <b>bottom-hole</b> pressure, by considering the above factors, and then compared to the simulation obtained <b>bottom-hole</b> pressure.|$|E

30|$|One of the {{operational}} tools for evaluating performance of wells in petroleum engineering is IPR curve. IPR for a well {{is the relationship}} between flow rate of the well (Q) and flowing pressure of the well or <b>bottom-hole</b> pressure (Pwf) at certain average reservoir pressure (Pr). Study of behavior and changes in IPR is essential in petroleum engineering. Because, these curves are used for consideration of different operating conditions, specification of optimum production rate and also design of production and artificial lift equipment (Gilbert 1954; Golan and Whitson 1991). Some numerical/analytical models with special assumption have been developed based on Darcy’s equation for calculation of IPR curve mostly in oil or dry gas wells (Al-Attar and AL-Zuhair 2008; Brar and Aziz 1978; Chase and Alkandari 1993; Evinger and Muskat 1942; Fetkovich 1973; Mishra and Caudle 1984; Vogel 1968). Nevertheless, many investigators generalized these numerical / analytical models for calculation of IPR curves in gas condensate wells considering two-phase flow in near wellbore region (Al-Shawaf et al. 2014; Fevang and Whitson 1996; O’Dell 1967; Orodu et al. 2012). However, these models are insufficient to account for condensate accumulation and complex flow behavior in this region (Jokhio and Tiab 2002; Sakhaei et al. 2017). Actual conditions of near wellbore area in gas condensate reservoirs such as effect of high flow rate, high capillary number, non-Darcy effects and reservoir heterogeneity are not considered in these models (Kumar et al. 2006). These assumptions can cause significant error in predicting performance of wells. Therefore, gas condensate reservoir performance may be predicted with high accuracy and less assumptions through numerical simulation of a radial, single-well and heterogeneous model with fine grid in near wellbore to consider all phenomena in this area. An example of IPR construction through reservoir simulation is given by Sakhaei et al. (Sakhaei et al. 2017). A similar approach was used in this study to generate data points to plot IPR curves by simulation. This approach includes (1) constructing a reservoir model, followed by running the model at several different <b>bottom-hole</b> pressures (well production with constant <b>bottom-hole</b> pressure), (2) continuous recording of gas production rate as a function of average reservoir pressure in each <b>bottom-hole</b> pressure and (3) running the model at each step until average reservoir pressure reaches to the <b>bottom-hole</b> pressure. Therefore, a series of <b>bottom-hole</b> pressure data will be obtained as function of gas production flow rate at different average reservoir pressures.|$|E
30|$|According to the {{explained}} {{procedure in}} Sect.  2.1, IPR curves were plotted and compered in four different average reservoir pressures (Pr) through compositional and modified black-oil simulation of single-layer reservoir model. These results are demonstrated in Fig.  4. It should be mentioned that only reservoir rock and fluid model were simplified and other specifications {{such as the}} number of grid blocks in the radial direction, well perforation, wellbore radius and reservoir pore volume were the same in all cases. Also, IPR curves were plotted by running reservoir model at similar <b>bottom-hole</b> pressures for both simulators. As observed from Fig.  4, the IPR curve moves downward by decreasing average reservoir pressure. In other words, for a specific <b>bottom-hole</b> pressure, well produces a lower rate at lower average reservoir pressure. Also, in defined average reservoir pressure, when the <b>bottom-hole</b> pressure becomes close to average reservoir pressure, flow rate decreases and becomes zero due to absence of any pressure drawdown. Maximum flow rate, i.e., absolute open flow (AOF) potential, happens when <b>bottom-hole</b> pressure tends to be zero. According to Fig.  4, for the target gas condensate reservoir, compositional and modified black-oil simulator have good agreement with each other in estimation of flow rate in various <b>bottom-hole</b> pressure. The relative errors of estimated IPR curves using these two simulators are reported in Table  6. These reported errors of less than 10 % show that selecting modified black-oil simulator instead of compositional gives good results with significantly lower runtime. So, the modified black-oil as an optimal simulator was utilized for running the reservoir model in other parts of this study. Also, results illustrated in Fig.  4 and Table  6 state that for average reservoir pressure above dew point pressure, the error between these two simulators is insignificant. This is due to small changes in reservoir fluid composition at pressures higher than dew point pressure with low rate of retrograde condensation.|$|E
