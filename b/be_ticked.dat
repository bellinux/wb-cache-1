2500|$|Twitching is a British {{term used}} to mean [...] "the pursuit of a {{previously}} located rare bird." [...] In North America it is more often called chasing, though the British usage is starting to catch on there, especially among younger birders. The term twitcher, sometimes misapplied as a synonym for birder, is reserved for those who travel long distances to see a rare bird that would then <b>be</b> <b>ticked,</b> or counted on a list. The term originated in the 1950s, when it {{was used for the}} nervous behaviour of Howard Medhurst, a British birdwatcher. Prior terms for those who chased rarities were pot-hunter, tally-hunter, or tick-hunter. The main goal of twitching is often to accumulate species on one's lists. Some birders engage in competition to accumulate the longest species list. The act of the pursuit itself is referred to as a twitch or a chase. A rare bird that stays put long enough for people to see it is twitchable or chaseable.|$|E

This study prospectively looks at how the process of community engagement under the Well London programme (a five-year health promotion programme which addresses physical activity, diet and mental wellbeing) was delivered in multiple deprived neighbourhoods, and how this process influenced the different stakeholders and the health promotion projects delivered. Methods: This study used a mixed method approach to examine the process, perceptions, impacts, incentives, barriers and challenges of community engagement. Data were collected through literature review, questionnaire surveys, participant observation, qualitative interviews and evidence from documentary sources...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to describe}} the content aspects of life skills within the most used English textbook in Banjarmasin and Yogyakarta focusing on (1) personal skill, (2) social skill, (3) academic skill, and (4) vocational skill. This was a descriptive qualitative study that was supported by quantitative data. The evaluation of the textbook used Krippendorf’s content analysis (2004 : 82) by grouping, sampling, coding, reducing, concluding, and reporting the result. The criteria used were from life skill contents (Depdiknas, 2009), developed from Pedoman Penilaian Buku Teks Pelajaran Bahasa Inggris by the Board of National Education Standard Team, the Ministry of National Education (2007). The data were collected through observation. The research was from April 2012 to April 2014. The validity used content validity and triangulation while the reliability used inter-coder reliability. The inter-coders were given the needed data that should <b>be</b> <b>ticked</b> then concluded and counted the mean so that the final conclusion was more objective. The result of the research shows as follows. All of the aspects of personal skill were contained in the book with frequency of each (100...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to draw {{attention}} to the hurdles which face academic researchers who simply want to get on with their job and learn about how marketing and related matters are conducted in business. You would think that the subject of competitiveness and how to improve their understanding of competitors would be a subject which would resonate with the UK manufacturing sector. It appears not. In the project reported here, just about every box that was possible to <b>be</b> <b>ticked,</b> was ticked. The people involved were all experienced researchers with good publication records. We thought we had got it all right, yet the response rate was dismal. In the debate which follows, I examine where we might have gone wrong, what we could have done differently and invite you to consider whether any of this would have made the slightest difference. It is a sad reflection on how difficult it is to obtain good quality primary data from firms these days. As academics, we are being told that our research has to have “impact” and be “relevant”. For this to happen we need to secure dialogue with the commercial world, something which seems to be getting increasingly more elusive...|$|E

For disease-infectious tick species, the threshold recommended dipping whenever any <b>ticks</b> <b>were</b> present. If disease control benefits are omitted, as in some past work, thresholds will be overstated and dipping recommendations understated when infectious <b>ticks</b> <b>are</b> present...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{describe}} the two most currently used Non - Electronic English textbooks in Banjarmasin in the aspects of (1) the content appropriateness, (2) the presentation appropriateness, (3) the language appropriateness, and (4) their use in Banjarmasin. This research was descriptive qualitative that was supported by quantitative data. The textbooks were evaluated using Krippendorf’s content analysis (2004 : 83) : unitizing, sampling, coding, reducing data, inferring contextual phenomena, and narrating the result. Criteria used were from Pedoman Penilaian Buku Teks Pelajaran Bahasa Inggris developed by the Board of National Education Standard Team, the Ministry of National Education (2007). The data were collected through observations, interview, and C-Test. The research took place in nine SMANs in Banjarmasin from January 2012 to May 2012. The respondents were all of the 102 eleventh grade students and nine English teachers. The validity used democratic validity and triangulation while the reliability used inter-coder reliability. The democratic validity was reached through giving all school components like principals, teachers, and students chances to speak while the triangulation was through experts’ crosscheck. The inter-coders were given the needed data that should <b>be</b> <b>ticked</b> then concluded and counted the mean so that the final conclusion was more objective. The result of the study shows as follows. (1) In the content appropriateness, the two textbooks have met 100...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} competence, {{as it is}} brought into play in current research, is a {{potentially}} powerful construct for entrepreneurship education and training research and practice. Although the concept {{has been the subject}} of strong debate in educational research in general, critical analysis of how it has been used, applied and experienced in entrepreneurship education practice is scarce. This article contributes specifically to the discussion of entrepreneurial competence by theoretically unfolding and discussing the concept. Subsequently, the implications of applying a competence-based approach in entrepreneurship education are illustrated and discussed based on analysis of two cases that were aimed at identifying, diagnosing and eventually developing entrepreneurial competence in small businesses in the Netherlands and Flanders (Belgium). The cases show that the added value of focussing on competence in entrepreneurship education and training lies in making the (potential) small business owner aware of the importance of certain entrepreneurial competencies and in providing direction for competence development. In this process it is fundamental that competence is treated as an item for discussion and interpretation, rather than as a fixed template of boxes to <b>be</b> <b>ticked.</b> Furthermore the cases highlight that a competence-based approach does not completely determine the type of educational and instructional strategies to be used. Its consequential power in that respect is limited. Entrepreneurship, competence, small business, learning, education...|$|E
40|$|Games are {{extremely}} complex pieces of software which give life to animated virtual worlds. Games require complex algorithms, large worlds filled with many intelligent entities and high-quality graphics, {{and it all}} must run in real time. Building general, high-performance frameworks capable of represent- ing any virtual world has, until now, proven to be an elusive task; existing solutions either sacrifice performance (X 3 D browsers) or generality (game engines). In this paper we present a model that formalizes our notion of a correct game. This model gives all the important properties that game developers struggle to maintain by hand, that is the strong normalization of the tick function, the independence from {{the order of the}} ticks of each entity, and the fact that all active entities of the game state must <b>be</b> <b>ticked</b> exactly once. We define the Casanova language around this model, with the aim of achieving the threefold objective of creating games that are correct, declarative (and thus simpler to write) and fast to run. We will use a linear type system to enforce the uniqueness of our entities (to ensure exactly one tick for each) and to ensure that ticks do not have overlapping effects. We will impose certain restrictions on the state to avoid infinite loops in the update function (in the shape of cyclic references) and we will use a specialized type system {{to make sure that all}} the active coroutines of the game will always yield...|$|E
