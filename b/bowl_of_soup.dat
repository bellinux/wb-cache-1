5|$|The detainees at Omarska had {{one meal}} a day. The food was usually spoiled {{and the process}} of getting the food, eating and {{returning}} the plate usually lasted around three minutes. Meals were often accompanied by beatings. The toilets were blocked and there was human waste everywhere. British journalist Ed Vulliamy testified that when he visited the camp, the detainees were in very poor physical condition. He witnessed them eating a <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> <b>soup</b> and some bread and said that he had the impression they had not eaten in a long time; they appeared terrified. According to Vulliamy, the detainees drank water from a river that was polluted with industrial waste and many suffered from constipation or dysentery. No criminal report was ever filed against persons detained in the Omarska camp, nor were the detainees apprised of any concrete charges against them. Apparently, there was no legitimate reason justifying these people’s detention.|$|E
25|$|Having {{seemingly}} {{recovered from}} his illness, Cook met with Palmer for coffee on 17 November, and soon found himself sick once again. At this point Palmer assumed responsibility for Cook; Cook's solicitor, Jeremiah Smith, sent over a <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> <b>soup,</b> which Palmer {{had in his}} possession before he sent it {{to the kitchen to}} be reheated. Chambermaid Elizabeth Mills took two spoonfuls of the soup and subsequently fell ill; Cook was given the rest of the soup, and his vomiting became worse than ever.|$|E

25|$|His {{background}} is explored {{further in the}} comic book Serenity: The Shepherd's Tale. Book was born Henry Evans, a boy who was raised by an abusive father. He {{ran away from home}} and began life as a petty criminal before being recruited by the Independence movement and moving out to the Border Worlds. Long before the Alliance begins the Unification War, forward-thinking Browncoats assign Evans to be a long-term mole. He sheds his old identity by killing a random passerby and stealing his identification card, becoming Derrial Book. His Browncoat superiors keep tabs on him by surgically removing one of his eyes and replacing it with a camera. He joins the Alliance military and quickly moves up in rank. Becoming an officer, Book intentionally leads a risky operation that results in a humiliating defeat for the Alliance. He is forced to retire from the Alliance military. It is implied that the Alliance covers up the loss, therefore not officially punishing Book. Homeless, he visits a soup kitchen and finds God while contemplating a <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> <b>soup.</b> He takes refuge at an abbey where he becomes a shepherd before leaving on Serenity to become a missionary.|$|E
25|$|The Spirit of Progress {{ushered in}} a {{standard}} of passenger train speed and comfort not previously seen in Australia. Its introduction in November 1937 marked the culmination of many years of preparatory work by the Victorian Railways, from the laying of heavier rail on the North East line, introduction of Automatic Staff Exchange apparatus to allow continuous high speed running between track sections, introduction of high-powered three-cylinder Pacific locomotives, and the testing of air conditioning equipment on passenger rolling stock. Such was the commitment of VR Chief Commissioner Harold Clapp to introducing a world-class train service to Victorian Railways, virtually no detail was overlooked. VR engineers famously road-tested the new train's smoothness on curves by studying a full <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> <b>soup</b> in the dining car as the train took curves at full speed; if the soup splashed {{over the side of}} the bowl a decision would be taken whether to modify the curve for higher speeds or reduce the speed limit for the curve. Harold Clapp could not, however, take credit for the name for the service; when discussing with his wife his proposed Royal Victorian name (inspired by the LMS Royal Scot), Mrs Clapp suggested, on the spur of the moment, Spirit of Progress.|$|E

[...] However, the Foundation discovered that their choice of location for this endeavour — near Waterloo station on the South Bank — was unusually devoid of homeless people, {{many of whom were}} in homeless shelters for the day. [...] "That was a pity", said Jimmy Cauty. [...] "If you are down-and-out, would you rather have a <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> <b>soup</b> or a can of Tennent's?"

500|$|The BLT {{became popular}} after World War II {{because of the}} rapid {{expansion}} of supermarkets, which allowed ingredients to be available year-round. The initials, representing [...] "bacon, lettuce, tomato", likely began in the American restaurant industry as shorthand for the sandwich, but it is unclear when this transferred to the public consciousness. For example, a 1951 edition of the Saturday Evening Post makes reference to the sandwich, although it does not use its initials, describing a scene in which: [...] "On the tray, invariably, are a <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> <b>soup,</b> a toasted sandwich of bacon, lettuce and tomato, and a chocolate milk shake." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 3, 2005, Bemis {{had another}} breakdown; this time, it {{involved}} depressive behaviour, spitting in food {{at an outdoor}} cafe, spending a [...] "half-hour pouring a <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> <b>soup</b> onto the floor, one spoonful at a time," [...] engaging in a street fight and finally being admitted to a mental hospital by an off-duty policeman. This incident forced Say Anything to cancel another tour, this time with Bemis' personal idols Saves the Day, along with Senses Fail and The Early November. The band was replaced by Emanuel. After returning from his stay in the hospital, Bemis' mother and the remaining members of the band selected the Menninger clinic in Houston, Texas, to rehab Bemis. Eventually, Bemis approved of their decision, admitted himself to the Menninger clinic, and has reportedly not had a relapse since.|$|E
500|$|Warhol {{followed}} {{the success of}} his original series with several related works incorporating the same theme of Campbell's Soup cans subjects. These subsequent works along with the original are collectively referred to as the Campbell's Soup cans series and often simply as the Campbell's Soup cans. The subsequent Campbell's Soup can works were very diverse. The heights ranged from [...] to [...] Generally, the cans were portrayed as if they were freshly produced cans without flaws. Occasionally, he chose to depict cans with torn labels, peeling labels, crushed bodies, or opened lids like those in the images in this section. Sometimes he added related items like a <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> <b>soup</b> or a can opener, such as the one in the image on the right. Sometimes he produced images of related items without any soup cans such as Campbell's Tomato Juice Box (above right), which are not strictly a part of the series although a part of the theme. Many of these works were produced at his famous studio [...] "The Factory." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{section of}} critics {{wrote on the}} {{relevance}} of the movie to the current times. In an interview, Gatlif stated that he wanted the movie to mirror the current times, adding that the times have not changed much, and that while the political extermination has gone, the psychological and political views of Romani have not. He criticised the French law that allows wanderers to stay in one place only for 24 hours. He was also critical of the plight of Romani in Hungary, Romania and Italy. He went on that the state of the Romani now in many places, [...] "with the rows of homeless people waiting for a <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> <b>soup</b> with a tin can on their hands", is not very different from that in the concentration camps. Gatlif also lashed out against the fact that until 1969, Romani were required to have their papers stamped at a police station or city hall whenever they arrived at or left a French village. Bob Hill at Moving Pictures Network remarked that the movie draws parallels to the fact that [...] "we are once again veering toward a culture in which regimes and wealth determine who has the right to live free — and who has no rights at all", and cited present happenings such as the developments in the Middle East, racial wars and inter-country disputes. It added that the movie makes the audience ask themselves if they live in a society that embraces or condemns diversity.|$|E
2500|$|On the 2007 Browncoat Cruise, Ron Glass {{revealed}} with Whedon's permission several {{facts about}} Book, including that Derrial {{was not the}} shepherd's real name, but {{the name of a}} man he had killed.

This was part of an announcement for a comic book series based on Book's past, titled The Shepherd's Tale. Scott Allie, editor for the [...] comic series, confirmed this announcement and stated that Dark Horse Comics was aiming for a late 2008 release. It was later announced that this would be seeing print in November 2010, and was subsequently released November 3, 2010.|$|E
2500|$|According to Eugene Chavette, {{author of}} a {{restaurant}} guide in 1867, there were 812 restaurants in Paris, 1,664 cafés, 3,523 debits de vin, 257 crémeries, and 207 tables d'hôtes. [...] The latter were inexpensive eating places, often with a common table, where a meal could be had for 1.6 francs, with a <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> <b>soup,</b> a choice of one of three main dishes, a dessert, bread, and a half-bottle of wine. [...] As the guidebook for foreign visitors noted, [...] "A few of these restaurants are truly good; many others are bad." [...] Ingredients were typically of poor quality. The soup was a thin broth of bouillon; as each spoonful of soup {{was taken from the}} pot, an equal amount of water was usually added, so the broth became thinner and thinner.|$|E

2500|$|The navvies {{working on}} the Liverpool and Manchester Railway were paid daily and their pay reputedly went on ale, leaving little for food. When the workers were unfit to work, monies were {{subtracted}} from their wages and meal tokens were issued. These tokens could be handed in at meal caravans for a <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> <b>soup</b> and a portion of bread. At first the token was {{a slip of paper}} called a [...] "flimsy" [...] because of its thickness. In today's terms it would be similar to a grade called [...] "bank paper". As these tokens could be copied by the forgers, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway supplied its contractors with six-sided food tokens that were surrendered for meals. These were cut from brass and had the initials LMR stamped upon them. This reduced the problems of drunken navvies and eliminated the local farm labourers freeloading from the food caravans. Tokens and a description of their use {{can be found in the}} Museum of Science & Industry in Manchester.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1963, {{a series}} of {{celebrations}} were held by Buddhist priests all over South Vietnam to honor the 2,527th anniversary of Lord Buddha's birthday. The Catholic Diem disapproved of the birthday celebrations of Lord Buddha and {{a series of}} clashes occurred all over South Vietnam as the police sought to end the marches. When she heard that Diệm was to sign a statement offering compensation to the families of Buddhist protesters shot dead by the police of his brother Ngô Đình Cẩn, she was reported to have thrown a <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> <b>soup</b> at him. On 8 June 1963, Madame Nhu released a statement through the Women's Solidarity Movement accusing the Buddhists of neutralism, effectively accusing them of being communist collaborators. It then implored [...] "bonzes of good faith" [...] to stop helping the communists, otherwise Vietnamese Buddhism would be seen as a [...] "small anti-nationalist branch of a dubious international association, exploited and controlled by communism and oriented to the sowing of the disorder of neutralism" [...] and calling on Diem to [...] "immediately expel all foreign agitators whether they wear monks' robes or not." [...] She made another attack on the United States, calling on Diệm to [...] "keep vigilance on all others, particularly those inclined to take Viet Nam for [...] satellite of [...] foreign power or organization." [...] Madame Nhu publicly mocked Thích Quảng Đức, who performed a self-immolation on 11 June 1963 in a crowded Saigon street to protest against the shooting of Buddhists by Diệm's regime. She labelled it a [...] "barbecue" [...] and stated, [...] "Let them burn and we shall clap our hands." [...] She further offered to provide more fuel and matches for the Buddhists, noting the [...] "barbecuing" [...] was not [...] "self-sufficient" [...] because [...] "imported gasoline" [...] was used. The monk's suicide followed Ngo Dinh Nhu's repression of the Buddhist-inspired protests and was responsible for the regime's continuing instability. [...] According to historian Howard Jones, these comments [...] "all but put the finishing touch on the Diệm regime".|$|E
