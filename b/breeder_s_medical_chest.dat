25|$|A form of telepharmacy {{has been}} in use by Australia's Royal Flying Doctor Service since 1942. <b>Medical</b> <b>chests</b> {{containing}} medications and equipment are placed in remote communities {{where they can be}} administered to patients during a telehealth consultation. Some 3,500 chests were distributed around Australia as of 2006. In one year, Queensland recorded 21,470 telehealth consultations, of which 13.7% resulted in administration of a medication from a <b>medical</b> <b>chest.</b> The medication types administered most often are antibiotics, analgesics and gastrointestinal medications. This system improves access to both emergency and routine medical care in remote parts of Australia and reduces the need for patients to travel to seek medical care.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} year of 1626 the Privy Council decided {{to pay the}} Barber-Surgeons Company fixed allowances to furnish <b>medical</b> <b>chests</b> for both the army and navy, and Woodall was appointed to supervise this scheme {{in addition to his}} long-standing similar commitment to the East India Company.|$|R

40|$|In {{recent times}} remote medical {{practice}} {{has been developed}} into a unique discipline {{in its own right}} with telehealth one of the eight defining key features. Since 1942, the telemedicine consultation service provided by the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Australia has been supported by a tele-pharmacy program known as the Medical Chest Program. The contents of the chest comprise more than 85 items, including medications and equipment which can be prescribed during a telehealth consultation to cover both emergency care and definitive treatment for less serious conditions. By 2006 there were 3500 <b>medical</b> <b>chests</b> placed throughout Australia. Specifically, the state of Queensland had 21 470 telehealth consultations from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006, resulting in the prescription of at least one <b>medical</b> <b>chest</b> item in 2938 (13. 7 %) consultations. Queensland data regarding medication indicate that antibiotics (26 %), analgesics (23 %) and gastrointestinal medications (12 %) were the most common categories of dispensed medications, and that the most common clinical diagnostic categories for the consultation resulting in dispensed medications were respiratory (17 %), skin (15 %) and abdominal conditions (13 %). In summary, the RFDS <b>medical</b> <b>chest</b> program continues to be a successful large scale provider of medications to those living in remote Australia, enabling early access to medications for both emergencies and definitive care, while minimising the need for mail-order pharmacy or patient travel. This model of care ma...|$|R

40|$|Atotal of 681 {{students}} {{graduating from}} allopathic medical {{schools in the}} United States matched into psychiatry residencies in 2013 (1).

When compared with the ever-increasing numbers of people living in the U.

40|$|In 2005 - 2006, {{about one-quarter}} (24. 6 %) of all visits to office-based {{physicians}} were to international medical graduates. Hispanic or Latino and Asian or Pacific Islander patients made more visits to international medical graduates (24. 9 %) than to U. <b>S.</b> <b>medical</b> graduates (12. 4 %). International medical graduates {{also saw a}} higher percentage of visits made by patients expecting to use Medicaid or State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) as their primary payment source (17. 6 %) compared with U. <b>S.</b> <b>medical</b> graduates (10. 2 %). In 2005 - 2006, international medical graduates comprised 24. 5 % of all office-based physicians. International medical graduates {{were more likely to be}} of Asian or Pacific Islander (31. 6 % compared with 4. 9 % of U. <b>S.</b> <b>medical</b> graduates) and Hispanic or Latino descent (6. 7 % compared with 1. 5 % of U. <b>S.</b> <b>medical</b> graduates). International medical graduates were more likely to practice in primary care shortage areas outside of metropolitan statistical areas (67. 8 %) than U. <b>S.</b> <b>medical</b> graduates (39. 8 %). Over the past 30 years, the number of international medical graduates in the physician workforce has steadily increased. Many entered the United States on visas that allowed them to stay in the United States if they agreed to work in an underserved area for 3 years following residency. During the last decade, however, the number of international medical graduates on these visas declined by 47 % as use of less-restrictive temporary specialized worker visas increased. The declining number of international medical graduates serving in underserved areas has made recruiting physicians in these areas more difficult. In order to examine the overall role of international medical graduates in providing office-based medical care, this Data Brief compares patient and physician characteristics for office-based international medical graduates with those of U. <b>S.</b> <b>medical</b> graduates.

40|$|Background: Recent {{reports on}} the state of {{nutrition}} in U. <b>S.</b> <b>medical</b> schools suggest that these schools are challenged to incorporate nutrition into an already full curriculum. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the current state of nutrition education in US medical schools based on information reported by individuals responsible for teaching nutrition to medical students. Design: Between July 1999 and May 2000, we surveyed 122 U. <b>S.</b> <b>medical</b> and osteopathic schools. The survey was mailed to the nutrition educator at each institution; recipients could return the survey via mail, fax, or the web. Results: The majority of the 98 medical schools responding to the survey provided nutrition education. In 90 % of responding U. <b>S.</b> <b>medical</b> and osteopathic schools (representing 88 of 98 schools and over 65 % of all institutions), all students were guaranteed exposure to nutrition. An average of 18 ± 12 hours of nutrition was required, including material integrated into other types of courses. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that nutrition education is an integral part of the curriculum for the majority of US medical schools surveyed. A number of medical schools have chosen to incorporate nutrition education into already established basic science and clinical courses...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the impact of}} a web tool developed to improve health care providers 2 ̆ 7 ability and comfort in caring for a diverse patient population in the hospital setting. Methods: The pediatric palliative care team including a pediatric oncologist and a nurse practitioner in association with a clinical medical librarian and a hospital-based interpreter, collaborated to create a resource using SpringShare software to create a library guide. The purpose is to provide cultural and palliative care information resources, books, and journal articles to assist health care workers at UMass Memorial Children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Medical</b> Center in caring for children from the diverse cultural backgrounds living in the region. In order to introduce and evaluate the usage of the library guide, we plan to survey Children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Medical</b> Center staff including nurses, residents, attending physicians, and child life staff at baseline and after visiting the library guide.
