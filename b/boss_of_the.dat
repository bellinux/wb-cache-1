The 50 in opposition preferred an alternative proposal drawn up by Uruguayan astronomer Julio Ángel Fernández.|$|E
5|$|As the qabaday (local youth <b>boss)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> al-Shaghour {{quarter of}} Damascus, al-Kharrat was {{connected}} with Nasib al-Bakri, a nationalist from the quarter's most influential family. At al-Bakri's invitation, al-Kharrat joined the revolt in August 1925 {{and formed a}} group of fighters from al-Shaghour and other neighborhoods in the vicinity. He led the rebel assault against Damascus, briefly capturing the residence of French High-Commissioner Maurice Sarrail before withdrawing amid heavy French bombardment.|$|E
5|$|By World War I, all of {{the major}} powers were experimenting with {{aircraft}} mounted cannon; however their low rate of fire and great size and weight precluded any of them from being anything other than experimental. The most successful (or least unsuccessful) was the SPAD 12 Ca.1 with a single 37mm Puteaux mounted to fire between the cylinder banks and through the propeller <b>boss</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft's Hispano-Suiza 8C. The pilot (by necessity an ace) had to manually reload each round.|$|E
50|$|According to this model, {{the main}} 'battleground' for {{organized}} labour {{moves from the}} shop floor to the boardroom, where well-paid business leaders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> union negotiate with well-paid <b>bosses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company.|$|R
50|$|For five years, MacLaurin {{handled the}} PR for Richard Desmond, and “masterminded his {{transformation}} from vilified porn baron to respectable newspaper proprietor”, shepherding the Northern & Shell <b>boss</b> through some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most “colourful episodes in recent Fleet Street history,” including the reported episode when Desmond goose-stepped in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bosses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Telegraph.|$|R

5|$|The Commission met from July 7, 1926 – February 16, 1927, and Virginia Chief Justice Robert R. Prentis was {{appointed}} its chair. Governor Harry F. Byrd, Sr., the successor <b>boss</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Organization in Virginia, sought and gained governmental reform streamlining local government {{and increasing the}} power of the governor over the executive, as well as implementing constitutional restrictions on the General Assembly's ability to incur debt.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} video games that are {{loosely based on}} the film: The first video game based on the film was titled Beauty and the Beast and is an action {{platformer}} developed by Probe Software and published by Hudson Soft for the NES.

2500|$|Bernardo Provenzano ( [...] ; 31 January 1933 – 13 July 2016) was {{a member}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sicilian Mafia (Cosa Nostra) and was {{suspected}} <b>of</b> having been <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Corleonesi, a Mafia faction that originated in <b>the</b> town <b>of</b> Corleone, and de facto capo di tutti capi (<b>boss</b> <b>of</b> all <b>bosses)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire Sicilian Mafia until his arrest in 2006.|$|R
50|$|Franco Giuseppucci (March 3, 1947 - September 13, 1980) was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> founders and <b>bosses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Banda della Magliana, an Italian {{criminal}} {{organization based}} in <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Rome that was particularly active throughout the late 1970s until the early 1990s.|$|R
5|$|Using {{his various}} natural {{abilities}} and occasionally items or power-ups, Kirby must overcome obstacles while heading towards a goal door {{at end of}} the level, where he must fight a boss to obtain one of the Sparkling Stars. Most bosses are fought by sucking up the projectiles they create and spitting them back at the boss, however, the <b>boss</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third level briefly turns the game into a Shoot 'em up. The last level before the final boss consists of a boss rush, where the player must fight all of the game's bosses again going through a short area based on the boss's home level.|$|E
5|$|Barring Link's {{progress}} are creatures he must {{battle to}} locate the entrances to nine underground dungeons. Each dungeon is a unique, maze-like collection of rooms connected by doors and secret passages, and guarded by monsters different from those found on the surface. Dungeons also contain useful items which Link can add to his arsenal, such as a boomerang for retrieving distant items and stunning enemies, and a recorder with magical properties. Link must successfully navigate through {{each of the first}} eight dungeons to obtain all eight pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom. Once he has completed the artifact, he can enter the ninth dungeon to rescue Zelda. Apart from this exception, the order of completing dungeons is somewhat left to the player, although they steadily increase in difficulty and some of them can only be reached or completed using items gained in a previous one. In addition, the entrances of the three highest-level dungeons are hidden. Link can freely wander the overworld, finding and buying items at any point. This flexibility enables unusual ways of playing the game. For example, it is possible to reach the final <b>boss</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game without ever receiving the first sword.|$|E
5|$|Levels {{include a}} variety of {{anthropomorphic}} vegetable enemies, such as potatoes and squash, each with different movement patterns and attacks. Levels can also include hazards, such as water or spikes; touching a hazard or most enemies causes Keen to lose a life, and the game is ended if all of Keen's lives are lost. Unlike the previous game, Keen can not shoot enemies with a raygun; instead he collects small pellets throughout the levels called flower power to throw at enemies. If an enemy is hit, they transform into a passive, intangible flower for a limited time, while pellets that do not hit an enemy can be retrieved by the player. The player can also find food items {{in the form of}} sweets throughout the levels which grant points, with an extra life awarded if the player earns enough points, as well as figures of Keen that grant an extra life. Placed throughout the levels are collectible bombs, which the player must use at least twelve of in order to defeat the final <b>boss</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game.|$|E
50|$|He {{was also}} {{involved}} in trafficking heroin from Turkey, smuggled in by fishing boats controlled by the Coluccio-Aquino 'Ndrina in Marina di Gioiosa Ionica. He is a cousin of Rocco Aquino and Giuseppe Aquino, <b>the</b> <b>bosses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aquino 'ndrina in the town.|$|R
50|$|According to Antonio Ingroia, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{prosecutors}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Direzione Distrettuale Antimafia (DDA) <b>of</b> Palermo, <b>the</b> main leading {{figures in}} Cosa Nostra at the moment, Matteo Messina Denaro, Giovanni Riina, Domenico Raccuglia, Pietro Tagliavia and Nicchi, {{are still too}} young to be recognized as leading <b>bosses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organization.|$|R

5|$|Nintendo {{eventually}} migrated {{the development}} of Ocarina of Time from disk to cartridge media due to the high data performance requirements imposed by continuously reading 500 motion-captured character animations throughout gameplay, intending to follow its release with a 64DD expansion disk. At its release, the 32-megabyte game would be the largest game Nintendo had ever created. Early in the game's development, concerns about the data storage constraints of the N64 cartridge led producer and supervisor Shigeru Miyamoto to imagine a worst-case scenario in which Ocarina of Time would follow a similar structure to Super Mario 64 with Link being restricted to Ganondorf's castle as a central hub, and using a portal system similar to the paintings that Mario uses to traverse the realm. An idea that arose from this stage of development, a battle with a doppelganger of Ganondorf that rides through paintings, ultimately made {{its way into the}} finished game as the <b>boss</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest Temple dungeon.|$|E
5|$|One {{day while}} Wayne is walking {{home in the}} rain and hail, Homer sees Wayne and he reluctantly agrees to let Homer drive him to Moe's Tavern for a drink. While Wayne is in the bathroom, Snake {{dramatically}} crashes through the door on his motorcycle to rob everyone. As soon as Wayne comes out, he soundly beats up Snake. The story spreads quickly and a news segment that features an interview with Wayne by Kent Brockman and a computer animated Taiwanese dramatization of the incident soon airs on television. It is discovered that Wayne is a highly trained former CIA black ops agent, who decided to go into hiding in Springfield. He is plagued by recurring flashbacks from his previous missions, which cause him to act or shout them out, as evidenced when he unintentionally attacks Mr. Burns, the <b>boss</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power plant, which results in Wayne being fired.|$|E
5|$|The third {{video game}} {{based on the}} film was titled Beauty & The Beast: Roar of the Beast and is a side-scrolling video game for the Genesis. As the Beast, the player must {{successfully}} complete several levels, based on scenes from the film, {{in order to protect}} the castle from invading villagers and forest animals and rescue Belle from Gaston. The fourth video game based on the film was titled Disney's Beauty and the Beast and is an action platformer for the SNES. It was developed by Probe Entertainment and published by Hudson Soft in North America in July 1994 and in Europe on February 23, 1995. The game was published by Virgin Interactive in Japan on July 8, 1994. The entire game is played through the perspective of the Beast. As the Beast, the player must get Belle to fall in love so that the curse cast upon him and his castle will be broken. The final <b>boss</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game is Gaston. The Beast can walk, jump, swipe, stomp, super stomp, and roar, the last of which is used to both damage enemies and reveal hidden objects.|$|E
2500|$|Bernardo Provenzano (1933–2016), {{successor}} of Riina as head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Corleonesi faction and as {{such was}} considered one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most powerful <b>bosses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sicilian Mafia. Provenzano was a fugitive from justice since 1963. He was captured on 11 April 2006 in Sicily. Before capture, authorities had reportedly been [...] "close" [...] to capturing him for 10 years.|$|R
50|$|He {{is known}} as Faccia dAngelo ("Angel Face") and o Romano, due to his {{business}} connections in Rome. In 2001, Contini was included on <b>the</b> list <b>of</b> most wanted fugitives in Italy and eventually captured on December 14, 2007. Prior to his arrest, he was alleged to be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most powerful <b>bosses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Camorra.|$|R
40|$|I {{should like}} to thank Paddy McDowell, former Managing Director, Marshalls Confirming, and Ian Ballack, First National Trust and Asset Management, for helping me make contact with many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{financial}} <b>bosses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city, past and present. Thanks also go to my research assistant, Buntu Siwisa, for his painstaking trawling <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> financial journals and newspapers from 1970 - 1997...|$|R
5|$|Vocalisations are {{frequent}} as the juveniles disperse, {{and again as}} they congregate in the morning. Nearby adults, presumably the parents, also give signals warning of predators or alerting the youngsters {{to the presence of}} food. The range and quantity of vocalisations vary between species. Alligators are the noisiest, while some crocodile species are almost completely silent. Adult female New Guinea crocodiles and Siamese crocodiles roar when approached by another adult, while Nile crocodiles grunt or bellow in a similar situation. The American alligator is exceptionally noisy; it emits a series of about seven throaty bellows, each a couple of seconds long, at ten second intervals. It also makes various grunts and hisses. Males create vibrations in the water to send out infrasonic signals that serve to attract females and intimidate rivals. The enlarged <b>boss</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male gharial may serve as a sound resonator.|$|E
5|$|The Creator, after {{creating}} Aquaria, {{created a}} series of civilizations, making a new one in turn when each one was destroyed. The Creator kidnaps Li, with whom Naija has fallen in love, and she attacks the Creator to get him back. The player defeats the god as the final <b>boss</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, and returns home with Li. In the epilogue, Naija is shown with Li and their child. If the player has found all of Naija's memories by discovering places she remembers, they reveal that the shadowy figure {{at the beginning of}} the game was her mother, Mia. Mia was made by the Creator and had the ability, like Naija, to use the different powers of all of the civilizations. She fled the Creator, and hid herself and Naija among several communities in succession; after the destruction of the last one she erased Naija's memory so that she would find out the history of Aquaria on her own and defeat the Creator. In the extended epilogue shown if the player has found all of the memories, Mia appears, telling Naija that the two of them can conquer the civilisations above the water. After Naija refuses, Mia kidnaps her, and vanishes; the extended epilogue ends with Lucien, Naija and Li's son, leaving to find her. If the player has not found all of the memories, the epilogue instead ends with Naija asking the player to find out about her past, and revealing that the narration of the game was intended to be heard by her son.|$|E

25|$|Marino Mannoia {{provided}} the first eyewitness account tying Andreotti directly to <b>bosses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mafia. He described a high-level meeting in 1980 with Salvatore Inzerillo and Stefano Bontade at which Andreotti allegedly arrived with Lima in a bulletproof Alfa Romeo {{belonging to the}} Salvo cousins. Andreotti had come to protest the killing by <b>the</b> Mafia <b>of</b> Piersanti Mattarella in January 1980.|$|R
50|$|After the Gennas fled, the Aiello {{brothers}} declared themselves <b>the</b> <b>bosses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old Genna territory. The Aiellos had {{an alliance}} with Castellammarese Clan boss Salvatore Maranzano and a close connection to the North Siders. They attempted to murder Capone {{to become the most}} powerful Italian organization in Chicago. In 1930, Joe Aiello was murdered and Capone took over the territory.|$|R
50|$|Antonio Cottone - {{deported}} to Sicily, {{where he became}} <b>the</b> Mafia <b>boss</b> <b>of</b> Villabate, <b>the</b> home town for the Profaci family. Cotonne was murdered in 1956.|$|R
