Blue-ringed octopuses in the genus Hapalochlaena, which live around Australia and New Guinea, bite humans only if severely provoked, but their venom kills 25% of human victims. Another tropical species, Octopus apollyon, causes severe inflammation that {{can last for}} over a month even if treated correctly, and the bite of Octopus rubescens can cause necrosis that lasts longer than one month if untreated, and headaches and weakness persisting {{for up to a}} week even if treated.|$|E

5|$|Eveline Hańska (Ewelina, née Rzewuska, 6 January c.1805– 11 April 1882) was a Polish noblewoman {{best known}} for her {{marriage}} to French novelist Honoré de Balzac. Born at the Wierzchownia estate in Volhynia, (now Ukraine) Hańska married landowner Wacław Hański (Wenceslas Hanski) when she was a teenager.

5|$|Extant {{documentation}} {{makes it}} possible to follow the competition more clearly than {{in the case of the}} shrine dei Miracoli, and the delivered works, their dates and respective payments lend themselves to interesting analyses. By Tamagnino's arrival in 1499, Cairano already had delivered at least five different Caesars and other stone material, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> payment for a single bust is documented, because his attention was completely taken up with two gigantic angular trophies that he had recently begun. In November 1499, Tamagnino delivered four Caesars and three leonine busts, which showcased his calibre and scale of production.|$|E

Around midday Newport's Golden Dragon, followed by Roebuck - bigger than Dainty, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> fraction of the Madre, joined the fray. These were followed at two-hour intervals by Foresight and Prudence in the evening. The Dainty had her foremast shot away and was out of the battle for five hours.|$|E

5|$|The {{movement}} spawned {{perhaps a}} thousand metal bands, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few survived {{the advent of}} MTV {{and the rise of}} the more commercial glam metal in the second half of the 1980s.

Other groups, such as Diamond Head, Venom and Raven, remained underground, but were a major influence on the successful extreme metal subgenres of the late 1980s and 1990s. Many bands from the NWOBHM reunited in the 2000s and remained active through live performances and new studio albums.|$|E

5|$|After Germany {{occupied}} Hungary in March 1944, the genocidal {{policies of}} the authorities were applied comprehensively. Hungarian Jews were subjected to starvation and death marches, and those that had remained {{in the occupied territories}} were transported to extermination camps. From 26 April 1944, the remaining Jews in Bačka and Baranja, mostly women, but including children and the elderly, were rounded up into local concentration camps then moved to larger camps in Hungary proper. Between 14,000 and 15,000 Jews from Bačka, Baranja and other parts of Hungary were collected at Baja and Bácsalmás then transported to Auschwitz where most were killed. In September 1944, the workforce of the Bor mine was force-marched for several weeks back to extermination camps where the survivors were killed. One of the two groups of workers numbered 2,500, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few survived.|$|E
5|$|Banff National Park has a subarctic climate {{with three}} ecoregions, {{including}} montane, subalpine, and alpine. The forests {{are dominated by}} Lodgepole pine at lower elevations and Engelmann spruce in higher ones below the treeline, above which is primarily rocks and ice. Mammal species such as the grizzly, cougar, wolverine, elk, bighorn sheep and moose are found, along with hundreds of bird species. Reptiles and amphibians are also found <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> limited number of species have been recorded. The mountains are formed from sedimentary rocks which were pushed east over newer rock strata, between 80 and 55million years ago. Over the past few million years, glaciers have at times covered most of the park, but today are found only on the mountain slopes though they include the Columbia Icefield, the largest uninterrupted glacial mass in the Rockies. Erosion from water and ice have carved the mountains into their current shapes.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the North Vietnamese {{offensive}} {{was slowly}} rolling over ARVN opposition {{north and south}} of Da Nang. General Dong's plan called for attacks on the area from the west, north, and south that would drive South Vietnamese forces into Da Nang, where they could be destroyed. The highway between Huế and Da Nang was cut at Phu Loc after severe fighting on 22 March. South of Da Nang, the 2nd ARVN Division barely managed to contain a North Vietnamese drive toward Tam Kỳ and the coastal plain. On the morning of 24 March, however, the 711th Division, backed by armored elements, seized Tam Kỳ, driving the population north toward Da Nang by the thousands. PAVN forces then cut Highway 1 between Quảng Ngãi and Chu Lai, a move to which the 2nd ARVN Division was too battered to respond. With Corps approval, South Vietnamese troops from Quảng Ngãi fought their way northward, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few managed to reach Chu Lai. In a single day the situation in I Corps had deteriorated beyond control.|$|E
5|$|Mukund Raj {{was another}} poet from the {{community}} {{who lived in the}} 13th century and {{is said to be the}} first poet who composed in Marathi. He is known for the Viveka-Siddhi and Parammrita which are metaphysical, pantheistic works connected with orthodox Vedantism. Other well known Deshastha literary scholars of the 17th century were Mukteshwar and Shridhar. Mukteshwar was the grandson of Eknath and is the most distinguished poet in the ovi meter. He is most known for translating the Mahabharata and the Ramayana in Marathi <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> part of the Mahabharata translation is available and the entire Ramayana translation is lost. Shridhar Kulkarni came from near Pandharpur and his works are said to have superseded the Sanskrit epics to a certain extent.

5|$|Semaphore signals {{were used}} on the very first railway lines, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> bare minimum were {{provided}} as the time interval system being relied upon instead. The first interlocking of signals to protect trains was provided in 1874, as before this time conflicting moves could be made. The design of the signals also progressed, with the disc type siding signals first introduced in 1885, and the lower quadrant somersault type main line signals adopted in 1887, {{both of which are}} still in use today. Green was not adopted as the All Right colour until 1898, with white being used before this time. Red was the usual colour of all signal arms, until yellow was chosen as the colour for distant signals in 1926, with full adoption made in 1930. Colour light signals first appeared in 1918, and by 1924 they were the standard for new installations.|$|E
