5000|$|To achieve maximum output, a pure 802.11n 5 GHz {{network is}} recommended. The 5 GHz band has {{substantial}} capacity due to many non-overlapping radio channels and less radio interference {{as compared to}} the 2.4 GHz band. An 802.11n-only network may be impractical for many users because they need to support legacy equipment that still is 802.11b/g only. In a mixed-mode system, an optimal solution would be to use a dual-radio access point and place the 802.11b/g traffic on the 2.4 GHz radio and the 802.11n traffic on the 5 GHz radio. [...] This setup assumes that all the 802.11n clients are 5 GHz capable, which isn't a requirement of the standard. Quite a few Wi-Fi-capable devices only support the 2.4 GHz and there is no practical way to upgrade them to support 5 GHz. Some enterprise-grade APs use <b>band</b> <b>steering</b> to send 802.11n clients to the 5 GHz band, leaving the 2.4 GHz band for legacy clients. <b>Band</b> <b>steering</b> works by responding only to 5 GHz association requests and not the 2.4 GHz requests from dual-band clients.|$|E

5000|$|Sweetnighter is Weather Report's fourth album, {{released}} on Columbia Records in 1973. The group had recorded the songs in a five-day stretch during February {{of the same}} year. It {{was to be the}} last album to feature founding member Miroslav Vitouš as the primary bassist. Zawinul began to assert greater control of the <b>band,</b> <b>steering</b> it away from the collective improvisation that marked its live performances toward more structured compositions emphasizing funk and groove. This was exemplified by the album's two dominant tracks, [...] "Boogie Woogie Waltz" [...] and [...] "125th Street Congress," [...] as well as the closer, [...] "Non-Stop Home." [...] Other tracks were reminiscent of Weather Report's previous albums. Sweetnighter is considered to be the most stylistically transitional release by the band as it bridged the gap between the more open, improvisational earlier style to a more compositionally structured format. Also, the more prominent use of electric bass is evident here. Zawinul had taken the decision to add some funky beats in the band's sounds, so he recruited drummer Herschel Dwellingham and percussionist Muruga Booker to play on the album. Andrew White was hired to play the English horn, but also handled the bass for three tracks of the album. Sweetnighter was recorded at a Connecticut recording studio in less than a week, and was released in April 1973.|$|E

40|$|The element {{failure of}} digital beam forming array antenna systems used in defence {{equipment}} increases the side lobe power level which distorts the beam {{pattern of the}} antenna array. The problem of array failure correction becomes more complex when null steering conditions are required to be added. In this paper, the problem of linear antenna array failure has been addressed with multiple wide <b>band</b> null <b>steering</b> using firefly algorithm (FA) by controlling the amplitude and phase excitation of array elements. A fitness function {{in the form of}} template has been formulated to obtain the error between original (pre-failed) side lobe pattern and measured side lobe pattern and this error function has been minimized using FA.

40|$|Body {{stiffness}} {{is one of}} is one of {{the characteristics}} of a passenger car affecting the handling, steering and ride comfort characteristics of the vehicle, but so far only limited aspects of mainly steering and handling has been analyzed. In this paper an extensive and detailed analysis of the influence of body stiffness on steering, handling and ride comfort is performed using a combination of laboratory and track testing of a physical prototype as well as sub-system and full vehicle multi-body simulation and finite element analysis. In this study it is found that the on-center, frequency response and primary ride are mostly affected by changes in body stiffness. For example, the torsional stiffness should be increased in order to improve roll balance in ride maneuvers. It is also found that the front and rear lateral stiffness should be raised in order to reduce dead <b>band</b> and <b>steering</b> wheel angle to yaw rate phase lags. Furthermore, maneuvers that combine handling and ride effects are proven to be particularly useful for defining body stiffness targets related to vehicle dynamics effects and one such maneuver is developed and evaluated in this paper. Finally, it is found that the difference between a rigid and flexibly vehicle model can be up to 13 % for certain metrics, meaning that assuming a rigid body can be a significant oversimplification...|$|R

40|$|Meiyu-Baiu is {{the major}} rainy season from central China to Japan brought by a zonal-elongated rain band from June to mid-July. Large-scale {{characteristics}} and environmental forcing of this important phenomenon are investigated based on a reanalysis dataset. The Meiyu-Baiu rain band {{is accompanied by a}} trough of sea-level pressure, horizontal shears and sharp moisture gradients near the surface, a westerly jet tilted northward with height, and large northeastward moisture transport from the south. Our analysis reveals the westerly jet as an important culprit for Meiyu-Baiu. Along the rain band, mean ascending motion corresponds well with a band of warm horizontal temperature advection in the mid-troposphere throughout summer. This adiabatic induction of upward motion originates from the advection of warm air by the westerlies from the eastern flank of the Tibetan Plateau. The ascending motion both induces convection and is enhanced by the resultant condensational heating. The westerly jet anchors the Meiyu-Baiu rain <b>band</b> also by <b>steering</b> transient eddies, creating periods conducive to convection through convective instability and adiabatic updrafts. Indeed in Meiyu-Baiu the probability distribution of convective instability shows large spreads and is strongly skewed, with a sharp cutoff on th...|$|R

The developed LWA operates in the V-band between 50 and 70 GHz {{and has been}} fabricated using standard printed circuit board (PCB) technology. The presented LWA is highly functional and very compact supporting 1 D beam steering and multibeam operation with only a single radio frequency (RF) feeding port. Within the operational 50 – 70 GHz bandwidth, the LWA scans through broadside, providing over 40 ° H-plane beam steering. When operated within the 57 – 66 GHz <b>band,</b> the maximum <b>steering</b> angle is 18. 2 °. The maximum gain of the fabricated LWAs is 15. 4 dBi with only a small gain variation of +/− 1. 5 dB across the operational bandwidth.

For a single user, a maximum wireless on-off keying (OOK) data rate of 2. 5 Gbit/s is demonstrated. Multibeam operation is achieved using the LWA in combination with multiple dense wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) channels and remote optical heterodyning.
