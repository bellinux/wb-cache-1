50|$|The {{regenerative}} {{loop antenna}} can {{consist of a}} tuned signal winding on an open X frame with a feed <b>back</b> <b>winding</b> in close proximity. High effective gain is achieved, for example by placing this feedback winding in the drain circuit of a JFET (junction field effect transistor). An antenna of this type employing vacuum tubes was constructed by Vladimir Zworykin in the 1920s.|$|R

50|$|An {{advanced}} calculation also determines compensation {{points for}} the actual unequal wind conditions {{at the time of}} the jump. These points are added or withdrawn from the original scores of the individual jump according to the wind conditions; when there is <b>back</b> <b>wind,</b> the points are added, and when there is front wind, the points are withdrawn. Wind speed and direction are measured at five different points based on average value, which is determined before every competition.|$|R

A Senate inquiry has recommended increasing regulation for wind farms in response to health concerns, and Prime Minister Tony Abbott recently commented to radio host Alan Jones that his government has managed {{to reduce the number}} of “these things” [wind turbines], but he personally would have preferred “to have reduced the number a whole lot more”. But there’s another solution that would continue to build the capacity of wind energy while removing possible impacts on land-holders: put wind farms out to sea...|$|R

50|$|Robic {{moved to}} Paris In February 1940 {{and became a}} cycle {{mechanic}} for the Sausin company. He started racing but made a poor impression on journalists.

When his name first became known to journalists, he quickly became known as le farfadet de la lande bretonne—the hobgoblin of the Brittany moor. His arrival in the Paris area was not sensational. Robic won a few races out in the villages but this did not mean much. We had hundreds of boys like him in France.|$|R
