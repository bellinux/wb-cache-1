25|$|I thought I {{would write}} Memories and the City in six months, {{but it took}} me one year to complete. And I was working twelve hours a day, just reading and working. My life, because of so many things, was in a crisis; I don’t {{want to go into}} those details: divorce, father dying, {{professional}} problems, problems with this, problems with that, everything was bad. I thought if I were to be weak I would have a depression. But every day I would wake up and have a cold shower and sit down and remember and write, always paying attention to the beauty of the book. Honestly, I may have hurt my mother, my family. My father was dead, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> is still alive. But I can’t care about that; I must care about the beauty of the book.|$|E
500|$|For Thriller 25, The Black Eyed Peas rapper will.i.am remixed the {{demo version}} of [...] "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)". The singer commented on Jackson and the project, [...] "You always just dream of meeting him, let alone working with him. I wouldn't have {{believed}} it. I {{grew up in}} the projects in East Los Angeles and Thriller was filmed about two blocks from my house, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was really strict and she wouldn't {{let me go to the}} factories—she didn't care who was filming a video there; but I'm on the 25th anniversary, 25 years later—that's pretty awesome." [...] Entitled [...] "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing) 2008", the remix was well received by Rolling Stone. The publication described the track, along with [...] "The Girl Is Mine 2008", as being one of the best songs on the album. They noted that will.i.am [...] "updates the songs' original sound to make them dancefloor-worthy twenty-five years after their release".|$|E
2500|$|In December 1946, Vysotsky's parents divorced. In 1947–1949 Vladimir {{lived with}} Semyon Vladimirovich (then an army Major) and his Armenian wife, Yevgenya Stepanovna Liholatova, whom the boy called [...] "aunt Zhenya", at a {{military}} base in Eberswalde in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany (later East Germany). [...] "We decided that our son would stay with me. Vladimir came {{to stay with me}} in January 1947, and my second wife, Yevgenia, became Vladimir's second mother for many years to come. They had much in common and liked each other, which made me really happy," [...] Semyon Vysotsky later remembered. Here living conditions, compared to those of Nina's communal Moscow flat, were infinitely better; the family occupied the whole floor of a two-storeyed house, and the boy had a room to himself {{for the first time in}} his life. In 1949 along with his stepmother Vladimir returned to Moscow. There he joined the 5th class of the Moscow 128th School and settled at , 15 (where they had to themselves two rooms of a four-roomed flat), with [...] "auntie Zhenya" [...] (who was just 28 at the time), a woman of great kindness and warmth whom he later remembered as his second mother. In 1953 Vladimir Vysotsky, now much interested in theater and cinema, joined the Drama courses led by Vladimir Bogomolov. [...] "No one in my family has had anything to do with arts, no actors or directors were there among them. <b>But</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> admired theater and from the earliest age... each and every Saturday I've been taken up with her to watch one play or the other. And all of this, it probably stayed with me," [...] he later reminisced. The same year he received his first ever guitar, a birthday present from Nina Maksimovna; a close friend, bard and a future well-known Soviet pop lyricist Igor Kokhanovsky taught him basic chords. In 1955 Vladimir re-settled into his mother's new home at 1st Meshchanskaya, 76. In June of the same year he graduated from school with five A's.|$|E

60|$|I {{was about}} to speak, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> looked up and I checked the words on my lips.|$|E

6000|$|... “My mother lived there,” {{continued}} Mildred, “until {{she married}} my father.

60|$|I {{would have}} left the room at once, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{prevented}} me. She laid a trembling hand upon my shoulder, and drew me closer to her.|$|E

60|$|I {{shook my}} head.

There was a brief silence, during which Mr. Ravenor sat with his face half turned away from me, resting it lightly upon the long, delicate fingers of his left hand.|$|R
6000|$|Maimie said aghast, 'I can't believe it. You see, {{when you}} went away your mother had none, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> has Tony, and surely they are {{satisfied}} when they have one.' ...|$|E

60|$|Then for {{the first}} time since her malady I saw Philippa blushing! Her long curved eyelashes hid her eyes, which presumably were also pink, <b>but</b> {{certainly}} <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> broad pleasantry had called a tell-tale blush to the cheek of the young person.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{in the end}} she bore me a child, a woman-child, and died. Then I went among <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> people, that {{it might}} nurse at a warm breast and live. <b>But</b> <b>my</b> hands were wet with the blood of men, look you, because of the church, wet with the blood of men. And the Riders of the North came for me, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> brother, who was then chief in his own right, hid me and gave me horses and food. And we went away, my woman-child and I, even to the Hudson Bay Country, where white men were few and the {{questions}} they asked not many.

6000|$|... "Very; <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{would have}} been unhappy if I had stayed away. It is the leaving the poor child that grieves me. She is in a fearful state, between sore throat, starvation, and blows." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{husband had}} to leave me, {{immediately}} after he had placed me in my little house at Nancy, to join the army in Germany under Marshal Guebrian. I lived through that time by {{the help of the}} morning mass, of needlework, and of the Grand Cyrus, which I read through and then began again. My dear husband never failed to send me a courier once a week with letters that were life to me, and sometimes I heard from England; <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> letters were becoming full of anxiety, affairs were looking so ill for the king.|$|R
