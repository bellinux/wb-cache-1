'I'll {{tell you}} what, sir, {{it takes time}} to make up one's mind to such a venture, as my friend the provost calls it; and I was told by Neil Maclean,--who was next file to us, but had the luck to escape the gallows by some sleight-of-hand trick or other,--that, upon my {{breaking}} off, poor Harry stood like one motionless, although all our brethren in captivity made as much tumult as they could, to distract the attention of the soldiers. And run he did at last; but he did not know the ground, and either from confusion, or because he judged the descent altogether perpendicular, he fled up the hill to the left, instead of going down at once, and so was easily pursued and taken. If he had followed my example, he would have found enough among the shepherds to hide him, and feed him, as they did me, on bearmeal scenes and <b>braxy</b> mutton, till better days came round again.' [BRAXY MUTTON.--The flesh of sheep that has died of disease, not by the hand of the butcher. In pastoral countries it is used as food with little scruple.] ...|$|E
60|$|My boy, our {{business}} is not to call hard names, but to take things as we find them, as the Highlandman said when he ate the <b>braxy</b> mutton. Now shall I, because I am your Daddy, tell you what Madam How would not have told you? When you get on board the yacht, you will think it all very pleasant for an hour, {{as long as you}} are in the bay. But presently you will get a little bored, and run about the deck, and disturb people, and want to sit here, there, and everywhere, which I should not like. And when you get beyond that headland, you will find the great rollers coming in from the Atlantic, and the cutter tossing and heaving as you never felt before, under a burning sun. And then my merry little young gentleman will begin to feel a little sick; and then very sick, and more miserable than he ever felt in his life; and wish a thousand times over that he was safe at home, even doing sums in long division; and he will give a great deal of trouble to various kind ladies--which no one has a right to do, if he can help it.|$|E

50|$|<b>Braxy</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} in Europe (particularly in Iceland, Norway and the UK), Australia and the United States.|$|E
50|$|<b>Braxy</b> is an disease {{which causes}} sudden death in sheep. It {{is caused by}} the {{bacterium}} Clostridium septicum.|$|E
50|$|Hamilton {{investigated}} the diseases of sheep <b>braxy</b> and louping ill and {{was chairman of}} the departmental committee on this question appointed by the board of agriculture in 1901, which presented its report in 1906. He confirmed the description of the <b>braxy</b> microbe given in 1888 by Ivar Nielsen and discovered the bacillus of louping ill. He wrote widely on all branches of pathology, especially on the nervous system, tuberculosis, and other diseases of the lungs, and on the healing of wounds. His textbook on pathology (2 vols. 1889-94) was recognised as a standard work.|$|E
50|$|<b>Braxy</b> generallly {{occurs in}} winter, when sheep eat frosted root crops, or frosted grass. The frozen feed damages the mucosa (lining) of the abomasum, {{allowing}} C. septicum to enter, causing abomasitis and a fatal bacteremia.|$|E
5000|$|Young sheep not {{protected}} with a vaccine are most commonly affected. If sheep are not found dead, signs include abdominal pain and recumbency. There is no treatment, and sheep usually die within 36 {{hours of the}} onset of signs. The carcass of sheep which died of <b>braxy</b> will often decompose more rapidly than expected.|$|E
5000|$|Prof John McDougal Russell Greig CBE FRSE (1889-) was a Scottish veterinarian. He was Director of the Moredun Research Institute from 1930 to 1954. He {{is noted}} for the {{development}} of several important animal vaccines: Enzootic abortion in ewes; <b>Braxy</b> and Louping ill. His work on milk effectively created [...] "clean milk" [...] {{for the first time in}} Britain.|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} Moredun {{go back to}} the years {{following}} World War I which saw an increased demand for home grown food and a significant rise in the market value of livestock. This emphasised the seriousness of the losses associated with disease and concerned farmers voiced their strong support for an organised body to conduct research into livestock diseases. In the 1920s Louping Ill and <b>Braxy</b> claimed almost a third of the lambs born in Scotland and Grass Sickness was having a devastating effect on horses, which were used for heavy labour on farms at that time. In March 1920 a group of enlightened Scottish farmers held a public meeting at the Highland and Agricultural Society’s chambers in Edinburgh and the Animal Diseases Research Association (now known as The Moredun Foundation) was formed. Within six years the founder members had raised enough funds to buy a plot of land and build the Moredun Research Institute. Within ten years of the Research Institute opening, Moredun scientists had discovered the cause and developed vaccines and treatment strategies for <b>Braxy</b> and lamb dysentery. Scientists then went on to solve the mystery of Louping Ill which was found to be caused by a virus transmitted by ticks and a vaccine was soon developed.|$|E
