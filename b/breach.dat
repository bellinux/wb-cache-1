5|$|To {{termites}}, any <b>breach</b> {{of their}} tunnels or nests {{is a cause}} for alarm. When termites detect a potential <b>breach,</b> the soldiers usually bang their heads, apparently to attract other soldiers for defence and to recruit additional workers to repair any <b>breach.</b> Additionally, an alarmed termite bumps into other termites which causes them to be alarmed and to leave pheromone trails to the disturbed area, {{which is also a}} way to recruit extra workers.|$|E

5|$|In some species, some {{soldiers}} block tunnels {{to prevent their}} enemies from entering the nest, and they may deliberately rupture themselves {{as an act of}} defence. In cases where the intrusion is coming from a <b>breach</b> that is larger than the soldier's head, defence requires a special formations where soldiers form a phalanx-like formation around the <b>breach</b> and bite at intruders.

5|$|The Arabs now {{launched}} repeated {{attacks on}} the <b>breach,</b> but the defenders held firm. At first, according to al-Tabari, catapults manned by four men each were placed on wheeled platforms, and mobile towers with ten men each were constructed and advanced {{to the edge of}} the moat, which they began to fill with sheep skins (from the animals they had brought along as food) filled with earth. However, the work was uneven due to the soldiers' fear of the Byzantine catapults, and Mu'tasim had to order earth to be thrown over the skins to pave the surface up to the wall itself. A tower was pushed over the filled moat, but became stuck midway and it and the other siege engines had to be abandoned and burned. Another attack on the next day, led by Ashinas, failed due to the narrowness of the <b>breach,</b> and Mu'tasim eventually ordered more catapults brought forward to widen it. The next day Afshin with his troops attacked the <b>breach,</b> and Itakh on the day after. The Byzantine defenders were gradually worn down by the constant assaults, and after about two weeks of siege (the date is variously interpreted as 12, 13 or 15 August by modern writers) Aetios sent an embassy under the city's bishop, offering to surrender Amorium in exchange for safe passage of the inhabitants and garrison, but Mu'tasim refused. The Byzantine commander Boiditzes, however, who was in charge of the <b>breach</b> section, decided to conduct direct negotiations with the caliph on his own, probably intending to betray his own post. He went to the Abbasid camp, leaving orders for his men in the <b>breach</b> to stand down until his return. While Boiditzes parleyed with the caliph, the Arabs came closer to the <b>breach,</b> and at a signal charged and broke into the city. Taken by surprise, the Byzantines' resistance was sporadic: some soldiers barricaded themselves in a monastery and were burned to death, while Aetios with his officers sought refuge in a tower before being forced to surrender.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationships among psychological contract <b>breaches,</b> organizational commitment, and innovation-related behaviors (generating, spreading, implementing innovative ideas at work) over a 6 -month period. Results indicate {{that the effects of}} psychological contract <b>breaches</b> on employees are not static. Specifically, perceptions of psychological contract <b>breaches</b> strengthened over time and were associated with decreased levels of affective commitment over time. Further, increased perceptions of psychological contract <b>breaches</b> were associated with decreases in innovation-related behaviors. We also found evidence that organizational commitment mediates the relationship between psychological contract <b>breaches</b> and innovation-related behaviors. These results highlight the importance of examining the nomological network of psychological contract <b>breaches</b> from a change perspective. © 2010 American Psychological Association. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Grave <b>breaches</b> of the Geneva Conventions are {{one type}} of war crime. In this Article, I argue that the grave <b>breaches</b> regime has three {{possible}} futures. In the first, the regime remains segregated from other categories of war crimes in deference to {{the historical development of}} these crimes. This future, however, is one that will see a relatively dramatic decline in the use of grave <b>breaches</b> in practice, primarily because other offences cover the same acts more efficiently. In the second possible future, the grave <b>breaches</b> are entirely abandoned, but this eventuality seems both improbable and undesirable. Even though judicial pragmatism has diminished aspects of the grave <b>breaches</b> regime that were once unique, grave <b>breaches</b> still offer important features over and above all alternatives. The grave <b>breaches</b> regime is therefore unlikely to disappear entirely. A third possible future involves assimilating the grave <b>breaches</b> with other categories of war crimes, ideally through the promulgation of a more coherent treaty regime. In the short term, this proposition appears politically untenable, leaving judges to unify the stark disparities between grave <b>breaches</b> and other war crimes. A future that continues to adopt this course will nonetheless pose serious problems for the discipline in the years to come. Over the longer term, a treaty creating a more comprehensive code governing all war crimes is therefore inevitable...|$|R
