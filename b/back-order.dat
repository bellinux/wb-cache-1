40|$|Recent {{developments}} in manufacturing technologies {{indicate that the}} adoption of cellular manufacturing technology has been an essential step in improving factory performance and productivity in batch manufacturing industries. For this purpose, however, additional innovative methods are needed to further reduce product cost and lead time and to enhance product quality to help increase market share and profitability. The adoption of the group technology concept allows small batch production to achieve economies {{similar to those of}} mass production while retaining the flexibility of the smaller job shop. In this research, four mathematical models of inventory control within a cellular manufacturing system were developed using a multi-period planning horizon. The objective of Model I is to minimize total manufacturing cost, which includes capital investment cost, machining cost, inventory carrying cost and machine relocation cost under the limitations that inter-cell movement, lost sales and <b>back-ordering</b> are not allowed. The objective of Model II is also to minimize total cost. Inter-cell movement is permitted provided that its cost is minimized. Lost sales and <b>back-ordering</b> are not allowed. The objective of Model III is again to minimize the total cost, while allowing some costs for lost sales and inter-cell movement. <b>Back-ordering</b> is still not allowed. In Model IV the objective is to minimize the total cost, while allowing for the cost of lost sales, inter-cell movement cost and <b>back-ordering</b> cost.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of supply chain has {{to reduce the}} total cost of system, but generally each component of a supply chain tries to find the best policy for its company and consequently tries to find a local optimum. Knowing that the sum of local optimum cannot constitute the global optimum, it is necessary to consider all costs of system simultaneously to find the optimal replenishment policy for all the components of a supply chain. Demand rate of the item is assumed to be a function of time known as ramp type function. Shortages are permitted and partially <b>back-ordered.</b> The <b>back-ordering</b> fraction is taken to be decreasing function of waiting time. We consider inflation and apply discounted cash flow in the problem analysis. Total cost of the system is formulated and optimal replenishment policy is derived, keeping in view the above factors of the system. We use Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the models.

A series about two old high school friends coping with midlife crises, Drescher described the premature plot of the show as [...] "kind of Sex and the City but we ain't getting any!

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the issue of inventory control in a multi-period environment with competition on product availability. Specifically, when a product is out of stock, the customer often must choose between placing a <b>back-order</b> or turning to a competitor selling a similar product. We consider a competition in which customers may switch between two retailers (substitute) {{in the case of}} a stock-out at the retailer of their first choice. In a multi-period setting, the following four situations may arise if the product is out of stock: (i) sales may be lost; (ii) customers may <b>back-order</b> the product with their first-choice retailer; (iii) customers may <b>back-order</b> the product with their second-choice retailer; or (iv) customers may attempt to acquire the product according to some other more complex rule. The question we address is: how do the equilibrium stocking quantities and profits of the retailers depend on the customers 2 ̆ 7 back-ordering behaviors? In this work {{we consider the}} four alternative back-ordering scenarios and formulate each problem as a stochastic multi-period game. Under appropriate conditions, we show that a stationary base-stock inventory policy is a Nash equilibrium of the game that can be found by considering an appropriate static game. We derive conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a policy and conduct a comparative statics analysis. Analytical expressions for the optimality conditions facilitate managerial insights into the effects of various back-ordering mechanisms. Furthermore, we recognize that often a retailer is willing to offer a monetary incentive to induce a customer to <b>back-order</b> instead of going to the competitor. Therefore, it is necessary to coordinate incentive decisions with operational decisions about inventory control. We analyze the impact of incentives to <b>back-order</b> the product on the optimal stocking policies under competition and determine the conditions that guarantee monotonicity of the equilibrium inventory in the amount of the incentive offered. Our analysis also suggests that, counterintuitively, companies might benefit from making their inventories “visible” to competitors 2 ̆ 7 customers, since doing so reduces the level of competition, decreases optimal inventories and simultaneously increases profits for both players...|$|E

30|$|Some more {{researches}} {{have been}} carried out on quantity discount, partial <b>back-ordering,</b> fuzzy environment of inventory system and delay in payments, etc. Widyadana et al. (2011) solved two EOQ models for deteriorating items inventory problems without using derivatives and found these as almost similar to the original model. Taleizadeh et al. (2013) solved a fuzzy rough EOQ model for deteriorating items considering quantity discount and prepayment by using meta-heuristic algorithms. Taleizadeh (2014) established an EOQ model for an evaporating item with partial <b>back-ordering</b> and partial consecutive prepayments. In this model, the retailers are allowed to pay all or a fraction of cost in advance. Thangam (2014) developed a two-level trade credit financing with selling price discount and partial order cancelations under permissible delay in payment. Taleizadeh et al. (2015) developed a production and inventory problem under two scenarios in a three-layer supply chain which involves one distributor, one manufacturer and one retailer. In this model, both defective items and raw materials with imperfect quality are sold at lower prices. Heydari and Norouzinasab (2015) studied a two-level discount inventory model for coordinating a decentralized supply chain considering demand as stochastic and price-sensitive.|$|R
