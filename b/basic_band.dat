40|$|Chara corallina is an {{important}} biological model due to its large internodal cells, the simple shape, and {{the wide range of}} techniques {{that can be used to}} study it. The alternating acidic and <b>basic</b> <b>banding</b> pattern of Chara corallina upon illumination has been studied and well described over the past several decades. However, much of this complex mechanism is not fully understood. Few studies have shown how the acidic and basic regions have responded in real time as lighting conditions change. Utilizing rectangular pulse voltammetry (RPV) and pH-sensitive carbon microelectrodes along the cell wall allows for a real time profile of the banding activity upon removal and subsequent reintroduction of an illumination source. The live current profile obtained reveals aspects of the kinetics and upstream mechanism of each banding region. The acidic bands are shown to be active at a relatively constant level, regardless of light. However, the <b>basic</b> <b>bands</b> appear to be strictly controlled by photosynthesis and, far beyond that of the acidic bands, account for the majority of the pH change in the banding phenomenon. In addition, this data reveals much about the kinetics of the basic region, namely that the time to restart banding takes significantly longer than that to stop. Understanding these rates will lead to a better understanding of the overall mechanism and the unique characteristics of each pH zone...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>band</b> for the Nellcôte {{sessions}} {{consisted of}} Richards, Bobby Keys, Mick Taylor, Charlie Watts, Miller (a skilled drummer {{in his own}} right who covered for the absent Watts on the aforementioned [...] "Happy" [...] and [...] "Shine a Light"), and Jagger when he was available. Wyman did not like the ambience of Richards' villa and sat out many of the French sessions. Although Wyman is credited on only eight songs of the released album, he told Bass Player Magazine that the credits are incorrect and that he actually played on more tracks than that. The other bass parts were credited to Taylor, Richards and session bassist Bill Plummer. Wyman noted in his memoir Stone Alone that there was a division between the band members and associates who freely indulged in drugs (Richards, Miller, Keys, Taylor, engineer Andy Johns) and those who abstained to varying degrees (Wyman, Watts and Jagger).|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a new medium-access control (MAC) protocol for dynamic adjustment of the bandwidth requirement of multimedia applications.

40|$|Abstract. A simple {{model of}} {{interband}} superconductivity, incorporating a <b>basic</b> <b>band</b> and a doping created one (constant {{total number of}} states), is considered, keeping in mind the two-component scenario of high-Tc superconductivity. The dependences of Tc, its isotope exponent, superconductivity gaps, etc. on doping are calculated using an illustrative set of parameters. The observed types of behaviour are reproduced. Diminishing gap ratios with hole doping have been found. In the one-particle excitation spectrum the peak–dip–hump type complex can be identified. In spite of crude approximations the model reflects, in general, the experimental findings on high-Tc cuprates. Two-band models will remain a channel for looking for the high-Tc mechanism. Key words: high-temperature superconductivity, two-band models, doping, gaps. 1...|$|E

40|$|Mono and bilayer {{graphene}} are novel carbon {{materials with}} many remarkable properties.

30|$|In {{order to}} develop MoS 2 {{transistors}} with performance {{comparable to that of}} silicon-based devices, many limitations such as the quality of lattice state, fabrication, and contact resistance between the contact metal and MoS 2 have to be overcome. Many of the previous studies in this context have focused on improving the electrical interaction at the interface of MoS 2 and the metal electrodes. This is because contact-related properties include the potential difference, annealing conditions, and area. However, most of these studies assumed symmetric junctions and did not involve both experimental and theoretical analyses. In addition, it is difficult to analyze the carrier behavior of MoS 2 under gas exposure conditions by only observing its band structure modulation. There is limitation for applying this simulation results because this <b>basic</b> <b>band</b> structure cannot provide any specific value for determining the modulation. Furthermore, although Schottky barrier height (SBH) is believed to be an important factor for determining the electrical response of MoS 2 transistor under gas absorption, the previous studies did not analyze the effect of SBH both theoretically and experimentally.|$|E

40|$|Accurate crop type {{maps are}} {{critical}} for yield estimation and agricultural practices in modern agriculture. A new approach is proposed in this thesis to improve the crop type classification accuracy, by creating a new feature set containing new spectral indices in addition to <b>basic</b> <b>bands.</b> Two types of penalized linear discriminant analysis classifiers are adopted to do the classification, and the cross-validated classification accuracies on the two different feature sets are compared {{to see whether the}} new feature set can improve the crop identification. The result shows with new indices in the feature set the classification mean error rates were decreased substantially for both classifiers (21. 6 % and 25. 2 %). Through analyzing the coefficients retrieved from the best model, the variable importance was assessed. The coefficients are summarized by different bands and images, and the result suggest that red and shortwave infrared are the two bands highly related to the fruit-trees type identification in the study area in Aconcagua valley, Chile. Also late winter to early spring may be the best time to do crop type mapping for these crop types...|$|R
