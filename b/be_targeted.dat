5|$|In small-cell lung {{carcinoma}} (SCLC), {{the cells}} contain dense neurosecretory granules (vesicles containing neuroendocrine hormones), which give this tumor an endocrine/paraneoplastic syndrome association. Most cases {{arise in the}} larger airways (primary and secondary bronchi). Sixty to seventy percent have extensive disease (which cannot <b>be</b> <b>targeted</b> within a single radiation therapy field) at presentation.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{cover system}} allows players to move between cover, to fire blindly, aim freely, and target a {{specific}} enemy. Individual body parts can also <b>be</b> <b>targeted.</b> Melee attacks include additional moves, such as dodging, blocking, disarming an opponent and counter-attacking. Body armour {{can be used}} to absorb gunshots and explosive damage, but is used up in the process. When health is entirely depleted, gameplay stops, and players respawn at the nearest hospital.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} is hunted by {{birds of prey}} {{including}} the boreal owl, short-eared owl, tawny owl, Ural owl, Eurasian eagle-owl, golden eagle, kestrel, common buzzard, red kite, northern goshawk, peregrine falcon, and sparrowhawk. The eggs and chicks may <b>be</b> <b>targeted</b> by cats and corvids, although the adults are fearless in defence of their nests, occasionally even attacking humans. The mistle thrush is not normally a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite.|$|E

5|$|A 2009 {{study of}} tansy beetle {{occupancy}} amongst 1305 patches (stems separated by {{no more than}} 50cm) of the tansy plant {{on the banks of the}} River Ouse (York, UK) intended to establish data on the distribution of tansy plants and relate this to existing tansy beetle populations in order to contribute to the conservation effort of the species. The results were analysed using generalised additive models to conclude that the tansy patches should be managed towards volumes of 3m and that these patches should <b>be</b> <b>targeted</b> within 200m of existing beetle subpopulations on the same river bank in order to help the beetle population disperse and survive.|$|E
5|$|A carnivore, the caracal {{typically}} preys upon small mammals, {{birds and}} rodents. Studies in South Africa {{have reported that}} it preys on the Cape grysbok, the common duiker, sheep, goats, bush vlei rats, rock hyraxes, hare and birds. A study in western India showed that rodents comprise {{a significant portion of}} the diet. They will feed from a variety of sources, but tend to focus on the most abundant one. Grasses and grapes are taken occasionally to clear their immune system and stomach of any parasites. Larger antelopes such as young kudu, bushbuck, impala, mountain reedbuck and springbok may also <b>be</b> <b>targeted.</b> Mammals generally comprise at least 80 percent of the diet. Lizards, snakes and insects are infrequently eaten. They are notorious for attacking livestock, but rarely attack humans.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{concerns}} over the Games, or China's hosting of the Games, had been expressed by various entities, including allegations that China violated its pledge to allow open media access, various alleged human rights violations, its continuous support of repressive regimes (such as Zimbabwe, Myanmar, Sudan and North Korea), air pollution in both the city of Beijing and in neighbouring areas, proposed boycotts, warnings {{of the possibility that}} the Beijing Olympics could <b>be</b> <b>targeted</b> by terrorist groups, disruption from pro-Tibetan protesters, and religious persecutions.|$|E

5|$|Ambassador Bishop clearly {{explained}} his rationale {{to the security}} detail, which was to avoid any impression that they were intervening in the violence in Mogadishu. He feared that the embassy would <b>be</b> <b>targeted</b> by organized attacks if any group involved in the clashes {{got the impression that}} the US was intervening in the conflict. To this effect, he requested the Voice of America and BBC broadcast announcements that the forces were present only to evacuate the embassy and would not interfere in the conflict. The Marines who had been doused in fuel during the refueling were able to take a shower and wash their clothes.|$|E
5|$|Anderson et al. argue that, {{aside from}} acute care, {{emergency}} medicine can {{also play a}} significant role in public health. Vaccinations for many diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis can be administered by emergency departments, patients can <b>be</b> <b>targeted</b> for specific interventions such as counseling for substance abuse, and conditions like hypertension can be detected and treated. Emergency departments are excellent locations to train health care providers and to collect data, because of the high number of patients. Emergency medicine also improves public health by preventing secondary disease developing from an initial presentation (initial symptoms), and it serves as the first line of defense in disaster scenarios.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise {{heads to}} Andoria after Ambassador Soval informs {{them that the}} Vulcans believe they have been {{developing}} Xindi weapon technology. Soval guides Enterprise to a nebula where the Andorian fleet is hiding. Commander Shran is dubious, and abducts and tortures Soval. After believing him, Enterprise joins a fleet of six Andorian ships to intercept the Vulcans. Commander Tucker attempts to buy time by ordering Enterprise directly between the two fleets — this works for a while until Administrator V'Las orders them to <b>be</b> <b>targeted</b> too.|$|E
50|$|Guerrilla warfare can be {{considered}} progressive if it is only enemy combatants that <b>are</b> <b>targeted,</b> but it becomes terrorism when noncombatants <b>are</b> <b>targeted.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2011, the FBI {{reported}} 1,572 {{hate crime}} victims targeted {{based on a}} sexual orientation bias, making up 20.4% of the total hate crimes for that year.

5|$|In April 1996, after {{continued}} Hezbollah rocket {{attacks on}} Israeli civilians, the Israeli armed forces launched Operation Grapes of Wrath, which {{was intended to}} wipe out Hezbollah's base in southern Lebanon. Over 100 Lebanese refugees {{were killed by the}} shelling of a UN base at Qana, in what the Israeli military said was a mistake. Finally, following several days of negotiations, the two sides signed the Grapes of Wrath Understandings on 26 April 1996. A cease-fire was agreed upon between Israel and Hezbollah, which would be effective on 27 April 1996. Both sides agreed that civilians should not <b>be</b> <b>targeted,</b> which meant that Hezbollah would be allowed to continue its military activities against IDF forces inside Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|In {{the field}} map, players may engage the enemy {{as soon as}} they enter Battle Mode, which uses a pausable {{real-time}} combat system, much like Square's Parasite Eve (1998). In Battle Mode, when the player taps the attack button, a spherical grid appears around Ashley. Individual body parts within this sphere can <b>be</b> <b>targeted.</b> The battle system involves the player chaining different attacks known as Chain Abilities to achieve large combos and deal damage to the enemy. This is done by pressing buttons in timely succession, making combat resemble a rhythm game. In addition to Chain Abilities, Defensive Abilities allow Ashley to reduce or reflect damage or avoid status ailments. Ashley also gains Break Arts, which exchange his hit points (HP) for increased damage.|$|E
5|$|Large whales, such as mysticetes, are {{not usually}} subject to predation, but smaller whales, such as monodontids or ziphiids, are. These species are preyed on by the killer whale or orca. To subdue and kill whales, orcas {{continuously}} ram them with their heads; this can sometimes kill bowhead whales, or severely injure them. Other times they corral the narwhals or belugas before striking. They are typically hunted by groups of 10 or fewer orcas, but they are seldom attacked by an individual. Calves are more commonly taken by orcas, but adults can <b>be</b> <b>targeted</b> as well.|$|E
50|$|There {{are more}} than 10 CDK {{inhibitor}} compounds that have gone through or currently ongoing clinical trials, as of 2009. Most of them <b>are</b> <b>targeting</b> multiple CDKs, but some <b>are</b> <b>targeting</b> specific CDKs. For example, P1446A-05 targets CDK4. Various types of cancers including leukemia, melanoma, solid tumors, and other types <b>are</b> being <b>targeted.</b> In some cases, very specific cancer types, such as 'melanoma positive for cyclin D1 expression' <b>are</b> <b>targeted</b> to maximize the efficacy.|$|R
50|$|In recent decades, synagogues have <b>been</b> <b>targeted</b> in {{a number}} of {{terrorist}} attacks. In 2003, the Neve Shalom Synagogue <b>was</b> <b>targeted</b> in a car bombing, killing 21 Turkish Muslims and 6 Jews.|$|R
30|$|In {{the case}} of task-{{difficulty}}, those tasks with high or medium difficulty <b>were</b> <b>targeted</b> {{by an average of}} 75 % of the recommendations, whereas tasks with low difficulty <b>were</b> <b>targeted</b> by the remaining 25 % recommendations. In {{the case of}} resolution time, those tasks requiring high or medium time (more than 20 minutes) <b>were</b> <b>targeted</b> by an average of 80 %, whereas tasks that were quickly solved <b>were</b> <b>targeted</b> by the remaining 20 %. Similar percentages were also observed for the other best performing functions, showing trend in the quality of recommendations, which seems independent of the similarity function chosen.|$|R
5|$|Many {{cultures}} {{throughout history}} have viewed obesity {{as the result}} of a character flaw. The obesus or fat character in Ancient Greek comedy was a glutton and figure of mockery. During Christian times the food was viewed as a gateway to the sins of sloth and lust. In modern Western culture, excess weight is often regarded as unattractive, and obesity is commonly associated with various negative stereotypes. People of all ages can face social stigmatization, and may <b>be</b> <b>targeted</b> by bullies or shunned by their peers.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds {{themselves}} {{are subject to}} predation. Most species are preyed on by the killer whale or orca. To subdue and kill seals, orcas continuously ram them with their heads, slap them with their tails and fling them in the air. They are typically hunted by groups of 10 or fewer whales, but they are occasionally hunted by larger groups or by lone individuals. Pups are more commonly taken by orcas, but adults can <b>be</b> <b>targeted</b> as well. Large sharks are another major predator of pinnipeds—usually the great white shark but also the tiger shark and mako shark. Sharks usually attack by ambushing them from below. The prey usually escapes, and seals are often seen with shark-inflicted wounds. Otariids typically have injuries in the hindquarters, while phocids usually have injuries on the forequarters.|$|E
5|$|The Global Climate Coalition (GCC) {{was formed}} in 1989 as a project {{under the auspices of}} the National Association of Manufacturers. The GCC was formed to {{represent}} the interests of the major producers and users of fossil fuels, to oppose regulation to mitigate global warming, and to challenge the science behind global warming. Context for the founding of the GCC from 1988 included the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and NASA climatologist James Hansen's congressional testimony that climate change was occurring. The government affairs' offices of five or six corporations recognized that they had been inadequately organized for the Montreal Protocol, the international treaty that phased out ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons, and the Clean Air Act in the United States, and recognized that fossil fuels would <b>be</b> <b>targeted</b> for regulation.|$|E

50|$|The only {{difference}} between the 6681 and the 6682 {{is the fact that}} the 6681 <b>is</b> <b>targeted</b> at the European market, being a GSM 900/1800/1900 tri-band handset, while the 6682 <b>is</b> <b>targeted</b> at the American one, supporting 850/1800/1900 frequencies.|$|R
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} pyjama shark as Near Threatened, citing its small {{distribution}} {{and a recent}} increase in fishing pressure on small sharks in the region. However, {{there is no evidence}} to suggest that its population has declined. There are no specific conservation measures in place for this species, though its range encompasses two marine reserves. The South African Sea Fisheries Research Institute is considering legally decommercializing the pyjama shark, which would limit the degree to which it can <b>be</b> <b>targeted</b> by commercial fisheries.|$|E
5|$|The {{orders from}} General der Artillerie (Lieutenant General) Paul Bader, the German Military Commander in Serbia, {{directed}} that Operation Southeast Croatia {{was to be}} an encirclement operation. All persons encountered within the area of operations were {{to be treated as}} the enemy. The population within the area to <b>be</b> <b>targeted</b> by the operation were almost all either Orthodox Serbs or Bosnian Muslims, although there was a small Catholic Croat minority. Bader believed that the Partisans and Chetniks were using the area as winter quarters, and that their presence there was a threat to major transport routes through eastern Bosnia.|$|E
5|$|Although XXBomber Command began {{preparations}} {{to attack}} on Singapore Naval Base again on 6February, this raid was cancelled {{on the third}} of the month by Admiral Louis Mountbatten, the commander of Allied forces in the Southeast Asian theatre. Mountbatten ordered that the naval installations at Singapore and Penang not <b>be</b> <b>targeted</b> as they would be needed by Allied forces following the projected liberation of Malaya and Singapore later in 1945. After requesting clarification of this order, Ramsey met with Mountbatten at Kandy. In this meeting Mountbatten assigned targets in the Kuala Lumpur area as XXBomber Command's first priority, while second priority was given to carefully selected areas of Singapore. These areas excluded the King GeorgeVI Graving Dock and several other docks and areas with heavy machinery, but allowed attacks on the West Wall area of Singapore Naval Base, naval oil stores and commercial dock facilities. Saigon was assigned as XXBomber Command's third priority and fourth priority was given to oil storage dumps on islands near Singapore.|$|E
