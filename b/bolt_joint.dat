Firstly, the dynamic model of the linear rolling guide joint surface is established and its natural frequency is figured out.

40|$|Purpose. Studying of {{influence}} of {{value of a}} backlash on a state of stress of a bolt of a single-shear <b>bolt</b> <b>joint</b> in a "shearing" zone. Methodology. Used a method of final elements and the 3 D contact model {{as much as possible}} approached to real geometry and conditions of load application. Findings. The bolt of a single-shear <b>bolt</b> <b>joint</b> always "works" not only on a shear, and on a bending. Contact interaction of a lateral surface of a bolt with edges of apertures calls in zones of contacts in a bolt additional negative axial stresses of peak character. Even at a cycle with a constant sign on the loading in a bolt at a surface there can be a zone with cyclically sign-variable axial stresses, and they are more destructive, than with a constant sign. It changes character of fatigue failure of a bolt. Originality. The reason of change of character of fatigue failure of a bolt is found out: separation instead of a shear. ????: ???????? ??????? ???????? ?????? ?? ??????????? ????????? ????? ???????????? ????????? ?????????? ? ????

In spite of well-established design rules and assembly procedures, important sources of uncertainty remain {{due to a}} high sensitivity of the joint mechanical behaviour to dispersions (tightening procedure, frictional effects, geometrical tolerances [...] .). Fine scale computations of bolted assemblies accounting for these uncertainties are generally too costly and hardly tractable within an optimization process. Thus, {{a wide range of}} FE connectors or user-elements are usually used or developed in FE commercial code by engineers to propose a simplified model for bolts. The connector behaviour is generally identified from fine scale 3 D computations on an elementary bolded joint and/or from experimental tests. However, identification is often limited to the elastic part of the behaviour and for a given set of loadings and design parameters. In specific situations, simplified analytical models exist but they mainly address linear dynamic or quasistatic problems. In this work, a nonlinear FE connector with its identification methodology is proposed to model the behaviour of a <b>bolt</b> <b>joint.</b> Model parameters are based on design parameters (bolt prestress, friction coefficient, clearance, bolt dimensions [...] .). Axial connector behaviour models the preload effect and the axial bolt stiffness. Tangential connector behaviour accounts for frictional phenomena that occur in the bolt’s vicinity due to preload thanks to an elasto-plastic analogy for friction. Identification of tangential behaviour is performed on a generic elementary single <b>bolt</b> <b>joint.</b> Connector has been developed in SAMCEF through a fortran user-element subroutine.

When under dynamic loading, <b>bolted</b> <b>joints</b> can become loose due to a loss in clamping pressure in the joints. This vibrational loosening sometimes can cause serious problems, and in some cases can lead to fatal consequences if it remains undetected. Non-intrusive ultrasonic and image processing techniques were simultaneously used to investigate the relaxation of contact pressure and loosening of <b>bolted</b> <b>joints</b> subjected to cyclic shear loading. Three critical areas, the contact interface of the bolted component, the bolt length and the rotation of the bolt head, were monitored during loosening of the joints. The results show that loosening of <b>bolted</b> <b>joints</b> can be grouped into three stages: very rapid, rapid, and gradual loosening. The earliest stage of the loosening of <b>bolted</b> <b>joints</b> is characterised by cyclic strain ratcheting–loosening of the <b>bolted</b> <b>joint</b> during vibration without rotation of the bolt head.
