The spectrum characteristics of microseismic signals in different deformation and failure stages of the concrete beam are analyzed, and the identification method of the fracture stages and crack propagation precursors of concrete beam is established. Meanwhile, the Realistic Failure Process Analysis code (RFPA) is adopted to simulate and analyze the entire failure processes of concrete beam from its cracks initiation, development, propagation, and coalescence, until macroscopic fractures formation subjected to three-point bending test. The relation curve of the load, loaded displacement, and acoustic emission (AE) of concrete beam in the three-point bending test is also obtained. It is found that the failure characteristics of concrete beam obtained from numerical experiments agree well with the field physical test results. The heterogeneity of concrete is the major cause of zigzag propagation paths of beam cracks subjected to three-point bending tests.

Roller bent wide flange sections are manufactured from straight hot-rolled wide flange sections by a process called <b>roller</b> <b>bending.</b> The material is cold worked during forming, inducing a new distribution of mechanical properties across the section which is different compared to its original state.

40|$|Cold <b>roller</b> <b>bending</b> is {{commonly}} used for bending straight members with hot rolled wide-flange sections to create arches. This process induces plastic deformations along the member, {{so that it can}} acquire the desired curvature. The resulting residual stress distribution is different from the well-known residual stress pattern due to hot rolling. Extensive {{studies have shown that the}} influence of residual stresses due to hot rolling on the resistance of wide-flange steel sections is non negligible. On the contrary, the residual stress pattern due to <b>roller</b> <b>bending</b> has been only recently clearly identified and its effects on the elasto-plastic behavior of curved members have not been studied sufficiently. Thus, in this paper the influence of such residual stresses on the resistance of both wide-flange sections and corresponding arch members is investigated in detail. Taking into consideration the residual stress pattern due to cold bending, interaction diagrams are developed for combined axial load and bending moment, as well as buckling curves for cold bent steel arches. The results are quantified and compared with those for hot-rolled and stress free members. This will allow designers to appreciate the available margins of safety when using standard residual stress pattern for cold bent members. Furthermore, the results suggest the necessity for the development of buckling curves for curved members including initial imperfections...|$|R

Upgrading the bumper becomes a necessity as the mini 4WD is modified to run faster than what the stock kit usually runs. The faster the car, the more the car needs down force to counter the decrease in stability. The stock chassis+bumper combination does have a tendency to <b>bend,</b> causing the <b>rollers</b> to run at angles and may make the mini 4WD fly off the course.

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} process of structural wide flange steel sections introduces residual stresses in the material. These stresses due to hot-rolling or welding influence the inelastic buckling response of structural steel members {{and need to}} be taken into account in the design. Based on experimental data standardized residual stress models have been proposed for inclusion in inelastic buckling analyses. By incorporating these residual stress models their effect on the resistance of beams and columns can be obtained. Residual stress models for roller bent steel sections are currently not available. Roller bent wide flange sections are manufactured by curving straight members at ambient temperature. This manufacturing technique, which is also known as <b>roller</b> <b>bending,</b> stresses the material beyond its yield stress, thereby overriding the initial residual stresses prior to bending and generating an entirely new pattern. This paper proposes a residual stress model for roller bent wide flange sections, based on earlier conducted numerical investigations which were validated by experimental research performed at Eindhoven University of Technology. The proposed residual stress model can serve as an initial state of a roller bent steel section in fully non-linear finite element analyses to accurately predict its influence on the inelastic buckling response...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a numerical {{investigation into the}} out-of-plane buckling behavior of freestanding roller bent steel arches. As roller bent arches have structural imperfections which differ considerably from those of hot-rolled or welded sections, {{specific attention is paid}} to their inclusion in the numerical model. Sensitivity analyses are performed to assess the influence of the imperfections due to <b>roller</b> <b>bending</b> on the out-of-plane buckling response. The accuracy of the finite element model is checked by comparing the results with earlier performed experiments as presented in a related paper. The finite element model is able to replicate the structural behavior displayed by the experiments with good accuracy. A database is created with elastic– plastic buckling loads for a large number of freestanding roller bent arches. The numerical data is analyzed and presented in a so-called imperfection parameter diagram from which imperfection parameter curves are derived. The imperfection parameter curves are substituted into the European column curve formulation, leaving the original column curve formulation unaffected but extending its applicability to the out-of-plane buckling response of roller bent arches. The column curve with proposed imperfection parameter expressions can be used to check the out-of-plane buckling response of a roller bent steel arch with known non-dimensional slenderness. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Steel arches {{are used}} {{more and more}} in {{contemporary}} architecture, combining structural efficiency with architectural merits. If lateral supports are absent, these arches are prone to out-of-plane buckling. Arches are often made by cold bending wide flange beams at ambient temperature. This manufacturing technique, also known as the <b>roller</b> <b>bending</b> process, induces changes in residual stresses, mechanical properties and geometric imperfections. This paper addresses the out-of-plane buckling of freestanding roller bent wide flange arches. A shell model is created with the commercial finite element code ANSYS v. 11. 0, incorporating material non-linearities, residual stresses and geometric imperfections to investigate the out-of-plane elastic-plastic buckling response. The finite element model is validated against earlier performed experimental tests on freestanding arches. Sensitivity analyses are performed to assess the influence of the imperfections. The results were plotted in column curve graphs to show the influence of imperfections with respect to the non-dimensional slenderness of the arch. It is shown that the residual stresses have a limited influence, but the presence of geometric imperfections and altered non-linear material properties have significant influence on the elastic-plastic buckling load. In addition it was concluded that the current column curves in EC 3 can be adapted to include the elastic-plastic buckling behavior of freestanding roller bent arches...|$|R

Original equipment manufacturers (OEM) provide the machine capacity chart based on reference material considering perfectly plastic material model. Reported work shows the bendability analysis of heavy duty 3 -roller plate bending machine. The input variables for the industry are plate thickness, shell diameter and material property parameters, as it is fixed by the design. Analytical models of equivalent thickness, equivalent width and maximum width based on power law material model were derived to study the bendability. Equation of maximum width provides bendability for designed configuration i. e. material property, shell diameter and thickness combinations within the machine limitations.
