40|$|Insulated {{rail joints}} are a safety valve in {{railways}} {{that are used}} {{as part of the}} signalling system to determine the position of a train. Insulated rail joints are the weakest part of the railroad, where their life ranges between a third and half of the life of rails. One of the most significant issues in insulated rail joints is metal flow, and damage and loss of the end post. Major causes of these issues include sliding wear, impact wear, wear due to rolling/sliding contact, and wear due to rail compression and plastic flow of rail material. In this study experimental investigations have been applied to improve insulated rail joints. The aim of this work was to experimentally determine the resistance to sliding wear, impact wear, rolling/sliding contact wear, compression wear of five specimens of end post materials with different properties against train wheel material (steel), and the influence of tests parameters and lubrication on these materials.

40|$|The {{present study}} about the {{behaviour}} of plain textiles {{used for the}} production of antimis (Christian-orthodox liturgical item used in the liturgy) to pilling explores the functional classification of different types of antimis as a textile product made out the following different types of fabrics: natural silk, flax, viscose, polyamide 6. 6. Pilling is a phenomenon which consists of the formation of small balls made out of fibre congeries on the textile’s surface due to attrition and fatigue. For textiles used as liturgical items, the process of pilling formation includes the following stages: the emergence of the pilling surfaces (the formation of fuzzy), fibre tangle (appearance of small balls), and the detachment of small balls from the fabric’s surface. The analysis method of pilling for liturgical items made out the four types of fabrics mentioned above consists of stereoscopic microscopy techniques and electronic microscopy methods (SEM). The images of textiles samples (yarns and fabrics) will be captured using a video microscope. Quantitative tests have been done to determine the metric number and the tex title of the above-mentioned fabrics. The increased resistance of silk to pilling compared to nylon, flax, and viscose {{can be attributed to the}} chemical properties of fibres and structural characteristics of silk fabric.

The final publication is available at Springer via [URL] bonding is the fastest and the cheapest technique for manufacturing nonwovens. Understanding mechanical behaviour of these materials, especially related to damage, can aid in design of products containing nonwoven parts. A finite element (FE) model incorporating mechanical properties related to damage such as maximum stress and strain at failure of fabric’s fibres would be a powerful design and optimisation tool. In this study, polypropylene-based thermally bonded nonwovens manufactured at optimal processing conditions were used as a model system. A damage behaviour of the nonwoven fabric is governed by its single-fibre properties, which are obtained by conducting tensile tests over a wide range of strain rates. The fibres for the tests were extracted from the nonwoven fabric in a way that a single bond point was attached at both ends of each fibre. Additionally, similar tests were performed on unprocessed fibres, which form the nonwoven. Those experiments not only provided insight into damage mechanisms of fibres in thermally bonded nonwovens but also demonstrated a significant drop in magnitudes of failure stress and respective strain in fibres due to the bonding process. A novel technique was introduced in this study to develop damage criteria based on the deformation and fracture behaviour of a single fibre in a thermally bonded nonwoven fabric. The damage behaviour of a fibrous network within the thermally <b>bonded</b> <b>fabric</b> was simulated with a FE model consisting of a number of fibres attached to two neighbouring bond points. Additionally, various arrangements of fibres’ orientation and material properties were implemented in the model to analyse the respective effects...|$|E
40|$|The load {{elongation}} behaviour of geotextiles is decisively {{influenced by the}} surrounding soil. This influence on behaviour has previously been quantifiable only insufficiently and cannot therefore be used in current dimensioning procedures. This uncertainty leads to low coefficients of utilisation of the geotextiles in the dimensioning procedures and thus to constructions which cannot be evaluated in terms of safety and which are often not economical. With the laboratory tests 'lateral pressure device' and 'transverse force introduction', the bond behaviour of geotextiles with the surrounding soil was realistically simulated and studied. These tests provided input parameters for calculations using the finite element method (FEM). Lateral pressure devices were used to study the {{load elongation}} behaviour of geotextiles in contact with soil. These test devices {{make it possible to}} apply a tensile load to the geotextiles in the soil. The geotextile sample is fastened on two clamps; one end is held in place. At the other end the tensile force is introduced. Vertically to the geotextile level, soil layers and compressed air bellows are installed. These compressed air bellows are used to simulate the load in the construction. In the tests, various geotextile products (mechanically bonded fabrics, thermally <b>bonded</b> <b>fabric,</b> woven textile) were studied. Two different types of soil (fine gravel and coarse clay) were used. The influence of the type of soil and the soil load on the load elongation behaviour were studied. The tests showed that the deformation behaviour of the geotextiles studies is decisively characterised by the soil. The deformation module of the geotextile samples is clearly higher in the bond with the soil than in the tests without contact to the soil. This is caused by the transmission of transverse strain between soil and geotextile and by the dispersion of soil particles {{in the structure of the}} geotextiles. Thus an inner bond arises. The raw material of the geotextiles had a clear influence on the deformation behaviour. The tests showed that exceptional suitability of polyester as a reinforcement material. The transverse movement test is a modified shear test in which a geotextile reinforcement is also installed in addition to the soil material. The reinforcement is perpendicular arranged in relation to the shear joint. This test construction is used to simulate the behaviour of the geotextile/soil/bond system in the proximity of the fracture joint in reinforced steep slopes which is formed when the shear strength of the soil material is exceeded. The deformation of the geotextile which occurs under this transverse force load causes an increase in the resistance to shearing and thus an increase of the ultimate load of these bond systems. On the basis of the results of this research study, it is possible to give a plausible explanation for the good success with geotextiles as reinforcement of earthworks. This success could not be comprehended, in particular for the non wovens, from the tests without soil, the results of which are included in the current dimensioning approaches. The results of this research study can, therefore, serve as the basis for a dimensioning approach which realistically records the influence of the soil and the deformations of the bond system.

We choose the triaxial tensile strength as a macroscopic representation of the inter-particle <b>bonding,</b> and a <b>fabric</b> tensor to characterize the fabric in sand. The yield function adopted in the model is an extension of a recently developed anisotropic failure criterion, with the frictional parameter therein being replaced by a proper hardening parameter. A de-bonding law is proposed by assuming the de-bonding process is driven by the development of plastic deformation. The soil fabric is kept constant in the study to account for inherent anisotropy. Relevant model parameters can be conveniently calibrated by conventional laboratory tests. The model is employed to predict the behavior of cemented Ottawa sand and multiple-sieving-pluviated Toyoura sand, and the predictions compare well with the experimental data. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

Fabric Reinforced Cementitious Matrix (FRCM) is a composite material specifically designed for masonry and concrete rehabilitation and is becoming {{a viable alternative to}} FRP, whenever the project conditions do not allow the use of organic polymer based composites. FRCM is usually constituted by one or multiple plies of dry fabrics (carbon, glass, aramid, basalt or PBO fibers) embedded into an inorganic matrix.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{discussion}} of a manufacturing technique that reduces dependency on in-plane resin flow, allowing greatly reduced injection times, increased injected resin volume per port (reducing the number of ports required), and allows relatively higher fiber volume content. This method uses a two-stage injection process. The first stage injects resin into a vacuum evacuated “pool ” outside of {{the plane of the}} fabric. Pressure is then applied outside of a flexible film, forcing resin into the fabric in the thickness direction. Since resin is not required to flow in the plane of the fabric, relatively high volumetric flow rates are possible during the injection stage. The hydrostatic pressure on the flexible film results in part-to-part and spatially consistent high volume content. This process has also shown to be less sensitive to fabric and manufacturing inconsistencies than traditional two-sided mold RTM, and has been used to successfully manufacture parts using difficult-to-RTM materials such as <b>bonded</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Drawbacks of this process include increased mold and process complexities, poor surface finish {{on one side of the}} part, and increased complexity of process tuning...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{influence}} of <b>bonding</b> and soil <b>fabric,</b> the behavior of a natural soil differs significantly from that of a remolded soil. It has been found that a soil with bonding may exhibit enhanced soil strength, stiffness as well as brittleness, and the soil fabric may lead to anisotropic soil behavior. A general failure criterion and constitutive framework considering both aspects of natural soils is of significant importance for practical analysis and design of geo-structures. In this paper, we first employ an anisotropic failure criterion to characterize the peak strength of cemented sands and natural clays. By replacing the constant frictional parameter with a hardening parameter, the anisotropic failure criterion is then modified to be a yield function, based on which a constitutive model is proposed to describe the effect of <b>bonding</b> and <b>fabric</b> anisotropy on the behavior of naturally bonded soil.

The length of the diol chain has major influence to the material's properties; with increasing diol chain length the melting point increases, the crystallization rate increases, and the degree of crystallization decreases. Both the diol and acid influence the melting point. In comparison with similar polyamides, due to absence of hydrogen bonds, polyesters have lower strength and melting point, but are much more resistant to moisture, though still susceptible. In other parameters, and in applications where these factors do not play a role, polyesters and polyamides are very similar. Polyesters are often used for <b>bonding</b> <b>fabrics.</b> They can be used on their own, or blended with large amounts of additives.

Water-dispersible amorphous polymers, modified by addition of sodium sulfonate groups for dispersability, were however developed for repulpable adhesives.

We experimented with four mechanical properties and thicknesses of twenty-three specimens of interlining <b>bonded</b> <b>fabrics</b> including face fabrics and interlinings by using the KES-FB-AUTO system. The results showed that the tensile property increased(LT and RT increased and WT decreased) as the denier of the interlining increased; however, the change was slight. In contrast, the bending and shear properties increased significantly as the denier of the interlining increased on both the warp and the weft. This showed evidence that the interlining gives the fabrics size stability. The compression property was slight changed as the tensile property varies depending on the fibers and the denier of interlining. As expected, the thickness increased by bonding the interlining as the denier of interlining increased.

Liquid moulding processes, where the reinforcement is prepared separately from the moulding operation, have been suggested as a suitable production method.

Whilst forming the preform, defects such as wrinkling and tearing can occur which can prevent successful moulding. This thesis addresses problems {{in the design and}} production of preforms.

The results from the in-plane shear tests were compared with those from the grid strain analysis to determine which fabric variables were important to fabric formability.
