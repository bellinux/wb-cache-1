40|$|The work {{is aimed}} at the {{studying}} the composition {{and structure of the}} <b>bloody-nosed</b> <b>beetles</b> fauna of the North Caucasus, at revealing the laws of its geographical and lanscape distribution, trophic connections with planst and at establishing the peculiarities of formation of the <b>bloody-nosed</b> <b>beetles</b> complexes in the natural and anthropogenous ecosystems. The zoogeographic fauna structure has been studied, the law of the vertically-zone distribution has been revealed, the composition of the ecological groups has been determined by the biotopic preferendum, first the analysis of the trophic connections of all <b>bloody-nosed</b> <b>beetles</b> of the North Caucasus has been performed. The peculiarities of formation of the agrocenoses <b>bloody-nosed</b> <b>beetles</b> fauna have been revealed, the ways and causes of transition from the natural into the anthropogenous ecosystems have been shown. The data about the taxonomic composition of the <b>bloody-nosed</b> <b>beetles</b> of the North Caucasus have been received. 415 species and 26 subspecies of the <b>bloody-nosed</b> <b>beetles</b> have been revealed, including 34 species to be noted first for a given regionAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R

Recorded as plentiful on this site is the <b>bloody-nosed</b> <b>beetle.</b> The snail (Helicella itala) is seen, and the rare green spider (Micromatta virescens).|$|E
