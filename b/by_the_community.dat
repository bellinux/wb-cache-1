5|$|As 30% of the {{upgrading}} cost {{had to be}} paid <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> club, several fundraising {{activities were}} carried out for the redevelopment. These activities, which included music concerts, golf tournaments and cyclethons, raised a total of S$6 million. The old club building was demolished in 1997 and construction of the Marine Parade Community Building began the same year. SAL Construction was the project's main contractor. Built {{at a cost of}} S$30 million, the new building was completed in January 2000, and was open to the public on 6 March 2000. It was officially opened by Goh Chok Tong on 28 May 2000.|$|E

5|$|As the freeholders {{shared the}} mineral royalties, the mines brought {{prosperity}} which {{gave rise to}} the remodelling and redevelopment of much of the village. Green Terrace, which includes the old post office, was built in the 1870s, and Main Street was transformed from a back lane into the high street. The village school, with working clock and bell tower, was built <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> in 1874, and the stone-built Ibbotson Institute, now the community hall, was completed in 1903.|$|E
5|$|Lying {{within the}} {{historic}} county boundaries of Lancashire {{since the early}} 12th century, Royton anciently constituted a thegnage estate, held by tenants who paid tax to the King. Royton during the Middle Ages formed a township in the parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham, and hundred of Salford. Anciently, law and order was upheld in the locality by two constables, chosen <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> and appointed annually by Vestry meetings.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of coal <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> {{in the early}} 19th century {{paved the way for}} the Youngstown area's inclusion on the network of the famed Erie Canal. The Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal Company was organized in 1835, and the canal was completed in 1840. Local industrialist David Tod, who was later Ohio governor during the Civil War, persuaded Lake Erie steamboat owners that coal mined in the Mahoning Valley could fuel their vessels if canal transportation were available between Youngstown and Cleveland. The arrival of the railroad in 1856 smoothed the path for further economic growth.|$|E

5|$|Because {{remarriage}} {{was often}} {{thought to be}} a sacrilege—common belief (contrary to the Gospel – Luke 20:27–40 and Matthew 22:29–30) was that the sacrament of marriage extended beyond death—it was censured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>community.</b> Thus the purpose of the Bal des Ardents was twofold: to entertain the court and to humiliate and rebuke Isabeau's lady-in-waiting—in an inherently pagan manner, which the Monk of St Denis seemed to dislike. A ritual burning on the wedding night of a woman who was remarrying had Christian origins as well, according to Veenstra. The Book of Tobit partly concerns a woman who had seven husbands murdered by the demon Asmodeus; she is eventually freed of the demon by the burning of the heart and liver of a fish.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{destruction}} of the Quino checkerspot butterfly were raised <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> group Preserve South Bay. That group sued the developer as well as Caltrans and SANDAG in August 1999, following the latter's approval for the project. Early the next year, an environmental impact report suggested that Bonita might face negative effects from the freeway, such as noise and having the roadway divide the community. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) allowed the project that year, even though the Environmental Protection Agency objected to it. A contractor for the project was soon retained by California Transportation Ventures. Another group, Citizens for 125, obtained 7,000 signatures in support of the road.|$|E
5|$|From its {{inception}} in 1973 until 1984, the restaurant was co-owned by Byron and Virginia Hardin. Their son, Mike Hardin, became co-owner when his father died in 1984. He assumed greater responsibility with business partner Terry Rhodes when his mother died in 1989. Mike Hardin was called a local icon by Discover San Diego and the San Diego Union-Tribune.Mike Hardin died on February 5, 2015, having {{suffered a heart attack}} and a makeshift memorial for was created <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> in front of the Ocean Beach restaurant.

Hundreds of people attended a public memorial ceremony in late March at the Petco's Park location, including Guy Fieri. His son Shane and daughter Lexi became co-owners of the restaurant chain in 2015. In an interview with SD News, Shane discussed the pressures of taking over the business as well as both modeling his behavior after his father and establishing his own identity as its owner.|$|E

5|$|Highway {{construction}} in the mid-1930s further altered the park. The first of these proposals was the Grand Concourse Extension, later the Mosholu Parkway Extension, which was already being paved in 1934, when Robert Moses became Parks Commissioner. Moses immediately started planning for the Henry Hudson Parkway, which was originally envisioned {{as an extension of}} Riverside Drive. As proposed, the parkway would have only skirted the park's northwest corner in order to connect with the Saw Mill River Parkway in Westchester. However, due to that plan's high cost, the route was amended and the Henry Hudson Parkway became an extension of the West Side Elevated Highway, cutting straight through the park to intersect with the Saw Mill River Parkway. Unlike the Concourse extension, the Henry Hudson Parkway was minimally opposed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>community,</b> as it was widely seen as an improvement. Work on the parkway began in 1935.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, Valve {{announced}} that the entirety of Dota 2 would be ported over to their Source 2 game engine in an update called Dota 2 Reborn, making Dota 2 the first game to use the engine. Reborn was first {{released to the public}} as a beta update that same month, and officially replaced the original client in September 2015. Reborn included a new user interface framework design, ability for custom game modes created <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>community,</b> and the full replacement of the original Source engine with Source 2. Largely attributed to technical difficulties players experienced with the update, the global player base experienced a sharp drop of approximately sixteen percent the month following the release of Reborn. However, after various updates and patches, over a million concurrent players were playing again by the beginning of 2016, with that being the largest amount of users in nearly a year. The move to Source 2 also allowed the use of the Vulkan graphics API, which was released as an optional feature in May 2016, making Dota 2 one of the first games to offer it.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} built in 1913 {{on the site}} of a local college's recreation ground and was significantly redeveloped twice. The first reconstruction came in the 1930s from which the Art Deco East and West Stands date. There was a second development; the first phase was completed in 1989 which added executive boxes to the Clock End, and afterwards in 1993 a new North Bank Stand was constructed, both following the recommendations of the Taylor Report which replaced the terraces to make the stadium an all-seater with four stands. However, further attempts to expand the stadium were blocked <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>community,</b> and the resulting reduction in capacity and matchday revenue eventually led to Arsenal opting to build a new stadium, to become known as the Emirates Stadium in nearby Islington. After the club moved to their new stadium upon the conclusion of the 2005–2006 season, Highbury was redeveloped as a residential development known as Highbury Square, with the Clock End and North Bank stands being demolished; parts of the East and West Stands remained and were incorporated into the new development due to their listed status.|$|E

5|$|On the way home, Peter and Brian argue until Brian {{gets out}} of the car. A police officer gives Brian a ticket, for which Peter has to pay $10, for violating the local leash law, which only widens the rift between Peter and Brian. Another {{argument}} ensues and Peter mentions that he found Brian on the road as a stray dog. Angry that Peter brought that up and becoming more angry when Peter then demands that Brian stop being a bad dog, Brian leaves the house, whereupon he is treated cruelly <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>community,</b> and is (ultimately) forced to sleep at the bus shelter. Peter buys a new cat which turns out to be mischievous and abusive; the family gets rid of it and searches for Brian. By the time Peter decides to apologize to Brian, Brian has been kicked out of a restaurant and a public store and chased by the police when he was found drinking from a water fountain. Brian becomes homeless, having actually attacked a man on the street for treating him as a drunken hobo and for not believing that he was not a good dog but a crazy animal. He is subsequently taken away by the police.|$|E
5|$|The Community Committee may {{reject a}} {{community}} declaration {{on the ground}} that, among other things, the declarant did not apply for a COE. During a reserved election, a declaration must also be rejected if the declarant does not state {{that he or she}} considers himself or herself {{to be a member of}} the community to which the election is reserved. In the 2017 election which was reserved to the Malay community, the Community Committee rejected two declarations, one from a declarant who stated he belonged to the Chinese community, and one from a declarant who said he was not a member of either the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities.

5|$|The Restless Spirit is a 1913 American silent short drama film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Allan Dwan, featuring J. Warren Kerrigan and Pauline Bush. The film is based on Thomas Gray's 1751 poem, Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, and {{tells the story of a}} man who wishes to be a conqueror. The Dreamer heads out into the desert and is nursed back to health by the Desert Flower. A series of illusions follows which shows the futility of conquest when he cannot conquer his own community. He returns and eventually becomes respected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> that once ridiculed him. The film makes use of numerous dissolves which were technically difficult to execute, and reportedly sent the cameraman to the hospital due to stress. The film may have been the last unbilled appearance by Lon Chaney, and was released on October 27, 1913 by Universal Film Manufacturing Company under the Victor label. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
