5|$|Aang's {{character}} was developed from a drawing by Bryan Konietzko, depicting a <b>bald</b> <b>man</b> with an arrowlike design on his head, {{which the artist}} developed into {{a picture of a}} child with a flying bison. Meanwhile, Michael Dante DiMartino was interested in a documentary about explorers trapped in the South Pole, which he later combined with Konietzko's drawing.|$|E
5|$|In {{their shared}} hotel room Walter keeps Peter awake by reciting the {{chemical}} formula for root beer. The next morning Peter expresses his unhappiness with the arrangement to Olivia (Anna Torv) and tells her {{he wants to}} leave. She can't let him do that, telling him that Walter refuses to work without him. The Fringe Team investigates the object that arrived in Brooklyn, a cylinder that is determined to vibrate at a particular frequency. In {{the course of the}} investigation, Walter assaults and forcibly sedates Junior Agent Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) in order to hide the cylinder. He later meets with the <b>bald</b> <b>man</b> at a diner.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have been}} {{inconsistent}} and not stable across cultures how <b>balding</b> <b>men</b> rate on the attraction scale.

Thrud first encounters To-Me Ku-Pa in an early White Dwarf strip and is turned into a frog. Subsequently, in The Three Tasks of Thrud, To-Me Ku-Pa takes advantage of Thrud's drugged state, following Lymara's failed assassination attempt, to hypnotise him and force him to obtain three items necessary for a spell.|$|E
5|$|The song's music video, {{directed}} by Nick Brandt, and shot in Los Angeles, is focused around six unrelated {{people living in}} isolation in a cityscape on a dark, cloudy day {{while the rest of}} the world moves around them in slow motion. The first half of the video introduces these figures. Five of the figures are: a <b>bald</b> <b>man</b> looking down at the city from his apartment window, a middle-aged woman sitting alone in a coffee shop, a homeless man lying on the damp street, a well-dressed figure feeding pigeons, and a teenage boy ostracized from a game of baseball. The sixth figure is Jackson himself, seen walking the city streets while he sings. Special effects are used to show birds and wasps flying, glass breaking and coffee spilling, all in slow motion.|$|E

25|$|The next leg of {{the journey}} takes the prince into a deep forest {{inhabited}} by the evil Spânul, or <b>Bald</b> <b>Man.</b> There follow three consecutive encounters between the protagonist and the Bald Man: after twice refusing the latter's insidious offer of services, the prince is eventually forced by dire circumstance into accepting it. After another elaborate deception, the creature is able to trap the prince into a well, and only leaves him out in exchange for swearing on his backsword that they would exchange roles: the <b>Bald</b> <b>Man</b> will be introduced as the king's son to his uncle, while the young man will become a slave {{under the name of}} Harap Alb. They proceed to the Green Emperor's palace, who innocently welcomes the <b>Bald</b> <b>Man</b> as his son. During the meeting, the master makes a point of mistreating and hitting his slave. This upsets the emperor's daughter, who asks him to behave with more reserve, and secretly begins to wonder about his actual identity.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Creangă's {{story was}} {{subjected}} to a Postmodern interpretation, with Stelian Ţurlea's novel Relatare despre Harap Alb ("A Report about Harap Alb"). The plot devices separating it from the original include locating the events in various real locations (from South America to the Arctic Ocean), hidden quotation from classical writers such as François Rabelais, William Shakespeare and Pierre Corneille, and depictions of the <b>Bald</b> <b>Man</b> as a Machiavellian character (in the negative sense) and of the Green Emperor as revered Moldavian Prince Stephen the Great. A new stage adaptation of the original tale, directed by Cornel Todea {{to the music of}} Nicu Alifantis, premiered in 2005 at Bucharest's Ion Creangă Children's Theater.|$|E
500|$|At a diner in Brooklyn, New York, a <b>bald</b> <b>man</b> with no eyebrows {{sits down}} at a table and orders a raw roast beef {{sandwich}} with eleven jalapeño peppers {{and a glass of}} room temperature water. When the sandwich arrives, he drowns it in Tabasco sauce and black pepper and wolfs it down in large, quick bites, to the bemusement of the diner staff. During this time he is also watching the construction site across the street through high-tech binoculars and taking notes from right to left in unrecognizable characters. The ground shakes and a gas main explodes at the site, toppling a crane. The bald man—the Observer—calmly pays for his sandwich and wanders to the gaping hole where the construction site was. On a wireless phone, he says [...] "It has arrived." ...|$|E

500|$|The tale {{builds on}} {{intricate}} symbolism stemming from obscure sources. It features what Muguraș Constantinescu calls [...] "the most complex representation of Holy Sunday", with mention of her isolated and heavenly abode on [...] "flower island". A background antithesis opposes the two fictional monarchs, with the Red Emperor replicating an ancient tradition which attributes malignant characteristics to the color. By contrast, the Green Emperor probably illustrates {{the ideals of}} vitality and healthy lifestyle, as hinted by his culinary preference for [...] "lettuce from the garden of the bear". Historian Adrian Majuru, building on earlier observations made by linguist Lazăr Șăineanu, also connects the servant-prince's antagonists with various reflections of ethnic strife in Romanian folklore: the Red Emperor as standing for the medieval Khazars ("Red Jews"), the <b>Bald</b> <b>Man</b> as a popular view of the Tatars.|$|E
500|$|Kevin is {{abducted}} by a strange-looking <b>bald</b> <b>man.</b> Kevin's mother recognizes the man's description {{as that of}} Owen Jarvis, who had done yard work for {{the family in the}} past. Owen claims to be Kevin's guardian angel. As the agents arrive, Kevin mysteriously disappears. Owen claims he was asked by God to protect Kevin and criticizes Scully for her faith not being as strong as his. Owen jumps out the window and escapes. Kevin arrives at his home and is pursued by Gates, who kills Owen when he arrives to protect Kevin. Scully performs an autopsy and finds that Owen's corpse is not decaying, reminding her of [...] "incorruptibles" [...] that she learned about in Catechism. Mulder tells Scully to not let her faith cloud her judgment. Scully finds that handprints on Owen's neck belong to Simon Gates, a rich and powerful executive.|$|E
500|$|After being {{hospitalized for}} his injuries, Peter admits to Olivia that his {{experience}} with The Observer has caused him to start to believe in The Pattern. Peter decides {{that he wants to}} stay with the Fringe team until he gets some explanations. Walter apologizes to Astrid, who doesn't yet forgive him. Walter admits to Peter that, during an accident many years ago, a mysterious third party saved both their lives. The man was bald and had no eyebrows, who [...] "knew my [...] thoughts before I did." [...] Walter admits that his behaviour regarding the capsule, and his desire to protect it, was motivated by his debt to this <b>bald</b> <b>man,</b> and that the capsule somehow contained instructions from this man. At the end of the episode, Olivia returns home, and sees recently deceased lover John Scott (Mark Valley) in her kitchen. He greets her with [...] "Hello, Liv." ...|$|E

500|$|Willis starred with Tracy Morgan in {{the comedy}} Cop Out, {{directed}} by Kevin Smith and about two police detectives investigating {{the theft of}} a baseball card. The film was released in February 2010. Willis appeared in the music video for the song [...] "Stylo" [...] by Gorillaz. Also in 2010, he appeared in a cameo with former Planet Hollywood co-owners and '80s action stars Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the film The Expendables. Willis {{played the role of}} generic <b>bald</b> <b>man</b> [...] "Mr. Church". This was the first time these three notable action movie actors appeared on screen together. Although the scene featuring the three was short, {{it was one of the}} most highly anticipated scenes in the film. The trio filmed their scene in an empty church on October 24, 2009. Willis next starred in RED, an adaptation of the comic book mini-series of the same name, in which he portrayed Frank Moses. The film was released on October 15, 2010.|$|E
500|$|The {{sequence}} {{begins with}} Bond laying flowers {{at the grave}} of his wife Tracy Bond, before a Universal Exports helicopter picks him up for an emergency. Control of the helicopter is taken over by remote control by a <b>bald</b> <b>man</b> in a grey Nehru jacket with a white cat. This character is unnamed in either the film or the credits, although he looks and sounds like Ernst Stavro Blofeld as played by Donald Pleasence or Telly Savalas. Director John Glen referred to {{the identity of the}} villain obliquely: [...] "We just let people use their imaginations and draw their own conclusions... It's a legal thing". The character is deliberately not named due to copyright restrictions with Kevin McClory, who owned the film rights to Thunderball, which supposedly includes the character Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the organisation SPECTRE, and other material associated with the development of Thunderball. Eon disputed McClory's ownership of the Blofeld character, but decided not to use him again: the scene was [...] "a deliberate statement by Broccoli of his lack of need to use the character." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Harap Alb", one of Ion Creangă's {{most complex}} narratives, carries a moral defined by Călinescu as [...] "the gifted man will earn a {{reputation}} under any guise." [...] The story {{opens with a}} coming of age quest, handed down by a king to his three sons: the most fit among them is supposed to reach the court of the Green Emperor, who is the king's brother, and succeed him to the throne. According to Călinescu, the mission bases itself on travels undertaken by young men in Creangă's native region, while the subsequent episodes in the narrative reinforce the impression of familiarity, from the [...] "peasant speech" [...] adopted by the villain known as the <b>Bald</b> <b>Man,</b> to the [...] "crass vulgarity" [...] evidenced by the antagonist Red Emperor. Forced to pass himself off as a foreign servant (or [...] "Moor"), the prince is three times tested and aided by Holy Sunday, who doubles as the queen of zâne creatures. Călinescu described as [...] "playful realism" [...] the method through which Creangă outlined the mannerisms of several other characters, in particular the allegorical creatures who provide the youngest prince with additional and serendipitous assistance. In one noted instance, the characters Setilă ("Drink-All") and Flămânzilă ("Eat-All") help the hero overcome seemingly impossible tasks set by the Red Emperor, by ingesting unnaturally huge amounts of food and drink.|$|E

500|$|The promotional {{music video}} for [...] "Ice Hockey Hair" [...] was {{directed}} by Daf Palfrey and appears on the DVD version of the band's 'greatest hits' album [...] The video begins with silent footage of five characters, who appear in a small white rectangle in {{the centre of the}} screen against a black background. The text [...] "I am like a film strip ... and like a child ... in a thousand lunar parks ... someone is always ... cranking the handle" [...] appears as the video cuts between shots of each person. [...] "Ice Hockey Hair" [...] begins playing approximately 17 seconds into the video. Each character is again seen in a white rectangle in the centre of the screen followed by a shot of a pair of hands holding a strip of photos of that particular person during which red text is displayed showing the character's name. A woman with short blonde hair and a red top, seen holding {{her head in her hands}} is introduced as [...] "The wife"; a <b>bald</b> <b>man</b> with blood on his head is [...] "The husband"; a woman in a white jacket with a blonde mullet hairstyle is [...] "The mistress"; a man with thick-rimmed glasses, a white jacket, and red polo neck sweater is [...] "The voyeur"; and a man in a red and black tracksuit top with a large scar running from his left eye to right cheek is [...] "The stalker". The five characters are all seen singing along to the track individually, again framed in a white rectangle in the centre of the screen. [...] "The wife" [...] is twice shown ripping a photograph of her and [...] "The husband", while [...] "The mistress" [...] is seen sitting on the lap of [...] "The husband" [...] in two shots. After 1 minute and 6 seconds the Super Furry Animals are shown playing along to the track on a rotating dancefloor surrounded by photo booths and several dancers in dark clothes. During an instrumental break in the song, at 1 minute 38 seconds, two masked men are shown playing table tennis on another rotating dancefloor with two large fluorescent purple circles in the background. The five characters are then seen walking around the band and stepping into the photo booths that surround them. The text [...] "Act 1: The kiss" [...] is shown, after which footage of the Super Furry Animals playing along to the track is intercut with shots of the characters. [...] "The husband" [...] and [...] "The mistress" [...] kiss while a strip of photos is seen being passed through a pair of hands and [...] "The voyeur" [...] is shown using a video camera. The characters move to different photo booths and the title [...] "Act 2: The stalking" [...] is displayed. Shots of [...] "The stalker" [...] and [...] "The wife" [...] are then intercut with shots of the band. The characters again change booths and the title [...] "Act 3: The murder" [...] is shown. After quick jump cuts between shots of the band, the masked men playing table tennis and the five characters, [...] "The voyeur" [...] is shown pointing his video camera at the motionless body of [...] "The mistress" [...] which is laid in a bathtub covered in film stock. More footage of the band follows before [...] "The husband" [...] is shown motionless of the floor, surrounded by a white tape outline. The video ends with more jump cuts between the band, the masked table tennis players and the five named characters.|$|E
2500|$|The triumphant {{return with}} the gems in hand greatly {{increases}} Harap Alb's prestige, and positively impresses the Green Emperor himself. Envious, the <b>Bald</b> <b>Man</b> explains to the imperial court that the feats were entirely attributable to himself, the master, {{and to his}} stern ways. While the monarch agrees with the explanation, his daughter and her sisters are yet more skeptical, and decide to investigate further. Just prior to a feast, they ask the <b>Bald</b> <b>Man</b> to allow Harap Alb the honor of serving at their table, which he agrees to only after making the servant swear {{not to engage in}} conversation with the ladies. During the celebrations, the court is unexpectedly visited by an enchanted bird-like creature, Pasărea măiastră, who announces: [...] "You are eating, drinking and enjoying yourselves, but you fail to think about the Red Emperor's daughter!" [...] There follows a debate [...] concerning the tyrannical Red Emperor and his daughter, during which some of the guests claim that the latter is a malevolent witch, and some still that she is the bird itself, on a mission to propagate fear. After witnessing this, the <b>Bald</b> <b>Man</b> proposes to send Harap Alb on a quest to capture the Red Emperor's daughter and reveal the mystery, the servant being forced to leave before the feast is over. While he is gone, the <b>Bald</b> <b>Man</b> continues to undermine his reputation, but also inadvertently sparks more suspicions about his background and character.|$|E
2500|$|Although voicing {{his lines}} in a colloquial manner deemed [...] "peasant speech" [...] by Călinescu, the <b>Bald</b> <b>Man</b> is {{depicted}} in antithesis with Harap Alb, being, according to Bădărău's definition, [...] "the symbol of evil, a cunning, intimidating, violent, arrogant, dictatorial man." [...] Liliana Vernică also sees in the villain a [...] "double" [...] of the protagonist, one who takes complete control of his victim's mind through persuasion. Historian Adrian Majuru however provides an ethnographic theory regarding the figure, placing it in relation to Romanian history. He thus compares the <b>Bald</b> <b>Man</b> and other hairless antagonists in Romanian folklore with negative images of the raiding Tatars, who, in contrast to their Romanian adversaries, customarily shaved their skulls. According to ethnologist Pavel Ruxăndoiu, the characteristic baldness also has the attribute of an omen, corresponding to a traditional view that God marks dangerous men. He draws a similar conclusion in respect to the fragment in which the <b>Bald</b> <b>Man</b> doubles as the [...] "red man", noting {{that it could be}} read as a proverb (in a line with various attested Romanian sayings, which caution against keeping company with [...] "wild" [...] or [...] "insane" [...] people).|$|E
25|$|Other trends {{leading to}} the decline in toupée use include a rise in {{acceptance}} of baldness by those men afflicted with it. Short haircuts, in fashion since the 1990s, have tended to minimize the appearance of baldness, and many <b>balding</b> <b>men</b> choose to shave their heads entirely.|$|R
