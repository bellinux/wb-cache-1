6000|$|The governess, who {{had put the}} {{foregoing}} questions in order to extract from the Commander of the [...] "Caroline" [...] the information he so pertinaciously withheld, had now exhausted all her own knowledge on the subject, and was compelled to await his further pleasure in the matter, or resort to the less equivocal means of direct interrogation. But the <b>busy</b> <b>state</b> of Wilder's thoughts left her no immediate opportunity to pursue the subject. He soon summoned the officer of the watch to his councils, and they consulted together, apart, for many minutes. The hardy, but far from quick witted, seaman who tilled the second station in the ship saw nothing so remarkable in {{the appearance of a}} strange sail, in the precise spot where the dim and nearly aerial image of the unknown vessel was still visible; nor did he hesitate to pronounce her some honest trader bent, like themselves, on her purpose of lawful commerce. It would seem that his Commander thought otherwise, as will appear by the short dialogue that passed between them.|$|E
6000|$|From Fairbairn's and Manchester, Fleeming {{passed to}} a railway survey in Switzerland, and thence again to Mr. Penn's at Greenwich, {{where he was}} engaged as draughtsman. There, in 1856, we find him in [...] "a terribly <b>busy</b> <b>state,</b> {{finishing}} up engines for innumerable gunboats and steam frigates for the ensuing campaign." [...] From half-past eight in the morning till nine or ten at night, he worked in a crowded office among uncongenial comrades, [...] "saluted by chaff, generally low, personal, and not witty," [...] pelted with oranges and apples, regaled with dirty stories, and seeking to suit himself with his surroundings or (as he writes it) trying to be as little like himself as possible. His lodgings were hard by, [...] "across a dirty green and through some half-built streets of two-storied houses"; he had Carlyle and the poets, engineering and mathematics, to study by himself in such spare time as remained to him; and there were several ladies, young and not so young, with whom he liked to correspond. But {{not all of these}} could compensate for the absence of that mother, who had made herself so large a figure in his life, for sorry surroundings, unsuitable society, and work that leaned to the mechanical. [...] "Sunday," [...] says he, [...] "I generally visit some friends in town, and seem to swim in clearer water, but the dirty green seems all the dirtier when I get back. Luckily I am fond of my profession, or I could not stand this life." [...] It is a question in my mind, if he could have long continued to stand it without loss. [...] "We are not here to be happy, but to be good," [...] quoth the young philosopher; but no man had a keener appetite for happiness than Fleeming Jenkin. There is a time of life besides, when, apart from circumstances, few men are agreeable to their neighbours, and still fewer to themselves; and it was at this stage that Fleeming had arrived, later than common, and even worse provided. The letter from which I have quoted is the last of his correspondence with Frank Scott, and his last confidential letter to one of his own sex. [...] "If you consider it rightly," [...] he wrote long after, [...] "you will find the want of correspondence no such strange want in men's friendships. There is, believe me, something noble in the metal which does not rust, though not burnished by daily use." [...] It is well said; but the last letter to Frank Scott is scarcely of a noble metal. It is plain the writer has outgrown his old self, yet not made acquaintance with the new. This letter from a busy youth of three-and-twenty, breathes of seventeen: the sickening alternations of conceit and shame, the expense of hope in vacuo, the lack of friends, the longing after love; the whole world of egoism under which youth stands groaning, a voluntary Atlas.|$|E

Public knowledge of the California State Police never come to light until its merger with the California Highway Patrol when it received major state news coverage in 1995. At the time of the merger the California State Police was the state’s oldest law enforcement agency (1887-1995 (~108 years)), a record still held today. The California Highway Patrol (CHP) was founded in 1929 and its officers were classified as [...] "State Traffic Officers" [...] until the merger.

30|$|The {{spectrum}} {{resources are}} rare, {{and a large}} part of the spectrum licensed for various applications are not fully used in times or in spaces. These facts motivate the use of cognitive radio (CR) networks coexisting with the licensed primary networks [1, 2]. In CR networks, the secondary users (SUs) are allowed to utilize the frequency channels assigned for the primary users (PUs) when they are currently not being used. This kind of spectrum sharing is referred to as opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) or spectrum overlay. To detect the spectrum opportunities, spectrum sensing may be used. In [3 - 6], the authors consider the OSA system in which an ad hoc CR network operating with a primary network for which N frequency channels are assigned. The channels are assumed to be operating in a TDMA manner with synchronous time slots of equal length and alternating between idle and <b>busy</b> <b>states.</b> The SU may use them when they are idle by channel sensing.|$|R
