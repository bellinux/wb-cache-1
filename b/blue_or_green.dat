5|$|The comb rows of most planktonic ctenophores {{produce a}} rainbow effect, {{which is not}} caused by {{bioluminescence}} but by the scattering of light as the combs move. Most species are also bioluminescent, but the light is usually <b>blue</b> <b>or</b> <b>green</b> and can only be seen in darkness. However some significant groups, including all known platyctenids and the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia, are incapable of bioluminescence.|$|E
5000|$|For example, a Bayesian would {{model the}} color of a car as a {{probability}} distribution over (red, green, blue), assigning one number to each color. Dempster-Shafer would assign numbers to each of (red, <b>green,</b> <b>blue,</b> (red <b>or</b> <b>green),</b> (red <b>or</b> <b>blue),</b> (<b>green</b> <b>or</b> <b>blue),</b> (red <b>or</b> <b>green</b> <b>or</b> <b>blue))</b> which do not have to cohere, for example Bel(red)+Bel(green) != Bel(red <b>or</b> <b>green).</b> This may be computationally more efficient if a witness reports [...] "I saw that the car was either <b>blue</b> <b>or</b> green" [...] in which case the belief can be assigned in a single step rather than breaking down into values for two separate colors. However this can lead to irrational conclusions.|$|R

5|$|In the Roman era, copper was principally mined on Cyprus, {{the origin}} of the name of the metal, from aes сyprium (metal of Cyprus), later {{corrupted}} to сuprum, from which the words copper (English), cuivre (French), Koper (Dutch) and Kupfer (German) are all derived. The commonly encountered compounds are copper(II) salts, which often impart <b>blue</b> <b>or</b> <b>green</b> colors to such minerals as azurite, malachite, and turquoise, and have been used widely and historically as pigments. Copper used in buildings, usually for roofing, oxidizes to form a green verdigris (or patina). Copper is sometimes used in decorative art, both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments. Copper compounds are used as bacteriostatic agents, fungicides, and wood preservatives.|$|E

25|$|Shards {{of broken}} glass or glass rods were being used in mosaics from the Augustan period onwards, but by the {{beginning}} of the 1st century small glass tiles, known as tesserae, were being produced specifically for use in mosaics. These were usually in shades of yellow, <b>blue</b> <b>or</b> <b>green,</b> and were predominantly used in mosaics laid under fountains or as highlights.|$|E
25|$|Government plates: from 1970, these {{plates were}} in the GT-nnnn or GV-nnnn formats, but in the 1990s this was {{replaced}} by the G-nnnnn format. Both of these designs featured red lettering with <b>blue</b> <b>or</b> <b>green</b> numbers. With the introduction of the new standard design in 2008, the format G-00-AA is used. The lettering and numbering on the plates is green instead of the standard blue.|$|E
25|$|Wings of this fly are {{specialized}} {{having a}} sharp bend {{halfway through the}} wing and they are also known to have a well-developed calypter. Blow flies are {{about the size of}} a house fly or a little larger, many are metallic <b>blue</b> <b>or</b> <b>green.</b> Key characteristics of this species include black gena, mostly white calypteres and anterior thoracic spiracles that appear to be orange yellow due to being surrounded by bright orange setae.|$|E

25|$|It is {{distinguished}} {{due to its}} colour which is shiny fluorescent <b>blue</b> <b>or</b> <b>green</b> depending on the angle of observation. The magnificent colours are due to scales in interior of its wings. Also there are spots {{in the bottom of}} its hindwings similar to eyespots. The exterior of wings is brownish black with patterns similar to eyespots. Perhaps the only protection for this species is self-mimicry through the eyespots as regards to its morphology, considering its bright peacock colours and its fast flight.|$|E
25|$|On Advance Direction Signs, as {{introduced}} {{under the}} Guildford Rules, the background colour indicates {{the category of}} route on which it is located. On all directional signs, destination names are placed on the colour appropriate to the category of route used from that junction. A panel of one colour on a different colour of background therefore indicates a change of route status. A smaller area of colour, called a patch, surrounds a bracketed route number (but not its associated destination) to indicate a higher status route that is joined some distance away. A patch may only be coloured <b>blue</b> <b>or</b> <b>green.</b>|$|E
25|$|Methylene blue was {{identified}} by Paul Ehrlich about 1891 {{as a possible}} treatment for malaria. It disappeared as an anti-malarial during the Pacific War in the tropics, since American and Allied soldiers disliked its two prominent, but reversible side effects: turning the urine <b>blue</b> <b>or</b> <b>green,</b> and the sclera (the whites of the eyes) blue. Interest in its use as an anti-malarial has recently been revived, especially due to its low price. Several clinical trials are in progress, {{trying to find a}} suitable drug combination. According to studies on children in Africa, it appears to have efficacy against malaria, but the attempts to combine methylene blue with chloroquine were disappointing.|$|E

25|$|The Near East has, since Roman times, been {{recognized}} as a center of quality glassware and crystal. 9th century finds from Samarra show styles similar to Sassanian forms. The types of objects made were bottles, flasks, vases, and cups utilized for domestic use. Decorations on these domestic items include molded flutes, honeycomb patters, and inscriptions. Other styles seen {{that may not have}} come from the Sassanians were stamped items. These were typically round stamps, such as medallions or disks with animals, birds, or Kufic inscriptions. Colored lead glass, typically <b>blue</b> <b>or</b> <b>green,</b> have been found in Nishapur, along with prismatic perfume bottles. Finally, cut glass may have been the high point of Abbasid glass-working, decorated with floral and animal designs.|$|E
25|$|The {{ceremonial}} huipil of Zinacantán, Chiapas is also {{distinguished by}} its manufacture and symbolism. It {{is made of}} white cotton with a square neckline or with a vertical opening with a button fastener. The chest area is marked off with a red line inside of which are white chicken feathers delicately fastened with white, <b>blue</b> <b>or</b> <b>green</b> thread. The lower border has fringe made of the same materials and colors. It is the only garment in Mexico which uses the pre Hispanic art of featherwork today. This huipil is often used for weddings as {{it is believed that}} it ensures a good marriage. Other white wedding huipils are found in Pinotepa Nacional, Chopan and Cotzocón in Oaxaca. In Pinotepa Nacional, decorative elements include animals, flowers, human figures, fretwork, moons, suns, fish and insects.|$|E
25|$|The 6th impression's blue-green is medium {{light and}} {{distinctly}} blue. The 7th impression's khaki binding, {{on the other}} hand, shows no hint of <b>blue</b> <b>or</b> <b>green.</b> Its color is considerably darker than the 10th through 12th impressions. The rust color of the 7th impression seems slightly darker than the 8th. Also, the 7th is lacquered whereas the 8th is not, which probably accounts for the color difference. The covers on the 10th through 12th impressions {{are very similar to}} each other, lighter than the 6th impression, and contain no distinctly blue cast. The 10th impression might be slightly lighter than the 12th, and the 12th might be slightly lighter than the 11th. However, not enough copies have been seen to be confident that the differences apply across each entire printing. The 14th impression is a heavily saturated grass green, distinctive and unmistakable. The grain of the cloth is finer and has been lacquered to smoothness.|$|E
