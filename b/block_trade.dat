40|$|Using {{high-frequency}} {{data from}} the European Climate Exchange (ECX), we examine the determinants of price impact of € 21 billion worth of <b>block</b> <b>trades</b> during 2008 – 2011 in the European carbon market. We find that wider bid-ask spreads and volatility are characterised by a smaller price impact. Larger levels of price impact {{are more likely to}} occur {{during the middle of the}} trading day, specifically the four-hour period between 11 a. m. and 3 p. m., than during the first or final hours. Purchase <b>block</b> <b>trades</b> induce a relatively smaller price impact on price run-up, while sell <b>block</b> <b>trades</b> exhibit a larger price impact on price run-up. We conclude that <b>block</b> <b>trades</b> on the ECX induce less price impact than in equity or conventional futures markets, and that a significant proportion of the effects contradict findings on <b>block</b> <b>trades</b> in those markets; thus, we provide the first evidence of the curious bent to <b>block</b> <b>trading</b> in the European Union emissions trading scheme...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} open market <b>block</b> <b>trading</b> {{can provide a}} link between private {{benefits}} of control enjoyed by large shareholders and the ?voting premium?, i. e. the price difference between voting and non-voting shares. We first demonstrate in a microstructure model with informed traders and short-selling constraint that the trading activity of blockholders translates into a spread between the prices of voting and non-voting shares. In contrast to the extant theory, this model can explain the voting premium {{in the absence of}} corporate takeovers. In the empirical part of the paper, we show for a comprehensive sample of German dual-class companies that large trades occur more often in voting shares than in non-voting shares, and that the <b>block</b> <b>trading</b> activity in voting shares is strongly correlated with the voting premium. Moreover, the effect of the ownership structure on the voting premium becomes insignificant once we control for the <b>block</b> <b>trading</b> activity in voting shares. [...] ...|$|R
