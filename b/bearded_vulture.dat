5000|$|More recently, in 1945, it is {{said that}} Shimon Peres (called Shimon Persky at the time) and David Ben-Gurion found a nest of <b>bearded</b> <b>vultures</b> in the Negev desert. The bird is called [...] in Hebrew, and Shimon Persky liked it so much he adopted it as his surname.|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{concern about the}} impact of veterinary drugs and livestock pathogens as factors damaging wildlife health, especially of threatened avian scavengers feeding upon medicated livestock carcasses. We conducted a comprehensive study of failed eggs and dead nestlings in <b>bearded</b> <b>vultures</b> (Gypaetus barbatus) to attempt to elucidate the proximate causes of breeding failure behind the recent decline in productivity in the Spanish Pyrenees. We found high concentrations of multiple veterinary drugs, primarily fluoroquinolones, in most failed eggs and nestlings, associated with multiple internal organ damage and livestock pathogens causing disease, especially septicaemia by swine pathogens and infectious bursal disease. The combined impact of drugs and disease as stochastic factors may result in potentially devastating effects exacerbating an already high risk of extinction and should be considered in current conservation programs for <b>bearded</b> <b>vultures</b> and other scavenger species, especially in regards to dangerous veterinary drugs and highly pathogenic poultry viruses...|$|R

The landscape in the park is rugged consisting of mountain peaks, glaciers, rivers, lakes, forests, alpine scrubs and meadows. The forests comprise stands of oak, blue pine, fir, birch, juniper and rhododendron. The park provides habitat for snow leopards, red pandas, musk deer, Himalayan tahrs, and 208 bird species including impeyan pheasant, <b>bearded</b> <b>vulture,</b> snow cock, and the yellow-billed chough.|$|E

50|$|The {{breeding}} season begins in January. The nest is {{a platform of}} sticks placed on an inaccessible ledge on a cliff. Nest in northeastern India have been recorded at between 1215 and 1820 m in elevation, but those in Tibet have been as high as 4245 m. Several pairs may nest on the same cliff face, with between five and seven pairs being a typical colony size. The nests are relatively small for the large size of these birds and, although grow larger with repeated uses, do not generally get as massive as the nest of other large accipitrids. There {{is at least one}} recorded instance of Himalayan vultures using a nest made by <b>bearded</b> <b>vultures</b> (Gypaetus barbatus). On the Tibetan Plateau, Himalayan and <b>bearded</b> <b>vultures</b> were observed nesting in close proximity without conflict, which is notable because in several other cases of adjacent interspecies nesting by Old World vultures (including some involving <b>bearded</b> <b>vultures)</b> have resulted in high aggression and interspecies attacks. A single white egg marked with red splotches is the usual clutch. Egg laying dates in northern India have ranged from December 25 to March 7. The egg is coarse and oval and can measure from 87 to 103.6 mm in height and 65 to 74 mm in width, with an average of 94.8 by 70.1 mm. In captivity the incubation period was about 54-58 days. The young birds stay on with the parents for six to seven months.|$|R
50|$|The park in Goldau still focusses on the endemic and European fauna. In the large, freely {{walkable}} area {{visitors can}} interact with sika deer, fallow deer and mouflons.

Especially noteworthy is the international species programme for <b>bearded</b> <b>vultures.</b>|$|R
50|$|The major {{wildlife}} is lammergeier (Gypaetus barbatus) {{which are}} often seen squatting in large groups beside the road. These very large birds are also known as <b>Bearded</b> <b>Vultures</b> for they have very noticeable, rather comical goatees. Having a passion for bone marrow, they have been seen to carry animal bones to a height and carefully drop them onto rocks to crack {{them so that they}} can feast upon the marrow with greedy delight.|$|R

50|$|Nubian ibexes live {{in rough}} dry mountainous terrain where they eat mainly grasses and leaves and are preyed upon by leopards, eagles and <b>bearded</b> <b>vultures.</b> Nubian ibexes are social and herds tend {{to consist of}} females, young, and males up {{to the age of}} about three years. The males are solitary or form more {{transitory}} bands of up to eight individuals.During the breeding season males join the female-based herds for the six to eight week rut.

50|$|Many rodents such as voles live underground. Marmots live almost {{exclusively}} above {{the tree line}} as high as 2,700 m. They hibernate in large groups to provide warmth, {{and can be found}} in all areas of the Alps, in large colonies they build beneath the alpine pastures. Golden eagles and <b>bearded</b> <b>vultures</b> are the largest birds {{to be found in the}} Alps; they nest high on rocky ledges and can be found at altitudes of 2,400 m.

40|$|A {{sample of}} fossil deer remains (genus Candiacervus) from Mavro Mouri cave, Crete, Greece is studied because a large {{proportion}} shows aberrant, seemingly pathological changes to the morphology {{and the structure of}} the bones. Here we show that the aberrant appearance of the Mavro Mouri bone sample can be understood through a simple taphonomical explanation: post-mortem damage to the bones inflicted by <b>bearded</b> <b>vultures</b> (Gypaetus barbatus). Hence they are not osteoporotically altered due to supposed malnutrition, as proposed before. This conclusion has a bearing on our understanding of island evolution, as it eliminates a supposed direct relation between persistent malnutrition on the one hand, and island dwarfing on the other...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{movement}} of threatened species is important {{if we are to}} optimize management and conservation actions. Here, we describe the age and sex specific spatial and temporal ranging patterns of 19 <b>bearded</b> <b>vultures</b> Gypaetus barbatus tracked with GPS technology. Our findings suggest that spatial asymmetries are a consequence of breeding status and age-classes. Territorial individuals exploited home ranges of about 50 [*]km 2, while non-territorial birds used areas of around 10 000 [*]km 2 (with no seasonal differences). Mean daily movements differed between territorial (23. 8 [*]km) and non-territorial birds (46. 1 [*]km), and differences were also found between sexes in non-territorial birds. Daily maximum distances travelled per day also differed between territorial (8. 2 [*]km) and non-territorial individuals (26. 5 [*]km). Territorial females moved greater distances (12 [*]km) than males (6. 6 [*]km). Taking into account high-use core areas (K 20), Supplementary Feeding Sites (SFS) do not seem {{to play an important role}} in the use of space by <b>bearded</b> <b>vultures.</b> For non-territorial and territorial individuals, 54 % and 46 % of their home ranges (K 90), respectively, were outside protected areas. Our findings will help develop guidelines for establishing priority areas based on spatial use, and also optimize management and conservation actions for this threatened species. A.

40|$|Reintroduced <b>bearded</b> <b>vultures</b> Gypaetus {{barbatus}} in the Alps descend {{mainly from}} birds {{collected in the}} former Soviet Union. A second project has been initiated in southern Spain using the same bloodlines. We used DNA fingerprinting to assess levels of genetic variability, and to determine genetic differences, among birds from the Pyrenees and birds from the Alps reintroduction project. The degree of fingerprint band-sharing was high within both populations, which points to low levels of genetic variation in each population. On the other hand, common fingerprint fragments occurred at markedly different proportions in each population, suggesting some degree of population differentiation. Interbreeding would increase genetic variability in the resulting populations. We thus recommend the incorporation of wild Pyrenean birds to both the Alps and the Spanish breeding projects. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|A taphonomic survey {{concluded}} distinct {{types of}} large animal bone accumulations by different agents. Red deer (Cervus elaphus) and bovine fossils with butchery marks are extremely abundant while carnivore marks are rare. No deer bone is digested while {{nearly half of}} the bones show human interference. Neanderthals account for most of the deer and the bovines and a sizable portion of the chamois and ibex fossils, some of them were secondly scavenged by carnivores.. The survey also allows to favor the hypothesis of extraction by Neanderthals of the fat contained in the spongy tissues of deer bones. In chamois assemblages, 482 fossils were investigated and the non-human predation marks interpreted. <b>Bearded</b> <b>vultures</b> (Gypaetus barbatus), that must have occupied the site during Neanderthal's absence accumulated a high percentage of the chamois bones and to a lower degree those of ibex. Dhole (Cuon alpinus) teeth and bones are the most numerous among carnivores. Milk teeth suggest that Cuon alpinus sheltered its offspring at the site. A 2013 study concluded that dholes contributed to the present composition of animal fossils, to which extent remains debated.|$|R
