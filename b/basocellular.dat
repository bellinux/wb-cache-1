40|$|The Hedgehog/Patched {{signaling}} pathway plays {{a prominent role}} during mammalian development {{but it is also}} involved in oncogenic transformation. We investigated the methylation status of the Patched promoter in a set of <b>basocellular</b> carcinomas of the skin and ovarian tumors as an alternative to mutational causes of the pathway deregulation. Our aim was to define a possible role of genetic and/or epigenetic mechanisms of Hedgehog/Patched signal transduction in the development of these tumors. Bisulfite-converted DNA from tumors and from matched healthy tissue was amplified by a specific PCR and the CpG-rich regions of the Patched promoter were sequenced. Two promoter regions showed statistically significant hypermethylation compared to healthy controls in ovarian tumors; more significantly in the region in the vicinity of Gli 1 -binding sites and less significantly in the region containing the ATG codon. But, in <b>basocellular</b> carcinomas of the skin we observed no difference in methylation, suggesting different mechanisms of neoplasia in these tumors...|$|E

40|$|The B. N. S. shows certain {{similarities}} to other systemic diseases. these diseases are {{often referred to as}} "familial degenerative diseases" ln chapter 8 the common characteristic of theses syndromes are reviewed. The B. N. S. is often characterized by the presence of hamartomas and the tendency toward the growth of tumours in various organs. Thus the syndrome may be ranged with Neurofibromatosis, M. Pringle-Bourneville, M. von Hippel-Lindau, M. Sturge-Weber, Peutz-Jeghesr syndrome, Gardner's syndrome,etc. Eventually Van Der Hoeve (1938), Musger (1964) and Nicholls(1970) classified these lesions under the name of phacomatosis. Although patients have been described who have had additional symptoms of other syndromes (Neurofibromatosis, Turner's syndrome, Klippel-Feil syndrome, Marfan's syndrome) the <b>basocellular</b> naevus syndrome must be considered a distinct clinical entity. Though there is some similarity to other syndromes, transitional stages cannot be referred to between the different syndromes. When the symptomso f the B. N. S. are known, the actual diagnosis is not difficult. The characteristic symptoms are: multiple <b>basocellular</b> naevi/carcinomas, Mantoux's porokeratosis, multiple epithelial cysts of the skin, multiple primordial jaw-cysts, skeletal anomalies (sella turcica, shape and size of the skull, etc.) and ectopic calcifications. Additional occurrence of eye-lesions and neurological disturbances as well as familial incidence, may be useful for making a correct diagnosis. The expressivity of the responsible gene, however, is so variable(tables 7. 1, 7. 2) and age-dependent that it is possible that no cutaneous o jaw lesions are present. In these cases especially, skeletal anomalies contribute to a correct diagnosis. That is because they are not age-dependent. Recognition of the syndrome in an early stage is important for early treatment of <b>basocellular</b> carcinomas and primordial jaw-cysts. In this way the prognosis may be improved and extensive mutilations of tissue are prevented. Frequent and life-long control is necessary in order to recognize and treat new tumour formations as early as possible. ...|$|E

Our observations proved that the cordocytes appear from precursor/stem cells only outside the pericytes in the case of nascent dermal vessels, or from mesenchymal cells of the connective tissue surrounding superficial temporal artery within their niches, and they are responsible for multiple functions, especially protective for vessels and nerves in the reticular dermis. Their spatial and temporal interactions, either with each other or with another phenotype, undifferentiated or differentiated cells, and their implications in skin diseases, with changing phenotypes, position, and number, merit much more interest in further comprehensive studies.

40|$|Skin lesions, {{benign and}} malignant, {{are more common}} in the older than younger people. Due to the aging of the skin and greater {{exposure}} to the impact of ultraviolet rays, their long-term cumulative negative effect, skin lesions are {{more common in the}} head and neck area than on other parts of the skin. This paper analyses the pathohistological diagnosis of material after the surgical excision of tumors of the skin on the head and neck of persons older than 60, at the General Hospital Karlovac through two five-year period. The first period is the period from 2006 to 2010 and the second one from 1996 to 2000. The aim was to determine for each period the type and variety of skin lesions, the prevalence of the disease, the age and gender structure, and finally to compare the two periods. The total number of excisions in the first period was 1200, and in the second 513. In both periods more excisions was done in women than men, if compared it comes to 1. 4 : 1. The ratio of malignant (<b>basocellular</b> carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanomas), and benign tumors (seborrheic keratoses, moles and others) in the first period was 49. 3 to 46. 3 %, and in the second 56. 7 to 42. 1 %. Precancerous lesions (actinic keratoses and Mb Bowen’s disease) accounted for 4. 3 % of lesions in the first and 1. 2 % in the second period. The total number of <b>basocellular</b> carcinoma was 481 / 232, which makes 81. 3 % of all malignant tumors in the first, or 79. 7 % in the second period.

40|$|Abstract. The {{lower eyelid}} {{is the most}} common site of tumors of the orbital region, usually of <b>basocellular</b> skin carcinoma, whose {{incidence}} is increasing with population aging in Western countries. The treatment must achieve the complete removal of the neoplasm in order to prevent recurrences, thus requiring eyelid and periocular reconstruction. Several techniques are described for eyelid defect reconstruction, aiming for direct suture eased by flaps, or considering the use of grafts. We report our experience with 22 patients operated on for <b>basocellular</b> carcinoma of the lower eyelid, for wich defects were repaired by means of a full-thickness reconstruction using a canthotomy and lateral cantholisis; in 13 patients the canthotomy was combined with a lateral-canthal flap. We achieved good results in terms of orbital function and aesthetic outcome, as long as radical removal of the tumor without local recurrences was attainable. The lower eyelid {{is the most common}} site of tumors of the orbital region, both for direct involvement, and for extension of the tumor from the surrounding areas, cheeks and zygomatic bone. The basic rule in tumor surgery of the eyelids is to ensure radical excision, even when such treatment involves the sacrifice of several components of the eyelid and neighboring structures, since inadequate excision could lead to a high rate of recurrence (1). The reconstruction comprises a variety of techniques including direct suture, grafts (skin and compounds), skin flaps and muscular or multitissular flaps (2). The choice of one technique alone, or the simultaneous use of different techniques, depends on the extension, localization and infiltration of the tumor. The objectives of eyelid reconstruction are to restore the eyelid structure and function with an acceptable cosmetic result (3). To achieve these goals, a thorough understanding of eyelid anatomy and a good knowledge of the different reconstructive options are necessary. We present our single-center experience, based on a multidisciplinary cooperation between different specialists working at the Perugia General Hospital...|$|E

40|$|Optical {{techniques}} for treatment and characterization of biological tissues are revolutionizing several branches of medical praxis, {{for example in}} ophthalmology or dermatology. The non-invasive, non-contact and non-ionizing character of optical radiation makes it specially suitable for these applications. Optical radiation can be employed in medical ablation applications, either for tissue resection or surgery. Optical ablation may provide a controlled and clean cut on a biological tissue. This is particularly relevant in tumoral tissue resection, where {{a small amount of}} cancerous cells could make the tumor appear again. A very important aspect of tissue optical ablation is then the estimation of the affected volume. In this work we propose a complete predictive model of tissue ablation that provides an estimation of the resected volume. The model is based on a Monte Carlo approach for the optical propagation of radiation inside the tissue, and a blow-off model for tissue ablation. This model is applied to several types of dermatological tumoral tissues, specifically squamous cells, <b>basocellular</b> and infiltrative carcinomas.

Merkel {{cell carcinoma}} morbidity has been continuously increasing {{for the last few}} years. Increasing reported incidence of MCC is probably connected with increasing occurrence of this kind of malignancy or with development of his-tological and immunohistochemical methods of sample examinations which have allowed for more precise diagno-sis of skin tumor that might have pre-viously not been accurately recognized. Merkel cell carcinoma develops as nod-ules early recognized as <b>basocellular</b> car-cinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, ame-lanotic melanoma or skin lymphoma. Merkel cell carcinoma can be morpho-logically similar to skinmetastasis as well as mild changes such as lipoma, cysts, fibroma or vessel changes. Accurate diagnosis is very important because it determines successful management and risk of progression of disease. We describe 5 patients with MCC who underwent surgical excision and then, after estimation of stage of disease, com-plementary treatment. Our observa-tions prove that every tumor with MCC should be cut out with widemargins and regional lymphadenectomy or sentinel node biopsy is compulsory.

40|$|Background. Posttraumatic and {{postoperative}} defects of columella and {{the tip of}} the nose are difficult to reconstruct. There are several operative methods described in the literature, {{and many of them are}} step-by-step procedures with long duration. The aim of this study was to present one-step procedure for reconstruction of the columella and {{the tip of the}} nose with island-shaped arterial forehead flap. Case report. A 45 -year old man was submitted to surgical excision of <b>basocellular</b> skin cancer. After the excision, a defect of the columella and tip of the nose the remained, 3 × 2. 5 cm in dimensions, with exposed alar cartilages.

A total of 2050 individuals requested a skin check {{as a result of}} the leaflet. Most were at low risk, the majority being female (68 %) and aged under 40 years (51. 6 %), with no risk factors (58. 3 %). One hundred and ninety subjects were referred for surgery for pigmented and non-pigmented suspect lesions. Histological diagnoses, obtained for all lesions, comprised 13 melanomas, 17 dysplastic naevi, 17 <b>basocellular</b> carcinomas, 140 pigmented benign lesions and three lesions of other types.

40|$|The MHC class I chain-related protein A (MICA) is an {{inducible}} molecule almost not {{expressed by}} normal cells but strongly up-regulated in tumor cells. MICA-expressing cells are recognized by natural killer (NK) cells, CD 8 + aßTCR and ?dTCR T lymphocytes through the NKG 2 D receptor. Engagement of NKG 2 D by MICA triggers IFN-? secretion and cytotoxicity against malignant cells. Although most solid tumors express MICA and this molecule is a target during immune surveillance against tumors, {{it has been}} observed that high grade tumors from different histotypes express low amounts of cell surface MICA due to a metalloprotease- induced shedding. Also, melanomas develop after a complex process of neotransformation of normal melanocytes. However, the expression of MICA in premalignant stages (primary human quiescent melanocytic nevi) remains unknown. Here, we assessed expression of MICA by flow cytometry using cell suspensions from 15 primary nevi isolated from 11 patients. When collected material was abundant, cell lysates were prepared and MICA expression was also analyzed by Western blot. We observed that MICA was undetectable in the 15 primary nevi (intradermic, junction, mixed, lentigo and congenital samples) as well as in normal skin, benign lesions (seborrheic keratosis), premalignant lesions (actinic keratosis) and benign <b>basocellular</b> cancer. Conversely, a primary recently diagnosed melanoma showed intense cell surface MICA. We conclude that the onset of MICA expression is a tightly regulated process that occurs after melanocytes trespass the stage of malignant transformation. Thus, analysis of MICA expression in tissue sections of skin samples may constitute a useful marker to differentiate between benign and malignant nevi...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} and confirm the efficacy {{and safety of}} electrochemotherapy (ECT) using bleomicyn in a large series of non-melanoma head and neck cancers. Background: ECT combines chemotherapy and electroporation to increase drug uptake into cancer cells. ECT {{has proven to be}} effective in the treatment of tumor nodules of cutaneous and subcutaneous localization. Up to now, this therapy has been mainly used as a local control of melanoma skin metastasis. Few studies have focused on its role in the treatment of head and neck cutaneous and subcutaneous cancers. Methods: Twenty-five patients underwent ECT for the treatment of non-melanoma head and neck cancers. All tumors were classified by histological type (confirmed by biopsy), size, and TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors (TNM). Treatments were performed using a bolus of bleomicyn and a pulse generator under local or general anesthesia after the ESOPE (European Standard Operating Procedures of Electrochemotherapy) standard operating procedures. Results: An objective response was achieved in 100 % of treated patients (n = 25) at 6 weeks after the initial treatment. The complete response rate according to the WHO criteria was 72 % (n = 18); the partial response rate was 28 % (n = 7). None of the lesions that achieved a complete response relapsed after a median follow-up period of 18 months. Partial responders showed stable disease {{for the duration of the}} follow-up. Conclusions: In accordance with the clinical results shown, we encourage further investigation to establish ECT's use as first line treatment especially in <b>basocellular</b> carcinomas of the head and neck area and for squamocellular carcinomas of the lip with no detectable cervical lymphoadenopathy...|$|E
40|$|Cell {{substrate}} adhesion is {{a prerequisite}} for invasion and the subsequent formation of metastases, Therefore, we designed monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against epitopes on the extracellular cell membrane domain of SK-BR 3 cells. One of the antibodies, called MAb 14 C 5, binds to an extracellular epitope of a plasma membrane antigen of SK-BR- 3 and MCF- 7 human breast cancer cells. This MAb 14 C 5 is able to inhibit cell substrate adhesion, not only on culture-treated plastic but also on host tissue, and therefore prevents invasion and metastases, We evaluated the tissue distribution of the 14 C 5 antigen by immunohistochemistry. The antigen is specifically overexpressed in 64 % of invasive ductal adenocarcinomas of the breast (n= 33), in all investigated cases of invasive squamous cell carcinoma (n= 7) and in 40 % of <b>basocellular</b> carcinomas of the skin (n= 5). The 14 C 5 molecule is located on the cell membrane of the carcinoma cells, However, when the tumor is characterized by a highly invasive phenotype, 65 % of the cases also show an extensive stromal expression on the fibroblasts between the tumor cells (n= 71). This stromal expression is caused by the presence of the 14 C 5 antigen on the membrane of the adjacent fibroblasts, In normal tissues {{as well as in the}} stroma surrounding in situ carcinomas of the breast (n= 15), no expression of the 14 C 5 antigen occurred, A 90 -kDa protein was purified from lysates of human breast cancer cells using a 14 C 5 MAb Sepharose column and is considered as the antigen recognized by the MAb 14 C 5...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{retrospective}} analysis {{of management and}} survival of patients treated for temporal bone carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients underwent treatment for carcinoma of the temporal bone. Twenty-five squamous cell carcinomas, 1 melanoma, 2 <b>basocellular</b> carcinomas and 2 adenoid cystic carcinomas were treated. Thirteen patients were treated before for the same disease. RESULTS: Staging revealed 12 T 1 and T 2, 6 T 3 and 12 T 4 tumours. The mean follow up was 5 years (2 - 276 months). The Kaplan Meier survival curves showed survival rates at 2 years of 82 %, 67 % and 32 %, and at 5 years of 82 %, 67 % and 17 %, respectively for the stages T 1 or T 2, T 3 and T 4. At the end of follow up at 9 years the survival rates were 66 %, 66 % and 17 % for the stages T 1 or T 2, T 3 and T 4 respectively. Overall stages a complete remission was found in 65 % and 23 %, and deceased was 35 % and 77 %, respectively for the primary treatment group and the salvage surgery group. CONCLUSION: Long-term prognosis of the carcinoma of {{the external auditory canal}} mainly depends on the stage and primary treatment. Surgery (lateral temporal bone or subtotal temporal bone resection, both in combination with a neck dissection and a parotidectomy) and adjuvant radiotherapy is the treatment of choice for part of stage T 1 and all T 2 and T 3 tumours. The improved survival (65 %) of patients treated de novo compared with those treated with salvage surgery (23 %) suggests that early referral and aggressive primary surgical treatment with postoperative radiotherapy offer the greatest chance of cur...|$|E
40|$|Background: The role of radiolabeled choline (Cho) in {{patients}} with biochemical recurrence after radical treatment for prostate cancer (PCA) is well established. Its widespread clinical use has prompted the depiction of incidentalomas, unusual sites of metastatic lesions, as well as false positive and negative cases. We reported a series of patients affected by biochemical recurrence of PCA imaged by [18 F]Cho positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) which resulted suspected for a second malignancy. Case presentation: [18 F]Cho PET/CT was performed {{in patients}} with biochemical PCA recurrence. From an internal clinical database we identified patients in which PET/CT resulted suspected for a second malignancy. A second malignancy was suspected in presence of "unusual" site of [18 F]Cho uptake not consistent with clinical-instrumental history. Histology was used as reference standard for final diagnosis. Seven PCA patients (76 years, 71 - 84 years) with the suspicion of a second tumor based on [18 F]Cho PET/CT findings were identified. Mean value of PSA {{at the time of}} [18 F]Cho PET/CT was 2, 37 ng/mL. The median time between PCA diagnosis and PET/CT was 6 years (range 0 - 14 years). In two cases history of a second malignancy (lung cancer and cutaneous <b>basocellular</b> carcinoma) was known (diagnosed 12 and 6 years after PCA, respectively). PET/CT identified 13 sites of [18 F]Cho uptake (lung = 5, lymph node = 7, bone = 1). Final diagnosis was consistent with lung cancer in 5 / 7 cases (first diagnosis = 4 / 5, recurrence = 1 / 5), colorectal cancer and nodal metastases from melanoma in 1 case each. Conclusions: Although the clinical usefulness of Cho PET/CT for detecting cancer lesions other than prostate origin is known, for those patients who undergo this examination according to indication, the diagnosis of a second tumor has a significant impact on their therapeutic management...|$|E
40|$|Laser {{surgery is}} a {{commonly}} used technique for tissue ablation or the resection of malignant tumors. It presents advantages over conventional non-optical ablation techniques, like a scalpel or electrosurgery, {{such as the}} increased precision of the resected volume, minimization of scars and shorter recovery periods. Laser surgery is employed in medical branches such as ophthalmology or dermatology. The application of laser surgery requires the optimal adjustment of laser beam parameters, {{taking into account the}} particular patient and lesion. In this work we present a predictive tool for tissue resection in biological tissue after laser surgery, which allows an a priori knowledge of the tissue ablation volume, area and depth. The model employs a Monte Carlo 3 D approach for optical propagation and a rate equation for plasma-induced ablation. The tool takes into account characteristics of the specific lesion to be ablated, mainly the geometric, optical and ablation properties. It also considers the parameters of the laser beam, such as the radius, spatial profile, pulse width, total delivered energy or wavelength. The predictive tool is applied to dermatology tumor resection, particularly to different types of non-melanoma skin cancer tumors: <b>basocellular</b> carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and infiltrative carcinoma. The ablation volume, area and depth are calculated for healthy skin and for each type of tumor {{as a function of the}} laser beam parameters. The tool could be used for laser surgery planning before the clinical application. The laser parameters could be adjusted for optimal resection volume, by personalizing the process to the particular patient and lesion. This work has been partially supported by the project MAT 2012 - 38664 -C 02 - 01 of the Spanish Ministery of Economy and Competitiveness and by The San Cándido Foundatio...|$|E
40|$|Renal {{transplantation}} {{is associated}} with increased incidence of cancer. We reviewed a large series of renal transplant recipients to determine the incidence and outcome of patients with malignant changes located at the head and neck. A total of 1232 renal transplant recipients have been followed at Department of Dialysis University Hospital Centre Zagreb from 1972 to 2009. Demographic data, localization and disease outcome were evaluated in patients who developed cancer. Twenty one patients (1, 7 %) developed 27 head and neck malignancies. The average time from transplantation to development of cancer was 56, 8 months. The mean length of follow-up was 9, 4 ± 4, 8 years. Eighteen malignancies were cutaneous in origin and 9 were noncutaneous. Of cutaneous malignancies, 88. 9 % were basal cell carcinoma; one patient had Merkell-cell carcinoma and one patient developed squamous cell carcinoma. Six cases of <b>basocellular</b> skin cancer were recorded in one fair-skin patient. Noncutaneous malignancies involved the oral cavity (2 cases of Kaposi’s sarcoma and one pharyngeal cancer) and the thyroid gland in 3 patients each. Two patients had post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder occurring at the head and neck. One patient had brain tumor. Radical surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy were necessary in 33, 3 % of patients. Immunosuppression was reduced in all patients, and 12 patients were switched from the calcineurin-based immunosuppression to sirolimus. They all have stable graft function. None of the patients died from cancer. Immunosuppression was ceased in one patient with Kaposi’s sarcoma who returned to dialysis and died 10 years later from heart failure. An increased incidence of cancer occurring {{in the head and}} neck was recorded. Careful skin examination and oral examination is mandatory for discovering cancer before dissemination. Sirolimus is safe alternative to calcineurin-based immunosuppression in patients who developed head and neck malignancies...|$|E
40|$|Renal {{transplant}} {{recipients are}} {{at higher risk}} of certain tumors such as lymphomas and skin cancers and than the general and dialysis populations. We retrospectively studied the prevalence of tumors in adult renal transplant recipients in four Tunisian centers of transplantation in Tunis, Monsatir and Sfax from January 1986 to January 2005. The study included 36 patients; 19 men and 17 women {{with a mean age}} of 34. 6 years (range from 18 - 54 years). The mean time since dialysis to transplantation was 43 months (6 - 131 months). Maintenance therapy was based on calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) in 86 &#x 0025; of cases, on antimetabolites and corticosteroids in 100 &#x 0025; of cases. Anti-thymoglobulin was administered in a mean course of 12. 4 days in 78 &#x 0025; of the patients. Acute rejection occurred in 25 cases and was treated with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies on 40 &#x 0025; of cases. Incidence of cancer among our population was 7 &#x 0025; and occurred after a mean period of 54 months of transplantation (range from 4 - 160 months). Eighty three percent of the tumors were solid, and the rest were in the skin. Kaposi sarcoma formed 41. 6 &#x 0025; and non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin lymphoma 27. 7 &#x 0025; of the solid tumors, while spinocellular carcinoma formed 83 &#x 0025; and <b>basocellular</b> carcinoma 17 &#x 0025; of the skin tumors. Switching CNI to sirolimus in 8. 3 &#x 0025; cases was associated with a favorable outcome. Mortality was the outcome in 33. 3 &#x 0025; of the patients with cancer, while partial or complete regression of cancers was observed in 55. 5 &#x 0025; cases after decreasing the doses of the immunosuppressive medications. We conclude that post renal transplant cancer is mainly characterized by the predominance of Kaposi sarcoma favored by solar exposure and rigorously induced and maintained immunosuppression. Careful follow-up may results in early inter-vention and decrease mortality...|$|E
