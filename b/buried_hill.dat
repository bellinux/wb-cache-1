40|$|Groundwater {{samples from}} <b>buried</b> <b>hill</b> of Jizhong Depression were {{evaluated}} using two statistical analyses: hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and {{principal component analysis}} (PCA). The samples were classified into four clusters, C 1 –C 4, in HCA and the hydrochemical types of C 1 –C 4 are HCO 3 -Na, Cl·HCO 3 -Na, Cl-Na, and Cl-Na·Ca. From C 1 to C 2, C 3, and C 4, the water-rock interaction becomes increasingly intensive, and rNa/rCl gets lower while total dissolved solids and r(Cl-Na) /rMg get higher. Three components of PCA explain 86. 87 % of the variance. Component 1 (PC 1), characterized by highly positive loadings in Na+ and Cl−, is related to evaporation concentration. Component 2 (PC 2) is defined by highly positive loading in HCO 3 - and is related to influence of atmospheric water. With high positive loadings in Ca 2 + and high negative loadings in Na+ and SO 42 -, component 3 (PC 3) suggests plagioclase albitization. The combination of HCA and PCA within the hydrogeological contexts allowed the division of study area into five dynamic areas. From recharge area to discharge area, the influence of atmospheric water gets weaker and water-rock interactions such as evaporation concentration and plagioclase albitization become intensive. Therefore groundwater in <b>buried</b> <b>hill</b> showed paths of hydrochemical evolution, from C 1, to C 2, C 3, and C 4. <b>Buried</b> <b>hill</b> reservoir in Jizhong Depression is mainly distributed in hydrodynamic blocking and discharge area; therefore the two regions can be the favorable areas for petroleum migration...|$|E

The {{results show that}} the period of the karst development is mainly in Tertiary, with spatial inhomogeneity. The inhomogeneity is mainly controlled by the geological construction in the horizontal direction. There are 3 ∼ 4 level karst developing zones in the profile section, which are mainly controlled by the intermittent subsidence of the earth’s crust started from Tertiary. The forming time of the lower karst zones is earlier than that of the upper ones. The horizontal karst zones are cut off by the latter faults. At present, the chief potential areas of residual oil of Renqiu oilfield are in the weak karst developing zones...|$|E
30|$|Great {{quantities}} of light {{oil and gas}} are produced from deep <b>buried</b> <b>hill</b> reservoirs at depths of 5, 641 m to 6, 027 m and 190 °C to 201 °C in the Niudong- 1 Well, representing the deepest and hottest commercial hydrocarbons discovered in the Bohai Bay Basin in eastern China. This discovery suggests favorable exploration prospects for the deep parts of the basin. However, the discovery raises questions regarding the genesis and accumulation of hydrocarbons in deep reservoirs. Based on the geochemical features of the hydrocarbons and characteristics of the source rocks as well as thermal simulation experiments of hydrocarbon generation, we conclude that {{the oil and gas}} were generated from the highly mature Sha- 4 Member (Es 4) source rocks instead of thermal cracking of crude oils in earlier accumulations. The source kitchen with abnormal pressures and karsted carbonate reservoirs control the formation of high-maturity hydrocarbon accumulations in the buried hills (i.e., Niudong- 1) in conjunction with several structural-lithologic traps in the Es 4 reservoirs since the deposition of the upper Minghuazhen Formation. This means the oil and gas exploration potential in the deep parts of the Baxian Depression is probably high.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Tarim Basin is a {{representative}} {{example of the}} basins developed in the northwest China that are characterized by multiple stages of heating and cooling. In order to better understand its complex thermal history, apatite fission track (AFT) thermochronology was applied to borehole samples from the Tazhong Uplift Zone (TUZ). Twelve sedimentary samples of Silurian to Triassic depositional ages were analyzed from depths coinciding with the apatite partial annealing zone (∼ 60 – 120  °C). The AFT ages, ranging from 132  ±  7  Ma (from a Triassic sample) to 25  ±  2  Ma (from a Carboniferous sample), are clearly younger than their depositional ages and demonstrate a total resetting of the AFT thermometer after deposition. The AFT ages vary among different tectonic belts and decrease from the No. Ten Faulted Zone (133 – 105  Ma) in the northwest, the Central Horst Zone in the middle (108 – 37  Ma), to the East <b>Buried</b> <b>Hill</b> Zone in the south (51 – 25  Ma). Given the low magnitude of post-Triassic burial heating evidenced by low vitrinite reflectance values (Ro <  0. 7 %), the total resetting of the AFT system is speculated to result from the hot fluid flow along the faults. Thermal effects along the faults are well documented by younger AFT ages and unimodal single grain age distributions {{in the vicinity of}} the faults. Permian–early Triassic basaltic volcanism may be responsible for the early Triassic total annealing of those samples lacking connectivity with the fault. The above arguments are supported by thermal modeling results...|$|E

30|$|Stress {{sensitivity}} and water blocking in fractured carbonate reservoir formations with low permeability were determined {{as the main}} potential damage mechanisms during drilling and completion operations in the ancient <b>buried</b> <b>hill</b> Ordovician reservoirs in the Tarim Basin. Geological structure, lithology, porosity, permeability and mineral components all affect the potential for formation damage. The experimental {{results showed that the}} permeability loss was 83.8 %– 98.6 % caused by stress sensitivity, and was 27.9 %– 48.1 % caused by water blocking. Based on the experimental results, several main conclusions concerning stress sensitivity can be drawn as follows: the lower the core permeability and the smaller the core fracture width, the higher the stress sensitivity. Also, stress sensitivity results in lag effect for both permeability recovery and fracture closure. Aimed at the mechanisms of formation damage, a modified low-damage mixed metal hydroxide (MMH) drilling fluid system was developed, which was mainly composed of low-fluorescence shale control agent, filtration control agent, low-fluorescence lubricant and surfactant. The results of experimental evaluation and field test showed that the newly-developed drilling fluid and engineering techniques provided could dramatically increase the return permeability (over 85 %) of core samples. This drilling fluid had such advantages as good rheological and lubricating properties, high temperature stability, and low filtration rate (API filtration less than 5 ml after aging at 120 °C for 4 hours). Therefore, fractured carbonate formations with low permeability could be protected effectively when drilling with the newly-developed drilling fluid. Meanwhile, field test showed that both penetration rate and bore stability were improved and the soaking time of the drilling fluid with formation was sharply shortened, indicating that the modified MMH drilling fluid could meet the requirements of drilling engineering and geology.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDeep marine {{carbonate}} rocks {{have become}} one of the key targets of onshore oil and gas exploration and development for reserves replacement in China. Further geological researches of such rocks may practically facilitate the sustainable, steady and smooth development of the petroleum industry in the country. Therefore, through a deep investigation into the fundamental geological conditions of deep marine carbonate reservoirs, we found higher-than-expected resource potential therein, which may uncover large oil or gas fields. The findings were reflected in four aspects. Firstly, {{there are two kinds of}} hydrocarbon kitchens which were respectively formed by conventional source rocks and liquid hydrocarbons cracking that were detained in source rocks, and both of them can provide large-scale hydrocarbons. Secondly, as controlled by the bedding and interstratal karstification, as well as the burial and hydrothermal dolomitization, effective carbonate reservoirs may be extensively developed in the deep and ultra-deep strata. Thirdly, under the coupling action of progressive burial and annealing heating, some marine source rocks could form hydrocarbon accumulations spanning important tectonic phases, and large quantity of liquid hydrocarbons could be kept in late stage, contributing to rich oil and gas in such deep marine strata. Fourthly, large-scale uplifts were formed by the stacking of multi-episodic tectonism and oil and gas could be accumulated in three modes (i. e., stratoid large-area reservoir-forming mode of karst reservoirs in the slope area of uplift, back-flow type large-area reservoir-forming mode of <b>buried</b> <b>hill</b> weathered crust karst reservoirs, and wide-range reservoir-forming mode of reef-shoal reservoirs); groups of stratigraphic and lithologic traps were widely developed in the areas of periclinal structures of paleohighs and continental margins. In conclusion, deep marine carbonate strata in China onshore contain the conditions for widely and intensively preserving hydrocarbons, so large oil or gas fields are expected...|$|E
40|$|Carbonate {{reservoir}} characterization based on rock physics and seismic inversion helps in better understanding {{the influence of}} deposition and diagenesis on rock property. In this dissertation, I first study a modern carbonate platform to {{understand the relationship between}} dolomitization and sea level change and oceanography; I then analyze the geological control of diagenesis carbonate pore types on elastic properties, such as velocity and impedance, and finally I study the geophysical signatures and inversion of highly fractured zones in deeply buried carbonates using logs and seismic data. On the Southern Marion platform, dolostone with large pores generally has high permeability, high sonic velocity, and high acoustic impedance at given porosity compared to limestone. Acoustic impedance inversion picks out three dolomitization events, matching well with three high stands of sea level events, to illustrate that the high stand of sea level induces the formation of dolomitization zones with large pores. This study demonstrates the positive feedback loop of dolomitization and ocean current circulation, as well as the relationship between dolomitization and sea level change. The pore types in carbonates complicate the porosity-velocity and porosity-permeability relationships, lowering the prediction accuracy of porosity from porosity-impedance relationships. The application of the Sun rock physics model in an ultra-deep carbonate reservoir showed that the product of porosity and pore structure parameter has a much better linear relationship with velocity/impedance than porosity with velocity/impedance. This finding reveals that porosity?together with pore structure parameter, dominates the elastic rock properties in carbonates, not porosity alone. The major storage spaces are fractures and fracture related dissolution pores (cavities, molds, and vugs) in Hexiwu carbonate <b>buried</b> <b>hill,</b> in the Bohai Bay basin, China. Log analysis shows fractured zones, with open- and large-angle fractures, have porosity less than 5 %, bulk modulus less than 55 GPa, and acoustic impedance less than 15, 500 (g/cc) ?(m/s). These typical fractured zones have a high pore structure parameter?higher than 6 ?using the Sun model. Seismic inversion for porosity and pore structure parameter shows that the fractured and high-porosity zones are subject to the structural setting in this area, which is controlled by the regional tectonics in the Bohai Bay basin. The proposed methodology is applicable to fractured reservoirs in similar geological settings...|$|E

30|$|After half a century’s effort, gratifying {{achievements}} {{have been}} made in deep petroleum exploration throughout the world, despite being faced with challenges and problems today. The Former Soviet Union discovered four 6, 000  m or deeper industrial oil–gas reservoirs out of its 24 petroliferous basins (Tuo 2002). The oil discovered in deep basins in Mexico, the USA, and Italy contributes more than 31  % of their present recoverable oil reserves (Kutcherov et al. 2008) and the natural gas discovered there makes up approximately 47  % of their total proved natural gas reserves (Burruss 1993). China, too, has appreciable achievements in deep petroleum exploration. Compared with 2000, the deep reserves discovered in West China in 2013 increased an average of 3.5 times. The ratio of deep petroleum reserves increased from 40  % in 2002 to 80  % in 2013. Of the 156 well intervals in the Tarim Basin that have been tested so far, 58 have gone deeper than 5, 000  m. The deep drillhole success rate in the Jizhong Depression is as high as 21.4  %. A 5, 190 -m-deep “Qianmiqiao <b>buried</b> <b>hill</b> hydrocarbon reservoir” was discovered in the Huanghua Depression (Tuo 2002). Despite these achievements, however, a lot of problems have also emerged in deep petroleum exploration. These include (a) the difficulty in understanding the conditions of deep oil–gas reservoirs and evolution due to the multiple tectonic events having taken place in deep basins (Zhang et al. 2000; He et al. 2005), (b) the difficulty in evaluating the resource potential and relative contribution due to the complex sources and evolution processes of deep petroleum (Barker 1990; Mango 1991; Dominé et al. 1998; Zhao et al. 2001; Jin et al. 2002; Zhao et al. 2005; Darouich et al. 2006; Huang et al. 2012; Pang et al. 2014 a), (c) the difficulty in predicting and evaluating favorable targets due to the complex genesis and distribution of deep, relatively high-porosity and high-permeability reservoirs (Surdam et al. 1984; Ezat 1997; Dolbier 2001; Rossi et al. 2001; Moretti et al. 2002; Lin et al. 2012), and (d) the difficulty in predicting and evaluating the petroleum possibility in deposition targets due to the complex deposition mechanism and development pattern of deep petroleum (Luo et al. 2003, 2007; Ma and Chu 2008; Ma et al. 2008; Pang et al. 2008).
