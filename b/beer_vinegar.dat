50|$|Glischrochilus beetles {{from the}} {{subgenus}} Librodor, consisting {{the majority of}} species in the genus, feed on exuding sap from injured trees and decaying vegetable or fungal matter. They are also attracted to ripening fruits, as well as <b>beer,</b> <b>vinegar,</b> wine, fruit juice and fermenting beverages. They frequently drown as they feed, rendering these liquids unsuitable for consumption. They congregate in large numbers when such beverages are present, often ruining picnics and outdoor gatherings like barbecues, earning them their common names of 'picnic beetles', 'picnic bugs', or 'beer bugs'. Researchers who wish to attract the bugs use bait that contains beer, molasses, vinegar, pineapple and other ingredients.|$|E

5000|$|Solera is {{a process}} for aging liquids such as wine, <b>beer,</b> <b>vinegar,</b> and brandy, by {{fractional}} blending {{in such a way}} that the finished product is a mixture of ages, with the average age gradually increasing as the process continues over many years. The purpose of this labor-intensive process is the maintenance of a reliable style and quality of the beverage over time. Solera means literally [...] "on the ground" [...] in Spanish, and it refers to the lower level of the set of barrels or other containers used in the process; the liquid (traditionally transferred from barrel to barrel, top to bottom, the oldest mixtures being in the barrel right [...] "on the ground"), although the containers in today's process are not necessarily stacked physically in the way that this implies, but merely carefully labeled. Products which are often solera aged include Sherry, Madeira, Lillet, Port wine, Marsala, Mavrodafni, Muscat, and Muscadelle wines; Balsamic, Commandaria, some Vins doux naturels, and Sherry vinegars; Brandy de Jerez; beer; rums; and whiskies. Since the origin of this process is undoubtedly out of the Iberian peninsula, most of the traditional terminology was in Spanish, Portuguese, or Catalan.|$|E

40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} the bacterial species {{associated with an}} outbreak of spoilage in commercially bottled red wine where the bottles had been stored in an upright vertical compared with horizontal position. Methods and Results: Bottled wines comprising Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Shiraz, Merlot and blended red varieties were examined for visible spoilage. Analysis of visibly affected and non-affected wines revealed a spectrum of aroma and flavour defects, ranging from loss of fruity aroma, staleness, oxidized character to overt volatile acidity. Only acetic acid bacteria, and not yeast or lactic acid bacteria, could be isolated from both spoiled and unspoiled wines and were found to grow only on Wallerstein Nutrient (WL) medium supplemented with 10 % red wine or 1 – 2 % ethanol. Analysis of the 16 S rRNA region and RAPD-PCR analysis showed the isolates to be a closely related group of Acetobacter pasteurianus, but this group was differentiated from the group comprising <b>beer,</b> <b>vinegar</b> and cider strains. Conclusions: A. pasteurianus was the species considered responsible for the spoilage but the isolates obtained had atypical properties for this species. In particular, they failed to grow on WL nutrient medium without ethanol or wine supplementation. Storage of the bottles of wine containing A. pasteurianus in an upright vertical position specifically induced growth and spoilage in a proportion of the bottles under conditions that were inhibitory for horizontally stored bottles.

50|$|You {{could say}} {{my house in}} Jasper is in Avoca (2015). I live {{on a piece of}} land that was a part of Pete Miller's farm, which was once part of the Miller Plantation in the 1850s. Avoca was a turpentine/farming {{community}} for many years. Farming and plantation operations created the small community and Turpentine maintained it later. In 1916 it was a prosperous community located in our Hamilton County Florida around the junction of CR 150 and US HWY 129. Hebron Cemetery supported the community and Church was held at Bakers Mill. Miller’s Crossing was a few miles from Avoca. L.E. Miller had a substantial plantation farm there and housed the commissary or general store where Boots (Brogans), Jeans, mostly overalls, Georgia knits (socks) and hickory striped shirts were sold and nearly uniform wear in the area. Calico Dresses and high topped shoes were there for the women folk as well as “Homespun” cloth to make underwear and sheets. Foodstuffs of sugar, rice, grits, and soda crackers (the famous cracker barrel around a pot bellied stove comes to mind), chewing tobacco, “Brown Mule and Apple” in a large case stood {{at the front of the}} store. There were NO packaged cigarettes sold (called “ready rolled” by locals) in that day but corn cob pipes and pipe tobacco was there. Huge 60 gallon drums of home brew <b>beer,</b> kerosene, <b>vinegar,</b> nails, cane syrup… coupled with oil lamps, and lanterns all hung or stood throughout the store. Pots, pans, and washtubs could be purchased as well…candy in big wooden kegs included licorice, peppermint sticks, sugar teats, and those huge 6” ginger cookies (notched around the edge). Hunting supplies and ammunition was there too.The community had several schools in a four to five mile area….and in 1915 consolidating schools became a common and necessary reality. Leigh school (named in honor of Philemon Leigh), unpainted, two windows in front, a well under a huge oak tree, covered with streamers of Spanish moss, with a sandbag swing tied to very high limb by a steel cable gave the children a playful “recess”. The girls enjoyed a “two hole” outhouse in the back rear of the school while the boys used the “outhouse” oak thicket across the road; it was called “Down South”. Mrs. Chloe McCall Horton rang the morning bell to the excitement of the students…in that day most all children loved school. Ms. Helen McCall was the teacher, later Ms. Audra Adams. The school was later named “Progress” (included Leigh School, Dry Branch School, and McBranch School)….enlarged to two big rooms and eight windows to each side, a library in the front and outside stood two new 4-hole outhouses! Children came from growing families such as the Cowarts, George Smiths, and the Duncans. Richard Duncan married Lily Hill, daughter of Ed Hill (father of Clarence Hill and grandfather of Billy Hill. The Morgans, The Johnnie Stephens, The Joe Hunters, The Joneses, and the Deloaches (Tap Deloach was an early pioneer), The Will Jackson’s, and the Webbs. Avoca was in the ninth district in those days and was a grand place to live.By Charles Anthony Tuten Sr.|$|R
