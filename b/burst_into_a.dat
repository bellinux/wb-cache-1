25|$|A {{subset of}} {{nuisance}} {{is known as}} the rule in Rylands v Fletcher where a dam <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> coal mine shaft. So a dangerous escape of some hazard, including water, fire, or animals means strict liability in nuisance. This is subject only to a remoteness cap, familiar from negligence when the event is unusual and unpredictable. This was the case where chemicals from a factory seeped through a floor into the water table, contaminating East Anglia's reservoirs.|$|E
25|$|On July 8, 2014, {{at around}} 13:30, National Security Agency {{operatives}} {{carried out a}} raid at the City King Hotel in Monrovia without a warrant. Five NSA operatives <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> hotel room where the Korean businessmen and Aly had been holding a discussion for a few minutes. Cash {{in the amount of}} US$247,500 and other possessions including a gas dish, melting dish, two packs of gold testing chemicals, an electronic gold scale, and two pocket wallets containing money and credit cards were seized by the NSA. Earlier {{on the day of the}} raid, at 11:00 am, the Korean businessmen had withdrawn the same amount of money seized from the Sinkor, Old Road branch of the International Bank of Liberia and then gone directly to the City King Hotel, expecting to complete the transaction with Aly.|$|E
500|$|Now {{in the key}} of G (two semitones {{down from}} the Get Back performance), [...] "Isn't It a Pity" [...] begins [...] "dirge"-like with a two-note pedal point {{provided}} by layers of keyboards and acoustic guitars. Only at the one-minute mark, {{at the start of}} verse two, does the rhythm section come in, after which the instruments begin to [...] "break out of their metronomic straitjacket to attain an almost ecstatic release", as Beatles Forever author Nicholas Schaffner put it in 1977. The [...] "balmy" [...] slide guitar passage, supported by Barham's string section, follows this second verse, and from that point on – around 2:38 – the same, circular chord structure continues for the remaining four-and-a-half minutes of the song. The long fade-out sees what Schaffner termed the [...] "pseudo-symphonic tension" [...] <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> frenzy of brass and timpani, further bottleneck soloing, and the [...] "What a pity" [...] mantra joined by [...] "Hey Jude"-style [...] "Na-na-na-na" [...] chorus.|$|E

500|$|Occasionally, resurrectionists paid {{women to}} pose as grieving relatives, {{so that they}} might claim a body from a workhouse. [...] Some parishes did little to stop this practice, as it reduced their funeral expenditure. [...] Bodies were also taken from dead houses; Astley Cooper's servant was once forced to return three bodies, worth £34 2s, to a dead house in Newington parish. [...] Bribes were also paid, usually to {{servants}} of recently deceased employers then lying in state, although this method carried its own risks as corpses were often placed on public display before they were buried. [...] Some were taken from private homes; in 1831 The Times reported that [...] "a party of resurrectionists" [...] <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> house in Bow Lane and took the body of an elderly woman, who was being [...] "'waked' by her friends and neighbours". [...] The thieves apparently [...] "acted with the most revolting indecency, dragging the corpse in its death clothes after them through the mud in the street". [...] Bodies were even removed—with no legal authority—from prisons and naval and military hospitals.|$|E
2500|$|The tit-for-tat rampage in {{and around}} Coagh {{continued}} on 29 November 1989, when UVF gunmen <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> pub owned by IRA member Liam Ryan; Ryan and a customer were shot dead. On 8 March 1990, UDR soldier and construction worker Thomas Jamison was killed when the IRA, using guns and a grenade, ambushed the truck he was driving near Donaghmore. Jamison was returning from delivering concrete to a UDR base. He was an employee of Henry Brothers, a construction company that had rebuilt and refurnished a number of security bases across Northern Ireland since 1985. Harold Henry, {{one of the two}} brothers who owned the company, had been killed by the IRA in [...] 1987 in The Loup, County Londonderry.|$|E

[...] In one, she reminisced about living in a San Francisco apartment and competing with a female neighbor in flirting with men on the street. She finished the Calgary concert with long versions of [...] "Get It While You Can" [...] and [...] "Ball and Chain".|$|E

2500|$|The Hastings {{took off}} from Abingdon about 1600 hrs. One {{eyewitness}} reported it flying in company with two RAF Armstrong Whitworth AW.660 Argosy heavy transport aircraft. Eyewitnesses {{in the village of}} Berinsfield reported seeing it fly over, then lose height or dive. They reported the aircraft [...] "weaving from side to side", [...] "its wings wiggled" [...] or [...] "its tail wobbled" [...] before the Hastings climbed steeply out of control. It then fell with all four engines still running and crashed into a field at Little Baldon called Hundred Acres, about [...] east of Abingdon and [...] southeast of Oxford. The aircraft hit the ground on its back and <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> ball of flame, killing all six crew and all 35 passengers. It was reported from RAF Abingdon that the pilot, Flight Lieutenant John Akin, had radioed that his aircraft was having control trouble before the radio went dead.|$|E
2500|$|Arlott's final Test {{commentary}} {{was on the}} Centenary Test between England and Australia at Lord's in 1980. At the end of {{his last}} session on the final day (2 September), he concluded with his customary phrasing [...] "nine runs off the over – 28 Boycott, 15 Gower, 69 for 2 – and after Trevor Bailey it will be Christopher Martin-Jenkins." [...] At the end of the following over, a public address announcement that Arlott had completed his final commentary session prompted the crowd to give Arlott an ovation. The entire Australian team in the field and the two England batsmen joined in, with Geoffrey Boycott removing his batting gloves to applaud. Later that day, after the match ended in a draw, he came onto the Lord's balcony to present the Man of the Match award. When he appeared, the crowd below again <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> spontaneous ovation that lasted for several minutes before he was finally able to speak and make the presentation to Kim Hughes.|$|E
2500|$|In 1280, a large {{store of}} {{gunpowder}} at Weiyang in Yangzhou accidentally caught fire, producing such a massive explosion that {{a team of}} inspectors at the site a week later deduced that some 100 guards had been killed instantly, with wooden beams and pillars blown sky high and landing {{at a distance of}} over 10 li (~2mi. or ~3km) away from the explosion, creating a crater more than ten feet deep. One resident described the noise of the explosion as if it [...] "was like a volcano erupting, a tsunami crashing. The entire population was terrified." [...] According to surviving reports, the incident was caused by inexperienced gunpowder makers hired to replace the previous ones, and had been careless while grinding sulfur. A spark caused by the grinding process came into contact with some fire lances which immediately started spewing flames and jetting around [...] "like frightened snakes." [...] The gunpowder makers did nothing as they found the sight highly amusing, that is until one fire lance <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> cache of bombs, causing the entire complex to explode. The validity of this report is somewhat questionable, assuming everyone within the immediate vicinity was killed.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, Stephen Frears read The Damned Utd while {{travelling}} to the Venice Film Festival. He {{enjoyed the}} book and talked with The Queen producer Andy Harries about it. He then sent it to Peter Morgan, with whom he also worked on The Queen, {{on the eve of}} that film's premiere in Venice; Morgan read it by the next morning. Morgan enjoyed it, stating, [...] "It deals with themes I love: Alcoholism and self-destruction and psychotic male competitiveness and treachery." [...] Development of the project continued through February 2007, when BBC Films executive producer Christine Langan, another producer of The Queen, became involved. Frears had Michael Sheen in mind for Clough right from the start. Sheen had appeared in three other Frears projects: Mary Reilly, The Deal and The Queen. He was chosen because of his physical resemblance to Clough. When Frears suggested to Sheen that he play the part, Sheen [...] "rolled his eyes and <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> wonderful impersonation" [...] of Clough. Sheen said Clough was [...] "one of those people who's decided he's going to shape {{the rest of the world}} in his image. Inevitably there's something in us that recognises that that's playing with fire and the gods will have to strike you down." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cronin {{also came}} to feel that [...] "If we {{consider}} the physical universe,... we cannot escape {{the notion of a}} primary Creator.... Accept evolution with its fossils and elementary species, its scientific doctrine of natural causes. And still you are confronted with the same mystery, primary and profound. Ex nihilo nihil, as the Latin tag of our schooldays has it: nothing can come of nothing." [...] This was brought home to him in London, where in his spare time he had organised a working boys' club. One day he invited a distinguished zoologist to deliver a lecture to the members. The speaker, adopting [...] "a frankly atheistic approach," [...] described the sequence of events leading to the emergence, [...] "though he did not say how," [...] of the first primitive life-form from lifeless matter. When he concluded, there was polite applause. Then, [...] "a mild and very average youngster rose nervously to his feet," [...] and with a slight stammer asked how there came to be anything in the first place. The naïve question took everyone by surprise. The lecturer [...] "looked annoyed, hesitated, slowly turned red. Then, before he could answer, the whole club <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> howl of laughter. The elaborate structure of logic offered by the test-tube realist had been crumpled by one word of challenge from a simple-minded boy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The third revised {{design was}} {{presented}} to the Commission of Fine Arts on July 17, 2008. Two firms had been hired by the memorial planners to assist the design team: Fluidity Design Consultants, which helped with the design of the star-shaped fountain; and Cloud Gehshan Associates, which worked on the glass panels and artworks. The first major change to the memorial design involved the star-shaped basin, which no longer overflowed into the triangular reflecting pool. Now the fountain overflowed itself, with water passing down its sides into a trough {{at the base of the}} structure. The overflow was designed to be a quiet one. The basin's underlying stone was no longer black granite, but the same grey granite as the rest of the plaza. The height of the star-shaped basin was also raised to [...] above the plaza, to make it a more visible and dramatic part of the memorial's design. (The height of the fountain permitted someone in a wheelchair to see the flame, but was also high enough to discourage a person from climbing into the water and approaching the flame.) The fountain was designed to be turned off in winter, although the basin would not be drained. A sensor system would detect if anyone climbed into the fountain's basin, and turn off the flame as a protective measure. The nature of the eternal flame had also been further refined. The new plan called for five stones to protrude slightly above the water. Just out of sight below the surface of the water, jets would allow natural gas to bubble to the surface. As the bubbles broke the surface, igniters hidden in the stones would cause the gas to <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> [...] high flame. Sensors would adjust the flow of gas and the operation of the igniters to accommodate weather (such as wind or rain).|$|E
