Failure in algebra is the # 1 trigger of {{dropouts}} in {{high school}} according to a former superintendent of Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) (Helfand, 2007). Too many urban students of color are failing or performing below basic in foundational mathematics. The author, a teacher at West High School, {{has been able to}} achieve different results with low income urban students in algebra. The author has used specific strategies that have helped the majority of his once low-performing students to consistently succeed in algebra and outperform their peers throughout the entire Grand District and state of California. The strategies used by the author have been integrated into an instructional model called C. <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>A.</b> T. <b>E.</b> This project focused on documenting the impact C. <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>A.</b> T. <b>E.</b> could have on the results other math teachers experienced with their students in foundational math classrooms, specifically, algebra and geometry. Furthermore, the study revolved around the issue of replicating the success the author has had with C. <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>A.</b> T. <b>E.</b> in other classrooms. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine if the implementation of C. <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>A.</b> T. <b>E.</b> in other teachers??? classrooms at West High School resulted in a majority of low income and underperforming students succeeding on district and statewide math assessments in algebra I and geometry.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that oral glucose tolerance is impaired in the immediate postexercise period. A double-tracer technique was used to examine glucose kinetics during a 2 -h oral glucose (75 g) tolerance test (OGTT) 30 min after exercise (Ex, 55 min at 71 ± 2 % of peak O 2 uptake) and 24 h after exercise (Rest) in endurance-trained men. The area under the plasma glucose curve was 71 % greater in Ex than in Rest (P = 0. 01). The higher glucose response occurred even though whole body rate of glucose disappearance was 24 % higher after exercise (P = 0. 04, main effect). Whole body rate of glucose appearance was 25 % higher after exercise (P = 0. 03, main effect). There were no differences in total (2 h) endogenous glucose appearance (<b>R</b> <b>a</b> <b>E)</b> or the magnitude of suppression of <b>R</b> <b>a</b> <b>E,</b> although <b>R</b> <b>a</b> <b>E</b> was higher from 15 to 30 min during the OGTT in Ex.

There were no differences in glucose clearance rate or plasma insulin responses between the two conditions. These results suggest that adaptations in splanchnic tissues by prior exercise facilitate greater glucose output from the splanchnic region after glucose ingestion, resulting in a greater glycemic response and, consequently, a greater rate of whole body glucose uptake. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The only {{national}} drug abuse prevention delivery system {{that supports the}} rapid diffusion of new prevention strategies and includes uniform training and credentialing of instructors who are monitored for quality implementation of prevention programming is the Drug Abuse Resistance Education network (D. <b>A.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>E.)</b> linking community law enforcement to schools. Analysis of the organizational structure and function of D. <b>A.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> provides <b>an</b> understanding of the essential parameters of this successful delivery system {{that can be used}} in the development of other types of national infrastructures for community-based prevention services. Information regarding organizational structure and function around funding issues, training, quality control and community relationships was gathered through telephone surveys with 50 state D. <b>A.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> coordinators (including two major cities), focus groups with local D. <b>A.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> officers and mentors, and interviews with national D. <b>A.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> office staff. Results The surveys helped identify several strengths inherent in the D. <b>A.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> program necessary for building a prevention infrastructure, including a well-defined organizational focus (D. <b>A.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> America), uniform training and means for rapid dissemination (through its organized training structure), continuing education mechanisms (through the state and national conference and website), mechanisms for program monitoring and fidelity of implementation (formal and informal), branding and, for several states, predictable and consistent financing. Weaknesses of the program as currently structured include unstable funding and the failure to incorporate components for the continual upgrading of curricula reflecting research evidence and "principles of prevention". Conclusion The D. <b>A.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> organization and service delivery network provides a framework for the rapid dissemination of evidence-based prevention strategies. The major strength of D. <b>A.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> is its natural affiliation to local law enforcement agencies through state coordinators. Through these affiliations, it has been possible for D. <b>A.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> to become established nationally within a few years and internationally within a decade. Understanding how this structure developed and currently functions provides insights into how other such delivery systems could be developed. </p...|$|R

40|$|Both the {{evaluations}} of D. <b>A.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) on individual sites, and the meta-analyses involving multiple sites report {{little or no}} evidence of deterrent effects. Overall, the research indicates that children who participate in the traditional D. <b>A.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> curriculum (which is implemented in the fifth or sixth grades) are {{just as likely to}} use drugs as are children who do not participate in the program. This same set of studies indicates there are some beneficial attitudinal outcomes of the D. <b>A.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> program, which includes replacing negative stereotypes of police with positive attitudes toward police, as well as collective and unified support of and involvement in the program by parents, teachers and police.

The C. <b>A.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> Program, which is used in grades kindergarten to grade 3 in many schools across Canada, was developed as a program for the prevention of child sexual abuse. In order to determine the impact that involvement with the C. <b>A.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> Program had on grade 3 students, and on their teachers and parents, a modified version of the Children's Assertiveness Inventory was administered to 443 students, 299 of whom had received instruction in the C. <b>A.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> Program and 144 of whom had not received such instruction. A Likert-type questionnaire was constructed and administered to 443 parents, 299 of whom had children in the C. <b>A.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> Program and 144 of whose children had no such experience. A similiar Likert-type questionnaire was constructed and administered to 50 primary teachers, 27 of whom had taught the C. <b>A.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> Program and 23 of whom did not have such an experience. [...] The C. <b>A.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> Program had no effect on children's perception of their ability to assert themselves with persons older than themselves. However, the C. <b>A.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> Program seems to have enhanced the students' ability to assert themselves in negative social situations with their peer group. In general, the study found that both parents and teachers had knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about child sexual abuse consistent with those advocated by 'experts' in this field. However, it appears that in some areas, knowledge, attitudes and beliefs are strengthed by participation in the C. <b>A.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> Program and in child sexual abuse orientation meetings. Also, there are some aspects of child sexual abuse that appear to challenge the understanding of both parents and teachers. [...] Generally, the study found significant support from both parents and teachers for school-based child sexual abuse prevention programs, and, in particular a strong endorsement of the C. <b>A.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> Program. However, some limitations of the Program are noted and some suggestions are made. [...] This Report concludes with a detailed summary of the results and a set of recommendations...|$|R
