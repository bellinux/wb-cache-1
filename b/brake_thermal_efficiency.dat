This study proves the possibility to achieve high loads, up to 16 bar Brake Mean Effective Pressure (BMEP), and ultra-low NOdx emissions, using turbo charging and dual fuel. Although the system shows great potential, it is obvious that the lack of inlet air pre heating is a drawback at low loads, where combustion efficiency suffers.

Bio-diesel is a renewable, inexhaustible and a clean burning fuel. Many {{studies have shown that}} properties of bio-diesel are very close to petro diesel. Bio-diesel can be used in diesel engine without modification. Bio-diesel has no aromatic, no-sulfur and contains 10 - 12 % oxygen by weight. These characteristics of bio-diesel reduce the harmful emissions of unburned hydrocarbons and CO, research has shown that NOx, emission is higher in case of bio-diesel fueled engine. Exhaust gas recirculation is an effective technique to reduce NOx.

The easiest way to introduce H 2 ICE vehicles is through converting engines to bi-fuel operation by mounting a port fuel injection (PFI) system for hydrogen.

40|$|De-inking sludge can be {{converted}} into useful forms of energy to provide economic and environmental benefits. In this study, pyrolysis oil produced from de-inking sludge through an intermediate pyrolysis technique was blended with biodiesel derived from waste cooking oil, and tested in a multi-cylinder indirect injection type CI engine. The {{physical and chemical properties}} of pyrolysis oil and its blends (20 and 30 vol. %) were measured and compared with those of fossil diesel and pure biodiesel (B 100). Full engine power was achieved with both blends, and very little difference in engine performance and emission results were observed between 20 % and 30 % blends. At full engine load, the brake specific fuel consumption on a volume basis was around 6 % higher for the blends when compared to fossil diesel. The <b>brake</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were about 3 - 6 % lower than biodiesel and were similar to fossil diesel. Exhaust gas emissions of the blends contained 4 % higher CO 2 and 6 - 12 % lower NOx, as compared to fossil diesel. At full load, CO emissions of the blends were decreased by 5 - 10 times. The cylinder gas pressure diagram showed stable engine operation with the 20 % blend, but indicated minor knocking with 30 % blend. Peak cylinder pressure of the 30 % blend was about 5 - 6 % higher compared to fossil diesel. At full load, the peak burn rate of combustion from the 30 % blend was about 26 % and 12 % higher than fossil diesel and biodiesel respectively. In comparison to fossil diesel the combustion duration was decreased for both blends; for 30 % blend at full load, the duration was almost 12 % lower. The study concludes that up to 20 % blend of de-inking sludge pyrolysis oil with biodiesel can be used in an indirect injection CI engine without adding any ignition additives or surfactants...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} water mixed with methanol as a fuel {{on the performance of}} a small 2 -cycle spark ignition engine. The water mixing ratio in methanol is varied from 0 to 20 % by weight. Experiments at various excess air ratios and ignition timings are carried out under a constant delivery ratio and a constant engine speed. The mean combustion pressure in the cylinder is measured with the pressure tap fixed in the cylinder head. We attempted to analyze characteristics of the combustion process using the indicated pressure diagram. The results show that the methanol fuel containing water up to 20 % is useful for improving the performance of a small 2 -cycle IS engine, for example, increased <b>brake</b> power and <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> and more compact mechanism...|$|R
40|$|In today’s {{modern world}} the {{internal}} combustion engine has a predominant role in stationary low power generation and a virtual monopoly in mobile applications. Concentrations emitted from the {{internal combustion engine}}s thus build up to levels sufficient to have adverse effects on plants and animals. From the literature we find that any technique employed to mitigate emissions has adverse effect on the performance. EGR is considered as a most efficient method to reduce the NOx exhausted. This method is employed to a single cylinder naturally aspirated DI diesel engine. The test is carried for different injection pressures and percentage of exhaust gas recirculation. Its effect on engine performance except for the smoke measurement is presented in this paper. There is a remarkable reduction in the NOx concentration but a marginal reduction in <b>brake</b> power and <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> are also observed...|$|R
