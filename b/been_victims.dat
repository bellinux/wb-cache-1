5|$|Although {{the police}} were sure murder had taken place, and {{that at least one}} of the four was guilty, they were {{uncertain}} whether they could secure a conviction. Police also suspected there had been other murders committed, but the lack of bodies hampered this line of enquiry. As news of the possibility of other murders came to the public's attention, newspapers began to publish lurid and inaccurate stories of the crimes; speculative reports led members of the public to assume that all missing people had <b>been</b> <b>victims.</b> Janet Brown went to the police and identified her friend Mary Paterson's clothing, while a local baker informed them that Jamie Wilson's trousers were being worn by Constantine Burke's son. On 19 November a warrant for the murder of Jamie Wilson was made against the four suspects.|$|E
5|$|Hunter {{was born}} in Rothesay, at 7 Tower Street, on the Isle of Bute. The date was 7 August 1877. He was the {{youngest}} child of five, born to William and Jeanie (née Stewart) Hunter. George, as he was then known, showed an aptitude for drawing when very young {{and when he was}} about thirteen, his mother arranged for him to have painting lessons with a lady acquaintance. In February 1892, Hunter's elder sister Catherine died. Shortly after, in March, another elder sibling, James, also died. Both were in their early twenties. It is thought they may have <b>been</b> <b>victims</b> of an influenza pandemic. William, the father, and Jeanie, seem already to have contemplated emigrating, because a home had been sold. Evidently, the tragic deaths sealed the matter, and the remaining family departed for California via New York on 1 September 1892, aboard the SS Ethiopia.|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{the best}} {{estimate}} of the incidence and prevalence of rape {{is provided by the}} National Violence Against Women study, published in 2000 and sponsored by the National Institute of Justice and the Centers for Disease Control 1. This study employed a sampling strategy that closely matched national demographics and found the following: • 14. 8 % of women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> of rape at some point during their lifetime • 2. 8 % of women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> of attempted rape at some point during their lifetime • 0. 3 % of women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> of rape during the previous 12 months, yielding an 8. 7 per 1000 “incidence rate” Extrapolating this incidence rate to the population of Metro Boston reveals the stark disparity between “official ” rape statistics and the reality of sexual violence. In 1998, there were 1, 687 rapes reported in all of Massachusetts, and 526 arrests were made 17. That same year, among the approximately 1. 75 million women in the Boston Metro area, there were actually 15, 225 rapes. The NIJ study findings described above closely match those of the Rape in America study 2, published in 1992, which found: • 13. 0 % of women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> of rape at some point during their lifetime • 0. 7 % of women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> of rape during the previous 12 months Two other prevalence studies have documented even higher victimization rates, probably due to the unique characteristics of their samples. A study of naval recruits published in 19993 found: • 36. 1 % of female recruits <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> of rape since the age of 14 • 9. 4 % of female recruits <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> of attempted rape since the age of 14 A study of a national sample of college students, published in 19874, found: • 15. 4 % of women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> of rape since the age of 14 • 12. 1 % of women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> of attempted rape since the age of 1...|$|R
