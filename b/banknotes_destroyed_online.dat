50|$|Money burning or burning {{money is}} the {{purposeful}} act of destroying money. In the prototypical example, <b>banknotes</b> are <b>destroyed</b> by literally setting them on fire. Burning money decreases {{the wealth of the}} owner without directly enriching any particular party. However, according to the quantity theory of money, because it reduces the supply of money it increases by the same amount the collective wealth of everyone else who holds money.|$|R

25|$|In the United States, {{banknotes}} last {{an average}} of three years until they are no longer fit for circulation, after which they are collected for destruction, usually recycling or shredding. A banknote is removed from the money supply by banks or other financial institutions because of everyday wear and tear from its handling. Banknote bundles are passed through a sorting machine that determines whether a particular note needs to be shredded, or are removed from the supply chain by a human inspector if they are deemed unfit for continued use – for example, if they are mutilated or torn. Counterfeit <b>banknotes</b> are <b>destroyed</b> unless they are needed for evidentiary or forensic purposes.|$|R

Why can’t people be more civil?” Tom, {{a member of}} another community, reported: “ … it took only one aggressive, {{insulting}} person to ruin the whole community for everyone else. ” Why is etiquette online important? As Internet settlers form cyber-communities, the importance of etiquette grows. Lack of etiquette is weakening sociability and even <b>destroying</b> <b>online</b> communities. Etiquette online is not just nice to have, it is necessary. Like the pioneers of the wild west, early Internet adopters were a rough and tumble gang. An occasional sarcastic comment, expletive, or confrontational challenge {{was part of the}} fun. But times have changed. Today’s settlers flock online in the millions. A single word aptly summarizes these settlers – ‘diverse’. These Internet users come from many cultures and walks of life. They arrive with a mix of expectations using a variety of technologies, which they access in different ways. The new settlers include children and adults, healthy and infirm, eager and reluctant...|$|R
50|$|A seventh {{series of}} Swiss {{banknotes}} {{was designed and}} printed in 1984, in parallel with the sixth series, but was never released. It formed the reserve series, to be released, for example, if the current series would suddenly become widely counterfeited. At first, almost no information was released on the series for security reasons, except for small fragments. However, after the eighth series was released, {{it was decided to}} improve the security features of the current series rather than develop a new reserve series. The details of the seventh series were later released, while the actual <b>banknotes</b> were <b>destroyed.</b> The designers were Roger Pfund and Elisabeth Pfund. They had originally won the competition for the design of the sixth series, but since the Swiss National Bank decided to use the design by Ernst and Ursula Hiestand instead, the Pfunds were charged with the design of the reserve series.|$|R

40|$|Phishing, {{a typical}} online {{identity}} theft, {{has become one}} of the most critical threats of on-line business. Most victims are deceived by forging authorized websites. Being cheated by fraudulent websites does not only mean the loss of money, but also the damage of online trust relationship. From the whole economic and social system’s point of view, the damage is not stopped at the point of <b>destroying</b> <b>online</b> trust relationship. In fact, the side effects of missing the business basis, trust relationship, will finally cause an economic slowdown. Undoubtedly, the final consequence will turn to be a tragedy. In order to protect users from this simple cheating attack, we collected and classified three types of phishing attacks on client side, server side and transmission media. In addition, we also selected and carefully experimented, from usability perspective, four representative anti-phishing toolbars, Google Safe Browsing, Netcraft antiphishing toolbar, SpoofGuard, and my own software Anti-phishing IEPlug. Additionally, we employed misuse-oriented method to illustrate how to design phishing-resistant information system at design or requirement stage. According to the results of these studies, we suggest that end users should trust and use anti-phishing software to protect themselves. Moreover, for ordinary users, it is also highly recommended to observe and report any suspicious websites and attempts. Meanwhile, it is always a good habit to carefully check URLs and certificate authorities of online banking websites. From the results of my antiphishing studies, it also shows that the war between phishers and anti-phishers never ends. Phishing techniques are constantly evolving, as well as existing phishing preventive client side applications’ own defects are not overcome yet. However, the study results are showing that phishing may be killed out at system design stage, e. g. by using misuse case method.

On {{reaching}} their final destination before [...] "transport" [...] to Germany and Austria, the Jews disembarked {{in the courtyard of}} the Schlosslager manor where the SS men wearing white coats and pretending to be medics waited for them with a translator released earlier from the Gestapo prison in Poznań. The victims were led to a large empty room and ordered to undress; their clothing stacked for disinfection. They were told that all hidden <b>banknotes</b> would be <b>destroyed</b> during steaming and needed to be taken out and handed over for safe-keeping.

A thesis (S- 1) of Indonesian Literature Faculty of Cultural Sciences, Diponegoro University. Advisor: Drs. Mujid F. Amin, M. Pd. and Riris Tiani, S. S., M. Hum The {{derivative}} form of word (<b>destroyed)</b> used in <b>online</b> {{media is}} not always present in the Indonesia Dictionary. This occurs because {{of the influence of}} standard and nonstandard languages that are dynamic, so the differences in the elements can changes the meaning. This study aims to describe form words of (destroyed) and their meanings in the sentence of online media. The type of data used is secondary data, which is obtained from the sentence of online media. The methode used is simak method with catat technique, then used agih method for data analysis with expansion, paraphrase, and substitution technique, while at the presentation stage of analysis used formal and informal methods. Based on this study, the result is: first, they are four types of affix in the word (destroyed) in sentence, that is prefix, suffix, confix, and affix combination. The meaning caused by affixation depend on the affix type formed it. The function of affix is to change word category. Second, there are five the forms of reduplication pattern on the word “hancur”in sentence, that is ((D+R) +-an), ((D+R) +se-nya), ((D+R) +me-kan), (R+(D+me-kan)), and (tidak+R). The meaning of reduplication and word category depend on the pattern that forms it. Third, there are one construction in the composition that is found that is verbs composition formed by the combination of verbs+verbs.

Pretreatment temperature, soaking time, and consistency of waste RMB paper were investigated {{to obtain the}} optimum repulping parameters. The results showed that when the pretreatment temperature was 80 oC, soaking time was 60 min, and consistency was 10 %, the repulping yield was 88. 1 %. The arithmetic and weighted mean lengths of fine pulp fibers from the optimum experiment were 0. 564 mm and 0. 785 mm, respectively, and the mean width was 22. 5 μm. Obvious kinks and broken ends, {{as well as a}} slight curl of fine pulp fibers were observed by analyses with a Morfi-compact fiber analyzer and a scanning electron microscope.

50|$|Gameplay {{is entirely}} online and {{consists}} of various game types (such as deathmatch, capture the flag, and others). Up to 10 players (five against five) can supposedly participate, and each player must have an Xbox, Xbox Live, and the special controller to play the game. However, at this time everywhere except Japan, most matches are limited to 3 vs. 3 with the some 4 vs. 4 and rare 5 vs. 5 combat. Players connecting with less than 100 kB/s up and 300 kB/s down are usually limited to 4 on 4 or 3 on 3 combat. There are a total of 10 new VT's introduced in this game, {{for a total of}} 31 different models, but it is worth mention that there is no single player mode available. After having their VT <b>destroyed</b> during an <b>online</b> match, the player must go through the entire start-up process again before re-spawning onto the battlefield.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{historical}} investigation into {{aspects of the}} formation of online society in China bctween 1997 and 2006. It considers online cultural production, online associating and online philanthropy, all of which started out as features of particular online communities and then spread out onto the wider web. The thesis follows how this evolution took place. The research argues that what is happening is a quasi-social mobilization in which the will power of individuals converge via informal associating online into a functioning, trend-setting whole. The thesis reveals, on the one hand, the self-consolidation, autonomy and order which organically developed in the cyberspace. Online communication could bring about deliberated norms and values, and contested cultural identities, and collective action grounded by the former two factors. However, the research also shows how external social structures set parameters for the development of online society autonomy. Furthermore, there is a contradiction between the autonomy of online society and the control {{of the power of the}} State. The State has repeatedly <b>destroyed</b> the growing <b>online</b> public sphere, channeling the online population's activities into apolitical practices such as entertaining themselves and group socializing. Two features of online association are revealed. First, in the socialization of online life, the individual participated in public affairs, which in turn improves the individual's capacity for doing so. By transforming the individual's passivity and inactivity, the quasi-social movement dismantles the soil in which authoritarian politics grow. On the other hand, online association is entertaining and made blander as a result of the purge of dissidents by the authorities. Online social activities per se conform to authority, instead of opposing it. The massive movement of online associating has produced is a stronger, slyer, yet submissive society.
