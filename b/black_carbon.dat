The net atmospheric heating due to aerosol absorption causes the air to warm and convect upwards, increasing the concentration of moisture in the mid-troposphere and providing positive feedback that stimulates further heating of aerosols.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Superhydrophobic {{conductive}} <b>carbon</b> <b>blacks</b> {{were prepared}} by covalent bonding of perfluorocarbon and perfluoropolyether chains on the conductive <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> surface. Perfluorodiacyl and perfluoropolyether peroxides {{were used as}} reagents for the chemical treatment. Their thermal decomposition produced respectively, perfluoroalkyl and perfluoropolyether radicals that directly bonded the polycyclic aromatic structure of <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> surface. Measurements of contact angles with water on molded pellets made with <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> powder demonstrated that water droplets were enduringly stable on the treated <b>carbon</b> <b>blacks.</b> Contact angle values were significantly high, exceeding the superhydrophobicity threshold.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> loading and type on the {{properties}} of ferrite filled natural rubber (NR) composites was investigated. The <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> loading used was from 0 to 50 phr and ferrite loading was fixed at 80 phr. <b>Carbon</b> <b>black</b> grades N 330 and N 660 were used in this work. The scorch time decreased {{with the addition of}} <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> in ferrite filled NR composites whereas the cure time increased. The tensile strength and elongation at break of ferrite filled natural rubber composites were found to decrease with the increase of both types <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> loading. However, the stress at 100 % elongation (M 100) and stress modulus at 300 % elongation (M 300) exhibit an increasing trend. The microstructure showed that filler dispersion of ferrite filled natural rubber composites become poorer with increasing <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> loading. The thermal stability was found to enhance with <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> loading. The swelling test indicated that the swelling percentage reduced with increasing <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> loading while at low loading enhanced the magnetic properties of the composites. The N 330 <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> filled NR composites showed longer scorch and cure times and better tensile properties, swelling resistance and magnetic properties but lower thermal stability than N 660 <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> filled NR composites.

40|$|Industrial {{exposure}} to <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> {{has occurred in}} the <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> production industry and in several user industries, including the rubber, paint and printing industries. The risks for cancer associated with these three exposure circumstances have been evaluated previously (IARC, 1982, 1989, 1996). The Working Group considered that the epidemiological evidence concerning the risk for cancer in user industries where there has been no attempt to identify which of the workers may have been exposed to <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> carries little weight in the present evaluation. Consequently, in this monograph, attention was restricted to those studies that explicitly attempted to identify workers who had been exposed to <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> Studies based on <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> production workers and some studies of workers in user industries satisfied this criterion. From {{the point of view of}} exposure patterns, the greatest potential for elucidating the carcinogenicity of <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> would seem to be in the <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> production industry. A further advantage of studies among producers is the fact that, in this industry, <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> was the dominant exposure in the industrial environment, whereas workers in other industries were often exposed to complex mixtures of substances, of which <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> may in some circumstances have been a relatively minor component. 2. 1 Industry-based studies Table 2. 1 summarizes industry-based studies including cohort analyses and nested case–control analyses of workers exposed to <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> 2. 1. 1 <b>Carbon</b> <b>black</b> production The occurrence of cancer among employees at <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> production facilities in the USA has been followed for different periods since 1935 and was initially described i...|$|R

25|$|The {{chemical}} structure of charcoal in terra preta soils {{is characterized by}} poly-condensed aromatic groups, that provide prolonged biological and chemical stability against microbial degradation; it also provides, after partial oxidation, the highest nutrient retention. Low temperature charcoal (but not that from grasses or high cellulose materials) has an internal layer of biological petroleum condensates that the bacteria consume, and is similar to cellulose in its effects on microbial growth. Charring at high temperature loses that layer and brings little increase in soil fertility. The formation of condensed aromatic structures depends on the method of manufacture of charcoal. The slow oxidation of charcoal creates carboxylic groups; these increase the cations' exchange capacity of the soil. The nucleus of <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> particles produced by the biomass remains aromatic even after thousands of years and presents the spectral characteristics of fresh charcoal. Around that nucleus and {{on the surface of}} the <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> particles, there are higher proportions of forms of carboxylic and phenolic carbons spatially and structurally distinct from the particle's nucleus. Analysis of the groups of molecules provides evidences both for the oxidation of the <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> particle itself, as well as for the adsorption of non-black carbon.|$|E

40|$|The {{electrical}} and mechanical behavior of <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> filled poly(vinyl acetate) latex-based and solution-based polymer composites was examined. A set of experiments {{were performed to}} distinguish composites with a segregated network (emulsion-based) from those with random dispersion (solution-based) of the filler. The percolation thresholds for the emulsion-based composites were near 1. 2 vol% <b>carbon</b> <b>black,</b> while the solution-based composites were around 8. 2 vol% <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> This difference {{is due to the}} segregated network formation, which leads to excluded volume effects in emulsion-based systems. This excluded volume created by the solid polymer particles forces the <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> particles into conductive pathways at low concentration. In the solution-based case, fully solvated polymer results in a random dispersion of <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> The segregated network composite also shows significant improvement in both electrical conductivity and storage modulus with low <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> loading, while the solution-based composite achieves significant property enhancements at higher <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> loading because of the greater percolation threshold. The effect of clay in both emulsion and solution-based composites with <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> was also studied by preparing composites with three clay concentrations (0. 2, 0. 4 and 2 wt%). In emulsion-based composites, low clay concentration reduced the percolation threshold from 1. 2 vol% to 0. 8 vol% <b>carbon</b> <b>black,</b> but with solution-based composites clay increased the percolation threshold from 8. 2 vol% to 11. 7 vol% <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> It is assumed that clay helps to force the <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> particles into the conductive pathways in the emulsion-based composites. In solution-base composites, clay improves the dispersion of <b>carbon</b> <b>black,</b> thereby destroying the <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> network and reducing conductivity and storage modulus. The storage modulus in emulsion-based composites improved with 0. 2 wt% clay but greater clay concentration resulted in a drop in modulus due to porosity from excess excluded volume effects...|$|R
