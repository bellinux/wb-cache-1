50|$|The family {{acquired}} further {{distinction in}} a legal aspect by a celebrated case decided in Lord Coke's time between Barbara, daughter of Sir Henry Beaumont, the eldest son of Sir Francis, the judge, and John, the second son of Sir Francis. Sir Henry had settled Grace Dieu upon his heirs male, with remainder to his brother John and his heirs male. Accordingly, on Sir Henry's death, John took possession, but Barbara being of tender years and ward to the king (James I) the question whether she was not entitled as tenant in tail under the original settlement was raised and elaborately argued {{with the result that}} a new point in the law of settlement was established, viz. that the <b>barring</b> <b>of</b> an <b>entail</b> by one <b>of</b> two joint tenants in tail, while it is inoperative {{to put an end to}} the entail, is yet sufficient to preclude the issue from inheriting.|$|R

40|$|Semantic {{inference}} {{is often}} modeled as application of entailment rules, which specify generation <b>of</b> <b>entailed</b> sentences {{from a source}} sentence. Efficient generation and representation <b>of</b> <b>entailed</b> consequents is a fundamental problem common to such inference methods. We present a new data structure, termed compact forest, which allows efficient generation and representation <b>of</b> <b>entailed</b> consequents, each represented as a parse tree. Rule-based inference is complemented with a new approximate matching measure inspired by tree kernels, which is computed efficiently over compact forests. Our system also makes use of novel large-scale entailment rule bases, derived from Wikipedia {{as well as from}} information about predicates and their argument mapping, gathered from available lexicons and complemented by unsupervised learning. ...|$|R
