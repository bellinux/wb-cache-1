50|$|The 40.8 meter {{tower is}} painted red and {{octagonal}} in shape. The light source is a 1000 watt <b>bulb,</b> <b>set</b> 38.5 meters above sea level, {{with a range}} of 17 miles. The lighthouse is also a part of an air traffic control system.|$|E
50|$|The {{projector}} {{is normally}} set at 90°, although 71° 31' may be used, {{in relation to}} the terrain. The projector consists of a 430 W incandescent <b>bulb</b> <b>set</b> in a weatherproof housing. Inside the housing are two mirrors; the first, above the bulb, reflects the light downwards to the second mirror, that then reflects the light upwards to the cloud. Both mirrors are focused to produce a high intensity beam of light that renders a visible spot on the base of the cloud.|$|E
50|$|The {{vigorous}} Galanthus plicatus 'Augustus' {{was named}} for Bowles by the plantswoman Amy Doncaster. Some other plants bearing his name have been introduced since his death. An example is Phlomis 'Edward Bowles', launched by Hiller Nursuries in 1967, which apparently derives from seeds from Myddelton. In February 2011 a single bulb of the pure white snowdrop G. p. 'E A Bowles', discovered at Myddelton in 2002, was sold on the internet auction site eBay for a record price of £357. This surpassed by almost £100 the previous record for a snowdrop <b>bulb,</b> <b>set</b> in 2008.|$|E

40|$|This is a lamp design. It expands {{my earlier}} {{lighting}} concepts, which seek to simultaneously transgress and accommodate the axioms of modernism {{in search of}} new forms of expression. In this piece a wire frame 'wastepaper basket' contains a light <b>bulb</b> <b>set</b> in the centre. Crumpled sheets of paper surround the light source; each sheet containing discarded sketch ideas for paper lights. The rejected sketch sheets function as the diffuser or shade. Process and product are intermingled; process becomes product and the outcome is both a product and a narrative about the trial and error of idea generation. The piece formulates a kind of perpetually renewed conceptual ideal {{and in a sense}} the representation of the quest for the perfect paper light shade becomes an icon for perfection. Evoking specific modernist axioms and texts ('Decoration and Crime' - Adolph Loos, 'Continuous Revolution' - Walter Gropius and 'Truth to Materials' - Constantine Brancusi) the piece paradoxically conforms to the ideology of Modernism while contradicting this ideology with its realised form...|$|E
40|$|Maintaining {{comfort in}} a home can be {{challenging}} in hot-humid climates. At the common summer temperature set point of 75 degrees F, the perceived air temperature can vary by 11 degrees F because higher indoor humidity reduces comfort. Often the air conditioner (AC) thermostat set point {{is lower than the}} desirable cooling level to try to increase moisture removal so that the interior air is not humid or "muggy. " However, this method is not always effective in maintaining indoor relative humidity (RH) or comfort. In order to quantify the performance of a combined whole-house dehumidifier (WHD) AC system, researchers from the U. S. Department of Energy's Building America team Consortium of Advanced Residential Buildings (CARB) monitored the operation of two Lennox AC systems coupled with a Honeywell DH 150 TrueDRY whole-house dehumidifier for a six-month period. By using a WHD to control moisture levels (latent cooling) and optimizing a central AC to control temperature (sensible cooling), improvements in comfort can be achieved while reducing utility costs. Indoor comfort for this study was defined as maintaining indoor conditions at below 60 % RH and a humidity ratio of 0. 012 lbm/lbm while at common dry <b>bulb</b> <b>set</b> point temperatures of 74 degrees - 80 degrees F. In addition to enhanced comfort, controlling moisture to these levels can reduce the risk of other potential issues such as mold growth, pests, and building component degradation. Because a standard AC must also reduce dry bulb air temperature in order to remove moisture, a WHD is typically needed to support these latent loads when sensible heat removal is not desired...|$|E

50|$|The XE uses a Leitz-Copal electronic, {{vertically}} traveling, metal blade {{focal plane}} shutter supporting exposure times of 1/1000 of a second to four seconds, plus <b>bulb</b> <b>setting.</b> In aperture priority auto-exposure mode, the shutter speed is varied steplessly; in manual mode, the shutter speeds are selected in whole stop increments. The camera has a very short shutter lag of about 38ms, among the best for an SLR regardless of manufacturer.|$|R
50|$|E12 is {{typically}} used for candelabra fixtures. E17 is also sometimes used, especially in small table lamps and novelty lighting, and occasionally {{the lights on}} newer ceiling fans. Christmas lights use various base sizes E17 for C9 bulbs, E12 for C7 bulbs, E10 for decades-old series-wired C6 <b>bulb</b> <b>sets</b> in the U.S., and an entirely different wedge base for T1¾ mini lights. For a short time early on, these mini lights were manufactured using E5 screw bases.|$|R
50|$|When {{the correct}} {{equipment}} is used {{such as a}} tripod and shutter release cable, the photographer can use long exposures to photograph images of light. For example, when photographing a subject try switching the exposure to manual and selecting the <b>bulb</b> <b>setting</b> on the camera. Once this is achieved trip the shutter and photograph your subject moving a flashlight or any small light in various patterns. Experiment with this outcome to produce artistic results. Multiple attempts are usually needed to produce a desired result.|$|R
50|$|Basically a {{rotary switch}} {{construction}} set, the Geniac contained six perforated masonite disks, {{into the back}} of which brass jumpers could be inserted. The jumpers made electrical connections between slotted brass bolt heads sitting out from the similarly perforated masonite back panel. To the bolts were attached wires behind the panel. The circuit comprised a battery, such wires from it to, and between, switch positions, wires from the switches to indicator flashlight <b>bulbs</b> <b>set</b> along the panel's middle, and return wires to the battery to complete the circuit.|$|R
50|$|The OM2S {{used the}} OM4 shutter {{mechanism}} {{but without the}} 1/2000 sec top speed, using instead 1/1000 as the maximum. It did, however, retain its mechanical <b>Bulb</b> <b>setting</b> as well as 1/60 second speed for use when batteries were depleted. This addressed a failing of the older all-electronic OM2 models which were unusable without batteries. Additionally, a basic level of weather-sealing was provided as a new feature in the OM2 line. While the older OM2 models could routinely withstand harsh conditions, they were never advertised as having any environmental protection features.|$|R
50|$|The {{shutter release}} {{is a small}} lever {{protruding}} from {{the right-hand side of}} the lens. Shutter speeds from 1/30s to 1/500s were available in automatic mode. It also provided a B (<b>bulb)</b> <b>setting,</b> though {{there is no way to}} attach a cable release. Apertures from 2.8 to 22 with constant shutter speed of 1/30 s could be set in manual mode, intended for use with an electronic flash. Flash sync is possible at all shutter speeds through the PC terminal. There is an accessory shoe provided, but it does not sync with flash.|$|R
5000|$|The Shutter {{speed is}} {{continuously}} adjustable and has labeled marks at 10, 15, 25, 50, and 100 with several unlabeled marks between these numbers. It {{also has a}} <b>Bulb</b> (B) <b>setting.</b>|$|R

50|$|LED sets {{can vary}} greatly. Common {{is a set}} of 60 (2 volts per bulb), but white LED sets use two {{circuits}} of 30 (4 volts per <b>bulb).</b> Multicolor <b>sets</b> may have special wiring, because red and yellow require less voltage than the newer blue-based ones (blue, emerald green and fluorescent white), but typically come in sets with a multiple of 35.|$|R
50|$|The {{ceilings}} were of {{a special}} design. The ceiling panels were suspended {{from the roof of}} the building and jutted out toward the sides of the auditorium, leaving a small cove next to the wall. A series of electric light <b>bulbs</b> were <b>set</b> in the hollow, not visible to the audience. Their glow fell on the patrons indirectly, giving the effect of space and freedom.|$|R
5000|$|Halloween is {{the most}} popular, with {{miniature}} light strings having black-insulated wires and semi-opaque orange <b>bulbs.</b> Later <b>sets</b> had some transparent purple bulbs (a representation of black, similar to blacklight), a few even have transparent green, or a translucent or semi-opaque lime green (possibly representing [...] as in Ghostbusters, or creatures like goblins or space aliens).

50|$|The Booster T Finder and Servo EE Finder {{were both}} {{essentially}} {{variations on the}} standard eye=level finder. The Booster T Finder contained an ultra-sensitive metering cell which could read as low as EV −3.5. Just like the metering range was shifted towards the dark side, this finder also shift the shutter speeds the camera provided towards the long end. Instead of the normal range (1 s - 1/2000 s), the Booster T Finder gave 60 s - 1/60 s. The shutter speed dial on the finder locked on to the camera's normal shutter dial and drove it through a coupling pin for the standard range of 1 s - 1/60 s. The finder also had a trigger button, which went through the finder down to the normal trigger button. When the Booster's shutter speed dial was turned further, towards longer times, the camera's dial stopped at the <b>B(ulb)</b> <b>setting,</b> and the finder kept the trigger button pressed {{for the duration of}} the exposure. The mechanics of this connection also resulted in the oddity that there was no 2 s setting, but 4, 3 and 1 seconds.|$|R
50|$|The EF used {{a unique}} shutter among Canon's 35mm SLRs: a Copal Square vertical-travel metal blade focal plane shutter. Unusually, long {{exposures}} (from 1 second to 30 seconds) were electronically controlled, while shorter ones (1/1000 second to 1/2 second) were mechanically controlled. This was very useful in conserving battery power, and allowed one {{to use the}} camera even with dead batteries. The light metering system's power switch turned on the meter, removed the lock from the shutter trigger button and let the film advance lever pop out 15 degrees from the camera body, all in one flick of the thumb.In the axis of the main switch, a multiple exposure button is located. Pressing this while cocking the shutter prevents advancing the film. The frame counter is also blocked, thus preserving the correct frame count.At the time, most cameras did not support longer exposure times than about one second, without having to use the <b>bulb</b> <b>setting.</b> Maybe this was why Canon placed a red LED {{to the left of}} the pentaprism, and had the LED flashing as long as the electronic shutter timer was running. The LED was also used for battery check.|$|R

5000|$|Flowering tea or {{blooming}} tea (...) {{consists of}} a bundle of dried tea leaves wrapped around one or more dried flowers. These are made by binding tea leaves and flowers together into a <b>bulb,</b> then <b>setting</b> them to dry. When steeped, the bundle expands and unfurls {{in a process that}} emulates a blooming flower, and the flowers inside emerge as the centerpiece. Typically they are sourced from the Yunnan province of China. Flowers commonly used in flowering teas include globe amaranth, chrysanthemum, jasmine, lily, hibiscus, and osmanthus.|$|R
5000|$|Battery-powered sets {{typically}} come in 10 or 12, and can use standard 2.5 to 3.5-volt bulbs {{because they}} run two batteries, totaling three volts or less. LEDs {{are becoming increasingly}} common as they greatly prolong battery life, but because they also last longer they are often soldered directly to the wires, making up {{for some of the}} increased cost of the newer LEDs. [...] "Rice lights" [...] are often made this way as well, and likewise may also have more <b>bulbs</b> per <b>set,</b> as they draw somewhat less power per bulb than other incandescent lamps.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earpiece}} of Millikan's oximeter (an open photocell-lamp assembly manufactured commercially by Coleman Electric) {{contained an}} incandescent light <b>bulb,</b> a <b>set</b> {{of red and}} green filters, and a selenium barrier level photocell. According to Millikan's early statements, light absorbance of green light was independent of blood oxygen level, absorbance of red light depended on it. [...] However, in 1942 {{it was found that}} the flesh of human ear absorbs almost all green light. [...] "Green light" [...] sensed by Millikan's photocell was actually invisible infrared light emitted by the lamp and unaffected by green filter.|$|R
50|$|The later Magicube (or X-Cube) {{retained}} the four-bulb format, and was superficially {{similar to the}} original Flashcube. However, the Magicube did not require electrical power. Each <b>bulb</b> was <b>set</b> off by a plastic pin in the cube mount that released a cocked spring wire within the cube. This wire struck a primer tube {{at the base of}} the bulb, which contained a fulminate, which in turn ignited shredded zirconium foil in the flash. Magicubes could also be fired by inserting a thin object, such as a key or paper clip, into one of the slots in the bottom of the cube.|$|R
50|$|The LightKeeper Pro's Quick Fix Trigger is used {{to break}} down the oxide coating of the bulb shunt, {{bypassing}} it permanently and allowing the rest of the <b>bulbs</b> in the <b>set</b> to illuminate normally.

40|$|Discolaimus constrictus sp. n. is {{differentiated}} from D. mucurubanus Loof, 1964, {{the only}} other species in the genus in which the basal <b>bulb</b> is <b>set</b> off by a constriction, by its larger size, relatively shorter oesophagus, relatively shorter tail and more posteriorly situated vulva.

A large population of D. monoplanus Heyns, 1963 is described from Namibia. The remarkable similarity between D. monoplanus, D. texanus Cobb, 1913 and D. brevis Siddiqi, 1964 is pointed out, and the biometrics of all recorded populations of these three species are tabulated and briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{explore the}} {{possibility}} of pathological change in the common carotid artery at the bifurcation and in the internal carotid artery beyond the bifurcation which could contribute to a reduced diastolic pressure as observed in primary open angle glaucoma. Design Duplex ultrasonic examinations of carotid bifurcations were conducted on 80 patients. Carotid artery defects were allocated into three types: no demonstrable flow defects, internal carotid artery abnormalities and disease in the carotid <b>bulb.</b> <b>Setting</b> Bristol Royal Infirmary Vascular Laboratory. Participants Eighty patients (mean age 69. 6 years) providing a total of 160 sides to the analysis. Main outcome measures An estimated central retinal artery pressure, intraocular pressure and field loss were recorded for each side measured. Results Doppler investigations revealed significant levels of pathological change in the internal carotid distinct from changes at the carotid bulb. The disease revealed in the internal carotid artery {{was significantly associated with}} intraocular pressure (p[*]=[*] 0. 032), with an effect small to medium in magnitude. The Q 2 measure, derived from mean arterial pressure and intraocular pressure, was also substantively associated with disease in the internal carotid artery. Both intraocular pressure and the Q 2 measure effectively discriminated between groups, with field loss providing rather less discriminating capability. There was a strong trend towards a higher intraocular pressures and a greater visual field loss with internal carotid artery disease. Conclusions Pathological changes in the extra cranial carotid artery in primary open angle glaucoma exceed those in the arteries classified as normal. The presence of disease specifically in the internal carotid artery emphasised the need for a mechanism for the evaluation of the internal carotid apart from the carotid bulb. A basis for clarifying the presence of an ischaemic zone is proposed...|$|R

40|$|In the {{olfactory}} <b>bulb</b> the <b>sets</b> of mitral {{cells that}} project their apical dendrite {{to the same}} glomerulus represent unique functional networks. While {{it is known that}} mitral cells release vesicular glutamate from their apical tuft it is believed that the resultant self-excitation (SE), transmitted via dendritic gap junctions, is the main form of lateral transmission within the mitral cell assembly. In this study we used simultaneous whole-cell recordings from mitral cell pairs to show that a direct form of chemical lateral excitation (LE) provides a means of mitral cell–mitral cell communication. In contrast to the ubiquitous expression and robust nature of SE, the efficacy of glutamatergic LE between mitral cells is highly variable and mediated by calcium-impermeable AMPA receptors. We also find that the strength of LE is bi-directionally modulated, in a homeostatic manner, by sniffing-like patterns of presynaptic activity. Since these changes last many minutes we suggest that such mitral cell–mitral cell interactions provide the glomerular network with a locus for olfactory plasticity and a potential mechanism for receptive field modulation...|$|R
