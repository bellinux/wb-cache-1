5|$|Historically, among certain Asian and Native American {{cultures}} {{the family}} structure {{consisted of a}} grandmother and her children, especially daughters, who raised their own children together and shared child care responsibilities. Uncles, brothers, and other male relatives sometimes helped out. Romantic relationships <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women were formed and dissolved with little impact on the children who remained in the mother's extended family.|$|E
5|$|History {{is often}} {{analyzed}} with contemporary ideologies; Ancient Greece {{as a subject}} enjoyed popularity by the ruling class in Britain during the 19th century. Based on their social priorities, British scholars interpreted ancient Greece as a westernized, white, and masculine society, and essentially removed women from historical importance. Women in Greece were sequestered with each other, and men with men. In this homosocial environment, erotic and sexual relationships between males were common and recorded in literature, art, and philosophy. Hardly anything is recorded about homosexual activity between women. There is some speculation that similar relationships existed between women and girls. The poet Alcman used the term aitis, as the feminine form of aites—which was the official term for the younger participant in a pederastic relationship. Aristophanes, in Plato's Symposium, mentions women who love women, but uses the term trepesthai (to be focused on) instead of eros, which was applied to other erotic relationships <b>between</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women.|$|E

Eleazar ben Azariah derived from the verse: [...] "From all your sins before God you shall be cleansed" [...] (Book of Leviticus,16:30) - for sins <b>between</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> God Yom Kippur atones, but for sins <b>between</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> his fellow Yom Kippur does not atone until he appeases his fellow.|$|R

Another poll conducted in mid-August by the Pew Research Center found Johnson supported by about 10% of registered voters. Of Johnson supporters, more than 60% identified as independent and more than 70% were younger than fifty years old.

5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} is rare, with {{an estimated}} 3-4 cases per million annual incidence in adults. While it may occur in all age groups, it is most common in the third decade. 75% are female. Given that older studies show no difference in incidence <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women, {{it has been suggested}} that the use of oral contraceptives in women is behind the disparity between the sexes. A 1995 report from Saudi Arabia found a doubled incidence at 7 cases per 100,000; this was attributed to the fact that Behçet's disease, which increases risk of CVST, is more common in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|In 1921 Margaret Mackworth, now {{the second}} Viscountess Rhondda, {{launched}} the Six Point Group, an action group that focused {{heavily on the}} equality <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women {{and the rights of}} the child. Mackworth continued to strive towards equality for women and {{emerged as one of the}} leading feminist campaigners in Britain during the inter-war period. She established a number of women's organisations, pressure groups and launched the influential feminist journal Time and Tide. She also made an unsuccessful bid to gain entry into the House of Lords, fighting against a 1922 ruling that barred the admission of women.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the latest}} {{aggregated}} {{research has found}} {{no difference in the}} prevalence of self-harm <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women. This is in contrast to past research which indicated that up to four times as many females as males have direct experience of self-harm. However, caution is needed in seeing self-harm as a greater problem for females, since males may engage in different forms of self-harm (e.g., hitting themselves) which could be easier to hide or explained as the result of different circumstances. Hence, there remain widely opposing views as to whether the gender paradox is a real phenomenon, or merely the artifact of bias in data collection.|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores how Herman Melville's {{depiction}} of the relationship <b>between</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> Wilderness in his collection of short stories, The Piazza Tales, critiques the social reform movements of the mid-nineteenth century. By highlighting how Melville's portrayal of the relationship <b>between</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> Wilderness parallels that seen in Early American survey writing texts such as Notes on the State of Virginia as well as midnineteenth century nature writing texts such as Walden, this thesis asserts that Melville is showing how {{the evolution of the}} relationship <b>between</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> Wilderness retains an inherent level of subjugation. Similarly, by showing how Melville's text parallels the relationship <b>between</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> Wilderness with that of <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> subjugated <b>Man,</b> this thesis suggests that Melville was making a claim that, due to the inherent subjugation that exists within the American social structure, the social reform movements of the mid- 19 th century would, ultimately, be ineffective-a reality which is apparent in the persistence of social, racial, and economical stratification in early 21 st century America. Chapter 1 synthesizes G. W. F. Hegel's Master-Slave Dialectic and Bill Brown's "Thing Theory" in order to demonstrate how Melville's {{depiction of}} the relationship <b>between</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> Wilderness mirrors the relationship <b>between</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> Subjugated <b>Man.</b> Chapter 2 explores the parallels between Thomas Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia, Melville's {{depiction of the}} relationship <b>between</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> Wilderness in "The Piazza," "The Lightning Rod Man," "The Encantadas," and "The Belltower," and the treatment of subjugated peoples in pre-Westward Movement America.

5|$|Primarily a coming-of-age story (Bildungsroman) {{and family}} saga, the novel chronicles {{the effect of}} a mutated gene on three generations of a Greek family, causing momentous changes in the protagonist's life.

5|$|As in the Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{does not}} {{highlight}} the differences <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women {{as much as}} she emphasizes the importance of virtue in Original Stories. Moreover, she defines virtue {{in such a way that}} it applies to both sexes. Traditionally, as Kelly explains, virtue was tied to femininity and chastity, but Wollstonecraft’s text rejects this definition and argues instead that virtue should be characterized by reason and self-control. Myers has also pointed out that Mrs. Mason’s desire to instill rationality in her charges is potentially liberating for women readers and their daughters as such a pedagogy was in direct contrast to much that was being written at the time by conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and philosophers such as Rousseau, who asserted the intellectual weakness of women and the secondary status of their gender.|$|E
5|$|In 15–16th-century French and English {{depictions of}} {{relationships}} between women (Lives of Gallant Ladies by Brantôme in 1665, John Cleland's 1749 erotica Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure, L'Espion Anglais by various authors in 1778), writers' attitudes spanned from amused tolerance to arousal, whereupon a male character would participate to complete the act. Physical relationships between women were often encouraged; men felt no threat as they viewed sexual acts between women to be accepted when men were not available, and not comparable to fulfillment that could be achieved by sexual acts <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women. At worst, if a woman became enamored of another woman, she became a tragic figure. Physical and therefore emotional satisfaction was considered impossible without a natural phallus. Male intervention into relationships between women was necessary only when women acted as men and demanded the same social privileges.|$|E
