5|$|In mid-1815 Austen {{moved her}} work from Egerton to John Murray, a better known London publisher, who {{published}} Emma in December 1815 {{and a second}} edition of Mansfield Park in February 1816. Emma sold well <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> edition of Mansfield Park did poorly, and this failure offset most of the income from Emma.

5|$|The club's dilemma was acute: the FA {{no longer}} {{approved}} of large crowds at The Nest, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> season was just weeks away.

5|$|According to Tino's account, {{on the day}} of the election, Selvo was {{attending}} mass for the funeral of the late Doge at the new monastery church of San Nicolò built under Domenico Contarini on Lido, an island in the Venetian Lagoon. The location was ideal for the funeral of a Doge not only because St Mark's Basilica was under construction at the time, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> church was also spacious enough to hold a fairly large number of people. The location also proved ideal for the election of a new Doge for the very same reasons.|$|E
5|$|After {{his playing}} career, McBride retired to Florissant, Missouri, where he briefly owned a liquor store.

5|$|After {{visiting his}} ancestral home in Suzhou, Pei created a design {{based on some}} simple but nuanced {{techniques}} he admired in traditional residential Chinese buildings. Among these were abundant gardens, integration with nature, and consideration {{of the relationship between}} enclosure and opening. Pei's design included a large central atrium covered by glass panels that functioned much like the large central space in his East Building of the National Gallery. Openings of various shapes in walls invited guests to view the natural scenery beyond. Younger Chinese who had hoped the building would exhibit some of Cubist flavor for which Pei had become known were disappointed, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> hotel found more favour with government officials and architects.|$|E
5|$|Although now 67 {{years old}} and in {{indifferent}} health, Bottomley tried to resurrect his business career. He raised sufficient capital {{to start a new}} magazine, John Blunt, as a rival to John Bull, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> venture lasted {{little more than a year}} before closing, having lost money from the start. In September 1929 he began an overseas lecture tour, which failed utterly, as did an attempt at a British tour during which he was received with indifference or hostility. By 1930 he was again bankrupt; his wife Eliza died that year, after which Bottomley's former son-in-law Jefferson Cohn evicted him from The Dicker. For the remaining years of his life he lived with his long-time mistress, the actress Peggy Primrose, whom Bottomley, in his years of riches, had vainly tried to promote to stardom.|$|E
5|$|Andrew {{was made}} canon in the Chapter of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Warmia on 16 September 1581. The canons {{and the elderly}} bishop, Marcin Kromer, had been opposed to Andrew's appointment, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> papal nuncio, Alberto Bolognetti, the {{chancellor}} of Poland, Jan Zamoyski, and Stephen Báthory persuaded one of the canons to abdicate in favor of Andrew. However, the canons, along with the Estates of Royal Prussia, prevented Andrew's promotion to coadjutor bishop {{saying that he was}} too young. At the nuncio's initiative, Andrew was elected provost of the Monastery of Miechów in spring 1583.|$|E

50|$|A second line, in {{the western}} parts of Djursholm, was opened in 1910, {{terminating}} in Altorp.

5|$|Barnes was {{selected}} for New South Wales for the opening match of the 1937–38 season against Queensland making 68 in a rain-affected match. Against the touring New Zealanders, Barnes fell just short of his maiden first-class century, scoring 97. He appeared to have reached the landmark when scoring 127not out against Western Australia, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> South Wales Cricket Association retrospectively deemed the match to be not of first-class status, angering Barnes. He finally scored his maiden first-class century (110) against Victoria in {{the final game of}} the season, completing his hundred while bleeding profusely after being struck on the jaw by a ball delivered by Ernie McCormick. As a result of his performances over the season (scoring over 800 runs, averaging 50.56), Barnes {{was selected}} as the youngest member of the Australian cricket team to tour England in 1938.|$|E
5|$|By 2005, the disused eastern {{trackbed}} {{was filled}} with rubble, brambles and weeds, and the station had acquired a bad reputation due to muggings {{and the use of}} illegal drugs on the station premises. A community garden project, Eastside Roots, was set up in the disused trackbed by local permaculture enthusiast Nick Ward. It was built using sustainable materials, including bricks dug out during the construction of the Cabot Circus shopping centre. The project led to a general improvement of the station ambience, and residents were more willing to use it. The footbridge was replaced in 2013 to allow for electrification of the line, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>new,</b> higher, bridge angered local residents who felt it infringed on their privacy.|$|E
5|$|By mid 1945, the {{economic}} drain on Britain {{due to her}} sustained war effort was becoming critical, and a new proposal, with an armour arrangement similar to the modernized HMS Renown, christened 'Design X', was submitted by a design committee headed by Admiral Servaes to the DNC. 'Design X', along with the earlier preferred 'B3' variant Battleship design were further refined through October 1945, when further design work was informally suspended on all <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> Mk III 16 inch turret. This work too was finally cancelled by the First Sea Lord in late 1949 and brought a final end to battleship design and construction for the Royal Navy.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland's first regular-season game {{took place}} September 6, 1946 at Cleveland Municipal Stadium against the Miami Seahawks before a then-record crowd of 60,135.

With Brown at the helm, the team won {{all four of the}} AAFC's championships from 1946 until its {{dissolution}} in 1949, amassing a record of 52 wins, four losses and three ties. This included the 1948 season, in which the Browns became the first unbeaten and untied team in professional football history. The Browns had few worthy rivals among the AAFC's eight teams, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York Yankees and San Francisco 49ers were their closest competition.|$|E
