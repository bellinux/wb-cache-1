5|$|Flowering {{may take}} some years from seed; a minimum of four years is average. <b>Buying</b> <b>an</b> {{advanced}} plant may hasten this process, as will getting a cutting-grown plant. Banksia ericifolia can be propagated easily by seed, {{and is one of}} the (relatively) easier banksias to propagate by cutting. Named cultivars are by necessity propagated by cuttings as this ensures that the plant produced bears the same attributes as the original plant.|$|E

Meanwhile, Jack reconnects {{with a friend}} from high school, Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), and ponders the possibility of romance as Nancy's marriage is falling apart. When Liz ends up <b>buying</b> <b>an</b> expensive necktie that Jack already owns, they agree to spend zero dollars on their gifts. Jack gets Liz a program from her performance of The Crucible framed in wood from her high school stage — and does not reimburse his office assistant, Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy) for fuel costs. In return, Liz calls in a bomb threat to Penn Station, keeping Nancy in New York, and finally Jack arranges for Liz to fulfill her dream of meeting Larry Wilcox as Officer Jon Baker from the show CHiPs.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps the {{significance}} of the protests was the formation of Shareholders United Against Murdoch, more commonly known as Manchester United Supporters' Trust today, by journalist Michael Crick. Working alongside IMUSA (Independent Manchester United Supporters Association), their joint aim was to seek a reference of the merger by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Both groups therefore submitted papers to the Office of Fair Trading, stressing the importance of why the merger shouldn’t be carried out. IMUSA in particular argued that BSkyB’s main intention was not that of United’s but their already dominant position. Sky Television’s relevant market was premium subscription channels and by <b>buying</b> <b>an</b> established Premier League team when they already had rights to the division was purely for financial gain. Moreover, Manchester United’s market was on the pitch and an acquisition by a media organisation– particularly one run by Murdoch– may create detrimental damage to the sport in the long term.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo better {{understand}} the reasons why households have no intention to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car, a sample of 980 respondents, living in Xian, China was asked to specify the reasons why they do not wish <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car. A probit model was estimated to identify households {{who did not have}} the intention to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car, based on their socio-demographic profile and living conditions. Because only these respondents could give the reasons why they do not wish to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car, this selection model was linked with a multinomial logit model to estimate the probability that a particular reason for not <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> car mentioned. Results indicate that socio-demographic variables, type and size of the house and non-availability of parking space have significant effects on car purchase decisions. Main reasons for not <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> car are related to costs considerations, parking difficulties and congestion...|$|R

5|$|Regular pruning is {{important}} to give the plant an attractive habit and prevent it from becoming leggy. As most cultivated forms of this species have a lignotuber, dormant buds exist below the bark that respond to pruning or fire, and hard-pruning is possible almost to ground level as a plant can readily sprout from old wood. This {{is not the case}} for var.cunninghamii which should not be pruned below foliage. Flowering may take up to eight years from germination; <b>buying</b> <b>an</b> advanced plant may hasten this process, as will getting a cutting-grown plant. Banksia spinulosa can be propagated easily by seed, {{and is one of the}} (relatively) easier banksias to propagate by cutting. Named cultivars are by necessity propagated by cuttings as this ensures that the plant produced bears the same attributes as the original plant.|$|E
5|$|Áleman died in 1951, and the County soon {{backed down}} from its road and bridge plan. His widow, Elena Santeiro Garcia, added to her Cape Florida {{property}} by <b>buying</b> <b>an</b> ocean-to-bay strip {{that had been}} part of the Matheson property. It included a canal dug by William Matheson in the 1920s, extending from the bay across most of the island. The land north of the canal was developed as part of the present-day Village of Key Biscayne. Garcia sold the Cape Florida property in 1957 for US$9.5 million, but the buyer defaulted and died the next year. Garcia sold the property again, for US$13 million. Development started on a model community' of luxury homes and resort properties. By 1962 the new developers were in financial trouble, and the property reverted again to Garcia in 1963.|$|E

30|$|Interestingly, the {{triangular}} structure is often exploited for rhetorical reasons, {{in particular in}} advertisements. A commercial slogan (popular in the 1980 s) such as “Don’t <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car, <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> Saab” has a real impact. Here the sentence initially understood as “Don’t <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car 0 … ” yields a contradiction as a Saab is a car 0. Reinterpreted as “Don’t <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car 1 …” (in which car 1 is the class of cars that are not Saab), it gets the exclusive interpretation. The cognitive effort is worthwhile in terms of effect as the hearer ends up with “buy a Saab” and “don’t <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car {{that is not a}} Saab”.|$|R

The main developers of the system were Rolf Skår, Per Bjørge, Lars Monrad-Krohn and Yngvar Lundh. SAM 2 was the first in Europe and among the first three in the world which used integrated circuits. The project was risky, as TSS originally had proposed <b>buying</b> <b>an</b> American computer and NDRE would have to buy such a computer if SAM 2 failed.|$|E

Another provision was the opt-out clause after the 2009 season, meaning that should he decide so, Beckham was free to leave the club after completing year three of his five-year contract.

While the delivery of coal to local homes ended in 1947, the railroad continued to haul about 470 cars per year of coal to supply the Penn State power plant.
