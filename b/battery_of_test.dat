40|$|Measurements of {{endogenous}} serotonin and the thrombin-induced serotonin release {{reaction in}} platelet concentrates {{were compared with}} other methods of quality control: particle counting and pH and gas analyses. A discrepancy between the serotonin release reaction and the other data was ob-served after seven days of storage.

There was a significant positive correlation between endog-enous serotonin content and the thrombin-induced serotonin secretion after seven days of storage.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{large-scale}} eigenvalue problems, methods of Davidson type such as Jacobi-Davidson can be competitive with respect to other types of algorithms, especially in some particularly difficult situations such as computing interior eigenvalues or when matrix factorization is prohibitive or highly inefficient. However, these types of methods are not generally available {{in the form of}} high-quality parallel implementations, especially for the case of non-Hermitian eigenproblems. We present our implementation of various Davidsontype methods in SLEPc, the Scalable Library for Eigenvalue Problem Computations.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} a new wavelet {{shrinkage}} technique is proposed and investigated. When data {{consist of a}} multiplicity of related noisy signals, we propose a wavelet-based shrinkage estimation procedure to summarize all data components into a single regularized and representative signal ("base-line"). This fusion of information from different runs is done via Stein-type shrinkage rule resulting from an empirical Bayes argument. The proposed shrinkage estimators maximize the predictive density under appropriate model assumptions on the wavelet coefficients. Features of this model-induced shrinkage are that it is "block-vertical " and local in time. The method, called VERTISHRINK, is evaluated on a <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> signals under various signal-to-noise ratios and various number of vector components.

Holland's genetic algorithm combined {{with the concept of}} niche and speciation already showed success in such difficult problems. Some implementations of this concept exist, but the effective ones all lack flexibility by requiring either previous knowledge about the function to optimize or by imposing some fixed external schedule of exploration. We present an implementation of this concept using minimum spanning trees that is compared with a previous algorithm on random choices of input parameters. Our proposal does not require any a priori knowledge about the function. Two approaches using the minimum spanning trees are studied, one of which [...] the biggest proportion method (BPM) [...] outperforms its competitor on the <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> problems and shows its capability of automatically adapting to the function to optimize...|$|E

To {{examine the effects}} of BPA exposure during pregnancy, we performed studies using the BeWo trophoblast cell line, placental explant cultures, placental perfusions and skin diffusion models, all of human origin. Results showed BPA cytotoxicity in BeWo cells with an apparent EC 50 at 100 - 125 microM. BPA exposure significantly increased beta-hCG secretion and caspase- 3 expression in placental explants at an environmentally relevant concentration of 1 nM. In the transport studies, a rapid transfer of BPA was observed across the term placentae and the BeWo cell monolayer. Further, transdermal transport of BPA was observed. These results indicate that fetal BPA exposure through placental exchange occurs with potential adverse implications for placental and fetal development.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the fitness levels and the postural and balance deficits with a specific test battery. Methods: Fifty-six subjects were enrolled in this study. Thirty-nine healthy subjects were included in the control group and seventeen in the juvenile idiopathic arthritis group. All subjects were evaluated using a posturography system. The fitness level was evaluated with a <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> (Abalakov test, sit-up test, hand grip test, backsaver sit and reach, the toe touch test). An unpaired t-test was used to determine differences.

40|$|The Remez {{penalty and}} {{smoothing}} algorithm (RPSALG) is a unified framework for penalty and smoothing methods for solving min-max convex semi-infinite programing problems, whose convergence was analyzed {{in a previous}} paper {{of three of the}} authors. In this paper we consider a partial implementation of RPSALG for solving ordinary convex semi-infinite programming problems. Each iteration of RPSALG involves two types of auxiliary optimization problems: the first one consists of obtaining an approximate solution of some discretized convex problem, while the second one requires to solve a non-convex optimization problem involving the parametric constraints as objective function with the parameter as variable. In this paper we tackle the latter problem with a variant of the cutting angle method called ECAM, a global optimization procedure for solving Lipschitz programming problems. We implement different variants of RPSALG which are compared with the unique publicly available SIP solver, NSIPS, on a <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> problems.

40|$|While factor {{analysis}} {{is one of}} the most often used techniques in psychometrics, comparing or combining solutions from different factor analyses can be cumbersome even though combining factors is necessary in several situations. For example, when applying multiple imputation (to account for incompleteness) or in case of multilevel data (where a simple solution is the application of multiple outputation) often tens or hundreds of results have to be combined into one final solution. While different solutions have been in use, we propose a simple and easy to implement solution to match factors from different analyses based on factor congruence. A modified Tucker's congruence coefficient is used to match factors. To demonstrate this method, the Big Five Inventory data collected under the auspices of the Divorce in Flanders study was analysed combining multiple imputation with multiple outputation and {{factor analysis}}.
