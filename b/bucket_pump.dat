2500|$|Although its date of {{construction}} is unknown, the London and North Eastern Railway Company built a small pumping station {{to the west of}} Torksey lock. It contained a steam-powered beam engine, which was probably made by Davy Brothers of Sheffield, and drove a double-acting <b>bucket</b> <b>pump.</b> It was situated close to the land drainage pumping station, which pumps into the tidal part of the Fossdyke, draining some [...] of low-lying land to the south of Torksey. Its job was to maintain the water levels in the navigation, but it was demolished in 1936, and no traces of it remain. A new pumping station at a similar location was commissioned in 1974. This forms part of the Trent Witham Ancholme transfer scheme. A pumping station at Short Ferry on Barlings Eau pumps water through an [...] pipeline to Toft Newton reservoir, on {{the upper reaches of the}} Ancholme. The water is used to maintain the flow and level of the Ancholme during the summer months and other dry periods. When there is insufficient water in Barlings Eau and the Witham, Torksey pumping station transfers water from the Trent through a short pipeline into Foss Dyke. From there it flows for [...] along the waterway to Brayford Pool and so into the Witham, to supplement the water available for pumping.|$|E
50|$|Pumping {{engines of}} this vintage used a {{vertical}} pump rod, with a <b>bucket</b> <b>pump</b> {{at the bottom}} of the shaft. This could lift water from an appreciable depth, developed for the needs of Cornish tin mining, but they had only low delivery pressure at the top of the shaft. The engine was thus placed near to where the water was to be delivered, rather than its source.|$|E
50|$|The first {{practical}} {{examples of}} these engines were installed in 1742 at Coalbrookdale and as improvements to the Carron Ironworks on the Clyde in 1765. Richard Ford at Coalbrookdale first tried using horse pumps in 1735. The first engines were atmospheric beam engines to either Newcomen, Smeaton or Watt's systems. A cylinder was provided {{on opposite sides of}} the beam, one as the working cylinder supplied with steam and the other as the pumping cylinder. The engines were single-acting, the power stroke being downwards at the power cylinder, and the pump being a simple upward-acting <b>bucket</b> <b>pump.</b> The Watt engines were of Watt's early single-acting atmospheric designs. By the time of his later thermodynamic improvements, he had also developed his sun and planet gear and could offer engines that rotated directly. A large single-acting engine, Resolution, was built at Coalbrookdale and by the time it was delivered in 1782, it had already been obsoleted by these further developments. Despite this, the engine worked successfully for almost forty years.|$|E
50|$|The Newtown Pumphouse raised {{water from}} the River Severn to the canal, {{initially}} using an undershot water wheel to operate two <b>bucket</b> <b>pumps.</b> This was supplemented by a steam engine for times when the waterwheel failed to provide sufficient power. In time this arrangement {{was replaced by a}} diesel powered pump.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{hand-operated}} community {{pumps are}} considered the most sustainable low-cost option for safe water supply in resource-poor settings, often in rural areas in developing countries. A hand pump opens access to deeper groundwater that is often not polluted and also improves {{the safety of a}} well by protecting the water source from contaminated <b>buckets.</b> <b>Pumps</b> such as the Afridev pump are designed to be cheap to build and install, and easy to maintain with simple parts. However, scarcity of spare parts for these type of pumps in some regions of Africa has diminished their utility for these areas.|$|R
50|$|When practical, a sump {{can also}} be drained using <b>buckets,</b> <b>pumps</b> or siphons. Pumping the water away {{requires}} the inward flow of water into the sump {{to be less than}} {{the rate at which the}} pump empties it, as well as a suitable place to collect the emptied water. Upstream sumps have been successfully emptied using hoses to siphon water out of them, such as at the Sinkhole Dersios during exploration in 2005. The water was sent deeper into the sinkhole and the emptied sumps revealed virgin passage behind them. During a rescue from beyond a downstream sump at Sarkhos Cave in 2002, water was pumped upstream into a dam constructed a few metres above the flooded passage.|$|R

5000|$|Methods of {{removing}} water from bilges have included <b>buckets</b> and <b>pumps.</b> Modern vessels usually use electric bilge pumps controlled by automated bilge switches.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{interior}} farming areas {{accounted for more}} than one-half of the country's cultivated land. Rainfall, although greater in the interior than along the coast, is insufficient for growing crops. Most of the water for irrigation is obtained through the falaj system, in which a vertical shaft is dug from the surface to reach water in porous rock. From the bottom of this shaft, a gently sloping tunnel is dug to tap the water and allow it to flow to a point on the surface at a lower level or into a cistern or underground pool from which it can be lifted by <b>bucket</b> or <b>pump.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the Second World War (1939-1945) Southampton {{was bombed}} heavily {{and there were}} direct hits on the parish and much loss of life.

5000|$|The streltsy of Moscow {{guarded the}} Kremlin, {{performed}} general guard duty, {{and participated in}} military operations.

Grigory Kotoshikhin, a Russian diplomat who had spied for and then defected to Sweden in the 1660s, reported that they used axes and <b>buckets</b> and copper <b>pumps</b> as well as hooks to pull down adjacent buildings so that fires would not spread, but Adam Olearius, a Westerner who travelled to Russia in the 17th century, noted that they never used water.|$|R
50|$|The Vigiles were {{accommodated}} in barracks and {{patrolled the}} streets, especially at night, {{on the lookout}} for any unsupervised fires. Every householder was obliged to keep equipment for fighting fires, and the men themselves were equipped with <b>pumps,</b> <b>buckets,</b> hooks (for pulling down burning material), picks, mattocks and axes. They also used ballistae for knocking down burning houses and creating firebreaks. They even had their own medical support (medici), with four doctors attached to each cohort, and their own chaplains (victimarii). A siphonarius operated a pump and an aquarius supervised the supply of water. The ordinary firefighters were called milites (soldiers).|$|R
50|$|One {{of the few}} {{successful}} early {{workings of}} the Upper Hirst also ended in a flood. The eastern outcrop was mined by Sir George Bruce, using methods technically advanced for the time, such as a horse-powered <b>bucket</b> and chain <b>pumping</b> system. But the finest achievement was the Moat Pit, a shaft (actually two concentric shafts, for ventilation) constructed in an artificial island in the River Forth, where ships could directly load coal from the mine. On one occasion the mine was visited by King James, who entered from the shore and emerged on the artificial island. But in a great storm on 30 March 1625, coinciding with high tide, the colliery was flooded. Sir George Bruce died later that year, and no {{attempt was made to}} rescue the colliery.|$|R
5000|$|Hinckley {{was known}} to its {{residents}} for many years as [...] "Tin 'At" [...] (tin hat). It is reputed that, many years ago, one of the itinerant sheep drovers bragged that he could drink a hat full of ale.

2500|$|At noon on 15 September 1890, Ertuğrul {{set sail}} from Yokohama for Constantinople. At {{the time of}} departure, the weather {{conditions}} were good, but the next morning a reverse wind began to blow, getting stronger towards evening. By nightfall, the wind came from below the bow so that the sails had to be folded. At the same time, violent waves began beating against the ship, which, under severe trial, could hardly make headway. The [...] high mizzen mast collapsed and caused severe damage by shaking {{from side to side}} and banging into the other (rigging) sails. While the storm continued gaining power, waves coming from the bow separated the deck boards from the front. Water broke through into the coal depots in the boiler room. Over the next four days, the crew tried to repair the damage by remedying the sails and tightening the shrouds. They also continuously tried to empty the water out of the coal containers (which were the ones most seriously in danger) using <b>buckets,</b> since the <b>pumps</b> were insufficient.|$|R

He began anywhere: you put some question to him, made some suggestive observation: instead of answering this, or decidedly setting out towards answer of it, he would accumulate formidable apparatus, logical swim-bladders, transcendental life-preservers and other precautionary and vehiculatory gear, for setting out; perhaps did at last get under way,--but was swiftly solicited, turned aside by the glance of some radiant new game on this hand or that, into new courses; and ever into new; and before long into all the Universe, where it was uncertain what game you would catch, or whether any.|$|R
60|$|Landed on {{the rock}} with the three boats {{belonging}} to the tender at five p.m., and began immediately to bale {{the water out of}} the foundation-pit with a number of <b>buckets,</b> while the <b>pumps</b> were also kept in action with relays of artificers and seamen. The work commenced upon the higher parts of the foundation as the water left them, but it was now pretty generally reduced to a level. About twenty men could be conveniently employed at each pump, and it is quite astonishing in how short a time so great a body of water could be drawn off. The water in the foundation-pit at this time measured about two feet in depth, on an area of forty-two feet in diameter, and yet it was drawn off in the course of about half an hour. After this the artificers commenced with their picks and continued at work for two hours and a half, some of the sailors being at the same time busily employed in clearing the foundation of chips and in conveying the irons to and from the smiths on the beacon, where they were sharped. At eight o'clock the sea broke in upon us and overflowed the foundation-pit, when the boats returned to the tender.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first ever}} Roman fire brigade {{of which we}} have any {{substantial}} history was created by Marcus Licinius Crassus. Marcus Licinius Crassus {{was born into a}} wealthy Roman family around the year 115 BC, and acquired an enormous fortune through (in the words of Plutarch) [...] "fire and rapine." [...] One of his most lucrative schemes took advantage of the fact that Rome had no fire department. Crassus filled this void by creating his own brigade—500 men strong—which rushed to burning buildings at the first cry of alarm. Upon arriving at the scene, however, the fire fighters did nothing while their employer bargained over the price of their services with the distressed property owner. If Crassus could not negotiate a satisfactory price, his men simply let the structure burn to the ground, after which he offered to purchase it for a fraction of its value. Emperor Nero took the basic idea from Crassus and then built on it to form the Vigiles in AD 60 to combat fires using <b>bucket</b> brigades and <b>pumps,</b> as well as poles, hooks and even ballistae to tear down buildings in advance of the flames. The Vigiles patrolled the streets of Rome to watch for fires and served as a police force. The later brigades consisted of hundreds of men, all ready for action. When there was a fire, the men would line up to the nearest water source and pass buckets hand in hand to the fire.|$|R
40|$|The vortex {{is created}} in a {{cylinder}} (5 -in diameter, 15 -in high) where water flows in tangentially {{near the bottom}} and flows out at the bottom center through a drain hole into a <b>bucket.</b> A submersible <b>pump</b> circulates the water. A PVC pipe is inserted in the vortex and its bottom end is positioned freely at the drain hole. This insertion breaks down the air-core vortex. As a result, more water drains out causing the water level to drop below the pipe's mid-point. The incoming flow then drags the pipe with it around the cylinder, while the pipe's bottom end remains at the drain hole. Eventually, the pipe is oriented vertically along the central axis due to radial pressure gradients (i. e., higher pressure near the cylinder wall, lower pressure near the central axis). As soon as the water level rises above the pipe, the air-core vortex is re-formed above and through the pipe. The water level keeps increasing to about 2 - 3 inches above the pipe. At this point, air-core instabilities become large enough to induce oscillations which throw the pipe's top end off center. This action destroys the air-core vortex which again increases the out flow rate, lowering the water level. Then, the above sequence is repeated; it continues {{as long as the}} incoming flow is maintained. We observed the phenomenon quite accidentally while experimenting with creation of water fountains with special effects. It appears the phenomenon has not been reported in the literature, and we would like to investigate it further. One possible application might be a source of whirling motion in kinetic sculptures. The video was presented in the APS-DFD Gallery of Fluid Motion in Salt Lake City, November 2007. This short video shows a curious cyclic phenomenon that occurs when a PVC pipe interacts with an air-core vortex, created in a cylinder with a tangential inflow and central outflow at the bottom...|$|R

6000|$|Another very {{important}} point in this connection {{is the question of}} the supply of teachers. I should say {{that is one of the}} greatest difficulties which beset the whole problem before us. I do not wish in the slightest degree to criticise the existing system of preparing teachers for ordinary school work. I have nothing to say about it. But what I do wish to say, and what I trust I may impress on your minds firmly is this, that for the purpose of obtaining persons competent to teach science or to act as technical teachers, a different system must be adopted. For this purpose a man must know what he is about thoroughly, and be able to deal with his subject as if it were the business of his ordinary life. For this purpose, for the obtaining of teachers of science and of technical classes, the system of catching a boy or girl young, making a pupil teacher of him, compelling the poor little mortal to pour from his little bucket, into a still smaller bucket, that which has just been poured into it out of a big bucket; and passing him afterwards through the training college, where his life is devoted to filling the <b>bucket</b> from the <b>pump</b> from morning till night, without time for thought or reflection, is a system which should not continue. Let me assure you that it will not do for us, that you had better give the attempt up than try that system. I remember somewhere reading of an interview between the poet Southey and a good Quaker. Southey was a man of marvellous powers of work. He had a habit of dividing his time into little parts each of which was filled up, and he told the Quaker what he did in this hour and that, and so on through the day until far into the night. The Quaker listened, and at the close said, [...] "Well, but, friend Southey, when dost thee think?" [...] The system which I am now adverting to is arraigned and condemned by putting that question to it. When does the unhappy pupil teacher, or over-drilled student of a training college, find any time to think? I am sure if I were in their place I could not. I repeat, that kind of thing will not do for science teachers. For science teachers must have knowledge, and knowledge is not to be acquired on these terms. The power of repetition is, but that is not knowledge. The knowledge which is absolutely requisite in dealing with young children is the knowledge you possess, as you would know your own business, and which you can just turn about as if you were explaining to a boy a matter of everyday life.|$|R

40|$|Water quality {{characteristics}} of the heavily urbanised and industrialised Swartkops River catchment in the Eastern Cape {{has been the focus}} of several studies since the 1970 s. Overloaded and poorly maintained wastewater treatment works (WWTW), polluted stormwater runoff and solid waste have had a negative impact on the water quality status of the Swartkops River and estuary. Past studies have revealed that a distinct relationship exists between land use activities and the water quality of the Swartkops Estuary, which in turn has raised concerns pertaining to the ecological, economic, recreational, and cultural value of the estuaryThe Swartkops Estuary has a Present Ecological State (PES) of Category D(1) and a Recommended Ecological Category (REC) (2) of a C (Van Niekerk et al., 2014). It is known that effective management of anthropogenic impacts on coastal systems requires a thorough understanding of the system’s biological responses to wastewater discharges and to hydrologic changes. For this reason, the objective of this study was to determine the current water quality status of the Swartkops Estuary, and to gain greater insight into factors controlling eutrophication. This was important as outdated water quality information was used in the Swartkops Integrated Environmental Management Plan (Enviro-Fish Africa, 2011) due to a lack of current data. To determine the current water quality status of the Swartkops Estuary the present study investigated spatial and temporal variability in physico-chemical parameters, nutrients, phytoplankton biomass and community composition, faecal bacteria, and “where possible” related this to historical water quality data. In general, points of entry into the estuary were investigated for their impact on nutrient enrichment and the bacteriological status of the estuary. Water quality surveys were completed in September 2012, November 2012, February 2013, May 2013 and August 2013 The present study found evidence to suggest that water is not flushed as efficiently from the estuary as was previously the case, and that the natural hydrology of the estuary has been modified. These changes appear to be the effect of large volumes of wastewater discharges from the wastewater treatment works (WWTW), which has led to the additional stresses of increased vertical stratification and reduced vertical mixing. A build-up of dissolved inorganic nutrients has given rise to persistent eutrophic conditions and phytoplankton blooms occurring from the middle reaches to the tidal limit of the estuary. These findings were associated with a generally well oxygenated estuary; however, bottom water hypoxic conditions were recorded in the upper reaches of the estuary on two occasions and were generally associated with bloom. forming flagellates. Elevated concentrations of inorganic nutrients stimulated phytoplankton to attain high biomass ranging from 0 to 248 g l- 1 (31. 8 6. 56 g l- 1). All nutrients displayed positive linear gradients from the mouth to the tidal limit, showed significant (p 10 000 cells ml- 1) of several different groups were recorded from the middle reaches of the estuary to the tidal limit. Diatoms were the dominant group during increased freshwater inflow (at mean daily flow rate of 2. 14 m 3 s- 1) and low DIP levels, whereas flagellates were generally the dominant group during reduced flow and under higher nutrient levels. Although the different tidal stages had no effect on phytoplankton biomass per se, it did support co-existance between phytoplankton groups. This was noted during the spring ebb tide in September 2012 (i. e. flagellates, diatoms and dinoflagellate) and in February 2013 (i. e. dinoflagellates, diatoms and chlorophytes). Phytoplankton blooms have become persistent in the middle to upper reaches of the estuary where chlorophyll-a was > 20 µg l- 1 and cell density exceeded 10 000 cells ml- 1; a situation not reported in previous studies. The Motherwell Canal was and still is the main source of nitrogen (generally in the form of ammonium) to the estuary, whereas the Swartkops River is still the primary source of phosphorus to the estuary. Since the stormwater canal services the large residential area of Motherwell where leaks in the sewer system, the dumping of night soil <b>buckets,</b> and faulty <b>pumps</b> are often reported, polluted discharges from the Motherwell Canal can enter the canal at any given point. In contrast to the canal, DIP loading from the Swartkops River to the estuary generally occurred under conditions of low flow, whereas nitrogen showed no apparent relationship. Faecal bacteria originating from the Motherwell Canal had the most profound effect on the bacteriological status in the middle reaches of the estuary, whereas the Swartkops River had an intermediate effect due to bacteria die-offs occurring between the point of release from the WWTW to the riverine reaches and the tidal limit of the estuary. Nevertheless, Escherichia coli and enterococci levels are still high, especially in the summer months rendering the estuary unsafe for recreation during this season. Historical data on trace metals in the water column were limited and thus observations from the present study could not be concluded with much confidence. However, preliminary data suggest that levels of copper, zinc, iron and cadmium have increased by at least 90 % in the estuary, at the tidal limit of the estuary and in the Markman and Motherwell canals. High inputs of nutrients, trace metals and faecal bacteria to the estuary from land-use activities indicate the necessity for remedial actions with the main objective being to conserve and protect the estuary’s recreational, ecological and economic functions...|$|R
