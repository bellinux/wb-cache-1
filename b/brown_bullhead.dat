5|$|In 1999, {{the only}} Class-A fishery {{waters in the}} Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} were those of Little Nescopeck Creek A, the headwaters of Nescopeck Creek, and several minor tributaries of Nescopeck Creek. Only one small stream near Nescopeck Creek's mouth had Class-C fishery waters. The central part of Nescopeck Creek, {{as well as most}} of Black Creek had Class-D fishery waters. There were twenty species of fish in Nescopeck Creek in 1999. Of these, seventeen had been seen in the watershed before. However, since between a 1999 study of the watershed and the study before that, the <b>brown</b> <b>bullhead</b> and the bluegill fish had vanished from the Nescopeck Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of Atlantic tomcod and rainbow smelt, tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lamprey, and striped bass and hundreds of Atlantic sturgeon. Other fish include the blueback herring, the <b>brown</b> <b>bullhead,</b> the chain pickerel, the smallmouth bass, the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoise, harbour seals, and porbeagles. Freshwater mollusc species included the brook floater, the dwarf wedgemussel, the eastern ellipto, the eastern floater, the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle floater. Many other aquatic organisms are thought to have once entered the watershed due to the low salinity of the water.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>bullheads</b> hold {{no special}} status on the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, the United States Endangered Species Program, {{or under the}} CITES appendix. [...] <b>Brown</b> <b>bullheads</b> can {{tolerate}} very low dissolved oxygen levels that result from industrial and domestic pollution, aiding in their overall high rate of survivorship. [...] <b>Brown</b> <b>bullheads</b> are the most abundant species in many lakes and streams continentally.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>Bullheads</b> are {{omnivorous}} benthic bottom feeders. Their diet {{consists of}} algae, mollusks, crustaceans, insects, crayfish and other smaller fish species. [...] <b>Brown</b> <b>bullheads</b> are typically nocturnal feeders, {{but have been}} reported to feed diurnally. Bullheads have poor eye sight and are heavily reliant on their sensitive barbels to locate their food. [...] Bullheads are omnivorous and will reportedly eat almost anything that fits in their mouth.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>bullheads</b> are {{the most}} {{susceptible}} to predators in their developmental stages (primarily as eggs) and include but are not exclusively prey to; northern pike, muskellunge, walleye, snapping turtles, water snakes, green herons, minnows, yellow perch, and sunfish. [...] Additionally, <b>brown</b> <b>bullheads</b> are also used for small scales commercial fishing, recreational fishing, and more specifically for consumption and research. Predation by other fish and coexisting species is only a realistic threat to bullheads under four inches, while {{the biggest threat to}} adult <b>bullheads</b> are humans. <b>Brown</b> <b>bullheads</b> have camouflage coloration to avoid predation. [...] As a mode of physical defense against predators, bullhead species have a sharp spine on the leading edge of their dorsal and pectoral fins. To use this adaptation as a defense mechanism, bullheads will stiffen the spine while being attacked impeding the predators ability to swallow while simultaneously releasing a poison to sting and burn the predator.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>Bullheads</b> {{typically}} live between six {{and eight}} years (but {{have been recorded}} as old as nine), and spawn between April and June. During the duration of each breeding season, females will be monogamous. The females lay eggs in dark shallow locations like under rocks and inside logs, and nests are primarily created by the females. The fertilization is external and the fish face opposite one another during the process. There are no consistent behaviors of mate attraction. The eggs are protected by both the males and the females who additionally will guard their offspring for a while following their hatching. [...] The eggs will hatch in 13 days but often closer to six days. Additionally, following the hatching the parents will generally care for their offspring for five days. [...] Adults, male and female, will reach sexual maturity around age three and in their lifetime can produce between 10 and 10,000 offspring. <b>Brown</b> <b>bullheads</b> have additionally been recorded eating their own eggs occasionally.|$|R
40|$|Catfish {{pectoral}} spines are an anti-predator defense mechanism. They can {{be bound}} or locked, making the fish harder to swallow, or {{used to produce}} distress calls by rubbing ridges on the dorsal process against a channel in {{the wall of the}} pectoral girdle. Growth of the pectoral spine and girdle were examined in relation to fish size within and across species that occur throughout central and eastern Virginia. These included blue catfish (Ictalurus furcatus), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), white catfish (Ameiurus catus), <b>brown</b> <b>bullheads</b> (Ameiurus nebulosus), yellow bullheads (Ameiurus natalis), flathead catfish (Pylodictis olivaris), margined madtom (Noturus insignis), and tadpole madtom (Noturus gyrinus). Pectoral spines and girdles grow as catfish increase in size. In larger species spine length and weight increase nonlinearly with fish size, suggesting that maintaining spine dimensions becomes less important in bigger individuals less likely to suffer predation. The incidence of spine breakage also increases in larger fish. In smaller species spine length increases linearly in our samples (<b>brown</b> and yellow <b>bullheads</b> and margined and tadpole madtoms). In all species spine width increases linearly with total length. The spine base (dorsal process width and depth and dorsal-ventral length) grows linearly with total length in most species. However, measurements of the spine base increase nonlinearly in white catfishes, and dorsal process width increases nonlinearly in wild channel catfish although the increase was linear in cultured channel catfish. Girdle depth increased linearly with total length in all species except for wild channel catfish, and the ratio of coracoid to cleithrum depth varied among species. Pectoral girdle weight increased linearly with fish weight in blue catfish, cultured channel catfish, <b>brown</b> <b>bullheads,</b> and margined and tadpole madtoms. However, girdle weight, a major component of the body, increased nonlinearly in wild channel, white, yellow bullheads, and flathead catfishes. Cultured channel catfish had smaller pectoral spines and girdles than wild channels, a likely epigenetic response to predators. Catfish spines were identified to species, allowing determination of catfishes eaten by bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) using spines collected near their nests. Bald eagles ate blue catfish (60 %), channel catfish (27 %), white catfish (9 %), <b>brown</b> <b>bullheads</b> (4 %) and yellow bullheads (0. 5 %). Madtom and flathead catfish were not consumed. Mean sizes captured were: Blue catfish (366 mm, 414 g), channel catfish (417 mm, 618 g), white catfish (320 mm, 591 g), <b>brown</b> <b>bullheads</b> (278 mm, 277 g) and yellow bullhead (203 mm, 192 g) ...|$|R
25|$|The refuge {{has five}} varied habitats: {{freshwater}} tidal marsh, impounded water, woods, meadow and field. The diversity of such habitats {{in such a}} concentrated area make it a natural magnet for all forms of wildlife. In addition to the above-mentioned there are {{a wide variety of}} fish species that can be found in both, Darby Creek, the lifeblood of Tinicum Marsh, as well as the 145 acre (0.6km2) impoundment and the smaller, Hoy's Pond. They include <b>brown</b> <b>bullhead,</b> channel catfish, crappie, carp and small striped bass that utilize the wider expanses of Darby Creek, just before its confluence with the Delaware River, in the earlier stages of their development. The fields and meadows provide open areas where wide arrays of insects including several species of butterflies can be found foraging the dozens of species of wildflowers.|$|E
25|$|Sleep in fish is not {{extensively}} studied. Typically fish exhibit {{periods of}} inactivity but show no significant reactions to deprivation of this condition. Some species that always live in shoals or that swim continuously (because {{of a need}} for ram ventilation of the gills, for example) are suspected never to sleep. There is also doubt about certain blind species that live in caves. Other fish seem to sleep, however. For example, zebrafish, tilapia, tench, <b>brown</b> <b>bullhead,</b> and swell shark become motionless and unresponsive at night (or by day, {{in the case of}} the swell shark); Spanish hogfish and blue-headed wrasse can even be lifted by hand all the way to the surface without evoking a response. A 1961 observational study of approximately 200 species in European public aquaria reported many cases of apparent sleep. On the other hand, sleep patterns are easily disrupted and may even disappear during periods of migration, spawning, and parental care.|$|E

500|$|The {{bald eagle}} is an {{opportunistic}} carnivore {{with the capacity}} to consume {{a great variety of}} prey. Throughout their range, fish often comprise the majority of the eagle's diet. In 20 food habit studies across the species' range, fish comprised 56% of the diet of nesting eagles, birds 28%, mammals 14% and other prey 2%. In Southeast Alaska, fish comprise approximately 66% of the year-around diet of bald eagles and 78% of the prey brought to the nest by the parents. Eagles living in the Columbia River Estuary in Oregon were found to rely on fish for 90% of their dietary intake. In the Pacific Northwest, spawning trout and salmon provide most of the bald eagles' diet from late summer throughout fall. Southeast Alaskan eagles largely prey on pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), coho salmon (O. kisutch) and, more locally, sockeye salmon (O. nerka), with chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), due to their large size ( [...] average adult size) probably being taken only as carrion. Also important in the estuaries and shallow coastlines of southern Alaska are Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus) and eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus).

40|$|Abstract- 1. Complete {{deoxygenation}} of {{arterial blood}} {{results in the}} failure of oxygen consumption in <b>brown</b> <b>bullheads</b> (Ictalurus nebulosus) at low levels of ambient oxygen. 2. The arterial deoxygenation apparently results from inability of the blood to load oxygen across the diffusion barrier of the gills, since gill ventilation and perfusion continue after oxygen uptake ceases. 3. The ambient oxygen tension at which this occurs differs appropriately in two groups of bullheads known to have different blood oxygen affinities {{as a result of}} thermal acclimation. The oxygen affinity of the blood is therefore strongly implicated as a factor limiting oxygen uptake at low levels of ambient oxygen...|$|R
