2500|$|On 6 May 1947, 16-year-old Alexander Rubowitz {{disappeared}} while {{putting up}} posters for Jewish paramilitary group Lehi. Palestine police CID {{believed he had}} been caught and killed by Farran's squad; Gurney ordered them [...] "to proceed with the case as an ordinary criminal offence with the object of bringing Farran and any other accused to trial". According to an account ruled inadmissible at Farran's trial, Rubowitz {{was taken to a}} remote location where, after brutal attempts to extract information, he was killed by Farran with a rock and the body given to an Arab for disposal. His body was never found. Suspicions of Farran's involvement were first raised after a grey trilby hat, <b>bearing</b> <b>worn</b> lettering compatible with his name, was found near the street corner where a struggling Rubowitz was seen being pushed into a car. Farran claimed he was being framed and fled to Syria. Colonel Bernard Fergusson persuaded Farran to return voluntarily. However, when, contrary to Fergusson's assurances, he was arrested, Farran escaped to Jordan, finally returning when he heard of reprisals being planned against British officers. He was brought to trial in a British military court in Jerusalem.|$|E
50|$|An {{electrostatic}} shielded {{induction motor}} (ESIM) is one {{approach to the}} shaft-voltage problem, as the insulation reduces voltage levels below the dielectric breakdown. This effectively stops bearing degradation and offers one solution to accelerated <b>bearing</b> <b>wear</b> caused by fluting, induced by pulsewidth modulated (PWM) inverters.|$|R
40|$|Most {{high speed}} {{cryogenic}} turbopumps for liquid propulsion rocket engines currently use ball or roller contact bearings for rotor support. The operating speeds, loads, clearances, and environments of these pumps combine to make <b>bearing</b> <b>wear</b> a limiting factor on turbopump life. An {{example is the}} high pressure oxygen turbopump (HPOTP) used in the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME). Although the HPOTP design life is 27, 000 seconds at 30, 000 rpms, or approximately 50 missions, bearings must currently be replaced after 2 missions. One solution to the <b>bearing</b> <b>wear</b> problem in the HPOTP, {{as well as in}} future turbopump designs, is the utilization of fluid film bearings in lieu of continuous contact bearings. Hydrostatic, hydrodynamic, and damping seal bearings are all replacement candidates for contact bearings in rocket engine high speed turbomachinery. These three types of fluid film bearings have different operating characteristics, but they share a common set of mechanical design opportunities and difficulties. Results of research to define some of the mechanical design issues are given. Problems considered include transient strat/stop rub, non-operational rotor support, <b>bearing</b> <b>wear</b> inspection and measurement, and bearing fluid supply route. Emphasis is given to the HPOTP preburner pump (PBP) bearing, but the results are pertinent to high-speed cryogenic turbomachinery in general...|$|R
40|$|The {{probabilistic}} design approach currently receiving {{attention for}} structural failure modes has been adapted for obtaining measured <b>bearing</b> <b>wear</b> limits in the Space Shuttle Main Engine high-pressure oxidizer turbopump. With {{the development of}} the shaft microtravel measurements to determine bearing health, an acceptance limit was neeed that protects against all known faiure modes yet is not overly conservative. This acceptance criteria limit has been successfully determined using probabilistic descriptions of preflight hardware geometry, empirical <b>bearing</b> <b>wear</b> data, mission requirements, and measurement tool precision as an input for a Monte Carlo simulation. The result of the simulation is a frequency distribution of failures as a function of preflight acceptance limits. When the distribution is converted into a reliability curve, a conscious risk management decision is made concerning the acceptance limit...|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} to analyze particulates extracted from inline jet engine oil filters using energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) is presented. This technique, {{developed by the}} U. S. Department of Defense’s Joint Oil Analysis Technical Support Center (JOAP-TSC), is termed filter debris analysis (FDA). Six beta prototype instruments capable of performing FDA-EDXRF in an automated mode were manufactured under a U. S. Air Force (USAF) Productivity Reliability Availability and Maintainability (PRAM) project. J 52 P 408 (J 52) engines were suffering from {{what appeared to be}} sudden, catastrophic failures resulting in the loss of aircraft. The root cause of the failure was a lack of lubrication in the 4 bearing area that caused the 4 bearing cage to fracture. The analysis of oil samples by rotrode emission spectroscopy did not indicate a catastrophic bearing failure mode was evolving. FDA-EDXRF was one of the techniques employed to try to discover the onset of 4 bearing failure. An FDA-EDXRF profile of the J 52 engine was developed in about 3 weeks. Initially, particulates obtained from J 52 filters where FDA indicated that abnormal amounts of <b>bearing</b> <b>wear</b> were present in the engine were sent to Pratt & Whitney Aerospace Laboratory to be analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM results confirmed the presence of M- 50 alloy or <b>bearing</b> <b>wear.</b> Subsequent teardowns of a portion of the engines having abnormal <b>bearing</b> <b>wear</b> indicated by FDA had fractured 4 bearing cages.

Contrary to linear recurrence equations with constant coefficients, linear recurrence equations with variable coefficients rarely have analytical solutions [...] Numerical solutions of such equations are always practicable. In numerous analytical methods of solutions of linear recurrence equations with variable coefficients there are usually three research directions.

40|$|Analysis {{of known}} studies {{has shown that}} {{existing}} approaches required solution of complex systems of integral-differential equations or cumbersome numerical methods that are unacceptable in the engineering practice. As a result, {{a model of the}} sliding <b>bearing</b> <b>wear</b> in conditions of boundary friction was obtained in a form of dependence of the wear rate on the dimensionless complexes of contact pressure and sliding velocity. On the basis of the proposed wear model, the wear-contact problem for a cylindrical sliding bearing was solved. The equation of equilibrium for medium pressures and the approximating function of linear wear from the arc of contact between the shaft and the bushing were used as the determining equations. The solution was obtained in a closed form as a dependence of wear degree on the friction path. To identify parameters of wear resistance in the wear model, a calculation-experimental method for determining calculated dependences of wear resistance parameters was developed {{on the basis of the}} wear test by the "cone - three balls" scheme. It has shown that the calculated wear values were consistent with the operational data on <b>wear</b> of sliding <b>bearings.</b> Influence of determining factors of sliding velocity and load on <b>bearing</b> <b>wear</b> was studied.

25|$|Rod {{sticking}} {{has been}} attributed to misalignment, corrosion product build-up, <b>bearing</b> <b>wear,</b> clutch wear, and drive mechanism seal wear. Many of the failure modes that caused a stuck rod during tests (like <b>bearing</b> and clutch <b>wear)</b> would only apply to a movement performed by the control rod drive mechanism. Since the No. 9 rod is centrally located, its alignment may have been better than Nos. 1, 3, 5, and 7 which were more prone to sticking. After the accident, logbooks and former plant operators were consulted to determine if there had been any rods stuck during the reassembly operation that Byrnes was performing. One person had performed this about 300 times, and another 250 times; neither had ever felt a control rod stick when being manually raised during this procedure. Furthermore, no one had ever reported a stuck rod during manual reconnection.|$|R
