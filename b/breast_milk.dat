In spite of its generally recognized importance, rates of <b>breast</b> <b>milking</b> alone are still low in mostcountries, and its lasting is unsatisfactory. This study aimed to evaluate the nutritional condition of 5 - 9 years oldchildren in correlation with the variables duration of <b>breast</b> <b>milking</b> alone, family income, mother’s literacy andnumber of family members. The study was performed with children dwelling in nine rural communities fromDiamantina-MG, Brazil. In order to evaluate the nutritional condition, it was utilized anthropometric measures ofweight and height. Indexers were constructed and cut-off values were established in accordance to the curves of theNational Center for Health Statistic - NCHS. The variables were obtained by means of a questionnaire developed bythe authors. A number of 149 children were randomly choosen (n value for a significance of 0. 05 and test power of 0. 9). Results showed that 76. 87 % of the children presented normal nutritional conditions, while 19. 73 % were innutritional risk since they were underweight and presented evidences of malnutrition, whereas 3. 4 % wereoverweight. Data indicated that the nutrition risk were predominant for children who were not exclusively breastmilkeduntil the 6 th month. It was also observed that the nutritional condition is influenced by the number of familymembers and by mother’s literacy. Therefore, rural populations, mainly composed by low-income families withimpaired healthy assistance, are being exposed to nutritional risk, whereas some reverting intervention is required...|$|R

40|$|Like {{other forms}} of infant feeding, {{breastfeeding}} is a fundamental act of care. Yet despite being the recommended way of feeding babies, breastfeeding {{is not always easy}} to do. In addition to lack of support, bio-physical problems and the need to return to work; discomfort with breastfeeding in public is a factor shaping infant feeding choice (and the decision to stop breastfeeding specifically). With increased awareness of <b>breast</b> <b>milk’s</b> health benefits in recent years, there has been a rise in efforts to make breastfeeding in public more commonplace and socially acceptable (including through lactation advocacy or ‘‘lactivism’’). This paper considers breastfeeding in public and lactation advocacy in the UK through interviews with lactation activists, non-activist breastfeeding mothers, and participantobservation at two breastfeeding picnics held in 2009.

Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), which are sparingly water-soluble owing to their acidic functional groups, are noted persistent organic pollutants; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are most often researched. PFAAs have been found in trace quantities worldwide from polar bears to humans, with PFOS and PFOA known to reside in <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> and the blood of newborn babies. A 2013 review showed a slight correlation between groundwater and soil PFAA levels and human activity; there was no clear pattern of one chemical dominating, and higher amounts of PFOS were correlated to higher amounts of PFOA. In the body, PFAAs bind to proteins such as serum albumin; they tend to concentrate within humans in the liver and blood before excretion through the kidneys. Dwell time in the body varies greatly by species, with half-lives of days in rodents, and years in humans. High doses of PFOS and PFOA cause cancer and death in newborn rodents but human studies have not established an effect at current exposure levels.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi {{reproductive}} {{policies were}} {{a significant factor}} behind their anti-tobacco campaign.

This opinion was also supported by well-known female racial hygienist Agnes Bluhm, whose book published in 1936 expressed the same view. The Nazi leadership was concerned over this because they wanted German women to be as reproductive as possible. An article published in a German gynecology journal in 1943 stated that women smoking three or more cigarettes per day were more likely to remain childless compared to nonsmoking women.|$|E

Furthermore, discouraging premastication as prevention to disease transmittion may prove as disastrous an infant public health policy as when infants breastfeeding was discouraged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the end, the potential benefits and pitfalls of this practice greatly depend on the dietary and medical circumstances of the mother and child.
