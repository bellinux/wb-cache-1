40|$|AbstractReiter's Default Logic {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular formalisms for {{describing}} default reasoning. One important defect of Default Logic is, however, the inability to reason <b>by</b> <b>cases.</b> Over the years, several solutions for this problem have been proposed. All these proposals deal with deriving new propositions through reasoning <b>by</b> <b>cases.</b> None, however, discuss the propositions that should no longer be derivable as a result of reasoning <b>by</b> <b>cases.</b> This paper discusses the latter subject. It shows that an intuitively plausible way of dealing with propositions that should no longer be derivable as a result of reasoning <b>by</b> <b>cases,</b> can have far reaching consequences. One of the consequences is that disjunctions must be viewed as describing possible extensions...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT (1) Reasoning <b>by</b> <b>cases,</b> {{a natural}} feature of human reasoning, has been {{difficult}} to formulate {{so that it can be}} performed naturally when needed. Several difficulties arise: (1) how to motivate the use of reasoning <b>by</b> <b>cases</b> when and only when needed, (2) how to determine an appropriate analysis of the goal into cases, and (3) how to carry out the deduction in each case and combine the results. In this paper we focus on how reasoning <b>by</b> <b>cases</b> can be naturally accomplished in the framework of derived antecedents (Smith 1982). Our main technical contributions are (1) a set of strategies that draw on the context of a deduction to provide an appropriate case analysis for a goal, and (2) inference rules for carrying out reasoning <b>by</b> <b>cases</b> and forming conditional terms for the existentially quantified variables in the initial goal. ...|$|R

The following July, Case joined Fox Film, Hollywood's third largest studio, to found the Fox-Case Corporation. The system developed <b>by</b> <b>Case</b> and his assistant, Earl Sponable, given the name Movietone, thus {{became the first}} viable sound-on-film technology controlled by a Hollywood movie studio. The following year, Fox purchased the North American rights to the Tri-Ergon system, though the company found it inferior to Movietone and virtually impossible to integrate the two different systems to advantage. In 1927, as well, Fox retained the services of Freeman Owens, who had particular expertise in constructing cameras for synch-sound film.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (now the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) {{had made}} several {{attempts}} {{to create a}} framework for protecting international investments, but its efforts revealed conflicting views on how to provide compensation for the expropriation of foreign direct investment. In 1961, then-General Counsel of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) Aron Broches developed {{the idea for a}} multilateral agreement on a process for resolving individual investment disputes on a case <b>by</b> <b>case</b> basis as opposed to imposing outcomes based on standards. Broches held conferences to consult legal experts {{from all parts of the}} world, including Europe, Africa, and Asia, to discuss and compose a preliminary agreement. The IBRD staff wrote an official draft of the agreement and consulted with legal representatives of the IBRD's board of directors to finalize the draft and have it approved. The board of directors approved the final draft of the agreement, titled Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, and the Bank president disseminated the convention to its member states for signature on 18 March 1965. Twenty states immediately ratified the convention. The convention establishing the ICSID entered into force on 14 October 1966.|$|E

5|$|UA 8699 was {{discovered}} in a joint study by Stony Brook University and the University of Antananarivo (UA) {{and placed in the}} collections of the latter as specimen 8699. It was found at a locality named MAD93-95 in the Anembalemba Member of the Maevarano Formation, which is Maastrichtian (latest Cretaceous) in age. The locality is in the Mahajanga Basin of northwestern Madagascar. Several other mammals have been recovered from similarly aged Madagascar deposits, but most are also known from very limited material. These include the gondwanathere Lavanify, an indeterminate multituberculate, and a few other indeterminate teeth, as well as a nearly complete skeleton representing an otherwise unknown mammalian lineage. In a 2001 Nature paper, David Krause announced the discovery of UA 8699 and argued for marsupial affinities of the specimen. Because the specimen is so fragmentary, he refrained from assigning a new scientific name to the tooth. Two years later, Alexander Averianov, David Archibald, and Thomas Martin favored a placental interpretation in a paper in Acta Palaeontologica Polonica, noting that the specimen was essentially similar to the zhelestid Lainodon. In a 2006 review of some of the Cretaceous vertebrates of Madagascar, Krause and colleagues continued to consider the specimen as a marsupial and announced that an upcoming paper <b>by</b> <b>Case</b> would make the case for marsupial affinities more fully.|$|E
