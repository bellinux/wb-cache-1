I was really nervous, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> singing 'Beside an Open Fireplace,' a popular song of the day. It was a sentimental tune and the lyrics choked me up. When I got done, the tears were streaming down my cheeks and the ballroom became quiet. I was very nearsighted and couldn't see the audience. I thought that the people didn't like me.|$|E

Distributed archiving of Usenet posts was suggested in November 1982 by Scott Orshan, who proposed that [...] "Every site should keep all the articles it posted, forever." [...] Also in November of that year, Rick Adams responded to a post asking [...] "Has anyone archived netnews, or does anyone plan to?"

2500|$|Many {{believed}} {{that although he}} played right-handed as an adult, Hogan was actually left-handed. In his book [...] "Five Lessons," [...] in the chapter entitled [...] "The Grip," [...] Hogan said [...] "I was born left-handed -- that was the normal {{way for me to}} do things. I was switched over to doing things right-handed when I was a boy <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> golf as a left-hander because the first club I ever came into possession of, an old five-iron, was a left-handed stick." [...] This belief also seemed to be corroborated by Hogan himself in his earlier book [...] "Power Golf." [...] However, some mystery still remains about this since Hogan in subsequent interviews said that the belief of him being left-handed was actually a myth (noted in what was probably his last video interview and in his 1987 Golf Magazine interview).|$|E
2500|$|Owen said he grew {{up around}} [...] "a mob of entertaining, troublesome, fascinating" [...] actors {{involved}} in challenging the Lord Chamberlain during {{some of the most}} exciting days of a very controversial Royal Court Theatre.

[...] "I was always made to read plays at school but I never wanted to. Then I was made to take part in a school play and I didn't want to do that either <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> to get approval for my acting.

When {{she gave me the}} news, I was upset, I started crying. I actually thought that while I was contemplating, 'What if I'm the killer?,' that I'd be excited <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> crying and started feeling bad for Terry. 'Oh man, this is a really tragic situation.'" [...] Allman also {{spoke about the}} point in the season when she began to wonder if Terry was the killer: [...] "I'm sure everybody on the cast was wondering if they were the killer or not at some point. But there was a scene that I alluded to some things that I had questioned whether or not I was the killer. It was the scene where [...] were playing with the trunk. I come down from the apartment and I see them in the garage locked in the trunk and I got really upset at Tommy. I remember [...] really wanting me to really shake Tommy and be very upset about this. I thought, why would I be that mad at him? It could've been, this is Terry not wanting the boys to mess around because it was how Rosie died or this is a flashback for her because she was involved." [...] This scene was in the Ogi Jun episode.|$|E

My breath stopped and I couldn't speak, and then he went on to ask if he might lend us twenty-five dollars. He got very red in the face when he said it and he began counting out the money on the sofa, and somehow I hadn't expected that it was money and began to cry.

Mr. Peters came over to my chair and took hold of the arm of it and told me not to cry. Somehow his touch on the arm of the chair thrilled all through me and though I knew that it was wrong I let him keep it there and even let him stroke the upholstery and I don't know just what would have happened but at that very minute Uncle William came in. He was most courteous to Mr. Peters and expressed his apologies for having been out and said that it must have been extremely depressing for Mr. Peters to find that he was not at home, and he thanked him for putting himself to the inconvenience of waiting.
