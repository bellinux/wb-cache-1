50|$|Internal {{compression}} {{refers to}} the compression of air within the supercharger itself, which, already at or close to boost level, can be delivered smoothly to the engine {{with little or no}} <b>back</b> <b>flow.</b> This is more effective than <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> compression and allows higher efficiency to be achieved. Internal compression devices usually use a fixed internal compression ratio. When the boost pressure is equal to the compression pressure of the supercharger, the <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> is zero. If the boost pressure exceeds that compression pressure, <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> can still occur as in a roots blower.

In this paper, six switching modes and their complements with opposite power transfer direction are defined with their operational constraints. Exact expressions for power transferred are derived with no fundamental frequency assumptions and range of power transfer for each mode is also defined to characterize mode limitations. Detailed constraints for zero voltage switching (ZVS) are also obtained. A new definition for converter reactive power consumption is introduced. This is based on calculation of inductor apparent power which avoids fundamental frequency approximations as well as the vague negative (<b>back</b> <b>flowing)</b> power definitions in recent papers. All known DAB phase shift modulation techniques including conventional, dual and extended phase shift, represent special cases from triple phase shift, therefore the presented analysis provides a generalised theory for all phase shift based modulation techniques...|$|E

Comparative studies between roller pumps with non-occlusive adjustments and centrifugal pumps {{have been made in}} recent decades in an attempt to develop new products and adjustments that cause fewer traumas to the figurative elements of blood. Usually the roller pumps are adjusted by the static method due to concern variables flow that can occur with non-occlusive settings. Excessive slack in the rollers provokes <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> and can provides errors in the calculation of flow by the rotation of the pump, according to the devices added to the circuit and the systemic resistance of the patient. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> caused by two types of roller pumps in blood aspirator and cardiotomy reservoir. Methods: <b>Back</b> <b>flow</b> visualization was performed in blood aspirator and cardiotomy reservoir. There were tested two different models of roller pumps, adjusted by drop rate and dynamic calibration. The tests were conducted with silicone tubes of 3 / 8 x 1 / 16 e 1 / 2 x 3 / 32 inches in diameter in water and solution similar to blood.

40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF Justin W. Behrens, for the Master of Science {{degree in}} Mechanical Engineering, {{presented}} on June 24, 2011 at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: MODIFICATION AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF A MONO-VALVE ENGINE MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Suri Rajan A four-stroke engine utilizing one tappet valve {{for both the}} intake and exhaust gas exchange processes has been built and evaluated. The engine operates under its own power, but has a reduced power capacity than the conventional 2 -valve engine. The reduction in power is traced to higher than expected amounts of exhaust gases <b>flowing</b> <b>back</b> into the intake system. Design changes to the cylinder head will fix the <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> problems, but the future capacity of mono-valve engine technology cannot be estimated. The <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> of exhaust gases increases the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate and deteriorates combustion. Intake pressure data shows the mono-valve engine requires an advanced intake valve closing (IVC) time to prevent <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> of charge air. A single actuation camshaft with advanced IVC was tested in the mono-valve engine, and was found to improve exhaust scavenging at TDC and nearly eliminated all charge air <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> at IVC. The optimum IVC timing is shown to be approximately 30 crank angle degrees after BDC. The mono-valve cylinder head utilizes a rotary valve positioned above the tappet valve. The open spaces inside the rotary valve and between the rotary valve and tappet valve represent a common volume {{that needs to be}} reduced {{in order to reduce the}} base EGR rate. Multiple rotary valve configurations were tested, and the size of the common volume was found to have no effect on <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> but a direct effect on the EGR rate and engine performance. The position of the rotary valve with respect to crank angle has a direct effect on the scavenging process. Optimum scavenging occurs when the intake port is opened just after TDC...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} tests were {{conducted}} to measure the mass flux in the far field of a nozzle plume in a high vacuum with emphasis on the <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> region. The measurements presented in this report provide fairly accurate data for off-axis angles as large as 140 deg (i. e., the <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> region). The tests utilized five different nozzles. Parameters such as expansion ratio, throat diameter, nozzle lip shape, and plenum (chamber) pressure were varied. Carbon dioxide and nitrogen gases were passed through, and mass flux measurements were taken using quartz crystal microbalances {{in as many as}} nine different locations relative to the test nozzle. The tests resulted in a large matrix of data that were correlated and compared to existing prediction theories. Several conclusions with respect to the effect of nozzle and gas parameters on the amount of <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> mass flux are offered, and it was demonstrated that gaseous mass fluxes, which are not predictable by present theories, are encountered in the region behind the nozzle exit plane...|$|R

30|$|Duplexing: Duplexing is an {{important}} consideration in multi-hop relay networks.
