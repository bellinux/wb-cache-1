50|$|The former Crawford and Co Building {{possesses}} a facade design that, in its individual elements and their composition, is uncommon {{and has always}} been uncommon.

25|$|The Palm House (1844–1848) was {{the result}} of {{cooperation}} between architect Decimus Burton and iron founder Richard Turner, and continues upon the glass house design principles developed by John Claudius Loudon and Joseph Paxton.

The 19m high central nave is surrounded by a walkway at 9m height, allowing visitors a closer look upon the palm tree crowns. In front of the Palm House on the east side are the Queen's Beasts, ten statues of animals <b>bearing</b> <b>shields.</b> They are Portland stone replicas of originals done by James Woodford and were placed here in 1958.|$|R
