25|$|Of those 25 years, I {{spent nine}} as {{prisoner}} of war. Those days were grim, and survival was a struggle. I {{was able to}} withstand that long agony <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> lost my determination to live—no matter how painful that became—because I love my country and never lost faith in her, and because I had dreams of what {{my life would be}} like upon my return to America. Those dreams were always, unquestionably, of a life that was Army. I found that the dream of continued service gave me a goal that helped me survive my years as a POW.|$|E

When you hear that song — the whole bounce of the record and the way she's flipping it and the stuff she talking about ... I knew that record was gonna go just because you never heard Mariah talk about this stuff. ... She's like, 'I packed up my Louis Vuitton.' She took it really on the ghetto side.

They said, 'Okay, John, you’ll do a scene naked.' I said 'Okay.' And {{so that was}} a big surprise. So I do this scene, this strange scene with Anna Torv, without any clothes on. Anna’s staying at the Bishop house with Walter running around with no clothes on except for a pair of slippers, getting breakfast. She comes round the corner and catches him in the full monty, going, 'Oh no!' Didn’t know where to look. That {{was probably one of the}} most fun things we ever did. Anna’s reaction was priceless to that. I haven’t seen the scene yet, but it was hilarious to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Solti {{described}} {{his father as}} [...] "a kind, sweet man who trusted everyone. He shouldn't have, but he did. Jews in Hungary were tremendously patriotic. In 1914, when war broke out, my father invested most of his money in a war loan to help the country. By the time the bonds matured, they were worthless." [...] Mor Stern was a religious man, but his son was less so. Late in life Solti recalled, [...] "I often upset him <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> stayed in the synagogue for longer than ten minutes." [...] Teréz Stern was from a musical family, and encouraged her daughter Lilly, eight years the elder of the children, to sing, and György to accompany her at the piano. Solti remembered, [...] "I made so many mistakes, but it was invaluable experience for an opera conductor. I learnt to swim with her." [...] He was not a diligent student of the piano: [...] "My mother kept telling me to practise, but what ten-year-old wants {{to play the piano}} when he could be out playing football?" ...|$|E
500|$|To protect Wollstonecraft, Imlay {{registered}} her as {{his wife}} in 1793, {{even though they were}} not married. After declaring war on Britain, France was blockaded by the Royal Navy, which caused shortages that worsened the problem of inflation. Imlay engaged in blockade-running, chartering ships to be bring in food and soap from America into France, which explained why both he and Wollstonecraft were not arrested during the Reign of Terror. As the Terror began in France with arrests and executions occurring daily, Wollstonecraft came under suspicion as someone from a nation that was at war with France and who was known to be a friend of leading Girondins, which led Imlay to make a false statement to the U.S. embassy in Paris that he had married her, automatically making her into an American citizen, in order to protect her from arrest. Some of her friends were not so lucky; many, like Thomas Paine, were arrested, and some were even guillotined (Wollstonecraft's sisters believed she had been imprisoned). Wollstonecraft called life under the Jacobins [...] "nightmarish" [...] with gigantic parades in the day where everyone had to cheer, lest they fall under suspicion of not being committed to the republic, and police raids at night to arrest [...] "enemies of the republic". In a letter to her sister Everina, written in March 1794, Wollstonecraft wrote: [...] "It is impossible for you to have any idea of the impression the sad scenes I have been a witness to have left on my mind...death and misery, in every shape of terror, haunted this devoted country – I certainly am glad that I came to France, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> could have had else a just opinion of the most extraordinary event that has ever been recorded." ...|$|E

After learning this, Vedel withdrew some distance along the highway. Spanish commanders threatened to massacre the French soldiers if this formation did not surrender, and Dupont compelled Vedel to return and lay down his arms. Handing his sword to Castaños, Dupont exclaimed, [...] "You may well, General, be proud of this day; it is remarkable <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have <b>never</b> lost a pitched battle until now—I who have been in more than twenty."

500|$|When {{asked what}} advice {{he would give}} to his character, Barber said [...] "Unfortunately, I don't think he would listen {{to me in the}} first place, but if he could give me the time of day, I would say lighten up on the control because you’re never going to have it." [...] Speaking to Channel 5, Barber {{revealed}} Rhys would not do a lot to redeem himself in the new year, but viewers would get learn more about his back story, which could explain his dark side. During a 2012 interview with Kilkelly, Barber said his character is good at getting what he wants, saying [...] "I {{think at the end of}} the day, he just wants to win and he has this ability to justify why he does things, and if people are hurt in the process, it's their fault. His vision is the one that is most important." [...] Barber said that deep down, Rhys is sensitive and he means well. When asked about the reaction Rhys has received from viewers, Barber believed they liked the character as he is unpredictable and manipulative. He added that the viewers are interested in seeing what Rhys does next. When asked how he felt about playing a bad boy by DNA's Matthew Myers, Barber revealed that he loved it, saying [...] "It's always exciting getting the scripts <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> know which way they are going to turn or who I'm going to be turning on!" [...] The actor quipped that he is always wondering which character he is going to manipulate or [...] "screw over" [...] next and added [...] "But at the core of things Rhys has a heart of gold." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the game, many sports writers {{commented on}} Warner's rise from an unknown backup to a Super Bowl MVP, but Warner himself wasn't {{impressed}} by it.

[...] "People think this season {{is the first time}} I touched a football; they don't realize I've been doing this for years – just not on this level, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> got the chance.

2500|$|In a June 2016 interview, Kiedis {{opened up}} {{about his past}} {{relationships}} saying that there were years when he had over 100 sexual partners and stated “If I saw a pretty girl, I wanted to have her.” When asked about marriage and growing old and alone Kiedis responded by saying “Maybe it is <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> learned {{to live in a}} relationship and as silly one sounds, I do not understand women yet. They remain a mystery. I talked about this yesterday with a friend: do we focus on finding a person who fits with us, or will we remain single? I am open to both. If the right one comes – wonderful.

2500|$|Although {{originally}} {{scheduled for}} release in 1989 (a novelization, written by science fiction author Robert Thurston, was published that year,) the film's theatrical run was initially delayed until April 1990 due to Empire International Pictures' bankruptcy during production. After more delays, Triumph Films released the film to theaters on November 21, 1990. When it peaked in its second weekend at the 13th spot, it grossed $464,441 in 333 theaters, averaging $1,394 per theater; it eventually earned a domestic total gross of $1,272,977. Its limited run in theaters prompted science fiction writer Gardner Dozois to remark that [...] "Robot Jox, a movie with a screenplay by Joe Haldeman, was supposedly released this year, but if it played through Philadelphia at all, it must have done so fast, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> even saw a listing for it, let alone the movie itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ellison was {{recalled}} to the squad, but {{omitted from}} the XI for the fourth Test at Old Trafford, [...] "fortunately", in his opinion: [...] "I say [...] fortunately <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> liked bowling at Old Trafford; {{it was more of}} a [...] spinner's wicket." [...] Only 24 wickets fell in the match, and both Jonathan Agnew and Paul Allott, rivals for a fast-bowling place, went wicketless. In the event, both Agnew and Allot were {{omitted from the}} next XI and Ellison was recalled for the fifth test. He remembers: [...] "When we got to Edgbaston I was advised not to play by Bernard Thomas (England physio) as I had a heavy cold. He thought I would not get through five days. The decision was left to me and I thought, as I had come this far, then why not." ...|$|E

His character becomes a guinea pig in the trials of a new mind-altering drug. Tompkinson performed his own stunts.

2500|$|After the Chili Peppers {{announced}} a long hiatus due to exhaustion, Flea enrolled in music {{classes at the}} University of Southern California. Beginning {{in the fall of}} 2008, he studied music theory, composition and jazz trumpet. Flea attributed his interest in attending such courses to a newfound desire to widen his appreciation and understanding of music: [...] "it's so much fun to learn this stuff <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> knew anything. I played trumpet in the school bands. I learned things I liked to play on my trumpet but I didn't learn why this note goes with this note and why it produces that sound. Or how to create tension in the composition [...] Knowing the structure is really fun." [...] Flea also revealed plans to release a mainly instrumental solo record, recorded in his home; guest musicians include Patti Smith and a choir from the Silverlake Conservatory.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the five}} songs she had written by for her seventh studio album, Clarkson co-wrote [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] with {{frequent}} collaborator Greg Kurstin, who produced the track. Clarkson has said about writing the song: A lot {{of the reasons why}} I wrote [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] was I guess I didn't realize the gravity of the situation until I had a child of my own, and until I experienced love like I do with Brandon (Blackstock) on the daily basis. I guess you don't realize something is missing until you feel it. I can't imagine walking away from my little girl. I can't imagine not having that love anymore. I didn't know it was missing <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> had it. It was a revelation and that's why I wrote that song. I {{think a lot of people}} go through that.|$|E

I’m not all about myself just because I know if it wasn’t for God, I wouldn’t be able {{to go out there and}} compete anyway. So I never look at it as a selfish thing—I never want all the attention or want it to be about me, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> want to get in to a situation where God has to humble me. I know for a fact that I am not doing it by myself; it is because of Him that I can compete over and over again. That’s basically how I grew up.

2500|$|After McQueary was {{identified}} as the graduate assistant who reported the 2002 incident, he was criticized for not intervening to protect the boy from Sandusky (an accusation McQueary has since disputed), {{as well as for}} not reporting the incident to police himself. On November 7, Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said that though some may have fulfilled their legal obligation to report suspected abuse, [...] "somebody has to question about what I would consider the moral requirements for a human being that knows of sexual things that are taking place with a child." [...] Noonan added that anyone who knows about suspected abuse, [...] "whether you're a football coach or a university president or the guy sweeping the building," [...] has [...] "a moral responsibility to call us." [...] Paterno said McQueary informed him that [...] "he had witnessed an incident in the shower ... but he at no time related to me the very specific actions contained in the Grand Jury report." [...] Paterno was uncertain if being more graphic would have made a difference. [...] "And to be frank with you I don't know that it would have done any good, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> heard of, of, rape and a man," [...] said Paterno.|$|E
2500|$|Armstrong's first guitar was a Cherry Red Hohner acoustic, {{which his}} father bought for him. He {{received}} his first electric guitar, a Fernandes Stratocaster that he named [...] "Blue," [...] {{when he was}} ten year old. His mother got [...] "Blue" [...] from George Cole who taught Armstrong electric guitar for 10 years. Armstrong says in a 1995 MTV interview, [...] "Basically, it wasn't like guitar lessons <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> really learned how to read music. So he just {{taught me how to}} put my hands on the thing." [...] Cole bought the guitar new from David Margen of the band Santana. Cole gave Armstrong a Bill Lawrence L500XL Humbucker pickup and told him to install the pickup in the bridge position. Armstrong switched the L500XL with a white Seymour Duncan SH-4 JB Humbucker at Woodstock '94. After the Seymour Duncan was filled with mud and ruined in November 1994, Armstrong reinstalled the original Bill Lawrence pickup before recording Insomniac in 1995, and used {{it for a long time}} after that, although he has since switched to a black Seymour Duncan SH-4 JB. [...] "Armstrong fetishized his teacher's guitar, partly because the blue instrument had a sound quality and Van Halen-worthy fluidity he couldn't get from his little red Hohner. He prized it mostly, however, because of his relationship with Cole, another father figure after the death of Andy." [...] He toured with this guitar from the band's early days and still uses it to this day, Both middle and neck pickups are disconnected and the pickup selector locked in the bridge position. [...] "Blue" [...] also appears in a number of Green Day music videos such as [...] "Longview", [...] "Basket Case", [...] "Geek Stink Breath", [...] "Stuck with Me", [...] "Brain Stew/Jaded", [...] "Hitchin' a Ride", and most recently in [...] "Minority".|$|E
