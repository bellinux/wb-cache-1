5|$|Hooke was {{prepared}} to accept {{the possibility that some}} such fossils represented species that had <b>become</b> <b>extinct,</b> possibly in past geological catastrophes.|$|E
5|$|Wagiman is {{expected}} to <b>become</b> <b>extinct</b> within {{the first half of}} the century, as the youngest generation of Wagiman people speak no Wagiman at all, and understand very little.|$|E
5|$|In a 2017 paper, Gwee {{and colleagues}} found that boobook populations on larger mountainous islands were more {{distinct}} from Australian stock, while those on flatter smaller islands {{were much more}} similar, suggesting that these locations were colonised much more recently after previous populations had <b>become</b> <b>extinct.</b>|$|E
5|$|The last {{surviving}} raphine species, the Rodrigues solitaire, probably <b>became</b> <b>extinct</b> before 1778. The dodo survived until 1662 or 1690. The Rodrigues solitaire <b>became</b> <b>extinct</b> {{because of}} the introduction of feral cats and heavy hunting by the human population. Although the dodo <b>became</b> <b>extinct</b> earlier, the causes of extinction are related and involve the introduction of animals and hunting.|$|R
50|$|Coccolithophorids and {{molluscs}} (including ammonites) <b>became</b> <b>extinct</b> or suffered great losses. For example, it {{is thought}} that ammonites were the principal food of mosasaurs, a group of giant marine reptiles that <b>became</b> <b>extinct</b> at the boundary.|$|R
50|$|The Permian {{ended with}} the most {{destructive}} mass extinction in all of earths history. Globally up to 96% of all species may have disappeared. Rugose and tabulate corals <b>became</b> <b>extinct.</b> The cryptostome and trepostome bryozoans also <b>became</b> <b>extinct</b> at this time despite their long history of diversity and abundance earlier in the Paleozoic. Brachiopods suffered greatly and never regained their previous numbers or variety. Ammonoids lost all but one family. Eurypterids and trilobites <b>became</b> <b>extinct.</b> Blastoids <b>became</b> <b>extinct.</b> Crinoids lost all but one family. The echinoids just squeaked past; only one genus {{is known to have}} survived. Typical survivors were small detritivores and sediments feeders. The worst losses were among filter feeders and carnivores.|$|R
5|$|P. l. sinhaleyus, {{known as}} the Sri Lanka lion, appears to have <b>become</b> <b>extinct</b> around 39,000 years ago. It is only known from two teeth found in {{deposits}} at Kuruwita. Based on these teeth, P. Deraniyagala erected this subspecies in 1939.|$|E
5|$|The Choristodera, a {{generally}} crocodile-like group of uncertain phylogeny (possibly archosaurian) also survived the event, only to <b>become</b> <b>extinct</b> in the Miocene. Studies on Champsosaurus palatal teeth {{suggest that there}} were dietary changes among the various species across the KT event.|$|E
5|$|Two {{thousand}} years later, humans have <b>become</b> <b>extinct</b> and Manhattan is buried under glacial ice. The Mecha have evolved into an advanced, intelligent, silicon-based form. They find David and Teddy and discover they are original Mecha that knew living humans, making them special.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{creation}} was in 1337 when Roger de Chandos {{was summoned}} to parliament. Most sources read that the title <b>became</b> <b>extinct</b> on his death, although others include a 2nd and 3rd Lord (his son and grandson) before the title <b>became</b> <b>extinct.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lord Chichester had no {{sons and}} on his death in 1653 the baronetcy <b>became</b> <b>extinct.</b> The barony of Dunsmore also <b>became</b> <b>extinct</b> as his stepson John (who had been created a baronet in 1629) had died childless in 1630. The earldom was passed on {{according}} to the special remainder to his son-in-law Lord Southampton (see the Earl of Southampton for earlier history of this title). However, he had no male issue {{and on his}} death in 1667 both earldoms <b>became</b> <b>extinct.</b>|$|R
50|$|The baronetcy <b>became</b> <b>extinct</b> in 1917.|$|R
5|$|Because {{almost all}} {{other species of}} amphidromine gastropods, such as ones within the genera Partula and Achatinella, have already <b>become</b> <b>extinct,</b> the genus Amphidromus, {{containing}} over 110 species, is uniquely useful {{for the study of}} the evolution of asymmetry in animals, and this is why the conservation of this genus is of essential importance to biologists.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to Feuilley's claims, Dubois {{mentioned}} that the Mascarene parrot was not edible which {{may have led to}} Réunion visitors mostly ignoring it. It was the last of the indigenous parrots of Réunion to <b>become</b> <b>extinct.</b> The only endemic bird species on Réunion that disappeared after the Mascarene parrot was the hoopoe starling in the mid-19th century.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the Marquesan Dog. They were {{introduced}} to the Marquesan Islands by the original Polynesian settlers along with domesticated chickens, pigs, and the Polynesian rat. The dog is thought to have <b>become</b> <b>extinct</b> prior to the arrival of Spanish explorers in 1595, although some might have survived beyond this point.|$|E

25|$|Lyall's wren <b>becomes</b> <b>extinct,</b> {{killed by}} cats.|$|R
5|$|The Dukedom was {{inherited}} only in {{the male}} line. As the 3rd Duke had three daughters but no son, the title became extinct. The 1st Duke was also Earl Temple of Stowe, a title which descended through heirs of his relatives should the male line <b>become</b> <b>extinct.</b> Consequently, on the 3rd Duke's death this title, {{with most of the}} Wotton estate, passed to his nephew William Temple-Gore-Langton who became the 4th Earl Temple.|$|E
5|$|The dodo, and its extinction, {{was more}} typical of the extinctions of pigeons in the past. Like many species that {{colonise}} remote islands with few predators, it {{lost much of its}} predator avoidance behaviour, along with its ability to fly. The arrival of people, along with a suite of other introduced species such as rats, pigs, and cats, quickly spelled the end for this species and all the other island forms that have <b>become</b> <b>extinct.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{fossils of}} the Burgess Shale were hidden in store rooms until the 1960s. When Whittington {{and his colleagues}} first began to publish their Burgess finds in the early 1970s, the fossils became central to the debate about how quickly animals arose, and were {{interpreted}} as evidence that all the living bilaterian phyla {{had appeared in the}} Early Cambrian, along with many other phyla that had <b>become</b> <b>extinct</b> {{by the end of the}} Cambrian.|$|E

50|$|The Baronetcy <b>became</b> <b>extinct</b> on his death.|$|R
5|$|The stegosaurians {{were widely}} {{distributed}} geographically {{in the late}} Jurassic. Palaeontologists believe it would have eaten plants such as mosses, ferns, horsetails, cycads, and conifers or fruits. Grazing on grasses, seen in many modern mammalian herbivores, {{would not have been}} possible for Stegosaurus, as grasses did not evolve until late into the Cretaceous Period, long after Stegosaurus had <b>become</b> <b>extinct.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{timelines}} displayed here cover {{events from}} the beginning of the 11th millennium to the furthest reaches of future time. A number of alternate future events are listed to account for questions still unresolved, such as whether humans will <b>become</b> <b>extinct,</b> whether protons decay, or whether or not the earth survives when the sun expands to the red giant.|$|E
5|$|While {{many species}} of pigeons and doves have benefited from human {{activities}} and have increased their ranges, many other species have declined in numbers and some have become threatened or even succumbed to extinction. Among the ten species to have <b>become</b> <b>extinct</b> since 1600 (the conventional date for estimating modern extinctions) {{are two of the}} most famous extinct species, the dodo and the passenger pigeon.|$|E
50|$|The title <b>became</b> <b>extinct</b> {{upon his}} death.|$|R
50|$|Sireniki <b>became</b> <b>extinct</b> {{in early}} January 1997.|$|R
50|$|Following his forfeiture, {{the next}} {{creation}} of the Earldom of March was for Alexander Stuart, Duke of Albany. At {{the death of his}} successor John, the dukedom and earldom <b>became</b> <b>extinct.</b> The next creation was for Robert Stuart, but at his death the earldom again <b>became</b> <b>extinct.</b>|$|R
5|$|As a boy, Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) {{read the}} Comte de Buffon's Histoire Naturelle from the {{previous}} century, as well as Linnaeus and Fabricius. He was brought to Paris by Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1795, {{not long after the}} French Revolution. He soon became a professor of animal anatomy at the Musée National d'Histoire Naturelle, surviving changes of government from revolutionary to Napoleonic to monarchy. Essentially on his own he created the discipline of vertebrate palaeontology and the accompanying comparative method. He demonstrated that animals had <b>become</b> <b>extinct.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{richness}} of high-quality habitats in Yosemite, the brown bear, California condor, and least Bell's vireo have <b>become</b> <b>extinct</b> in the park within historical time, and another 37 species currently have special status under either California or federal endangered species legislation. The most serious current threats to Yosemite's wildlife and the ecosystems they occupy include loss of a natural fire regime, exotic species, air pollution, habitat fragmentation, and climate change. On a more local basis, factors such as road kills {{and the availability of}} human food have affected some wildlife species.|$|E
5|$|Following Alexander's {{death in}} 323 BC, Anatolia was {{subsequently}} divided {{into a number}} of small Hellenistic kingdoms, all of which became part of the Roman Republic by the mid-1st century BC. The process of Hellenization that began with Alexander's conquest accelerated under Roman rule, and by the early centuries of the Christian Era, the local Anatolian languages and cultures had <b>become</b> <b>extinct,</b> being largely replaced by ancient Greek language and culture. From the 1st century BC up to the 3rd century CE, large parts of modern-day Turkey were contested between the Romans and neighbouring Parthians through the frequent Roman-Parthian Wars.|$|E
50|$|A {{brother of}} William I started {{the branch of}} the Lords of Courbezon (House of Baux-Courbezon), which <b>became</b> <b>extinct</b> in 1393. Another brother started the line of Lords of Suze, Solerieux and Barri (House of Baux-Suze-Solerieux-Barri), which <b>became</b> <b>extinct</b> and reverted {{afterwards}} to the counts of Orange.|$|R
50|$|On Lord Wolseley's {{death the}} barony <b>became</b> <b>extinct</b> {{and he was}} succeeded in the viscountcy, {{according}} to the special remainder, by his daughter, Frances, author of Gardens - Their Form and Design (1919). Viscountess Wolseley never married and upon her death in 1936 the viscountcy <b>became</b> <b>extinct.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Irish Elk, or Giant Deer, and the Red Deer both <b>became</b> <b>extinct</b> in Ireland about 10,500 {{years ago}} during the Nahanagan Stadial. The Reindeer <b>became</b> <b>extinct</b> in Ireland about 9500 years ago. Many of their {{skeletal}} remains {{have been found}} well preserved in peat land.|$|R
