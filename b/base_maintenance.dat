40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a framework}} for determining appropriate condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance</b> policy for an industrial system. The framework {{can be considered as}} providing practitioners with guidelines for condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance</b> (CBM) management or as {{the first step in the}} development of an expert system for CBM management. The framework proposes that components of the system of interest be classified using multi-dimensional Pareto analysis, with this classification then indicating appropriate maintenance actions. For a particular component, condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance</b> may then be an appropriate action. In this case, it is proposed that a binary decision tree is used to suggest an appropriate condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance</b> decision model for the component. Such decision models are briefly reviewed. The ideas in the paper are illustrated throughout using examples from condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance</b> and maintenance modelling in general...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} stay competitive, it is {{necessary}} for companies to continuously increase the effectiveness and efficiency of their production processes. High availability has, thus, increased in importance. Therefore, maintenance has gained in importance as a support function for ensuring, e. g., quality products and on-time deliveries. Maintenance, though, is a costly support function. It has been reported that as much as 70 % of the total production cost can be spent on maintenance. Further, as much as one-third of the cost of maintenance is incurred unnecessarily due to bad planning, overtime cost, limited or misused preventive maintenance, and so on. In so, condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance</b> is introduced as one solution for a more effective <b>maintenance.</b> In condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance,</b> critical item characteristics are monitored in order to gain early indications of an incipient failure. Research, though, has shown that condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance</b> has not been implemented on a wide basis. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to investigate how a condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance</b> approach can be implemented in an industrial setting, and to develop a method that can assist companies in their implementation efforts. Further, the research has been divided in three research questions. They focus on: constituents of a condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance</b> approach, decision-making prior implementation of condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance,</b> and finally, the implementation of condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance</b> in a company. By using a systems approach and a case study process, how condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance</b> can be implemented as a routine has been investigated. The result is an implementation method in which four suggested phases are presented. The method starts with a feasibility test. It then continues with an analysis phase, an implementation phase, and an assessment phase. The conclusions can be summarized as follows: implementing condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance</b> consists of many general enabling factors, including management support, education and training, good communication, and motivation etc...|$|R

As {{a part of the}} analysis, Pavement Condition Index (PCI) for several runways, taxiways, and aprons has been determined by MicroPAVER.

Damage analysis determines the time of repeated overlay application. In addition, functional parameters have been included {{to determine the}} time of functional maintenance.
