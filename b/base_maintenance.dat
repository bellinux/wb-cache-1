40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a framework}} for determining appropriate condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance</b> policy for an industrial system. The framework {{can be considered as}} providing practitioners with guidelines for condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance</b> (CBM) management or as {{the first step in the}} development of an expert system for CBM management. The framework proposes that components of the system of interest be classified using multi-dimensional Pareto analysis, with this classification then indicating appropriate maintenance actions. For a particular component, condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance</b> may then be an appropriate action. In this case, it is proposed that a binary decision tree is used to suggest an appropriate condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance</b> decision model for the component. Such decision models are briefly reviewed. The ideas in the paper are illustrated throughout using examples from condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance</b> and maintenance modelling in general...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} stay competitive, it is {{necessary}} for companies to continuously increase the effectiveness and efficiency of their production processes. High availability has, thus, increased in importance. Therefore, maintenance has gained in importance as a support function for ensuring, e. g., quality products and on-time deliveries. Maintenance, though, is a costly support function. It has been reported that as much as 70 % of the total production cost can be spent on maintenance. Further, as much as one-third of the cost of maintenance is incurred unnecessarily due to bad planning, overtime cost, limited or misused preventive maintenance, and so on. In so, condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance</b> is introduced as one solution for a more effective <b>maintenance.</b> In condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance,</b> critical item characteristics are monitored in order to gain early indications of an incipient failure. Research, though, has shown that condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance</b> has not been implemented on a wide basis. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to investigate how a condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance</b> approach can be implemented in an industrial setting, and to develop a method that can assist companies in their implementation efforts. Further, the research has been divided in three research questions. They focus on: constituents of a condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance</b> approach, decision-making prior implementation of condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance,</b> and finally, the implementation of condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance</b> in a company. By using a systems approach and a case study process, how condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance</b> can be implemented as a routine has been investigated. The result is an implementation method in which four suggested phases are presented. The method starts with a feasibility test. It then continues with an analysis phase, an implementation phase, and an assessment phase. The conclusions can be summarized as follows: implementing condition <b>based</b> <b>maintenance</b> consists of many general enabling factors, including management support, education and training, good communication, and motivation etc...|$|R
