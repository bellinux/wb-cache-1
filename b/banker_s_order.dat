40|$|Clearly, a new {{agenda is}} {{emerging}} for private international banks. Political {{issues such as}} human rights {{seem to be a}} current concern. But what about democracy? What about political regimes? Are they taken into account by private banks when they decide whether to invest in a country? Put another way, do private banks have democratic political preferences? In this article, we focus on cross-border lending from international <b>bank(er)</b> <b>s.</b> The questions asked are as follows. Do <b>bank(er)</b> <b>s</b> react positively (that is by increasing their lending) when an emerging democracy appears? Do we witness increased bank lending after democratic transitions? Lastly, is there any relation between democratic consolidation and bank lending?...|$|R

In this paper, the author develops and tests {{the hypothesis that}} underpricing serves {{as a form of}} insurance against legal liabili ty and the associated damages to the reputations of investment <b>banker</b> <b>s.</b> The empirical results, based on samples of initial public offering s of common stocks that were brought to the market before and after t he Securities Act of 1933, provide considerable support for the impli cit insurance hypothesis. Specifically, gross underpricing and market segmentation between prestigious and fringe investment bankers in or iginating unseasoned new issues appear to be peculiar to the post- 193 3 era.

The issue was arranged by London <b>bankers</b> <b>S.</b> G. Warburg. and listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Allen & Overy, one of London's Magic Circle of law firms, were the lawyers on the transaction.Their conception was largely a reaction against the imposition of the Interest Equalization Tax in the United States. [...] The goal of the tax was to reduce the US balance-of-payment deficit by reducing American demand for foreign securities. Americans could bypass the costly tax and Europeans could keep open access to US capital.|$|R

40|$|The New Lebanon Shaker {{community}} {{developed the}} Children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Order</b> for {{the offspring of}} adult converts primarily because they believed 2 ̆ 2 worldly 2 ̆ 2 family relationships hindered spiritual 2 ̆ 2 travel. 2 ̆ 2 Children were isolated from the adults for two main reasons: first, the Shakers were a celibate society and did not recognize marital and affectional relationships within their community; and secondly, the Shakers believed socialization and control of both adults and children into the Shaker way of life would be more successful if the children and adults were separated;This research traces {{the development of the}} New Lebanon Children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Order</b> from the founding of the United Society of Believers in America to 1900. The primary focus of the study is how the Children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Order</b> contributed to the gradual demise of the Society after the 1840 s. The history of the Shakers, gathering children into the Society, and their daily life, education, and conduct, are discussed;The conclusions of this research suggest that the process in the Society of separating children from adults also separated children from the future of the sect. Children 2 ̆ 7 s caretakers and teachers {{did not seem to be}} able to instill in the youth a long-lasting regard for the Society 2 ̆ 7 s beliefs or a spiritual commitment to its perpetuation, nor were they able to supplant the children 2 ̆ 7 s needs for emotionally intimate relationships;In some ways this research revises earlier studies that suggest a more positive emotional environment existed in the Children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Order</b> during the nineteenth century. It is not suggested that children were neglected physically at any point in Shaker history, but when the complex issues of socialization to promote commitment, the value of emotionally intimate relationships and family affectional ties, and the costs and rewards of membership are evaluated, a different picture of the New Lebanon Children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Order</b> during the nineteenth century seems more likely...|$|R

From any <b>order</b> <b>s</b> (even) to <b>order</b> <b>s</b> + 2, a determining conclusion is obtained. And from any <b>order</b> <b>s</b> (even) to <b>order</b> <b>s</b> + 4, an algebraic equation system, when s is evaluated whose solution gives a rise by 4 in order, is about to be set up. As examples, for the cases of s = 2 and s = 4, the numerical results are to be gained...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the interaction between}} price and inventory decisions in an oligopoly industry {{and its implications for}} the dynamics of prices. The work extends existing literature and especially the work of Hall and Rust (2007) to endogenous prices and strategic oligopoly competition. We show that the optimal decision rule is an (<b>S,</b> <b>s)</b> <b>order</b> policy and prices and inventory are strategic substitutes. Fixed ordering costs generate infrequent orders. Consequently, with strategic competition in prices, (S, s) inventory behavior together with demand uncertainty generates endogenous cyclical patterns in prices without any exogenous shocks. Hence, the developed model provides a promising framework for explaining dynamics of commodity markets and especially observed autocorrelation in price fluctuations.
