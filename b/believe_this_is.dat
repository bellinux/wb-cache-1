5|$|Valerian {{holds an}} {{imperial}} council in Byzantium, attended by several named dignitaries, {{none of them}} otherwise attested and some holding offices not known to exist until the following century, at which the general 'Ulpius Crinitus' (a name apparently chosen to evoke the military glories of the Emperor Trajan) takes the young Aurelian (destined to be another military Emperor) as his adopted son. There are no grounds to <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> anything other than invention.|$|E
5|$|Many prelates lived {{around the}} street during the Middle Ages, {{including}} the Bishops of Salisbury and St Davids and the Abbots of Faversham, Tewkesbury, Winchcombe and Cirencester. Tanning of animal hides became established on Fleet Street {{owing to the}} nearby river, though this increased pollution leading to a ban on dumping rubbish by the mid-14th century. Many taverns and brothels were established along Fleet Street and have been documented {{as early as the}} 14th century. Records show that Geoffrey Chaucer was fined two shillings for attacking a friar in Fleet Street, though modern historians <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> apocryphal.|$|E
5|$|Developing neurons travel {{toward the}} {{olfactory}} bulb along the RMS via glial tubes, which mark {{the division between}} the differentiated nervous tissue and the tissue with embryonic characteristics. Uniquely, the cells travel tangential to the brain surface, parallel to the pial surfaces rather than radially like most developing neurons. Neurons that migrate tangentially are typically believed to migrate independently of radial glia but in the RMS researchers <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not the case. Adult rat glial tubes have been observed via light and electron microscopy and described as a meshwork of astrocytic bodies and processes. They have been determined to be astrocytes based on the typical expression of GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and more specifically as protoplasmic astrocytes based on their morphology. Furthermore, these glial cells {{were found to be}} positive for vimentin expression, a protein commonly found in embryonic or immature glial cells. The developing neurons are identified by their expression of the cell surface molecule, a polysialylated (PSA) embryonic form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) called PSA-NCAM, as well as β-tubulin, a protein often found in postmitotic neuroblasts, proving the cells of RMS are committed to developing into neurons and will do so upon entry into the olfactory bulb. With the removal of NCAM, the neuroblasts scatter, proving the importance of NCAM in chain formation. The neurons form both clusters and chains along the lumen of these glial tubes.|$|E

25|$|Before 1981, the {{approval}} process of justices was usually rapid. From the Truman through Nixon administrations, justices were typically approved within one month. From the Reagan administration to the present, however, {{the process has}} taken much longer. Some <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> because Congress sees justices as playing a more political role than in the past. According to the Congressional Research Service, the average numberof days from nomination to final Senate vote since 1975 is 67 days (2.2 months), while the median is 71 days (or 2.3 months).|$|E

25|$|Cinnabar {{and mercury}} mining {{has been part}} of the {{southern}} Sierra Gorda since the Pre classic period. This mining remained important until the 1970s, when most of the commercial mines closing and the last, in Maconí, closed in 2000. However, there are still at least six families known to mine the element on a very small scale. According to researchers, the long history of mercury mining here has caused the contamination of the environment as it built up over time. They <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> behind the high levels of certain chronic diseases in the region.|$|E
25|$|Governance and {{decision}} making is conducted at a special meeting for worship—often called a meeting for worship with a concern for business or meeting for worship for church affairs at which all members can attend, as in a Congregational church. Quakers consider {{this to be a}} form of worship, conducted in the manner of meeting for worship. They <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the gathering of believers who wait upon the Lord to discover God's will, believing that they are not making their own decisions. They seek to understand God's will for the religious community, via the actions of the Holy Spirit within the meeting.|$|E
25|$|Players {{discovered}} that the Switch's firmware included an Easter egg to allow players to play the NES Golf title via a built-in emulator. While Nintendo has not confirmed its presence, journalists and players <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a tribute to Nintendo's former president Satoru Iwata; Golf was programmed by Iwata, the game can only be accessed if the system clock is set to July 11, the day that Iwata died, and use the Joy-Con in a motion similar to how Iwata would present in his Nintendo Direct presentations. Some Japanese users referred to this as a omamori (charm) left by Iwata himself.|$|E

25|$|Some Jews {{believe that}} strict Jewish law {{requires}} that one should fast {{on the day of}} a parent's Yahrzeit; although most <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not required, some people do observe the custom of fasting {{on the day of the}} Yahrtzeit, or at least refraining from meat and wine. Among many Orthodox Jews it has become customary to make a siyum by completing a tractate of Talmud or a volume of the Mishnah on the day prior to the Yahrtzeit, in the honor of the deceased. A halakha requiring a siyum ("celebratory meal"), upon the completion of such a study, overrides the requirement to fast.|$|E
25|$|The other protein, TAS1R3, {{is present}} and {{identical}} {{to that of other}} animals, and the relevant taste buds are still present but inactive. Such a genetic marker found in the entire family and not other animals must be the result of a mutation in an early ancestor; as a deletion mutation it could not revert, and thus would be inherited by all descendants, as the evolutionary tree branched out. Some scientists now <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the root of the cat family's extremely specialized evolutionary niche as a hunter and carnivore. Their modified sense of taste would cause them to some degree to ignore plants, a large part of whose taste appeal derives from their high sugar content, in favor of a high-protein carnivorous diet, which would still stimulate their remaining taste receptors.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{found that}} having an older sibling, {{especially}} an older brother, affected how girls viewed sex and sexuality. Girls with older brothers held more traditional views about sexuality {{and said they}} were less interested in seeking sex, as well as less interested responding to the sexual advances of boys compared with girls with no older siblings. Researchers <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> because older siblings model gender roles, so girls with older siblings (especially brothers) may have more traditional views of what society says girls and boys should be like; girls with older brothers may believe that sexual intercourse is mostly for having children, rather than for gaining sexual pleasure. This traditional view can inhibit them from focusing on their own sexualities and desires, and may keep them constrained to society’s prescribed gender roles.|$|E

25|$|The APSAC Task Force {{describes}} how the conceptual focus of these treatments is the child's individual internal pathology and past caregivers rather than current parent-child relationships or current environment. If the child is well-behaved outside the home this is seen as successful manipulation of outsiders, rather than as evidence of {{a problem in the}} current home or current parent-child relationship. The APSAC Task Force noted that this perspective has its attractions because it relieves the caregivers of responsibility to change aspects of their own behavior and aspirations. Proponents believe that traditional therapies fail to help children with attachment problems because it is impossible to establish a trusting relationship with them. They <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> because children with attachment problems actively avoid forming genuine relationships. Proponents emphasize the child's resistance to attachment and the need to break it down. In rebirthing and similar approaches, protests of distress from the child are considered to be resistance that must be overcome by more coercion.|$|E
25|$|Modern maps of Oz {{are almost}} universally drawn with the Winkies {{in the west}} and the Munchkins in the east, {{although}} west and east often appear reversed. Many Oz fans <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the correct orientation, perhaps as a result of Glinda's spell, which has the effect of confusing most standard compasses; perhaps resembling its similarity to the world Alice found through the looking glass in which everything was a mirror image; or perhaps just reflecting the alien nature of Oz. In Robert A. Heinlein's book The Number of the Beast he posits that Oz is on a retrograde planet, meaning that it spins in the opposite direction of Earth so that the sun seems to rise on one's left as one faces north. March Laumer's The Magic Mirror of Oz attributes the changes to a character named Till Orangespiegel attempting to turn the Land of Oz orange.|$|E
25|$|Puntland has {{the lowest}} rate of poverty in Somalia, with 27%, {{compared}} to 50% in Somaliland and 57% in Mogadishu. Experts <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> because of higher consumption and higher labour force participation. Households in Puntland consume a higher quantity per capita per item and more items per household. The lower rate of poverty {{does not appear to}} be driven by household size, as the average in Puntland is 5.2, compared to 5.7 in Somaliland and 4.5 in Mogadishu. Puntland is doing better in various important indicators of well-being. For instance, the literacy rate in Puntland is 64% compared to the national average of 55%. Additionally, households in Puntland also outperform the average in other educational outcomes such as enrolment and educational attainment. 70% of households in Puntland have access to improved water sources compared to the national average of 58%. Therefore, Puntland’s higher performance on non-monetary indicators of well-being are inline with its lower rate of poverty.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the film was seminal to {{gathering}} support from other Arab countries against the French, the film was banned in Algeria both under French occupation and post-independence. Some <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> due to Djamila Bouhired's marriage to French lawyer Jacques Vergès, but others <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a tactic {{on the part of the}} Algerian government to further silence both the heroic role of women in the revolution and the highlighting of rape and torture in their narratives.|$|R
25|$|The {{theory was}} {{introduced}} in the 1950s by Raul Prebisch, Director of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America after observing that economic growth in wealthy countries did not translate into economic growth in poor countries. Dependency theorists <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> due to the import-export relationship between rich and poor countries. Walter Rodney, in his book How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, used this framework when observing the relationship between European trading companies and African peasants living in postcolonial states. Through the labour of peasants, African countries are able to gather large quantities of raw materials. Rather than being able to export these materials directly to Europe, states must work with a number of trading companies, who collaborated to keep purchase prices low. The trading companies then sold the materials to European manufactures at inflated prices. Finally the manufactured goods were returned to Africa, but with prices so high, that labourers were unable to afford them. This led to a situation where the individuals who labored extensively to gather raw materials were unable to benefit from the finished goods.|$|E
500|$|Small {{whales are}} known to engage in complex play behaviour, which {{includes}} such things as producing stable underwater toroidal air-core vortex rings or [...] "bubble rings". There are two main methods of bubble ring production: rapid puffing of a burst of air {{into the water and}} allowing it to rise to the surface, forming a ring, or swimming repeatedly in a circle and then stopping to inject air into the helical vortex currents thus formed. They also appear to enjoy biting the vortex-rings, so that they burst into many separate bubbles and then rise quickly to the surface. Some <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a means of communication. Whales are also known to produce bubble-nets for the purpose of foraging.|$|E

After considering a return for one more season to reach 10,000 career rushing yards, Campbell retired during the preseason of 1986, feeling that the beating he had taken during his career had taken {{too much of a}} toll. [...] "I'm a man; I'm not a little boy," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the best thing—not only for myself, but for the Saints."
