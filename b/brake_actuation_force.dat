40|$|Abstract. In {{near-field}} levitation, {{an object}} can be levitated vertically upward above vibrating surface of an ultrasonic transducer. In this case, a repulsive force acts on the object. On the other hand, {{it has been}} reported that a minute object can be suspended vertically downward under the vibrating surface with a small gap in the air. We call this phenomenon ultrasonic suspension. Under the suspension, an attractive force acts on the object. When an object is suspended, there is restoring force, which pulls the object to the center of the vibrating surface. Our aim is to characterize the <b>actuation</b> <b>forces</b> under the suspension. Simultaneous measurement of vertical and horizontal <b>actuation</b> <b>forces</b> is required. A servo type measuring mechanism was proposed. A 1 DOF mechanism with a cantilever and a voice coil motor (VCM) was fabricated as a prototype.

Ionic Polymer-Metal Composite (IPMC) {{has been}} {{utilized}} as an actuator in several robotic {{applications such as}} the actuator for its locomotion and gripper of the end effector. However, due to its low <b>actuation</b> <b>force</b> which is normally less than 10 gf (depend on dimension), the application has been limited to small scale robot. Hence, in this research we propose a multilayer structure of IPMC actuator and investigate the <b>actuation</b> <b>force</b> increment. Besides, parametric study was also conducted to determine the force-to-weight ratio and the bending displacement. The obtained results had been compared to single ply IPMC actuator at the same thickness. The result shows that the increment of IPMC layer had increased the actuating force up to 30 % for two layers and 40 % for three layers. In addition, utilizing multilayered IPMC had reduced the stiffness constraint for thicker IPMC. This finding would be useful in designing stage of a small scale robot that require higher <b>actuation</b> <b>force</b> at a higher bending displacement...|$|R

40|$|Morphing {{aircraft}} offer superior properties {{as compared}} to non-morphing aircraft. They can achieve this by adapting their shape depending on the requirements of various conflicting flight conditions. These shape changes are often associated with large deformations and strains, and hence dedicated morphing concepts are developed {{to carry out the}} required changes in shape. Such intricate mechanisms are often heavy, which reduces, or even completely cancels, the performance increase of the morphing aircraft. Part of this weight penalty is determined by the required actuators and associated batteries, which are mainly driven by the required <b>actuation</b> <b>force</b> and energy. Two underexposed influences on the <b>actuation</b> <b>force</b> and energy are the flight condition at which morphing should take place and the order of the morphing manoeuvres, also called morphing scheduling. This paper aims at highlighting the importance of both influences by using a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with different morphing mechanisms as an example. The results in this paper are generated using a morphing aircraft analysis and design code that was developed at the Delft University of Technology. The importance of the flight condition and a proper morphing schedule is demonstrated by investigating the required <b>actuation</b> <b>forces</b> for various flight conditions and morphing sequences. More importantly, the results show that there is not necessarily one optimal flight condition or morphing schedule and a tradeoff needs to be made.

40|$|Conventional brakes {{require a}} {{powerful}} actuator, leading to large, heavy {{and in most}} cases energy consuming brakes. This paper introduces a fundamen-tally different brake concept called statically balanced brakes (SBBs). SBBs do not require any <b>actuation</b> <b>force</b> to maintain a braking torque and only have to move a small mass to vary that torque. Therefore, their energy consumption is potentially very low. In an SBB, one of the two friction surfaces is connected through springs to a braking block. This braking block is connected through a mechanism to a second set of springs, the other side of which connects to the ground. The total energy in the two sets of springs is constant, which results in a zero-force characteristic at the braking block. The position of this statically balanced braking block determines the displacement of the first set of springs and thus the normal force between the friction surfaces. We categorize mech-anisms {{that can be used in}} SBBs and show two embodiments: one with leaf springs with a range of positions with negative stiffness and one with torsion springs and a non-linear cam mechanism. Results show that the <b>actuation</b> <b>force</b> can be reduced by approximately 95 - 97 % in comparison to regular brakes. This shows that in SBBs, the <b>actuation</b> <b>force</b> can be almost eliminated and thus showing the potential of SBBs to be small, lightweight and energy efficient...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a computational study of structural vibration control that is realized by switching a magnetostrictive transducer {{between high and}} low stiffness states. Switching is accomplished by either changing the applied magnetic field with a voltage excitation or changing the shunt impedance on the transducer's coil (i. e., the magnetostrictive material's magnetic boundary condition). Switched-stiffness vibration control is simulated using a lumped mass supported by a damper and the magnetostrictive transducer (mount), which is represented by a nonlinear, electromechanical model. Free vibration of the mass is calculated while varying the mount's stiffness according to a reference switched-stiffness vibration control law. The results reveal that switching the magnetic field produces the desired change in stiffness, but also an undesired <b>actuation</b> <b>force</b> that can significantly degrade the vibration control. Hence, a modified switched-stiffness control law that accounts for the <b>actuation</b> <b>force</b> is proposed and implemented for voltage-controlled stiffness switching. The influence of the magnetomechanical bias condition is also discussed. Voltage-controlled stiffness switching is found to introduce damping equivalent to a viscous damping factor up to about 0. 25; this is shown to primarily result from active vibration reduction caused by the <b>actuation</b> <b>force.</b> The merit of magnetostrictive switched-stiffness vibration control is then quantified by comparing the results of voltage- and shunt-controlled stiffness switching to the performance of optimal magnetostrictive shunt damping...|$|R
30|$|The {{correlation}} between the wear behavior of a heavy commercial vehicle (HCV) brake liner tested under controlled laboratory conditions and that in actual field conditions is investigated. A brake liner study for friction and wear is performed on an inertia brake dynamometer (IBD) at different temperatures (200 °C, 250 °C, and 300 °C) using 6000 <b>brake</b> <b>actuations</b> in a laboratory. The total wear loss of the brake liner at three different temperatures for 6000 <b>brake</b> <b>actuations</b> in IBD {{is found to be}} 1.12 mm. The actual field test is conducted on four different HCVs, namely, a city bus (CB), a high speed bus (HSB), a highway truck (HWT), and a tipper lorry (TL). These HCVs run at different terrain/traffic conditions and load conditions. When comparing the predicted life of the brake liner through the IBD test with the actual life of the brake liner in different HCVs, a vast difference is observed. Due to the large variation of liner life observed between the actual and predicted tests, an extensive field test is conducted. In the field test, the liner with identical formulation is fitted in the four types of HCVs. The predicted life of the liner using IBD is then correlated with the field test observation and a correlation factor is determined. Based on this correlation factor, the predicted life of the liner and the achieved life on the HCV are found to be fairly close. This study will be useful to design the friction material formulation and to predict the actual life of the brake liner for various HCVs.|$|R
