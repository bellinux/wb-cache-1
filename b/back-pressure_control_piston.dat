40|$|<b>Back-pressure</b> <b>control</b> {{of traffic}} signal, which computes the control phase to apply {{based on the}} {{real-time}} queue lengths, has been proposed recently. Features of it include (i) provably maximum stability, (ii) low computational complexity, (iii) no requirement of prior knowledge in traffic demand, and (iv) requirement of only local information at each intersection. The latter three points enable it to be completely distributed over intersections. However, one major issue preventing backpressure control from being used in practice is the utilization of the intersection, especially if the control phase period is fixed, as is considered in existing works. In this paper, we propose a utilization-aware adaptive algorithm of <b>back-pressure</b> traffic signal <b>control,</b> which makes {{the duration of the}} control phase adaptively dependent on the real-time queue lengths and strives for high utilization of the intersection.

40|$|AbstractTraffic signal {{control and}} route {{guidance}} are {{the oldest and}} most applied dynamic traffic management measures. Most of the time they operate in a local mode, although there is trend toward network-wide traffic management. For traffic signal control already several network systems existed, but so far the integration with route guidance is lacking. In this paper we describe a new strategy to integrate traffic signal control and route guidance, based on the principles of <b>back-pressure</b> <b>control.</b> The algorithms developed are tested in a theoretical network and it was shown that traffic signal <b>control</b> based on <b>back-pressure</b> <b>control</b> performs well. Using back-pressure for route guidance required some assumptions which are open for debate. The results show that the average density is not such a good measure for route pressure and that travel time as a pressure variable performs better. A combination of factors of pressure based on density and travel time seems to be the best choice. Using back-pressure for both signal control and route guidance gave promising results, although the differences with optimized local control were small. Future research is recommended on the fine-tuning of the back-pressure traffic signal model, and on further integration and coordination of the control strategies. On the part of route guidance, finding representative route pressure values and making the model applicable of larger networks requires more research...|$|R
40|$|A {{key problem}} in {{wireless}} networking {{is how to}} choose a link activation schedule and associated powers in concert with routing decisions to optimize throughput. <b>Back-pressure</b> <b>control</b> policies are optimal in this context, but the underlying power control problem is non-convex. <b>Back-pressure</b> power <b>control</b> (BPPC) was recently shown to be NP-hard, yet amenable to successive convex approximation strategies that deliver manifold improvements in end-to-end throughput relative to the prior art in wireless networking. A drawback is that existing implementations are centralized, whereas practical power control has to be distributed across the network. This paper fills this gap by developing a distributed version of the core step of successive convex approximation of the BPPC problem, building upon the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMoM). The resulting protocol enjoys favorable properties relative to dual decomposition - based implementations, and allows tight approximation of the BPPC objective in all interference regimes.

40|$|Bad traffic {{conditions}} {{can be improved}} by regulating traffic demand and network capacity. Dynamic Traffic Management (DTM) systems allocate temporal and spatial utilization of infrastructures and vehicle fleets by means of dynamic signals. By timely response to changing {{traffic conditions}} DTM goals, in terms of effective, safe and reliable use of the infrastructure, can be met. Two important trends {{in the field of}} DTM are: a shift from local control measures towards network-wide control; a shift from collective traffic information towards individual advice. Individual advice can be transmitted via in-car technology, however, up until now in-car systems are typically used to improve the (route) choice of the individual road user, whereas DTM aims at improving the network performance as a whole. Network-wide traffic control is complicated by the dynamic nature of traffic itself and the dynamic effects of control measures, especially if the network and DTM structure is complex. Route guidance can make a significant contribution to network-wide DTM. Using in-car navigation to transmit individual directions, it is expected to improve the network performance (better use of the available capacity, higher throughput and stability, and less spill-back), and reduce the travel time for the individual road user as well. Finding the right route guidance configuration is a complex task, that should take potential unfavourable effects and coordination into account. Moreover, integrating traffic signal control at intersections with route guidance is a logical step. Considering the complex nature of the problem and the need for (real-time) responsive control actions, a simplified traffic control model is suggested. The concept of <b>back-pressure</b> <b>control</b> has recently been applied to the problem of controlling a network of signalized intersections. The development of a route guidance algorithm based on <b>back-pressure</b> <b>control,</b> integrated with a back-pressure model for signalized intersections, is to be considered. The main research problem in this thesis is to determine the feasibility and potential benefits of such a system. The main objective of this thesis is to develop a framework that integrates route guidance and signal control based on the back-pressure principle, and determine its feasibility and potential benefit. Conditions that further specify the objective include a focus on network-wide control, on optimizing network conditions (and secondarily find a trade-off with road user benefits), on real-time control, and on a generic approach. The literature review starts with a brief overview route guidance. Applying route guidance has advantages and pitfalls. Route guidance can be modelled as a way to manipulate route choice. Often route guidance is used to minimize the travel time of the individual road user, using route guidance to improve the conditions for the network and road users as a whole isn't often done in operational route guidance. The <b>back-pressure</b> <b>control</b> methodology originated from communication networks, where it is applied to the problem of delivering data packets via a network of nodes and servers. The back-pressure algorithm assigns the servers to be activated and the data they should transfer, based on server capacity and queue differences (queues for specific data groups). The main strengths of <b>back-pressure</b> <b>control</b> are maximization of throughput and network stability. The basic back-pressure algorithm can been extended to cope with finite queues and delay. On the application of traffic signal <b>control</b> <b>back-pressure</b> <b>control</b> has been used in literature. The concept aims to activate the signalling phase that has the highest total weight, a summation of the weights of the allowed traffic streams. The weight is the product of pressure and service rate (saturation flow). The pressure of a traffic stream is the difference between the queues at the incoming link and outgoing links (weighted by proportion). There are several variants to this basic model. In communication networks the use of routes {{is a result of the}} algorithm, whereas for traffic signal control the route choice is used as an input from a separate process. The back-pressure concept can however also be used as a method for route guidance. Instead of determining the right phase to be activated, the task is to determine the ratio to direct traffic to following links. Route pressure values can be formulated to expresses how filled up the route is. Route pressure and service rate are less straightforward to define than for the intersection control. A choice model is to be used to determine the ratio of routes, based on the product of route pressure and service rate. The chosen control approach is a traffic control loop in which the traffic process is monitored, controllers for traffic signal control and route guidance calculate new settings which are implemented to the traffic process by means of the traffic signalling system and in-car navigation system. The traffic signal controller can be fed by route guidance information to improve the estimate turn probabilities. The model is a reactive feedback control type. The research approach includes a list of design choices and limitations for traffic signal control and route guidance, as well as requirements related to the experiment to be conducted and the simulation tools. A general back-pressure algorithm for traffic signal control has been designed, with two main variants: one with a fixed cycle time that assigns phase durations for one or more cycles, and one with short time slots that repeatedly activates the dominant phase. Pressure values are based on representative link densities, are normalized to the jam density and can be extended by a power function that increases the relative weight of higher pressures. The necessary turning probabilities are based on measurements or on route guidance settings, which integrates traffic signal control and route guidance. For route guidance a general algorithm has been proposed as well. As a first attempt of service rate, the link capacity of the first outgoing link of the route is used. Furthermore a number of variants for the algorithm have been considered. The first variant is simple but myopic and observes only the first link of each route, which also limits the number of routes that need to be considered. An important limitation of this variant is that congestion on links further downstream is not taken into account. Other variants observe complete routes (from the en-route position). A path size logit choice model is used to determine the proportions for each route. A pressure value that represents the whole route needs to be determined. This can be done by taking the (weighted) average of the link pressures, or by a method that takes outliers specifically into account. Travel time as a measure of user satisfaction, allowing road users to use the shortest routes, can be incorporated into the method. The overall utility function of a route can be written as: BP_r = α_ 1 P_route,r + α_ 2 P_firstlink,r + α_ 3 P_user,r. The three terms represent the (total) route pressure, the pressure of the first link, and the travel time value. The simulation environment is based on the macroscopic simulation model DSMART. It uses a kinematic wave model, based on the fundamental diagram, space and time discretization. Aggregated flows carry traffic along the links and System Class Dynamics (SCD) ensure the separation of changes in traffic composition and correct handling of traffic dynamics at the nodes. Periodically, traffic controllers are called to update the activated control strategies, based on the proposed traffic control and route guidance algorithms. Traffic signal control objects directly influence the traffic flow and route guidance is enforced by manipulating turn ratios at intersections and diverges. The simulation experiments are divided into three parts: case 1 examines traffic signal control, case 2 focuses on route guidance, and case 3 combines traffic signal control and route guidance. For traffic signal <b>control,</b> <b>back-pressure</b> <b>control</b> is a good way to generate high throughput at the intersections, while keeping the queues evenly distributed and within boundaries. <b>Back-pressure</b> signal <b>control</b> based on time slots is more effective than the cycle time based version. Some aspects of the algorithm and its practical use require special attention. For route guidance an optimal use of back-pressure has not yet been found, as the results are on a most part lacking compared to the standard route choice model. Two main aspects are the definition of a representative route pressure, and the capacity of routes related to the assignment of (destination specific) traffic to each route. The performance is expected to be better if the pressure were (partly) based on the critical links, instead of on average density. Yet the basic algorithm that was formulated works to some extent, and so far the simulated effects can be understood and are up for improvement. It was also found that a `pressure' function that includes not only route densities, but also travel time can give good results. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates the possibility to create a methodology, based on <b>back-pressure</b> <b>control,</b> that integrates traffic signal control and route guidance. Traffic signal <b>control</b> based on <b>back-pressure</b> <b>control</b> performs well in the simulations, especially the variant with time slots. Throughput is high and queues remain within reasonable boundaries. It is difficult to fully integrate traffic signal control and route guidance, contrary to the straightforward algorithm in the field of wireless communication networks. A modest step of integration is to use route guidance settings to determine the necessary turning probabilities at the intersection. Using back-pressure for route guidance requires (artificial) design choices. The challenge is to define a representative function of route pressure or utility, and to combine this with a service rate value, in order to obtain a high throughput and stability with minimum delays. Several ideas have been presented. The average density has turned out not a good measure for route pressure. It is possible to combine factors of pressure based on density and travel time, in order to use the shortest routes in case of low traffic, and shift to the routes with open capacity if needed.

40|$|The {{control of}} a network of signalized intersections is considered. Previous works {{proposed}} a feedback control belonging to the family of the so-called <b>back-pressure</b> <b>controls</b> that ensures provably maximum stability given pre-specified routing probabilities. However, this optimal back-pressure controller (BP*) requires routing rates and a measure of the number of vehicles queuing at a node for each possible routing decision. It is an idealistic assumption for our application since vehicles (going straight, turning left/right) are all gathered in the same lane apart from the proximity of the intersection and cameras can only give estimations of the aggregated queue length. In this paper, we present a back-pressure traffic signal controller (BP) that does not require routing rates, it requires only aggregated queue lengths estimation (without direction information) and loop detectors at the stop line for each possible direction. A theoretical result on the Lyapunov drift in heavy load conditions under BP control is provided and tends to indicate that BP should have good stability properties. Simulations confirm this and show that BP stabilizes the queuing network in {{a significant part of the}} capacity region.

This architecture uses distinct point to point TCP connections between adjacent pairs of end-systems, together with a window based <b>back-pressure</b> <b>control,</b> which links adjacent pairs of TCP connections via an application-layer mechanism. Each end-system maintains forwarding buffers and a back-up buffer storing copies of the forwarded packets.

All data points compared in this study are recorded at MBT timing with a relative air-fuel ratio ([gamma]) of 1. For the baseline case (CR = 9. 24, speed = 2000 rpm, coolant = 80 °C), increased crevice volume results in an indicated efficiency degradation of 0. 3 - 0. 5 %-points per 1000 mm 3. This absolute decrease corresponds to a 1. 2 - 1. 5 % relative decrease for a 100 % increase in crevice volume; referenced to the <b>control</b> <b>piston</b> crevice modification. Decreasing crevice volume leads to a gain in indicated efficiency of 2. 3 - 3. 5 %-points per 1000 mm 3, which corresponds to a 6. 9 - 11. 8 % relative increase for a 100 % decrease in crevice volume; referenced to the <b>control</b> <b>piston</b> crevice modification. Results of the experimental investigation, when compared across compression ratio, engine speed, and coolant temperature, show that the crevice effect on efficiency is largely independent of these three parameters. Large gains from decreased piston crevice volume prompt renewed discussions on piston top land, top ring, and crown design. by Patrick M. Smith. Thesis: S.

40|$|Abstract. To {{solve the}} problem of piston {{striking}} cylinder and pumping insufficiency, an optimization method of concrete open-loop pumping displacement control is derived and presented. In order to <b>control</b> <b>piston</b> stroke effectively, the optimization model of concrete open-loop pumping displacement control parameters is built based on considering the system’s open-loop characteristics. Satisfying the physical constraint of preventing piston striking cylinder and maximizing piston’s effective stroke are taking as the evaluation criterion during the modeling process. Using this method, simulation and experimental research has been proceeded in a type of concrete pump. The result shows that concrete pumping piston can not only meet the noninterference physical constraint, but also increase the pumping efficiency significantly under variable loads. The optimization model provides a new method {{that can be used in}} engineering practice for solving the design problem of concrete pumping open-loop control system under variable loads...|$|R

However, both piston stroke and piston offset require detection and control in valved compressors. In order to manufacture linear compressor in large scale, then a simple, robust, and cheap control system is required {{with a minimum}} of sensors and actuators. This work introduces an approach to sensing the position of the piston using a search coil. The piston stroke is detected by calculating the peak-to-peak flux linkage in relation to the measured drive voltage and current. The piston offset is proportional to an integrated modulus of the back electromotive force (emf) of the search coil. Two PID (proportional-integral-derivative) controllers were developed to <b>control</b> the <b>piston</b> stroke by adjusting the drive voltage and a solenoid valve and bleed flow to <b>control</b> the <b>piston</b> offset. Experimental results validate the proposed compressor control technique...|$|R
