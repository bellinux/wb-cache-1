5|$|After {{years of}} {{speculation}} about possible successor shows, in May 2017 HBO commissioned five screenwriters – Max Borenstein, Jane Goldman, Brian Helgeland, Carly Wray and a fifth writer {{yet to be}} announced – to develop individual Game of Thrones successor series. All of the writers are to be working individually with George R. R. Martin. Martin said that all the concepts under discussion are prequels, and some may be set outside Westeros. He also ruled out Robert's Rebellion (the overthrow of Daenerys's father by Robert Baratheon) as a possible idea. D. B.

5|$|At the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International, Whedon {{announced}} the film would be subtitled Age of Ultron. Despite the subtitle, {{the film is}} not based on the 2013 comic book miniseries Age of Ultron.

Whedon added that Ultron's origin would differ from his comics roots, and that Hank Pym would not <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>with</b> Ultron's creation. Whedon disclosed that Edgar Wright had rights to the character first through his inclusion in Ant-Man, which was already in development. He also thought that Ultron needed to be conceived through the Avengers and since they already had Tony Stark and Bruce Banner on the team, it would not make sense to bring in a third scientist. Whedon also said the film would have a darker tone due to Ultron's involvement.|$|E

A nerve agent filling the house will kill them within two hours, but Kramer assures Eric that following his own game, simply sitting and chatting with John, will see his son Daniel returned to him unharmed. At Kerry's urging, Eric agrees in order to buy time for the tech team to arrive and trace the video signal.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, Kippenberger {{was offered}} the {{position}} of Editor-in-Chief of New Zealand's largest-ever publishing project, the Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War 1939–45.
