5|$|Actor Ryo Ishibashi {{wanted to}} work with Miike and agreed to the role. He commented that despite not being a great fan of horror films, he enjoyed scripts, such as that of Audition, that showcased human nature. Model Eihi Shiina was cast in the film as Asami. Shiina's career was {{primarily}} as a model and she only began acting after being offered a film role while she was on holidays. Shiina first learned about Miike through his film Blues Harp, which made her interested in meeting the director. When Shiina first met Miike, they <b>began</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> her opinions on love and relationships. On their second meeting, Miike asked Shiina to play the part of Asami. Shiina thought that the opinions and feelings she expressed to Miike were the reason she was cast in the role, and she tried to play the role as naturally as she could without going over the top.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1958 Fleming and his friend, Ivar Bryce, <b>began</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the {{possibility}} of a Bond film. Later that year, Bryce introduced Fleming to a young Irish writer and director, Kevin McClory, and the three of them, together with Fleming and Bryce's friend Ernest Cuneo, formed the partnership Xanadu Productions, named after Bryce's Bahamian home, but which was never actually formed into a company. In May 1959 Fleming, Bryce, Cuneo and McClory met first at Bryce's Essex house and then in McClory's London home as they came up with a story outline which was based on an aeroplane full of celebrities and a female lead called Fatima Blush. McClory was fascinated by the underwater world and wanted to make a film that included it. Over the next few months, as the story changed, there were ten outlines, treatments and scripts. Numerous titles were proposed for these works, including SPECTRE, James Bond of the Secret Service and Longitude 78 West.|$|E
5|$|The plenum {{put forward}} three points {{to solve the}} {{problems}} alleged by Tho; (1) to get party cadres to focus on technical economic and management responsibilities, (2) cadres were to be organized and get specialized training in economic and administrative fields to reequip them with information on how to run an increasingly complex economy, and (3) engineer a shift in the internal balance of power.In a Nhân Dân (The People) editorial, Lê Đức Thọ stressed the need to go beyond political slogans and remonstration to enhance the level of management skills of party cadres in party-level organizations. Lê Đức Thọ wanted to change the party's role in the economy from that of implementer to one of supervisor. The central leadership faced an obstacle; most party cadres had what the party leadership considered an outdated education from 20 to 30 years ago, while the party lacked young cadres. To solve this problem, the central party leadership <b>began</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the need to introduce personnel planning, a retirement age, rotation of officials and tenure length for cadres and sensitive posts.|$|E

5|$|Silver Reef's {{residents}} {{rebuilt the}} businesses {{that had been}} destroyed, but the town soon began to decline. In 1881, the Stormont Mining Company and the Barbee & Walker Mining Company had to decrease wages from $4 per day to $3.50 per day in all of their mines except the Savage mine (a Stormont property). In response to the decrease in wages, the Silver Reef Miners Union was formed. In February 1881, union members <b>began</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> striking the mines, and as word of this potential strike spread, the Stormont Mining Company discharged those of its miners {{who were part of}} the Miners Union. In response, the discharged union members escorted the company's superintendent, Washington Allen, out of Silver Reef. Allen immediately went to the Second District Court in Beaver and filed a lawsuit against the union members. Before they went to court, the union members held a meeting and decided to shut down the Savage mine. Led by Matthew O'Loughlin, the president of the Silver Reef Miners Union, they walked through Silver Reef in rows of two, and, upon arriving at the Savage mine, O'Loughlin and nine other men went into the hoisting works and ordered the engineer on duty to shut down the pumps that kept water from the water table out of the mine. After the pumps were shut down, the group of ten went into the Savage mine and ordered everyone out.|$|E

In July of that year June married William Oliver Whitmore II.|$|E
25|$|The {{film was}} {{conceived}} as an animated film bracketed with live-action sequences. The rest would involve {{a combination of}} computer-generated visuals and back-lit animation. Lisberger planned to finance the movie independently by approaching several computer companies but had little success. However, one company, Information International Inc., was receptive. He met with Richard Taylor, a representative, and they <b>began</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> using live-action photography with back-lit animation {{in such a way}} that it could be integrated with computer graphics. At this point, Lisberger already had a script written and the film entirely storyboarded with some computer animation tests completed. He had spent approximately $300,000 developing Tron and had also secured $4–5 million in private backing before reaching a standstill. Lisberger and Kushner took their storyboards and samples of computer-generated films to Warner Bros., MGM, and Columbia Pictures– all of which turned them down.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} night, 24 March, a {{crowd of}} between 7–8,000 men assembled in North Quay, and into Queen and William Street, where speakers <b>began</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> taking the law into their own hands. As the anger amongst the crowd grew, a large group broke away from it and carrying a large Australian flag proceeded to cross Victoria Bridge singing patriotic songs. Assembling at Merivale Street they began to move towards the hall. Finding their way blocked by a force of between 40–60 police mounted on horseback and armed with rifles and bayonets, {{under the command of}} the police commissioner, Frederic Urquhart, a clash broke out in which over 100 men received bayonet wounds. The fighting lasted for two hours. In the end between 14 and 19 police officers were injured and three police horses were shot, one of which later died, while 19 of the injured ex-servicemen needed to be evacuated by ambulance.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} Moorer fight, Foreman <b>began</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> a {{potential}} superfight against Mike Tyson (the youngest ever heavyweight champ). The WBA organization, however, demanded he fight their No. 1 challenger, {{who at the}} time was the competent but aging Tony Tucker. For reasons not clearly known, Foreman refused to fight Tucker and allowed the WBA to strip him of that belt. He then went on to fight mid-level prospect Axel Schulz of Germany in defense of his remaining IBF title. Schulz was a major underdog. Schulz jabbed strongly from long range and grew increasingly confident as the fight progressed. Foreman finished the fight with a swelling over one eye, but was awarded a controversial majority decision. The IBF ordered an immediate rematch to be held in Germany, but Foreman refused the terms and found himself stripped of his remaining title. However, Foreman continued to be recognized as the Lineal Heavyweight Champion.|$|E
500|$|On April 22, 1947, Skelton was {{censored by}} NBC two minutes into his radio show. When {{he and his}} {{announcer}} Rod O'Connor <b>began</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Fred Allen being censored the previous week, they were silenced for 15 seconds; comedian Bob Hope was given the same treatment once he began referring to the censoring of Allen. Skelton forged on with his lines for his studio audience's benefit; the material he insisted on using had been edited from the script by the network before the broadcast. He had been briefly censored the previous month {{for the use of}} the word [...] "diaper". After the April incidents, NBC indicated it would no longer pull the plug for similar reasons.|$|E

During the course of the meeting, Behr became convinced that Darren was performing the Fontaine piece, having moved into it seamlessly. Darren had deliberately avoiding simply reading the script, as he disliked doing cold reads; instead, he had intentionally improvising things that he felt that the character would say. After Darren left, Behr excitedly told the other writers how good he was, but that perhaps they should still see other actors. Producer Hans Beimler replied, [...] "Are you out of your mind? What are you talking about? Vic Fontaine was just in the room. There's no question, there's no question! He's the guy!" ...|$|E

[...] In January 1905 he was ready to outline his plan to potential members of the trust, with the exception of Republic's president, A. W. Thompson. [...] When Thompson was advised of the scheme, he declared there would be no such trust with Republic as a member; when put to a formal vote, Republic's board members voted down the idea of joining a trust. During this time, Gates was able to purchase enough shares of Tennessee Coal and Iron to give him a controlling interest in the company.|$|E
500|$|Beavan threw {{a quality}} start for Seattle, while Humber retired all 27 batters he faced, as his fastball reached [...] The closest a batter {{got to a}} hit was Dustin Ackley's fourth inning line drive {{over the head of}} right fielder Alex Ríos, which {{resulted}} in a warning track leaping catch. The Mariners <b>began</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Humber's dominance in the fifth inning as they sought to break up the perfect game. Humber recorded the final out on a full-count check-swing strikeout of Brendan Ryan. The ball got away from catcher Pierzynski, but home plate umpire Runge ruled that Ryan had failed to check his swing. Ryan took steps toward first base but, when he saw that Pierzynski had successfully gathered the ball and thrown to first, he argued the call with Runge. The FOX Sports broadcast never showed any angle which definitively proved whether Ryan had successfully checked his swing, but many fans and media members felt the call was incorrect. Ryan himself refused to discuss the play after the game and offered nothing but praise for Humber.|$|E

[...] Although some applauded this statement, many others continued booing when Madonna mentioned discrimination against gay people. Madonna's publicist Liz Rosenberg issued a statement saying that [...] "Madonna has been touring with a phenomenal troupe of Roma musicians who made her aware of the discrimination toward them in several countries so she felt compelled to make a brief statement, [...] She will not be issuing a further statement." [...] In January 2009, Florin Cioabă, self-proclaimed King of Roma, announced that he wished to present Madonna with a gold plaque to thank the singer for criticising discrimination against the Roma people.|$|E
