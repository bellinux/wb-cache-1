In this way, the study adds to the literature on financial market frictions during the Great Depression, which aside from analyzing securities prices, typically investigates the behavior of credit-related variables that lag current conditions, such as bank failures, bankruptcies, the stock of money, or outstanding bank loans.; In particular, the real level of <b>bankers</b> <b>acceptances</b> and their use relative to noncollateralized commercial paper were strongly and positively related to spreads between corporate and treasury bond yields. Also significant were short-run events, such as the October 1929 stock market crash and the 1933 bank holiday episode that sparked flights to quality in the bond market and a flight to collateral (BAs) in the money market and perhaps away from the loan market. Furthermore, these shifts in the composition of external finance were large, supporting the view that financial frictions and reduced credit availability may have {{played an important role in}} depressing the U. S. economy during the 1930 s.; The paper also relates these findings to the current financial crisis by examining how the relative use of commercial paper reacted to yield spreads during the current crisis, taking into account Federal Reserve actions to improve liquidity conditions in the money markets. Results suggest that these efforts may have, at least so far, helped prevent the commercial paper market from melting down to the extent seen during the early 1930 s.

5000|$|A <b>banker's</b> <b>acceptance,</b> or BA, is a promised future payment, or time draft, {{which is}} {{accepted}} and guaranteed by {{a bank and}} drawn on a deposit at the bank. The <b>banker's</b> <b>acceptance</b> specifies the amount of money, the date, and the person to whom the payment is due. After acceptance, the draft becomes an unconditional liability of the bank.

The discussion draws mainly on the experiences of four countries, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and China. Significant efforts have been made, or are under consideration, in all countries to develop a more efficient framework for monetary management, and to provide greater autonomy to central banks in macro stabilization policies. These objectives call for a coordinated approach to strengthening a wide range of central banking functions simultaneously, and require that a core mass of supporting financial sector reforms be implemented to ensure effective transformation and stabilization with minimal transitional costs.

The paper focuses {{on a number of}} issues suggested by international organizations for countries and bank supervisors to consider in imposing standards for risk diversification in the credit portfolio. The issues reviewed for each country are the large exposure limits, the definition of credit exposure (including application on a consolidated basis), and the definition of a group of related borrowers. The paper concludes that most of the countries reviewed set limits on large exposures for banks and define a related group of borrowers in line with recommended international standards.

50|$|Bankers' {{acceptances}} {{date back}} to the 12th century when they emerged as a means to finance uncertain trade, as banks bought bills of exchange at a discount. During the 18th and 19th centuries, there was an active market for sterling bankers' acceptances in London. When the United States Federal Reserve was formed in 1913, one of its purposes was to promote a domestic bankers' acceptance market to rival London's to boost US trade and enhance the competitive position of US banks. National banks were authorized to accept time drafts, and the Federal Reserve was authorized to purchase certain eligible bankers' acceptances, but today the US central bank no longer buys <b>banker's</b> <b>acceptances</b> (but instead buys mostly US government bonds from a Primary dealer).|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the day-of-the-week effect for three primary money market {{instruments}} in Canada. The sample period is 1980 - 2009. Design/methodology/approach – The authors use three approaches. First, a parametric t-test is employed to determine if a particular day-of-the-week mean return is significantly different from zero, using both a full sample and a trimmed sample. Next, the Wilcoxon signed ranked test is utilized to assess whether the median weekday return is different from zero for each day. Lastly, a binary regression model is used to test if Monday's mean return is different from other days. Findings – The traditional Monday effect is prevalent in the 1980 s for corporate paper and treasury bills (TB), but not for <b>bankers</b> <b>acceptances</b> (BA). In the 1990 s, the Monday effect disappears completely. However, in the 2000 s the Monday effect reappears, but is positive (it reverses) for both corporate paper and BA. The authors also find strong support for Wednesday being a high return day, which concurs with related money market studies. Research limitations/implications – While the results are statistically significant, the economic significance is dubious. This study helps market participants in that it shows that they need to allow for distinct day-of-the-week patterns when using yield spreads. Practical implications – One practical implication for practitioners is to time purchases of Canadian money market securities for Monday when returns are low (relying on the results of the full sample period). Issuers should time sales for non-Mondays when returns are higher and yields are lower. Originality/value – This study is original in that it is the first one to analyze day-of-the-week effects in the Canadian money market. The authors compare the results to studies that focus on the US market. Canada, Day-of-the-week effect, Financial investment, Financial markets, Returns...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{associates}} {{both the}} increase in risk taken by wholesale banks in the United States and the decline in earnings at wholesale banks in Japan with {{a reduction in the}} franchise value of wholesale banking. In contrast with the conventional view that relates the franchise value of banking to informational advantages over other lenders, this paper argues that banks’ franchise value originates in their provision of liquidity and payments services to their customers. Therefore, the decline in corporate demand for bank liquidity is identified as a major factor explaining the fall of the franchise value. The paper also analyzes recent proposals for banking reform and assesses their relevance for dealing with the problems of wholesale banks.

40|$|Over {{the past}} seventy years, the {{proposal}} to narrow the scope of banks has occurred more and more frequently in financial debates and research. Narrow banking would prevent deposit-issuing banks from lending {{to the private sector}} and restrict nonbank intermediaries from funding investments with demand deposits.

This study reviews the literature on the subject, contrasts the concept of narrow banking with contemporary banking theories, and evaluates the potential consequences of narrow banking on finance and the real economy.

40|$|This {{study will}} {{identify}} specific periods {{during the years}} 1975 - 1989 where change in bank risk may have occurred. The work of Kane and Unal (1988) is most similar to this study, although different econometric methodology was utilized. ^ Four return measures are tested. The returns to equity holders {{will be used as}} in many other studies. Certificates of deposit represent insured deposits. <b>Bankers</b> <b>acceptances</b> represents the uninsured debt. Interbank lending will be measured by federal funds. ^ For all of the debt series, the spread between the specific series and the treasury bill rate will be used as the risk measure. The regression coefficient will represent the risk premium of the debt series. ^ An econometric technique will be used to find switch point dates rather than to prespecify them as in traditional event study methodology. There are two procedures which have been used to do so. The first is the Goldfeld-Quandt switching regressions method developed by Goldfeld and Quandt (1972). The other is a combination of the cumulative sum of the squares of recursive residuals method, developed by Brown, Durbin, and Evans (1975), and the log likelihood ratio technique from Quandt (1958). ^ In this study, the cumulative sum of the squares of recursive residuals method and the log likelihood ratio will be used in the manner suggested by Hays and Upton (1986). The Hays and Upton contribution consists of a ratcheting technique using increasingly more observations. ^ After all switch points have been found and heteroskedasticity tested for, parameter estimates for the time periods between the dates will be obtained. If no heteroskedasticity was detected then ordinary least squares will be used. White 2 ̆ 7 s consistent covariance matrix will be employed when heteroskedasticity is found. In addition, if autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity is present, then that model will be used. ^ A binary dummy variable will be included which will take the value zero before and one after the date being considered. Tests will be performed on these coefficients for changes in risk. ...|$|E

The lower targets set for the increase in both consumption and investment in the 1976 – 80 plan relative to the rates achieved during 1971 – 75, reflected the government’s policy of moderating the growth of domestic demand.

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{experience}} of five developing countries in reforming their financial systems illustrates the benefits and risks, and provides lessons on the factors which contribute to successful financial sector reforms. Financial sector reforms need to be supported by active monetary policy, and the adoption of new monetary control procedures early in the reform program; reforms should be sequenced consistently with the broader program of macroeconomic adjustment. The pace of liberalization of interest rates and credit should also take account of the solvency of financial and nonfinancial firms. A minimal system of prudential regulation is an essential element of successful financial sector reform.

40|$|This study {{looks at}} {{the first two years}} of the banking crisis that erupted in Indonesia in late 1997. It finds that the banking sector was weak at the outset, and that {{governance}} problems intensified the crisis and seriously delayed its resolution. Although a strategy was put in place over the initial months, protracted delays in implementation led to an explosion in the costs of resolution. By end- 1999, the critical elements to reconstruct the banking system were in place, and the political transition seemed completed; but, in a continuing unsettled environment, the new authorities still faced daunting challenges.

40|$|The {{financial}} {{turmoil of}} the late 1990 s prompted a broad search for tools and techniques for detecting and preventing financial crises, and more recent episodes of instability have high lighted the importance of continuous monitoring of financial systems {{as a tool for}} preventing crises. This paper looks at the development of measures of financial sector soundness and of methods to analyze them. The authors propose two sets of financial soundness indicators that are considered useful for periodic monitoring, and for compilation and dissemination efforts by national authorities. They highlight the substantial advance made in recent years in measuring and analyzing financial soundness indicators, and specify areas where more work is needed.
