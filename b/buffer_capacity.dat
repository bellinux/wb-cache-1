5|$|Buffer {{solutions}} {{also play}} a key role in analytical chemistry. They are used whenever there is a need to fix the pH of a solution at a particular value. Compared with an aqueous solution, the pH of a buffer solution is relatively insensitive to the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base. The <b>buffer</b> <b>capacity</b> of a simple buffer solution is largest when pH=pKa. In acid–base extraction, the efficiency of extraction of a compound into an organic phase, such as an ether, can be optimised by adjusting the pH of the aqueous phase using an appropriate buffer. At the optimum pH, the concentration of the electrically neutral species is maximised; such a species is more soluble in organic solvents having a low dielectric constant than it is in water. This technique is used for the purification of weak acids and bases.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the open equilibrium scenario above, many swimming pools are managed by addition of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) to about 2 mM as a buffer, then control of pH through use of HCl, NaHSO4, Na2CO3, NaOH or chlorine formulations that are acidic or basic. In this situation, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is far from equilibrium with atmospheric CO2. Progress towards equilibrium through outgassing of CO2 is slowed by (i) the slow reaction H2CO3 ⇌ CO2(aq) + H2O; (ii) limited aeration in a deep water column and (iii) periodic replenishment of bicarbonate to maintain <b>buffer</b> <b>capacity</b> (often estimated through measurement of ‘total alkalinity’).|$|E
40|$|A key step in {{the design}} of cyclo-static {{real-time}} systems is the determination of <b>buffer</b> <b>capacities.</b> In our multiprocessor system, we apply back-pressure, which means that tasks wait for space in output <b>buffers.</b> Consequently <b>buffer</b> <b>capacities</b> affect the throughput. This requires the derivation of <b>buffer</b> <b>capacities</b> that both result in a satisfaction of the throughput constraint, and also satisfy the constraints on the maximum <b>buffer</b> <b>capacities.</b> Existing exact solutions suffer from the computational complexity that is associated with the required conversion from a cyclo-static dataflow graph to a single-rate dataflow graph.

40|$|Existing {{temporal}} {{analysis and}} buffer sizing techniques for real-time stream processing applications ignore that FIFO buffers bound interference between tasks {{on the same}} processor. By considering this effect it can be shown that a reduction of <b>buffer</b> <b>capacities</b> {{can result in a}} higher throughput. However, the relation between <b>buffer</b> <b>capacities</b> and throughput is non-monotone in general, which makes an exploitation of the effect challenging. In this paper a buffer sizing approach is presented which exploits that FIFO buffers bound interference between tasks on shared processors. The approach combines temporal analysis using a cyclic dataflow model with computation of <b>buffer</b> <b>capacities</b> in an iterative manner and thereby enables higher throughput guarantees at smaller <b>buffer</b> <b>capacities.</b> It is shown that convergence of the proposed analysis flow is guaranteed. The benefits of the presented approach are demonstrated using a WLAN 802. 11 p transceiver application executed on a multiprocessor system with shared processors. If buffers without blocking writes are used an up to 25 % higher guaranteeable throughput and up to 23 % smaller <b>buffer</b> <b>capacities</b> can be determined compared to existing approaches. For systems using buffers with blocking writes the guaranteeable throughput is even up to 43 % higher and <b>buffer</b> <b>capacities</b> up to 11 % smaller...|$|R
25|$|Boric acid in {{equilibrium}} {{with its}} conjugate base the borate ion {{is widely used}} (in the concentration range 50 - 100ppm boron equivalents) as a primary or adjunct pH buffer system in swimming pools. Boric acid is a weak acid, with pKa (the pH at which buffering is strongest because the free acid and borate ion are in equal concentrations) of 9.24 in pure water at 25°C. But apparent pKa is substantially lower in swimming pool or ocean waters because of interactions with various other molecules in solution. It will be around 9.0 in a salt-water pool. No matter which form of soluble boron is added, within the acceptable range of pH and boron concentration for swimming pools, boric acid is the predominant form in aqueous solution, {{as shown in the}} accompanying figure. The boric acid - borate system can be useful as a primary buffer system (substituting for the bicarbonate system with pKa1 = 6.0 and pKa2 = 9.4 under typical salt-water pool conditions) in pools with salt-water chlorine generators that tend to show upward drift in pH from a working range of pH 7.5 - 8.2. <b>Buffer</b> <b>capacity</b> is greater against rising pH (towards the pKa around 9.0), as illustrated in the accompanying graph. The use of boric acid in this concentration range does not allow any reduction in free HOCl concentration needed for pool sanitation, but it may add marginally to the photo-protective effects of cyanuric acid and confer other benefits through anti-corrosive activity or perceived water softness, depending on overall pool solute composition.|$|E
2500|$|Until recent history, {{groundwater}} was not {{a highly}} utilized resource. In the 1960s, more and more groundwater aquifers developed. Changes in knowledge, technology and funding have allowed for focused development into abstracting water from groundwater resources away from surface water resources. These changes allowed for progress in society such as the [...] "agricultural groundwater revolution", expanding the irrigation sector allowing for increased food production and development in rural areas. Groundwater supplies {{nearly half of all}} drinking water in the world. The large volumes of water stored underground in most aquifers have a considerable <b>buffer</b> <b>capacity</b> allowing for water to be withdrawn during periods of drought or little rainfall. This is crucial for people that live in regions that cannot depend on precipitation or surface water as a supply alone, instead providing reliable access to water all year round. As of 2010, the world's aggregated groundwater abstraction is estimated at approximately 1,000km3 per year, with 67% used for irrigation, 22% used for domestic purposes and 11% used for industrial purposes. The top ten major consumers of abstracted water (India, China, United States of America, Pakistan, Iran, Bangladesh, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and Italy) make up 72% of all abstracted water use worldwide. Groundwater has become crucial for the livelihoods and food security of 1.2 to 1.5 billion rural households in the poorer regions of Africa and Asia.|$|E
