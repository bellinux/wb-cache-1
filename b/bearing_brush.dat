40|$|Protein {{heterogeneity}} {{is currently}} {{one of the}} leading problems in formulation of therapeutic proteins. The effectiveness of therapeutic proteins is diminished when they exhibit heterogeneity due to aggregates and degradation by-products. Furthermore, guidelines set forth by the FDA require therapeutic proteins to have high stability as well as high purity. With development time on the order of years and costs incurred in the millions, pharmaceutical companies are investing more time in finding fast and efficient ways to screen for protein heterogeneity. Current methods such as native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) are time consuming, require large amount of samples, and are not always easily implementable with instrumentation. Our approach to these issues involves the use of silica colloidal crystals <b>bearing</b> <b>brush</b> layers of polyacrylamide. Using established correlations between molecular weight and reduced mobility, selectivity is compared in silica colloidal crystals and gels. Due to low broadening effects in colloidal crystals, fast sieving separations of proteins have been observed in capillaries over distances as short as 6. 5 mm in 72 seconds with exceptionally low plate heights. When adapted to a 96 well plate format, throughput can be increased a 100 fold. Our work explores the feasibility of high throughput characterization of protein aggregates and degradation products using a clinical antibody donated by the Eli Lilly Corporation. ^ Chapter 4 and 5 cover a project related to the investigation of the structural backbone of asphaltenes, which are a cause of serious concern to the petroleum industry. They have many undesirable effects such as precipitating in the pipelines and some of their metal content will foul catalysts used in oil processing. There are several endeavors dedicated to elucidating their structures. The one our group undertook involved synthesizing smaller asphaltene compounds that retained some of the key structural features associated with real asphaltenes. Fragmentation studies of these model compounds using tandem mass spectrometry revealed an unexpected fragmentation pattern which is meant to be used in elucidating the structure of real asphaltenes compounds. ^ In Chapter 6, work toward the synthesis of the photoaffinity labeled analog of Callipeltin A is presented. Capilleltin A is a natural product with desirable anti-HIV activity. Unfortunately, not much is known about its mode of action with its therapeutic targets. In order to learn more, we decided to replace the hydroxyl group of one of the non-proteogenic amino acid residues by a highly reactive group such as azide. From past studies, such a replacement is not expected to affect the bioactivity of Callipeltin A. A β-MeOTyr azide analog was synthesized and fully characterized as part of the progress made. ...|$|E

50|$|Because of {{its high}} {{electrical}} conductivity, copper is commonly used in coil windings, <b>bearings,</b> collectors, <b>brushes,</b> and connectors of motors, including the highest quality motors. Copper’s greater conductivity versus other materials enhances the electrical energy efficiency of motors.

Aluminium is an alternate material in smaller horsepower motors, especially when motors are not used continuously.|$|R

40|$|The Atomic Force Microscope is a {{powerful}} tool for probing the surface of a sample at the nanoscopic scale. Indeed it can give information about the sample topography and map various physical or chemical surface properties. But in parallel to these "classical" applications, there exist other very interesting techniques. They include sensing applications in which the adsorption of molecules on the cantilever is quantitatively monitored and surface engineering applications in which the tip is used as a pen to write chemical features on a substrate. The aim of this thesis was to develop innovative ways to go further in these two series of applications and to improve their performances. The main strategy was {{to increase the number of}} reactive sites on the cantilevers in order to interact faster and with more sensitivity. To reach this objective, AFM cantilevers were functionalized with polymer brushes which provide stable surfaces that can contain a large amount of reactive side groups per unit area. First, the study of the kinetics of (physico) chemical reactions at the submicrometric scale was undertaken with cantilevers <b>bearing</b> reactive <b>brushes.</b> Two different methods were investigated: the frequency shift method and the deflection method. The first method was based on the fact that the resonance frequency of a lever is inversely proportional to its mass which was increased upon adsorption of analytes by the reactive brushes while the second one was based on the variation of the surface stress of the cantilever upon adsorption of molecules by the reactive brushes. Second, a surface-confined "click" reaction was catalyzed at the nanoscopic scale with functionalized polymer <b>brushes</b> <b>bearing</b> ligands for metals that were grafted from an AFM tip. The scan speed was a determining parameter and in every case, the patterns were thicker than a monolayer of the grafted molecules. The proposed mechanism of the lithography involves two steps: the formation of crystal seeds by the catalysis of the reaction and the subsequent pi stacking of aggregates that were absorbed in the brush.

40|$|The {{movement}} of leukocytes {{to the site}} of inflammation in response to injury or infection is orchestrated by chemokines binding and signaling through cognate receptors.

In this manuscript we describe the synthesis of polymers and silica nanoparticles <b>bearing</b> polystyrene sulfonate <b>brushes</b> to mimic the sulfated tyrosine residues. We show that both the polymers and nanoparticles possess high binding affinity for the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) in monomeric and dimeric form.

Especially wiper motor for automobiles is important part because of improving visual comfort for the driver and the passengers. Therefore, we have dealt with the reliability test procedure of wiper motor. The failures such as wear-out of <b>brush,</b> <b>bearing</b> damage, motor coil burnout are caused by the electrical and mechanical operating for low and high actions of wiper motor. In this research, we have qualitatively selected the efficient test items through the analysis of the life and potential failures of wiper motor. So, wiper motor itself requires an estimation of life causing failure of brush wear out in order to operate the system safely. We have tested six wiper motors. The result is established by employing the weibull plot. We validated the life of wiper motor to the experimental result...|$|R
50|$|The key {{difference}} between an alternator and a generator is that the alternator delivers AC (alternating current) to the external circuit, while the generator delivers DC (direct current). In both machines alternating current is induced in the armature, but the type of current delivered to the external circuit depends {{on the way in}} which the induced current is collected. In an alternator, the current is collected <b>brushes</b> <b>bearing</b> against slip-rings; in a generator, a form of rotating switch called the commutator is placed between the armature and the external circuit. The commutator is designed to reverse the connections with the external circuit at the instant of each reversal of induced current in the armature, producing rectified current or direct current. This rectified current is not pure like the current of a voltaic cell but is instead a pulsating current that is constant in direction and varying in intensity.|$|R
30|$|One such {{alternative}} {{is the use}} of surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) method to covalently attach polymer brushes in a tunable and controllable manner [33 – 35]. This approach allows the preparation of polymer <b>brushes</b> <b>bearing</b> reactive pendant groups, such as hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, or epoxide groups, which provide highly reactive binding sites for bioactive macromolecules at the brush interfaces [36]. Hence, surface-initiated ATRP is a promising approach for the functionalization of the PCL surface, as it allows for the control of the length and density of the polymer brushes, which leads to tunable grafting efficiency for the desired biologically active molecules. However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, few studies have been devoted to modifying biodegradable polyester polymers using surface-initiated ATRP for the improvement of their cytocompatibility [37]. Moreover, no systematic study has been performed to investigate the relationship between the surface density of the grafted bioactive molecules and cellular functions in order to demonstrate the tunable grafting efficiency of this approach.|$|R

Concurrently, we have built a multiaxial press {{that can be used to}} determine A and B, and also to learn more about the multiaxial behaviour of concrete. Its main originality lies in its <b>brush</b> <b>bearings</b> platens, which minimize lateral confinement. With bearings of this type, the cracking observed with uni- and biaxial loadings is perpendicular to the unloaded directions, demonstrating the role of extensions.

Introduction: The dynamo tested is a 1. 5 K. W. machine generating 115 volts {{at a speed}} of 1850 R. P. M. and is short shunt compound wound. It is constructed so as to require little care, having self oiling ring <b>bearings</b> and <b>brushes</b> {{that do not require}} shifting with increase of load. The terminal block {{on the side of the}} machine is arranged so simply that no mistake could be made in making the connections. External Characteristic. The curve following shows the external characteristic of the dynamo. In obtaining the data for this curve the dynamo was run at constant speed. The rheostat in the shunt field was adjusted so that a voltmeter placed across the terminals reads 110 volts when the dynamo is running without load. The position of the rheostat arm is not changed during the test. A variable resistance and an ammeter are placed in the external circuit. The resistance is decreased, thus increasing the load until the limit of the machine is reached. Readings are taken simultaneously of line amperes and terminal volts for a number of intermediate points. This data is plotted with terminal volts as ordinates and line amperes as abscissas. The object of compounding a dynamo is to maintain a constant voltage at some point on the circuit. The voltage of a shunt dynamo gradually falls as the load increases, therefore in order to maintain a constant potential regulation of the rheostat would be necessary. By compounding the regulation is automatic and no adjustment of the rheostat is necessary...|$|R
40|$|The precise {{design of}} {{bioactive}} surfaces, {{essential for the}} advancement of many biomedical applications, depends on achieving control of the surface architecture {{as well as on the}} ability to attach bioreceptors to antifouling surfaces. Herein, we report a facile avenue toward hierarchically structured antifouling polymer brushes of oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylates via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) presenting photoactive tetrazole moieties, which permitted their functionalization via nitrile imine-mediated tetrazole-ene cyclocloaddition (NITEC). A maleimide-functional ATRP initiator was photoclicked to the side chains of a brush enabling a subsequent polymerization of carboxybetaine acrylamide to generate a micropatterned graft-on-graft polymer architecture as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). Furthermore, the spatially resolved biofunctionalization of the tetrazole-presenting brushes was accessed by the photoligation of biotin-maleimide and subsequent binding of streptavidin. The functionalized <b>brushes</b> <b>bearing</b> streptavidin were able to resist the fouling from blood plasma (90 % reduction with respect to bare gold).

40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{investigation}} is a commutated rotating coil magnetometer element. One detector with quadrature sets of brushes {{could be used to}} align a second element with the total earth's field. It was lay contention that a commutated detector with a suitable filter and contact-modulated d-c amplifier would reduce the noise and stray pick-up considerably over existing design and simplify the application of a servomechanism as well. In order to determine the feasibility of such a device, the design and construction of the commutated detector, filter and contact-modulated amplifier were necessary. The armature consisted of 39 coils of 150 turns each of enameled no. 34 B. & S. copper wire spaced by fiber separators protruding from a luclte core.

These readings were checked and rechecked over a period of thirty minutes with no difference observed greater than the possible error in scale readings.

40|$|Surface-grafted styrene-based {{homopolymer}} and {{diblock copolymer}} <b>brushes</b> <b>bearing</b> semifluorinated alkyl side groups were synthesized by nitroxide-mediated controlled radical polymerization on planar silicon oxide surfaces. The polymer brushes {{were characterized by}} X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS), and time-dependent water contact angle measurements. Angle-resolved XPS studies and water contact angle measurements showed that, {{in the case of}} the diblock copolymer brushes, the second block to be added was always exposed at the polymer-air interface regardless of its surface energy. Values of z*/Rg were estimated based on the radius of gyration, Rg, of the grafted homopolymer or block copolymer chains for the grafted brushes and thickness of the brush, z*. The fact that z*/Rg > 1 suggests that all these brushes are stretched. These results support the idea that after grafting the first block onto the surface the nitroxide-end capped polymer chains were able to polymerize the second block in a “living” fashion and the stretched brush so formed was dense enough that the outermost block in all cases completely covers the surface. NEXAFS analysis showed a relationship between the surface orientation of the fluorinated side chains and brush thickness with thicker brushes having more oriented side chains.

40|$|PaperPg. 191 - 197. This article {{covers a}} user?s experience, {{viewpoint}} and resolution, with destructive stray shaft currents on a centrifugal split-case design compressor. The compressor {{is driven by}} a 33, 000 HP 13 -stage condensing turbine. Shaft currents have been noted by many rotating equipment users for years and had been mostly associated with wet turbine steam causing a static current. A common type grounding brush, in continuous contact with the shaft, was used to bleed off all excess currents to ground. These brushes generally proved successful where ?static? conditions were present. However, at times severe currents were generated causing quick <b>bearing</b> deterioration. The <b>brushes</b> simply could not carry the current away. Approximately ten years ago, a theory that stray currents could also be generated by high magnetic levels and fields within the equipment itself evolved. Currents generated in this manner were then termed ?electromagnetic? in nature. Electromagnetic currents are definitely more destructive than static currents. The tell-tale signs are distractive from static currents as metal can actually {{be removed from the}} shaft, definite erosion (frosting) patterns are set up and frosting can and does appear at different locations throughout the machine during the magnetic destructive process. These stray currents have been present on this particular compressor since plant start-up in September of 1971. Necessary outages, {{as a direct result of}} bearing failure, have occurred as frequently as one month and as infrequently as 1 ? years. Many paths have been followed in the attempt to resolve the bearing failures prior to implementing the electromagnetic current history. Solutions ranged from installation and modification of current drain brushes, to a total radial bearing redesign by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).

40|$|This thesis {{includes}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} behaviour of steel fibre reinforced high performance concrete (SFRHPC) under biaxial loading conditions. Also included are constitutive models to enable numerical predictions of the strength behaviour of such a material. Within the experimental stage a large biaxial test machine was designed and manufactured. The load capacity of each axis was 2000 kN. Special thought {{was given to the}} load platen system because of the friction which occurs between the platen system and the concrete specimen. <b>Brush</b> <b>bearing</b> platens and solid steel blocks with and without Teflon friction reducing pads were tried. Because the brush platen and the Teflon pads were constantly damaged during testing, solid steel block platens were finally used. For tests where tension loads were involved, experiments were carried out with dog-bone shaped specimens and specimens glued on to the platens. Finally, the tension loads were transferred through threaded rods cast into the specimens and connected to the machine patterns with screws. Modern control schemes and high speed data acquisition systems were used to monitor the material response and to collect experimental stress and strain results. The principal deformations were monitored and the crack patterns and failure modes examined. Failure envelopes were developed based on the strength data for each fibre variable. The load capacity of SFRHPC under biaxial load conditions was found to be larger than for plain HPC for all fibre types and volume fractions. The stress-strain recordings indicated a linear behaviour almost up to failure. The examined failure mode between plain and steel fibre HPC was similar and all specimens failed very suddenly with a splitting failure type. The test variables included four different types of hooked ended steel fibres with different fibre volume fractions from plain to 2 % in 0. 5 % steps. The specimens were tested under the entire range of stress combinations including uniaxial compression and tension and biaxial compression-compression and compression-tension. As a result the specimen still failed in an explosive manner but the pieces were still connected together by fibres after failure. The biaxial strength compared to the uniaxial strength increased more, as observed with normal strength concrete. With the addition of fibres the biaxial strength behaviour of HPC was almost the same as for plain normal strength concrete. The deformation characteristics of plain and SFRHPC showed a linear behaviour up to a higher stress than normal strength concrete. In fact the linear limit was almost as high as the failure load. The examined strength data was used to model the biaxial strength envelopes of HPC and SFRHPC using different methods. These included the Ottosen failure criterion and the Willam and Warnke failure criterion. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
