In reality, however, it had <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sinecure and was essentially a court dignity devoid of any but ceremonial duties.|$|E
5|$|The first fishes lacked {{jaws and}} used {{negative}} pressure to suck their food in through their mouths. The jaw in the bowfin {{is a result}} of their evolutionary {{need to be able to}} catch and eat bigger and more nutritious prey. As a result of being able to gather more nutrients, Bowfin are able to live a more active lifestyle. The jaw of a bowfin has several contributions. The maxilla and premaxilla are fused and the posterior chondrocranium articulates with the vertebra which allows the jaw freedom to rotate. The suspensorium includes several bones and articulates with the snout, brain case, and the mandible. When the jaw opens epaxial muscles lift the chondrocranium which is attached to the upper jaw, and adductor muscles close the lower jaw. This ability to open and close the jaw allows the bowfin to <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> predator, in that it can catch bigger prey and be able to mechanical catch, and digest it.|$|E

25|$|In 1890 {{the ability}} of an Attorney General to {{continue}} practising privately was formally taken away, turning the office-holder into a dedicated representative of the government. Since {{the beginning of the}} twentieth century the role of the Attorney General has moved away from representing the Crown and government directly in court, and it has <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> political and ministerial post, with the Attorney General serving as a legal adviser to both the government as a whole and individual government departments. Despite this change, until the passing of the Homicide Act 1957 the Attorney General was bound to prosecute any and all poisoning cases.|$|E
25|$|Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) {{have gained}} {{a lot of}} {{attention}} because they are much less susceptible to development of microbial resistance. Other antibiotics may be susceptible to bacterial resistance, like multi-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) which is known as a common relic in the healthcare industry while other bacterial strains have <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> concern for waste water treatment in local rivers or bays. AMPs can be functionalized onto a surface by either chemical or physical attachment. AMPs can be physically attached by using oppositely charged polymeric layers and sandwiching the polypeptide between them. This may be repeated to achieve multiple layers of AMPs for the recurring antibacterial activity. There are, however, a few drawbacks to this mechanism. Assembly thickness and polymer-peptide interactions can affect the diffusion of peptide to bacterial contact. Further research should be carried out to determine the effectiveness of the adsorption technique. However, they chemical attachment of AMPs is also widely studied.|$|E
500|$|Ned Flanders' {{religion}} was {{not mentioned in}} his first few appearances {{and in the first}} few seasons he was only mildly religious and his primary role was to be so [...] "cloyingly perfect as to annoy and shame the Simpsons", whereas Homer Simpson has always hated Ned Flanders and always tries to undermine him. There has been a consistent effort among the show's writers to make him not just [...] "goody good and an unsympathetic person". In the later seasons, Flanders has <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> caricature of the Christian right, and his role as an irritating [...] "perfect neighbor" [...] has been lessened. For example, some recent episodes Flanders has appeared to show rather prejudiced attitudes towards gays and people of religions other than Christianity.|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} with London's 95.8 Capital FM radio station, Gaga further elaborated on {{the changes in the}} show. She said that the show was constructed like a piece of musical theater. It also incorporated a number of contemporary and old musical pieces, some of them being re-recorded specifically for the show itself. A new keytar was constructed for the show and was named Emma. The instrument was created by the Haus of Gaga and the singer said, [...] "We have this new instrument that I brought to the Brits tonight, 'Emma', which is what I was playing on the stage. She's a hybrid from all these other instruments." [...] During {{an interview}} on KISS-FM with Ryan Seacrest, on his show On Air with Ryan Seacrest, Gaga explained that the concert tour was still called Monster Ball, but it had <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> musical and less of a concert. It had a New York theme at its core; telling a story where Gaga and her friends traveled to the Monster Ball, but got lost.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{consider}} Streltsov {{to be one}} of {{the finest}} footballers ever from Russia or the Soviet Union: British journalist and author Jonathan Wilson describes him as [...] "the greatest outfield player Russia has ever produced... a tall, powerful forward, possessed of a fine first touch and extraordinary footballing intelligence", while Russian author Aleksandr Nilin writes that [...] "the boy came to us from the land of wonder". Streltsov's skilful, innovative style of play helped him to stand out in Soviet football, and his pioneering of the back-heeled pass resulted in it becoming known in Russia as [...] "Streltsov's pass". During his early career, this technical ability combined with considerable speed and physical presence to create a formidable all-round forward player. In his later years, with his physical attributes reduced, he emphasised his skill and on-field intelligence to <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> playmaker, playing further back and setting up attacking moves for team-mates rather than leading them himself. Indeed, for his final two seasons, Streltsov played in an attacking midfield role rather than up front. Despite the eight-year gap between his two spells as a member of the Soviet national team, Streltsov, nicknamed [...] "The Russian Pelé", was the fourth highest international goalscorer in the country's history.|$|E

500|$|Milne {{was with}} Dundee United {{for a further}} three seasons and still a regular player in the team, {{although}} he scored less frequently. Milne's increasingly fractious relationship with manager Jim McLean was also becoming common knowledge; in December 1983 McLean publicly criticised Milne, stating [...] "I have {{tried to get the}} message across to him that it is when he is not playing well that he needs to work hardest. It is plainly not sinking in." [...] Ironically some months later in August 1984, it was Milne who scored both goals against Nottingham Forest in a pre-season testimonial match for McLean. However, after the game the pair again fell out because of a brief conversation Milne had with Brian Clough which led McLean to believe the player was trying to arrange a deal away from United; by this time Milne had grown increasingly frustrated over being frequently fined a week's wages for breaking minor club rules and generally offending McLean's strict sense of discipline. The financial strain this caused led to him to work as a casual labourer in order to meet his mortgage repayments. By this time his drinking had <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> problem, resulting in a struggle to maintain fitness.|$|E
500|$|His {{relationships}} with the other characters was described as appealing by IGN's Charles White and Jason Van Horn, most notably through his rivalry with Sasuke, as it shows [...] "signs of maturity" [...] in Naruto. However, his wish to retrieve Sasuke {{after the end of}} Part I was criticised because of his subsequent suffering. In a poll by Japanese pollster Charapedia, Naruto and Sasuke's rivalry reached the top place. Jacob Hope Chapman of ANN listed Naruto and Sasuke as one of [...] "Anime's Fiercest Frenemies" [...] considering their similarities and how they become friends after a mortal battle. Amy McNulty of ANN also praised their final fight, expressing amazement at how brutal some scenes were since Naruto had <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pacifist than previous story arcs. His romantic involvement with other characters led to disputes as there were fans in favour of his relationship with Sakura Haruno, while others preferred Hinata Hyuga. His romance with Hinata in the film The Last earned multiple positive reactions from the media. Some critics wished The Last could be condensed so that their relationship was the focus of the movie. On a similar note, both McNulty and Andy Hanley from UK Anime Network enjoyed Naruto's relationship with his son Boruto due to the differences in their childhoods and how that becomes the focus of the film Boruto.|$|E
500|$|Loup is a left-handed pitcher, or southpaw.

Now, as he pitches, he tracks a plane from his ear to his shoulder, which also helped his effectiveness against left-handed batters. His slider and fastball improved drastically, but his changeup continued to struggle, and Loup {{says that he is}} still a little inconsistent with it. He can throw a low-90s [...] "breaking" [...] fastball that is just as effective against right-handed batters as left-handed batters. John Farrell, a previous Toronto Blue Jays manager, said that it was [...] " [...] poise and his presence that allows him to maintain not only composure, but the ability to execute." [...] Blue Jays' bullpen coach Pat Hentgen says that Loup [...] "keeps things simple, he doesn't over-think. He stays aggressive. He's got a lot of guts, goes right after hitters and you combine all those things and you're going to have the success that he's had."

500|$|Kitchen Princess won the Kodansha Manga Award for children's manga in 2006. The {{series has}} {{received}} a range of reviews, from positive to lukewarm. Publishers Weekly enjoyed that Najika was not given a magical power and had to keep improving her cooking skills. Although the reviewer for School Library Journal described the series as [...] "a perfectly ordinary romance manga," [...] he praised Nunzio Defilippis and Christina Weir's adaptation of the manga. Deb Aoki of About.com listed the manga {{as one of the}} best shōjo series. Jason Thompson rated the series 3.5 out of 4 stars, describing it as [...] " [...] quick, delightful read." [...] Another reviewer for Publishers Weekly, Johanna Draper Carlsen, wrote that she found the manga reminiscent of the romantic comedy film Simply Irresistible (1999) and that the manga contained conventional shōjo aspects. In a later review of the second volume, she described the series as [...] "entertaining enough, but it’s fluffy and forgettable (like so many of the mousse items and drinks Najika makes). The volumes already feel familiar, even as I’m reading them for the first time." [...] Mania Entertainment's Sakura Eries expressed her lukewarm feelings towards the first volume, writing that the reader's suspension of disbelief was vital to enjoying the manga. She disliked the two-dimensional characterization and Ando's illustrations of the characters, although she felt that the food was well-drawn. Comparing the series to others in the cooking genre, she wrote that it differed in that [...] "cooking is Najika's expression of self and her means of creating relationships and drawing others to common ground (like the estranged Kitazawa Brothers)." [...] In follow-up reviews of the second and third volumes, she remained lukewarm to the series; she praised Kobayashi's portrayal of Akane's eating disorder, though she disliked how Najika's quest to find her flan prince seemed to <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> side-plot. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network praised Najika as a likeable protagonist and the characterizations as believable. He enjoyed the plot and recipes, although he wrote that the character designs lacked creativity, and criticized the plot clichés and the antagonists' weak characterization. He had mixed feelings about the fourth volume's emphasis on conventional shōjo romance and plot twists at the cost of its cooking aspect. He found the artwork conventional, though able to convey emotion. He wrote that the fifth volume finally balanced the romance and cooking elements, although he disliked the inclusion of a side story, preferring another chapter instead. In his review of the seventh volume, he concluded: [...] "this series takes the hoariest elements of the romance/drama/cooking genres and still manages to come up with something greater than the sum of its parts." ...|$|E
