40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{limitation}} {{in the use}} {{of synthetic}} pigments in food industries and aquaculture due to the related health issues {{is one of the main}} reasons to substitute natural pigments as food additives.

The promising method of purifying <b>red</b> <b>beet</b> juice from unwanted impurities is using carbon-bear-ing adsorbent- shungite, uniqueness {{of which can}} be explained by existence of fullerenes and nanotubes. The aim {{of this paper is to}} study how physico-chemical and organoleptic properties of <b>red</b> <b>beet</b> juice change when processed by shungite. Such study is done according to following methodolo-gy: previously thermo- activated shungite in quantity of 3. 23 - 9. 09 weight percents (% wt) is placed in juice at 50 0 С.

40|$|Nitrogen (N) {{tied up in}} or {{lost from}} decomposing biomass {{decreases}} the residual N effects of green manure and of other crop residues. During anaerobic degradation in a biogas digestor (biodigestion), N mineralization takes place under conditions in which losses can be kept to a minimum. Therefore, biodigestion of green manure biomass and beet foliage was tested to generate readily available N and compared with a direct green manure fertilization system. The effluent was applied as fertilizer in field experiments on a sandy soil {{as a tool for}} improving N supply for an organic farming system. Data from the field experiments were used for simulating the amount of net inorganic N equivalents (inorganic N equivalents from effluent plus inorganic N equivalents from pre-crops) in three crop sequences: A) green manure ley, <b>red</b> <b>beets,</b> winter rye; B) harvested ley, <b>red</b> <b>beets,</b> winter rye; and C) harvested ley, spring barley, <b>red</b> <b>beets</b> in which (B) and (C) represented biogas nutrient management systems and (A) a green manure system. When all available effluent from biogas production from 1 ha of grass–clover ley with two or three harvests (2 H-ley or 3 H-ley) and one hectare of beet foliage was used as a fertilizer for <b>red</b> <b>beets</b> (Beta vulgaris var. conditiva Alef) after barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), the yield of marketable <b>red</b> <b>beets</b> increased by 5. 7 Mg·ha– 1 (33 %) with effluent from 2 H-ley and beet foliage and 9. 1 Mg·ha– 1 (53 %) with effluent from 3 H-ley and beet foliage compared with <b>red</b> <b>beets</b> grown without effluent fertilization after a green manure ley. When total dry matter production was taken into account, the advantage for the BG systems with 2 H- and 3 H-ley was 15 % and 28 %, respectively. The nitrate concentration in the <b>red</b> <b>beets</b> was not higher with effluent supplied at this level than with green manure as the only N source. The simulated amount of net inorganic N equivalents was 128 kg N for the whole of crop sequence (C) with 1 ha of each crop and where effluent supply to <b>red</b> <b>beets</b> was based on digested biomass in ley and beet tops. The corresponding amount of net inorganic N equivalents for the green manure crop sequence (A), in which no effluent was supplied, was 73 kg N. Unused soil mineral N (0 - to 90 -cm depth) at <b>red</b> <b>beet</b> harvest indicated that the risk of leaching in BG systems was lower than in GrM systems (88, 76, and 61 kg Nmin/ha left after unmanured beets after Gr-M-ley, low manured beets after 3 H-ley and high manured beets after barley, respectively). Effluent fertilization of <b>red</b> <b>beets</b> directly after 2 H- and 3 H-ley gave unexpectedly low yield responses compared with <b>red</b> <b>beets</b> after barley. The reasons {{may be the result of}} nutritional imbalance of other nutrients than N or may be plant pathological in nature. The conclusion is that a nutrient management system with biodigestion can increase net inorganic N equivalents and reduce risk for N leaching, but inappropriate use of the effluent, i. e., at an unsuitable point in the crop rotation, may negate the benefits...|$|R

In this research, spray dryer was operated at 150 °C inlet temperature and 90 °C outlet temperature. Gum arabic, and maltodextrin 10 DE were added as microencapsulating agents. There were 2 different treatments for each microencapsulating agent which are A (40 % CA) and B (60 % CA). Then the <b>red</b> <b>beet</b> powder was chemically and physically analyzed.

40|$|Abstract. The {{dynamics}} of the lactic acid fermentation of different vegetable juices inoculated with Lactobacillus acidophilus- that are not constitutive from the epiphytic microbiota of vegetables-were evaluated through some physical and chemical parameters: pH and titratable acidity, expressed in lactic acid. Because the stability and {{the preservation of the}} lacto-fermented juices are important from the technological point of view, the evolution of those ones should be monitored. In this sense, this work targets to find prediction models and curve fittings that express the pH and lactic acid dynamics during lactic acid fermentation of various juices with Lactobacillus acidophilus. With a view to obtain probiotic products, all the vegetable juices (obtained from carrots, <b>red</b> <b>beet,</b> white and <b>red</b> cabbage) were suitable for lactic acid fermentation. Excepting the <b>red</b> <b>beet</b> fermented juice, the others become highly stable after 24 hours, the pH values being 3. 74 - 3. 84, while the lactic acid content was comprised between 6. 3 and 8. 01 g/l.
