5|$|Where {{payments}} have <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> mistake claimants {{may or may}} not be able {{to recoup}} their losses. The leading case is Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC, where Lord Browne-Wilkinson declared that a constructive trust would be created when the recipient of the funds became aware of the mistaken transfer. As such, ignorance of the mistake would not create a fiduciary relationship, therefore not a trust, and the property would be untraceable.|$|E
