25|$|The {{second volume}} of his memoirs {{provides}} {{insight into the}} general atmosphere {{at the time of}} the Terror, as felt by an aristocratic royalist, who was at risk of being arrested at any moment and finishing up on the scaffold, and yet forced to travel <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> territory of the brand new French Republic.|$|E
25|$|Alternating {{layers of}} shallow marine and non-marine sediments were {{deposited}} as the shoreline fluctuated <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> area. These sediments became the locally 650 to 750foot (200 to 230m) thick Masuk Member. The Masuk consists of cliff-forming cross-bedded sandstones and slope-forming yellowish-gray to bluish-gray mudstones with interbedded light gray sandstones. Fossils of bivalves, ceratopsian dinosaurs, crocodiles, gastropods, and turtles {{have been collected}} in this member.|$|E
25|$|Salvage divers from Halliburton first {{detached}} the bow {{from the}} rest of the vessel because it may have contained unexploded torpedo warheads and because it could break off and destabilise the lifting. The divers installed two large hydraulic suction anchors into the seabed and attached a high-strength tungsten carbide abrasive saw that was pulled <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> bow between the anchors. It took ten days to detach the bow.|$|E

25|$|Webspinners {{continually}} {{extend their}} galleries into new food sources, and expand their existing galleries {{as they grow}} in size. The insects spin silk by moving their forelegs <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> substrate, and rotating their bodies to create a cylindrical, silk-lined tunnel. Older galleries have multiple laminate layers of silk. Each gallery complex contains a number of individuals, often descended from a single female, and forms a complex maze-like structure, extending from a secure retreat into whatever vegetable food matter is available nearby. The size {{and complexity of the}} colony varies between species, and they can be very extensive in those species that live in hot and humid climates.|$|E
500|$|In 1924 J. Jovanović {{went public}} stating that his warning {{had been made}} on his own initiative, {{and what he said}} was that [...] "Among the Serb youths (in the army) there may be one who will put a ball-cartridge in his rifle or {{revolver}} in place of a blank cartridge and he may fire it, the bullet might strike the man giving provocation (Franz Ferdinand)." [...] J. Jovanović's account changed <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years and never adequately addressed Colonel Lesanin's statement. [...] Bilinski did not speak openly on the subject, but his press department chief confirmed that a meeting had taken place including a vague warning, but {{there was no mention of}} an ethnic Serb Austro-Hungarian soldier shooting Franz Ferdinand.|$|E
500|$|To {{show the}} side effects Focusyn had on Bart, the animators made slight changes to his face as the episode progressed. It is first seen in the scene where Bart is reading [...] "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Pre-teens": a cheek line is added just under his eyes {{to suggest that he}} is {{starting}} to change. In another scene, Bart can be seen speed reading and later on, the animators drew him with [...] "mini-pupils". The staff discussed whether Bart's pupils would be bigger or smaller than normal while he is on the drug. The writers settled on smaller pupils and, according to Kirkland, [...] "several model sheets were going <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> fax machines" [...] until the staff were satisfied with the size of Bart's pupils while influenced by the drug. In fact, psychostimulants used to treat ADHD are more likely cause pupils to become bigger (dilated).|$|E

2500|$|Bread making {{began with}} the milling of the grain. It was a {{difficult}} and time-consuming task, performed by women. Each household stored its own grain, and {{it is estimated that}} it required at least three hours of daily effort to produce enough flour to make sufficient bread for a family of five. The earliest milling was performed with a pestle and mortar, or a stone quern consisting of a large lower stone that held the grain and a smooth upper stone that was moved <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> grains (...) [...] This often left small pieces of grit in the flour. The use of the millstone became more widespread during the Iron Age, resulting in greater speed and increased production of flour. Smaller versions for household use, the rotary or beehive quern, appeared during the early Persian period.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2008, on DJ Cisco's Urban Legend mixtape, Ice-T criticized DeAndre Cortez [...] "Soulja Boy Tell 'Em" [...] Way for [...] "killing hip hop" [...] and {{his song}} [...] "Crank That" [...] for being [...] "garbage" [...] {{compared}} to the works of other hip-hop artists such as Rakim, Das EFX, Big Daddy Kane and Ice Cube. One of the comments in the exchange was when Ice-T told Way to [...] "eat a dick". The two then traded numerous videos <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Internet. These videos included a cartoon and video of Ice-T dancing on Way's behalf and an apology, but reiteration of his feelings that Way's music [...] "sucks", on Ice-T's behalf. Rapper Kanye West defended Way saying [...] "He came from the 'hood, made his own beats, made up a new saying, new sound and a new dance with one song." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the final}} video {{interlude}} [...] "Illuminati", {{seven of the}} dancers climbed twenty foot poles and began swaying <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> audience seated on the floor. The singer returned to the stage in a 1920s flapper-inspired dress to perform a mashup of [...] "Music" [...] and [...] "Candy Shop". A slowed down version of [...] "Material Girl" [...] found Madonna pushing her tuxedo clad dancers down an incline and played the ukulele once again during a cover of [...] "La Vie en rose" [...] alone on stage. On selected shows, Madonna also performed a snippet of [...] "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend". During [...] "Unapologetic Bitch", Madonna invited someone from the audience, terming {{the person with the}} titular name, and gifting a banana. The show ended with [...] "Holiday", where Madonna came out wrapped in the flag of the country she performed in, while energetically dancing around the stage as confetti dropped from the ceiling. At the end of the performance, she was strapped into a harness and flew above the stage, before disappearing behind the video screens.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the afternoon, Confederate {{engineers}} {{scrambled to}} create a new defensive line 500 yards further south {{at the base of the}} Mule Shoe, while fighting at the Bloody Angle continued day and night with neither side achieving an advantage, until around 12:00 AM on May 13, the fighting finally stopped. At 4 A.M., the exhausted Confederate infantrymen were notified that the new line was ready and they withdrew from the original earthworks unit by unit. The combat they had endured for almost 24 hours was characterized by an intensity of firepower never previously seen in Civil War battles, as the entire landscape was flattened, all the foliage destroyed. An example of this can be found in the Smithsonian Museum of American History: a 22-inch stump of an oak tree at the Bloody Angle that was completely severed by rifle fire. There was a frenzy to the carnage on both sides. Fighting <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> same corpse-strewn trenches for hours on end, using single shot muskets, the contending troops were periodically reduced to hand-to-hand combat reminiscent of battles fought during ancient times. Bodies piled up four and five high, and soldiers were forced to pause from time to time and throw corpses over the parapet since they formed an obstacle in the way of the fighting. Dead and wounded men were shot so many times that many of them simply fell apart into unrecognizable heaps of flesh. Surviving participants attempted to describe in letters, diaries, and memoirs the hellish intensity of that day, many noting that it was beyond words. Or, as one put it: [...] "Nothing can describe the confusion, the savage, blood-curdling yells, the murderous faces, the awful curses, and the grisly horror of the melee." [...] Some men claimed to have fired as many as 400 rounds that day. May 12 was the most intensive day of fighting during the battle, with Union casualties of about 9,000, Confederate 8,000; the Confederate loss includes about 3,000 prisoners captured in the Mule Shoe.|$|E

60|$|Hereupon, Periwinkle, Clover, Sweet Fern, and as {{many others}} of the little {{fraternity}} and cousinhood as were still at Tanglewood, gathered about Eustace, and earnestly besought him for a story. The student yawned, stretched himself, and then, to the vast admiration of the small people, skipped three times <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> top of a chair, in order, as he explained to them, to set his wits in motion.|$|E
60|$|It was Dave {{who found}} himself the first attacked. A tall Iroquois, {{straight}} as an arrow, leaped upon him {{and tried to}} stab him with a hunting knife. The young soldier warded off the blow, with his gun, and in a trice the pair were locked in each other's arms and swaying <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> rocks. The Indian muttered something between his set teeth, but Dave did not understand what was said.|$|E

60|$|<b>Back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Green Meadows sailed Whitetail the Marsh Hawk. Like Longlegs the Blue Heron, he was hungry. His sharp eyes {{peered down}} among the grasses, looking for {{something}} to eat, but some good fairy seemed to have warned the very little people who live there that Whitetail was out hunting. Perhaps it was one of Old Mother West Wind's children, the Merry Little Breezes. You know they are always flitting about trying to do some one a good turn.|$|E
60|$|Then Johnny Chuck {{took them}} over {{to the edge of the}} old orchard, where they could peep out over the Green Meadows. He pointed out old Whitetail the Marshhawk, sailing <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> meadows, and told them how once, when he was a little Chuck and had run away from home, old Whitetail had nearly caught him. He told them about Farmer Brown's boy and about Bowser the Hound and a great many other things that little Chucks should learn about.|$|E
