60|$|The {{shoemaker}} did jump up, and {{we helped}} him move the bench, {{and had the}} trap-door open in no time. By this, {{the rest of the}} party had come back, and when Mrs. Chipperton saw the well open and no Mr. Chipperton about, she turned as white as a sheet. We could hardly wait for the man to light his lamp, {{and as soon as he}} started down the winding stairs, Rectus and I followed him. I called back to Mrs. Chipperton and the others that they need not come; we would <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> and let them know. But it was of no use; they all came. We hurried on after the man with the light, and passed straight ahead through the narrow passage to the very end of it.|$|E

[...] "She didn't seem to know who they were at first, and when I made her understand she hung back, and said, 'Those showy things?' and I must say I think she was wrong; they were dressed as quietly as nine-tenths of the people there; only they are rather large, handsome women. I said I thought we ought to go and speak to them, they seemed stranded there; but she didn't seem to see it; and, when I persisted, she said, 'Well, you go if you think best; but take me to mamma.' And I supposed it was all right; and I told Mrs. Pasmer I'd <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> and then I went off to those women. And after I'd talked with them a while I saw Mrs. Brinkley sitting with old Bromfield Corey in another corner, and I got them across and introduced them; after I'd explained to Mrs. Brinkley who they were; and they began to have a good time, and I--didn't." ...|$|E

6000|$|Now, it {{cannot be}} maintained, even, {{that by the}} {{crawling}} system {{the greatest amount of}} truth would be attained in any long series of ages, for the repression of imagination was an evil not to be compensated for by any superior certainty in the ancient modes of investigation. The error of these Jurmains, these Vrinch, these Inglitch, and these Amriccans (the latter, by the way, were our own immediate progenitors), was an error quite analogous with that of the wiseacre who fancies that he must necessarily see an object the better the more closely he holds it to his eyes. These people blinded themselves by details. When they proceeded Hoggishly, their [...] "facts" [...] were by no means always facts--a matter of little consequence {{had it not been for}} assuming that they were facts and must be facts because they appeared to be such. When they proceeded on the path of the Ram, their course was scarcely as straight as a ram's horn, for they never had an axiom which was an axiom at all. They must have been very blind not to see this, even in their own day; for even in their own day many of the long [...] "established" [...] axioms had been rejected. For example--"Ex nihilo nihil fit"; [...] "a body cannot act where it is not"; [...] "there cannot exist antipodes"; [...] "darkness cannot come out of light"--all these, and a dozen other similar propositions, formerly admitted without hesitation as axioms, were, even at the period of which I speak, seen to be untenable. How absurd in these people, then, to persist in putting faith in [...] "axioms" [...] as immutable bases of Truth! But even out of the mouths of their soundest reasoners it is easy to demonstrate the futility, the impalpability of their axioms in general. Who was the soundest of their logicians? Let me see! I will go and ask Pundit and <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute....</b> Ah, here we have it! Here is a book written nearly a thousand years ago and lately translated from the Inglitch--which, by the way, appears to have been the rudiment of the Amriccan. Pundit says it is decidedly the cleverest ancient work on its topic, Logic. The author (who was much thought of in his day) was one Miller, or Mill; and we find it recorded of him, as a point of some importance, that he had a mill-horse called Bentham. But let us glance at the treatise! ...|$|E
