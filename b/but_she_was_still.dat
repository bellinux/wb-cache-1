Lanying Lin studied very hard at this primary school and often got the best grade in the class. <b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> required to do all the washing and cooking. As soon as she went back home, she started doing housework. At night, after finishing all her housework, she finally began studying and slept after 12 a.m. every day. And at six in the morning, she got up to cook and then went to school. At the age of six, she could only sleep six hours a day and this continued for her whole life.|$|E

500|$|On 14 May 1904, the battleships Hatsuse, , and Yashima, the {{protected}} cruiser Kasagi, and the dispatch boat [...] put to sea {{to relieve the}} Japanese blockading force off Port Arthur. The following morning, the squadron encountered a Russian minefield. Hatsuse struck one mine that disabled her steering and Yashima struck two others when moving to assist Hatsuse. Yashima was towed away from the minefield, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> taking on water at an uncontrollable rate and the crew abandoned ship some five hours later. Kasagi took Yashima in tow, but the battleship's list continued to increase and she capsized about three hours later.|$|E
500|$|Exeter {{was hit by}} a {{total of}} seven 283mm shells that killed 61 of her crew and wounded another 23. After all Exeters guns had been put out of action <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> seaworthy, Bell planned to collide with the enemy, saying [...] "I'm going to ram the --------. It will be the end of us but it will sink him too". In return the ship had hit Admiral Graf Spee three times; one shell {{penetrated}} her main armour belt and narrowly missed detonating in one of her engine rooms, but the most important one disabled her oil-purification equipment. Without it, the ship was unlikely to be able to reach Germany. Several days later, unable to be repaired and apparently confronted by powerful Royal Navy reinforcements, Admiral Graf Spee was scuttled in Montevideo harbour.|$|E

500|$|SMS Basilisk was a [...] of the Prussian Navy (later the Imperial German Navy) {{that was}} {{launched}} in 1862. A small vessel, armed with only three light guns, Basilisk served during all three wars of German unification in the 1860s and early 1870s. The ship was present during the Battle of Heligoland in May 1864 during the Second Schleswig War, but was too slow to engage the Danish squadron. During the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and the Franco-Prussian War of 18701871, Basilisk was stationed in the North Sea to help defend the coast, {{but she did not}} see action during either conflict. Between 1873 and 1875, she was employed experimentally as the first torpedo-armed warship of the German fleet. Basilisk was decommissioned in 1875, renamed [...] "Mine Barge No. 1", and converted into a naval mine storage hulk. The details of her fate are unrecorded, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> in service in that capacity at least as late as 1900. Sometime thereafter, she was broken up.|$|E
500|$|The ship ran aground near Newport, Rhode Island in September 1896. Operator error {{combined}} with signal failure were blamed. A few officers, including future Governor of Guam Alfred Walton Hinds, were publicly reprimanded. While under repairs in New York, the yoke that secured the main injection valve in the starboard engine room broke on 9 November 1896. Water pressure unseated the valve {{and allowed the}} compartment to flood as the receiving pipe had earlier been removed for repair. Leaks in the watertight doors, voicepipes and holes in the bulkheads for electrical cables allowed the flooding to spread to the other engine and boiler rooms, the coal bunkers adjacent to them, {{as well as most}} of the magazines and shell rooms. The ship settled to the bottom, but the water was so shallow as to aid salvage efforts. By the 11th most of the water had been pumped out, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> drawing too much water to enter the drydock. An estimated [...] of coal would have to be removed to lighten Texas enough to enter the drydock.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{her initial}} dislike of the sport, she entered her first {{mountain}} bike race in February 1989 in an intermediate-level category and had lap times {{comparable to the}} winner of the women's expert category. She entered the next race in the expert category—the second round of the National Championship Series held on Christchurch's Port Hills—and came second. Lynch then borrowed a quality mountain bike and won the third race of the national series that was held in Queenstown with an impressive 11-minute margin. This saw her secure a sponsorship deal with Gary Fisher Mountain Bikes, then {{regarded as one of the}} best brands of mountain bike available. Her next race was the longer-distance Karapoti Classic, the fourth time that the race was held, and the fourth race of the national series. Helped by excellent conditions, Lynch took 38 minutes off the course record (set the previous year) and beat the previous year's winner by eight minutes. Lynch entered the last race of the national series as the clear favourite. The conditions in Riverhead, near Auckland, were [...] "atrocious". Lynch had never raced in mud before and her time was 79 minutes slower than the winning elite man (compared to 37 minutes at the Karapoti Classic), <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> 52 minutes ahead of the second-placed woman. In her first year of competitive mountain bike racing, Lynch had won the New Zealand championship.|$|E

2500|$|Another major {{character}} {{introduced in}} the later years was Assistant District attorney Draper Scott (Tony Craig), who started out working alongside Brandy Henderson and tried to date her <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> in love with Adam Drake. Draper prosecuted Nicole's cousin Serena Faraday (Louise Shaffer) {{for the murder of}} her ex-husband Mark Faraday (Bernie McInery) but Adam defended her and proved it was her alternate personality [...] "Josie" [...] and she was sent to a mental institution. Draper left the D. A. office and joined forces with Mike Karr after Adam Drake was shot and killed. He eventually married April Cavanaugh (Terri Davis) sister of Dr. Miles Cavanaugh. One of the later major story arcs was about a train wreck where Draper had been unjustly convicted of murder, escaping from the train accident. [...] There was also a storyline in the mid-1970s involving a troubled woman (Nicole's cousin, Serena Faraday) who changed her personality to Josie as she donned a frizzy, black wig in perhaps a nod to One Life to Lives popular Victoria Lord/Niki Smith storyline. [...] Another notable character was Charlotte [...] "Raven" [...] Alexander Jamison Swift Whitney (Juanin Clay, then Sharon Gabet), a duplicitous coquette who became more stable and faithful in the latter years.|$|E
2500|$|By Saturday, the {{infection}} had died down, and she flew to Kona.

[...] The flight had caused her leg to swell up again, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> able to do some bike and run training.

She later wote, [...] "I was 'crying into my goggles', and described the pain as 'unbearable'", adding, [...] "I was convinced I'd broken my rib. Every breath hurt and I couldn't move my arm properly." [...] The previous day Mike Leahy had begun treating Wellington using his Active Release Therapy (ART); he instructed her {{to go to the hospital}} for tests, not wanting to continue ART treatment if the problem was a fracture. The hospital's first concern, from the swollen state of her leg, was that she might have a pulmonary embolism. Six hours of tests showed that she had no fractures, nor any embolism, but that she did have damaged pectoral and intercostal muscles; the badly infected state of her leg was obvious from the appalling smell when the bandages were removed.|$|E
