This gas forces the valve to stay sealed {{and allows the}} gun to be cocked which prepares the hammer of the paintball marker for firing. Without {{the pressure of the}} gas in the valve the gun cannot be cocked. As indicated by the term pump action the first step in firing the marker is the pump stroke which uses the rod connecting the pump handle and bolt to cock the marker. The pump stroke consists of two parts; the <b>backward</b> <b>pump</b> stroke and the forward pump stroke. On the <b>backward</b> <b>pump</b> stroke the bolt moves back, compressing the main spring until the bolt and hammer are connected by the sear. At this time a single ball drops into the breech. Next, during the forward pump stroke, both the bolt and hammer move forward, chambering the paintball sealing the breech. Next, as the trigger is pulled, the sear pivots and releases the hammer from the bolt. The compressed main spring forces the hammer back until it reaches the rear of the power tube and provides enough energy to force the power tube back. As the power tube is pushed back the valve opens and compressed gas flows through the power tube and the tuned port compensator (TPC), projecting the paintball out of the barrel.|$|E

In this paper, we have critically analyzed by simulation the noise figure of Distributed fibre Raman amplifiers for different pumping schemes. The main sources of optical noise and their effects on the noise figure and optical signal to noise ratio are also discussed.
