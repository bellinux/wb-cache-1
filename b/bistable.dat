5|$|Neuroscientist and {{psychologist}} Pascal Wallisch {{states that}} while inherently ambiguous stimuli {{have been known}} to vision science for many years, this is the first such stimulus in the colour domain that was {{brought to the attention of}} science by social media. He attributes differential perceptions to differences in illumination and fabric priors, but also notes that the stimulus is highly unusual insofar as the perception of most people does not switch. If it does, it does so only on very long time scales, which is highly unusual for <b>bistable</b> stimuli, so perceptual learning might be at play. In addition, he says that discussions of this stimulus are not frivolous, as the stimulus is both of interest to science and a paradigmatic case of how different people can sincerely see the world differently, an acknowledgement of which is a precondition for world peace. Daniel Hardiman-McCartney of the College of Optometrists stated that the picture was ambiguous, suggesting that the illusion was caused by a strong yellow light shining onto the dress, and human perception of the colours of the dress and light source by comparing them with other colours and objects in the picture. The philosopher Barry C. Smith compared the phenomenon with Ludwig Wittgenstein and the rabbit–duck illusion.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 {{researchers}} at the University of Oxford demonstrated two new types of zero-power <b>bistable</b> LCDs based on Zenithal <b>bistable</b> techniques. Several <b>bistable</b> technologies, like the 360° BTN and the <b>bistable</b> cholesteric, depend mainly on the bulk properties of the liquid crystal (LC) and use standard strong anchoring, with alignment films and LC mixtures similar to the traditional monostable materials. Other <b>bistable</b> technologies, e.g. BiNem technology, are based mainly on the surface properties and need specific weak anchoring materials.|$|E
25|$|A {{comparator}} {{can be used}} {{to build}} a relaxation oscillator. It uses both positive and negative feedback. The positive feedback is a Schmitt trigger configuration. Alone, the trigger is a <b>bistable</b> multivibrator. However, the slow negative feedback added to the trigger by the RC circuit causes the circuit to oscillate automatically. That is, the addition of the RC circuit turns the hysteretic <b>bistable</b> multivibrator into an astable multivibrator.|$|E
25|$|These have {{a region}} of {{operation}} showing negative resistance caused by quantum tunneling, allowing amplification of signals and very simple <b>bistable</b> circuits. Because of the high carrier concentration, tunnel diodes are very fast, may be used at low (mK) temperatures, high magnetic fields, and in high radiation environments. Because of these properties, they are often used in spacecraft.|$|E
25|$|Chromosomal regions can adopt {{stable and}} {{heritable}} alternative states resulting in <b>bistable</b> gene expression without {{changes to the}} DNA sequence. Epigenetic control {{is often associated with}} alternative covalent modifications of histones. The stability and heritability of states of larger chromosomal regions are suggested to involve positive feedback where modified nucleosomes recruit enzymes that similarly modify nearby nucleosomes. A simplified stochastic model for this type of epigenetics is found here.|$|E
25|$|By {{use of a}} {{permanent}} magnet in the magnetic circuit, a relay {{can be made to}} respond to current in one direction differently from in another. Such polarized relays are used on direct-current circuits to detect, for example, reverse current into a generator. These relays can be made <b>bistable,</b> maintaining a contact closed with no coil current and requiring reverse current to reset. For AC circuits, the principle is extended with a polarizing winding connected to a reference voltage source.|$|E
25|$|A {{thyristor}} is a solid-state {{semiconductor device}} with four layers of alternating P and N-type materials. It acts exclusively as a <b>bistable</b> switch, conducting when the gate receives a current trigger, {{and continuing to}} conduct while the voltage across the device is not reversed (forward-biased). A three-lead thyristor is designed to control the larger current of its two leads by combining that current with the smaller current of its other lead, known as its control lead. In contrast, a two-lead thyristor is designed to switch on if the potential difference between its leads is sufficiently large (breakdown voltage).|$|E
25|$|Positive {{feedback}} {{occurs when}} the fed-back signal is in phase with the input signal. Under certain gain conditions, positive feedback reinforces the input signal {{to the point where}} the output of the device oscillates between its maximum and minimum possible states. Positive feedback may also introduce hysteresis into a circuit. This can cause the circuit to ignore small signals and respond only to large ones. It is sometimes used to eliminate noise from a digital signal. Under some circumstances, positive feedback may cause a device to latch, i.e., to reach a condition in which the output is locked to its maximum or minimum state. This fact is very widely used in digital electronics to make <b>bistable</b> circuits for volatile storage of information.|$|E
25|$|These curves {{indicate}} that a spin transition has occurred in a metal complex as temperature changed. The gradual transition curve {{is an indication that}} not all metal centers within the complex are undergoing the transition at the same temperature. The abrupt spin change with hysteresis indicates a strong cooperativity, or “communication”, between neighboring metal complexes. In the latter case, the material is <b>bistable</b> and can exist in the two different spin states with a different range of external stimuli (temperature in this case) for the two phenomena, namely LS → HS and HS → LS. The two-step transition is relatively rare but is observed, for example, with dinuclear SCO complexes for which the spin transition in one metal center renders the transition in the second metal center less favorable.|$|E
500|$|Dynamic {{surfaces}} {{have been}} reported that undergo changes in surface energy upon the application of an appropriate stimuli. [...] For example, a surface presenting photon-driven molecular motors was shown to undergo changes in water contact angle when switched between <b>bistable</b> conformations of differing surface energies.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} studies have shown that {{activity}} in primary sensory areas of the brain is not sufficient to produce consciousness: [...] it is possible for subjects to report a lack of awareness even when areas such as the primary visual cortex show clear electrical responses to a stimulus. [...] Higher brain areas are seen as more promising, especially the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in a range of higher cognitive functions collectively known as executive functions. [...] There is substantial evidence that a [...] "top-down" [...] flow of neural activity (i.e., activity propagating from the frontal cortex to sensory areas) is more predictive of conscious awareness than a [...] "bottom-up" [...] flow of activity. [...] The prefrontal cortex is not the only candidate area, however: [...] studies by Nikos Logothetis and his colleagues have shown, for example, that visually responsive neurons in parts of the temporal lobe reflect the visual perception in the situation when conflicting visual images are presented to different eyes (i.e., <b>bistable</b> percepts during binocular rivalry).|$|E

2500|$|<b>Bistable</b> LCDs do {{not require}} {{continuous}} refreshing. Rewriting is only required for picture information changes. In 1984 HA van Sprang and AJSM de Vaan invented an STN type display that could be operated in a <b>bistable</b> mode, enabling extreme high resolution images up to 4000 lines or more using only low voltages. Since a pixel however may be either in an on-state or in an off state at the moment new information needs to be written to that particular pixel, the addressing method of these <b>bistable</b> displays is rather complex, reason why these displays did not {{made it to the}} market. That changed when in the 2010 [...] "zero-power" [...] (<b>bistable)</b> LCDs became available. Potentially, passive-matrix addressing can be used with devices if their write/erase characteristics are suitable, which was the case for ebooks showing still pictures only. After a page is written to the display, the display may be cut from the power while that information remains readable. This has the advantage that such ebooks may be operated long time on just a small battery only. High-resolution color displays, such as modern LCD computer monitors and televisions, use an active-matrix structure. A matrix of thin-film transistors (TFTs) is added to the electrodes in contact with the LC layer. Each pixel has its own dedicated transistor, allowing each column line to access one pixel. When a row line is selected, all of the column lines are connected to a row of pixels and voltages corresponding to the picture information are driven onto all of the column lines. The row line is then deactivated and the next row line is selected. All of the row lines are selected in sequence during a refresh operation. Active-matrix addressed displays look brighter and sharper than passive-matrix addressed displays of the same size, and generally have quicker response times, producing much better images.|$|E
2500|$|A well-detailed {{example of}} the first {{procedure}} is described in reference [...] It is also possible to realize avalanche mode <b>bistable</b> multivibrators, but their use is not as common as other types described of multivibrators, one important reason being that they require two avalanche transistors, one working continuously in avalanche breakdown regime, and this can give serious problems {{from the point of}} wiev of power dissipation and device operating life.|$|E
2500|$|In 1937-1938, Tolnai {{had several}} {{temporary}} assignments {{for the army}} administration in Sweden, which exploited his patents for, among others, including driving relay, an electrically operated switch, which then became part of his construction of the Central Instrument (key instrument). Many relays use an electromagnet to operate a switching mechanism mechanically, but other operating principles are also used. The structure is used to measure one or more physical quantities. In terms of the basic physical tasks required, a driver {{must be able to}} control direction, acceleration, and deceleration. A latching relay has two relaxed states (<b>bistable).</b> These are also called [...] "impulse", [...] "keep", or [...] "stay" [...] relays.|$|E
2500|$|The zenithal <b>bistable</b> device (ZBD), {{developed}} by QinetiQ (formerly DERA), can retain an image without power. The crystals may exist {{in one of}} two stable orientations ("black" [...] and [...] "white") and power is only required to change the image. ZBD Displays is a spin-off company from QinetiQ who manufactured both grayscale and color ZBD devices. Kent Displays has also developed a [...] "no-power" [...] display that uses polymer stabilized cholesteric liquid crystal (ChLCD). In 2009 Kent demonstrated the use of a ChLCD to cover the entire surface of a mobile phone, allowing it to change colors, and keep that color even when power is cut off.|$|E
2500|$|An illustrative {{example is}} a <b>bistable</b> system that can be {{characterized}} by a hidden Markov model (HMM) subject to measurement noise (Figure 2). Such models are employed for many biological systems: they have for example been used in development, cell signaling, activation/deactivation, logical processing and non-equilibrium thermodynamics. For instance, {{the behavior of the}} Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) transcription factor in Drosophila melanogaster can be modeled with a HMM. The (biological) dynamical model consists of two states: A and B. If the probability of a transition from one state to the other is defined as [...] in both directions, the probability to remain in the same state at each time step is 1-. The probability to measure the state correctly is [...] (conversely, the probability of an incorrect measurement is 1-).|$|E
2500|$|An area {{of active}} {{research}} on microbial cellulose {{is in the}} area of electronic paper. [...] Currently, plant cellulose is used to produce the bulk of traditional paper, but due to its low purity it must be mixed with other substances such as lignin. [...] However, due to microbial cellulose's higher purity and microfibril structure, it may prove to be an excellent candidate for an electronic paper substrate. [...] Microbial cellulose can be fashioned into sheets approximately 100 micrometers thick, about the thickness of normal paper, by a wet synthesis process. [...] The microbial cellulose produces a sturdy substrate with a microfibril structure that allows the paper to be implanted with dopants. [...] Through the application of solutions to the microbial cellulose paper, conductive dopants and electrochromic dyes can be placed into the microfibril structure. [...] The <b>bistable</b> dyes change from clear to dark upon the application of the appropriate voltages, which when placed in a pixel structure, would allow images to be formed. [...] This technology is still in the research stage and has not yet been scaled to commercial production levels. [...] Further research has been done to apply bacterial cellulose as a substrate in electronic devices with the potential to be used as e-book tablets, e-newspapers, dynamic wall papers, rewritable maps and learning tools. Another possible example of bacterial cellulose use in the electronics industry includes the manufacture of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).|$|E
2500|$|In the 1990s {{another type}} of {{electronic}} ink based on a microencapsulated electrophoretic display was conceived and prototyped {{by a team of}} undergraduates at MIT as described in their Nature paper. [...] J.D. Albert, Barrett Comiskey, Joseph Jacobson, Jeremy Rubin and Russ Wilcox co-founded E Ink Corporation in 1997 to commercialize the technology. E ink subsequently formed a partnership with Philips Components two years later to develop and market the technology. In 2005, Philips sold the electronic paper business as well as its related patents to Prime View International. [...] “It has for many years been an ambition of researchers in display media to create a flexible low-cost system that is the electronic analogue of paper. In this context, microparticle-based displays have long intrigued researchers. Switchable contrast in such displays is achieved by the electromigration of highly scattering or absorbing microparticles (in the size range 0.1–5 mm), quite distinct from the [...] molecular-scale properties that govern the behaviour of the more familiar liquid-crystal displays. Micro-particle-based displays possess intrinsic bistability, exhibit extremely low power d.c. field addressing and have demonstrated high contrast and reflectivity. These features, combined with a near-lambertian viewing characteristic, result in an ‘ink on paper’ look. But such displays have to date suffered from short lifetimes and difficulty in manufacture. Here we report the synthesis of an electrophoretic ink based on the microencapsulation of an electrophoretic dispersion. The use of a microencapsulated electrophoretic medium solves the lifetime issues and permits the fabrication of a <b>bistable</b> electronic display solely by means of printing. This system may satisfy the practical requirements of electronic paper.” ...|$|E

50|$|The {{firing of}} an action potential, and {{consequently}} the release of neurotransmitters, occurs by this gating mechanism. In synaptic gating, in order for an action potential to occur, there must {{be more than one}} input to produce a single output in the neuron being gated. The interaction between these sets of neurons creates a biological AND gate. The neuron being gated is <b>bistable</b> and must be brought to the up state before it can fire an action potential. When this <b>bistable</b> neuron is in the up state, the gate is open. A gatekeeper neuron is responsible for stimulating the <b>bistable</b> neuron by shifting it from a down state to an up state and thus, opening the gate. Once the gate is open, an excitatory neuron can cause the <b>bistable</b> neuron to further depolarize and reach threshold causing and action potential to occur. If the gatekeeper does not shift the <b>bistable</b> neuron from down to up, the excitatory neuron {{will not be able to}} fire an action potential in the <b>bistable</b> neuron. Both the gatekeeper neuron and excitatory neuron are necessary to fire an action potential in the <b>bistable</b> neuron, but neither is sufficient to do so alone.|$|E
50|$|Current {{research}} now has {{shed light}} {{on the fact that the}} bistability of a neuron may be part of a larger <b>bistable</b> neural network. Evidence of a <b>bistable</b> network has been shown with the interneurons of the auditory cortex. The stable states of this auditory cortex network are either synchronous or antisynchronous, which illustrates its <b>bistable</b> nature. When auditory interneurons were coupled with electrical and chemical inhibitory synapses, a bimodal firing pattern was observed. This bimodal pattern illustrates the bistability of the network to fire at either a synchronous or antisynchronous state. These two states could be modes by which an individual perceives different frequencies in sound waves. Future research is looking into whether this <b>bistable</b> network embodies many of the properties of a <b>bistable</b> neuron, and if there is a larger gatekeeper modulating the network as a whole.|$|E
