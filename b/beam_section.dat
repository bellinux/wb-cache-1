In other countries, such as Germany, the originally designated fer arrondi (rounded profile) became a standardised rolling mill profile for wrought iron, its shape resembling an upside down rain gutter. It was used as surfacing on steel bridges, covering the deck girders and forming the base on which gravel, concrete or plaster for the actual trackbed was laid. It was spaced 2 to 3 centimetres apart in order to improved drainage. For the same purpose, usually for smaller loads, buckled plate was used.|$|E
50|$|The {{collimation}} of {{the machine}} means that, while rotating, the X-rays project only a limited portion of the anatomy onto the film at any given instant but, as the rotation progresses around the skull, a composite picture of the maxillo-facial block is created. While the arm rotates, the film moves in a such way that the projected partial skull image (limited by the <b>beam</b> <b>section)</b> scrolls over it and exposes it entirely. Not all of the overlapping individual images projected on the film have the same magnification because the beam is divergent and the images have differing focus points. Also not all the element images move with the same velocity on the target film as {{some of them are}} more distant from and others closer to the instant rotation center. The velocity of the film is controlled in such fashion to fit exactly the velocity of projection of the anatomical elements of the dental arch side which is closest to the film. Therefore, they are recorded sharply while the elements in different places are recorded blurred as they scroll at different velocity.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} hierarchical {{finite elements}} {{on the basis}} of the Carrera Unified Formulation for free vibrations analysis of <b>beam</b> with arbitrary <b>section</b> geometries. The displacement components are expanded in terms of the section coordinates, (x, y), using a set of 1 -D generalized displacement variables. N-order Taylor type expansions are employed. N is a free parameter of the formulation, it is supposed to be as high as 4. Linear (2 nodes), quadratic (3 nodes) and cubic (4 nodes) approximations along the beam axis, (z), are introduced to develop finite element matrices. These are obtained in terms of a few fundamental nuclei whose form is independent of both N and the number of element nodes. Natural frequencies and vibration modes are computed. Convergence and assessment with available results is first made considering different type of beam elements and expansion orders. Additional analyses consider different <b>beam</b> <b>sections</b> (square, annular and airfoil shaped) as well as boundary conditions (simply supported and cantilever beams). It has mainly been concluded that the proposed model is capable of detecting 3 -D effects on the vibration modes as well as predicting shell-type vibration modes in case of thin walled <b>beam</b> <b>sections...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{complete}} moment-curvature {{curves of}} doubly reinforced concrete beams made of normal- or high-strength concrete {{have been evaluated}} using a newly developed analytical method {{that takes into account}} the stress-path dependence of the constitutive properties of the materials. From the moment-curvature curves and the strain distribution results obtained, the post-peak behavior and flexural ductility of doubly reinforced normal- and high-strength concrete <b>beam</b> <b>sections</b> are studied. It is found that the major factors affecting the flexural ductility of reinforced concrete <b>beam</b> <b>sections</b> are the tension steel ratio, compression steel ratio and concrete grade. Generally, the flexural ductility decreases as the amount of tension reinforcement increases, but increases as the amount of compression reinforcement increases. However, the effect of the concrete grade on flexural ductility is fairly complicated, as will be explained in the paper. Quantitative analysis of such effects has been carded out and a formula for direct evaluation of the flexural ductility of doubly reinforced concrete sections developed. The formula should be useful for the ductility design of doubly reinforced normal- and high-strength concrete beams. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The past study {{indicates}} that, when the space joint of concentric annular-stiffer is loaded, stress concentration may generate at corner. The destruction usually concentrates {{in the joint}} region, and then cannot generate “strong joint”. To change this unfavorable characteristic, the reduced <b>beam</b> <b>section</b> connection is adopted. Through oriented reducing <b>beam</b> <b>section,</b> the plastic region is formed, which can achieve the aim of “weak beam, strong joint”. After the simulation and analysis to space joints on outer concentric annular-stiffer which are processed by reduced <b>beam</b> <b>section,</b> the loading conditions of the joints are obviously improved in the following aspects: (1) the stress distribution on annular plate is smoothed obviously, the degree of stress concentration on corner is significantly decreased; (2) to assure plastic hinge firstly appear on the beam end but not the ring surface, we can change the size of ring plate, length of beam and the flange weaken degree; (3) the joint stiffness does not decrease during the stage of elastic loading; (4) under repeated loading, the joint region has little change and the plastic expansion on the ring surface is not obvious. Above all, reducing <b>beam</b> <b>section</b> can improve the mechanical properties of CFST-steel beam space joints with outer concentric annular-stiffer, thus the “strong joint ” requirement could be fulfilled...|$|E

40|$|A {{previously}} established theoretical equation correlating the flexural ductility of a {{reinforced concrete}} <b>beam</b> <b>section</b> to the steel ratios and the concrete strength {{has been extended}} {{to account for the}} effects of the tension and compression steel yield strengths by means of a parametric study. Through the study, it was revealed that at a fixed degree of the <b>beam</b> <b>section</b> being under-or over-reinforced, the flexural ductility decreases slightly with the tension steel yield strength as well as the concrete strength but increases slightly with the compression steel yield strength. From charts plotting the flexural strength and flexural ductility that could be simultaneously achieved by a <b>beam</b> <b>section,</b> it was evident that the use of a higher concrete strength could increase either the flexural strength or the flexural ductility or both. On the other hand, at a given flexural strength, a higher tension steel yield strength would lead to lower flexural ductility while a higher compression steel yield strength would lead to higher flexural ductility. Lastly, a simple method of designing beam sections to meet any specified flexural ductility requirement has been proposed...|$|E

40|$|Inelastic {{behavior}} in steel special moment frames occurs {{through the development}} of plastic hinges at locations near the ends of the beam. The main objective of using a reduced beam connection is to force the formation of plastic hinges to be formed at the reduced <b>beam</b> <b>section</b> rather than at the ends of the beam which otherwise would lead to brittle failure of the beam-column connections. The beam has two reduced beam sections, each located at a certain distance {{from the face of the}} column, so that the plastic hinges are formed symmetrically at each of this section. When acted upon by lateral loads, the maximum moments occur at the ends of the beam. Therefore, the plastic hinges form at the reduced <b>beam</b> <b>section.</b> However, when a frame is subjected to a combination of gravity and lateral loads, the plastic hinge formation at one of the reduced <b>beam</b> <b>section</b> is not so clear and further analysis has to be done to study the effect. FEMA 350 indicates that the desired plastic hinge location is only valid for beams with gravity loads representing a small portion of the total flexural demand. If gravity demands significantly exceed 30 % of the girder plastic capacity then further plastic analysis of the frame should be performed to determine the appropriate hinge locations. The scope of my thesis is mainly to study the combined effect of gravity and lateral loads on the formation of plastic hinges in steel moment frames with reduced <b>beam</b> <b>section</b> connections...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Reduced <b>Beam</b> <b>Section</b> (RBS) moment {{connections}} are developed for Special Moment Resisting Frames (SMRF). According to {{the beam web}} attachment the column flange RBS {{connections are}} classified into Reduced <b>Beam</b> <b>Section</b> with Bolted web connections (RBS-B), and the Reduced <b>Beam</b> <b>Section</b> with Welded web connections (RBS-W). Beam flanges are welded to the column. Regardless of different web attachment details in RBS-B and RBS-W connections current design procedures (FEMA 350) assumes that they could develop plastic moment of the beam gross section. In current design procedures, RBS-B connections should provide the sufficient strength that can reach the plastic moment capacity of the connected beam. However, some experimental researches reported that the beams in RBS-B connections fractured before the connection reached its plastic moment capacity. Such undesirable fracture shows that RBS-B connections have less strength than RBS-W connections. And if RBS-B connections designed in current design procedures, it might fail in a brittle manner and not satisfy SMRF due to undesirable fracture. Thus, this study develops {{a new set of}} equations for accurately computing the moment strength of RBS-B connections. The proposed strength equation accurately predicts connection moment capacity for RBS-B connections...|$|E

In general, the number of the effective terms of the resultant theories is much lower than the full expansion case amount.
