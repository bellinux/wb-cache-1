30|$|The {{power control}} {{includes}} the following three functions: (1) receiving electrical power from batteries or an external power supply and providing power to the whole system, (2) a switch for the battery power line, and (3) monitoring the <b>battery</b> <b>voltage.</b> While the primary batteries work for the main electrical power source during observations, the power also can be supplied by an external power source connected to the control board. The latching relay on the battery power line can be switched by a <b>voltage</b> <b>signal</b> from the external board to start using the batteries just before deployment of the magnetometer system from the vessel. While <b>battery</b> <b>voltage</b> gradually decreases during seafloor observations, the controller board monitors the <b>battery</b> <b>voltage</b> and quits own operations with appropriate shutdown actions {{at the time of}} that the <b>battery</b> <b>voltage</b> reaches a configurable lower limit.|$|R
25|$|One other notable change {{occurred}} during the 1916 modifications. The high voltage propulsion control was replaced with a safer low voltage propulsion control, which utilized <b>battery</b> <b>voltage</b> (32 volts) to control the train's motors. This <b>battery</b> <b>voltage</b> was what would pass through the motorman's control stand and between cars. Tractive effort throughout the train was synchronized by the <b>battery</b> <b>voltage</b> in this way. Meanwhile, each car would respond individually to the <b>battery</b> <b>voltage,</b> by moving its own 600 volt contacts to direct power obtained locally by each car directly from the third rail toward the motors. Using 32 volts to control the propulsion in this way was a much safer proposition for trainmen and shop personnel than the 600 volts associated with the older high voltage setup.|$|R

50|$|This {{model is}} {{different}} from the other models discovered because it relies only on knowledge of the <b>battery</b> discharge <b>voltage</b> curve and access to <b>battery</b> <b>voltage</b> sensor which is available in all modern Smartphones. The basic idea for this model technique is to use battery state of discharge with running training software programs to control phone component power and activity states. Each individual Smartphone component is held in a specific state for a significant period of time and the change in battery state of discharge is captured using built-in <b>battery</b> <b>voltage</b> sensors. The first challenging idea is to convert <b>battery</b> <b>voltage</b> readings into power consumption. This is determined by state of discharge (which is total consumed energy by battery) variation within a testing interval captured by voltage sensors that will eventually drive the following equation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Inductively Coupled Power Transfer (ICPT) {{systems are}} {{designed}} to deliver power efficiently from a stationary primary source to movable secondary loads over air gaps via magnetic coupling.

This work proposes a design for practical electric vehicle charger suitable for any power vehicles (two wheelers, four wheelers, heavy motor). LCPT vehicle chargers are wireless and there is no contact problems and maintenance so it is a maintenance free charger. LCPT can charge different vehicles with different <b>battery</b> <b>voltages</b> without making any changes in the charger so the efficiency does not affect. Only the number of turns of the pickup coil (secondary coil) has to be adjusted at the time of manufacturing of the vehicles. This same concept can be used in traction system by neglecting the battery...|$|R
