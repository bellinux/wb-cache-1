5|$|Other venues are the <b>Bay</b> <b>Horse,</b> {{an older}} stone {{building}} {{at the corner of}} East Street and Stone Street, which has a conservatory, catering facilities and large car park. Whilst open for business, the <b>Bay</b> <b>Horse</b> is currently available for long term lease. The Fiddlers Three public house, located at Albion Street, is another older stone building with modern catering facilities. The Black House Inn, evidenced as the Coal Waggon Inn on ordnance survey maps in 1862 at the junction of Carr Hill Road and Co-operative Terrace, was partially demolished in 2011 {{to make way for a}} Tesco Extra store.|$|E
5|$|Paradox was a strongly-built <b>bay</b> <b>horse</b> bred by the Graham {{brothers}} at the Yardley Stud near Birmingham. He was sired by the 2,000 Guineas runner-up Sterling out of Casuistry, an undistinguished racehorse who {{had been}} sold cheaply {{at the end of}} her racing career by Lord Rosebery. Casuistry became an important broodmare, being the direct female ancestor of notable thoroughbreds such as Humorist, Royal Palace and Spend a Buck. As a yearling Paradox was bought for 700 guineas by the trainer John Porter on behalf of his associate, Captain Bowling. Porter trained the colt at his stable at Kingsclere.|$|E

5|$|Partbred Cleveland Bays are {{sometimes}} called Cleveland Bay Sporthorses, {{although they are}} referred to by the US and UK registries as part breds. They are eligible for registration with the Cleveland Bay Part Bred Registry, but must not be registered with any other registry. To be eligible, horses must {{have at least one}} grandparent registered with the main Cleveland <b>Bay</b> <b>Horse</b> Society stud book. The Australasian registry refers to part breds as Sporthorses, although they still require at least 25 percent Cleveland Bay blood.|$|E
5|$|Since 1977, Elizabeth II {{has been}} a patron of the Society, and during the Society's centenary year of 1984 she acted as its president. The British Cleveland <b>Bay</b> <b>Horse</b> Society also {{maintains}} a separate registry for part-bred horses. In the late 20th century, the breed again gained {{the attention of the}} United States public, and in 1985 the US association was reactivated, renamed the Cleveland Bay Society of North America. The US American Livestock Breeds Conservancy considers their status to be critical, which means there is an estimated global population of less than 2,000, and fewer than 200annual registrations in the United States. The UK Rare Breeds Survival Trust also considers their status to be critical, with less than 300breeding females registered worldwide. The Equus Survival Trust also considers the breed population to be at critical levels, meaning there are between 100 and 300breeding females left in the world. Currently, there are about 135purebred horses in the US and Canada recorded with the North American registry. There are also small populations in Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. In 2006, an estimated 550Cleveland Bay horses existed worldwide, of which about 220 were mares; the 2005 foal crop produced fewer than 50horses.|$|E
25|$|Frankel is a <b>bay</b> <b>horse</b> with a {{large white}} star, a white snip just above his nose, and four white feet. He was bred by Juddmonte Farms and trained by Henry Cecil, and is owned by Khalid Abdullah. He is named after the renowned and late American trainer Bobby Frankel.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bay</b> <b>horses</b> {{also have}} reddish coats, {{but they have}} a black mane, tail, legs and other [...] "points". The {{presence}} of true black points, even if obscured by white markings, means that a horse is not chestnut.|$|R
2500|$|Bay pintos are <b>bay</b> <b>horses</b> {{with any}} number of white {{spotting}} genes, including {{but not limited to}} tobiano, frame overo or splashed white, and so on. The pattern has no bearing on whether or not the <b>horse</b> is <b>bay.</b> Pinto <b>horses</b> also may have a bay base coat overlaid by white spots. Sometimes the term [...] "skewbald" [...] or [...] "tricolor" [...] is used, especially in the UK, to refer to bay pintos.|$|R
50|$|The {{most famous}} and {{successful}} line is the Bystrý. The founder was Stallion 469, foaled in 1919. The line {{is characterized by a}} robustness, shorter and a less solid run, steeper and a shorter fetlock. They are mainly <b>bay</b> <b>horses.</b>|$|R
25|$|In the 1860s and 1870s {{transport}} between Whitefield and Manchester {{consisted of}} a four-horse bus running at hourly intervals, with local passenger stops at the <b>Bay</b> <b>Horse</b> Inn at Chapelfield and at the Church Inn in {{the centre of the}} town. The firm which operated this service was called Turner, after which Turner Street was named.|$|E
25|$|Amber {{champagne}} {{refers to}} a <b>bay</b> <b>horse</b> {{with at least one}} dominant champagne allele. Black pigment is diluted to warm brown and red pigment to gold. The effect is similar to buckskin, but the points of an amber champagne do not remain black, and the skin is mottled. Amber champagnes also have hazel eyes rather than brown.|$|E
25|$|Silver bays are <b>bay</b> <b>horse</b> with {{at least}} one {{dominant}} silver (Z) allele. Red pigment is unaffected, but black pigment in the short coat is diluted to dark, flat, brown-gray while the longer hairs are diluted to silver. The overall effect on a bay is that of a chocolate-colored horse with a pale mane and tail.|$|E

50|$|Melanins, {{which provide}} {{color in the}} eyes, skin, and hair, are found in two types: eumelanin, which {{produces}} black to brown pigment, and phaeomelanin, which produces red to yellow pigment. Most horses can produce both types; the brown appearance of a <b>bay</b> <b>horse's</b> coat is caused by alternating bands of eumelanin and phaeomelanin, for which the agouti gene is responsible. Eumelanin predominates in the legs, mane and tail of <b>bay</b> <b>horses.</b> By contrast, horses which lack a functional agouti gene cannot produce such alternating bands, and thus have wholly black coats with no visible phaeomelanin. Chestnut horses lack the ability to manufacture eumelanin altogether, and so have wholly red coats devoid of true black pigment.|$|R
25|$|Tap Dance City is a <b>bay</b> <b>horse</b> bred in Kentucky by Echo Valley Horse Farm & Swettenham Stud. He was sired by the Eclipse Award winning {{stallion}} Pleasant Tap, whose other progeny {{included the}} Champion Stakes winner David Junior. His dam, All Dance, was a {{sister of the}} Kentucky Derby winner Winning Colors and produced several good winners including the leading British hurdler Ruling.|$|E
25|$|The Manx Electric Railway is an {{electric}} interurban tramway connecting Douglas, Laxey and Ramsey in the Isle of Man. It connects with the Douglas <b>Bay</b> <b>Horse</b> Tramway at its southern terminus at Derby Castle {{at the northern}} end of the promenade in Douglas, and with the Snaefell Mountain Railway at Laxey. The line is undulating and passes through areas of scenic beauty. Many visitors take an excursion on the trams.|$|E
25|$|Heart's Cry is a <b>bay</b> <b>horse</b> with {{a narrow}} white blaze and a white sock on his left hind leg, bred by the Yoshida family's Shadai Farm. He was sired by Sunday Silence, who won the 1989 Kentucky Derby, before {{retiring}} to stud in Japan where he was champion sire on thirteen consecutive occasions. His dam Irish Dance was a successful racemare who won twice at Group Three level. The horse was named after a number from the show Riverdance.|$|E

25|$|The pulsatile {{nature of}} ASIP {{signalling}} through MC1R produces the characteristic yellow and black agouti banding pattern observed on most mammalian hair. In some species, ASIP signaling {{is not of}} a pulsative nature, but is limited to certain regions. This is especially conspicuous in horses, where a <b>bay</b> <b>horse</b> has black legs, mane, and tail, but a reddish body. A notable exception to this is human hair, which is neither banded nor particoloured, so {{is thought to be}} regulated by α-MSH signaling through MC1R exclusively.|$|E
25|$|Petrarch was an {{exceptionally}} good-looking <b>bay</b> <b>horse</b> bred by J. E. Gosden at Midhurst in West Sussex. He was sired by the 1863 St Leger winner Lord Clifden, whose other progeny included the classic winners Jannette, Wenlock and Hawthornden {{as well as}} the leading sire Hampton. Petrarch's performances as a three-year-old enabled Lord Clifden to win his only sires' championship in 1876. Petrarch's dam Laura was a successful broodmare whose other foals included the Doncaster Cup winner Fraulein and the Craven Stakes winner Laureate.|$|E
25|$|El Condor Pasa {{was a dark}} <b>bay</b> <b>horse</b> with a {{large white}} star bred in Kentucky by his Japanese owner Takashi Watanabe. His sire, Kingmambo was a highly {{successful}} breeding stallion. His progeny included the British Classic winners Light Shift, Russian Rhythm, King's Best, Henrythenavigator, Virginia Waters and Rule of Law as well as major winners in Japan, France (Divine Proportions) and the United States (Lemon Drop Kid). Watanabe sent the horse into training with Yoshi Ninomiya, who operated a small stable with only ten horses.|$|E
60|$|There {{seemed to}} be a rushing in his ears through which pierced sharp, ringing clip-clop of iron hoofs. He could see only the corner of the street. But {{suddenly}} into that shot lean-limbed dusty <b>bay</b> <b>horses.</b> There was a clattering of nervous hoofs pulled to a halt.|$|R
25|$|Perlinos are <b>bay</b> <b>horses</b> who are {{homozygous}} for {{the dominant}} creme (CCr) allele. Both {{black and red}} pigment are diluted to some shade of creme, though the formerly black points often have a stronger reddish cast. The skin is a slightly pigmented pink and the eyes are blue.|$|R
2500|$|Prior to the 2016 running, <b>bay</b> <b>horses</b> had {{the most}} {{victories}} with 56. Chestnuts were close behind with 54 wins, followed by 33 dark bay/browns. Only three gray/roan horses had won (Belmar in 1895, Native Dancer in 1953, and High Echelon in 1970). In 2016, gray horses swept the top three positions ...|$|R
25|$|Danehill Dancer was a <b>bay</b> <b>horse</b> bred by L. K. and K. McCreery and foaled on 20 January 1993. He was sired by Danehill, {{who won the}} Haydock Sprint Cup in 1989. After {{retiring}} from racing Danehill became a leading stallion and was champion sire in Great Britain and Ireland, Australia and France. Amongst his best progeny are Dylan Thomas, Duke of Marmalade, Fastnet Rock, George Washington, North Light, Oratorio and Rock of Gibraltar. Danehill Dancer's dam is Mira Adonde, a daughter of Sharpen Up. Mira Adonde was trained by Alec Stewart, but only raced once, finishing seventh in a seven-furlong maiden race at Newmarket.|$|E
25|$|The armies met at dawn a {{few miles}} {{southwest}} of Springfield {{on the morning of}} August 10 in the Battle of Wilson's Creek. Lyon was wounded twice in the fighting; shot in the head and leg and his horse shot from under him. He returned to Union lines and commandeered a <b>bay</b> <b>horse</b> ridden by Maj. E.L. McElhaney of the Missouri Infantry. Lyon, badly outnumbered by Confederate forces, then dramatically led a countercharge of the 2nd Kansas Infantry on Bloody Hill, where he was shot in the heart at about 9:30 am. Although the Union Army was defeated at Wilson's Creek, Lyon's quick action neutralized the effectiveness of pro-Southern forces in Missouri, allowing Union forces to secure the state.|$|E
25|$|Deep Brillante is a <b>bay</b> <b>horse</b> {{standing}} 16.1 hands {{high with}} two white socks bred in Japan by the Paca Paca Farm. He {{was from the}} second crop of foals sired by Deep Impact who was the Japanese Horse of the Year in 2005 and 2006, winning races including the Tokyo Yushun, Tenno Sho, Arima Kinen and Japan Cup. Deep Impact's other progeny include Gentildonna, Harp Star, Kizuna and A Shin Hikari. Deep Brillante's dam Love and Bubbles was an American-bred, French-trained mare who won the Prix Chloe in 2004. She was a great-granddaughter of Bubble Company, a broodmare whose other descendants have included Bubble Gum Fellow and That's the Plenty (Kikuka Sho).|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the spiritual}} {{significance}} of a horse's mane, black and white mane hair was used to make spirit banners (tugs). Black hair indicated a war tug and white hairs a peace tug. The black hair was taken from <b>bay</b> <b>horses.</b> [...] Warriors wore a peaked helmet with a plume of horsehair on top.|$|R
2500|$|A few <b>bay</b> <b>horses</b> {{may carry}} the rabicano gene, which either {{produces}} faint roaning on only {{some parts of}} the body or can cause some white or cream hairs to appear in the mane or tail, sometimes creating a [...] "skunk" [...] effect. [...] Most bays with rabicano are registered as either bays or as bay roans.|$|R
50|$|Renamed several times, it was {{designated}} the Queen's Regiment of Dragoon Guards in 1746 as it {{evolved into a}} dragoon unit. (Dragoons described a force of highly mobile mounted infantry equipped with lighter,faster horses and carrying firearms) and later named the 2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays) in 1767 to reflect the custom of its soldiers riding only <b>bay</b> <b>horses.</b>|$|R
