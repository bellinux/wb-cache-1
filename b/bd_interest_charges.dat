50|$|A {{specific}} type of flexible mortgage common in Australia and the United Kingdom is an offset mortgage. The key feature of an offset mortgage {{is the ability to}} reduce the <b>interest</b> <b>charged</b> by offsetting a credit balance against the mortgage debt, with <b>interest</b> <b>charged</b> based on the outstanding net debt. Some lenders have a single account for all transactions, this {{is often referred to as}} a current account mortgage.|$|R
5000|$|The sum of {{the daily}} {{balances}} of the previous two cycles is used, but <b>interest</b> is <b>charged</b> on that amount only over the current cycle. This can result in an actual <b>interest</b> <b>charge</b> that applies the advertised rate to an amount that does not represent the actual amount of money borrowed over time, much different that the expected <b>interest</b> <b>charge.</b> The <b>interest</b> <b>charged</b> on the actual money borrowed over time can vary radically from month-to-month (rather than the APR remaining steady). For example, a cardholder with an average daily balance for the June, July, and August cycles of $100, 1000, 100, will have interest calculated on 550 for July, which is only 55% of the expected interest on 1000, and will have interest calculated on 550 again in August, which is 550% higher than the expected interest on the money actually borrowed over that month, which is 100.|$|R

2500|$|For example, if a user had a $1,000 {{transaction}} and repaid it in full {{within this}} grace period, {{there would be}} no <b>interest</b> <b>charged.</b> If, however, even $1.00 of the total amount remained unpaid, <b>interest</b> would be <b>charged</b> on the $1,000 from the date of purchase until the payment is received. The precise manner in which <b>interest</b> is <b>charged</b> is usually detailed in a cardholder agreement which may be summarized {{on the back of the}} monthly statement. The general calculation formula most financial institutions use to determine the amount of <b>interest</b> to be <b>charged</b> is (APR/100 x ADB)/365 x number of days revolved. Take the annual percentage rate (APR) and divide by 100 then multiply to the amount of the average daily balance (ADB). [...] Divide the result by 365 and then take this total and multiply by the total number of days the amount revolved before payment was made on the account. Financial institutions refer to <b>interest</b> <b>charged</b> back to the original time of the transaction and up to the time a payment was made, if not in full, as a residual retail finance charge (RRFC). Thus after an amount has revolved and a payment has been made, the user of the card will still receive <b>interest</b> <b>charges</b> on their statement after paying the next statement in full (in fact the statement may only have a <b>charge</b> for <b>interest</b> that collected up until the date the full balance was paid, i.e. when the balance stopped revolving).|$|R

40|$|Economic {{value added}} (EVA), {{which is the}} {{currently}} popular term for the traditional accounting concept of residual income, subtracts from operating income an <b>interest</b> <b>charge</b> for invested capital. This paper provides both a normative justification for EVA and an activity-based cost system that supports EVA maximization. We construct a model of participatory budgeting for a multi-activity firm in which we show that, if investment decisions are made myopically each period to maximize EVA, the resulting path of plant and equipment vectors asymptotically approximates the path that maximizes discounted cash flows. The cost system allocates plant and equipment cost to products using a formula that includes the <b>interest</b> <b>charge...</b>|$|R
50|$|From the 1950s {{until the}} end of her life Freud {{travelled}} regularly to the United States to lecture, to teach and to visit friends. She was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1959. During the 1970s she was concerned with the problems of emotionally deprived and socially disadvantaged children, and she studied deviations and delays in development. At Yale Law School, she taught seminars on crime and the family: this led to a transatlantic collaboration with Joseph Goldstein and Albert J.
