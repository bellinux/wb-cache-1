5|$|The survey {{continued}} {{to the south}} in Patagonia. They stopped at Bahía Blanca, and in cliffs near Punta Alta Darwin made a major find of fossil bones of huge extinct mammals beside modern seashells, indicating recent extinction with no signs of change in climate or catastrophe. He identified the little-known Megatherium by a tooth and its association with bony armour, which had at first seemed to him to <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> giant version of the armour on local armadillos. The finds brought great interest when they reached England.|$|E

5|$|Von Stroheim {{did not see}} Greed as {{political}} and told a journalist that he considered it to <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Greek tragedy. Despite the characters' struggles with poverty and class, von Stroheim followed the naturalist technique of portraying characters whose lives are driven by fate and their inner nature. Von Stroheim employed variations of this theme in his other films, which often involved a commoner {{falling in love with}} an aristocrat or royal.|$|E
5|$|Stone and Blackwell {{developed}} a private agreement aimed at preserving and protecting Stone’s financial independence and personal liberty. In monetary matters, {{they agreed that}} the marriage <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> business partnership, with the partners being “joint proprietors of everything except the results of previous labors.” Neither would have claim to lands belonging to the other, nor any obligation for the other’s costs of holding them. While married and living together they would share earnings, but if they should separate, they would relinquish claim to the other’s subsequent earnings. Each would {{have the right to}} will their property to whomever they pleased unless they had children. Over Blackwell’s objections, Stone refused to be supported and insisted on paying half of their mutual expenses. In addition to financial independence, Stone and Blackwell agreed that each would enjoy personal independence and autonomy: “Neither partner shall attempt to fix the residence, employment, or habits of the other, nor shall either partner feel bound to live together any longer than is agreeable to both.” During their discussion of marriage, Stone had given Blackwell a copy of Henry C. Wright’s book Marriage and Parentage; Or, The Reproductive Element in Man, as a Means to His Elevation and Happiness, and asked him to accept its principles as what she considered the relationship between husband and wife should be. Wright proposed that because women bore the results of sexual intercourse, wives should govern a couple’s marital relations. In accordance with that view, Blackwell agreed that Stone would choose “when, where and how often” she would “become a mother.” In addition to this private agreement, Blackwell drew up a protest of laws, rules, and customs that conferred superior rights on husbands and, as part of the wedding ceremony, pledged never to avail himself of those laws.|$|E

25|$|Kurzweil's main {{thesis is}} that these {{hierarchical}} pattern recognizers are used not just for sensing the world, but for nearly all aspects of thought. For example, Kurzweil says memory recall {{is based on the}} same patterns that were used when sensing the world in the first place. Kurzweil says that learning is critical to human intelligence. A computer version of the neocortex would initially <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> new born baby, unable to do much. Only through repeated exposure to patterns would it eventually self-organize and become functional.|$|E
25|$|Though {{there may}} be no {{evidence}} that the Founding Fathers intended the Constitution to <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> statute, this fact does not matter under Scalia's approach. Adherence to original meaning is explicitly divorced from the intent of the Founders; rather, the reasons for adhering to original meaning derive from other justifications, such as the argument that the understanding of the ratifiers (the people of the several States {{at the time of the}} adoption of the Constitution) should be controlling, as well as consequentialist arguments about original meaning's positive effect on rule of law.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the decline}} of the European eastern block during the late 1980s, {{performance}} art had actively been rejected by most communist governments. With the exception of Poland and Yugoslavia, performance art was more or less banned in countries where any independent public event was feared. In the GDR, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Latvia it happened in apartments, at seemingly spontaneous gatherings in artist studios, in church-controlled settings, or covered as another activity, like a photo-shooting. Isolated of the western conceptual context, in different settings it could <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> playful protest or like a bitter comment, using subversive metaphors to express dissent with the political situation.|$|E

25|$|According to Paul Churchland, Mary {{might be}} {{considered}} to <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> feral child. Feral children have suffered extreme isolation during childhood. Technically when Mary leaves the room, {{she would not have}} the ability to see or know what the color red is. A brain has to learn and develop how to see colors. Patterns need to form in the V4 section of the visual cortex. These patterns are formed from exposure to wavelengths of light. This exposure is needed during the early stages of brain development. In Mary's case, the identifications and categorizations of color will only be in respect to representations of black and white.|$|E
25|$|The aim of {{preliminary}} practices (ngöndro) is {{to start}} the student on the correct path for such higher teachings. Just as Sutrayāna preceded Vajrayāna historically in India, so sutra practices constitute those that are preliminary to tantric ones. Preliminary practices include all Sutrayāna activities that yield merit like hearing teachings, prostrations, offerings, prayers and acts of kindness and compassion, but chief among the preliminary practices are realizations through meditation on the three principle stages of the path: renunciation, the altruistic bodhicitta wish to attain enlightenment and the wisdom realizing emptiness. For a person without {{the basis of these}} three in particular to practice Vajrayāna can <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> small child trying to ride an unbroken horse.|$|E
25|$|Edward Fredkin and Konrad Zuse {{pioneered the}} idea of a computable universe, the former by writing a line in his book on how the world might <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{cellular}} automaton, and later further developed by Fredkin using a toy model called Salt. It has been claimed that NKS tries to take these ideas as its own but Wolfram's model of the universe if a rewriting network and not a cellular automaton as Wolfram himself has suggested a cellular automaton cannot account for relativistic features such as no absolute time frame. Jürgen Schmidhuber has also charged that his work on Turing machine-computable physics was stolen without attribution, namely his idea on enumerating possible Turing-computable universes.|$|E

25|$|The fifth {{article of}} faith relates to the Day of Judgment. According to the Ahmadis, after belief in one God, belief in the Day of Judgement is the most {{emphasized}} doctrine mentioned in the Quran. According to Ahmadi Muslim beliefs, the entire universe will {{come to an end}} on the Day of Judgment, a position also taken by all other Islamic sects and schools of thought. The dead will be resurrected and accounts will be taken of their deeds. People with good records will enter into Heaven while those with bad records will be thrown into Hell. Hell is understood in Ahmadiyya as a temporary abode, lasting an extremely long time but not everlasting, much like in mainstream Judaism. It is thought to <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> hospital, where souls are cleansed of their sins, and this view is based on the Quran and Hadith.|$|E
25|$|If Plato's {{important}} dialogues do {{not refer}} to Socrates' execution explicitly, they allude to it, or use characters or themes that {{play a part in}} it. Five dialogues foreshadow the trial: In the Theaetetus (210d) and the Euthyphro (2a–b) Socrates tells people that he is about to face corruption charges. In the Meno (94e–95a), {{one of the men who}} brings legal charges against Socrates, Anytus, warns him about the trouble he may get into if he does not stop criticizing important people. In the Gorgias, Socrates says that his trial will <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> doctor prosecuted by a cook who asks a jury of children to choose between the doctor's bitter medicine and the cook's tasty treats (521e–522a). In the Republic (7.517e), Socrates explains why an enlightened man (presumably himself) will stumble in a courtroom situation. The Apology is Socrates' defense speech, and the Crito and Phaedo take place in prison after the conviction. In the Protagoras, Socrates is a guest at the home of Callias, son of Hipponicus, a man whom Socrates disparages in the Apology as having wasted a great amount of money on sophists' fees.|$|E
