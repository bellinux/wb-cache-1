25|$|Before World War II, {{the first}} radars were {{developed}} for anti-aircraft purposes. These were soon followed by fire control radars for ships and coastal artillery <b>batteries.</b> <b>However,</b> it wasn't until decades later that improvements to technology proved that radar systems {{were capable of}} locating artillery guns.|$|E
25|$|That changed, however, {{in early}} February 1862. In a battle fought on 7–8 February, the joint {{operation}} of a Union Army division under Major General Ambrose E. Burnside and a naval flotilla under Flag Officer Louis M. Goldsborough captured Roanoke Island, a position in Croatan Sound that had previously shielded the sounds from Federal encroachment. Earlier, Union ships trying to enforce the blockade on the canals {{would have had to}} enter Pamlico Sound through Hatteras Inlet, then pass several Confederate batteries on Roanoke Island before they could get into Albemarle Sound. With the elimination of the <b>batteries,</b> <b>however,</b> all that stood {{in the way of the}} Union Navy was the Mosquito Fleet of the Confederate States Navy.|$|E
25|$|The gamble {{to carry}} out the {{operation}} in daylight proved successful. Daylight not only helped the aircraft to navigate better, but also greatly reduced the time required for units to assemble on the drop zones. This was achieved with over 5,200 sorties by fighters and bombers devoted to warding off the Luftwaffe and suppressing German flak <b>batteries.</b> <b>However,</b> it did not eliminate the need for pathfinders. The recovery rate for airdropped supplies also improved but was still poor. The 101st Airborne Division retrieved less than 50% of its supplies, while the 82nd Airborne Division, greatly aided by Dutch civilians, still managed less than 70%. The beleaguered British 1st Airborne Division retrieved less than 15% of its supplies. Major General James M. Gavin of the 82nd Airborne Division estimated that collecting all of the airdropped supplies would have required a third of men. Nothing like that was available in battle. In all, IX Tactical Air Command flew 4,242 aircraft and 1,899 glider sorties, losing 98 aircraft and 137 gliders. Nos 38 and 46 Groups RAF flew 1,340 aircraft and 627 glider sorties, losing 55 aircraft and two gliders.|$|E
25|$|Pandour {{returned}} to Britain in October 1804. There she was fitted as a floating <b>battery.</b> <b>However</b> she was {{paid off in}} February 1805.|$|R
50|$|The {{device was}} listed as {{compatible}} with 2 batteries. A normal slim-line and an ultra slim lower capacity <b>battery.</b> <b>However</b> the device was also battery compatible with the later R320 and R520 series.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mens rea}} and actus reus of indecent assault are {{essentially}} as for common law assault and/or <b>battery.</b> <b>However,</b> {{there is the}} additional element of 'indecent circumstances'. 'Indecent circumstances' are currently identified by the following: ...|$|R
25|$|Women {{have been}} {{integrated}} into the British Armed Forces since the early 1990s, including flying fast jets and commanding warships or artillery <b>batteries.</b> <b>However,</b> they remain excluded from primarily close combat units in the Army (Royal Armoured Corps and Infantry), Royal Marines, and Royal Air Force Regiment. As of 1 April 2014, there are approximately 15,840 women serving in the armed forces, representing 9.9% of all service personnel. The first female military pilot was Flight Lieutenant Julie Ann Gibson while Flight Lieutenant Jo Salter was the first fast-jet pilot, the former flying a Tornado GR1 on missions patrolling the then Northern Iraqi No-Fly Zone. Flight Lieutenant Juliette Fleming and Squadron Leader Nikki Thomas recently were the first Tornado GR4 crew. While enforcing the Libyan No-Fly Zone, Flight Lieutenant Helen Seymour was identified as the first female Eurofighter Typhoon pilot. In August 2011, {{it was announced that}} a female Lieutenant Commander, Sarah West, was to command the frigate HMS Portland. In July 2016, it was announced that women would be allowed to serve in close combat, starting with the Royal Armoured Corps. In July 2017, the Secretary of Defence announced that women will be allowed to enlist in the RAF Regiment from September 2017, a year ahead of schedule.|$|E
2500|$|In recent years, Better Place, Tesla Motors, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries {{have been}} {{involved}} with integrating battery switch technology with their electric vehicles to extend driving range. In a battery switch station, the driver does not {{need to get out of}} the car while the battery is swapped. Battery swap requires an electric car designed for the [...] "easy swap" [...] of <b>batteries.</b> <b>However,</b> electric vehicle manufacturers working on battery switch technology have not standardized on battery access, attachment, dimension, location, or type.|$|E
60|$|The Warreners {{with their}} guide {{experienced}} the difficulties which this increased {{activity of the}} attack caused to emissaries trying to enter or leave the Residency. After it had become dark they swam the Goomtee, and made a wide circuit, {{and then tried to}} approach the river again opposite the Residency. Several <b>batteries,</b> <b>however,</b> had been erected on this side since the guide had left, five days before, and these were connected by a chain of sentries, so closely placed {{that it would have been}} madness to endeavor to pass them unseen. It was clear that the mutineers were determined to cut off all communication to or from the garrison. The little party skirted the line of sentries, a line indicated clearly enough by the bivouac fires on the near side of them. Round these large numbers of mutineers were moving about, cooking, smoking, and conversing.|$|E
50|$|The 2nd Artillery Battery has {{the same}} kind of {{training}} as the 1st Artillery <b>Battery,</b> <b>however</b> those conscripts, who intend to complete non-commissioned officer training will be transferred from the 1st Artillery Battery to the 2nd Artillery battery.|$|R
25|$|After World War II {{the guns}} and {{infrastructure}} were decommissioned {{and parts of the}} railway removed. The 9.2-inch <b>battery,</b> <b>however,</b> was saved from disposal because the high cost of removing and shipping the guns to the mainland exceeded their value as scrap metal.|$|R
50|$|The 8800 {{comes with}} two BL-5X (600 mAh) batteries, with a manufacturer-specified talk time {{of up to}} 1.5-3 hours or up to 8 days standby time per <b>battery.</b> <b>However,</b> users found this was very optimistic and most users have to charge their phone several times a day.|$|R
6000|$|Half-past eleven, {{everything}} {{being ready}} on the Walck Hill, Friedrich's batteries opened there, {{in a sudden}} and volcanic way. Volcanically answered by the Russians, as soon as possible; who have 72 guns on this Muhlberg, and are nothing loath. Upon whom Finck's battery is opening from the north, withal: Friedrich has 60 cannon hereabouts; on the Walckberg, on the LITTLE Spitzberg (called SEIDLITZ HILL ever since); all playing diligently {{on the head and}} south shoulder of this Muhlberg: while Finck's battery opens on the north shoulder (could he but get near enough). Volcanic to a degree all these; nor are the Russians wanting, though they get more and more astonished: Tempelhof, who was in it, says he never, except at Torgau next Year, heard a louder cannonade. Loud exceedingly; and more or less appalling to the Russian imagination: but not destructive in proportion; the distance being too considerable,--"1,950 paces at the nearest," [...] as Tempelhof has since ascertained by measuring. Friedrich's two <b>batteries,</b> <b>however,</b> as they took the Russians in the flank or by enfilade, did good execution. [...] "The Russian guns were ill-pointed; the Russian batteries wrong-built; batteries so built as did not allow them sight of the Hollow they were meant to defend." [...] [Tempelhof, iii. 186, 187.] ...|$|E
50|$|The Dimâge EX uses four {{standard}} AA <b>batteries.</b> <b>However,</b> {{the many}} {{features of the}} Dimage causes relatively fast draining of batteries, compared to other digital cameras of its time.|$|E
50|$|Being entirely mechanical, a {{slide rule}} {{does not depend}} on grid {{electricity}} or <b>batteries.</b> <b>However,</b> mechanical imprecision in slide rules that were poorly constructed or warped by heat or use will lead to errors.|$|E
5|$|After a {{stubborn}} defence, {{in which a}} number of Commandos, including Pooley, were killed, they took the <b>battery,</b> <b>however,</b> shortly afterwards they were counterattacked by German force supported by self-propelled artillery. Casualties during this attack were high and eventually the Commandos were forced to withdraw back to La Plein.|$|R
50|$|In February 1865, Thayer was {{relieved}} of command of Fort Smith {{and sent to}} the smaller post at St. Charles, Arkansas, with a regiment of Kansas cavalry and a single artillery <b>battery.</b> <b>However,</b> with the omnibus promotions of leading generals {{at the close of the}} war, Thayer was brevetted major general of volunteers in 1865.|$|R
50|$|Treatment for aphasias is {{generally}} individualized, focusing on specific language and communication improvements, and regular exercise with communication tasks. Regular therapy for conduction aphasics {{has been shown}} to result in steady improvement on the Western Aphasia <b>Battery.</b> <b>However,</b> conduction aphasia is a mild aphasia, and conduction aphasics score highly on the WAB at baseline.|$|R
50|$|The Ragone {{plot was}} first used to compare {{performance}} of <b>batteries.</b> <b>However,</b> it is suitable to compare any energy-storing devices, as {{is shown in the}} graph on the right. The plot is named after David V. Ragone.|$|E
50|$|Power for the LED was {{provided}} by two AA <b>batteries.</b> <b>However,</b> because the game was mechanical, in the right light conditions, {{it was possible to}} play Blip without batteries as one could see the unlit LED under the screen.|$|E
5000|$|Use of an {{existing}} mobile device avoids the need to obtain and carry an additional OTP generator.

50|$|A {{little after}} 9am, the {{artillery}} {{to the right}} of Picquet Hill began its bombardment of the Babawali pass - the Afghans replied with a three field-gun <b>battery.</b> <b>However,</b> before Roberts could push his army forward, Afghan positions in the villages of Gundi Mulla Sahibdad on the British right and Gundigan on the British left, had to be cleared.|$|R
30|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} of the PCC had a {{very low}} significance on the temperature control of the <b>battery.</b> <b>However,</b> copper tubes were inserted into the PCM to increase the thermal conductivity and to assist as a coolant flow channel. Thus, a minimum number of tubes are inevitable for hybrid cooling to carry the latent heat out of the PCM cooling mass.|$|R
5000|$|... {{electric}} cars are significantly {{more expensive than}} conventional internal combustion engine vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles due {{to the cost of}} their <b>battery</b> pack. <b>However,</b> <b>battery</b> prices are coming down about 8% per annum with mass production, and are expected to drop further as competition increases.|$|R

50|$|Bonaventura Moreno was a Rear Admiral of the Spanish Navy. In 1781, he {{blockaded}} the British-held {{island of}} Minorca and soon {{took part in}} the Great Siege of Gibraltar as commander of the floating <b>batteries.</b> <b>However,</b> the Spanish and French forces were repulsed and the siege was a costly defeat for the allies.|$|E
50|$|Strong Poles are {{necessary}} to all street lights, especially to solar street lights as there are often components mounted {{on the top of}} the pole: fixtures, panels and sometimes <b>batteries.</b> <b>However,</b> in some newer designs, the PV panels and all electronics are integrated in the pole itself. Wind resistance is also a factor.|$|E
40|$|Nature has {{supplied}} abundant {{energy to}} plants {{in form of}} electricity and among them the xerophytics and specially the Opuntias have got the maximum due to adaptness of dry condition.

50|$|Olympus {{released}} a firmware update that {{was rumored to}} address <b>battery</b> life problems. <b>However,</b> <b>battery</b> life is still poor with alkaline batteries, below average with nickel metal halides batteries and good with lithium batteries (CRV3s).|$|R
2500|$|At dawn, Jackson had 3,000 troops marching on {{the city}}. [...] The Americans flanked {{the city from}} the east to avoid fire from the forts and marched along the beachfront, but the sandy beach made it {{difficult}} to move up the artillery. The attack went ahead nonetheless and was met with resistance {{in the center of town}} by a line of infantry supported by a <b>battery.</b> <b>However,</b> the Americans charged and captured the battery.|$|R
50|$|The Trust {{maintains}} {{a list of}} historically important buildings and structures, and gives advice on their preservation and restoration. With Gibraltar's long history as a garrison town and naval base, most of the listed structures are military, including defensive walls, bastions and <b>batteries.</b> <b>However,</b> the Trust also covers natural attractions and civilian structures such as caves and churches.|$|E
50|$|The 500 {{series of}} PowerBooks {{included}} {{the ability to}} use two batteries at the same time, allowing for 4 hours of battery life from two installed charged <b>batteries.</b> <b>However</b> the left battery also had an internal PDS slot that allowed for custom modules to be installed. Despite prototypes having been made, only two devices reached the market.|$|E
50|$|On {{the night}} of 14 March 1863, Farragut in Hartford and {{accompanied}} by six other ships, attempted to run by these <b>batteries.</b> <b>However,</b> they encountered such heavy and accurate fire that only the flagship and , lashed alongside, succeeded in running the gauntlet. Thereafter, Hartford and her consort patrolled between Port Hudson and Vicksburg denying the Confederacy desperately needed supplies from the West.|$|E
50|$|This method {{converts}} {{a reading}} of the battery voltage to SoC, using the known discharge curve (voltage vs. SoC) of the <b>battery.</b> <b>However,</b> the voltage is more significantly affected by the battery current (due to the battery's electrochemical kinetics) and temperature. This method can be made more accurate by compensating the voltage reading by a correction term proportional to the battery current, and by using a look-up table of battery's open circuit voltage vs. temperature.|$|R
40|$|The {{plates of}} a {{parallel}} plate capacitor used in Demonstration 19 are placed close together and charged using a 300 -volt battery. The electroscope does not deflect, {{because of the}} low voltage supplied by the <b>battery.</b> <b>However,</b> when the plates are separated the electroscope deflects, as seen in Figure 1, showing {{that the type of}} charge obtained from a battery {{is the same as the}} type of charge obtained from contact between the materials used in Demonstration 19...|$|R
50|$|In October 1779, {{construction}} of a road for carriages was begun at Middle Hill. Its purpose initially was to permit the transport of a gun to the planned Rock Gun <b>Battery.</b> <b>However,</b> the <b>battery</b> was completed prior to the road. Later that month, 24-pounder guns were brought to Middle Hill, {{in preparation for the}} {{construction of}} a new battery below Rock Gun Battery. On the 31 October 1779, the new battery was completed and was named the Royal Battery.|$|R
