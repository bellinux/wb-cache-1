While Facility Management Information Systems usually support <b>system</b> integration, <b>Automation</b> <b>Systems,</b> e. g. <b>Building</b> <b>Automation</b> <b>Systems</b> (BAS), are usually vendor-specific and rarely support it. It’s possible to integrate Computer-Aided Integrated Facility Management and some <b>Building</b> <b>Automation</b> <b>Systems,</b> but the literature about integrating such systems is still poor, however there’s significant need for integrating such systems. This integration has huge advantages, e. g. real-time data processing, integrating vendor-specific <b>building</b> <b>automation</b> <b>systems,</b> CAFM systems, CAD and ERP systems, etc. This paper gives a short overview about the background, limits, possibilities, and collects the special issues of the integration...|$|R

30|$|Considering {{the growing}} {{complexity}} of <b>building</b> <b>automation</b> <b>systems</b> {{and the huge}} number of available field and automation devices, which cannot be handled by planners and system integrators anymore, the need for automatic design approaches arises. Novel design tools are required that enable an automatic or semiautomatic design of <b>building</b> <b>automation</b> <b>systems</b> to strongly reduce the design time and overall design costs.

40|$|There is {{a strong}} push towards smart {{buildings}} that aim to achieve comfort, safety and energy efficiency, through <b>building</b> <b>automation</b> <b>systems</b> (BAS) that incorporate multiple subsystems such as heating and air-conditioning, lighting, access control etc. The design, commissioning and operation of BAS is already challenging when handling an individual subsystem; however when introducing co-operation between systems the complexity increases dramatically.

40|$|Abstract—Up to now, <b>building</b> <b>automation</b> <b>systems</b> were {{considered}} as virtually closed enviroments.

With the introduction of interconnections to foreign networks (e. g., Web gateways to the Internet) and wireless technologies, the assumption of physical isolation is not longer valid. In parallel, <b>building</b> <b>automation</b> <b>systems</b> {{of the next generation}} shall also be home for tight integrated services with seamless interworking nodes of formerly separated systems. When security-critical integration is considered, this promises synergies, but significantly tightens requirements on the protocol stack.

40|$|Intelligent <b>building</b> <b>automation</b> <b>systems</b> {{can reduce}} the energy {{consumption}} of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) units by sensing the comfort requirements automatically and scheduling the HVAC operations dynamically. Traditional <b>building</b> <b>automation</b> <b>systems</b> rely on fairly inaccurate occupancy sensors and basic predictive control using oversimplified building thermal response models, all of which prevent such systems from reaching their full potential. Such limitations can now be avoided due to the recent developments in embedded system technologies, which provide viable low-cost computing platforms with powerful processors and sizeable memory storage in a small footprint. As a result, <b>building</b> <b>automation</b> <b>systems</b> can now efficiently execute highly-sophisticated computational tasks, such as real-time video processing and accurate thermal-response simulations. With this in mind, we designed and implemented an occupancy-predictive HVAC control system in a low-cost yet powerful embedded system (using Raspberry Pi 3) to demonstrate the following key features for building automation: (1) real-time occupancy recognition using video-processing and machine-learning techniques, (2) dynamic analysis and prediction of occupancy patterns, and (3) model predictive control for HVAC operations guided by real-time building thermal response simulations (using an on-board EnergyPlus simulator). We deployed and evaluated our system for providing automatic HVAC control in the large public indoor space of a mosque, thereby achieving significant energy savings.
