6000|$|For the first, THAT THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE UNDER THE LAW, OR UNDER THE COVENANT OF WORKS, see, I pray you, that Scripture in the Third of the Romans, {{where the}} Apostle, {{speaking}} before of sins against the law, {{and of the}} denunciations thereof against those that are in that condition, he saith, [...] "What things soever the law saith, it saith to them who <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the law"; mark, [...] "it saith to them who <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world become guilty before God" [...] (Rom 3:19). That is, all those that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the law as a Covenant of Works, that are yet in their sins, and unconverted, as I told you before. Again he saith, [...] "But if ye be led by the Spirit, ye <b>are</b> not <b>under</b> the law" [...] (Gal 5:18). Implying again, that those which are for sinning against the law, or {{the works of the}} law, either as it is the old covenant, these <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the law, and not under the Covenant of Grace. Again he saith, [...] "For as many as are of the works of the law <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the curse" [...] (Gal 3:10). That is, they that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the law <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the curse; for mark, they that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the Covenant of Grace <b>are</b> not <b>under</b> the curse. Now, there are but two covenants, therefore, it must needs be that they that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the curse <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the law, seeing those that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the other covenant <b>are</b> not <b>under</b> the curse, but under the blessing. [...] "So, then, they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham," [...] but the rest <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the law (Gal 3:9).|$|R
