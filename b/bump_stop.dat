5000|$|The wheels were {{designed}} and manufactured by General Motors Defense Research Laboratories in Santa Barbara, California. Ferenc Pavlics was given special recognition by NASA {{for developing the}} [...] "resilient wheel". They consisted of a spun aluminum hub and a 32 in diameter, 9 in wide tire made of zinc-coated woven 0.033 in diameter steel strands attached to the rim and discs of formed aluminum. Titanium chevrons covered 50% of the contact area to provide traction. Inside the tire was a 25.5 in diameter <b>bump</b> <b>stop</b> frame to protect the hub. Dust guards were mounted above the wheels. Each wheel had its own electric drive made by Delco, a direct current (DC) series-wound motor capable of [...] at 10,000 rpm, attached to the wheel via an 80:1 harmonic drive, and a mechanical brake unit.|$|E
40|$|Bump stops are {{components}} used in {{the truck}} chassis for the wheel suspension and cab suspension. Their main purpose {{is to reduce the}} impact between e. g. front axle and frame when the suspension bottoms. In these situations, the <b>bump</b> <b>stop</b> undergoes compressions with large deformations and high velocities. The dynamics of these components are difficult to describe since the material characteristics for rubber are highly non-linear. The simulation models that are available for the MBS software Adams are highly simplified and do not describe these events in a satisfactory manner. Hence the goal for this thesis work was to develop a simulation model for bump stops based on the results from dynamic testing. The simulation model uses the variables displacement and velocity to calculate the force being transferred through the <b>bump</b> <b>stop.</b> Four different bump stops were subjected to quasi-static and dynamic loading while the force and displacement were measured. The experiments were carried out in a hydraulic press and a test rig designed for this purpose where several weights were dropped onto the <b>bump</b> <b>stop</b> from different heights. A simulation model consisting of an elastic and a visco-elastic force response along with a rate-independent friction model was derived based on the experimental data. The model includes 14 parameters that can be identified through quasi-static and dynamic measurements of the particular component. A subroutine was written in order to implement the proposed model in Adams and a virtual model of the test rig was created. A number of dynamic simulations were performed in order to verify the model by comparing the results to experimental data. A FE-analysis was carried out on two of the tested bump stops and it was found that some of the <b>bump</b> <b>stop</b> characteristics could possibly be obtained without performing any experiments on physical components.

40|$|The studied <b>bump</b> <b>stop</b> is {{a hollow}} folded {{polyurethane}} cylinder mounted around the damper rod in a MacPherson front wheel suspension, restricting the upward wheel displacement. It {{is a critical}} component for durability since the force transfer through the <b>bump</b> <b>stop</b> determines the vertical peak loads to the car body. In extreme load cases as driving over a curb, the <b>bump</b> <b>stop</b> is subjected to impact loading giving a highly non-linear behavior. The nominal compressive strain can reach 80 % under a load duration of milliseconds. The presented model is based on impact test data. By performing drop tests, high load levels and short contact times can be combined, giving a realistic loading in view of road load data from the test track. The main objective of the model is to predict the behavior at high strain rates and strain levels. The strongly progressive behavior, shown in a stress strain diagram, {{both in terms of}} the loading curve and the hysteresis, requires special attention. The main feature of the model is a linear viscoelastic Maxwell model combined with a function that takes care of the strongly progressive behavior. This function, obtained from a dynamic loading curve in the impact test, is multiplied with the Maxwell stress, giving the sought progressive behavior. The model is accurate, simple to obtain from the impact test, computationally efficient, and easy to implement in commercial multi-body-system codes as ADAMS and can thus successfully be used in the product development of new cars...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of piezoelectric cantilever beam energy harvesters subjected to base excitation is considered in this work. Based on the linear assumption, a theoretical model is developed {{to predict the}} mechanical and electrical responses of the harvester and in comparison to other theoretical models, more accurate mode shape functions are used for the structural part of the harvester. The model is validated against experimental measurements and parameter studies are carried out to investigate the maximum power output in different situations. In some applications, like powering tyre pressure monitoring sensors (TPMS), energy harvesters are subjected to large amplitude shocks {{and high levels of}} acceleration, which can cause large bending stresses to develop in the beam, leading to mechanical failure. In this work, a <b>bump</b> <b>stop</b> is introduced in the energy harvester design to limit the amplitude of vibration and prevent large amplitude displacement. A theoretical model is developed to simulate the energy harvester impacting a stop, and the model is used to investigate how the electrical output of the harvester is affected by the stop. The work demonstrates how the model {{can be used as a}} design tool for analysing the compromise between the electrical output and structural integrity. Nonlinear behaviour of the energy harvester is observed to have a significant effect on the resonance frequencies when the harvester is subjected to large amplitude base accelerations. To correctly predict the behaviour of the harvester, piezoelectric material nonlinearity and geometric nonlinearity are incorporated in the theoretical model. It is found that the nonlinear softening effect is dominated by the material nonlinearity, while the geometric nonlinearity is less significant. The nonlinear energy harvester model is used in conjunction with the <b>bump</b> <b>stop</b> and results obtained using the linear and nonlinear models are compared to experimental measurements to investigate the importance of using a nonlinear model. The inclusion of nonlinear behaviour is shown to improve significantly the accuracy of predictions under some circumstances. The energy harvester models developed in this work are used to simulate the electrical power generated in a TPMS application, where the harvester embedded in the tyre is subjected to large radial accelerations as the tyre rolls along the road.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Raylı taşıt dinamiği demiryolu mühendisliğinin temel konularından biridir. Farklı fiziksel koşullar altında aracın davranışı yapılan dinamik analizler sonucu belirlenir. Aracın dinamiğini etkileyen temel parametreler taşıtın boyutları, kütle ve atalet değerleridir. Ayrıca süspansiyon elemanlarının yay ve sönüm katsayıları ve bu elemanların bağlantı noktalarının konumları da taşıt dinamiğini etkilmektedit. Taşıtın davranışını belirleyen bir diğer önemli parametre ise tekerlek ve ray profilidir. Tekerlek profilinin yuvarlanma düzlemi aracın düz yoldaki davranışını, flanş bölgesi ise kurptaki davranışını belirlemektedir. Metro ve hafif metro sistemlerinde tekerlek profili standartlar tarafından belirlenirken tramvay hatlarında ise işletmeci tarafından hat karakteristikleri ve işletme hızı gibi parametreler göz önünde bulundurularak belirlenmektedir. Tekerlek profili tasarımında dikkat edilmesi gereken ana husus konfor-güvenlik ilişkisinin doğru bir şekilde kurulmasıdır. Bu tez kapsamında raylı taşıt dinamiğinde önemli bir etkiye sahip olan tekerlek-ray teması üzerinde durulmuştur. Öncelikle Simpack yazılımında bir tramvay aracına ait 52 serbestlik dereceli dinamik model oluşturulmuştur. Daha sonra üç farklı tekerlek profili (TTP 1, TTP 2 ve TTP 3) modele eklenerek performansları incelenmiş ve karşılaştırılmıştır. Yapılan kararlılık, konfor ve kurp analizleri sonucunda TTP 2 ve TTP 3 profilleri konfor, yanal kararlılık açısından daha iyi sonuçlar verdiği gözlemlenmiştir. Kurp analizinde ise her üç profilinde güvenlik sınırlarını aşmamakla birlikte TTP 1 profilinin deray oranı daha düşük çıkmıştır. Yapılan bu tez ile modellenen tramvay aracının dinamik sürüş performansı bakımından en uygun tekerlek profili belirlenmiştir. Önerilen tekerlek profili ile konfor iyileştirilirken güvenlik standartlar tarafından belirlenen sınırlar içerisinde tutulmuştur. Metro and trams {{are one of}} {{the most}} cost {{effective}} vehicles in urban transportation. This is due to the low energy loss of metal on metal contact between wheels and rail. The advantageous characteristics in passenger carrying capacity and punctual operation make them more preferable than other urban transportation vehicles. They also offer a secure and comfortable trip for passengers. Metro and trams differ from other railway vehicles in operating conditions. Some main differences are the distance between stations, passenger capacity, braking and acceleration. Especially tram vehicles’ design inputs vary considerably since they are operated within the motorway traffic and with respect to city’s weather condition and geological specification. The selection of railway wheel and rail profiles is a challenge that has faced engineers since the dawn of the railway age. This thesis is mainly focused on rail-wheel profile contact which has a very important effect on railway vehicle dynamics. Metro and light rail vehicle wheel profiles are determined with respect to the predefined standards. However in tramways, it is determined by the operator considering the parameters such as line characteristics and operating speeds. Increasing axle loads, the presence of tight curves and light vehicles causes more complexitty for wheel/rail interface. These differing requirements are all oriented toward same targets; increased durability and comfort, reduction of maintenance costs, and increased safety. First of all, the dynamic model is created in Simpack software. The dynamic behaviour of a railway vehicle can be analysed using three types of analysis: • linear analysis, for the evaluation of the vehicle model eigenvalues; • stability analysis, used for the evaluation of the critical speed of the vehicle; • dynamic analysis, to simulate the actual behaviour of the railway system in operating conditions. The complete vehicle–track system can be split up into three subsystems: vehicle, wheel–rail contact, and track. The first step in every vehicle computer simulation is to set up a mechanical model appropriate to fulfil the desired simulation task. The multibody system (MBS) approach is a powerful and widely used method for this procedure, especially if the vehicle’s running behaviour is to be analyzed. The typical model of a railway vehicle is composed of the three sub-assemblies: the car body, the front bogie, trailer bogie and the rear bogie. Each bogie consists of the bogie frame, bolster, and two wheelsets. In this research, the car body and bogie frames, as well as the wheelsets are treated as rigid bodies and are defined by their mass–inetria characteristics (mass, moments of inertia, and the position of the centre of gravity), and by the relative position of the bogies with respect to the car body itself. Each rigid body has six degrees of freedom; three translations and three rotations. All bodies are connected by linear and non-linear springs and dampers, representing the primary and secondary suspensions. Primary and secondary suspensions are often used to support the carbody components and to provide vibration isolation. The primary suspension is connected between the wheelset and the side frame, while the secondary suspension is connected between the bolster and the side frame. The primary and secondary suspensions consist of spring, damper, <b>bump</b> <b>stop</b> and trailer arm. Difference between contact areas is presented by creating contact models for these three wheel profiles. Mode frequencies and dampings are investigated by applying the modal analysis to investigate the stability of the system. Resonance characteristics of components such as carbody, bogie and bolster are observed with the aid of their mode shapes. Stability of the system indicated by investigating the damping values and root-loci figures for a speed range of 0 - 70 km/h. On the other hand, after the analysis of the most critical curve area under operating conditions, equivalent conicity did not exceed the limits. Lateral irregularity is applied to the straight track to see the lateral movement of the carbody during maximum velocity of 70 km/h. Lateral movement of the carbody is absorbed in time after the analysis and stability of the vehicle is proved for these conditions. Superiority of the TTP 2 and TTP 3 wheel profiles is shown by the lateral stability analysis results. Comfort index from EN 12299 standard is compared between three wheel profiles by using a track irregularity which is defined in ORE B 176 and also superiority of the TTP 2 and TTP 3 is investigated with respect to comfort for passengers. L/V ratio, creepages, creep forces and lateral forces are compared for each wheel profile by curve analysis for the most critical curve in the line. As a result, altough none of the wheel profiles exceed the safety limit, TTP 1 profile yields much safer results. On the other hand, TTP 2 and TTP 3 generates lower lateral forces during the curve than TTP 1 profile. Therefore, TTP 2 and TTP 3 profiles have superior characteristcs for maintenance costs and irregularites on wheel and rail profile. To sum up, TTP 1 profile is safer for curve analysis and TTP 2 and TTP 3 profiles have superior lateral stability and comfort characteristics and less lateral forces generated acting on the rail. Basic principle for wheel profile design process is building the relation between comfort and safety in a proper way. Comfort should be improved while safety limits should not be exceeded for designed wheel profile. With respect to these informations, optimization can be done on the wheel tread and flange area to get better results for safety and comfort. Additionally, profiles can be compared for wear conditions. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

5000|$|Since then, {{millions}} of fairly inexpensive Citroën cars have been equipped with self-levelling as an unobtrusive, but integral design feature. The Citroën's dashboard (later console or fascia mounted controls) includes a position lever {{which allows the}} driver to select whether the car would sit with the body in high, intermediate, normal or low positions, the extremes used for maintenance such as changing wheels or hydraulic system work. Up until 1995 when they added [...] "antisink" [...] to the range when the engine was turned off, the suspension slowly lost pressure until the car rested on the <b>bump</b> <b>stops.</b> When the engine was restarted it rose back to its pre-selected height. The addition of anti-sink added 2 non-return valves and an extra accumulator so that when hydraulic pressure was lost the valves would close and keep the remaining fluid in the system, and leaving the car resting at a normal height when parked.|$|R
50|$|Its central {{hydraulic}} system, powering the four disc brakes (inboard in front to help lower unsprung weight) and the advanced hydro-pneumatic self-levelling suspension, {{was derived from}} the Citroën DS. It also has a feature that increased or decreased braking pressure in accordance with cargo load, without any noticeable difference in the brake pedal response. The powered system was different from the typical assisted systems in that there was virtually no travel on the brake pedal even when braking hard. The hydraulic suspension allowed the car to be raised for rough terrain at low speeds (a feature taking account of the country lanes of its native France) and to full height for easy access to the partially enclosed rear wheels. The hand brake lever is mounted on the dashboard as opposed to being mounted between the front seats. In car entertainment can be fitted in the space that would have been utilised by the handbrake. As with other Citroën cars, the hydraulic system depressurizes over several hours, so the car will sink to the <b>bump</b> <b>stops</b> when the engine is off.|$|R

Relatively simple systems giving good quantitative results can be used to represent a vehicle in motion over a variety of courses. 2.

40|$|Since 1994, various {{mines in}} the US have cooperated with {{research}} {{scientists at the}} Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories to address issues related to verification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). The CTBT requires that no country may conduct any nuclear explosion in the future. While the CTBT is a significant step toward reducing the global nuclear danger, verifying compliance with the treat requires that the monitoring system be able to detect, locate and identify much larger numbers of smaller amplitude seismic events than had been required previously. Large mining blasts conducted world-wide will be of sufficient amplitude to trigger the monitoring system at the lower threshold.

Upper control arms are constructed from forged steel that is both stronger and lighter than the previous arms, while the new lower arms are cast iron to maximize load capacity. Using a unique torsion bar for each gross weight rating allows for better control over vehicle height, resulting in improved handling and better alignment for reduced tire wear.

40|$|This thesis {{concentrates}} on two competing performance requirements of general suspension systems: "smoothness" and tracking. The {{focus of the}} thesis is on real-time feedback controls which can be applied in microprocessors with relatively limited capacity. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are used as a tool {{in the investigation of}} a wide range of control algorithms. Jerk (the rate of change of acceleration) is used as the basis of the suspension comfort performance measure, and a nonlinear cost function is applied to tracking, which targets the travel limits of the suspension (termed the "rattlespace"). Tracking measures currently in use generally fail to explicitly refer to the working space width. This matter is analysed, showing that driver slowdown is a complicating factor. The test rig of the physical experiment is of the semi-active type. High performing semi-active controls are generally based on active controls. Thus active controls are also investigated in this thesis. By stiffening the suspension as it moves away from equilibrium it can be made to combine softness over smooth roads with the capacity to react to large bumps when needed. Electronic control produces a much greater range of possible responses than is possible with just rubber or neoprene <b>bump</b> <b>stops.</b> Electronic, real-time control can attempt to target a smooth chassis trajectory within the possible future limits of rattlespace. Two general methods are proposed and analysed: one that adjusts the suspension stiffening according to the current road state, and another that targets edge trajectories within the possible future movements of the rattlespace. Some of these controls performed very well. With further investigation, they may be developed into extremely high performance controls, especially because of their high adaptability to varying conditions. The problem of avoiding collisions with rattlespace limits is related to the problem of avoiding overshoot of a limit distance. It becomes apparent that the residual acceleration at the point of closest approach needs to be limited, otherwise instability results. This led to the search for controls that attain rest without overshooting the final rest position. It was found that the minimum jerk needed for a general minimum-time control that does not overshoot zero displacement is always the control with just one intermediate switch of control, instead of two switches that are generally needed. This was proven to be optimal, and because of its optimality it works consistently when applied as a closed-loop, real-time optimal control. This control deals with the most difficult part of the trajectory: the final, "docking" manoeuvre. The control proved to be robust in physical experiments and it may itself have a number of applications. Some heuristics have been developed here to account for stochastic movement of the rattlespace edges in suspension controls, and these have proven quite successful in numerical experiments. Semi-active suspensions have a limit on the forces they can apply (the passivity constraint), but clipped versions are known to produce uncomfortable jerk. One method developed in this thesis produces a vast improvement in semi-active controls in the numerical experiments...|$|R

Afterwards, modification of new process technologies by users is_ limited by the increasing routinization that occurs with_experience. Thus, the technology and its context of use tend to congeal, often embedding unresolved problems into organizational practice. Subsequent changes appear U 3 occur in an episodic manner, niggered either by discrepant events or by new discoveries on the part of users. These findings have important implications for theones of technological change. "Here is Edward Bear, coming downstairs now, bump, bump, bump, {{on the back of his}} head behind Christopher Robin.

And then he feels that perhaps there isn't. Anyhow, here he is at the bottom and ready to be intro-duced to you. The theme of this issue is the struggle of workers and Third World peoples against oppressive science. Writing for academics cops out- we must deal with the struggles of people who are oppressed through the complicity of scien-tists if Science for the People is to mean anything. The articles accordingly deal with industrial safety, science in the exploitation of the Third World, pregnancy testing by the phone company and thought control in South Africa. For the armed Angolan woman on the cover the struggle is not an intellectual excercise. In addition to the articles contributed, the letters and chapter reports from our comrades add the perspective of those involved in day to day organizing activity. We would like to thank everyone who contributed to and helped with this issue, and encourage others to write...|$|R
