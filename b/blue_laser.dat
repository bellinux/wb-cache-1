25|$|Because all {{variants}} except 3× DVD and HD REC {{employed a}} <b>blue</b> <b>laser</b> with a shorter wavelength, HD DVD stored about 3.2 {{times as much}} data per layer as its predecessor (maximum capacity: 15GB per layer compared to 4.7GB per layer).|$|E
25|$|The {{emergence}} of high definition players followed {{the entry of}} HDTV televisions into the mainstream market in the mid-2000s. Consumer-grade high definition players required an inexpensive storage medium capable of holding the larger amount of data needed for HD video. The breakthrough came with Shuji Nakamura's invention of the <b>blue</b> <b>laser</b> diode, whose shorter wavelength {{opened the door to}} higher density optical media following a six-year patent dispute.|$|E
25|$|The {{dimensions}} of the components may be dictated by the distance from transmitter to receiver, the wavelength and the Rayleigh criterion or diffraction limit, used in standard radio frequency antenna design, which also applies to lasers. Airy's diffraction limit is also frequently used to determine an approximate spot size at an arbitrary distance from the aperture. Electromagnetic radiation experiences less diffraction at shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies); so, for example, a <b>blue</b> <b>laser</b> is diffracted less than a red one.|$|E

50|$|Until {{the late}} 1990s, when <b>blue</b> {{semiconductor}} <b>lasers</b> were developed, <b>blue</b> <b>lasers</b> were large and expensive gas laser instruments which relied on population inversion in rare gas mixtures and needed high currents and strong cooling.|$|R
50|$|An alternative, hi-tech {{approach}} is dispersometry using two different wavelengths of light. Only recently <b>blue</b> <b>lasers</b> have become readily available {{making this a}} realistic proposition.|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, {{commercial}} HDTV sets started {{to enter a}} larger market, {{but there was no}} inexpensive way to record or play back HD content. JVC's D-VHS and Sony's HDCAM formats could store that amount of data, but were neither popular nor well-known. It was well known that using lasers with shorter wavelengths would yield optical storage with higher density. Shuji Nakamura invented practical <b>blue</b> <b>laser</b> diodes, but a lengthy patent lawsuit delayed commercial introduction.|$|E
25|$|Backward {{compatibility}} {{is available}} with all HD DVD players, allowing users {{to have a}} single player to play all types of HD DVD, DVD and CD. There is also a hybrid HD DVD format which contains both DVD and HD DVD {{versions of the same}} movie on a single disc, providing a smooth transition for the studios in terms of publishing movies, and allowing consumers with only DVD players to still use the discs. DVD replication companies can continue using their current production equipment with only minor alterations when changing over to the format of HD DVD replication. Due to the structure of the single-lens optical head, both red and <b>blue</b> <b>laser</b> diodes can be used in smaller, more compact HD DVD players.|$|E

5000|$|Diode lasers which emit {{light at}} 445 nm are {{becoming}} popular as handheld lasers. Lasers emitting wavelengths below 445 nm appear violet (but are sometimes called <b>blue</b> <b>lasers).</b> Some {{of the most}} commercially common <b>blue</b> <b>lasers</b> are the diode lasers used in Blu-ray applications which emit 405 nm [...] "violet" [...] light, which is a short enough wavelength to cause fluorescence in some chemicals, {{in the same way}} as radiation further into the ultraviolet ("black light") does.

Many weapons contain slots for the {{insertion}} of [...] "upgrade cores"; depending on the core, upgrades can affect a weapon's rate of fire, clip size, damage, or other mechanics. Random items and loot, such as new (and more powerful) weapons and upgrade cores, drop at random intervals and when enemies are defeated. The class of a drop differs by rarity, ranging from [...] "stock" [...] to [...] "legendary" [...] class. Unwanted items can be converted into metal, which is then used to re-roll [...] a weapon's statistics. Aiming is accomplished by targeting a <b>blue</b> <b>laser</b> in the direction a player wishes to shoot.

50|$|The {{oxidized}} dyes in the expired discs absorb {{primarily at}} the wavelength {{of the current}} diode lasers (red, 650 nm) used in the DVD players. However, {{the new generation of}} DVDs is designed to use <b>blue</b> <b>lasers</b> at 450-460 or even 405 nm, for which the methylene blue is essentially transparent. While SpectraDisc did not take this in account, the Flexplay discs incorporate a layer of a color filter, blocking the <b>blue</b> <b>lasers</b> from reading the disc, expired or not. Acridine Yellow can be used for this purpose, together with 9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene, and a scale of different azo dyes, aromatic hydrocarbons, and other dyes. The dyes can be added directly to the polycarbonate resin the discs are made of.|$|R
50|$|Red's {{wavelength}} {{has been}} an important factor in laser technologies; red lasers, used in early compact disc technologies, are being replaced by <b>blue</b> <b>lasers,</b> as red's longer wavelength causes the laser's recordings to take up more space on the disc than would blue-laser recordings.|$|R

2500|$|Cheat Commandos is {{a parody}} of G.I. Joe that {{features}} a cast of characters that are the same species as The Cheat. Most are based on G.I. Joe characters. For example, the character Crackotage is based on Roadblock, but with a voice more like Scatman Crothers, while Reinforcements' generic name and appearance is reminiscent of common grunt soldiers. The enemy of the Commandos is <b>Blue</b> <b>Laser,</b> a direct parody of Cobra, who have their equivalent of Cobra Commander, known as <b>Blue</b> <b>Laser</b> Commander. The cartoon is constantly advertising its products in the cartoons by such methods as referring to the areas they are in as [...] "playsets", a convoy truck as an [...] "action figure storage vehicle", and by ending each cartoon with the phrase [...] "Buy all our playsets and toys!", sung in a patriotic way. It also parodies the G.I. Joe cartoons' use of public service announcements, referring to nonsensical things like [...] "peer-2-teen choice behaviors." [...] Other cartoons feature the character Crack Stuntman, the fictional voice actor for the Cheat Commandos character Gunhaver. While G.I.

2500|$|Glacier {{was also}} given {{one of the}} most extravagant entrances in wrestling at the time, which {{consisted}} of <b>blue</b> <b>laser</b> lights streaming across the arena and synthetic snow falling from the ceiling, while the ring was enveloped in blue lighting. Production costs for the entrance amounted to nearly half a million dollars, while the costume and armor, designed by Andre Freitas of Atlanta-based AFX Studios, cost $35,000. The number 126 was carved into the armor's single breastplate as a reference to his father's badge number. Glacier wore a blue contact lens in his right eye to top off the outfit, which often prompted comments from WCW Monday Nitro analyst Bobby Heenan, such as [...] " [...] half man, half Siamese cat." [...] After slowly walking to the ring, he then engaged in a ritual of standing on a center turnbuckle in order to remove his armor and mask, then somersaulting off the buckle and {{into the center of the}} ring to perform a kata routine; this process sometimes lasted as long as two minutes. Moreover, since he was a face character, he would bow to the referee and his opponent. To further accentuate the character's image, Lloyd, a natural brunette, temporarily bleached his hair blond from April to December 1997.|$|E
