500|$|Despite the acquittal, {{the broader}} public {{perception}} was strong that Thorpe had not behaved well, nor had he adequately explained himself. The Archdeacon of Barnstaple, who {{was critical of}} Hornby's melodramatic thanksgiving service, wrote: [...] "There {{is a great deal}} of unhappiness [...] about the result at the Old Bailey. [...] As far as most people are concerned, the trial ended with a <b>big</b> <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> over the case". Prevented by his party from a return to active politics, in 1982 Thorpe was appointed by Amnesty International as director of its British section, but after protests from the organisation's staff, he withdrew. Not long afterwards, Thorpe first showed signs of the Parkinson's disease that led to his almost complete withdrawal into private life in the mid-1980s. There was a political reconciliation when, in 1988, following the merger of the Liberals and the Social Democratic Party, the newly formed North Devon Liberal Democrat association made him their honorary president. When he attended the Liberal Democrat party conference in 1997 he received a standing ovation. In 1999, Thorpe published his political memoir, In My Own Time, in which he justified his silence at the trial, and stated that he had never doubted the outcome. Nine years later, in January 2008, Thorpe gave his first press interview in 25 years, to The Guardian. Referring to the affair he said: [...] "If it happened now I think the public would be kinder. Back then they were very troubled by it... It offended their set of values." [...] Thorpe died on 4 December 2014.|$|E

The article concludes that state and local action on climate change is motivated only in part by the federal government's failure to adopt a national climate regulatory program and hence is likely to continue and perhaps even intensify. While a cap and trade program is likely to preempt state regulation of emissions allowances, it is unlikely to preempt many of the climate initiatives being pursued.

40|$|The Forestry Project (FOR) at IIASA has {{produced}} a full carbon account (FCA) for Russia for 1990, together with scenarios for 2010. Currently, there are rather <b>big</b> <b>question</b> <b>marks</b> regarding the existing carbon accounts for Russia, and Russia {{is critical to the}} global carbon balance due to its size. IIASA {{is in a position to}} perform solid analysis of Russia because of the databases that the Institute has built over the years. FOR based this work on a comprehensive geographic information system comprising georeferenced descriptions of the environment and land of Russia, which in turn are based on a number of thematic, digitized maps and databases. For the Russian energy sector and other industrial sectors (except the forest industry), the project used emissions estimates from the recent IIASA study "Global Energy Perspectives" (1998). The project carried out a separate substudy for the Russian forest industry sector. According to FOR's estimate, the total fluxes (including energy and industry sectors) in Russia were a net source of 527 teragrams of carbon (Tg C) in 1990. To illustrate the possible development of the carbon pools and fluxes over the next 10 years, FOR developed three different scenarios for the period 1990 - 2010, reflecting different assumptions regarding Russia's GDP growth. According to these scenarios, Russia will continue to be a net source of carbon to the atmosphere with 156 - 385 Tg C in 2010, including the emissions from energy and other industrial sectors. However, analysis of the FCA also shows considerable uncertainties involved in the carbon accounting. These uncertainties exceed the calculated changes in the full flux balance for the period 1990 - 2010. At present, this raises grave questions regarding the reliability of any accounting system used to measure terrestrial ecosystems for compliance with the Kyoto Protocol. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{business-to-consumer}} market for digital audiovisual archiving services. In doing so we identify drivers, threats, and opportunities for new services based on audiovisual archives in the cultural heritage domain. By analyzing the market we provide insights into the preconditions for provision of fruitful and viable services that can be build upon these archives. Design/methodology/approach The research method takes the form of a case study, including literature search and interviews. For this research we adopt the STOF-framework for analyzing purposes. This framework consists of four components: a service component, a technological component, an organizational component, and a financial component (STOF). Findings The authors argue an imbalance between the different factors of the STOF-model in the Netherlands. First, the service domain in the Dutch audiovisual archive domain shows little knowledge about (potential) users and their needs regarding the archive. The service domain is therefore probably the <b>biggest</b> <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> in this market. Second, the technical component presents few impedances and is therefore least of an issue. Third, the organization component in terms of value network presents issues revolving around the nature of the cultural institution. Non-profit cultural organizations like Sound & Vision in the Netherlands are not naturally inclined towards business modeling around development of services. Fourth and last, the financial domain shows severe bottlenecks for unlocking the content regarding intellectual property. The clearing of copyrights is one of the main tasks of Images for the Future, but engulfs much time in the primary process. In sum, the study shows promising and problematic issues that arise in the field of developing audiovisual archive services. Research limitations/implications This is a one-case study, so no cross analysis with other cases was possible. Future work includes the investigation of user needs regarding audiovisual cultural heritage and possible services upon the archives. Originality/value This is one of the first studies that look into the factors in a particular domain that influence the viability of services by using a business model framework. This paper, therefore, extends the utilization of this framework (STOF-model) as it used as a method for the evaluation of a market and provides market insights. Also, the application on the audiovisual cultural heritage domain is quite novel. For practitioners regarding the development of audiovisual archive services the paper presents fresh insights in the configuration of the different business components of the services...|$|R

A speech bubble with a single <b>big</b> <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> (?) (often drawn by hand, not counted as part of the lettering) denotes confusion or ignorance.
