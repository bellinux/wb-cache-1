25|$|Upset, Midas {{strove to}} divest himself {{of his power}} (the Midas Touch); he hated the gift he had coveted. He prayed to Dionysus, <b>begging</b> <b>to</b> be {{delivered}} from starvation. Dionysus heard and consented; he told Midas to wash in the river Pactolus. He did so, and when he touched the waters the power passed into them, and the river sands changed into gold. This was an etiological myth that explained why the sands of the Pactolus were rich in gold.|$|E
25|$|The other {{settlers}} {{rushed into}} the cabin as the raiding warriors surrounded the house. They {{shut the door and}} aimed their weapons through cracks in the walls. Two of the men stood near the doorway with their weapons, and Hodges' weapon came into contact with Girty's chest causing him, and his group, to retreat into the woods. Young Dimmick, anxious to the point of <b>begging</b> <b>to</b> leave, was then dispatched to Hennepin by horseback for help. The men at the cabin expected Dimmick to be shot as soon as he rode off, but he crossed the open prairie unscathed. Dimmick made the 16 mile (25.7km) journey and arrived in Hennepin to report the attack.|$|E

As soon as she could walk, her mother said, she was following her about, book in hand, <b>begging</b> <b>to</b> be taught to read stories for herself. She read them soon to so much purpose that before she was five years old, she had finished the Bible, being rewarded by a polyglot Testament for the feat, and had also read Plutarch, which at every subsequent reading gave her an equal pleasure, and at seven, had mastered Racine in the original, upon which she began the study of Latin with her father.|$|E

25|$|Each day Hilde visits Anton's grave mentally {{talking to}} {{him as if he}} is still alive. One evening, as she is {{returning}} home, Hilde discovers that a black cat seems to be following her. The cat causes her to remember two distinct experiences from her past. The first is a memory from when she was a small child and had attempted to hide a stray cat in her bedroom. Her family was very poor and could not afford a pet, but she saved her table scraps for it anyway. One day as she was coming home, her father met her drunk in the doorway. After telling her he had snapped the cat's neck, he beat her harshly with a fly swatter. This first memory seeped into the second: her daughter, Erika, <b>begging</b> <b>to</b> keep a stray cat she had found. Anton had granted her wish, but the cat ruined the neighbors' gardens and Hilde was forced to drown it in the river.|$|E

500|$|Not all {{reviews of}} the season were positive. A.V.

He described the season as a [...] "weekly exercise in South Park schizophrenia", with some episodes faring better than others, although he said {{the first half of the}} season was generally strong. Josh Modell, also of the A.V.

500|$|After {{traveling}} to Florence, Mary Shelley wrote to Lady Mountcashell, praising Laurette's [...] "simplicity and frankness". By way of her mother, Laurette inquired after Mary's health and requested her presence. Mary Shelley invited Laurette {{to stay with}} her in Florence two months after the birth of Percy Florence, but the girl's mother could not bear to part with her. In early 1820, the group moved to Pisa and Claire became like an elder sister to Laurette, taking her to operas and the Carnival. In the summer, the group moved again, from Pisa to Livorno, and Mary Shelley began researching her historical novel Valperga. Throughout the summer, Claire wrote anxiously to Byron, <b>begging</b> <b>to</b> see Allegra. Believing that the Shelleys were careless parents who were {{responsible for the deaths of}} their children and concerned that the children were not receiving proper religious training, he consistently refused to let Claire see their daughter.|$|E
500|$|... "Mutt Romney Blues" [...] is a three-chord, {{acoustic}} Delta blues song. Drawing {{parallels between}} the Mitt Romney dog incident and his political [...] "plans and schemes", the song criticizes Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and is sung {{from the perspective of}} the Romney family's dog. Cooder was inspired by Al Sharpton's quote [...] "how he treated his dog tells you a lot about him", and found the dog to be [...] "a useful character... when you view it in the light of the blues. Like a servant, a yardman, someone very low in the social order. He's just <b>begging</b> <b>to</b> be let down [...]" [...] Bud Scoppa of Uncut characterizes the song as [...] "the musical equivalent of a political cartoon". [...] "Brother Is Gone" [...] is poignantly styled as a sad folktale and features a haunting mandolin riff, a rueful tone, and wounded vocals. Its lyrics attribute the conservative Koch Brothers to the Deal with the Devil myth, which Cooder adapted from Robert Johnson's [...] "Cross Road Blues". The lyrics cite their [...] "crossroads" [...] as [...] "the prairie town of Wichita", where Koch Industries is headquartered. He said in an interview that [...] "the only logical explanation for the Brothers I could come up with is, they made their deal at the crossroads with Satan." [...] AllMusic's Thom Jurek cites it as [...] "among the finest songs 's written." ...|$|E

500|$|Clive Russell, who portrayed Blackfish, {{spoke about}} working with Gwendoline Christie as Brienne of Tarth, noting [...] "There's {{something}} very curious, by the way, I'm probably about 6'6" [...] tall. I think she's about 6'3", but all the time I worked with her, I {{felt like she was}} taller than me. Now I don't really know what {{that has to do with}} it. It might be something to do with being confronted by a physically charismatic very tall woman, or maybe it's that she's caught the impressiveness of the character of that woman, that soldier. She's also an extraordinarily hilarious woman. We had great fun together. It was great fun to play." [...] Gwendoline Christie also spoke about filming with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who portrays Jaime Lannister, again, saying [...] "I was excited, It was really fun to be with Nikolaj again, and I thought the way of which their reunion happens is not really expected. I just loved that it was so formal, because within the confines of such formality, and having to negotiate with each other, there are so many other stories <b>begging</b> <b>to</b> be told in those moments. There's a slow process of creeping familiarity among two people who haven't been together for a long time; it was allowed to build." [...] Coster-Waldau also spoke about their first reunion scene, stating [...] "It's a great scene. These characters are so much about holding their cards so close to their chest and they don't want to reveal how they're feeling. But we know there's history between them, that this is more than two knights meeting. But they would never acknowledge that." ...|$|E

[...] Having led public sector unionism through a period where almost no workers {{had the right to}} strike, Little has been credited with bringing public sector unions [...] "from collective <b>begging</b> <b>to</b> collective bargaining."

2500|$|Quevedo's satire {{includes}} Sueños y discursos, {{also known}} as Los Sueños (1627; [...] "Dreams and Discourses"). Quevedo employed lots of word-play in this work, which consists of five [...] "dream-visions." [...] The first is [...] "The Dream of the Last Judgment", in which Quevedo finds himself witnessing the Day of Judgment, and closes with a glimpse of Hell itself. The second dream is [...] "The Bedeviled Constable" [...] in which constable is possessed by an evil spirit, which results in the evil spirit <b>begging</b> <b>to</b> be exorcised, since the constable is more evil of the two. The third dream is the long [...] "The Vision of Hell". The fourth dream-vision is called [...] "The World from the Inside". The last dream is [...] "The Dream of Death", in which Quevedo offers examples of man's dishonest ways.|$|E
2500|$|After Bach's {{death in}} 1750, his sons came into {{conflict}} {{and moved on}} in separate directions, going to live with other family members. [...] While Bach did everything to educate his sons, his daughters never went to school.

Anna Magdalena became increasingly dependent upon charity and handouts from the city council, ultimately relying on public <b>begging</b> <b>to</b> survive. Probably her only child or stepchild who provided any support to her was her stepson Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, whose letters show he provided regular financial assistance.

2500|$|Moskvin {{has stated}} that he felt great sympathy for the dead {{children}} and felt {{that they could be}} brought back to life by either science or black magic. He enclosed the remains in the dolls in an attempt to give them functional bodies to be used when he eventually discovered a way to bring them back to life, feeling that their physical remains were too decayed and ugly for them to feel comfortable or happy. Moskvin claims to have been aware that he was committing a crime, but felt the dead children were [...] "calling out" [...] to him, <b>begging</b> <b>to</b> be rescued. He believed that rescuing the children was more important than obeying the law. He was also motivated by his own desire to have children, specifically a daughter. Moskvin often regretted that he never had children and at one point attempted to adopt a young girl against the wishes of his parents, but his application was declined due to his low income. Moskvin denied any sexual attraction to the dolls and instead considered them to be his children. He would talk to and interact with the corpses, sing songs to them, watch cartoons with them, and even hold birthday parties and celebrate holidays for their benefit.|$|E
