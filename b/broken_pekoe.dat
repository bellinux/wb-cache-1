40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the total polyphenol content, antioxidant activity and antibacterial {{properties of the}} extracts of different Bangladeshi tea varieties such as flowery <b>broken</b> orange <b>pekoe,</b> <b>broken</b> orange <b>pekoe,</b> red dust and green tea. Methods: Total phenolic and flavonoid contents were determined by Folin–Ciocalteu and aluminum chloride colorimetric assay, respectively. The antioxidant capacity was determined by ferric ion reducing antioxidant power and phosphomolybdenum method. Antibacterial activity was evaluated by disc diffusion method in agar plate and subsequently, the minimum inhibitory concentration was determined by broth dilution method. Results: Total phenolic and flavonoid contents were significantly higher (P <  0. 05) in green tea compared to other three black tea varieties. The green tea also showed a higher free radical scavenging and antioxidant activities {{than all the other}} tea varieties tested (P <  0. 05). In addition, the extracts of all four tea varieties showed inhibitory activity against several pathogenic bacteria and also the same trend of higher antimicrobial activity of green tea than other tea varieties was observed. Conclusions: Taken together, {{the results of this study}} demonstrated that Bangladeshi tea, especially the green tea, may act as a substitute for natural antioxidants and as a promising antibacterial agent for beneficial influence in human health...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the antifungal potential of different grades of Sri Lankan orthodox black tea [orange <b>pekoe,</b> <b>broken</b> orange <b>pekoe</b> fannings (BOPF) and Dust No. 1] {{belonging to the}} three agro-climatic elevations (low, mid and high). Methods: Antifungal activity was assessed in vitro using methanolic extracts (300 µg/disc) and agar disc diffusion bioassay technique against three Candida species, Candida albicans (C. albicans), Candida glabrata (C. glabrata), and Candida tropicalis. ketoconazole and itraconazole mixture was used as positive control (10 µg/disc) and methanol {{was used as the}} negative control. The minimum inhibitory concentrations were also determined using standard protocols. Results: None of the extracts were effective against Candida tropicalis. Furthermore, orange pekoe grade tea belonging to all agro-climatic elevations did not induce any antifungal activity against C. albicans and C. glabrata as well. Conversely, Dust No. 1 belonging to all three agro-climatic elevations and low-grown BOPF showed moderate antifungal activity against C. albicans and C. glabrata. Interestingly, the severity of the antifungal effect varied with agroclimatic elevations. The minimum inhibitory concentrations ranged from 64. 00 – 128. 00 µg/mL against C. glabrata and 128. 00 - 256. 00 µg/mL against C. albicans. Conclusions: Sri Lankan Dust No. 1 and BOPF have marked antifungal activity in vitro and offer promise {{to be used as a}} supplementary beverage in prophylaxis and during drug treatment in candidiasis...|$|R
50|$|Flowery <b>Broken</b> Orange <b>Pekoe</b> from Dilmah's Kataboola Estate in the Nawalapitiya Region offers clean, black leaf, {{with some}} silvery tip. The infused leaf {{is clean and}} open, with a coppery tone {{indicative}} of a bright cup. The liquor shows character and depth, with some strength, but generally mellow for a very pleasing and bright tea. The liquor displays an orange brown hue {{in the style of}} an elegant Ceylon Tea. Tasting notes - Tightly rolled tea leaf that is matt brown-black in color with the occasional show of tip. The infused leaf is bright brown/burnt sienna in colour. Liquor color is mahogany with a greenish tinge. A fine tea with an aroma of light hay on the nose and a hint of pistachios and almonds in the taste. A fortifying tea with body and soul.|$|R
40|$|The {{rates of}} {{extraction}} of theaflavins from sieved Kapchorua Pekoe Fannings (600 – 710 μm) {{and from a}} Ceylon <b>Broken</b> Orange <b>Pekoe</b> Fine Leaf Blend have been measured at 80 °C {{with a set of}} aqueous salt and buffer solutions spanning the pH range 3 · 1 to 8 · 1. There was little effect on adding 1 : 1 electrolytes but considerable decreases in rate occurred in the presence of calcium chloride. The rate constants in acid buffers were the same as in a normal unbuffered infusion but in alkaline buffers of pH 8 they were over 50 % larger. This phenomenon was quantitatively accounted for by the partial dissociation of theaflavins at higher pH and the greater diffusion coefficient of the resulting ionic salt. The relevance of these findings to tea brewing and to industrial theaflavins extraction is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of theaflavins and of caffeine in sieved Kapchorua Pekoe Fannings (600 – 710 μm) have been determined at 80 °C {{with a range}} of aqueous salt and buffer solutions of ionic strength 0 · 11 mol dm− 3 and of pH 1 · 9 to 8 · 3. The caffeine concentration in the infusions and in the leaf, and its partition constant between swollen leaf and solution, was little affected by the presence of electrolytes or pH changes. The concentration of theaflavins in the infusions was not changed by the addition of salts but was considerably greater in acid media and also, temporarily, in borate buffers. The acid effect was corroborated by experiments with a Ceylon <b>Broken</b> Orange <b>Pekoe</b> blend. The most significant finding was that the concentration of theaflavins in the Kapchorua leaf rose markedly with falling pH while its partition constant decreased. These results show that hydrogen ions liberate extra theaflavin by breaking down the leaf structure and/or the bonding of some theaflavin within the leaf. The effect has significant commercial implications since the market price of tea leaf correlates with its theaflavin content...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the antibacterial properties of three grades of orthodox Sri Lankan black tea {{belonging to the}} three agro-climatic elevations. Methods: Methanloic extracts of orange <b>pekoe</b> (OP), <b>broken</b> orange <b>pekoe</b> fannings (BOPF) and Dust No. 1 belonging to three agro-climatic elevations (low, mid and high grown) were made and tested in vitro (concentration: 300 µg/disc) against Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) (S. aureus) and Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778) (B. cereus), and two Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027) (P. aeruginosa) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 35218) (E. coli), using agar disc diffusion assay. Gentamycin (10 µg/disc) {{was used as the}} positive control and methanol as the negative control. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were evaluated, using micro dilution method. Results: None of the tea extracts exerted an antibacterial action against P. aeruginosa and E. coli. In contrast mild to moderate antibacterial activity was exerted against S. aureus and B. cereus. Further gentamycin exhibited strong antibacterial activity against all the four bacterial species. Further low MIC values were evident for tea samples against the two Gram-positive bacteria. The order of anti-bacterial activity for tea extracts was Dust No. 1 > BOPF > OP. Conclusions: It is concluded that Sri Lankan orthodox black tea belonging to Dust No. 1, BOPF, and OP pocess in vitro antibacterial activity against S. aureus and B. cereus but not against Gram-positive bacteria P. aeruginosa and E. coli...|$|R
5000|$|The {{expensive}} hand-sorted, full-leaf {{versions of}} the tea like the Orange Pekoe (O.P.) are highly sought after at international auctions making it unaffordable for most locals. In November 2006 a Nilgiri Tea achieved [...] "Top Honours" [...] and fetched a world record price of $600 per kg. This was at the first ever tea auction held in Las Vegas. A machine-sorted, lower-cost variety of high quality tea is a semi-full leaf variety known as <b>Broken</b> Orange <b>Pekoe</b> (BOP). However, most production occurs via the Crush, Tear, Curl or CTC process of manufacture, which delivers a higher number of cups per measure (technically known as cuppage). The strong flavours of Nilgiri tea make it useful for blending purposes. At the same time, Nilgiri tea has suffered from poor reputation associated with its erstwhile reliance on sales to the former USSR. Soviet buyers had little regard for quality. In the 1990s the collapse of this trading partner triggered a substantial economic downslide in the Nilgiris district, which was further aggravated by various quality issues. In recent years the Tea Board of India has charged some producers of Nilgiri tea with fraudulently adulterating their product, and has closed some Bought Leaf Factories due to non-compliance with food safety regulations. Also {{with a view to}} improving product quality, the United Planters Association of South India and the Tea Board of India have instigated programs to change cultivation and harvest practices among small growers.|$|R
40|$|Background: Black tea [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze (family: Theaceae) ] {{has been}} used by Sri Lankan {{traditional}} practitioners to promote diuresis. However, the type and grade of tea is not specified. Materials and Methods: This study investigates the diuretic activity of black tea infusion (BTI) in rats using <b>Broken</b> Orange <b>Pekoe</b> Fannings (BOPF) grade from major agroclimatic elevations: high-, mid-, and low-grown. Different concentrations of BTI, furosemide (positive control), and water (vehicle) were orally administered to starved (18 h) male rats (n = 9 /group), then hydrated. Acute and chronic (28 days) diuretic activities were assessed by measuring cumulative urine output at hourly intervals for 6 h. Electrolyte levels (Na &#x 002 B;, K &#x 002 B;, Ca 2 &#x 002 B;, H &#x 002 B;, Cl &# 8722;, HCO 3 &# 8722;), pH, osmolarity of urine, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of treated rats were determined. Results: Administration of BTI induced a significant (P < 0. 05) and dose-dependent diuretic activity, which varied with the tea produced in different agroclimatic elevations. Diuretic activity had a rapid onset (1 st h), peaked at 2 nd h and maintained up to 4 th h (except the low dose). Furthermore, there was a dose-dependent increase in micturition frequency, which peaked at 2 nd h. A close association between the caffeine content of tea and diuretic activity was evident. BTI-induced diuresis was accompanied with an increased urine Na &#x 002 B; level and GFR. The diuretic activity of BTI was mediated via multiple mechanisms: inhibition of both aldosterone secretion (with increased Na &#x 002 B; /K &#x 002 B; ratio) and carbonic anhydrase [with decreased Cl &# 8722; /(Na &#x 002 B; &#x 002 B; K &#x 002 B;) ratio] and via thiazide type of diuretic action (evaluated with increased Na &#x 002 B; /Cl &# 8722; ratio). Conclusion: The Sri Lankan BOPF grade black tea possesses mild oral diuretic activity whose efficacy differs with the agroclimatic elevation of production. Furthermore, it supports the traditional claim that the black tea acts as a diuretic...|$|R
