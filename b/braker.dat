50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1920 the Board of Trustees voted to {{establish}} the <b>Braker</b> School of Business Administration with students to be admitted in September of 1920. A few weeks later the name was changed to the <b>Braker</b> School of Commerce. Several curricula were created which was intended to overlap with the undergraduate requirements. In his mind, Fletcher intended <b>Braker</b> to rival the Wharton School of Finance and at one time considered opening <b>Braker</b> to high school graduate. Cousen's ideas {{about the nature and}} proposed school changed over the years. His original idea was to offer a combined course of 6 years in both a liberal arts and professional degree. Additional confusion occurred with how the new school would fit in with Cousen's three part plan for the curriculum. Cousens and Fletcher went back and forth for four years and in the end no step was taken to implement the Trustee vote. In 1925 the Board of Trustees used Braker's estate to establish graduate teaching fellowships to broaden course offerings in the department of economics. These also assisted in the construction of <b>Braker</b> Hall in 1927. The <b>Braker</b> Fund continued to support the economics department until the 1960s.|$|E

40|$|When power system’s {{constitutional}} {{elements are}} dropping {{off by a}} falut, {{it is necessary to}} find and remove the cause of the fault, and to restore the power system except faulted elements, because of the reduction of blacked out area and to maintain stability of the power system. So, in such cases, the faulted elements must be found immediately. If we want to find the faulted elements at the dispatching center, we must infer them from the state of protective relays and circuit <b>brakers,</b> after the faulted elements have been removed from the energized power system. (we can not obtain the information of the sequence of these apparatus’ action owing to the communication system.) Although some reports have been published by which we can infer the faulted elements from the state of the protective relays, a redesigning of existing protective relays must be necessary for practical application of these logics. So, the author proposes the discriminative logic of faulted elements by which we can infer a faulted elements from the state of existing protective relays. In this paper, at first, the author proposes a discriminative logic of faulted elements by which we can infer the faulted elements from the digital information that is made from the state of existing protective relays and circuit <b>brakers</b> after the fault. Next, the author confirms that the proposed logic is very effective for practical application, by simulating the logic using the data of real complex faults which have happened in some electric utility...|$|R
40|$|I {{investigated}} the ground reaction forces (GRF), stride kinematics and metabolic cost of skateboarding on an instrumented treadmill. Superficially, skateboarding {{appears to be}} a hybrid of walking, running, and cross-country skiing. I hypothesized that the push-foot in skateboarding would exhibit a vertical GRF peak similar in shape to running but with a lower magnitude. Further I hypothesized that the push-foot would exhibit greater propulsive GRF than braking GRF. Regarding stride kinematics, I hypothesized that skateboarders would increase their stride length (sL) at faster speeds. Finally, I hypothesized that skateboarding would have a smaller metabolic cost compared to walking and running at comparable speeds. Subjects (9 males/ 2 females) skateboarded on a force-instrumented treadmill at 1. 00, 1. 25, 1. 50, 2. 00, 2. 50, 3. 00, 3. 50, and 4. 00 m*sec- 1, walked at 1. 25 m*sec- 1, and ran at 3. 0 m*sec- 1. Upon GRF analysis, I discovered two distinctly different groups of skateboarders: subjects who demonstrated a braking force (“brakers”) and subjects that did not (“non-brakers”). The peak vertical and horizontal GRF for <b>brakers</b> resembled running with half of the magnitude. Both groups showed decreased SF at faster speeds, but <b>brakers</b> used slower SF than non-brakers. Walking and skateboarding 1. 25 m*sec- 1 had the same metabolic cost at but at 3. 0 m*sec- 1, skateboarding required approximately half the metabolic cost of running. Skateboarding is a unique mode of locomotion, with two distinctly different forms, that allows a person to move at a running velocity with the GRF and metabolic cost of walking...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-In this paper, {{the relay}} {{coordination}} {{of a large}} scale industrial plant of which the electrical system {{is intended to be}} made reliable by establishing digital protection relays was examined. Own parameters of plant’s electrical equipments and different operating conditions shall be considered as a whole, when the relay coordination is planned. Moreover, critical conditions of operating and fault status shall be determined and essential trip shall be done by digital protection relays during the fault moment so as not to bring any damage to the plant. For these reasons, accurate selectivity studies are required to be made. In this context, these coordination studies which were also made for a part of plant previously, have been made for all units of plant via using PSS SINCAL ® program which includes in its own database all IEC 255 - 3, ANSI relays and <b>brakers</b> in the plant. As a result, optimum relay coordination was confirmed with the method of fault simulation. Keywords-Protection relays, relay coordination I...|$|R
