Each combination was designed to test for something, such as the effect of fluorine after B was implanted or the F damage before B was implanted.

Forward characteristics of SiC Schottky rectifiers follow thermionic emission theory and are relatively well understood.

In this paper we report the analysis and experimental results of both the forward and reverse char-acteristics of high-voltage SiC Schottky rectifiers. Ti and Ni Schottky rectifiers with <b>boron</b> <b>implant</b> edge termination were fabricated on n-type 4 H SiC samples. Ni Schottky rectifiers fabricated on a 13 -m thick 3 : 51015 cm 3 nitrogen doped epilayer have a current density of 100 A/cm 2 at approximately 2 V forward bias and a reverse leakage current density of less than 0. 1 A/cm 2 at a reverse bias of 1720 V. The reverse leakage current is observed to depend on device area, Schottky barrier height, electric field at the metal-semiconductor interface, and temperature (a decreasing temperature dependence with increasing reverse bias). In addition, the reverse leakage current magnitude is larger and the electric field dependence is stronger than predicted by thermionic emission and image-force barrier height lowering. This suggests the reverse leakage current is due to a combination of thermionic field emission and field emission.

40|$|The {{well-known}} {{edge effect}} due to conduction in the parasitic edge transistor at low gate voltages takes place when the threshold voltage is lowered at the device edges. A {{bump in the}} subthreshold characteristic then appears, which is detrimental to circuit performance. Several solutions have been proposed for SOI nMOSFETs, including (a) additional heavy dose <b>boron</b> <b>implant</b> at the edges followed by diffusion, and (b) specially designed SOI transistors such as edgeless devices or H-gate MOSFETs. However, these solutions are not applicable to gate-all-around (GAA) transistors due to their particular structure and fabrication process. In GAA devices, the entire active area is surrounded by the gate oxide and the gate electrode, which renders the use of edgeless structures impossible. Moreover, an oxidation step is performed in order to round the transistor edges, and gate oxide is grown all around the Si island.

40|$|We have {{initiated}} {{a study to}} extract concentration profiles of ultra shallow phosphorous implants in silicon complementing published work on ultra shallow <b>boron</b> <b>implant</b> profiles. There is an ever-increasing interest {{in the production of}} p-n junctions in silicon to create the new generations of ultra large scale integrated (ULSI) devices. Such junctions can be formed by implantation do pants (such as B, P, and As) at lowered energies. Development of design tools and process implementation both require that accurate methods be available for confirming absolute do pant profiles. Traditionally, profiles have been extracted through the use of secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS), nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) and electrical measurements such as spreading resistance profilometry. Results of ion implanted species can be checked by SIMS (J. G. M. van Berkum, et al Vac. Sci. Technol. B 16 (1998) 298). However, the analysis of ultra shallow implants by standard SIMS techniques is not straightforward and is weak in quantitative measurements. There are several reasons for this. First, standard methods of SIMS are hampered by limits on the instrumental sensitivity, which may not be adequate to examine very low-dose implants. Second, the accuracy in quantifying standard SIMS at very shallow depth is limited, due to an initial transitional region within which the sample composition equilibrates with the primary ion beam. This initial equilibration is characteristic of the SIMS technique, and is highly reproducible. Considerable effort has been expended in understanding the details of the equilibrium process, nevertheless, it is complicated even in the simplest of situations and continues to present problems for accurate quantification. Third, in specific situations high mass resolution required to separate the species of interest, or its proxy, from other mass groups, including impurity groups. Although there has been many investigations to extract quantitative profiles by SIMS using relative sensitivity factors (RSF), they can be reproduced 20 - 30 % under more controlled conditions (R. G. Wilson, S. W. Novak, J. Appl. Phys. 69 (1991) 466). However, {{there is a need for}} other methods to normalize SIMS results.   RBS is a candidate to calibrate SIMS profiles, but lacks the sensitivity to detect phosphorous due to the proximity of its mass with the masses of Si isotopes. Nuclear reaction analysis (NRA), 31 P(a,p) 34 S, is a suitable method for phosphorous detection. This nuclear reaction displays a resonance in the cross section at an incident energy near 5 MeV. While the cross section for the 31 P(a,p) 34 S reaction is small, we are able to measure the absolute do pant concentration of phosphorous implants into Si down to fluences of 1 ´ 1014 cm- 2. This opens a route to the calibration of TOF SIMS integrated profiles for P, which may then be used for analysis of the lower fluence regime. Two sets of phosphorous implanted silicon wafers were prepared. Phosphorous doses in our samples ranged from 1 ´ 1013 cm- 2 to 5 ´ 1015 cm- 2 with the implanted energy of 1 keV to 30 keV. To date, no evidence was found for self-sputtering based on these samples.   The alpha capture reaction on phosphorous has been investigated in the field of nuclear physics to find the nuclear energy level of different isotopes. This reaction has been used in profiling P in silicon, but none to P concentrations and P implanted energies as low as those reported here.

(100) Si wafers were implanted with 30 keV Ge+ implant at a dose of 1 x 1015 /cm 2 followed by a 500 eV B implant at a dose of 1 x 1015 /cm 2. The germanium implant produces an amorphous layer 480 Å thick and the <b>boron</b> <b>implant</b> is completely contained within the amorphous layer. The wafer was subsequently subjected to an impulse anneal at ramp rates between 50 °C/sec and 400 °C/sec to temperatures between 700 and 900 °C followed by a flash anneal to temperatures between 1100 °C and 1300 °C. The flash anneal occurred over a microsecond time scale so the ramp rates and the cooling rates {{are estimated to be}} 106 °C/sec. It was found that the ramp rate and temperature of the impulse pre-anneal has a remarkable effect on the final microstructure and sheet resistance of the implant. For the 760 °C pre-anneal impulse temperature, followed by a 1300 °C flash, decreasing the ramp rate of the impulse anneal from 400 °C/sec to 50 °C/sec increases the end of range defect density by 270 % while the sheet resistance increased from 613 to 704 ohms/square. As the impulse temperature is increased the effects of the impulse ramp rate appear to decrease. The changes in the electrical and microstructural properties of the Si imply that the relatively low temperature impulse conditions play an increasingly important role as the high temperature flash anneals become shorter.

The present paper shows the {{advantages}} of replacing the p/sup ++/ Si etch stop layer by a p/sup ++/ polysilicon layer. The etch rate of Tetramethylammoniunhydroxide (TMAH) is measured for LPCVD polysilicon and silicon doped with Boron at concentrations from 8. 10 /sup 18 / up to 4. 10 /sup 20 / atoms/cm/sup 3 / which is the Boron solubility limit into Si. TMAH etch being often used during back-end process, selectivity to aluminium is usually needed. The etch selectivity of various TMAH solutions for p/sup ++/ Si, p/sup ++/ Poly and aluminium have been measured, from 25 % to 5 % TMAH pure and mixed with silicon powder and ammonium persulfate. Contrarily to silicon, polysilicon is etched isotropically in TMAH solution which constitutes a great advantage when cavities with vertical walls have to be opened. Although the polysilicon etch rate {{is higher than the}} silicon one, the selectivity (doped/undoped) is the same for the both materials, allowing identical uses. Another great advantage of polysilicon is that it can be deposited at any process step and does not require clever epitaxy steps or wafer bonding as for silicon.

40|$|For {{the last}} 40 years a natural demand for faster, more complex, and therefore, more {{functional}} electronic systems, {{has been the}} fundamental {{driving force behind the}} miniaturisation of the complementary metal oxide semiconductor transistor. The formation of highly conducting, ultra-shallow, p-type junctions is a key component for the source/drain contact and extension regions of the p-channel metal oxide semiconductor transistor. However, the requirements are becoming increasingly more difficult to achieve as technology advances. In fact, new ways of achieving device improvements are being considered. One method currently being implemented within industry is a switch from bulk silicon substrates to silicon on insulator (SOI). Therefore, it is important for any new techniques to be SOI compatible. The most commonly used p-type dopant, boron, suffers from process related phenomena which hinders the creation of such shallow junctions. During annealing interstitial defects remaining from the implantation process impede the junction formation through a defect-dopant interaction, which reduces the electrical activation and enhances the junction depth - the exact opposite to what is required! This thesis studies a technique which generates an excess of vacancy defects (a vacancy is essentially a missing silicon atom). The vacancies counteract the effect via an interstitial-vacancy recombination mechanism, thus reducing their detrimental effect on the subsequent <b>boron</b> <b>implant.</b> A detailed investigation into the optimisation of such a technique has been achieved through Monte Carlo simulations and experimental studies on diffusion, electrical activation and lattice damage in bulk silicon and SOI. It has been shown {{that it is possible to}} optimise the boron and vacancy generating implants to achieve a near "diffusionless" process, producing a junction depth of around 17 nm, with an extremely high level of electrical activation (~ 5 x 1020 cm- 3) at low annealing temperatures. Furthermore, the junction is extremely thermally stable (600 - 900 °C) giving rise to a large process window for ease of integration. Overall, this optimised technique rivals competing processes with a much lower equipment cost and "footprint" making it potentially a highly viable alternative to the current preferred methodology within industry...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} the {{influence}} of implantation damage on emitter recombination is examined for both <b>boron</b> and phosphorus <b>implanted</b> emitters after thermal processing. Dominant defects are identified and used to describe observed changes in emitter saturation current, J 0, {{as a function of}} implant fluence. Recombination through defects is identified as the cause of increased J 0 compared with simulated values. For P-implanted samples J 0 n+ is shown to depend on annealing temperature for samples partially amorphised by a 1 × 1015 cm- 2 P implantation at 40 keV. J 0 n+ of samples completely amorphised by a 3 × 1015 cm- 2 phosphorus implant show much reduced dependence on annealing temperature. For <b>boron</b> <b>implanted</b> samples annealed at 1000 °C, J 0 p+ was found to be below 25 fA. cm- 2 for implant fluence less than 5 × 1014 cm- 2 but to increase significantly for high fluence, where defects such as boron-interstitial clusters and dislocation loops are likely to dominate the observed recombination...|$|R
40|$|<b>Boron</b> ions were <b>implanted</b> {{into high}} {{resistivity}} Si wafers at energies in the 15 - 50 MeV range and doses in the 10 (11) - 10 (16) cm- 2 range. The {{distribution of the}} implanted ions was analyzed by spreading resistance profilometry and for the high fluences by secondary ion mass spectrometry. Some samples were implanted with the beam normal to the wafer surface to study the channeling effect in a pure electronic stopping power regime of slowing down. The experimental measurements of the projected ranges and of the stragglings are compared with calculations based on the usual LSS and Bethe-Bloch formulas for the stopping power. This classic approach justifies quantitatively the distribution for the samples implanted in a random direction. The I-V characteristic of a diode performed by multiple energy <b>boron</b> <b>implants</b> of 15, 22 and 50 MeV is presented. The obtained breakdown voltage, 5 x 10 (3) V, represents a possible application of the high energy implants...|$|R
40|$|For the {{creation}} of p-type transistor junctions, this project tries to ascertain if {{other members of the}} halide group are as successful as fluorine when implanted in compound form with boron into a crystalline silicon substrate. A series of <b>boron</b> halide <b>implants</b> were performed, consisting of boron di-fluoride, boron di-chloride, boron di-bromide and also the monomer boron, all to a boron fluence of 2 x 1014 ions/cm 2 and 1015 ions/cm 2. In parallel with the processing of the heat treated implanted samples using the Hall effect method, a literature survey was generated. This entailed searching for and reading through appropriate literature, then collating a compendium of the salient aspects within the 'boron implanted into silicon' domain. The processing of samples encompasses wafer cleaving, thermal treatment, patterning of the sample with the van de Pauw pattern by photolithography, isolation etching and Hall effect measurements. A limited portion of the boron bromide material was analysed by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), enabling a view of the as-implanted and heat treated silicon substrate condition. For the <b>boron</b> halide <b>implants,</b> the results show that after thermal treatment the atomic mass of the halide atoms is generally inversely proportional to the level of boron activation. In addition to processing and analysis of <b>boron</b> halide <b>implants,</b> the design and manufacture of an automated sample processing machine was undertaken, enabling safer and more accurate etching of samples. In brief, this dissertation provides Hall effect data for <b>boron</b> halide <b>implants</b> into crystalline silicon, along with a specimen of additional data obtained from RBS and SIMS measurements...|$|R
