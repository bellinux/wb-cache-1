A secondary analysis of extant data resulted in a final sample size of 13, 619 respondents who represented 847, 253 active-duty military personnel. Multivariate models were fitted to examine the association between patterns of drinking and individual reasons for the inability to deploy. ^ Logistic regression showed no association of <b>binge</b> or heavy <b>drinking</b> to greater inability to deploy. Interestingly, individual reasons for the inability to deploy did show an association to include: Training, Dental Issue, No HIV Test, and Family Situation. There was no association noted for the individual reasons: Injury, Illness, Leave/Temporary Duty, or Other. Binge and heavy drinkers appear to be more susceptible to the psychosocial determinants than physical determinants as reasons for the inability to deploy. ...|$|R

5|$|Women develop {{long-term}} {{complications of}} alcohol dependence {{more rapidly than}} do men. Additionally, women have a higher mortality rate from alcoholism than men. Examples of long-term complications include brain, heart, and liver damage and {{an increased risk of}} breast cancer. Additionally, heavy drinking over time has been found to {{have a negative effect on}} reproductive functioning in women. This results in reproductive dysfunction such as anovulation, decreased ovarian mass, problems or irregularity of the menstrual cycle, and early menopause. Alcoholic ketoacidosis can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of <b>binge</b> <b>drinking.</b> The amount of alcohol that can be biologically processed and its effects differ between sexes. Equal dosages of alcohol consumed by men and women generally result in women having higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), since women generally have a higher percentage of body fat and therefore a lower volume of distribution for alcohol than men, and because the stomachs of men tend to metabolize alcohol more quickly.|$|E

Risk is greater in younger people due to <b>binge</b> <b>drinking</b> which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine. Long-term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, alcoholic dementia, heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, peptic ulcers and sexual dysfunction, and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, malabsorption, alcoholic liver disease, and cancer. Damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from sustained alcohol consumption. A wide range of immunologic defects can result and there may be a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.|$|E

Impairments in spatial working memory and pattern recognition tasks also {{have been found in}} heavy binge drinkers. Impulse control is also impaired in binge drinkers, especially female binge drinkers. Additionally, immediate and delayed recall of verbal and visual information is impaired; conversely, semantic organizational ability is better in binge drinkers compared to non-binge drinkers. Studies in adolescents have shown that regular <b>binge</b> <b>drinking</b> may cause long-lasting cognitive impairments, though the threshold needed to produce significant effects remains unclear. Cognitive impairment in adults is also unclear, as one study found no association between <b>binge</b> <b>drinking</b> and cognitive impairment. <b>Binge</b> <b>drinking</b> is believed to increase impulsivity due to altered functioning of prefrontal–subcortical and orbitofrontal circuits. <b>Binge</b> <b>drinking</b> and alcoholics who have undergone multiple detoxifications is associated with an inability to interpret facial expressions properly; this is believed to be due to kindling of the amygdala with resultant distortion of neurotransmission. Adolescents, females and young adults are most sensitive to the neuropsychological effects of <b>binge</b> <b>drinking.</b> Adolescence, in particular early adolescence, is a developmental stage that is particularly vulnerable to the neurotoxic and neurocognitive adverse effects of <b>binge</b> <b>drinking</b> due to it being a time of significant brain development.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background While alcohol-related {{health and}} social {{problems}} amongst youths are increasing internationally, both consumption and associated harms are particularly high in British youth. Youth <b>drinking</b> patterns, including <b>bingeing,</b> frequent <b>drinking</b> and drinking in public spaces, are associated with increased risks of acute (e. g. violence) and long-term (e. g. alcohol-dependence) health problems. Here we examine economic, behavioural and demographic factors that predict these risky drinking behaviours among 15 – 16 year old schoolchildren who consume alcohol. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among schoolchildren in North West England (n = 10, 271) using an anonymous questionnaire delivered in school settings. Analysis utilised logistic regression to identify independent predictors of risky drinking behaviour. Results Of all respondents, 87. 9 % drank alcohol. Of drinkers, 38. 0 % usually <b>binged</b> when <b>drinking,</b> 24. 4 % were frequent drinkers and 49. 8 % drank in public spaces. Binge, frequent and public drinking were strongly related to expendable income and to individuals buying their own alcohol. Obtaining alcohol from friends, older siblings and adults outside shops were also predictors of risky drinking amongst drinkers. However, being bought alcohol by parents was associated with both lower <b>bingeing</b> and <b>drinking</b> in public places. Membership of youth groups/teams was in general protective despite some association with bingeing. Conclusion Although previous studies have examined predictors of risky drinking, our analyses of access to alcohol and youth income have highlighted eradicating underage alcohol sales and increased understanding of children's spending as key considerations in reducing risky alcohol use. Parental provision of alcohol to children in a family environment may also be important in establishing child-parent dialogues on alcohol and moderating youth consumption. However, this will require supporting parents to ensure they develop only moderate drinking behaviours in their children and only when appropriate. </p...|$|R
25|$|<b>Binge</b> <b>drinking</b> is {{associated}} with a profound social harm, economic costs as well as increased disease burden. <b>Binge</b> <b>drinking</b> is more common in males, during adolescence and young adulthood. Heavy regular <b>binge</b> <b>drinking</b> {{is associated}} with adverse effects on neurologic, cardiac, gastrointestinal, hematologic, immune, musculoskeletal organ systems as well as increasing the risk of alcohol induced psychiatric disorders. A US-based review of the literature found that up to one-third of adolescents binge-drink, with six percent reaching the threshold of having an alcohol-related substance use disorder. Approximately one in 25 women binge-drinks during pregnancy, which can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. <b>Binge</b> <b>drinking</b> during adolescence {{is associated with}} traffic accidents and other types of accidents, violent behavior as well as suicide. The more often a child or adolescent binge drinks and the younger they are the more likely that they will develop an alcohol use disorder including alcoholism. A large number of adolescents who binge-drink also consume other psychotropic substances.|$|E
25|$|A {{recent study}} {{conducted}} on an American College tested to discover if excessive <b>binge</b> <b>drinking</b> {{would have an}} effect on the cardiovascular system.

The study suggests that binge drinkers with a past history of strong <b>binge</b> <b>drinking</b> should be screened regularly.|$|E
25|$|Extreme <b>binge</b> <b>drinking</b> {{can lead}} to brain damage faster and more {{severely}} than chronic drinking (alcoholism). The neurotoxic insults are due to very large amounts of glutamate which are released and over-stimulate the brain as a binge finishes. This results in excitotoxicity, a process which damages or kills neurons (brain cells). Each <b>binge</b> <b>drinking</b> episode immediately insults the brain; repeat episodes result in accumulating harm. The developing adolescent brain {{is thought to be}} particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of <b>binge</b> <b>drinking,</b> with some evidence of brain damage occurring from drinking more than 10 or 11 drinks once or twice per month. With prolonged abstinence neurogenesis occurs which can potentially reverse the damage from alcohol abuse.|$|E
