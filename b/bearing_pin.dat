40|$|The use of {{ultrasonic}} {{phased array}} (UPA) technology for {{inspection of the}} trunnion <b>bearing</b> <b>pin</b> of the 100 -year old Salmon Bay Bascule Bridge {{is the focus of}} this research. To thoroughly investigate the <b>bearing</b> <b>pin,</b> two main objectives are addressed: the development of a UPA system, including the design of a case that uses a Poly Methyl Meth Acrylate (PMMA) material to house the transducer, and the implementation of the system in the field to test the feasibility of the UPA system and its application as a nondestructive testing unit. Two different testing settings are carried out in this research. The first study is performed in a lab-based setting on a mock-up model pin. This model is used as a reference to provide the calibration of the UPA system using the exterior edge, two keyholes, and three diagonal interior grease holes. The second study is performed in a field-based setting on the authentic trunnion <b>bearing</b> <b>pin</b> taken out of service from the Salmon Bay Bridge in Seattle, Washington, currently residing at the Riverside Campus. This pin has three similar diagonal holes, keyholes, and unknown internal defects. Realtime measurements using the UPA system is used to identify the exterior surfaces and the keyholes of the original pin. The results of the inspection of the pins using the UPA system indicate the accuracy of the real-time data taken from the probe measurements. It was limited to seeing perpendicular defects and exterior sides, and could not identify the diagonal grease hole within both pin parts. It did, however, identify the keyholes, and was later verified by visual inspection once the sleeves were removed. The original pin showed no internal defects. For future research in nondestructive testing used in historic trunnion pins, it is recommended to combine this technology with an automatic system that allows the reduction of human interaction with the inspection. A membrane-like surface adaptable to rough faces, along with a constant flow of water between the wedge and surface, would facilitate the need to remove the PMMA case out of the pin to re-apply couplant for inspections. Finally, a modified angled wedge could also be applied within the PMMA case to search for different angled cracking...|$|E

In this research, these components failed during operation. Detail analysis of the failed surface showed that the failure in connecting rod and crank <b>pin</b> <b>bearing</b> was caused by improper lubrication system. Evidence of improper lubrication system was proved by the existence of black scratch and chipping on crank <b>pin</b> <b>bearing</b> which formed by high friction during operation.

40|$|The thermoelastic {{analysis}} of a load <b>bearing</b> <b>pin</b> joint has an intricate aspect associated to it. The mixed boundary condition of partial contact and separation at the pin-plate interface, {{in the presence of}} heat flow and varying bearing load, can lead to mathematical difficulties such as non-existence of solutions and physical ambiguities such as non-uniqueness of contact configurations in certain load ranges. The {{analysis of}} these systems, where temperature field and contact areas are mutually interdependent, need special care in handling as the configuration achieved can become dependent on loading history. This aspect in relation to a two-dimensional model consisting of a rigid smooth misfit pin in a large isotropic elastic plate under combined pin bearing load and on-axis unidirectional heat flow is investigated, the key role being played by the thermal expansion of the pin and the step model for thermal conductance at partial pin-plate interfacial contact...|$|E
40|$|Aircraft {{are often}} {{designed}} with numbers determined by testing in a lab, {{rather than by}} repeatedly building prototypes. These lab tests conform to testing specifications so that the numbers can be compared between manufacturers, suppliers, and lab technicians. One such specification is ASTM specification E 238 – 84 (08), and {{it is used to}} determine important properties of a <b>bearing</b> <b>pin</b> joint like hinges, bolt holes, and rivet joints. The properties determined from this fastener-through-plate method are bearing strength, bearing yield strength, and bearing stiffness. Adhering to the methods outlined in ASTM E 238, a study was performed, looking at the effects that plate material, fastener used, fastener lubrication, and plate hole preparation method (whether drilled and reamed or just drilled) have on the three bearing joint properties. The plate materials used were Al 7050 – T 7451, Ti – 6 Al – 4 V (mill annealed), and PH 13 – 8 Mo – H 1000. The fasteners were Ti – 6 Al – 4 V screws, coated A 286 screws, and high speed steel (HSS) pins used as a control. Lubrication was tested using a corrosion inhibitor, PR – 1776 M B – 2 from PRC – DeSoto, on the fastener or leaving the fastener uncoated. The HSS pins were always tested in the uncoated condition. 54 runs were performed, as outlined by a D-optimal design of experiment. It was discovered from the statistical analysis of the results via ANOVA that both the plate material used and the pin material, whether a screw or a pin, had a significant effect on the bearing strength, bearing yield strength, and bearing stiffness. The interaction between the two factors was also significant on all responses but the bearing stiffness. PH 13 – 8 Mo – H 1000 plates seemed to perform best on average, followed by Ti – 6 Al – 4 V plates, then Al 7050 – T 7451 plates. PH 13 – 8 Mo – H 1000 and Ti – 6 Al – 4 V plates had similar bearing strength and bearing yield strength averages with the HSS control pins being used, which had the highest mean values for a given plate and fastener. The Ti – 6 Al – 4 V and A 286 screws behaved and performed statistically similar in most cases, except when hole preparation method was take into account. The Ti – 6 Al – 4 V screws performed better when the hole was drilled and reamed, while the coated A 286 screws performed better when the hole was drilled only. All screws had lower resulting bearing properties than the HSS control pins. It was also found that ASTM specification E 238 – 84 (08) is a precise test method, since the method could be performed repeatably and reliably with no missing data points. Therefore, this ASTM testing method is reasonable for determining bearing properties, which can then be used to design aircraft...|$|E

Approaches in different hitch dynamometers are explained and pros and cons are mentioned. Also main parts and functional principle of draft sensor are clarified. The main goal {{of this research is}} clarification and examination of draft sensor output signal on angular draft force dependences. Utilization of draft sensor as a source for draft force sensing in lower arms is intended and examined. Research was focused on loading of draft sensor in different directions for proper screening of voltage output. Special loading device was designed and used with respect of real mounting conditions and force loading identically to <b>bearing</b> <b>pins</b> of tractor hitch lower arms. With usage of calibrated load cell and National instrument sensing control unit stage loading diagram of draft sensor was obtained. Results show basic feedback of voltage output on force load angle variation. In non-load condition, voltage output fluctuates around 5 V. In the main direction of draft force application voltage drop occurs from 5 V up to 3. 16 V. Reverse direction of loading brings the voltage output increment from 5 V up to 7. 06 V. When the load is applied with angular inclination voltage output changes are diminished up to 90 ° and draft sensor shows voltage output symmetry against the main axis. Based on stage loading diagram the appropriateness of draft sensor usage in design of universal three point hitch dynamometer is discussed in paper summary.
