5|$|After departing New Richmond, {{the tornado}} moved {{on toward the}} northeast, {{continuing}} along a course almost parallel to the Omaha Railroad line, with most of its destruction after that point confined to rural areas, with only two fatalities occurring north of town. The tornado struck several farms in the Stanton area, passing barely a mile north of the village of Deer Park before crossing into Polk County. The storm came within two miles of the village of Clear Lake, {{proving to be a}} great scare for its residents as it reminded many of a similar tornado which struck Clear Lake in September 1884. A large number of farms in the area suffered considerable damage, and many families were left homeless. One farmer, Sam Olson was killed instantly when the tornado flattened his farmstead, leaving his wife and son gravely injured. Northeast of Clear Lake, the tornado tore through the logging community of Pineville, where another farmer, Michael Kennetz, was killed when his home was swept away. Several homes and farms {{in the vicinity of the}} hamlet of Richardson and the village of Clayton were blown away, leaving several families destitute. The storm continued east into <b>Barron</b> <b>County,</b> where the farming community of Arland sustained a direct hit, with virtually the entire settlement being demolished, but no fatalities or serious injuries being reported. The tornado dissipated a few miles southwest of the city of Barron, although the storm was still strong enough to cause a considerable amount of damage to the town.|$|E

5|$|The 1899 New Richmond Tornado was an {{estimated}} EF5 tornado which formed {{on the early}} evening of June 12, 1899 and tore a 45-mile long path of destruction through St. Croix, Polk and <b>Barron</b> <b>counties</b> in west-central Wisconsin, leaving 117 people dead, twice as many injured and hundreds homeless. The worst devastation wrought by the tornado was at the city of New Richmond, Wisconsin, which took a direct hit from the storm. Over half the town was left in ruins by the tornado, which also caused lesser damage to several other communities in the area. More than $300,000 (USD) ($ in today's dollars) in damage was reported. Today, it ranks as the ninth deadliest tornado in United States history, {{as well as the}} deadliest ever recorded in Wisconsin.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} 18 - 25 year old male and female persons, living within the <b>Barron</b> and Dunn <b>County</b> residency limits, and the knowledge about their partner, {{as well as the}} happiness and importance levels of their own marital and parental expectations. The study also examines any differences between the male and female gender as well as the two different age groups of 18 - 21 and 22 - 25. A survey rating the knowledge, happiness and importance levels of these 18 - 25 year olds provides the data for this study. (The total number of surveys completed was 328; 4 were removed because of age and 155 were removed because they were not in a committed relationship- leaving 169 usable surveys). The study was undertaken to determine if there were meaningful levels of knowledge, as well as happiness and importance between these 18 - 25 year olds and their marital and parental i expectations. A statistically significant relationship was found between the knowledge, happiness and importance levels for the two genders- males and female- and the two age groups of 18 - 2 1 and 22 - 25. More research is recommended to expand the lack of current research of this study and illuminate both {{the reliability and validity of}} the instrument used. Further study would also clarify more about the relationship between the knowledge, happiness and importance levels of 18 - 25 year olds and their marital and parental expectations.
