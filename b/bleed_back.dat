5000|$|The floppy {{controller}} {{is unusually}} flexible. It can {{read and write}} raw bit sequences directly from and to the disk via DMA or programmed I/O at 500 (double density) or 250 kbit/s (single density or GCR). MFM or GCR were the two most commonly used formats though in theory any run-length limited code could be used. It also provides a number of convenient features, such as sync-on-word (in MFM coding, $4489 is usually used as the sync word). MFM encoding/decoding is usually done with the blitter — one pass for decode, three passes for encode. Normally the entire track is read or written in one shot, rather than sector-by-sector; this {{made it possible to}} get rid of most of the inter-sector gaps that most floppy disk formats need to safely prevent the [...] "bleeding" [...] of a written sector into the previously-existing header of the next sector due to speed variations of the drive. If all sectors and their headers are always written in one go, such bleeding is only an issue {{at the end of the}} track (which still must not <b>bleed</b> <b>back</b> into its beginning), so that only one gap per track is needed. This way, for the native Amiga disk format, the raw storage capacity of 3.5 inch DD disks was increased from the typical 720 KB to 880 KB, although the less-than-ideal file system of the earlier Amiga models reduced this again to approximately 830 KB of actual payload data.|$|E
50|$|The next {{main event}} was between A.J Styles and Christopher Daniels combating in a Last Man Standing match. The match was first stalled by Daniels but soon {{turned into a}} {{physical}} fight between Styles and Daniels with action taken to ringside. As the fight returned inside the ring, Styles went wild on Daniels with a variation of strikes till he sent Daniels {{to the corner of}} the ring, where Daniels cut off a charging Styles with a boot to the face. After an array of moves attempted on an unfolded chair set up by Daniels in the ring, Daniels dropped Styles with a ura-nage back-first across the chair, taking over the match effectively from there. The match returned to the outside where Daniels smashed Styles head-first into the steel steps causing him to <b>bleed.</b> <b>Back</b> inside the ring, Styles countered a chair shot and connected with a springboard flying forearm smash that sent the chair into Daniels' face. Relentlessly, Styles pursued Daniels on the outside, sending Daniels head-first into the steps which resulted in bloodshed while Styles continued on the beat down. The fight relocated up the entrance ramp to the stage. Styles went for the Styles Clash, but Styles playing up to the audience allowed Daniels to counter with a back body drop. Daniels taking the lead didn't last as Styles later leaped off a section of the set to perform a springboard moonsault into an inverted DDT drop. The referee started to count Daniels out as Styles got to his feet just when Kazarian emerged and pushed Styles off the stage, assisting his partner Daniels. However, the referee only counted to 9 before Styles got back to his feet. Daniels pursued and rammed Styles into the nearby guardrail and then brought a table to the scene from under the ring and placed it below the stage. Daniels tried to go for the Angel's Wings from off the ramp only to be shoved into Kazarian by Styles. Styles capitalized by hitting the Pelé kick and then grabbed Daniels to hit the Styles Clash off the ramp and through the table below. Moments later, Daniels tried to get up and answer the 10 count unsuccessfully, as Styles made it to his feet before the 10 count to win the match.|$|E
40|$|There are {{now three}} {{independent}} {{observations of the}} CO 2 polar cap mass budget of Mars' north polar cap. The first is based elevation changes detected by the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) on the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS). The second is based on MGS Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) broadband observations of the solar and infrared radiation fields {{at the top of}} the atmosphere. The third is based on neutron counts measured by the neutron spectrometer (NS) on Odyssey. The TES data are based on an energy balance. The net radiative loss (gain) in a column is balanced by latent heating due condensation (sublimation) of CO 2. In calculating the mass budget, the other main energy sources, atmospheric heat transport and subsurface conduction, were neglected. At the pole, atmospheric heat transport is indeed a small term. However, subsurface heat conduction can be significant because at the North Pole water ice, which has a high thermal conductivity compared to bare soil, is a dominant component of the subsurface. Thus, heat conducted down into the ice during summer will slowly <b>bleed</b> <b>back</b> out during fall and winter reducing the amount of CO 2 that condenses on the pole. We have taken a first cut at quantifying this effect by fitting a curve to Paige's estimates of the conducted energy flux in his analysis of Viking IRTM data...|$|E

40|$|Background : The {{function}} of the coronary arteries is to transport oxygenated blood to the heart muscle and if these arteries have been clogged due to fat plaque, patient has to undergo coronary angiography to determine the narrowing rate of coronary arteries and for this purpose, the left femoral artery is used. The aim {{of this research is}} to study the effect of pressure bandaging in reducing <b>bleeding,</b> bruising, <b>back</b> pain and groin pain in the patients undergoing coronary angiography. Materials and Methods: This quasi-experimental study was carried out on 100 patients undergoing coronary angiography in surgical and CCUwards of Shahid Rajaee hospital of Tehran and Khorramabad Shahid Madani hospital. Subjects were randomized to receive a pressure bandage(no= 50) or sand bag(no= 50) after manual compression of the femoral artery puncture site. Results: The patients without pressure bandages had a higher incidence of bleeding and bled earlier(p< 0 / 05) after catheter removal than the patients with bandages. The incidence and extent of bruising was the same in both groups of patients with sandbags experienced a higher incidence of back and groin pain. Conclusion: Thus, regarding the associated increase in patients, comfort, and delay in time of onset of bleeding, pressure bandages could be used routinely in the management of patients after coronary angiography...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: After {{coronary}} angiography to prevent potential complications, patients {{are restricted to}} 4 - 24 hours bed rest in the supine position due to the complications. This {{study was designed to}} assess the effect of changing position and early ambulation on low back pain, urinary retention, bleeding and hematoma after cardiac catheterization. Methods: In this clinical trial, 140 patients by using a convenience sampling randomly divided into four 35 -individual groups. The patients in the control group were in the supine position for 6 hours without a movement. Change position was applied to the second group (based on a specific protocol), early ambulation was applied to the third group and both early ambulation and change position were applied to the fourth group. Then, severity of <b>bleeding,</b> hematoma, <b>back</b> pain and urinary retention were measured at zero, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours after angiography. The data was collected through an individual data questionnaire, Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) of pain and Kristin Swain’s check list was applied to evaluate the severity of bleeding and hematoma. Results: None of patients developed vascular complications. Incidence of urinary retention was higher in the control group, although this difference was not significant. The mean of pain intensity in the fourth and sixth hours showed a significant difference. Conclusion: Based on the findings of this study, changing patients’ position can be safe and they can be ambulated early after angiography...|$|R

By no power cm earth can his indurated understanding be penetrated by the truth that his woful state is due, not to any laws of his own, nor to any lack of them, but to his rascally refusal to obey the Golden Rule. How long is it since we were all clamoring for the Australian ballot law, which was to make a new Heaven and a new earth?

We must subdue our detestable habit of shaking hands with prosperous rascals and fawning upon the merely rich. It is not permitted to our employers to plead in justification of low wages the law of supply and demand that is giving them high profits. It is not permitted to discontented employees to break the bones of contented ones and destroy the foundations of social order. It is infamous to look upon public office with the lust of possession; it is disgraceful to solicit political preferment, to strive and compete for [...] "honors" [...] that are sullied and tarnished by the touch of the reaching hand. Until we amend our personal characters we shall amend our laws in vain. Though Paul plant and Apollos water, the field of reform will grow nothing but the figless thistle and the grapeless thorn. The State is an aggregation of individuals. Its public character is the expression of their personal ones. By no political prestidigitation can it be made better and wiser than the sum of their goodness and wisdom. To expect that men who do not honorably and intelligently conduct their private affairs will honorably and intelligently conduct the affairs of the community is to be a fool. We are told that out of nothing God made the Heavens and the earth; but out of nothing God never did and man never can, make a public sense of honor and a public conscience. Miracles are now performed but one day of the year--the twenty-ninth of February; and on leap year God is forbidden to perform them.|$|R
