5|$|On 12 July the Soviets {{launched}} Operation Kutuzov, their counter-offensive {{upon the}} Orel salient, which threatened the flank and rear of Model's 9th Army. The 12th Panzer Division, thus far held in reserve and slated to <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> the northern {{side of the}} Kursk salient, along with the 36th Motorized Infantry, 18th Panzer and 20th Panzer Divisions were redeployed to face the Soviet spearheads.|$|E
5|$|May's {{squadron}} {{was attached}} as a direct-reporting unit {{to the newly}} promoted General Twiggs' 1st Texas Division, which was to <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> {{the north side of}} Monterrey. On September 21, Taylor launched his attack on the city, but failed to synchronize his two forces. Poor Mexican leadership allowed the Americans to avert disaster, and after some intense urban fighting, General Ampudia offered Taylor an eight-week ceasefire that was highly favorable to the Mexicans. Taylor accepted, which caused President James K. Polk, furious at the agreement, to transfer most of his forces to Winfield Scott.|$|E

The bonds, which were linked {{to the price of}} gold, were certificates held under a trust mortgage with the Chatham Phenix National Bank and Trust Company. Prospective purchasers of the bonds were told that Horch and an associate guaranteed payment of principal and interest personally and that the income from rentals was expected far to exceed expenses, including both interest costs and amounts to <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> the sinking fund.|$|E

He was arrested on 5 May 1950, and held in the notorious Sighet prison (alongside three of his brothers — Ștefan Tătărescu included — and his former collaborator Bejan). His son Tudor, who was living in Paris, suffered from schizophrenia after 1950, and had to <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> an institution (where he died in 1955). Sandra Tătărescu Negropontes was also imprisoned in 1950, and released three years later, upon the death of Joseph Stalin.|$|E
5|$|College {{football}} {{maintained a}} tradition of postseason bowl games. Each bowl game {{would be associated with}} a particular conference, and earning a spot in a bowl game was the reward for winning a conference. This arrangement was profitable, but it tended to prevent the two top-ranked teams from meeting in a true national championship game, as they would normally <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> the bowl games of their respective conferences. Several systems have been used since 1992 to determine a national champion of college football. The first was the Bowl Coalition, in place from 1992 to 1994. This was replaced in 1995 by the Bowl Alliance, which gave way in 1997 to the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). The BCS arrangement proved to be controversial, and was replaced in 2014 by the College Football Playoff (CFP).|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{skepticism}} in the West, the new Soviet leader {{proved to}} <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> reversing the Soviet Union's deteriorating economic condition instead of continuing {{the arms race}} with the West. Partly {{as a way to}} fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms, Gorbachev simultaneously introduced glasnost, or openness, which increased freedom of the press and the transparency of state institutions. Glasnost was intended to reduce the corruption {{at the top of the}} Communist Party and moderate the abuse of power in the Central Committee. Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet citizens and the western world, particularly with the United States, contributing to the accelerating détente between the two nations.|$|E

5|$|Dominica having {{fallen to}} Monckton's forces in June, the British then set their {{sights on the}} French stronghold of Martinique. Britain's Secretary of State for the Southern Department, Sir William Pitt, {{concluded}} that Martinique's capture would be the decisive battle {{for control of the}} Caribbean, and instructed that all available resources <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> its invasion. An army of 13,000 troops was assembled, supported by a fleet under Admiral George Rodney. Levant was added to Rodney's sizeable command in late 1761 and sailed as part of the expedition in January 1762. She was present when the British landings commenced but is not recorded as having engaged with enemy forces either there or in the subsequent French defeat at Fort Royal between 25 January and 3 February.|$|E
5|$|In June 1999, the {{contract}} to jointly develop and produce the Chengdu FC-1/Super 7 was signed. The project {{was to be a}} 50:50 partnership; the air forces of both countries would <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> ordering the fighter. After GEC-Marconi had abandoned the bidding to supply an integrated avionics suite, FIAR and Thomson-CSF proposed a number of avionics suites based on the Grifo S7 and RC400 radars respectively, despite previously hoping to use the PAF's Super 7 to launch its new Blue Hawk radar. Because of sanctions placed on Pakistan after the country's 1998 nuclear weapons tests, design work progressed very slowly over the next 18 months, preventing delivery of the Western avionics to the PAF. In early 2001, the PAF decided to decouple the airframe from the avionics, enabling design work on the aircraft to continue. As the airframe was developed, any new avionics requirements by the PAF could be more easily integrated into the airframe.|$|E
5|$|Towards 15:00, {{after hours}} of resistance, the Russian army was in dire straits, but the French forces were {{exhausted}} and had neither the necessary stamina nor the necessary will to carry out another assault. At this crucial juncture, Murat's chief of staff, General Augustin Daniel Belliard rode straight to the Emperor's Headquarters and, according to General Ségur who wrote {{an account of the}} campaign, told him that the Russian line had been breached, that the road to Mozhaysk, behind the Russian line, was visible through the gaping hole the French attack had pierced, that an enormous crowd of runaways and vehicles were hastily retreating, and that a final push would be enough to decide the fate of the Russian army and of the war. Generals Daru, Dumas and Marshal Louis Alexandre Berthier also joined in and told the Emperor that everyone thought the time had come for the Guard to <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> battle.|$|E

5|$|Two clubs still {{experienced}} financial problems, however. The Phoenix Coyotes eventually {{filed for}} bankruptcy in May 2009. The league then took control over the team later that year in order to stabilize the club's operations, with the hopes of eventually reselling it to a new owner who would <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> stay in the Phoenix market. The league did not find a satisfactory buyer for the Coyotes until 2013. The financially struggling Atlanta Thrashers were eventually sold to True North Sports and Entertainment in 2011, who then relocated the team to Winnipeg, a stark reversal of the league's Southward expansion {{more than a decade}} earlier.|$|E
5|$|While {{producers}} Broccoli and Saltzman originally sought Cary Grant for the role, they discarded {{the idea}} as Grant would <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> only one feature film, and the producers {{decided to go}} after someone who {{could be part of}} a series. Richard Johnson has claimed to have been the first choice of the director, but he turned it down because he already had a contract with MGM and was intending to leave. Another actor purported to have been considered for the role was Patrick McGoohan on the strength of his portrayal of spy John Drake in the television series Danger Man: McGoohan turned down the role. Another potential Bond included David Niven, who would later play the character in the 1967 parody Casino Royale.|$|E
5|$|However, Nosanchuk {{was still}} not certain that he would attempt to defend Lamb on mental grounds. In Ontario at that time, a {{defendant}} found not guilty under these terms remained imprisoned indefinitely unless an order for his release came from the province's Executive Council, acting {{on the advice of}} a Review Board including a Supreme Court Judge. Yaworsky warned Nosanchuk that even if he used an insanity defence and won, Lamb would probably <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> an institution for the criminally insane for life. It was still possible for the lawyer to approach the prosecution and propose a plea bargain, offering to plead guilty to non-capital murder, which would result in life imprisonment for Lamb but allow a parole hearing after 10 years. In any case, Nosanchuk could not use the case he had prepared unless he first received unequivocal written instruction from his client to plead insanity. Having been given a week by his counsel to consider the matter, Lamb wrote to Nosanchuk that he wished to attempt a mental disorder defence. The boy made clear his understanding that if he were found not guilty under these terms, the state still had the right to detain him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

5|$|The AN {{comprised}} one {{battalion of}} infantry of 1,000men hurriedly enlisted in Sydney, plus 500naval reservists and ex-sailors who {{would serve as}} infantry. The 1st Battalion, AN was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Russell Watson, while the naval reservists were formed into six companies under Commander Joseph Beresford. Also included were two machine gun sections, a signals section and a medical detachment. Another battalion of militia from the Queensland-based Kennedy Regiment—which had been dispatched to garrison Thursday Island—also contributed 500volunteers. Recruitment began on 11 August, with the {{very few of the}} infantry having had previous military experience. Under the overall command of Colonel William Holmes, the force departed Sydney on 19 August aboard HMAS Berrima and halted at Palm Island off Townsville until a New Zealand force, escorted by the battlecruiser HMAS Australia, cruiser HMAS Melbourne and the French cruiser Montcalm, occupied Samoa on 30 August. The AN then moved to Port Moresby, where it met the Queensland contingent already aboard the transport Kanowna. The force sailed for German New Guinea on 7 September, although Kanowna was left behind when her stokers refused to work. The militia were also left in Port Moresby after Holmes decided they were not sufficiently trained or equipped to <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> the anticipated fighting.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{planned to}} launch the {{invasion}} on 1 May 1944. The initial draft of the plan was accepted at the Quebec Conference in August 1943. General Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed commander of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF). General Bernard Montgomery was named as commander of the 21st Army Group, which comprised all of the land forces involved in the invasion. On 31 December 1943 Eisenhower and Montgomery first saw the plan, which proposed amphibious landings by three divisions with two more divisions in support. The two generals immediately insisted that {{the scale of the}} initial invasion be expanded to five divisions, with airborne descents by three additional divisions, to allow operations on a wider front and speed up the capture of Cherbourg. The need to acquire or produce extra landing craft for the expanded operation meant that the invasion had to be delayed to June. Eventually, thirty-nine Allied divisions would <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> the Battle of Normandy: twenty-two American, twelve British, three Canadian, one Polish, and one French, totalling over a million troops all under overall British command.|$|E
