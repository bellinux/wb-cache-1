40|$|Non-aureus staphylococci (NAS), a {{heterogeneous}} group {{of a large}} number of species and subspecies, are the most frequently isolated pathogens from intramammary infections in dairy cattle. Phylogenetic relationships among <b>bovine</b> NAS <b>species</b> are controversial and have mostly been determined based on single-gene trees. Herein, we analyzed phylogeny of <b>bovine</b> NAS <b>species</b> using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 441 distinct isolates. In addition, evolutionary relationships among bovine NAS were estimated from multilocus data of 16 S rRNA, hsp 60, rpoB, sodA, and tuf genes and sequences from these and numerous other single genes/proteins. All phylogenies were created with FastTree, Maximum-Likelihood, Maximum-Parsimony and Neighbor-Joining methods. Regardless of methodology, WGS-trees clearly separated <b>bovine</b> NAS <b>species</b> into 5 monophyletic coherent clades. Furthermore, there were consistent interspecies relationships within clades in all WGS phylogenetic reconstructions. Except for the Maximum-Parsimony tree, multilocus data analysis similarly produced 5 clades. There were large variations in determining clades and interspecies relationships in single gene/protein trees, under different methods of tree constructions, highlighting limitations of using single genes for determining bovine NAS phylogeny. However, based on WGS data, we established a robust phylogeny of <b>bovine</b> NAS <b>species,</b> unaffected by method or model of evolutionary reconstructions. Therefore, it is now possible to determine associations between phylogeny and many biological traits, such as virulence, antimicrobial resistance, environmental niche, geographical distribution, and host specificity...|$|R

40|$|Concomitantly with an {{outbreak}} of fatal anaplasmosis in a cattle herd in Switzerland in 2002, we detected two <b>bovine</b> hemoplasma <b>species</b> in diseased animals: Mycoplasma wenyonii (formerly Eperythrozoon wenyonii) and a second, novel <b>bovine</b> hemoplasma <b>species</b> later designated "Candidatus Mycoplasma haemobos" (synonym, "Candidatus Mycoplasma haemobovis"). The second species was characterized by a shorter 16 S rRNA gene. The aims {{of the present study}} were to provide a detailed molecular characterization of this species, to develop specific quantitative real-time PCR assays for the two <b>bovine</b> hemoplasma <b>species,</b> and to apply these assays in order to evaluate the prevalence and clinical significance of the hemoplasmas. Sequencing of the near-complete 16 S rRNA gene of the second hemoplasma revealed that it was 94 % identical to that of Mycoplasma haemofelis, an anemia-inducing feline hemoplasma species, but less than 85 % identical to that of the bovine hemoplasma M. wenyonii. Using the newly developed assays, a total of 159 animals from the anaplasmosis outbreak were reexamined. In addition, we tested 57 clinically ill and 61 healthy Swiss cattle, as well as 47 calves. Both hemoplasmas were highly prevalent in adult cattle but occurred rarely in calves. Animals from the herd with the fatal anemia outbreak were more frequently infected with M. wenyonii and exhibited higher M. wenyonii blood loads than animals with unrelated diseases and healthy animals.

An independent study of mitochondrial DNA and autosomal markers confirmed these secondary contacts (with an estimate of up to 10% of bovine ancestry in the modern wisent genome) leading the authors to go further in their conclusions by proposing the wisent to be a hybrid between steppe bison and aurochs with an hybridization event originating before 120,000 years ago.This {{is also consistent with}} the apparent Bos origin of the mitochondrial DNA.|$|E

5000|$|Amenable {{species is}} a term used {{within the context of}} USDA’s meat and poultry {{inspection}} program to signify exotic species (livestock and fowl not covered by the statutes) that might be added to the laws and thus be eligible for mandatory federal inspection, which is taxpayer-funded. An exotic species is considered an amenable species if its anatomy and biology are substantially the same as the animals currently inspected. The Poultry Products Inspection Act (P.L. 85-172, as amended; 21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.) was expanded in 2001 to cover ostrich, rhea, and emu (ratites) because USDA determined that the hazards they present to food safety are essentially the same as those posed by chickens, turkeys, ducks, etc., and the existing contamination detection and prevention systems are sufficient to control them. Buffalo have been considered for inclusion under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) because they are <b>bovine</b> <b>species</b> (like cattle). Deer and elk, on the other hand, are cervids, and pose hazards for food safety that are not yet fully known or controlled for under the existing meat inspection system.
