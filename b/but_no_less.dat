25|$|From {{the start}} of the war in 1939 until VE Day, several of Canada's Atlantic coast ports became {{important}} to the resupply effort for the United Kingdom and later for the Allied land offensive on the Western Front. Halifax and Sydney, Nova Scotia, became the primary convoy assembly ports, with Halifax being assigned the fast or priority convoys (largely troops and essential material) with the more modern merchant ships, while Sydney was given slow convoys which conveyed bulkier material on older and more vulnerable merchant ships. Both ports were heavily fortified with shore radar emplacements, search light batteries, and extensive coastal artillery stations all manned by RCN and Canadian Army regular and reserve personnel. Military intelligence agents enforced strict blackouts throughout the areas and anti-torpedo nets were in place at the harbor entrances, making a direct attack on those facilities unfeasible due to the impossibility for Germany to provide air support. Even though no landings of German personnel took place near these ports, there were frequent attacks by U-boats on convoys departing for Europe once these had reached the mouth of the St. Lawrence. Less extensively used, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> important, was the port of Saint John which also saw matériel funneled through the port, largely after the United States entered the war in December 1941. The port's location within the protected waters of the Bay of Fundy made it a difficult target for attack. The Canadian Pacific Railway mainline from central Canada (which crossed the state of Maine) could be used to transport in aid of the war effort.|$|E

On the other hand, Cawkwell concludes that [...] "Epaminondas must be judged not in relation to these inevitable limitations of Boeotian power.

500|$|Dara Gellman, an {{independent}} Canadian video artist, used the kiss sequence in [...] "Rejoined" [...] {{as the basis}} of her 3-minute 1999 project alien kisses. In this piece, the kiss scene is manipulated—the video is slowed, the image enlarged and digitized—and trance music is added. New media scholar Carolyn Guertin argues that this serves to make the footage [...] "even more alien", presenting queerness as [...] "unearthly". Jean Bruce argues that, despite the inherent ambiguity of the scene in the episode, [...] "the image is still one of two women kissing, which opens up the possibilities of queer desire on its own terms". Similarly, Guertin argues that Gellman translates the (not truly queer) scene into an [...] "expression of gay love that is alien and apart, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> erotic for being so". In using the scene in isolation, alien kisses, Bruce argues, [...] "strips away the gender equivocation by imposing a new queer vision". She suggests that alien kisses works as an [...] "antidote" [...] to the [...] "ultimately tame treatment" [...] Star Trek has offered of queer themes, and as a [...] "suggestion" [...] that Star Trek acknowledge the desires of queer viewers and fans [...] "beyond the occasional titillating episode".|$|E
