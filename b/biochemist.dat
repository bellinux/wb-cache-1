5|$|Rudolf Vrba (11 September 1924– 27 March 2006) was a Slovak-Jewish <b>biochemist</b> who, as a {{teenager}} in 1942, was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp in German-occupied Poland. He became known for having escaped from the camp in April 1944, {{at the height of the}} Holocaust, and for co-writing a detailed report about the mass murder that was taking place there. Distribution of the report is credited with having halted the mass deportation of Hungary's Jews to Auschwitz in July 1944, saving over 200,000 lives. After the war Vrba became a noted <b>biochemist</b> in England and Canada.|$|E

5|$|In 1985 <b>biochemist</b> David Dolphin {{proposed}} {{a link between}} the rare blood disorder porphyria and vampire folklore. Noting that the condition is treated by intravenous haem, he suggested that the consumption of large amounts of blood may result in haem being transported somehow across the stomach wall and into the bloodstream. Thus vampires were merely sufferers of porphyria seeking to replace haem and alleviate their symptoms.|$|E
5|$|On , a {{group of}} European citizens, led by German <b>biochemist</b> Otto Rössler, filed a suit against CERN in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

5|$|On April 5, 1952, <b>biochemist</b> Durey Peterson and {{microbiologist}} Herbert Murray at Upjohn {{published the}} first report of a fermentation process for the microbial 11α-oxygenation of steroids in a single step (by common molds of the order Mucorales). Their fermentation process could produce 11α-hydroxyprogesterone or 11α-hydroxycortisone from progesterone or Compound S, respectively, which could then by further chemical steps be converted to cortisone or 11β-hydroxycortisone (cortisol).|$|E

5|$|Photons {{can also}} be absorbed by nuclei, atoms or molecules, {{provoking}} transitions between their energy levels. A classic example is the molecular transition of retinal (C20H28O), {{which is responsible for}} vision, as discovered in 1958 by Nobel laureate <b>biochemist</b> George Wald and co-workers. The absorption provokes a cis-trans isomerization that, in combination with other such transitions, is transduced into nerve impulses. The absorption of photons can even break chemical bonds, as in the photodissociation of chlorine; this is the subject of photochemistry.|$|E
5|$|Although bottle pool's origins remain obscure, tournament {{records and}} {{newspaper}} articles {{confirm that the}} game has been played {{since at least the}} late 19th century. A mention appears in an 1894 New York Times newspaper article announcing a 64 player tournament to be played at a certain Hanover Clubhouse in Brooklyn, New York. The game was more well known in the early-to-mid-20th century, during which references to it appear in numerous books and publications including Sinclair Lewis's Main Street. It is also known to have been played by some notable individuals, such as world-renowned quantum chemist and <b>biochemist</b> Linus Pauling.|$|E
5|$|Before 1995, no peer-reviewed {{studies had}} been {{published}} investigating the safety of genetically modified food using human or animal feeding trials. In 1995 the Scottish Agriculture Environment and Fisheries Department commissioned a £1.6 million three-year research study to assess the safety of genetically engineered Desiree Red potatoes. The potatoes had been developed by <b>biochemist</b> John Gatehouse at Cambridge Agricultural Genetics (later renamed Axis Genetics) and had recently completed two years of field trials at Rothamsted Experimental Station. The GNA gene from the Galanthus (snowdrop) plant was inserted into the potato, allowing the GNA lectin protein to be synthesised. This lectin {{has been shown to}} be toxic to some insects.|$|E

5|$|In the {{run up to}} the {{commissioning}} of the LHC, Walter L. Wagner (an original {{opponent of}} the RHIC), Luis Sancho (a Spanish science writer) and Otto Rössler (a German <b>biochemist)</b> expressed concerns over {{the safety of the}} LHC, and attempted to halt the beginning of the experiments through petitions to the US and European Courts. These opponents assert that the LHC experiments have the potential to create low velocity micro black holes that could grow in mass or release dangerous radiation leading to doomsday scenarios, such as the destruction of the Earth. Other claimed potential risks include the creation of theoretical particles called strangelets, magnetic monopoles and vacuum bubbles.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} debates as {{to the nature of}} Van Gogh's illness and its effect on his work, and many retrospective diagnoses have been proposed. The consensus is that Van Gogh had an episodic condition with periods of normal functioning. Perry was the first to suggest bipolar disorder in 1947, and this has been supported by the psychiatrists Hemphill and Blumer. <b>Biochemist</b> Wilfred Arnold has countered that the symptoms are more consistent with acute intermittent porphyria, noting that the popular link between bipolar disorder and creativity might be spurious. Temporal lobe epilepsy with bouts of depression has also been suggested. Whatever the diagnosis, his condition was likely worsened by malnutrition, overwork, insomnia and alcohol.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Chadwick {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} become the Master of Gonville and Caius College. The job was prestigious but ill-defined; the Master was the titular head of the College, but authority actually resided in a council of 13 fellows, of whom one was the Master. As Master, Chadwick strove to improve the academic reputation of the college. He {{increased the number of}} research fellowships from 31 to 49, and sought to bring talent into the college. This involved controversial decisions, such as hiring in 1951 the Chinese <b>biochemist</b> Tien-chin Tsao and the Hungarian-born economist Peter Bauer. In {{what became known as the}} Peasants' Revolt, fellows led by Patrick Hadley voted an old friend of Chadwick's off the council and replaced him with Bauer. More friends of Chadwick's were removed over the following years, and he retired in November 1958. It was during his mastership that Francis Crick, a PhD student at Gonville and Caius College, and James Watson discovered the structure of DNA.|$|E

It celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 1980 and hosted the joint meeting with the Federation of Asian and Oceanian <b>Biochemists</b> (FAOB) held in Bangalore. The Society provides a forum for <b>biochemists</b> to meet and discuss their work.

5|$|In {{the realm}} of modern research, the late British <b>biochemist</b> and {{historian}} of Chinese science Joseph Needham (1900–1995) (known as Li Yuese in China) did extensive research and analysis of Su Song's texts and various achievements in his Science and Civilization in China book series. Joseph Needham also related many detailed passages from Su's contemporary medieval Chinese sources {{on the life of}} Su and his achievements known in his day. In 1956, John Christiansen reconstructed a model of Su Song's clocktower in a famous drawing, which garnered attention in the West towards 11th-century Chinese engineering. A miniature model of Su Song's clock was reconstructed by John Cambridge and is now on display at the National Science Museum at South Kensington, London. In China, the clocktower was reconstructed to one-fifth its actual scale by Wang Zhenduo, who worked for the Chinese Historical Museum in Beijing in the 1950s.|$|E

Olivia visits Raul's wife Susan Lugo (Rosa Arredondo) and claims to have met her before as well, but Susan does not {{remember}} their meeting. She says the only people at a meeting Olivia describes were Raul, Susan, and John Scott (Mark Valley). Olivia realizes that she apparently still has his memories inside of her head, and is mixing them up with her own. Over at Massive Dynamic, Nina Sharp's (Blair Brown) attempts to delve into Scott's memories for information hit a dead end {{when they find out}} that crucial pieces of his memories are missing; they soon discover that the memories they need are in Olivia's mind.|$|E

In 1935 American <b>biochemist</b> and virologist Wendell Meredith Stanley examined the tobacco mosaic virus and found it to be mostly made from protein. A short time later, this virus was separated into protein and RNA parts. A problem for early scientists was {{that they did not know}} how to grow viruses without using live animals. The breakthrough came in 1931, when the American pathologist Ernest William Goodpasture and Alice Miles Woodruff grew influenza and several other viruses in fertilised chickens' eggs. Some viruses could not be grown in chickens' eggs, but this problem was solved in 1949 when John Franklin Enders, Thomas Huckle Weller and Frederick Chapman Robbins grew polio virus in cultures of living animal cells. Over 5,000 species of virus have been discovered.|$|E
