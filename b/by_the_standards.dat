5|$|A {{series of}} concerts, lectures and {{recitals}} called the Glastonbury Festivals was established with a summer {{school in the}} town of Glastonbury between 1914 and 1926 by classical composer Rutland Boughton (1878–1960), and with their location attracted a bohemian audience <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of the time. They featured works by then-contemporary composers, sponsored by the Clark family, as well as a wide range of traditional works, from Everyman to James Shirley's Cupid and Death.|$|E

5|$|Bruce's {{earnings}} from his offices {{had made him}} a wealthy man, even <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of his patrons. This wealth allowed him to purchase the Balcaskie estate in 1665, and to extend the house and gardens. In 1675 he purchased the larger estate of Loch Leven, Kinross, from the Earl of Morton, which brought him the hereditary sheriffdom of Kinross-shire. In the late 1670s Bruce took on his first architectural projects for entirely new houses.|$|E
5|$|Bryan {{believed}} that he could, if nominated, unite the disaffected behind a strong silver campaign. However, part of his strategy was to remain inconspicuous until the last possible moment at the convention. He sent letters to national convention delegates, urging them to support silver, and enclosing copies of his photograph, writings, and speeches. Jones points out that though Bryan's speaking engagements were not deemed political <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of 1896, by modern measurements he was far more active in campaigning for the nomination {{than most of the}} better-known candidates.|$|E

5|$|Distinctive {{features}} of Ehrhardt include an 'A' with gently curving bar matching the centre-link of the 'B', a wide 'T' with spreadeagled serifs {{on either side}} and a 'b' with no foot on the left. In italic the 'J' has a crossbar, the 'w' has sharp reverse curves towards the top and left, and the 'v' has a flourish on the left. The face has high stroke contrast (difference between thick and thin strokes) <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of most old-style serif fonts. In order to allow compact line spacing, descenders were kept reasonably short.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{grew up to}} be {{tall and}} muscular, and was {{considered}} good looking <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of the period. He had a reputation as a competent public speaker and was known for his generosity to his household staff. Unusually, he enjoyed rowing, as well as hedging and ditching, and enjoyed associating with labourers and other lower-class workers. This behaviour was not considered normal for the nobility of the period and attracted criticism from contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|For all its success, by the 1920s Argentina {{was not an}} industrialized country <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of Britain, Germany or the United States. A major {{hindrance}} to full industrialisation was {{the lack}} of energy sources such as coal or hydropower. Experiments with oil, discovered in 1907, had poor results. Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales, the first state-owned oil company in Latin America, was founded in 1922 as a public company responsible for 51% of the oil production; the remaining 49% was in private hands.|$|E

5|$|In 1912 the Davis Library {{was added}} to the campus with space for 5,000 volumes. Although a major improvement, its {{atmosphere}} was inhospitable <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of later generations. Stacks were locked to students, for example, and the librarian's office was located {{at the entrance to the}} stacks to maximize control over entry. Decisions about book selections and the library's program were in the hands of an all-male faculty committee instead of the female librarian.|$|E
5|$|Isabella {{was only}} 12 {{years old at}} the time of her wedding, young <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of the period, and Edward {{probably}} had sexual relations with mistresses during their first few years together. During this time Edward fathered an illegitimate son, Adam, who was born possibly as early as 1307. Edward and Isabella's first son, the future Edward III, was born in 1312 amid great celebrations, and three more children followed: John in 1316, Eleanor in 1318 and Joan in 1321.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{initially}} had a garrison {{of eight}} gunners, five soldiers and a lieutenant, {{under the command}} of a captain. In the late 1540s, it was heavily armed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of the time, with 36 pieces of artillery. In the 1580s, the castle caught fire and the timber needed for the repairs required 127 trees to be sent from the New Forest. The work was carried out in 1584, prompted by the threat of a Spanish invasion, but by that time its garrison had shrunk to eight men.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} received {{money from}} the Crown to support the prisoners, with the amount varying on rank: the governor received 19 livres a day for each political prisoner – with conseiller-grade nobles receiving 15 livres – and, {{at the other end}} of the scale, three livres a day for each commoner. Even for the commoners, this sum was around twice the daily wage of a labourer and provided for an adequate diet, while the upper classes ate very well: even critics of the Bastille recounted many excellent meals, often taken with the governor himself. Prisoners who were being punished for misbehaviour, however, could have their diet restricted as a punishment. The medical treatment provided by the Bastille for prisoners was excellent <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of the 18th century; the prison also contained a number of inmates suffering from mental illnesses and took, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of the day, a very progressive attitude to their care.|$|E

Perhaps ironically, {{in view of}} its later eclipse, this made Irene the most financially lucrative work Johnson had yet written: {{during this period of}} his career, only the Dictionary earned him more money.|$|E

The Mansion House Scott Memorial Fund closed at £75,000 (2009 approximation £5.5million). This was not equally distributed; Scott's widow, son, mother and sisters received a total of £18,000 (£1.3 million). Wilson's widow got £8,500 (£600,000) and Bowers's mother £4,500 (£330,000). Edgar Evans's widow, children, and mother received £1,500 (£109,000) between them.|$|E
5|$|The three-cent nickel piece {{initially}} circulated well, {{but became}} less popular when the five-cent nickel {{was introduced in}} 1866, a larger, more convenient coin, with a value of five cents better fitting the decimal system. After 1870, most years saw low annual mintages for the three-cent nickel, and in 1890 Congress abolished it. The last were struck in 1889; many were melted down to coin more five-cent pieces. The issue is not widely collected, and prices for rare dates remain low <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of American collectible coinage.|$|E
5|$|A {{supporter}} of the evangelical wing of the Church of England, Wilberforce believed that the revitalisation of the Church and individual Christian observance {{would lead to a}} harmonious, moral society. He sought to elevate the status of religion in public and private life, making piety fashionable in both the upper- and middle-classes of society. To this end, in April 1797, Wilberforce published , on which he had been working since 1793. This was an exposition of New Testament doctrine and teachings and a call for a revival of Christianity, {{as a response to the}} moral decline of the nation, illustrating his own personal testimony and the views which inspired him. The book proved to be influential and a best-seller <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of the day; 7,500copies were sold within six months, and it was translated into several languages.|$|E
