Global analysis reveals double <b>Benioff</b> <b>zones</b> in 30 segments, including all 16 subduction zones investigated, with varying subducting plate ages and stress orientations, which implies that they are inherent in subducting plates.

40|$|The {{content and}} {{distribution}} of water is {{a critical factor in}} determining mantle properties, especially in the low-velocity and <b>Benioff</b> <b>zones.</b> Estimated temperature distributions vary widely, depending on assumptions regarding the relative significance for heat transfer of conduction, radiation, and convection. Comparison of estimated geotherms with known or inferred phase relationships in the system peridotite-eclogite-water provides information about the possible physical state of the mantle at various depths for comparison with geophysical measurements. Water is stabilized in minerals such as amphibole and phlogopite in the upper mantle; at greater depths, it may exist as intergranular fluid probably adsorbed on mineral surfaces, or it is dissolved in interstitial silicate magma. The most satisfactory explanation for the low-velocity zone involves incipient melting due to traces of water. Water rising from the deep mantle in preferred zones would augment the interstitial silicate magma {{at the base of the}} low-velocity zone, initiating the diapiric uprise necessary for basaltic magma generation. A petrological model for the suboceanic mantle suggests that a lens of gabbro-rich material may account for the gravity anomaly and seismic refraction measurements at mid-oceanic ridges. A petrological model for the area beneath island arcs suggests that the seismic low-velocity zone should not be continuous across it. Magma may be generated beneath island arcs by partial fusion of down-going oceanic crust by frictional heating, by migration of water from the lithosphere into overlying mantle, or by diapiric uprise of material from the downgoing lithosphere. Diapiric uprise could be initiated by influx of water into the layer including; the mantle-upper lithosphere boundary over a down-going slab. The composition of the liquid generated depends on many variables, including the water content and the stability of hydrous minerals.

It is concluded that the Rinjani calc-alkaline suite, which in many respects is typical of many suites erupted by circum-pacific volcanoes, probably originated by partial melting of the peridotite mantle-wedge overlying the active <b>Benioff</b> <b>Zone</b> beneath Lombok Island. The Pleistocene-Recent calcalkaline suite from the active volcano, Rinjani is composed of a diverse range of lavas. These include: ankaramite, high-Al basalt, andesite, high-K andesite and dacite.

Using linear multivariate regression, coupling is correlated with two variables: convergence rate and lithosphere age. Secondary correlations within the data set are penetration depth versus lithosphere age, and lateral extent versus convergence rate. Taken together, the observed correlations suggest a simple qualitative model where convergence rate and lithosphere age determine the horizontal and sinking rates, respectively, of slabs: these parameters influence the seismic coupling in the subduction zone.

40|$|The {{deformation}} of subducted oceanic lithosphere is revealed by detailed {{studies of the}} distribution of seismicity in <b>Benioff</b> <b>zones</b> and by the increasingly well-resolved images of the upper mantle obtained by seismic P-wave tomography. By using numerical experiments based on a simplified dynamical model of a subducted lithospheric slab, we test the idea that the observed {{deformation of}} the subducted slab results from a balance between internal buoyancy forces and the viscous stresses associated with deformation. The simplified model assumes that the lithosphere has uniform physical properties, it is denser and much more viscous than the upper mantle, and its penetration below 670 km depth is resisted by a step-like density increase at that level. The primary determinant of the style of deformation is the buoyancy number, F, a ratio of buoyancy stress generated by the mass anomaly in the slab to the stress associated with viscous deformation at a strain rate U,/L, defined in terms of subduction rate U, and slab thickness L. For a small buoyancy number, deformation of the slab is dominated by viscous flexure. For large F, down-dip extension of the slab appears to dominate, and a buckling instability of the slab is observed if there is resistance t...|$|R

40|$|It {{is useful}} to assess the global data sets that are most {{relevant}} to plate tectonics. Below {{are a series of}} global maps that help to confirm various aspects of plate tectonic theory. Plate boundaries are classified as ridges, transform faults, or subduction zones based on basic observations of topography (Figure 1) and seismicity (Figure 2). Remarkably, nearly all seafloor spreading ridges lie at a depth of 2500 - 3000 m below sea level which is the level of isostasy for hot thin lithosphere. Depths gradually increase away from the ridges because of cooling and thermal contraction so old ocean basins are commonly 4500 - 5000 m deep. Fracture zones and aseismic ridges also show up on these maps. Global seismicity (magnitude> 5. 1 Figure 2) highlights the plate boundaries and reveals their tectonic style. Shallow normal-faulting earthquakes (< 30 km deep) are common along slow-spreading ridges but largely absent along faster-spreading ridges where the plates are too thin and weak to retain sufficient elastic energy to generate large earthquakes. Transform faults are characterized by relatively shallow (< 30 km) strike-slip earthquakes and they are common along both fast- and slow-spreading ridges. The deeper earthquakes (green and blue dots in Figure 2) occur only in subduction zones where sheets of seismicity (i. e., <b>Benioff</b> <b>zones)</b> are critical evidence that relatively cold lithosphere i...|$|R
40|$|The {{regional}} geoid of {{the southwest}} Pacific is matched reasonably well by results from {{a model of the}} upper mantle density structure (including slabs) associated with subduction zones of the region. Estimates of the geoid are obtained from Geos- 3 and Seasat radar altimeter data. These data are very well suited to the task of detecting intermediate wavelength (600 - 4000 km) geopotential variations. Actually, subducting slabs can be expected to produce primarily intermediate and longer wavelength variations. Gravimetric profiles across trench/island arc complexes resolve primarily short wavelengths. The model represents subducting slabs as thin surfaces of anomalous mass per unit area. These surfaces are positioned using published seismicity results which detail the configuration of the <b>Benioff</b> <b>zones.</b> Crustal effects are ignored. Effects due to the contrast between the young thermal lithosphere of the behind-arc regions (marginal basins) and the older lithosphere seaward of the trench are modelled. Results indicate that the New Hebrides slab possesses an average areal density anomaly of about 300, 000 gm/sq cm. This is about three times that which is estimated for the Tonga-Kermadec slab.

40|$|The {{subduction}} of partially serpentinized oceanic mantle may {{potentially be}} the key geologic process leading to the regassing of Earth's mantle and also has important consequences for subduction zone processes such as element cycling, slab deformation, and intermediate-depth seismicity. However, {{little is known about}} the quantity of water that is retained in the slab during mantle serpentinization and the pattern of serpentinization that may occur during bending-related faulting; an initial state that is essential for quantifying subsequent dehydration processes. We present a 2 -D reactive-flow model simulating hydration processes in the presence of faulting at the trench outer-rise. We find that the temperature dependence of the serpentinization rate in conjunction with outer-rise faulting results in plate age and speed dependent patterns of hydration. Serpentinization also results in a reduction in surface heat flux toward the trench caused by advective downflow of seawater into the reaction region. Observed heat flow reductions are larger than the reduction due to the minimum-water downflow needed for partial serpentinization, predicting that active hydrothermal vents and chemosynthetic communities should also be associated with bend-fault serpentinization. Our model results agree with previous studies that the lower plane of double <b>Benioff</b> <b>zones</b> can be generated due to dehydration of serpentinized mantle at depth. More importantly, the depth-dependent pattern of serpentinization including reaction kinetics predicts a separation between the two Benioff planes consistent with seismic observations...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new hypothesis to explain the unusual pattern of intermediate-depth earthquakes in the Pamir-Hindu Kush region of central Asia. In our model the seismicity of the zone is defined by a remnant piece of oceanic crust that became neutrally buoyant and now hangs in the mantle underneath {{the center of the}} active mountain belt. We interpret an abrupt cutoff in seismicity shallower than 70 km under the Pamir as evidence that the slab has become decoupled from the surface deformation, and we suggest that the remnant slab has acted as a strain marker for flow in the upper mantle. The contortion of the slab can be explained by superimposed vertical and lateral simple shear related to {{the western edge of the}} Indian Plate. This model requires relatively low strain rates of the order of 10 - 15 s - 1, consistent with strain rates estimated from earthquake moment release in <b>Benioff</b> <b>zones.</b> In contrast, the double-facing subduction zone model applied by a number of previous authors requires strain rates of the order of 10 - 13 s - 1, which are much higher than inferred strain rates in subducting slabs.

The facts coming from surface geology, magmatism, geochemistry, different method tomographies, etc., are at variance with the alleged Africa-Eurasia convergence. The clues for rifting prevail over those for compression, and many tectonic situations previously interpreted as due to plate collisions, are associated to or mixed to rifting evidence. The proposal is put forward that uprising of mantle material wedges between two separating lithospheric plates could be a new working hypothesis. On an expanding Earth the region interposed between Eurasia and Africa has always had a smaller latitudinal extension with respect to the large Paleo Tethys and Neo Tethys appearing on constant- radius paleogeographical reconstructions. It is then possible, in the expanding Earth view, also to identify as phases of opening the Paleo Tethys and Neo Tethys currently alleged ‘closure’, which has added to the Proterozoic nuclei the Variscan and Alpine terranes respectively. These phases and their orogens have to be considered as extensional phases, and the added terranes of African provenance (e. g. the Adriatic fragment) should be regarded as fragments left behind as continental Africa moved away.
