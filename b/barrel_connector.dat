5000|$|According to Hosiden, {{this is a}} 12V/24V <b>barrel</b> <b>connector</b> {{designed}} for electronic equipment used in cars. The outside diameter is 6.5mm. http://www.aruncomponents.co.uk/Other%20DC.pdf ...|$|E
50|$|This is a unique-looking <b>barrel</b> <b>connector,</b> {{apparently}} {{intended for}} providing a DC output jack (most DC jacks {{are used for}} power input).|$|E
50|$|The SoundLink Mobile III was {{introduced}} in February 2014, still at US $300. Compared with its predecessor, the styling is different, swapping the fixed magnetic cover for an optional slip-on cover available in various colours. Battery life and speaker power are also increased, as has sound quality, according to Bose. Reviews have remained positive, but some now criticise the reliance on a traditional <b>barrel</b> <b>connector</b> for the charging adaptor instead of the Micro USB commonly used on modern mobile phones.|$|E
50|$|A coaxial power {{connector}} is an electrical {{power connector}} used for attaching extra-low voltage {{devices such as}} consumer electronics to external electricity. Also known as <b>barrel</b> <b>connectors,</b> concentric <b>barrel</b> <b>connectors</b> or tip connectors, these small cylindrical connectors come in an enormous variety of sizes.|$|R
50|$|The <b>connector</b> pairs for <b>barrel</b> <b>connectors</b> {{are defined}} in terms of 'plugs' and '{{receptacles}}'; receptacles are more commonly called 'sockets' (UK) or 'jacks' (US). Receptacles may be panel-mounted or circuit board-mounted. Plugs are on cables. Some 'in-line' receptacles are also cable-mounted.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Neutrik Speakon. The <b>connector</b> <b>barrels</b> are {{approximately}} 26 mm overall diameter.|$|R
50|$|<b>Barrel</b> plug <b>connectors</b> are {{commonly}} used to interface the secondary side of a power supply with the device. Some of these jacks contain a normally closed switch; the switch can disconnect internal batteries whenever the external power supply is connected.|$|R
5000|$|... 'lock-tab DC coaxial connector' (also called 'bayonet lock') {{offers a}} {{compromise}} that resists unplugging, but which will disengage when pulled hard enough. This connector uses small metal tab protrusions on the <b>connector</b> <b>barrel</b> to lock the plug in place, requiring a special push-and-rotate motion to engage the locks.|$|R
50|$|This list {{attempts}} to show all known sizes, and is annotated with some manufacturers producing selected types, since each manufacturer makes {{its own unique}} subset of the known types. Note that the example part numbers given may have different <b>connector</b> <b>barrel</b> (sleeve) lengths, and are not necessarily exact equivalents. There are many more design variants than can be listed in this table, so only a small sampling of part numbers is given.|$|R
5000|$|The term F-crimp was {{originally}} coined by AMP Incorporated (now TE Connectivity), however terminals of this style are currently manufactured by multiple companies. Crimpers {{are available from}} multiple sources: manufacturers of the connectors typically offer industrial crimp devices for high volume production, and specialized hand tools companies such as Ideal, Eclipse and Greenlee (formerly Paladin) offer dies for hand crimpers. For instance, Ideal die #30-586 and Paladin die #2033 are designed for open <b>barrel</b> / F-crimp <b>connectors.</b> Non-AMP crimpers are available in [...] "ratcheting" [...] ("Certi-Crimp") and non-ratcheting versions, but only ratcheting types are suitable for production applications, with non-ratcheting types being suitable for occasional, or [...] "field" [...] repairs. Non-ratcheted crimps must never be used in [...] "mission critical" [...] applications.|$|R
5000|$|Another problem arises {{after much}} {{use with the}} {{motherboard}} power connector; flap-like metal parts which contact {{the outside of the}} plug lose their tension and fail to make contact so that power does not reach the computer. The [...] "official" [...] solution is to replace the connector on the motherboard, which requires partial dis-assembly of the computer and desoldering a part with several pins; many companies charge a considerable sum for the work involved. Various simple alternatives have been suggested; for example a thin [...] "skin" [...] of solder {{on the outside of the}} <b>barrel</b> of the <b>connector</b> on the PSU (with care not to overheat the connector's plastic parts; and this thickened connector should not be used with other, not faulty Dell laptops, as it will stretch the springs and damage or even overheat the plug and socket assembly, causing them to melt or bond permanently).|$|R
