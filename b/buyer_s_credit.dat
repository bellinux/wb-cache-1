40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{coordination}} of order and production policy between buyers and suppliers in supply chains. When a buyer and a supplier of an item work independently, the buyer will place orders based on his economic order quantity (EOQ). However, the <b>buyer</b> <b>s</b> EOQ may not lead to an optimal policy for the supplier. It can be shown that a cooperative batching policy can reduce total cost significantly. Should the buyer have the more powerful position to enforce his EOQ on the supplier, then no incentive exists for him to deviate from his EOQ in order to choose a cooperative batching policy. To provide an incentive to order in quantities suitable to the supplier, the supplier could offer a side payment. One critical assumption made throughout in the literature dealing with incentive schemes to influence <b>buyer</b> <b>s</b> ordering policy is that the supplier has complete information regarding <b>buyer</b> <b>s</b> cost structure. However, this assumption is far from realistic. As a consequence, the buyer has no incentive to report truthfully on his cost structure. Moreover there is an incentive to overstate the total relevant cost in order to obtain as high a side payment as possible. This paper provides a bargaining model with asymmetric information about the <b>buyer</b> <b>s</b> cost structure assuming that the buyer has the bargaining power to enforce his EOQ on the supplier in case of a break-down in negotiations. An algorithm for the determination of an optimal set of contracts which are specifically designed for different cost structures of the buyer, assumed by the supplier, will be presented. This algorithm was implemented in a software application, that supports the supplier in determining the optimal set of contracts...|$|R

The model stylizes a buyer-seller relationship but the results apply quite naturally to many contractual situations including regulation and optimal income-taxation. I. rst show, through a simple example, that distortions need not vanish over time and need not be monotonic in the shock to the <b>buyer.</b> <b>s</b> valuation. These results are in contrast to those obtained in the literature that assumes a Markov process with a binary state space. e. g. Battaglini, 2005. I then show that when the sets of possible types in any two adja-cent periods satisfy a certain overlapping condition (which is always satis. ed with a continuum of types), then the dynamics of the optimal mechanism can be signi. cantly simpli. ed by as-suming the shocks are independent over time. Under certain regularity conditions, the optimal mechanism is then the same irrespective of whether the shocks are the <b>buyer.</b> <b>s</b> private informa-tion or are observed also by the seller. These conditions are satis. ed, for example, {{in the case of an}} AR(1) process, a Brownian motion, but also when shocks have a multiplicative e as it is often the case in. nancial applications. Furthermore, the distortions in the optimal quantities are independent of the distributions of the shocks and, when the <b>buyer.</b> <b>s</b> valuation is additively separable, they are also independent of whether the shocks are transitory or permanent. Finally, I show that assuming the shocks are independent not only greatly simpli. es the analysis but is actually without loss of generality with a continuum of types...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that the BOJ 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Credit</b> Rationing {{has been the most}} {{important}} measure to control the money supply in the Japanese monetary transmission mechanism. However, the recent innovation of money markets has also significantly influenced behaviors of banks and the non-bank public and, in turn, the money supply in a potent fashion. This paper presents a money market model in which money market innovations are taken into account with the BOJ 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>credit</b> rationing, which enables us to analyze the determination of the money supply. In the short run, the Bank of Japan has used the restriction of BOJ loans along with the restriction of the expansion of lending by banks to try to control the money supply. However, the development of money market brought less dependence of banks and the public on the Bank of Japan so that the Bank of Japan 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>credit</b> rationing is of limited usefulness as a monetary policy measure.

Extreme intimidation {{of banks}} by the Federal Reserve and U. S. federal government through jawboning and credible threats of increased regulatory oversight caused the crunches of 1966 and 1969. Thus, this article overturns {{the conventional wisdom}} that Regulation Q produced the 1960 <b>s</b> <b>credit</b> crunches. The 1980 crunch was the unintended effect of direct regulatory limits on credit extensions.

40|$|Schwarz surveys U. S. {{experience}} with directed credit as background {{for a larger}} study of the Asian experience. Almost half of net credit lent in the United States annually is directly affected by government policies - half of net credit covering budget deficits, and half falling under various federal credit programs. The main difference between U. <b>S.</b> and Asian <b>credit</b> policy is that U. <b>S.</b> <b>credit</b> policy is oriented more toward equity than toward growth. Different sectors are affected differently by U. <b>S.</b> <b>credit</b> policies. Few empirical studies test how U. <b>S.</b> <b>credit</b> policy affects growth - perhaps {{partly because of the}} motives behind those policies. Few enpirical studies even test whether the policies edffectively increase credit to the target group. Schwarz outlines a method for testing the effectiveness of credit policy, then examinesexisting empirical work to see how it fits that methodology. The first common empirical technique examines credit allocation in the economy. Schwarz finds that for the largest program, housing credit, the effect of credit program on credit allocation is very small and may be negative when cross-program effects are considered. The second common empirical technique examines individual sectors. Results here are mixed. In agriculture, much of the credit raises the demand for land, providing a gain for landowners rather than increasing production. In education, {{less than a third of}} the students who got government credit would not have gone to college without it. So in both cases, the credit has a positive impact but at a sizable cost. Schwarz concludes that despite its huge volume, directed credit in the United States has a limited impact in growth. The credit programs have generally succeeded in increasing credit to the targeted group, but not necessarily in increasing investment by that group.
