Line N had the smallest <b>weight</b> <b>percentages</b> of total lungs and liver (0. 54 and 2. 38 %) and biggest <b>weight</b> <b>percentages</b> of right and left shanks (2. 46 and 2. 48 %). Line F had the smallest spleen <b>weight</b> <b>percentage</b> (0. 20 %) and tallest right and left shanks (8. 50 and 8. 57 cm) and widest right and left shanks (3. 74 and 3. 75 cm). Gizzard <b>weight</b> <b>percentages</b> of lines N and CN (3. 37 and 3. 55 %) were significantly more than those of lines F and CF (2. 74 and 3. 00 %). The results indicated that neither short-term selection nor Na allele have influenced the development of heart. Na allele showed variable pleiotropic effects, where the <b>weight</b> <b>percentages</b> of lungs and liver were decreased and the <b>weight</b> <b>percentages</b> of gizzard and spleen were increased. A reduction in lung and liver <b>weight</b> <b>percentages</b> characterized the naked-neck selected line, revealing an interaction between selection and Na allele. The pressure of short-term selection for body weight was early noticeable {{on the development of}} liver and spleen that could initiate possible metabolic disorders or susceptibility to disease infection later with the continuity of selection scheme. Short-term selection albeit boosted the bilateral shank measurements, but did not influence the bilateral developmental stability. The developmental stability characterized the bilateral characters in chickens carrying Na allele, suggesting a role of Na allele in the developmental stability of the birds pertaining the natural heating waves.
