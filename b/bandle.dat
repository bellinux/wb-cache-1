Summary: “We study the dead-core problem for the fast diffusion equation with strong absorption. Unlike in many other related problems of singularity formation, we show that the temporal rate of formation of the dead-core is not self-similar. We moreover obtain precise estimates on rescaled solutions and on the single-point final dead-core profile. Results of this type were up to now known only for problems with linear diffusion. The proofs rely on self-similar variables and require a delicate use of the Zelenyak method. ” References 1.

30|$|However, Cirstea and Rădulescu [17] first {{introduced}} Karamata regular variation theory approaching {{to study the}} uniqueness and asymptotic behavior of boundary blow-up solutions, which enables us to obtain some qualitative behavior of the boundary blow-up solutions in a general framework. The asymptotic behavior of the boundary blow-up solutions near the boundary has been investigated by many researchers (see [17 – 39] and their references). It {{is well known that}} the first-order asymptotic expansion of the solution u(x) in terms of d(x) is independent of the geometry of the domain, whereas the second-order asymptotic expansion of the solution u(x) depends linearly on the mean curvature of the boundary of Ω. There have been many results about the first expansion of large solution for problem (1.1) with p= 2 and b(x), f(u) satisfying some proper conditions under different regularity boundary conditions (see [21 – 28]) and the second expansion (see[29 – 34] and references therein). <b>Bandle</b> and Marcus [29] first studied the influence of the geometry of Ω on the boundary behavior of the unique radially symmetric solution for problem (1.1) in a ball or an annulus when f(u) is of power form. Their results were extended by <b>Bandle,</b> Anedda, Porru et al. to more general boundary smooth domains, weights, and nonlinearities (see [30 – 34]). Specially, Cirstea et al. [17, 35 – 40] used the Karamata regular variation theory, nonlinear transformations, the perturbed method, the upper and lower solution method, and localization method to establish the first and second expansion of large solutions for problem (1.1) with p= 2, and Cirstea and Rădulescu [17] {{first introduced}} the set Λ. Recently, some results in [17, 35 – 40] have been extended to p> 2. For instance, Huang et al. [46 – 48] studied the existence and the first and second expansions of weak solutions when b(x) and f(u) satisfy some suitable conditions, which are different from the conditions in our paper.
