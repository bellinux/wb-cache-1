Shawnee, Aug. 17 -(Special) -Two teen-age Shawnee girls, non-swimmers, escaped possible death here Thursday night after their car plunged off a county bridge into the muddy water of the North Canadian river. The two girls, Colleen Marie Smith, 18, and Mrs. Dorothy Jean Thompson, 16, sisters, crawled through an open window and escaped with only minor scratches. They were assisted to the bank by several unidentified men who were fishing nearby. Car Plunges Off Bridge The car landed on the driver`s side in about five feet of water. Most {{of the last four}} or five months, the river has been bank-full and has had a swift current. But the last two weeks it had fallen four or five feet. If the river had been at the higher level, several feet of water would have covered the car. Mrs. Thompson said she was driving the car across the bridge, which is about a half mile east of Shawnee. She said the car slipped off the plank runners which are on the <b>bridge</b> <b>flooring.</b> When she tried to bring the car back up on the runners she lost control. The car plunged off one side of the bridge-there was no guard rail on this end-and "we thought we were gone," Mrs. Thompson said. Both Lucky, Unlucky At one time almost hundred spectators were gathered at the scene. The car was hauled out of the water about two hours after the accident. The girls considered themselves lucky to get out alive. But they also thought they were unlucky. The car, given to Mrs. Thompson only a month ago by her husband who is in Korea, was almost a total loss. And to top it all off. Mrs. Thompson was charged with driving without a license. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{high range}} water reducer in <b>bridge</b> <b>floors</b> was {{initiated}} by an Iowa Highway Research Board project (HR- 192) in 1977 for two basic reasons. One {{was to determine the}} feasibility of using a high range water reducer (HRWR) in <b>bridge</b> <b>floor</b> concrete using conventional concrete proportioning, transporting and finishing equipment. The second was to determine the performance and protective qualities against chloride intrusion of a dense concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>floor</b> by de-icing agents used on Iowa's highways during winter months. This project was basically intended to overcome some problems that developed in the original research project. The problems alluded to are the time limits from batching to finishing; use of a different type of finishing machine; need for supplemental vibration {{on the surface of the}} concrete during the screeding operation and difficulty of texturing. The use of a double oscillating screed finishing machine worked well and supplemental vibration on one of the screeds was not needed. The limit of 45 minutes from batching the concrete to placement on the deck was verified. This is a maximum when the HRWR is introduced at the batch plant. The problem of texturing was not solved completely but is similar to our problems on the dense "Iowa System" overlay used on bridge deck repair projects. This project reinforced some earlier doubts about using truck transit mixers for mixing and transporting concrete containing HRWR when introduced at the batch plant...|$|R
40|$|Project {{conducted}} {{in cooperation with}} the U. S. Department of Transportation This report documents the results of a study of on-system historic metal truss bridges in Texas. On-system bridges are those located on the state highway system, and the surviving on-system historic trusses in Texas were typically constructed in the 1920 s and 1930 s. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} investigate methods that can be used to develop an accurate and realistic load rating for an older on-system truss bridge. In order to examine issues involved in the structural evaluation of older on-system truss bridges, two case study bridges were investigated in detail. In addition, a full-scale laboratory experimental investigation was conducted on a single bay of a typical truss <b>bridge</b> <b>floor</b> system. Evaluation of the case study bridges indicated that the primary structural deficiency in these bridges was inadequate capacity of the steel floor beams and stringers, based on conventional load rating techniques. The analysis and field load testing conducted on the case study bridges and the laboratory investigation therefore focused primarily on the <b>bridge</b> <b>floor</b> systems. The results of this study indicate that the use of standard AASHTO load rating techniques can substantially underestimate the strength of the floor beams and stringers. A significantly more accurate prediction of the structural response of the floor members to truck live loads can be achieved by conducting an elastic finite element analysis of the <b>bridge</b> <b>floor</b> system.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} project are: (1) To determine the feasibility of proportioning, mixing, placing and finishing a dense portland cement concrete in a <b>bridge</b> <b>floor</b> using conventional mixing, placing and finishing equipment. (2) To determine the economics, longevity, maintenance performance and protective qualities of a dense portland cement concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>floor</b> when using a high rangewater reducing admixture.

A low water-cement ratio contributes greatly to increased strength. The normal 7 day strength of untreated concrete would be expected i n 3 days using a superplasticizer. A dense concrete also has the desirable properties of excellent durability and reduced permeability.
