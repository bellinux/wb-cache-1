5|$|BackupHDDVD {{represented}} {{the first known}} successful attack against AACS. The utility circumvents content protection by decrypting video files directly with AES, the underling cryptographic cipher used by AACS. Using this technique, BackupHDDVD is able to completely <b>bypass</b> <b>the</b> AACS chain of trust, rendering it immune to revocation. The cost of this immunity is that users are forced to rely on keys leaking from commercial player software to use BackupHDDVD with new discs.|$|E
5|$|Coronary artery {{bypass surgery}} {{is one such}} operation. In this operation, one or more arteries {{surrounding}} the heart that have become narrowed are bypassed. This is done by taking blood vessels harvested from {{another part of the}} body. Commonly harvested veins include the saphenous veins or the internal mammary artery. Because this operation involves the heart tissue, a machine is used so that blood can <b>bypass</b> <b>the</b> heart during the operation.|$|E

The engine controller regulates the amount of gaseous hydrogen allowed to <b>bypass</b> <b>the</b> nozzle coolant loop, thus controlling its temperature. The chamber coolant valve is 100% open before engine start. During engine operation, it is 100% open for throttle settings of 100 to 109% for maximum cooling. For throttle settings between 65 and 100%, its position ranged from 66.4 to 100% open for reduced cooling.|$|E
5|$|A month later, an {{environmental}} {{study was conducted}} {{that focused on the}} possibilities of rerouting the proposed freeway. In April 1972, the majority of voters supported a referendum that halted plans to build the SR78 freeway through the city of Escondido. The city then turned its focus to widening Lincoln Avenue and Ash Street instead, and also requested that the routing of SR78 be moved to Broadway, Washington Avenue, and Ash Street from Grand Avenue to improve traffic flow. Five years later, signs were installed on eastbound SR78, directing traffic headed for the San Diego Zoo Safari Park to use I-15 south to Via Rancho Parkway instead of continuing eastbound, to <b>bypass</b> <b>the</b> Escondido traffic.|$|E
