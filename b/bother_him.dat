5|$|The {{story line}} took on many forms during production. His {{original}} idea featured a 30-year-old man dealing with monsters that he {{drew in a}} book as a child coming back to <b>bother</b> <b>him</b> as an adult. Each monster represented a fear he had, and conquering those fears caused the monsters eventually to disappear.|$|E
5|$|Motley's knees {{continued}} to <b>bother</b> <b>him</b> in 1952. While he showed occasional signs {{of his old}} form that season, {{it became clear to}} the Browns' coaching staff that he was no longer in his prime. Motley finished the year with 444 yards of rushing and 4.3 yards per carry, a career low. The Browns finished with an 8–4 record but still captured the conference title and secured another spot in the NFL championship game. Motley performed well in that matchup against the Detroit Lions, rushing for 95 yards. The Browns, however, lost 17–7.|$|E
5|$|Pemberton was {{boxed in}} {{with lots of}} munitions and little food. The poor diet was showing on the Confederate soldiers. By the end of June, half were out sick or hospitalized. Scurvy, malaria, dysentery, diarrhea, and other {{diseases}} cut their ranks. At least one city resident had to stay up at night to keep starving soldiers out of his vegetable garden. The constant shelling did not <b>bother</b> <b>him</b> {{as much as the}} loss of his food. As the siege wore on, fewer and fewer horses, mules, and dogs were seen wandering about Vicksburg. Shoe leather became a last resort of sustenance for many adults.|$|E

5|$|The {{impending}} {{dinner with}} Mr. Burns divides the Simpson household. Homer pragmatically supports Mr. Burns, while Marge and Lisa oppose him. Before the dinner arrives, Mr. Burns's advisers prepare {{the family for}} the event, even giving them pre-written questions to ask in lieu of conversation. Lisa becomes disillusioned by it all, but Marge tells her not to worry. To everyone's surprise, Marge serves Blinky for dinner. Mr. Burns tries {{to act as if}} it does not <b>bother</b> <b>him,</b> but is not able to keep from spitting it out. The cameras flash as the bite flies through the air, {{and by the time the}} chunk hits the floor the press is gone and his governatorial campaign dissolves. Bailey wins the election and, despite Mr. Burns saying that Homer's dreams will be unfulfilled for as long as he is alive, the Simpson family happily get together again.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, without resigning from Parliament, Kent Hughes {{rejoined the}} Army, {{becoming}} a {{colonel in the}} 8th Division. He served in the Malaya campaign of 1942, where he was again mentioned in despatches. Kent Hughes was taken prisoner by the Japanese in Singapore and was kept in the Changi Prisoner Of War camp, where he was beaten and half-starved. In 1943 he was shipped as a slave labourer to Taiwan. In October 1944 he was shipped to Japan and on to Korea, and then sent by rail to Mukden in Manchuria, where prisoners of war were put to work in arms factories. In August 1945 Kent Hughes was liberated by the invading Red Army and returned to Australia with an amoebic complaint that would continue to <b>bother</b> <b>him.</b> While imprisoned, Kent Hughes secretly wrote what became Slaves of the Samurai, a colourful account of his wartime experiences, published in 1946. He also took up the case of Australian General Gordon Bennett, {{who was accused of}} cowardice and desertion after leaving Singapore without authorisation shortly before the city surrendered to the Japanese. Kent Hughes appeared before the Royal Commission into Bennett's case, and argued that Bennett was correct to avoid being taken prisoner and return to Australia to continue the fight.|$|E
5|$|On July 16, 2015, Barea re-signed {{with the}} Mavericks to a four-year, $16 million contract. On December 23, 2015, Barea scored a career-high 32 points on 13-of-20 {{shooting}} in a 119–118 overtime {{win over the}} Brooklyn Nets. Three days later, he made a career-high seven three-pointers and finished with 26 points in a 118–111 win over the Chicago Bulls. On March 30, 2016, he scored 26 points and made the go-ahead layup with 49.9 seconds left as the Mavericks rallied {{in the fourth quarter}} to beat the New York Knicks 91–89. On April 6, he helped the Mavericks win their fifth straight game, recording game highs of 27 points and 8 assists in an 88–86 victory over the Houston Rockets. Having become the Mavericks' sparkplug late in the season with Deron Williams sidelined, Barea suffered his own injury on April 8, a right groin strain which forced him to leave the game against the Memphis Grizzlies after just eight minutes. The groin injury continued to <b>bother</b> <b>him</b> {{for the rest of the}} regular season and into the Mavericks' first round playoff series with the Oklahoma City Thunder.|$|E

During the sinking a falling spar broke Paddon’s right shoulder-blade and two of his ribs, injuries that would <b>bother</b> <b>him</b> {{for the rest of his}} life. The Dutch rescued the surviving crew who surrendered to troops from Amsterdam.|$|E
25|$|Jones {{remained}} with the Browns in 1948 {{as the team}} went undefeated and won the title {{for the third time}} in a row. He scored two touchdowns in the championship game. In a 1949 game against the Los Angeles Dons, Jones suffered a broken collarbone and missed the remainder of the regular season. The Browns again reached the championship, and Jones returned to play in the game, which Cleveland won for the fourth straight time. His shoulder continued to <b>bother</b> <b>him,</b> however, and he decided to retire after the season.|$|E
25|$|Debye's son, Peter P. Debye, {{interviewed in}} 2006 at age 89 recollects {{that his father}} was {{completely}} apolitical and that {{in the privacy of their}} home politics were never discussed. According to his son, Debye just wanted to do his job at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and as long as the Nazis did not <b>bother</b> <b>him</b> was able to do so. He recalls that his mother urged him (the son) to stay in the US in the event of war. Debye's son had come to the US on a planned 2-month vacation during the summer of 1939 and never returned to Germany because war did, indeed, break out.|$|E

25|$|After graduating, Stevenson {{conducted}} research in biochemistry. His first residency {{was at the}} Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal (1944–1945), but his lung condition continued to <b>bother</b> <b>him,</b> {{and one of his}} professors at McGill advised him to move to Arizona for his health. He took up a residency at St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona (1945–1946). After that, he held a fellowship in internal medicine at the Alton Ochsner Medical Foundation in New Orleans, became a Denis Fellow in Biochemistry at Tulane University School of Medicine (1946–1947), and a Commonwealth Fund Fellow in Medicine at Cornell University Medical College and New York Hospital (1947–1949). He became a U.S. citizen in 1949.|$|E

500|$|Veteran UPI {{reporter}} Helen Thomas {{suggested that}} in public, the Nixons [...] "moved through life ritualistically", but privately, however, they were [...] "very close". In private, Richard Nixon {{was described as}} being [...] "unabashedly sentimental", often praising Pat for her work, remembering anniversaries and surprising her with frequent gifts. During state dinners, he ordered the protocol changed so that Pat could be served first. Pat, in turn, felt {{that her husband was}} vulnerable and sought to protect him. Of his critics, she said that [...] "Lincoln had worse critics. He was big enough not to let it <b>bother</b> <b>him.</b> That's the way my husband is." ...|$|E
500|$|Slayer's {{previous}} album Show No Mercy {{had sold}} over 40,000 copies worldwide {{and the band}} were performing the songs [...] "Chemical Warfare" [...] and [...] "Captor of Sin" [...] live, which made producer Brian Slagel want to release an EP. The album was recorded in Hollywood with sound engineer Bill Metoyer, in a studio with no carpet which was a problem while recording the drums. Slagel was acting as executive producer. Metoyer is Christian and the lyrics from Show No Mercy did not <b>bother</b> <b>him.</b> However, the first words Araya sang when recording Haunting the Chapel were [...] "The holy cross, symbol of lies, intimidates the lives of Christian born", and other anti-religious lyrics; Metoyer thought {{he would go to}} Hell for his part in recording the lyrics. These lyrical themes were inspired by the band Venom, who influenced King and was also into the Satanic image.|$|E
500|$|Vore {{said that}} the game is lacking in [...] "advanced {{graphics}} and interface", but felt that it makes up for it through its charm and intrigue. Thomas called the character designs outstanding, but thought that the reused art assets for returning characters and locations from the first game made it feel like Capcom had [...] "cut some corners". He called the music [...] "uniformly outstanding and used masterfully", both for conveying various moods throughout the story, and for characters' personalities. Harris found the music [...] "moody and appropriate", but wished {{that there had been}} a full voice-over as an option. He {{said that the}} game's art was nice, but not more than that. Thomas called the localization outstanding despite finding some errors, finding it impressive how smoothly Capcom was able to localize such a text-heavy game. Harris liked the game's localization, saying that the localization team's writing was what made the game design work so well. Walker called the localization incredible, and said that while there are a few spelling errors and grammatical errors in the text, it did not <b>bother</b> <b>him</b> much as the localization was included in the Japanese Nintendo DS release.|$|E

500|$|By {{the early}} 1990s Hordern was concentrating more on television. His roles were mostly those of ageing teachers, bank managers, {{politicians}} and clergymen. In 1989 he appeared alongside John Mills in {{an adaptation of}} Kingsley Amis's Ending Up, a tale {{about a group of}} pensioners growing old together in a residential home. [...] After that he took the part of Godfrey Colston in Memento Mori, a television film about a group of elderly friends succumbing to old age, which was adapted for television from the Muriel Spark novel of the same name. The film received excellent notices [...] and Hordern's performance was described as outstanding by the critic Neil Sinyard. All that was required of Hordern in his next role, the wealthy but terminally ill landowner Peter Featherstone in the BBC adaptation Middlemarch, was for him simply to lie in bed and pretend to die. It was the kind of role which he found to be most fitting for someone of his advanced years and confirmed to him that the older he got, the more typecast he became. It was a situation that did not altogether <b>bother</b> <b>him</b> as he felt grateful for being employable at the age of 81.|$|E

500|$|McCain was {{promoted}} to commander effective July 1973 and attended the National War College in Fort McNair in Washington, D.C. during the 1973–1974 academic year. There he intensively studied the history of Vietnam and the French and American wars there, and wrote [...] "The Code of Conduct and the Vietnam Prisoners of War", a long paper on the Vietnam POW experience {{as a test of}} the U.S. Code of Conduct. By the time he graduated, he concluded that mistakes by American political and military leaders had doomed the war effort. He accepted the right of the anti-war movement in the U.S. to have exercised their freedom to protest, and he adopted a live-and-let-live attitude towards those who had evaded the draft. Nor did the vast changes in American social mores that had taken place during his absence <b>bother</b> <b>him,</b> as it did many other former POWs. McCain returned to Saigon in November 1974; he {{and a couple of other}} former POWs received the National Order of Vietnam, that country's highest honor. He also spoke at the South Vietnamese war college, five months before Saigon fell. McCain resolved not to become a [...] "professional POW" [...] but to move forward and rebuild his life. Few thought McCain could fly again, but he was determined to try, and during this time he engaged in nine months of grueling, painful physical therapy, especially to get his knees to bend again.|$|E
