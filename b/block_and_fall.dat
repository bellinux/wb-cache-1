40|$|In NE Italy, {{fast-moving}} landslides {{represent a}} significant threat {{both to the}} population and the built environment. In the eastern portion of the Italian Alps, rock <b>falls</b> are common <b>and</b> are often responsible for casualties or severe damage to infrastructure. This type of landslide is characterized by strong relief energy and is triggered by earthquakes or copious rainfall, which often exceeds 2000 mm/yr. To assess rock fall hazard using software analysis, field surveys are crucial to accurately recognize the source areas of falling rock phenomena, to quantify the volumes of unstable <b>blocks</b> <b>and</b> identify the possible block trajectories. The current work takes in detailed geological and geomorphological mapping, through the identification of dislodged <b>blocks,</b> fractures <b>and</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>blocks</b> on a much-frequented limestone cliff in the Trieste Karst used as a climbing spot. Moreover, a popular tourist path (the Napoleonica) lies {{at the foot of}} the climbing cliffs. In-depth traditional activities, such as field surveys and aerial photo analysis were undertaken, including morphometric and geomechanical characterization of the whole rock mass, in order to perform a first identification of the more hazardous sections of the Napoleonica. The field data were collected using UAV (Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle) images and videos and this innovative technique allow the reaching and study of difficult sites with excellent resolution and precision. The final output is a GIS-developed map, that will be the starting point for future 2 D and 3 D simulations, that will lead to the creation of a rock fall susceptibility evaluation of the whole area...|$|R
40|$|Methane {{can be a}} {{significant}} hazard in coal mine longwalling operations and extensive methane mitigation techniques are employed by coal mine operators. Reservoir modeling techniques are used {{to better understand the}} liberation and migration of methane from the surrounding rocks towards the mine ventilation system. The caved rock behind the advancing longwall face, known as the gob, can contain high void ratios, providing high permeability flow paths to the methane. The gob is progressively compacted by the weight of the overburden, resulting in a reduction in the void ratio and associated permeability. Estimating the permeability distribution within the gob poses challenges due to its complexity. The authors have developed a new methodology to determine both horizontal and vertical variations in the permeability of the gob. Variations of the permeability in the vertical direction are based on a model of caving <b>and</b> <b>block</b> rotation, which considers the effect of <b>block</b> dimensions <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> height on the void ratio. Gob compaction by the overburden and associated permeability changes are determined from a three-dimensional geo-mechanical model which simulates the gob as a strain hardening granular material. The resulting three-dimensional permeability distribution in the gob is then transferred to a reservoir model. The paper demonstrates the application of the method and shows that reasonable results are obtained when compared to empirical experience and measurements...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA small-aperture (40 m) short-period seismic array was {{installed}} during four {{months on the}} Vercors massif (Western French Alps) {{at the top of}} a limestone column which collapsed one month and a half later. During this monitoring period, 193 seismic events were recorded by the seven seismometers of the array. Signal analysis yielded three main types of nearby seismic events to be identified from temporal and spectral characteristics: microearthquakes (single or multiple events), individual <b>block</b> <b>falls</b> <b>and</b> rock <b>falls.</b> It turned out that 60 per cent of the 193 events were classified as microearthquakes, exhibiting distinct P and S waves, while 17 per cent of these events remained unclassified. Out of the microearthquakes, 40 events with a good signal-to-noise ratio were selected and processed.  P- and S-wave traveltimes were picked on the records and the inferred hypocentral distances agree with the two zones of the scarp exhibiting fresh ruptures after the fall. Polarization analysis of the 3 -C records, along with numerical simulations, allowed discriminating between the two possible rupture mechanisms (toppling and sliding). Shear rupture (sliding) was the predominant mode in the lower part of the column whereas traction rupture (toppling) affected the upper part. Finally, the comparison between the ground motions recorded on the column and on the rock mass showed a systematic amplification on the column. Signal processing and numerical modelling both suggest that this amplification resulted from the excitation of the natural frequencies of the column and is particularly high (> 3) for microearthquakes occurring at the column-to-mass interface...|$|R

50|$|In several {{modes of}} play, {{rectangular}} garbage of various widths and heights can drop from above {{the playing field}} {{to add to the}} stack. When a block is cleared while touching a piece of garbage, the garbage piece and all same-colored garbage pieces contiguous with it are transformed as a group, space by space from right to left, row by row from bottom to top. In the transformation, the bottommost layer of each piece of garbage is turned into blocks. The rising of the stack is stopped during the transformation of garbage. Until the entire transformation event is completed for the entire group, the newly formed blocks still behave as part of the garbage, and cannot be moved or used in a clear. Once the transformation event is completed the newly formed <b>blocks</b> move, <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> clear as normal.|$|R

Multiple regression was used to determine which independent variables (mass of piece, <b>fall</b> distance <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> ratio, notch angle and depth) best predicted forces. Tops and pieces exhibited different relationships with mass, which was the best predictor of force at the <b>block</b> <b>and</b> tension in the rope.

40|$|Sideways falls {{onto the}} hip {{are a major}} cause of femoral {{fractures}} in the elderly. Martial arts (MA) fall techniques decrease hip impact forces in sideways falls. The femoral fracture risk, however, also depends on the femoral loading configuration (direction and point of application of the force). The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of fall techniques, landing surface <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> height on the impact force and the loading configuration in sideways falls. Twelve experienced judokas performed sideways MA <b>and</b> <b>Block</b> ('natural') <b>falls</b> on a force plate, both with and without a judo mat on top. Kinematic and force data were analysed to determine the hip impact force and the loading configuration. In falls from a kneeling position, the MA technique reduced the impact force by 27 %, but did not change the loading configuration. The use of the mat did not change the loading configuration. Falling from a standing changed the force direction. In all conditions, the point of application was distal and posterior to the greater trochanter, but it was less distal and more posterior in falls from standing than from kneeling position. The present decrease in hip impact force with an unchanged loading configuration indicates the potential protective effect of the MA technique on the femoral fracture risk. The change in loading configuration with an increased fall height warrant further studies to examine the effect of MA techniques on fall severity under more natural fall circumstances...|$|R
