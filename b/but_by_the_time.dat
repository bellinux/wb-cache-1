5|$|A {{total of}} 962 {{vehicles}} were produced from 1942 to 1943. It {{had originally been}} planned that Britain would receive all of the examples produced through Lend-Lease, intending to use them in the Western Desert, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> they arrived the campaign was over. Additionally, the purpose-built M10 tank destroyer, armed with a 3-inch gun (and later a 17-pounder gun in British service) had begun to enter production. As a result, the British transferred 650 half-tracks to the Soviet Union under the Soviet Aid Program. Britain retained 30 and the remainder were taken by the US; except for one kept by the U.S. Army, these British and American vehicles were converted back to standard M3 Half-tracks.|$|E

50|$|Although {{a number}} of writers have {{suggested}} that Charles Walton had lent Potter money and its repayment was overdue, there is no proof that this was the case.

5|$|The Inclosure Act {{separated}} Gateshead Fell into Wrekenton and Sheriff Hill (collectively High Fell) plus Low Fell.

Progress was slow, with the last allotment disputes not settled until 1822, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of completion, Gateshead Fell was entirely enclosed and effectively consigned to history.

Catherine de' Medici, wife of King Henry II of France, was one of Nostradamus's greatest admirers. After reading his almanacs for 1555, which hinted at unnamed threats to the royal family, she summoned him to Paris to explain them and to draw up horoscopes for her children.
