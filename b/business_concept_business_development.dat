The investigator presented {{on the third}} of April 2008 a report (SOU 2008 : 32) that suggests abolishment of the statutory audit for approximately 97 % of all private corporations in Sweden.

The contribution of our work is given in terms of SACIS. SACIS is solely a model for supporting the mutual understanding of stakeholders about the crucial and ever changing issues and interests that related with a coordinated and proactive enterprise development. Firstly, whereas the current use of Business Case is associated mostly with financial issues SACIS provide a sound platform for socio-cultural, functional, info-logical, structural issues etc. Secondly, whereas current use of Business Case is context free, SACIS provides a proactive social context where a coordinated enterprise development takes place. Finally, whereas the current use of Business Case is project oriented, SACIS relates use of Business Case in the context of <b>business</b> <b>concepts,</b> i. e. root definition of a business enterprise, and business models, i. e. information based business-wide architecture. The primary aim of our inquiry was to provide understanding of the following query: How can Business Case be used to evaluate the attractiveness of a strategy? To investigate this query the material has been collected through both literature study and an empirical study consisting of six interviews. Our systematic and empirical investigation provides the following answers: current techniques and models of Business Case are still in formative phase, strategy evaluation is based on the following logic: strategy agrees with vision (<b>business</b> <b>concept),</b> <b>Business</b> Case agrees with strategy (business model), Business Case agrees with vision, and finally strategy formulation and strategy evaluation is not enough...|$|R

40|$|Metaphor {{has been}} shown to play an {{important}} role in business science discourse. Yet, previous corpus-based studies only investigated a pre-selected list of metaphoric expressions, potentially rendering the analysis incomplete. Furthermore, some studies which only focused on lexis did not analyse how the lexical items may construct <b>business</b> <b>concepts</b> in terms of scenarios. The purpose of this research is to investigate metaphor used to construct <b>business</b> <b>concepts</b> in <b>business</b> research articles. 42 business research articles published in 2009 - 2010 from five journals ranked in the top-ten according to the 2007 journal impact factors (Thompson Reuters, 2008) constitute the data of this study. Semantic annotation software USAS (Rayson, 2008) was used to assist in the retrieval of metaphoric expressions. Furthermore, manual analysis of concordances was done to find metaphorical expressions that had not been captured by the semantic tags. The analysis of these metaphoric expressions was based on Conceptual Metaphor Theory (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980) and Metaphor Scenario (Musolff, 2006). Data analysis indicates that metaphor constructs <b>business</b> <b>concepts</b> as scenarios which have participants performing actions to reach their goal according to the SOURCE-PATH-GOAL schema of the source domains. At the centre of these scenarios, the BOUNDED SPACE source domain serves as a conceptual space or a setting for each scenario. Other source domains, which are WAR, SPORT, GAME, JOURNEY, MACHINE, LIVING ORGANISM, BUILDING and PHYSICAL FORCES, project the scenarios onto the space, forming interconnected and coherent scenarios of business discours...|$|R

We here try to conceptualize the term and <b>concept</b> <b>business</b> <b>development</b> by means of its constituents and its contextualized impact with regards to SME prospering. We prefer to see the study as descriptive as well as analytical. The <b>concept</b> of <b>business</b> <b>development</b> at a growth perspective is here approached by the barriers to growth small businesses faces and experiences. This is done by contextualizing the fundaments whereupon the growth process is based where we aim to systemize the determinants that constitutes small firms business developmental priorities. We prefer to problematize the subject and topic via the often occurring mistaken stereotyping that signifies small- contra larger firm activity, where the categorization regarding growth matters in many cases becomes skewed. Here minding that especially within the manufacturing industries (B 2 B), the companies are often large. As for the small manufacturing companies within B 2 B, we find their problems connected to growth and development not so strongly represented in the research. The purpose is accordingly to explore, and seek understanding for, barriers to growth in B 2 B SMEs at a business developmental perspective. With regards to methodology, the study is hermeneutic. We in this research ascribe ourselves to the qualitative standpoint and consider the thesis exploratory by means of, besides the theoretical approaches, the application of two case-studies followed by three "expert-interviews" (a total of five respondents). The interviews can be considered as semi-structured. When approaching the business developmental process for the B 2 B SME, we can state a general lacking supply-chain agenda where supply-chain management must be closely tied to organizational adjustment. The efficiency criteria must be fulfilled by adapting a product and a market mode. We here emphasize the relevance of a more proactive strategic standpoint on behalf of the often present reactive view. We further, in different ways stress the necessity of a thorough financial statement as the SME suffers from information asymmetry. Such financial and administrative implications must grow with the firm. Market needs must contextually be allowed to lead the development where synergy effects ought to be realized. We refer to this as a remained outside-in-perspective and state that flexibility regarding production governance must be sought for. At the efficiency criteria, it turns out that it is recommended for the SME, in particular B 2 B, to focus upon its core idea and activity and outsource the rest.

40|$|Organizations {{constantly}} need {{to adapt}} to the rapidly changing macro environment. Information systems, that hinder and restrain flexibility, may jeopardize the ability for organizations to survive. A new method for developing information systems called the Business Rules Approach has emerged with promises of business agility. The Business Rules Approach focuses on business rules which are reliant on a <b>Business</b> <b>Concepts</b> Model for their structure and vocabulary. This paper examines the relation between the business rules and the <b>Business</b> <b>Concepts</b> Model. We conclude that a <b>Business</b> <b>Concepts</b> Model with less participation facts between terms generally yield less complex rules and that a <b>Business</b> <b>Concepts</b> Model with more participation facts between terms generally yield more complex Business Rules. However the tradeoff for decreased complexity is a loss of the ability to talk about or verbalize certain terms. We conclude that generalization facts in the <b>Business</b> <b>Concepts</b> Model do not impact complexity of Business Rules. Finally, the ability to express Business Rules in natural language is not impacted by increases or decreases in <b>Business</b> <b>Concepts</b> Model complexity...|$|R

The independent grocery is at its core a social and partnership based endeavour, entailing strong choice editing for sustainability through the ‘consumer cum producer via retailer’ set-up. However, the supermarket may include more local and organic food in its product range on market conditions, in need of customer management, while the grocery can expand by decentralized multiplication of its <b>business</b> <b>concept.</b> The grocery also adds a new market channel for family farmers enabling better use of local resources, thereby renewing the market.
