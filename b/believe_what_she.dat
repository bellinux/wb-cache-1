5|$|In May 1944, it was {{announced}} that broadcast performers must organize themselves into a union, and that this union would be the only one permitted to operate in Argentina. Shortly after the union formed, Eva Duarte was elected its president. Fraser and Navarro speculate that Juan Per贸n made the suggestion that performers create a union, and the other performers likely felt it was good politics to elect his mistress. Shortly after her election as president of the union, Eva Duarte began a daily program called Toward a Better Future, which dramatized in soap opera form the accomplishments of Juan Per贸n. Often, Per贸n's own speeches were played during the program. When she spoke, Eva Duarte spoke in ordinary language as a regular woman who wanted listeners to <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> herself believed about Juan Per贸n.|$|E
25|$|The Carol Ferris {{version of}} Star Sapphire appears in , voiced again by Olivia d'Abo but without her accent this time. Her costume here {{is similar to}} the one {{currently}} worn by the Star Sapphires. She is hired to be part of Vandal Savage's Legion of Doom since she is the counterpart to Green Lantern. Her plan is to break Hal Jordan's will by making him believe he had let a hostage (almost identical to Carol) get killed by a terrorist that he could have easily defeated before harm befell her. As Hal mourns the dead girl, Carol walks up to him and berates him for his failure to save the woman and for hurting Carol, driving her into becoming Star Sapphire. Weeping, Hal takes off his ring, becoming a broken man as he continues to mourn the dead woman. When Batman arrives, he reveals that the woman was an android used by Star Sapphire to trick him, and that she had exposed him to the Scarecrow's fear gas in order to break his will, to which Hal dons his ring and becomes Green Lantern once more. When the Justice League storms the Hall of Doom, she faces off against him again. As they fight, Hal expresses anger over Carol's plan, saying that he couldn't <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> did, only for her to coldly remark that he broke her heart, and she would never stop trying to kill him for it. She manages to capture him but he escapes and knock her out. Hal proceeds to take away Carol's Star Sapphire gem, reverting her back to normal, and admits that he keeps hurting her. This version is shown to be able to create both energy blasts and hard constructs. She was the only one to use the non-lethal version of Batman's contingency plans and was the last member to be defeated.|$|E
500|$|Nicola {{sets out}} to seduce Ivan after an {{argument}} with her boyfriend Simon Meredith (Dale Meeks). Wheeler told Allison Maund from Inside Soap that Nicola calls Ivan for [...] "some comfort" [...] and they get drunk and [...] "very cosy"; but Ivan presumes they are just good friends. Ivan {{gets out of the}} shower wearing a towel and is confronted with Nicola [...] "dressed in her sexiest underwear". Ivan tells Nicola to stop because he loves Paul, but Simon's mother Lesley Meredith (Sherrie Hewson) walks in on them and assumes that they are having an affair. Nicola does not correct Lesley and tells her to <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> likes and then Paul learns of the situation. Wheeler said that Nicola realises she cannot [...] "get out of the lie now" [...] and even tells her father, Rodney Blackstock (Patrick Mower) that she has slept with Ivan. The actress added that [...] "Nicola's just quite pleased with the fact that she's got her own back on Ivan". He confronts her in public and asks her to tell the truth, but she [...] "turns on the waterworks" [...] to get everyone to turn against Ivan. Later Nicola argues with Paul and she tells him that she and Ivan have slept together many times. Wheeler said that Nicola just thinks [...] "Sod it, I'm going to leave them all stewing". Her lies ruin Ivan's relationship with Paul, who believes Nicola's lies.|$|E

500|$|Davis gained {{international}} attention after her refusal to issue marriage licenses {{and the ensuing}} controversy her actions caused. Many legal experts asserted that Davis had no standing under the law to refuse to issue the licenses. Columbia Law School professor Katherine Franke said, [...] "Kim Davis has all sorts of religious liberty rights secured under the First Amendment and under other laws, {{but they are not}} at stake in this case. All she's asked to do with couples that come before her is certify that they've met the state requirements for marriage, so her religious opposition to same-sex marriage is absolutely irrelevant." [...] Professor Stephen Vladeck of American University's Washington College of Law said that Davis [...] "waived any right to have an objection to issuing same-sex marriage licenses when she ran for the job". Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin and others compared Davis' refusal to follow orders of the U.S. Supreme Court to Alabama Governor George Wallace's futile [...] "Stand in the Schoolhouse Door" [...] protest of desegregation in 1963. The Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT civil rights group, said, [...] "Ms. Davis has the fundamental right to <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> likes... but as a public servant, she does {{not have the right to}} pick and choose which laws she will follow or which services she will provide." [...] Attorney and author Roberta A. Kaplan, who argued for the plaintiffs in United States v. Windsor, wrote that [...] "Kim Davis is the clearest example of someone who wants to use a religious liberty argument to discriminate, yet she swore an oath to uphold the Constitution. It is laughable that she can then decide which laws to enforce, which is why every decision in her case has gone against her." ...|$|E
2500|$|The ACLU filed a suit on Sierra's behalf on December 9, 2001 {{against the}} school {{district}} and Mann, but the suspension was immediately upheld in the Kanawha County circuit court. Sierra's pro bono lawyers claimed that Mann was responsible for disruption, {{and that he could}} have taken the opportunity to teach his students about tolerance and constitutional rights instead of making misleading and incendiary comments in the media. The defense countered by saying constitutional rights did not apply equally to adults and students, with the latter not having the same latitude with regards to freedom of speech. Judge James Stucky rejected Sierra's request for a preliminary injunction on November 2, citing her voluntary withdrawal from the county school system, but scheduled a jury trial for her lawsuit for June 24. Stucky ruled that while Sierra was free to <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wanted and to express those beliefs, those rights were [...] "not absolute" [...] in a school setting and that the disruption she had caused there overrode her right to free speech. Stucky further declared that he could not guarantee her safety at Sissonville High School. The West Virginia Supreme Court voted 3-2 on November 27 against considering Sierra's petition to prevent the lower court from [...] "continuing to deny her freedom of speech".|$|E

60|$|Ursula {{looked out}} of the window. In her soul she began to wrestle, and she was frightened. She was always frightened of words, because she knew that mere word-force could always make her <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> did not believe.|$|E
60|$|I {{watched her}} for a moment, {{doubtful}} whether I ought to <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said or to alarm the house. But there was no sleepiness now in her eyes, and nothing drowsy in her voice; and she {{sat up in bed}} quite easily, without anything to support her.|$|E

Look at her now, my Lady, how she turns upon her poor old mother with her looks.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can this be so?" [...] exclaimed the queen, looking {{steadily}} {{into the}} face of the beautiful Indian to ascertain if the whole were not an artful deception. But the open and innocent face betrayed no guilt, and Isabella felt compelled to <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had heard. In order, however, to make certain of the fact, she questioned and cross-questioned Ozema, for near half an hour longer, and always with the same result.|$|E

"There," [...] he went on, stung into unkindness by his biting but {{unacknowledged}} jealousy, {{for she was}} right--on reflection he did {{not quite}} <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said as to her not being engaged. [...] "How unfortunate I am--I have said something to make you angry again. Why did you not walk with Mr. Davies? I should then have remained guiltless of offence, {{and you would have}} had a more agreeable companion. You want to quarrel with me; what shall we quarrel about?

60|$|LORD WINDERMERE. [Holding her hand.] Margaret, I thought Mrs. Erlynne {{was a woman}} more sinned against than sinning, as {{the phrase}} goes.

I <b>believed</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> told me--I was mistaken in her. She is bad--as bad as a woman can be.|$|R
60|$|Now I {{tried to}} think matters out as well as this {{disturbance}} would allow, for nothing hinders thought so much as snores. But what {{was the use of}} thinking?

She swore that she had seen Anscombe and Heda dead and afterwards had seen their graves.|$|R
6000|$|Archie, who {{had been}} hanging over the bed, slipped away into the inner room as she appeared, and Rose found Charlie waiting for her with such a happy face, she could not <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had heard and found it easy to say almost cheerfully as she took his eager hand in both of hers: [...] "Dear Charlie, I'm so glad you sent for me. I longed to come, but waited till you were better. You surely are?" [...] she added, as a second glance showed to her the indescribable change which had come upon the face which at first seemed to have both light and color in it.|$|E
6000|$|Professor White {{believed}} that Shelley recorded this estrangement only [...] "in veiled terms" [...] in Julian and Maddalo or in poems {{that he did}} not show to Mary, and that Mary acknowledged it only after Shelley's death, in her poem [...] "The Choice" [...] and in her editorial notes on his poems of that year. But this unpublished story, written after the death of their other child William, certainly contains, though also in veiled terms, Mary's immediate recognition and remorse. Mary well knew, I <b>believe,</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was doing to Shelley. In an effort to purge her own emotions and to acknowledge her fault, she poured out on the pages of Mathilda the suffering and the loneliness, the bitterness and the self-recrimination of the past months.|$|E
6000|$|She {{sank back}} in blank {{rejection}} of his look, and so remained motionless {{as he led}} the way from the porch with a quick and anxious step. Since those people came he had not openly recognized her presence, and now he had left her without a word. She could not <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> could not but divine, and she was powerless to stir as the three moved down the road towards the carriage. Then she felt the tears spring to her eyes: she flung down her veil, and, swept on by a storm of grief and pride and pain, she hurried, ran towards the grounds about the falls. She thrust aside the boy who took money at the gate. [...] "I have no money," [...] she said fiercely; [...] "I'm going to look for my friends: they're in here." ...|$|E

5000|$|The hottest {{lines on}} the album come nearly as an afterthought on the all-too-brief 'Birthday Cake,' {{produced}} by The-Dream. 'I know you wanna bite this/ It's so enticin'/ Nothin' else like this/ I'mma make you my bitch,' she sings. But as if the network censors had let the song run before realizing their mistake, {{a little over a}} minute into it the music fades out, just as it's getting dirty, leaving us wondering whether Rihanna really <b>believes</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> selling on [...] "Talk That Talk." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{was told}} that her lover would renounce her, {{but she would not}} <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was told. Of course he would accept the payment of his debts. Of course he would take an income when offered to him. What else was he to do? How was he to live decently without an income? All these evils had {{happened}} to him because he had been expected to live as a gentleman without proper means. In fact, he was the person who had been most injured. Her father, in his complete, in his almost abject tenderness towards her, could not say rough words in answer to all these arguments. He could only repeat his assertion {{over and over again that}} the man was utterly unworthy of her, and must be discarded. It was all as nothing. The man must discard himself.|$|E
6000|$|Verena {{scarcely}} {{knew what}} to say; then, remembering that Doctor Prance {{had told her that}} they might lose their dear old companion any day, and confronting it with something Basil Ransom had just said--that the Rational Review was a quarterly and the editor had notified him that his article would appear only in the number after the next--she reflected that perhaps Miss Birdseye wouldn't be there, so many months later, to see how it was her supposed consort had spoken. She might, therefore, be left to <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> liked to believe, without fear of a day of reckoning. Verena committed herself to nothing more confirmatory than a kiss, however, which the old lady's displaced head-gear enabled her to imprint upon her forehead and which caused Miss Birdseye to exclaim, [...] "Why, Verena Tarrant, how cold your lips are!" [...] It was not surprising to Verena to hear that her lips were cold; a mortal chill had crept over her, for she knew that this time she should have a tremendous scene with Olive.|$|E
60|$|I hated you then, and yet I couldn't {{crush the}} love that was in my heart. I used to try and drive you away from my thoughts, but every word you had ever said came back to me.

I said to myself that you had sacrificed George coldly, callously, prudently, but in my heart I knew it wasn't true. [He looks at her, hardly able to <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is going to say, but does not speak.] Your whole life stood on one side and only this hateful story on the other. You couldn't have grown into a different man in one single instant. I came here to-day to tell you that I don't understand the reason of what you did. I don't want to understand.

He <b>believed</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was saying and was devastated when it turned out that she was lying. It was much harder for him to accept when the real Dixie turned up alive and well.|$|R
