25|$|India's innings was {{as easy as}} it had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> ago. From {{the first}} 12 overs, Sehwag and Gambhir added 75 runs, before Sehwag edged Streak behind for a run-a-ball 44. Gambhir continued, though, and India lost no further wickets until the close of play, leaving them on 195 for 1 with Gambhir five runs short of his second Test century. Rahul Dravid was more subdued, only making 49 from 103 balls, and he was {{occasionally}} troubled by Streak – but not enough to surrender his wicket.|$|E
25|$|Modern historians {{tend to take}} {{a kinder}} view of Churchill’s actions at Antwerp. He had asked for the brigades minus recruits, {{and it had been}} Kitchener who insisted on {{retaining}} territorials in the UK to defend the East Coast against possible German invasion. Only 57 men were actually killed. In “The World Crisis” Churchill claimed he had prolonged Belgian surrender by a few days and occupied five German divisions. In fact it had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> and enabled Calais and Dunkirk to be secured. Rhodes James believes that Antwerp was “substantially to Churchill’s credit”. However, at the time he had thought that holding Antwerp would help the Allied advance north; the claim that it helped hold Calais and Dunkirk when the German advance resumed is hindsight. The more damaging attack, made inside and outside the Cabinet, was that Churchill was seeking publicity instead of running his department.|$|E

The winds drove the ship back; on 3 April, she was further north than she had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> earlier. Again and again, Bligh forced the ship forward, to be repeatedly repelled. On 17 April, he informed his exhausted crew that the sea had beaten them, {{and that they would}} turn and head for the Cape of Good Hope—"to the great joy of every person on Board", Bligh recorded.|$|E
