50|$|In 1973, <b>Billian</b> {{directed}} hardcore short-length loops for the Swedish company Venus Film. When {{the ban on}} hardcore pornography {{was lifted}} in Germany, he started to direct numerous short-length hardcore films there. In 1975, he directed the first German full-length hardcore feature film, Bienenstich im Liebesnest (soft version known as Im Gasthaus zum scharfen Hirschen, also known as Zimmermädchen machen es gern). In 1976, he directed Josefine Mutzenbacher...wie sie wirklich war? 1. Teil (Sensational Janine) about the early life of Viennese courtesan Josephine Mutzenbacher. The film that had the title role played by Patricia Rhomberg who also had an intimate relationship with <b>Billian</b> was his greatest success. During this period, <b>Billian</b> continued to shoot loops, a number of which attracted particular attention such as Massagesalon Elvira that featured Anne Magle, the Danish porn sensation of the '70s.|$|E
5000|$|Josefine Mutzenbacher...wie sie wirklich war? 1. Teil was {{conceived}} by <b>Billian</b> {{as the first}} part of a Josefine Mutzenbacher series but when the producer Gunter Otto of Herzog refused to finance a second part, <b>Billian</b> took the money from the production company Starlight and directed Die Beichte der Josefine Mutzenbacher (Josephine) in 1979. However, Otto who held the rights for the title released Josefine Mutzenbacher...wie sie wirklich war? 2. Teil (Professional Janine) in 1980. Both films were unable to reach the success of the 1976 film, particularly due to absence of Rhomberg and lack of continuity with the first film. In 1981 (Aus dem Tagebuch der Josefine Mutzenbacher [...] ), 1987 (Die Liebesschule der Josefine Mutzenbacher [...] ) & 1991 <b>Billian</b> directed three further Josefine Mutzenbacher titles. Gunter Otto made consecutive Josefine movies (Josefine Mutzenbacher - Wie sie wirklich war: 3,4,5,6. Teil) from 1982 to 1984.|$|E

Around this period as well, she starred in numerous hardcore loops directed by <b>Billian,</b> such as Venus in Seide and Schwarzer Orgasmus, which were among the first examples of interracial pornography on the German porn scene.

50|$|Sensational Janine {{features}} director Billian's girlfriend Patricia Rhomberg in {{the title}} role. <b>Billian</b> gave her the role in part because she had the proper dialect for it. It became the first pornographic film to feature a humorous Viennese German, which contributed significantly to its popularity among the German-speaking audience.|$|E
5000|$|Director Hans <b>Billian</b> was {{the protagonist}} of the period and the films were usually {{in line with the}} {{so-called}} [...] "Bavarian porn sex comedies", often depicting male performers as comic characters, like Sepp Gneißl in Kasimir der Kuckuckskleber (1977). This era was also characterised by several Josephine Mutzenbacher films.|$|E
