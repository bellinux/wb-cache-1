The impetus for this work is to help resolve large discrepancies existing between literature measurements of the formation enthalpy Delta (sub f) H deg (298) for exo-THDCPD. We find that use of the isodesmic <b>bond</b> <b>separation</b> reaction C 10 H 16 + 14 CH 4 yields 12 C 2 H 6 yields results for the exo isomer (JP 10) in between the two experimentally accepted values, for the composite methods G 3 (MP 2), G 3 (MP 2) //B 3 LYP, and CBS-QB 3.

40|$|Branched alkanes like {{isobutane}} and neopentane {{are more}} stable than their straight chain isomers, n-butane and n-pentane (by 2 and 5 kcal mol(- 1), respectively). Electron correlation is largely responsible. Branched alkanes have {{a greater number of}} net attractive 1, 3 -alkyl-alkyl group interactions, there are three such stabilizing 1, 3 "protobranching" dispositions in isobutane, but only two in n-butane. Neopentane has six protobranches but n-pentane only three. Propane has one protobranch and is stabilized appreciably, by 2. 8 kcal mol(- 1), relative to methane and ethane. This value per protobranch also applies to the n-alkanes and cyclohexane. Consequently, energy evaluations employing alkane reference standards, for example, of small ring strain and stabilizations due to conjugation, hyperconjugation, and aromaticity, should be corrected for protobranching, for example, by employing Pople’s isodesmic <b>bond</b> <b>separation</b> reaction method. This reduces the ring strain of cyclopropane to 19. 2 from the conventional 27. 7 kcal mol(- 1), while the stabilization energies of alkenes and alkynes due to hyperconjugation (5. 5 and 7. 7 kcal mol(- 1) for propene and propyne) and conjugation (14. 8 and 27. 1 kcal mol(- 1) for butadiene and butadiyne) are considerably larger than the traditional estimates. Widely diverging literature evaluations of benzene resonance energy all give approximate to 65 kcal mol(- 1) after adjusting for conjugation, hyperconjugation, and protobranching "contaminations. " The BLW (block localized wavefunction) method, which localizes pi bonds and precludes their interactions, largely confirms these stabilization estimates for hyperconjugation, conjugation, and aromaticity.

The combined approach, referred to as BLYP-D 3 -DCP, offers generally improved performance over both unadorned BLYP and BLYP with D 3 corrections with respect to the prediction of noncovalent binding energies (BEs) and covalent bond dissociation enthalpies (BDEs).

We show that the choice of reference enthalpies {{plays a crucial role}} in the assessment. Due to the large stoichiometric factors involved, errors of various origin are strongly amplified. Inconsistent reference data are avoided by computing reference energies at the CCSD(T) /CBS level. These are compared to results for a variety of standard DFs. Two different versions of London dispersion corrections (DFT-D 2 and DFT-D 3) are applied and found to be very significant. The most accurate results are obtained with B 2 GPPLYP-D 2 (MAD= 0. 4 kcal*mol - 1), B 2 PLYP-D 2 (MAD= 0. 5 kcal*mol - 1) and B 97 -D 2 (MAD= 0. 9 kcal*mol - 1) methods. Dispersion corrections not only improve the computed BSR energies but also diminish the accuracy differences between the DFs. The previous DFT-D 2 version performs better due to error compensation of medium-range correlation effects between the semi-classical and the density-based description. We strongly recommend not to overinterpret results regarding DF accuracy when based on a single set of chemical reactions and to use high-level theoretical data for benchmarking purposes...|$|E
40|$|Mixed quantum {{mechanics}}/quantum mechanics (QM/QM) and quantum mechan- ics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods make computations {{feasible for}} extended chemical systems by separating them into subsystems that are treated at different level of sophistication. In many applications the subsystems are covalently bound {{and the use}} of frozen localized orbitals at the boundary is a possible way to separate the sub- systems and to ensure a sensible description of the electronic structure near to the boundary. A complication in these methods is that orthogonality between optimized and frozen orbitals has to be warranted and this is usually achieved by an explicit or- thogonalization of the basis set to the frozen orbitals. An alternative to this approach is proposed by calculating the wave-function from the Huzinaga-equation that guaranties orthogonality to the frozen orbitals without basis set orthogonalization. The theoreti- cal background and the practical aspects of the application of the Huzinaga equation in mixed methods is discussed. Forces have been derived to perform geometry opti- mization with wave-functions from the Huzinaga-equation.

Three failure modes, ball cut, a combination of solder shear and solder/pad <b>bond</b> <b>separation,</b> and pad lift, are assessed for the different solders and reflow cycles. It is found that the shearing forces of the SP and SAC solder joints tend to increase slightly {{with an increase in}} the number of reflow cycles due to diffusion-induced solid solution strengthening of the bulk solder and augmentation of the shearing area. However, the shearing forces of the SACI solder joints decrease slightly after four cycles of reflow, which is ascribed to the thermal degradation of both the solder/intermetallic compound (IMC) and IMC/Ni interfaces. The SACI solder joints yield the highest strengths, whereas the SP solder joints give the smallest values, irrespective of the number of reflow cycles. Thickening of the interfacial IMC layer and coarsening of the dispersing IMC particles within the bulk solders were also observed. Nevertheless, the variation of shearing forces and IMC thickness with different numbers of reflow cycles was not so significant since the Ni under layer acted as an effective diffusion barrier.

The brackets were cemented to the enamel using a conventional two-paste orthodontic bonding resin, a light-cured, fluoride-releasing adhesive, a no-mix-orthodontic bonding resin and a light-curing glass ionomer cement. For {{evaluation of the}} experimental data the Weibull analysis was applied. The highest values for the Weibull modulus (m) and the 10 per cent probability of failure (0 '. 10) {{were found in the}} tested plastic brackets (Dentaurum Edgewise plastic bracket and Spirit bracket) using a no-mix orthodontic bonding resin (System 1). However, the tensile stresses for the 90 per cent probability of failure (0 '. 90) were over 10 MPaand carried the danger of enamel fracture. Bracket bonding with glass ionomer cement cannot be recommended because of the low bond strength values for the 10 per cent probability of failure (0 '. 10). The most favourable bracket-bonding system concerning the Weibull modulus (m), the 10 and 90 per cent probabilities of failure (0 '. 10 and 0 '. 90) and aesthetics was the ceramic bracket with the silane-treated base (Allure III) using the light-cured, fluoride-releasing orthodontic bonding resin (Sequence). Bond fracture occurred predominantly between bracket and orthodontic bonding resin, with two exceptions.

Nature (Lond.). 374 : 539 - 542). Under shear, neutrophil arrests due to bond formation events were as brief as 4 ms. Pause time distributions for neutrophils tethering on P-, E-, L-selectin, or peripheral node addressin (PNAd) were compared at estimated single bond forces ranging from 37 to 250 pN. Distributions of selectin mediated pause times were fit to a first order exponential, resulting in a molecular dissociation constant (k(off)) for the respective selectin as a function of force. At estimated single bond forces of 125 pN and below, all three selectin dissociation constants fit the Bell and Hookean spring models of force-driven bond breakage equivalently. Unstressed k(off) values based on the Bell model were 2. 4, 2. 6, 2. 8, 3. 8 s(- 1) for P-selectin, E-selectin, L-selectin, and PNAd, respectively. <b>Bond</b> <b>separation</b> distances (reactive compliance) were 0. 39, 0. 18, 1. 11, 0. 59 A for P-selectin, E-selectin, L-selectin, and PNAd, respectively.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis reports the theoreticalinvestigations on the geometrical and electronic structures of small siliconclusters doped with some representative main group elements, including Li, Mg,B, Al and also C by using quantum chemical calculations. Deep understanding oftheir geometric and electronic structures, energetics and bonding phenomenaconstitutes a necessary {{step in the}} extensive and intensive search forpromising clusters {{that could be considered}} as building blocks for furtherassemblies. Our searches for minima on thepotential energy surfaces were performed using two different approaches. In thefirst, we used a stochastic genetic algorithm to generate as many guessstructures as possible. Equilibrium structures that were initially detectedusing low-level computations, were then reoptimized using higher level methods. In the second approach, we made use of a chemical intuition, in that initialstructures of clusters SinXm were manually constructedby either substituting Si-atoms of the corresponding silicon frameworksby other element atoms, or adding dopant-atoms at various positions on surfacesof the Sin clusters. Theuse of the genetic algorithm is less effective for producing singlydoped-clusters having small sizes because most of relevant structures in Si clustersare relatively well known. On the contrary, the multi-doped and larger sizeclusters imply a huge number of initial guess structures and thus make thegenetic search necessary and more effective, even though such a search is oftentedious and computationally demanding. Nevertheless, only a combination ofdifferent search approaches allows a consistent set of lower-energy structuresto be obtained. We are confident that the isomers reported in this thesis atleast correspond to the lower-energy equilibrium structures. However, not onlya careful search is required, but the accuracy of the computational methodsused is equally crucial in the determination of global minima. The low-lying isomers of the clusterswere identified on the basis of theoretical results obtained by hybrid (U) B 3 LYPfunctional in conjunction with the 6 - 311 +G(d) basis set (d polarization plus spdiffuse functions), and then the ground states are assigned by high accuracy computationalmethods such as the composite G 3 B 3 and G 4 methods and when possible also the coupled-clustertheory extrapolated to the complete basis set CCSD(T) /CBS protocol. Concerningthe energetics, different basic thermochemical parameters of the clustersconsidered including total atomization energies (TAE), standard enthalpies offormation (&# 916;Hf),ionization energies (IE), electron affinities (EA), binding energies (Eb), embedded energy (EE) anddissociation energies (De) were determined using the Gn (G 3 B 3 and G 4) and CCSD(T) /CBS approaches. For bare silicon clusters, a uniform set of standard heats offormation for the cationic and anionic Sinclusters were determinedfor up to n = 13. Insome cases, variations between G 4 and CBS TAE values are relatively large. The differences of energeticproperties between both G 4 and CBS methods can be understood from the ways ofcomputing single point electronic energies, as well as the geometries ofclusters used. Geometry is beyond any doubt an important factor in thethermochemical evaluation. For these systems, experimentalresults in the current literature were also characterized by large uncertainties,including the actual uncertainty of the standard heat of formation of the Siatom. For otherparameters such as IE s and EAs,they were better predicted, in part due to a certain mutual cancellation oferrors in the evaluation of relative energies. The corresponding G 4 results areexpected to be accurate to, or even better than, ± 0. 15 eV. For lithiumdoped silicon clusters, the adiabatic (AIEs) and vertical (VIEs) ionizationenergies of the SinLim clusters were evaluated. CalculatedAIE and VIE values at the B 3 LYP/ 6 / 311 +G(d) and CCSD(T) /aug-cc-pVDZ levels forSi 6 Li 2, Si 7 Li, Si 10 Li, Si 11 Licompare quite well with the corresponding experimental results obtained usingthe photo-ionization efficiency measurements. For borondoped silicon clusters, heats of formation calculated by both G 4 andCCSD(T) /CBS methods showed good agreement with available experimental data. Overall, it appears that an accurateevaluation of the TAEs and thereby the standard heats of formation of silicon-basedclusters remains a great challenge for quantum chemical computations in order to attain thechemical accuracy of ± 1. 0 kcal/mol. Due to the non-classical bonding of clusters,the use of other thermochemical approaches (such as <b>bond</b> <b>separation</b> reactions) and more economic computational methods could not be applied. The only optionleft is to increase the quality of the wavefunctions in going beyond theCCSD(T) level. However, our preliminary computations using the full CCSDT treatmentpointed out that it is much more computer-demanding than the CCSD(T) method,which goes beyond our actual computing resources. Based on the geometricalcharacteristics of the ground states, a growth mechanism for each series ofbinary silicon clusters SinXm can now beestablished. Generally, alkali (Li) orearth-alkali (Mg) dopants prefers add on an edge or a face of Sin frameworks, whereas theboron group 13 element (B, Al) favors substitution into one of the Si positionsin Sin+ 1 counterparts. Due to the shorter B-Si bond lengths, as compared with the Al-Si counterparts,the B impurity can intrude inside the corresponding Si n cage (for up to n&# 8805; 8). In particular, the neutral structures of doubly impurities doped siliconclusters SinX 2,(X = Li, Mg, Al) have similar way of growing up: one dopant atom substitutesinto a position of Sin+ 1,whereas the other is usually added on an edge, or a face, of the existingcluster. Our theoretical results also predicted that some closed-shellsystems such as Si 9 B-, Si 10 B+, Si 9 Al-,and Si 4 C 2 + are characterized by enhanced stabilities. Theirhigher thermodynamic stabilities can be understood by the Jellium shell model(JSM). According to JSM, the valence electrons are supposed to befreely itinerant in a simple mean-field potential formed by the nuclei of atomsand core electrons, the valence electrons fill the hydrogen-like orbitals &# 8204;&# 8204;followingthe pattern of orbitals as [1 S 21 P 61 D 102 S 21 F 142 P 61 G 182 D 10 ]etc Within this model, the numbers of valence electrons of 8, 20, 34, 40, 56 and 68  emerge as the magic numbersthat actually correspond to a complete filling of the successive shellelectrons. Concerning the bonding phenomena, electron localization techniques (ELF and ELI-D) were used to locate the whereabouts of electrons, and thereby toidentify the chemical bonds of some specific clusters such as Si­ 3,Si 4, Si 42 +, Si 4 C 2 +, andSi 9 C. Calculations of the ring current, which is the magneticresponse of a molecule, were also carried out in order to probe their aromaticity. This study provided a further supportfor the point of view that the existence of delocalized occupied molecularorbitals in a planar molecule is a necessary but not sufficient condition toassign a certain aromatic character (aromatic, non-aromatic or anti-aromatic) to that specific type of electrons. Different criteria (such as the magneticring current) need to be considered for a more consistent evaluation of thispopular but intriguing molecular property. In addition, both the Si 4 C 2 +dication and the SiC 9 neutral exhibit a planar tetracoordinatecarbon atom (ptC) in their lowest-lying isomer. This is caused by a drivingforce for C-planarization which includes not only the electron delocalizationon the square frame but also the bonding between C-dopant and the Si frame of thesmall dication. In the larger neutral cluster cage, the Si 5 grouptends to stabilize electronically the cage by electron transfer but alsomechanically by geometrical constraints in maintaining a ptC configuration. We also attempted to search for potential linkers in makingsilicon nanowires. We found that the Mg dopant, due to its large electrontransfer capacity, behaves as a cation Mgdelta+ and thereby induces anionic entity with the Sindelta-anionic partner. The resulting Mg cation can be served as a linker between Sin blocks leading tostabilized linear [(Sik) Mg]lstructures in part due to electrostatic attraction forces. This allowed us to identify some suitable membersthat can further be used as superatoms for assemblies. We thus probed thefive-, seven-, eight- and ten-atom Si building blocks, {{and the role of the}} Mgelement as the linkers connecting them. Calculated results ofthe average assembling energy which gave us an idea about the tendency ofassembling the cluster of (SikMg) l with k = 5, 7, 8, 10, show that silicon clusters Si k tend to assemble in ring forms (Rl) over the linear forms(Ll) as the assembling energy of the Rl are larger than those of the Ll. However, a more important fact is that the average assembling energy of thelinear form tends to increase with the increasing size (l), implying that a(longer) nanowire can be considered as a plausible possibility.
