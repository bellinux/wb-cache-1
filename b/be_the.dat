5|$|According to David Potter, Vaballathus {{inherited}} his father's exact titles. Hartmann {{points that}} there have been cases where a Greek word was translated directly to Palmyrene and a Palmyrene equivalent was also used to mean the same thing. The dedication to Odaenathus would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> using of a Palmyrene equivalent, while the inscription of Vaballathus would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> direct translation. Despite all the arguments, it cannot be certain without doubt that Odaenathus was a corrector.|$|E
5|$|Although Gregory had {{intended}} London to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> southern archbishopric for the island, Augustine never moved his episcopal see to London, and instead consecrated Mellitus as a plain bishop there.

It may have been that the Kentish king did not wish greater episcopal authority to be exercised outside his own kingdom.|$|E
