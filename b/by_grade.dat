5|$|ATV Music Publishing {{remained}} a successful {{organization in the}} music industry throughout the 1970s. Len Beadle, the company's chief executive, signed up many songwriters and bought numerous song catalogues. The catalog acquisitions, along with the continuing royalties from Lennon and McCartney, ensured that large amounts of money were frequently coming in for ATV Music Publishing. Despite the success of the music publishing organization, other ventures formed <b>by</b> <b>Grade</b> were not performing as well. Pye Records, which continued to distribute music from artists such as Carl Douglas and Barry White, was failing to bring in large amounts of money. The main television arm of ATV lost its government-granted license in its then-current form and was restructured into Central Independent Television.|$|E
5|$|The School for Creative and Performing Arts {{opened in}} August 1973, {{as the only}} grade four through six school for the {{performing}} arts in the country and the first public school that combined all of the arts in a single program. The curriculum included art, instrumental music, choral music, dance and drama, and was not organized strictly <b>by</b> <b>grade,</b> but permitted students to advance as soon as their abilities allowed. Murray explained: Fourth through sixth grades will be together in classes. Teaching will often be done in teams. Art students will design scenery for plays, written by drama students. Music pupils will supply the music. They work together regardless of age. In reading classes they will read according to their own individual levels. A brilliant music student, capable of interpreting Beethoven's wildest dreams, might stumble on fifth level reading. This does not make him a dunce simply a slow reader.|$|E

The season's quality was also publicly derided by many fans of the programme, although over the following two seasons the criticism was balanced out by some happier viewers, who felt that the young team of writers being assembled by Cartmel was taking the programme in the right direction.|$|E

25|$|Individual {{members are}} {{allocated}} to branches. Historically branches were organised geographically and <b>by</b> <b>grade,</b> e.g. Liverpool; Dublin No. 1; Crewe No. 4 Technical; Crewe Management Staffs (the separate branches for different grades of staff were {{so that people}} with grievances against their managers wouldn't find those same managers as members of their branch). In Ireland, branches are still organised on this basis, but in the UK starting in 1998 there was a reorganisation such that members of most branches are employed by a single company e.g. Virgin Midlands - this was required in the fragmented world of the privatised railway because the private companies would not allow access for non-employees onto their premises.|$|E
30|$|Historically in the Eastern USA, high soil density has {{hindered}} {{forest tree}} establishment and growth. Soil compaction during reclamation {{can be avoided}} <b>by</b> minimizing <b>grading,</b> <b>by</b> restricting <b>grading</b> during dry soil conditions, and by using small equipment (Sweigard et al. 2007). The rough soil surface left <b>by</b> loose <b>grading</b> encourages water infiltration and provides little resistance to root growth, aiding forest reestablishment. Loose soils also aid establishment of “volunteer” plant species that may enter the site as seeds carried by wind or wildlife.|$|R

The district participates in the Interdistrict Public School Choice Program, which allows non-resident students to attend the district's schools without cost to their parents, with tuition paid by the state. Available slots are announced annually <b>by</b> <b>grade.</b> North Haledon residents had successfully voted in 2003 to leave the district, choosing to send their high school aged students to Midland Park High School in nearby Bergen County, New Jersey. In August 2004, the New Jersey Supreme Court decided against North Haledon, citing that the town's exit from the district would shift the ethnic and racial balance of the high school.

25|$|Maternal {{sensitivity}} even in {{the first}} few months of mother–child relationships are an important factor to health in childhood, especially with obesity. A study using data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development assessed mother–child interactions and categorized them in one of two groups: sensitive or insensitive. Their child's growth (height and weight) was monitored throughout their childhood, from 24 months all the way to grade six, and body mass index was calculated. As the children grew, the percentage of overweight or obese grew too. From 24 months the overall overweight-obese percentage was 15.58% and <b>by</b> <b>grade</b> six, 34.34% of the children were classified as overweight or obese. More interesting is the difference between the maternal sensitive group and the maternal insensitive group. The children with the sensitive mothers started out with an overweight-obese percentage of 14.96% (24 months) and ended the research with 29.54% (grade six). The children classified with insensitive mothers had an overweight-obese percentage of 16.16% at 24 months and 39.28% at grade six. This shows a significant correlation between the mother's sensitivity and the child's risk for overweight-obesity during their elementary years. This is very important for obesity prevention programs for children.|$|E
