40|$|Transit fare {{arbitrage}} is {{the scenario}} when {{two or more}} commuters agree to swap tickets during travel {{in such a way}} that total cost is lower than otherwise. Such arbitrage allows pricing inefficiencies to be explored and exploited, leading to improved pricing models. In this paper we discuss the <b>basics</b> of <b>fare</b> arbitrage through an intuitive pricing framework involving population density. We then analyze the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system to understand underlying inefficiencies. We also provide source code and comprehensive list of pairs of trips with significant arbitrage gain at github. com/asifhaque/transit-arbitrage. Finally, we point towards a uniform payment interface for different kinds of transit systems...|$|R

These lots are strategically placed outside of the “ring of congestion ” on major commuter corridors. Services offered at park-and-rides may include local fixed routes, express bus, bus rapid transit, and rail. They are designed to transfer commuters from low-occupancy modes (personal cars) to high-occupancy modes (rail, bus, van- and carpools). Services from park-and-ride lots are designed to concentrate transit demand, enabling transit services that could not otherwise be cost-effective. Typical park-and-ride amenities include covered or enclosed waiting areas, benches, and sometimes vending machines and restrooms. Lots can vary in size from 200 to over 7, 500 spaces, {{and can be used}} exclusively for transit or offer shared uses, such as vanpool staging. Transit fares from park-and-rides are typically higher than <b>basic</b> local <b>fares,</b> and parking may be free or cost a small fee...|$|R
