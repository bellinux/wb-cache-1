5|$|The team's first intra-squad {{scrimmage}} showcased Pitino's fast-paced, three-point-heavy style; the {{two teams}} combined to shoot 98-of-175 from the field, including 23-of-57 from three, as the <b>Blue</b> <b>team</b> defeated the White team 14585. Farmer led the White team (the projected reserves) in scoring with 26 points, including 5-of-13 shooting from three-point range. In the next scrimmage, played at Farmer's alma mater, Clay County High School, Farmer scored 32 points, but the White team lost to the <b>Blue</b> <b>team</b> again, 125117. The teams again combined for 175 shots, and Pitino said before the game that he wanted both teams to exceed 120 points. Farmer sat out much {{of the second half}} of the final scrimmage due to illness but scored 17 points on 5-of-16 shooting in a 124120 victory for the White team.|$|E
5|$|Twenty of the NBA Development League's {{top players}} were {{selected}} to the D-League All-Star Game rosters {{by a combination of}} fan balloting on the official D-League website and voting by the 16 head coaches of D-League teams. The selections were divided up into two teams, the Red Team and the <b>Blue</b> <b>Team,</b> by members of the NBA and NBA D-League's Basketball Operations staff. Players who have been selected by coaches and fans must be on an active roster of a D-League team. Iowa Energy head coach Nick Nurse and Austin Toros head coach Quin Snyder were selected as the coach for the Red Team and the <b>Blue</b> <b>Team</b> respectively. Both coaches earned the honor by securing the best records in the D-League through January 27.|$|E

Mike Colter portrays Locke in both Anniversary and the Nightfall origin movie, and only provided the motion-capture performance for the character in Guardians. Due to scheduling conflicts with Jessica Jones and Luke Cage, Locke's voice acting is replaced by Ike Amadi.

5|$|Along with Lou Holtz, Parseghian {{served as}} one of two honorary coaches in Notre Dame's 2007 spring game, an annual {{scrimmage}} held in April. Holtz's Gold team defeated Parseghian's <b>Blue</b> <b>team,</b> 10–6. The same year, Notre Dame unveiled a statue in Parseghian's honor by sculptor Jerry McKenna, depicting players carrying him off the field in triumph following the 1971 Cotton Bowl victory over Texas. In 2011, Miami also unveiled a statue in his honor {{to add to the}} RedHawks' Cradle of Coaches plaza. It shows him wearing a Notre Dame sweater as he kneels and looks ahead to the field.|$|E
5|$|Tarbuck {{expected}} to become {{the head of a}} naval section within GHQ, but instead found himself part of Brigadier General Stephen J. Chamberlin G-3 Section, the staff section responsible for planning and operations. He found that more than forty naval officers were working at GHQ, but they were dispersed, working in nearly every corner of the staff. Tarbuck became head of a planning group known as the Red Team. This was one of three teams; there was also a White Team under a US army officer, Colonel Peyton, and a <b>Blue</b> <b>Team</b> under an Australian Army officer, Brigadier Tom White.|$|E

5|$|The two SAS teams on-scene, Red Team and <b>Blue</b> <b>Team,</b> {{were ordered}} to begin their {{simultaneous}} assaults, under the codename Operation Nimrod, at 19:23. One group of four men from Red Team abseiled from the roof down {{the rear of the}} building, while another four-man team lowered a stun grenade through the skylight. The detonation of the stun grenade was supposed to coincide with the abseiling teams detonating explosives to gain entry to the building through the second-floor windows. Their descent had not gone according to plan and the staff sergeant leading the abseilers became entangled in his rope. While trying to assist him, one of the other soldiers had accidentally smashed a window with his foot. The noise of the breaking window alerted Oan, who was on the first floor communicating with the police negotiators, and he went to investigate. The soldiers were unable to use explosives for fear of injuring their stranded staff sergeant, but managed to smash their way into the embassy.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} three {{soldiers}} entered, a fire started and travelled up the curtains {{and out of the}} second-floor window, severely burning the staff sergeant. A second wave of abseilers cut him free, and he fell to the balcony below before entering the embassy behind the rest of his team. Slightly behind Red Team, <b>Blue</b> <b>Team</b> detonated explosives on a first-floor window, forcing Sim Harris, who had just run into the room, to take cover. Much of the operation {{at the front of the}} embassy took place in full view of the assembled journalists and was broadcast on live television, thus Harris's escape across the parapet of a first-floor balcony was famously captured on video. As the soldiers emerged onto the first-floor landing, Lock tackled Oan to prevent him attacking the SAS men. Oan, still armed, was subsequently shot dead by one of the soldiers. Meanwhile, further teams entered the embassy through the back door and cleared the ground floor and cellar. The SAS then began evacuating hostages, manhandling them down the stairs towards the back door of the embassy. Two of the terrorists were hiding amongst the hostages; one of them produced a hand grenade when he was identified. An SAS soldier, who was unable to shoot for fear of hitting a hostage or another soldier, pushed the grenade-wielding terrorist to the bottom of the stairs, where two other soldiers shot him dead.|$|E
5|$|Subsistences online {{multiplayer}} component, titled Metal Gear Online, {{consists of}} five tournament-style game modes, {{each with a}} capacity of up to eight players. This mode pits players, each playing as a generic soldier {{against each other in}} deathmatch battles and variations of capture the flag, using stages, items, maneuvers, and units (such as the KGB, GRU or Ocelot Unit) from the main game. Depending on server settings, each round the highest-scoring player in each unit automatically assumes the role of one of the main characters (or Reiko Hinomoto from Rumble Roses), along with unique abilities and/or items. For example, the highest scoring player on the GRU team would assume the role of Major Raikov, leader of the GRU, next round. Konami's Metal Gear Online service for the PlayStation 2 closed in Japan on December 26, 2006, followed by in North America on April 2, 2007 and in Europe on October 30, 2007, although a fan community has revived it by emulating the servers. As noted above, the online mode, after one of the players unlocks an animal codename, also allowed for the player to play as either Reiko Hinomoto or Rowdy Reiko from Rumble Roses (depending if the player in question was of red team or <b>blue</b> <b>team,</b> respectively). According to Metal Gear series creator Hideo Kojima, he added the characters into the game as secret characters in part due to opportunity: Kojima had earlier been offered a deal with Rumble Roses producer Akari Uchida to make a crossover between Metal Gear and Rumble Roses. However, the Metal Gear development team at the time refused to work with them. Kojima eventually accepted the offer when trying to decide on secret characters for the online mode for Subsistence to tie up loose ends. He also admitted that he originally considered offering Tomonobu Itagaki, at the time the producer of the Tecmo fighting game series Dead or Alive, the opportunity of using one of his characters as a secret character.|$|E
