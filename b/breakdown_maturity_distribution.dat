The empirical section presents new econometric evidence on the effects of these policies on expected excess holding returns (“term premia”), demonstrating that changes in the Fed’s holdings of long-term securities have had statistically significant and economically meaningful effects on the term premia associated with Treasury securities with maturities in the two- to five-year range. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{samples from}} Eocene shaly unit are {{excellent}} source rocks capable of generating hydrocarbon. The {{results of the}} modeling suggest that hydrocarbon generation from the Eocene source rocks in the Northern Delta depobelt occurred during the Paleogene–Neogene times. Regional <b>maturity</b> <b>distribution</b> and generation of oil from the Eocene source interval in the Northern Delta depobelt seems likely. Hydrocarbon generation started in the eastern and western flanks of the depobelt during Oligocene and Miocene, respectively. Short- to long-distance migration of the hydrocarbon generated from the source unit {{is expected to have}} occurred and must have charged the interbedded Eocene sand bodies and younger reservoir units; this fact corroborates production data of the wells, as sub-economical volumes of oil were recovered from the Eocene sand bodies. Possible hydrocarbon migration is expected along fault breakouts and unconformities to adjoining prolific reservoir rocks. The presence of hydrocarbon in the studied well suggests the viability of the Paleogene-sourced play in the Northern Delta depobelt. Hydrocarbon drilling activities in the Northern Delta depobelt should focus on identification of prolific reservoir sand bodies.|$|R

In order to assess the regional shale gas prospectivity of this area, a 3 D high-resolution petroleum system model has been compiled and used to reconstruct the source-rock maturation based on calibrated burial and thermal histories. Different basal heat flow scenarios and accordingly, different high-resolution scenarios of erosional amount distribution were constructed, incorporating all major uplift events that affected the study area. The model delivers an independent 3 D reappraisal of the tectonic and thermal history that controlled the differential geodynamic evolution and provides a high-resolution image of the <b>maturity</b> <b>distribution</b> and evolution throughout the study area and the different basins.

Our results indicate higher thermal maturity for samples collected in the Podolia foreland {{with respect to the}} Carpathian fold-and-thrust belt. In the Carpathian area a decreasing trend of thermal maturity can be recognized moving from Cretaceous formations to the Oligocene-Miocene ones with values comprised between the immature and mature stage of hydrocarbon generation. This trend is preserved in all the analyzed thrust sheets. This piece of evidence suggests a weak influence of tectonic loading due to thrust emplacement since Early Miocene on thermal <b>maturity</b> <b>distribution.</b> On the other hand, petrographic and mineralogical data from Podolia foreland show thermal maturity levels compatible with late diagenetic conditions. These values are not justified for an area that was not deformed by the Caledonian and Variscan orogenic phases and where structural data do not show any evidence of deformation that can justify the observed levels of thermal maturity.

Due to low or no commercial value, these species are {{most of the times}} discarded at sea, with only the larger specimens of some species commercialized at very low prices. In this study we present size <b>distributions,</b> <b>maturity</b> <b>distributions,</b> and sex ratios of 2, 138 specimens belonging to four different species, namely the lantern sharks Etmopterus pusillus and Etmopterus spinax and the catsharks Galeus melastomus and Galeus atlanticus, caught with these two gears. Trawls generally caught smaller-sized specimens, in a wider length range than longlines. Trawls caught mostly immature specimens of all species, namely 83. 7 % immature of E. pusillus, 84. 3 % of E. spinax, 89. 5 % of G. melastomus, and 95. 5 % of G. atlanticus, while longlines caught mostly immature E. pusillus (69. 2 %) and G. melastomus (78. 6 %) and mostly mature E. spinax (88. 2 %) and G. atlanticus (87. 2 %). Trawls tended to catch more males than females of all species except E. spinax, while longlines caught more females than males of E. spinax and G. melastomus and more males than females of the other two species. The main conclusion of this work is that trawls are catching smaller-sized and mostly immature specimens when compared to longlines, meaning that they are probably having a more detrimental effect on these shark populations. The data presented here have significant implications for the conservation of these shark populations since sizes, sexes, and the immature and mature components of the populations are being affected differently by these two fishing gears...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis is to {{ascertain}} the domestic causes of the Depression in Germany, and to assess their importance. In the earlier chapters I construct a simple, static, macro-economic model capable of generating those features which distinguish {{the operation of the}} German Economy during 1924 - 9, from that before 1913 or after 1948. Three sources of instability in 1924 - 9 are highlighted: the reduced willingness to hold long-term debt; the lower propensity to save; and the persistent inflationary pressures in labour and product markets. Jointly, these explain the low prices and short <b>maturity</b> <b>distribution</b> of German financial assets, the large capital imports, the Balance of Payments deficit on current account, the apparent over¬ valuation of the exchange rate, and the low rate of investment. And these together explain the especial instability of the German economy at that time. Chapters 6 to 9 consider the short-run behaviour of investment in the later 1920 s. Fluctuations of inventory investment, which had been seriously destabilising during 1924 - 7, were less significant during 1927 - 9 - The collapse of the domestic stock market in early 1927 bad identifiable effects on the fixed investment activity of the railways, communes, and smaller-scale industry. The 'closure' of foreign capital markets after mid 1928 had however no such discernible effects. The endemically low capacity utilis¬ ation, wages pressure, and the short-run nature of much invest¬ ment activity associated with expectations of lower costs of finance in the future, are more apposite explanations of the bulk of the reduction of industrial fixed investment in 1928 - 9.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the causes}} of the current crisis of the global financial system, with particular emphasis on the systemic elements that turned the crisis of subprime mortgage-backed securities in the United States, {{a small part of the}} overall system, into a worldwide crisis. The first half of the paper explains the role of mortgage securitization as a mechanism for allocating risks from real estate investments and discusses what has gone wrong and why in the implementation of this mechanism in the United States. The second half of the paper discusses the incidence of systemic risk in the crisis. Two elements of systemic risk are identified. First, there was excessive matur-ity transformation through conduits and structured-investment vehicles (SIVs); when this broke down in August 2007, the overhang of asset-backed securities that had been held by these vehi-cles put significant additional downward pressure on securities prices. Second, as the financial system adjusted to the recognition of delinquencies and defaults in US mortgages and to the <b>breakdown</b> of <b>maturity</b> transformation of conduits and SIVs, the interplay of market malfunc-tioning or even breakdown, fair value accounting and the insufficiency of equity capital at finan-cial institutions, and, finally, systemic effects of prudential regulation created a detrimenta...|$|R

40|$|The major Paleozoic {{petroleum}} {{system of}} Saudi Arabia is qualitatively {{characterized by a}} proven Silurian (Qusaiba Member, Qalibah Formation) source rock, Devonian (Jauf Formation), Permian and Carboniferous (Khuff and Unayzah Formations) reservoirs, a laterally extensive, regional Permian seal (basal Khuff clastics and Khuff evaporites), and four-way closure Hercynian structures. Hydrocarbons found in these systems include non-associated gas in Eastern Arabia and extra light oil in Central Arabia. A basin modeling approach was used to quantify {{important aspects of the}} petroleum system. First, 17 regional wells were selected to establish a reference tool for the three dimensional (3 -D) basin model using multiple one dimensional (1 -D) models. This was accomplished by studying core material from source rocks and other lithologies for thermal maturity and kerogen quality. The major emphasis was on the Silurian section, other Paleozoic intervals {{and to a lesser extent}} on the Mesozoic cover from which only few samples were studied. Although vitrinite macerals, solid bitumen, and other vitrinite-like particles were not abundant in most of the investigated samples, enough measured data established valid maturity-depth trends allowing for calibrated models of temperature history. Sensitivity analyses for maturity support the view that thermal boundary conditions and Hercynian uplift and erosion did not greatly influence the Paleozoic petroleum systems. Second, a 3 -D basin model was constructed using major geologic horizon maps spanning the whole stratigraphic column. This model was used to gain insight into the general <b>maturity</b> <b>distribution,</b> acquire a better control of the model boundary conditions and investigate charge, drainage, migration and filling history of the main Paleozoic reservoirs. The 3 -D hydrocarbon migration simulation results qualitatively account for the present gas accumulations in the Permian-Triassic Khuff and Carboniferous-Permian Unayzah reservoirs in the Ghawar area. This kind of study illustrates the importance of 3 -D basin modeling when used with other geologic data to describe petroleum systems. It provides a predictive exploratory tool for efficiently modeling hydrocarbon distribution based on seismic and well data and information on known oil and gas fields. Real earth models can only be described in 3 -D as pressure variations and fluid movements in the subsurface are impossible to address in 1 -D and 2 -D domains...|$|R

40|$|Pricing {{options on}} a stock that pays {{discrete}} dividends {{has not been}} satisfactorily settled in the literature. Frishling (2002) shows {{that there are three}} different models to model stock price with discrete dividends, but only one of these models is close to reality and generates consistent option prices. We follow Frishling (2002) by calling this model Model 3. Unfortunately, there is no analytical option pricing formula for Model 3, and many popular numerical methods such as trees are inefficient when used to implement Model 3. A new stock price model is proposed in this article. To guarantee that the option prices generated by this new model are close to those generated by Model 3, the distributions of the new model at exdividend dates and <b>maturity</b> approximate the <b>distributions</b> of Model 3 �at those dates. To achieve this, a discrete dividend in Model 3 is replaced by a continuous dividend yield that can be represented as a function of discrete dividends and stock returns in the new model. Thus, the new model follows a lognormal diffusion process and the analytical option pricing formulas can be easily derived. Numerical experiments show that our analytical pricing formulas provide accurate pricing results. ...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{consist of}} three chapters. In chapter 1, I analyze the {{equilibrium}} behavior of asset prices and margins (i. e collateral required to trade shares using debt), when Market Makers smooth out price fluctuations by trading on a margin. I address {{the questions of}} 1) whether financial margins can increase in reaction to supply shocks without misinformation about the shocks' nature, 2) when non-fundamental shocks reduce asset prices and increase margins, and 3) how margins and prices react to persistent supply shocks, as opposed to temporary ones. In the model, price fluctuations are induced by supply shocks, and margins are set to match the price depreciation induced by a future negative tail shock. Temporary shocks (i. e. shocks that fade very soon) are shown to have no effects on prices or margins, when either they are small or Market Makers hold large collateral amounts. If the shock is sufficiently large, some shares will be held by (currently active) risk averse investors, and price falls due to larger risk premium. If, before the shock, Market Makers were holding asset shares, prices fall even more, because Market Makers wealth is marked down, and expected future prices falls, since it becomes more likely that future shocks will depress prices. Persistent shocks (i. e. shocks that do not fade quickly) reduce current prices, because, in the best scenario, they shift down the future price distribution, and reduce Market Makers' asset valuation. I give conditions for margins to increase with a persistent shock. Falling prices and higher margins {{are not necessarily the}} result of a margin spiral (i. e. when margins increase and constrain Market Makers, who are forced to sell, causing prices to fall and margins increase more). Margins can increase because future price variance increases {{at the same time as}} Market Makers' asset valuation reduces, and Market Makers may not be financially constrained at all. In chapter 2, I study repurchase agreements, short-term collateralized loans known as repos, that are commonly used to fund different sorts of assets. Using a dataset of Money Market Mutual Funds (MMF), I find that repos backed by liquid collateral, such as US Treasuries securities, have on average shorter maturities, lower haircut rates and lower interest rates than less liquid collateral, while the average maturities of repos held by MMF are positively correlated with fund size and overall portfolio maturity. Motivated by these evidences, I develop an equilibrium model to price simultaneously assets and repos. I show that assortative matching between assets and lenders offering different maturities exists in equilibrium. Lenders who offer longer maturities are better suited to finance less liquidity securities, since investors' expected transaction costs are lower, as collateral (to repay debt) is sold long after their debt is considered unworthy. Liquid securities prices increase with repos, in order to make the financing of illiquid securities more attractive to long maturity lenders. Interest rates and haircuts are functions of both the transaction costs and <b>maturities</b> <b>distributions,</b> and are shown to be increasing in illiquidity. Haircuts exceed the securities' transaction costs, in order to cover how much securities depreciate when sold, and to force borrowers to repay the interest on their debt. Moreover, illiquid securities have higher haircuts, because not only they have larger transaction costs but also because the repos used to finance them pay more interest. I emulate a financial crisis through an increase in the probability of a debt run. As repos are terminated earlier, all asset prices decrease. Illiquid securities prices, however, fall notably more and haircuts and interest rates of repos to fund them increase. In chapter 3, which is co-authored with Siwei Kwok, we study the interaction of information and competition in incentivizing quality provision. We estimate a discrete quality game with Los Angeles County restaurant hygiene inspection data set, via the two step method of Bajari et al (2006). Our results suggest that firm competition incentivizes quality provision, but the effect is non-monotonic. If a market is saturated with a sufficiently large number of firms, an additional firm might actually reduces the likelihood that all others will provide quality. Information, however, enhances the effects of competition and reduces the threshold which additional firms reduce quality provided...|$|R

Here we present geochemical and biomarker {{data of the}} OAE 2 from a shelf setting situated at about 100 – 150 m water depth (Wunstorf, Germany). Our data support that processes inducing BS deposition were related to orbital cyclicity in Wunstorf {{and that they were}} not restricted to the time of the OAE 2 carbon isotope excursion. Correlations of total organic carbon (TOC) and &delta; 15 N and high relative abundances of functionalized hopanoids (including 2 -methylated structures) suggest that BS were formed during times of imbalanced nutrients with high phosphorus inputs and increased cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation. Periods of BS formation were also characterized by enhanced growth of dinoflagellates and bacteriovorous ciliates, the latter supporting the presence of a stratified water body. The lack of biomarkers specific for green sulfur bacteria excludes photic zone euxinia during OAE 2 in Wunstorf. Conflicting <b>maturities</b> and biomarker <b>distributions</b> in kerogen and extractable organic matter and, interestingly, a negative correlation of the diagenetically resistant 2 -methyl hopane hydrocarbons with TOC indicate a complex depositional setting at Wunstorf.

40|$|The {{straightforward}} anatomical organisation of {{the developing}} and mature rat spinal cord {{was used to determine}} and interpret the time of appearance and expression patterns of microtubule-associated proteins (MAP) 1 b and 2. Immunoblots revealed the presence of MAP 1 b and 2 in the early embryonic rat spinal cord and confirmed the specificity of the used anti-MAP mouse monoclonal antibodies. The immunocytochemical data demonstrated a rostral-to-caudal and ventral-to-dorsal gradient in the expression of MAP 1 b/ 2 within the developing spinal cord. In the matrix layer, MAP 1 b was found in a distinct radial pattern distributed between the membrana limitans interna and externa between embryonal day (E) 12 and E 15. Immunostaining for vimentin revealed that this MAP 1 b pattern was morphologically and topographically different from the radial glial pattern which was present in the matrix layer between E 13 and E 19. The ventral-to-dorsal developmental gradient of the MAP 1 b staining in the spinal cord matrix layer indicates a close involvement of MAP 1 b either in the organisation of the microtubules in the cytoplasmatic extensions of the proliferating neuroblasts or neuroblast mitosis. MAP 2 could not be detected in the developing matrix layer. In the mantle and marginal layer, MAP 1 b was abundantly present between E 12 and postnatal day (P) 0. After birth, the staining intensity for MAP 1 b gradually decreased in both layers towards a faint appearance at <b>maturity.</b> The <b>distribution</b> patterns suggest an involvement of MAP 1 b in the maturation of the motor neurons, the contralaterally and ipsilaterally projecting axons and the ascending and descending long axons of the rat spinal cord.

Simple linear regressions showed that the abundance of M. norvegica was positively related to temperature, salinity and phytoplankton concentration, while the abundance of T. inermis was negatively related to bathymetry. Multiple linear regression analyses did not add to this information of a positive relationship between abundance and temperature for M. norvegica, while T. inermis was shown to be negatively related to both temperature and bathymetry. During the latter half of May, the main spawning of both species was confined to the regions off the southwest coast. Sex ratio (males/females) of M. norvegica was higher in southwest than in the north and east, whereas T. inermis showed a similar sex ratio all around the island. In all regions, M. norvegica appears to have a life span of 2 -years while T. inermis of 1 -year in the southwest and possibly 2 -years in north and east...|$|R
40|$|We present {{evidence}} for {{a decline in the}} population of the American eel (Anguilla rostrata) from several widely distributed regions of North America from 1984 to 1995. Trends in population indices from commercial catch data, upstream passage counts, and seine, trawl, and electrofishing surveys were analyzed and found to be either not significant or significantly negative. Explanations for this decline, whether natural or anthropogenic, are unknown, due to variation and incompleteness in abundance data, and incomplete knowledge of eel life history, ecology, and population dynamics. A number of potential factors may be contributing to the decline, including (in alphabetical order) : barriers to migration, habitat loss and alteration, hydro turbine mortality, oceanic conditions, over-fishing, parasitism, and pollution. The paucity of life table data associated with the unconventional life history characteristics of anguillid eels (catadromy, panmixis, semelparity, high age at <b>maturity,</b> wide geographic <b>distribution,</b> and ecological generalist habit) prevents development of accurate population models and determination of overall effects influencing production and recruitment for this species. Historically there has been little attention to management of this species. A new coast-wide management initiative by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission has taken a conservative approach to limiting controllable and anthropogenic sources of mortality and enhancing recruitment and restoration of available habitat. Objectives of the plan include: improving knowledge of eel utilization through better reporting of harvest, increasing knowledge of eel population dynamics and life history, providing migratory passage and access to historic eel freshwater habitat, and monitoring of abundance levels of various eel life stages...|$|R
40|$|Extracellular {{polymeric}} substances (EPS) are ubiquitous on tidal flats but {{their impact on}} sediment erosion has not been fully understood. Laboratory-controlled sediment beds were incubated with Bacillus subtilis for 5, 10, 16 and 22 days before the erosion experiments, to study the temporal and spatial variations in sediment stability caused by the bacterial secreted EPS. We found the bio-sedimentary systems showed different erosional behaviour related to biofilm <b>maturity</b> and EPS <b>distribution.</b> In the first stage (5 days), the bio-sedimentary bed was more easily eroded than the clean sediment. With increasing growth period, bound EPS became more widely distributed over the vertical profile resulting in bed stabilisation. After 22 days, the bound EPS was highly concentrated within a surface biofilm, but a relatively high content also extended {{to a depth of}} 5 mm and then decayed sharply with depth. The biofilm increased the critical shear stress of the bed and furthermore, it enabled the bed to withstand threshold conditions for an increased period of time as the biofilm degraded before eroding. After the loss of biofilm protection, the high EPS content in the sub-layers continued to stabilise the sediment (hindered erosion) by binding individual grains, as visualized by electron microscopy. Consequently, the bed strength did not immediately revert to the abiotic condition but progressively adjusted, reflecting the depth profile of the EPS. Our experiments highlight the need to treat the EPS-sediment conditioning as a bed-age associated and depth-dependent variable that {{should be included in the}} next generation of sediment transport models...|$|R
40|$|The Nyk High is an {{approximately}} northeast-trending, Late Cretaceous {{to early}} Tertiary structural high {{situated in the}} western Vøring Basin, offshore Norway. It is defined by a thick sequence of Upper Cretaceous to lower Tertiary sediments that dip toward the southeast and are cut by normal faults with throws up to 1500 m (4921 ft). Across-fault sediment thickness variations and stratigraphic onlap relationships show that these faults were active during Campanian to early Paleocene extension, prior to the separation of Norway from Greenland ca. 55 Ma. Sediments preserved in the hanging walls of these rift-related normal faults are deformed by two populations of folds: one set is oriented clockwise of the fault strike; the other is oriented parallel to the fault strike. Stratigraphic relationships show that both sets of folds formed subsequent to rifting during the latest Paleocene to the earliest Eocene. We interpret these folds as having developed during minor sinistral transpression, which was partitioned between the northeastsouthwest sinistral strike-slip reactivation of the normal faults and the northwest-southeast coaxial shortening (folding) within the fault hanging walls. The Nyk High is oriented counterclockwise to the inferred line of the continental breakup. We speculate that transpression was driven by north-northwest forces arising from the differential topography along the incipient plate boundary {{and the presence of}} hot, buoyant material beneath this elevated axial region. Such deformation will not necessarily impact significantly on source rock <b>maturity</b> or the <b>distribution</b> of reservoir sands but can give rise to unusual structural trap geometries. It is also likely to increase the connectivity of trap-bounding faults...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} and mobilization of useful genetic variation from germplasm banks {{for use in}} breeding programs is critical for future genetic gain and protection against crop pests. Plummeting costs of next-generation sequencing and genotyping is revolutionizing {{the way in which}} researchers and breeders interface with plant germplasm collections. An example of this is the high density genotyping of the entire USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection. We assessed the usefulness of 50 K single nucleotide polymorphism data collected on 18, 480 domesticated soybean (Glycine max) accessions and vast historical phenotypic data for developing genomic prediction models for protein, oil, and yield. Resulting genomic prediction models explained an appreciable amount of the variation in accession performance in independent validation trials, with correlations between predicted and observed reaching up to 0. 92 for oil and protein and 0. 79 for yield. The optimization of training set design was explored using a series of cross-validation schemes. It was found that the target population and environment need to be well represented in the training set. Second, genomic prediction training sets appear to be robust to the presence of data from diverse geographical locations and genetic clusters. This finding, however, depends on the influence of shattering and lodging, and may be specific to soybean with its presence of <b>maturity</b> groups. The <b>distribution</b> of 7608 nonphenotyped accessions was examined through the application of genomic prediction models. The distribution of predictions of phenotyped accessions was representative of the distribution of predictions for nonphenotyped accessions, with no nonphenotyped accessions being predicted to fall far outside the range of predictions of phenotyped accessions...|$|R
40|$|In {{times of}} rapidly growing energy demands {{petroleum}} exploration focus has shifted {{more and more}} towards unconventional petroleum systems due to increasing difficulties in finding and profitably producing from conventional oil and gas fields but also due to recent increases in gas price and enhanced recovery techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic stimulation which allow production from these tight low-permeable reservoirs. Based on the successful exploration of and production from U. S. American shale gas/oil plays it was discussed whether similarly successful plays would also be available in Europe. In this context, sedimentary basins in NW-Germany and the Netherlands represent amongst others potential targets for shale gas exploration in Europe due {{to the presence of}} Cretaceous (Wealden) and Jurassic (Posidonia) marlstones/shales as well as various Carboniferous black shales. Unlike in conventional reservoirs in which gas is stored primarily as compressed (“free”) gas in the intragranular pore space and fractures, a significant proportion of gas in shales can be stored as “sorbed” gas. The sorption of hydrocarbon gas (mostly methane) in shales provides gas storage capacity in addition to the “free gas” capacity in the pore system. The methane sorption is considered to take place predominantly within the microporous organic matter (kerogen) and is controlled by the Total Organic Carbon (TOC), kerogen type, maturity, water saturation and to some extent by the inorganic constituents (clay minerals). Numerical petroleum system modeling provides the only means to combine results from different geological, geochemical and geophysical analysis methods within the frame of a 4 D thermo-tectonic reconstruction of the basin´s evolution. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} combine basin and petroleum system modeling approaches with petrophysical as well as petrographic methods in order to substantiate former assumptions on the geodynamic evolution of the study area providing a reasonable assessment of the regional shale gas prospectivity and thus reducing potential exploration risks prior to drilling. For this, 3 D high resolution petroleum system models of NW-Germany and the Netherlands have been compiled and used to reconstruct the source rock maturation based on calibrated burial and thermal histories. Different basal heat flow scenarios and accordingly different high-resolution scenarios of erosional amount distribution were constructed, representing all major uplift events that affected the study area. The models deliver an independent reappraisal of the tectonic and thermal history that controlled the differential geodynamic evolution and provide a high-resolution image of the <b>maturity</b> <b>distribution</b> and evolution throughout the study area and the different basins. Pressure, temperature and TOC-dependent gas storage capacity and gas contents of different potential source rocks were calculated based on experimentally derived Langmuir sorption parameters and newly compiled source rock thickness maps. With additional petrographic analysis methods assessing the lithological dependency of vitrinite reflectance as a maturity parameter in high rank sedimentary rocks as well as utilizing its anisotropic character (at maturity levels above 2 % VRr) as stress/strain indicator this study can also contribute to the understanding of burial and temperature history in the Lower Saxony Basin. RIS (Reflectance Indicating Surface) analysis shows a predominantly negative biaxial distribution of vitrinite reflectance indicating the absence of thermal overprinting by a possible magmatic intrusion (Bramsche Massif) during the Upper Cretaceous but, in addition to vertical stresses due to depositional loading, the presence of a secondary stress field not perpendicular to bedding and related to the inversion of the Lower Saxony Basin. This basin belongs to an en-echelon shaped basin sub-system of similar geodynamic evolution which can be tracked throughout the whole Central European Basin System (CEBS). One of the most distinctive aspects of its evolution is the dominant uplift and partial inversion during the Upper Cretaceous ultimately controlling source rock maturation, petroleum generation, migration and trapping. Especially in the Lower Saxony Basin deep subsidence was followed by strong uplift with maximum amounts of up to 6800 - 8900 m of eroded basin infill during the Subhercynian inversion depending on the modeled basal heat flow trend. Modeling results indicate maturity patterns of the most important petroleum source rocks and also prospective areas within the study area exhibiting shale gas potential at present-day. These areas are confined to the Lower Saxony Basin, southern Gifhorn Trough and West Netherlands Basin. For the Posidonia Shale in the Lower Saxony Basin low bulk adsorption capacities (note that bulk adsorption capacities are given for the total layer thickness within a grid cell size of 1 km 2) of about 0. 16 * 106 tons and gas contents of up to 82 scf/ton rock have been predicted. The capacities at the northern and eastern boundaries of the Lower Saxony Basin, Pompeckj Basin and Gifhorn Trough range around 0. 3 * 106 tons. In the West Netherlands Basin, capacities range between 0. 14 - 0. 31 * 106 tons. In the southern area of the Gifhorn Trough and southwestern flank of the West Netherlands Basin average gas contents of up to 95 scf/ton rock have been predicted. Bulk adsorption capacity of the Wealden is proportional to the varying layer thickness and ranges up to 3. 45 * 106 tons. Gas contents have been calculated for the Ems river area with values up to 26 scf/ton rock and the Hunte river area with contents up to 45 scf/ton rock...|$|R
40|$|Title page, {{abstract}} and {{table of contents}} only. The complete thesis in print form {{is available from the}} University of Adelaide Library. The Officer Basin is a Neoproterozoic Basin located in Central Australia. This study looks at the unconventional prospectivity of the source rocks in the depocentres of the Officer Basin. The Savory, Gibson, Yowalga, Gibson and Lennis sub-basins are located in the Western Australian section of the Officer Basin. The Birksgate Trough, and the Munyarai, Tallaringa, and Manya Troughs, are located in the South Australian section of the Officer Basin. The Munyarai Trough contains the Observatory Hill Formation, the most prospective source rock in the Officer Basin. In the region of the Marla Overthrust Zone on the northern margin of the Munyarai Trough, the Observatory Hill Formation is the most prospective region for shale gas continuous accumulations. The thrust faulting in the Marla Overthrust Zone, and also in the Yowalga Sub-Basin, in combination with salt diapirism in these zones, poses a risk to the lateral continuity of a continuous accumulation of shale gas in these regions. The Officer Basin contains pre-Devonian source rocks which are devoid of plant material, containing algal-sourced hydrocarbons. Triaromatic hydrocarbons such as methylphenanthrene can be exploited as a measure of <b>maturity</b> and <b>distribution,</b> and have been used to map the maturity of the source rocks in the basin. The sampled data available in the underexplored Officer Basin indicates that the basin is a high risk exploration target for continuous gas accumulations. The sampled data indicates that the Officer Basin shale formations do not meet the minimum requirements outlined by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) for highly productive shale gas. However due to the limited sampling and exploration undertaken in the Officer Basin, there may exist other regions outside of those sampled that have the characteristics that do meet the USGS minimum requirements for highly productive shale gas systems. Three key findings of this investigation include: • The Officer Basin is a very high risk exploration target for shale gas continuous petroleum accumulations, and sampling has not been shown to meet all of the USGS minimum requirements for a highly productive shale gas system. • The Yowalga Sub-basin and the Marla Overthrust Zone contain thrust faulting and salt piercement structures related to halotectonics, affecting the lateral distribution of any continuous accumulations that may occur in the region. • The Officer Basin is underexplored, particularly in the Savory, Lennis, Gibson, Waigen and Birksgate Sub-basins, and should not be excluded from potentially hosting formations which may meet the USGS minimum requirements of a shale gas system.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the geology of the Daspoort Formation (Pretoria Group, Transvaal Supergroup) of South Africa, with the accent on describing and interpreting its sedimentology. The Palaeoproterozoic Daspoort Formation (c. 2. 1 ‐ 2. 2 Ga) forms {{part of the}} Pretoria Group on the Kaapvaal craton. This sandstone‐ and quartzite‐dominated lithological formation covers an elliptical geographical area stretching from the Botswana border {{in the west to}} the Drakensberg escarpment in the east, with its northern limit in the Mokopane (Potgietersrus) area and Pretoria in the south; altered outliers are also found in the overturned units of the Vredefort dome in the Potchefstroom area. Deposition of the Daspoort Formation was in a postulated intracratonic basin which applies equally to the entire Transvaal Supergroup succession in the Transvaal depository. Various characteristics from the formation, such as sedimentary architectural elements (e. g., channel–fills etc.), <b>maturity</b> trends and <b>distribution</b> of lithofacies assemblages across the preserved basin give insight into the developing conditions during deposition and genesis of the Daspoort Formation. Subordinate evidence from basic geochemistry, ripple mark data and optical microscope petrology studies support the sedimentary setting inferred for this Palaeoproterozoic deposit. Fluvial and epeiric marine conditions prevailed during the deposition of the Daspoort clastic sediments into the intracratonic basin. This shallow epeiric sea was fed by fluvial influx, predominantly from the west when a transgressive regional systems tract led to the filling of the basin, evolving into the deeper marine Silverton Formation setting, laid down above the Daspoort. Transgression from the east (marine facies predominate) to the west (fluvial facies) is supported by cyclical trends, palaeoenvironmental and palaeogeographical interpretations. Accompanying poorly preserved microbial mat features contribute to the postulated shallow marine environment envisaged for {{the eastern part of the}} basin whereas ripple marks and grain size distribution support a fluvial setting for the west, with lithofacies assemblages accounting for both areas’ depositional interpretation.
