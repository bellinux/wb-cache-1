Fred Bronson from Billboard reported that although the song had moved up the chart with a positive <b>bullet</b> <b>point,</b> the song being a risky choice for radio, it stalled progress and failed to become Madonna's 33rd top 40 hit.

By their own admission, the pitch was vague and they had deliberately toned down the creative aspect of the game—which they felt may have appeared as [...] "weird" [...] for a console game—for fear of negative reception of their pitch by Sony. They presented the prototype purely as a playable game, and only briefly mentioned the user created content aspect; Evans relates that Harrison actually {{picked up on the}} creative side, and had asked them why they had chosen not to explore this element further. The meeting, which had been scheduled to last 45 minutes, eventually lasted 3 hours at the end of which, Sony agreed to fund the project for six months. After some further development, the team were asked to present what they had done to Sony in what Healey describes as a [...] "Dragons' Den style scenario". Following this, Sony gave them a deal to develop LittleBigPlanet for the PlayStation 3 in exchange for exclusivity and ownership of the intellectual property. Media Molecule became incorporated as a company in February 2006.|$|E
