500|$|In higher organisms (like people), {{these two}} modes of {{perception}} combine into what Whitehead terms [...] "symbolic reference", which links appearance with causation {{in a process}} that is so automatic that both people and animals have difficulty refraining from it. [...] <b>By</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>illustration,</b> Whitehead uses the example of a person's encounter with a chair. [...] An ordinary person looks up, sees a colored shape, and immediately infers that it is a chair. [...] However, an artist, Whitehead supposes, [...] "might not have jumped to the notion of a chair", but instead [...] "might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and a beautiful shape." [...] This is not the normal human reaction; most people place objects in categories by habit and instinct, without even thinking about it. [...] Moreover, animals do the same thing. [...] Using the same example, Whitehead points out that a dog [...] "would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such." [...] In this way symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions {{on the one hand and}} causal relations on the other, and that it is in fact the causal relationships that dominate the more basic mentality (as the dog illustrates), while it is the sense perceptions which indicate a higher grade mentality (as the artist illustrates).|$|E

6000|$|Now Hegel {{accepted}} as genuine the facts which we here adduce merely {{for the sake}} <b>of</b> argument, and <b>by</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>illustrations.</b> But he did not regard the clairvoyant consciousness (or whatever we call it) which, ex hypothesi, is untrammelled by space, or even by time, as occupying what we style {{the upper end of}} the psychical spectrum. On the contrary, he placed it at the lower end. Hegel's upper end 'loses itself in light;' the lower end, qui voit tant de choses, as La Fontaine's shepherd says, is not 'a sublime mental phase, and capable of conveying general truths.' Time and space do not thwart the consciousness at Hegel's lower end, which springs from 'the great soul of nature.' But that lower end, though it may see for Jeanne d'Arc at Valcouleurs a battle at Rouvray, a hundred leagues away, does not communicate any lofty philosophic truths.[14] The phenomena of clairvoyance, in Hegel's opinion, merely indicate that the 'material' is really 'ideal,' which, perhaps, is as much as we can ask from them. 'The somnambulist and clairvoyant see without eyes, and carry their visions directly into regions where the waiting consciousness of orderly intelligence cannot enter' (Wallace). Hegel admits, however, that 'in ordinary self-possessed conscious life' there are traces of the 'magic tie,' 'especially between female friends of delicate nerves,' to whom he adds husband and wife, and members of the same family. He gives (without date or source) a case of a girl in Germany who saw her brother lying dead in a hospital at Valladolid. Her brother was at the time in the hospital, but it was another man in the nest bed who was dead. 'It is thus impossible to make out whether what the clairvoyants really see preponderates over what they deceive themselves in.' ...|$|R
