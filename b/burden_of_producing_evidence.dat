50|$|The basic {{outline of}} a section 7 {{horizontal}} acquisition case is familiar.

The <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>producing</b> <b>evidence</b> to rebut this presumption then shifts to the defendant. If the defendant successfully rebuts the presumption, the burden of producing additional evidence of anticompetitive effect shifts to the government, and merges with the ultimate burden of persuasion, which remains with the government at all times.|$|E

Because this defense simply shows that an element of the offense (knowledge {{of the nature of the}} substance) is not present, the defendant does not have any <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> persuasion with regard to a negating defense.

40|$|Generally speaking, three burdens can {{be imposed}} upon {{a party at}} trial: the burden of {{pleading}}, the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>producing</b> <b>evidence,</b> and the burden of persuasion. Burdens of pleading specify {{the conditions under which}} factual/legal issues will be deemed to be included within a litigated case. They can be distributed any way the law maker prefers, although usually they are allocated to the party asking for a change in the status quo. There are exceptions to this general rule designed to respond to this or that policy concern, such as the requirement that criminal defendants plead specifically an alibi even though an 'alibi' is nothing but a general denial. Burdens of pleading are significant in that they create the scaffold of the trial; but they pose no interesting conceptual challenge, and thus they can be put asid...|$|E
40|$|Adjudicative tribunals in both {{criminal}} and noncriminal cases {{rely on the}} concept of the 2 ̆ 2 burden of proof 2 ̆ 2 to resolve uncertainty about facts. Perhaps surprisingly, this concept remains clouded and deeply controver­ sial. Written by an internationally renowned scholar, this book explores contemporary thinking on the evidential requirements that are critical for all practical decision making, including adjudication. Although the idea that evidence must favor one side over the other to a specified degree, such as 2 ̆ 2 beyond reasonable doubt; 2 ̆ 7 is familiar, less well understood is an idea associated with the work ofJohn Maynard Keynes, namely, that there are requirements on the total amount of evidence considered to decide a case. The author expertly explores this distinct Keynesian concept and its impli­ cations. Hypothetical examples and litigated cases are included to assist understanding of the ideas developed. Implications include an expanded conception of the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>producing</b> <b>evidence</b> and how it should be administered...|$|E

40|$|In this Article, I offer a {{fundamentally}} different and nondoctrinaire way of approaching hearsay questions. In brief, I take {{the view that}} the resolution of a hearsay dispute, when the declarant is not on the stand, is essentially a matter of deciding who should bear the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>producing</b> the declarant, or more precisely, how courts should allocate that burden. Adopting a simple procedural improvement, concerning the examination of the declarant if she is produced as a witness, allows the court to allocate the burden optimally. If live testimony by the declarant would be more probative than prejudicial, then most often-contrary to standard doctrine-the hearsay also is more probative than prejudicial. When this is so, the court ordinarily ought to impose the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>producing</b> the declarant on the opponent, the party objecting to the hearsay. Sometimes, though, other considerations-such as whether the proponent has a substantial advantage in satisfying all or part <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>producing</b> the declarant, or whether the proponent has given late notice of his intention to offer the hearsay-may warrant imposing part or all <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> on the proponent...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze leading {{criminal}} cases {{taken from the}} Supreme Court of the United States, in which ad hominem arguments played a crucial role. We show that although such character attack arguments {{can be used for}} legitimate purposes in legal argumentation, in many cases they are weak arguments, but so persuasive that they can effectively prejudice the judgment of a jury. Their dangerous and prejudicial effect {{can be used as a}} fundamental component of more complex strategies, aimed, for instance, at shifting the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>producing</b> <b>evidence</b> or proving character. Using argumentation schemes, we provide criteria for establishing the reasonableness and the weaknesses of this type of argument in different circumstances. We show how ad hominem arguments can be used legitimately as undercutters aimed at undermining the conditions on w hich arguments from a source (such as arguments from expert testimony) are based. We explain the rhetorical persuasiveness of personal attacks by revealing their structure as complex strategies that fit clusters of arguments together to arouse different types of emotions...|$|E

Specifically, we constructed a synthetic quorum-sensing system with designated "Sender" and "Receiver" cells in Bacillus subtilis. This synthetic QS system allowed us to uncouple and independently investigate ECM production and QS in both biofilms and single cells. Results revealed that ECM production directly enhances the response to QS signals, which may offset the cost of ECM production...|$|R
