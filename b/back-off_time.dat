A half-duplex Ethernet network populated with a small/medium number of Media Access Controllers (MACs) is used for timed real-time communication. Data packages are sent at well defined times to avoid collisions. Collisions mainly occur due to jitter of the transmitter system, so that arbitration (similar to CANopen) is necessary. In this paper, simulation models using a Binary Exponential Backoff (BEB) scheme and a Linear Backoff scheme are developed. This paper analyzes and investigates how the backoff time affects the performance of the Carrier Sense Multiple Access protocol with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) in a basic Media Access Controller (MAC), in terms of data arrival characteristics, i. e jitter and delay.

40|$|Bandwidth {{reservation}} for real-time networks {{offers an}} approach for real-time networking in a switched Ethernet or IP setting. In a switched network, switches prevent from indeterministic <b>back-off</b> <b>times</b> at collisions and here bandwidth reservation limits send rates to protects from overallocation of link bandwidth. The {{work in this}} paper aims at avoiding problems with a centralized bandwidth broker for resource reservation for bandwidth in a throttled real-time network. A centralized broker (such as a ’GlobeThrottle’) is a {{single point of failure}} in a distributed system and is also a hot-spot resource, which all nodes of the system use for registering new real-time channels. To avoid both these problems we propose a distributed algorithm to be used instead of a central bandwidth broker. Also, the GlobeThrottle approach uses TCP/IP communication for channel allocation, which gives indeterministic time channel allocation. However, this problem is not addressed in this paper. In the proposed solution, Real-time Communication Through a Distributed Resource Reservation Approach (STRUTS), real-time channels are throttled and the throttle level for each sending node is agreed between all nodes. The agreement must be atomic to avoid transitional bandwidth over-usage due to temporary inconsistencies between nodes (’mutual inconsistencies’) in throttling level information for different nodes. In this paper we use two-phase-commit (2 PC) for atomic node agreements, where changes in channels information will be visible at the same time instant at all nodes. Thus, the throttling based on the agreed channel information will guarantee that the maximal bandwidth is not exceeded. Using a distributed agreement avoids the problems of a single point of failure and hot-spot behavior, and is thus scalable to some extent. However, 2 PC commitment incurs other problems with scalability since it requires that the network is not partitioned and also that nodes are locked during the agreement process, which prevents other nodes from allocating channels for the same node concurrently. When using 2 PC for agreement {{it is not possible to}} have deterministic channel allocation time when there are no guarantees for the maximum locking time on the channel data. We have through experimental results veriﬁed that by using STRUTS, we avoid overallocation of links...|$|R

3000|$|... [46] aims {{to improve}} spatial channel reuse {{and this is}} done by distributing traffic among {{intermediate}} nodes in a more balanced way. In the current IEEE 802.11 protocol, a node is constrained from contending for the channel by a random back-off period, plus a single packet transmission time that is announced by the RTS or CTS frame. However, the contention related drops caused by the exposed receivers problem persists {{due to the lack}} of coordination between nodes that are two hops away from each other. To solve this problem, AP lets some nodes wait, in addition to the normal back-off period, for an extra amount of time equal to a packet transmission time when necessary. AP is used in coordination with Link RED as follows. When a node finds its average number of transmission retries to be less than a threshold, it calculates its <b>back-off</b> <b>time</b> as usual. When the average number of retries goes beyond this threshold, Link RED will start to mark packets and AP will then increase the <b>back-off</b> <b>time</b> of the pending transmission by an interval equal to the transmission time of the previous packet. Link RED provides an early sign of network overload, which helps TCP improve the interflow fairness between multiple TCP sessions. When Link RED is used in conjunction with AP, they improve the spatial reuse by reducing contention and, thus, improve the TCP performance. However, in this approach, the additional <b>back-off</b> <b>time</b> is based on the packet size, therefore, existence of different data packets size in the network should be inspected. Moreover, Link RED requires the MAC layer to maintain an average transmission retry attempt value. It also requires a RED-like algorithm to be implemented at the MAC layer, and this complicates the implementation and the deployment of the scheme.|$|E

In the EA-MAC, node correlation analysis algorithm and traffic adaptive duty cycle mechanism are added. Meanwhile, the residual energy is introduced into the existing traffic adaptive back-off mechanism to measure the saving efficiency. In the node correlation algorithm, all network nodes are divided into several areas by computing node correlation according to the collected information. The clustering mechanism is applied for choosing representative node in each area for transmitting data. This method can effectively reduce redundant nodes transmitting duplicate data. In traffic adaptive duty cycle mechanism, the duty cycle is regulated dynamically to decrease idle listening by comparing the threshold set with the flow value obtained from the predict flow model. In back-off mechanisms, by adjusting the value of contention window and <b>back-off</b> <b>time,</b> data collisions can be effectively avoided when network traffic is heavy. In addition, nodes with more remaining energy have priority to access the channel and have shorter <b>back-off</b> <b>time,</b> which can keep the balance of the whole network energy consumption and lengthen network lifetime.
