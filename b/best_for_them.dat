He explained that he did not search for a similarly trained singer as a successor for Turunen because he considers her to be extraordinarily good in her genre and therefore irreplaceable.

The jingle used in her first two {{commercials}} for the company were composed by A.B. and Chris Pérez—the latter of whom had joined Selena y Los Dinos several months earlier as the band's new guitarist. Pérez began having romantic feelings for Selena, despite having a girlfriend in San Antonio. After a trip down to Mexico with the band, Pérez thought it would be <b>best</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> both to distance himself from her, but he found that impossible and chose to try to build a relationship with her. They expressed their feelings for each other at a Pizza Hut restaurant, and shortly afterwards became a couple. Pérez and Selena hid their relationship, fearing Quintanilla, Jr. would try to break it up.|$|E

After one of his solo shows in the Boston area, Ian Hultquist, who was attending Berklee College of Music at the time, approached Angelakos and expressed interest in creating and playing music collaboratively. They formed a group that consisted of Angelakos, Hultquist, Ayad Al Adhamy, Thom Plasse (bass), and Adam Lavinsky (drums). The band spent {{a considerable amount of}} time trying to flesh out a collaborative format and structure that would work <b>best</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> Jeff Apruzzese and Nate Donmoyer joined the band shortly after they signed to Frenchkiss in 2008, replacing Plasse and Lavinsky, respectively.

2500|$|Historians {{since the}} late 20th century have debated how women shared in the French Revolution and what {{long-term}} impact it had on French women. Women had no political rights in pre-Revolutionary France; they were considered [...] "passive" [...] citizens; forced to rely on men to determine what was <b>best</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> That changed dramatically in theory as there seemingly were great advances in feminism. [...] Feminism emerged in Paris {{as part of a}} broad demand for social and political reform. The women demanded equality for men and then moved on to a demand for the end of male domination. Their chief vehicle for agitation were pamphlets and women's clubs, but the clubs were abolished in October 1793 and their leaders were arrested. The movement was crushed. Devance explains the decision in terms of the emphasis on masculinity in a wartime situation, Marie Antoinette's bad reputation for feminine interference in state affairs, and traditional male supremacy. A decade later the Napoleonic Code confirmed and perpetuated women's second-class status.|$|E

He also noted that the Apuestas match was [...] "awesome" [...] and that the main event was a great match despite a couple of clunky spots." [...] He also noted that the PPV broadcast suffered from several technical issues, primarily with the sound on the English commentary and occasionally also issues with the picture quality.

James Caldewell of the Pro Wrestling Torch noted that the cage match [...] "felt disorganized with so many people involved and a lot of standing around". Following the conclusion of the main event he commented that [...] "more aimed at the live audience than translating to PPV". His final conclusion was [...] " [...] Not a recommended PPV. The last two matches had star-power and stories to carry the event once the technical difficulties were worked out, but the live atmosphere and significance of the event just did not seem to translate to PPV". Richard Gallegos, when writing an editorial for SuperLuchas Magazine, called Triplemanía XXIII [...] "a disaster", both due to technical issues but also {{due to the fact that}} they were presenting a show to the US audience which have very little back story or build to four of the six matches, citing the Los Villanos/Los Psycho Circus match as one of the worst matches of the year.

He gave the Los Villanos/Los Psycho Circus match a [...] "minus five star" [...] rating, calling it [...] "one of the worst matches [...] ever seen". He gave the main event three and three quarter stars out of five, his highest rating of the night. Meltzer, who had been approached by AAA to work as part of the English announcing team for the event, also stated that while he had sympathy for the announcers for the technical issues, he would not want them back, calling Matt Striker [...] "terrible throughout" [...] and stating that Hugo Savinovich was [...] "off his game" [...] in regard to clueing fans in on the storylines behind the matches. Readers of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter voted the match between Los Psycho Circus and Los Villanos the 2015 Worst Match of the Year and the entire event as the Worst Major Wrestling Show.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1891, Chamberlain visited Bosnia and Herzegovina as a journalist. In 1878, the Ottoman {{provinces of}} Bosnia-Herzegovina were {{occupied}} by Austria-Hungary; {{though the two}} provinces remained nominally Ottoman until 1908, in practice {{they were part of}} the Austrian empire from 1878 onwards. Because Bosnia-Herzegovina was still officially part of the Ottoman Empire, neither province was represented in the Austrian Reichsrat or the Hungarian Diet, and instead the two provinces were in practice a colony of Austria-Hungary. Chamberlain had been commissioned by the Austrian government to write propaganda glorying its colonial rule of Bosnia-Herzegovina for a Geneva newspaper. Chamberlain's Bosnia articles reveal his increasing preference for dictatorship over democracy with Chamberlain praising the Austrians for having utterly no democratic aspects to their rule of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Chamberlain wrote that what he had seen in Bosnia-Herzegovina was the perfect example of Wagner's dictum: [...] "Absolute monarch-free people!" [...] Chamberlain declared that the Bosnians were extremely lucky not to have the shambles and chaos of a democratic [...] "parliamentary regime", instead being ruled by an idealist, enlightened dictatorship that did what was <b>best</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> Equally important in Chamberlain's Bosnian articles was his celebration of [...] "natural man" [...] who lived on the land as a small farmer as opposed to what Chamberlain saw as the corrupt men who lived in modern industrial, urban society. At the time Chamberlain visited Bosnia-Herzegovina, the provinces had been barely touched by modernization, and for the most part, Bosnians continued to live much as their ancestors had done in the Middle Ages. Chamberlain was enchanted with what he saw, and forgetting for the moment that the purpose of his visit was to glorify Austrian rule, expressed much sadness in his articles that the [...] "westernization" [...] being fostered by the Austrians would destroy the traditional way of life in Bosnia. Chamberlain wrote about the average Bosnian: He [...] builds his house, he makes his shoes, and plough, etc; the woman weaves and dyes the stuffs and cooks the food. When we have civilized these good people, when we have taken from them their beautiful costumes to be preserved in museums as objects of curiosity, when we have ruined their national industries that are so perfect and so primitive, when contact with us has destroyed the simplicity of their manner-then Bosnia will no longer be interesting to us. Chamberlain's awe and pride in the tremendous scientific and technological advances of the 19th century were always tempered with an extremely strong nostalgia for what he saw as the simpler, better and more innocent time when people lived on the land in harmony with nature. In his heart, Chamberlain was always a romantic conservative who idealised the Middle Ages and was never quite comfortable with the changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution. In Bosnia, Chamberlain saw an essentially medieval society that still moved to the ancient rhythm of life that epitomized his pastoral ideal. Remembering Bosnia several years later, Chamberlain wrote: The spirit of a natural man, who does everything and must create everything for himself in life, is decidedly more universal and more harmoniously developed than the spirit of an industrial worker whose whole life is occupied with the manufacturing of a single object…and that only with the aid of a complicated machine, whose functioning is quite foreign to him. A similar degeneration is taking place amongst peasants: an American farmer in the Far West is today only a kind of subordinate engine driver. Also among us in Europe it becomes every day more impossible for a peasant to exist, for agriculture must be carried out in [...] "large units"-the peasant consequently becomes increasingly like an industrial worker. His understanding dries up; there is no longer an interaction between his spirit and surrounding Nature. Chamberlain's nostalgia for a pre-industrial way of life that he expressed so strongly in his Bosnia articles earned him ridicule as many believed that he had an absurdly idealized and romanticized view of the rural life that he never experienced first-hand.|$|E
