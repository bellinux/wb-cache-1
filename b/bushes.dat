5|$|A {{study of}} {{vigilance}} behaviour of herds revealed that individuals on {{the borders of}} herds {{tend to be more}} cautious; vigilance decreases with group size. Group size and distance from roads and <b>bushes</b> were found to have major influence on vigilance, more among the grazing springbok than among their browsing counterparts. Adults were found to be more vigilant than juveniles, and males more vigilant than females. Springbok passing through <b>bushes</b> tend to be more vulnerable to predator attacks as they can not be easily alerted, and predators usually conceal themselves in <b>bushes.</b> Another study calculated that the time spent in vigilance by springbok on the edges of herds is roughly double that spent by those in the centre and the open. Springbok were found to be more cautious in the late morning than at dawn or in the afternoon, and more at night than in the daytime. Rates and methods of vigilance were found to vary with the aim of lowering risk from predators.|$|E

5|$|Problems with moving {{dunes and}} {{desertification}} were subsequently {{brought under control}} in the latter 19th and early 20th centuries by establishing large plantations of grasses, <b>bushes</b> and fir trees.

5|$|The {{state of}} grizzly bear populations in Banff {{is seen as}} a proxy for {{ecological}} integrity. To keep bears away from humans, an electric fence was put up around the summer gondola and parking lot at Lake Louise in 2001.

The fruit of Buffaloberry <b>bushes</b> is eaten by bears, so the <b>bushes</b> have been removed in some areas where the risk of a bear–human encounter is high.|$|E

5|$|This sparrow {{is found}} in open oak {{woodlands}} and dry uplands with grassy vegetation and <b>bushes.</b> It is often found near rocky outcroppings.

5|$|To {{help the}} {{existing}} colonies rebound, several private {{projects have been}} initiated {{in an attempt to}} limit the encroachment of overshadowing trees and <b>bushes,</b> the construction of new highways and neighborhoods, and other natural and man-made threats.|$|E
5|$|Two-year-old <b>bushes</b> {{are usually}} planted but strong one-year-old stock {{can also be}} used. Planting {{certified}} stock avoids the risk of introducing viruses. On a garden scale the plants can be set at intervals of 1.5 to 1.8 metres (5 to 6ft) or they can be set in rows with planting intervals of 1.2 metres (4ft) and row separations of 2.5 metres (8ft) or more. In the UK, young <b>bushes</b> are generally planted deeper than their initial growing level to encourage new stems to grow from the base.|$|E

5|$|Although it is a mimid, {{the black}} catbird {{is not known}} to imitate any other species. Its song {{is a mix of}} harsh notes and clear flute-like whistles, with the phrases repeated. It builds a cup nest in low <b>bushes</b> or trees, and lays two bluish eggs. It is {{threatened}} by habitat loss, and has been assessed as near threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5|$|At higher {{elevations}} above the lake (especially in rocky or exposed locations), the pine and fir tree forests are thinner, {{and the trees}} grow in a more stunted fashion; instead, shrubs and <b>bushes,</b> such as green manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula), dwarf mountain manzanita (Arctostaphylos neuadensis), and tan oak (Lithocarpus densiflorus) find areas and niches to grow.|$|E
5|$|Cape sparrows {{prefer to}} roost in nests, and while {{wandering}} {{outside of the}} breeding season, birds in uncultivated areas roost socially in old nests or dense <b>bushes.</b> In farmland and towns, Cape sparrows build special nests for roosting, lined more poorly than breeding nests but incorporating a greater quantity of insulating material.|$|E

5|$|Crickets {{are found}} in many habitats. Members of several subfamilies {{are found in}} the upper tree canopy, in <b>bushes,</b> and among grasses and herbs. They also occur on the ground and in caves, and some are subterranean, {{excavating}} shallow or deep burrows. Some make galleries in rotting wood, and certain beach-dwelling species can run and jump over the surface of pools.|$|E
5|$|In {{his spare}} time, Wright {{developed}} a fruit farm {{on the property}} with over a thousand fruit trees and <b>bushes</b> that he ordered from Jens Jensen in 1912. It is unknown exactly how many were planted, because part of the order was destroyed during a railroad strike. Wright requested two hundred and eighty-five apple trees planted, including one hundred McIntosh, fifty Wealthy, fifty Golden Russet, and fifty Fameuse. Among the <b>bushes</b> were three hundred gooseberry, two hundred blackberry, and two hundred raspberry. The property also grew pears, asparagus, rhubarb, and plums. The fruit and vegetable plants were placed along the contour of the estate, {{which may have been}} done to mimic the farms he saw while in Italy. Wright also dammed a creek on the property to create an artificial lake, which was stocked with fish and aquatic fowl. This water garden, probably inspired by the ones he saw in Japan, created a natural gateway to the property.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also said}} that on the {{southern}} side of the track stood cliffs that overlooked the pass. However, a glance at any photograph of the pass shows there are no cliffs, only steep slopes covered in thorny <b>bushes</b> and trees.
