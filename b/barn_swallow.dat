5|$|The genus Ptyonoprogne {{is closely}} related to the larger swallow genus Hirundo into which it is often subsumed, but a DNA {{analysis}} showed that an enlarged Hirundo genus should contain all the mud-builder genera, including the Delichon house martins, a practice which few authorities follow. Although the nests of the Ptyonoprogne crag martins resembles those of typical Hirundo species like the <b>barn</b> <b>swallow,</b> the research showed that if Delichon, Cecropis and Petrochelidon are split from Hirundo, Ptyonoprogne should be also considered as a separate genus.|$|E
5|$|Though human {{activities}} {{have allowed the}} expansion of a few species, such as the <b>barn</b> <b>swallow</b> and European starling, they have caused population decreases or extinction in many other species. Over a hundred bird species have gone extinct in historical times, although the most dramatic human-caused avian extinctions, eradicating an estimated 750–1800 species, occurred during the human colonisation of Melanesian, Polynesian, and Micronesian islands. Many bird populations are declining worldwide, with 1,227 species listed as threatened by BirdLife International and the IUCN in 2009.|$|E

50|$|In <b>barn</b> <b>swallows,</b> {{the length}} of the male's tail is used as a signal of mate quality: males with longer tails are {{preferred}} to those with shorter tails. Research has found that, in a population of <b>barn</b> <b>swallows</b> infested by the parasite Ornithonyssus bursa, male <b>barn</b> <b>swallows</b> with fewer mites also had longer tails.|$|R

5|$|Because Ireland became {{isolated}} from mainland Europe by rising sea levels {{before the last}} ice age had completely finished, it has fewer land animal and plant species than Great Britain, which separated later, or mainland Europe. There are 55 mammal species in Ireland and of them only 26 land mammal species are considered native to Ireland. Some species, such as, the red fox, hedgehog and badger, are very common, whereas others, like the Irish hare, red deer and pine marten are less so. Aquatic wildlife, such as species of sea turtle, shark, seal, whale, and dolphin, are common off the coast. About 400 species of birds have been recorded in Ireland. Many of these are migratory, including the <b>barn</b> <b>swallow.</b>|$|E
5|$|The genus Ptyonoprogne {{is closely}} related to the larger swallow genus Hirundo, and is {{sometimes}} included within it since the nests of the Ptyonoprogne crag martins resemble those of typical Hirundo species like the <b>barn</b> <b>swallow.</b> However, a DNA analysis showed that if Hirundo is enlarged to contain the crag martins, it should include all the mud-builder genera. Conversely, if the Delichon house martins are considered to be a separate genus, as is normally the case, Cecropis, Petrochelidon and Ptyonoprogne should also be split off. The pale crag martin's nearest relatives are {{the other members of the}} genus, the dusky crag martin P. concolor of southern Asia, the rock martin P. fuligula of Southern Africa, and the Eurasian crag martin P. rupestris.|$|E
5|$|Martin pairs often nest alone, {{although}} where suitable {{sites are}} available small loose colonies may form. These {{are more common}} south of the Sahara, where up to 40 rock martin pairs together have been recorded. Crag martins aggressively defend their nesting territory against conspecifics and other species. The nest, built by both adults over several weeks, is made from several hundred mud pellets and lined with soft dry grass or sometimes feathers. It may be a half-cup when constructed under an overhang on a vertical wall or cliff, or shaped as a bowl {{like that of the}} <b>barn</b> <b>swallow</b> when placed on a sheltered ledge. The nest may be built on a rock cliff face, in a crevice or on a man-made structure, and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years. Usually two broods are raised, and the rock martin may nest for a third time in a season.|$|E

50|$|In North America at least, <b>barn</b> <b>swallows</b> {{frequently}} {{engage in}} a mutualist relationship with ospreys. <b>Barn</b> <b>swallows</b> will build their nest below an osprey nest, receiving protection from other birds of prey that are repelled by the exclusively fish-eating ospreys. The ospreys are alerted {{to the presence of}} these predators by the alarm calls of the swallows.|$|R

5|$|The Delichon species {{typically}} feed {{higher in}} the air, and take smaller prey than other swallows. It is believed that this reduces inter-specific food competition, particularly with the <b>barn</b> <b>swallow</b> which shares much of the breeding and wintering range of the martins. The insects eaten are mostly small flies, aphids and Hymenoptera such as winged ants. A wide range of other insects are caught, including Lepidoptera, beetles and lacewings. The Asian house martin appears to occasionally take terrestrial springtails and larvae and the common house martin also sometimes feeds on the ground. These martins are gregarious, feeding in flocks often with other aerial predators like swifts, or other hirundines such as the barn or striated swallows. In the case of at least the common house martin, the start of egg laying appears {{to be linked to}} the appearance of large numbers of flying aphids, which provide a stable and abundant food supply.|$|E
5|$|The nest, {{built by}} both adults over several weeks, {{is made from}} several hundred mud pellets and lined with {{feathers}} and soft, dry grass, hair, sheep’s wool or plant down. It may be a half-cup when constructed under an overhang on a vertical wall or cliff, or shaped as a bowl {{like that of the}} <b>barn</b> <b>swallow</b> when placed on a sheltered ledge. The nest may be built on a rock cliff face, in a crevice or on a man-made structure, and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years. Caves are found in limestone formations and in the lava flows which cover much of western Saudi Arabia, and their ceilings are a favoured location for nesting pale crag martins, red-rumped swallows, and the little swifts which may appropriate the hirundines' nests. In buildings, nests are usually constructed against concrete, which provides adhesion similar to that of rock, but metal walls are sometimes used, and nests may be supported on beams or other horizontal supports. Birds sometimes breed in occupied buildings, and there is a record of a pair nesting in a busy restaurant kitchen. Artificial nests are readily used, and halved coconut shells have been successfully occupied in Abu Dhabi.|$|E

40|$|Adult <b>Barn</b> <b>Swallows</b> Hirundo rustica exhibit strong sexual size {{dimorphism}} in {{the length}} of the outermost tail feathers, which are longer in males compared with females. This trait is traditionally used to sex adult <b>Barn</b> <b>Swallows</b> in the field. However, due to the wear and breakage of the tips of the outer tail feather and tail moult during the non-breeding season, sexing becomes unreliable or even impossible. We therefore tested whether {{the length of}} the white spot on the outer tail feather is sexually dimorphic, and whether it can be used as an additional sexing method for adult <b>Barn</b> <b>Swallows.</b> The white spot length was sexually dimorphic, based on DNA analysis of 101 adult individuals caught at their roost during the non-breeding season in Zambia. Accuracy in sex determination of 95 % could be obtained by classifying individuals with a white spot length 29. 5 mm as males. When applying {{the length of the}} white spot as an additional method to sex adult <b>Barn</b> <b>Swallows</b> on all birds caught in Zambia during the study period (N = 759), the percentage of birds that could successfully be sexed increased to more than 55 %. Therefore we emphasise the importance of measuring the white spot length in addition to the tail fork depth and tail length to sex adult <b>Barn</b> <b>Swallows</b> in the non-breeding season. ...|$|R

25|$|Swallows are tolerated {{by humans}} {{because of their}} {{beneficial}} role as insect-eaters, and some species have readily adapted to nesting in and around human habitation. The <b>barn</b> <b>swallow</b> and house martin now rarely use natural sites. The purple martin is also actively encouraged by people to nest around humans and elaborate nest boxes are erected. Enough artificial nesting sites have been created that the purple martin now seldom nests in natural cavities {{in the eastern part}} of its range.|$|E

40|$|Palearctic migrants, {{including}} <b>barn</b> <b>swallows</b> Hirundo rustica, {{responded to}} climate change in Europe from {{the mid to late}} 1900 s with phenological changes, mostly showing earlier arrival and start of breeding. During this period, <b>barn</b> <b>swallows</b> in the Palearctic exhibited variable patterns of change in the timing of their arrival, breeding and departure from the breeding grounds. At the South African non-breeding grounds, the timing of migration shifted between the 1980 s and 2000 s, again with geographic variability. To explain these changes further, I examined geographic and temporal variability in the timing of flight feather ('primary') moult, and trends in body weight, in <b>barn</b> <b>swallows</b> ringed in South Africa between 1986 and 2012. Citizen science bird ringing, started in South Africa in 1948, generated all the data used in this project. All data were obtained from the South African Bird Ringing Unit (SAFRING) ...|$|R
25|$|Highly {{adapted to}} aerial feeding, {{they have a}} {{distinctive}} appearance. The term Swallow is used colloquially in Europe as a synonym for the <b>barn</b> <b>swallow.</b> There are around 83 species in 19 genera, with the greatest diversity found in Africa, which is also thought to be where they evolved as hole-nesters. They also occur {{on a number of}} oceanic islands. A number of European and North American species are long-distance migrants; by contrast, the West and South African swallows are non-migratory.|$|E
25|$|The {{swallows}} and martins have {{a worldwide}} cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. One species, the Pacific swallow, occurs as a breeding bird {{on a number of}} oceanic islands in the Pacific Ocean, the Mascarene martin breeds on Reunion and Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, and a number of migratory species are common vagrants to other isolated islands and even to some sub-Antarctic islands and Antarctica. Many species have enormous worldwide ranges, particularly the <b>barn</b> <b>swallow,</b> which breeds over most of the Northern Hemisphere and winters over most of the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|The colours and {{distributions}} of retinal oil droplets vary considerably among species, {{and is more}} dependent on the ecological niche utilised (hunter, fisher, herbivore) than genetic relationships. As examples, diurnal hunters like the <b>barn</b> <b>swallow</b> and birds of prey have few coloured droplets, whereas the surface fishing common tern has {{a large number of}} red and yellow droplets in the dorsal retina. The evidence suggests that oil droplets respond to natural selection faster than the cone's visual pigments. Even within the range of wavelengths that are visible to humans, passerine birds can detect colour differences that humans do not register. This finer discrimination, together with the ability to see ultraviolet light, means that many species show sexual dichromatism that is visible to birds but not humans.|$|E

25|$|The Salmon Falls Creek {{watershed}} {{varies widely}} {{in terms of}} different habitats. Along the lower section of the creek, plentiful water flow and numerous springs create a rich riparian environment compared to an oasis, lined with coyote willow, dogwood, golden currant, cattail, mint and poison ivy. The upper section is a slow-moving waterway that supports a small wetland and extensive meadows. In contrast, {{the vast majority of}} the upper undeveloped watershed is a shrub-steppe sagebrush grassland, much of which is used for grazing. Many bird species use the Salmon Falls Creek canyon, including white-throated swift, canyon and rock wrens, cliff swallow, violet-green swallow, <b>barn</b> <b>swallow,</b> screech owl, long-eared owl, great horned owl, kestrel, red-tailed hawk, golden eagles and prairie falcon. Mule deer also inhabit areas of the middle and upper Salmon Falls Creek basin.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the long}} human {{experience}} with these conspicuous species, many myths and legends have arisen as a consequence, particularly relating to the <b>barn</b> <b>swallow.</b> The Roman historian Pliny the Elder described a use of painted swallows to deliver {{a report of the}} winning horses at a race. During the nineteenth century, Jean Desbouvrie attempted to tame swallows and train them for use as messenger birds, as an alternative to war pigeons. He succeeded in curbing the migratory instinct in young birds and persuaded the government of France to conduct initial testing, but further experimentation stalled. Subsequent attempts to train homing behaviour into swallows and other passerines had difficulty establishing a statistically significant success rate, although the birds have been known to trap themselves repeatedly in order to obtain bait from traps.|$|E
