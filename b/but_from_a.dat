5|$|Introduced to hockey {{by family}} friends, Bégin began playing at age six {{and was an}} offensively minded player in his minor hockey years.

5|$|As Lennon hated doing {{a second}} take to double his vocals, Ken Townsend, the studio's {{technical}} manager, developed an alternative form of double-tracking called artificial double tracking (ADT) system, taking the {{signal from the}} sync head of one tape machine and delaying it slightly through a second tape machine. The two tape machines used were not driven by mains electricity, <b>but</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> separate generator which put out a particular frequency, the same for both, thereby keeping them locked together. By altering the speed and frequencies, he could create various effects, which the Beatles used throughout the recording of Revolver. Lennon's vocal is double-tracked on the first three verses of the song: {{the effect of the}} Leslie cabinet can be heard after the (backwards) guitar solo.|$|E
5|$|James Campbell refutes {{suggestions}} that the hides given for each tribe were {{the sum of}} a system of locally-collected assessments and argues that a two-tier system of assessment, one for large areas such as kingdoms and a more accurate one for individual estates, may have existed. He considers the possibility that many of the tribes named in the Tribal Hidage were no more than administrative units and that some names did not originate from a tribe itself <b>but</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> place from where the people were governed, eventually coming to signify the district where the tribe itself lived. Barbara Yorke suggests that the -sætan/sæte form of several of the place-names are an indication that they were named after a feature of the local landscape. She also suggests the tribes were dependent administrative units and not independent kingdoms, some of which were created as such after the main kingdoms were stabilized.|$|E

5|$|The Second Battle of Copenhagen (or the Bombardment of Copenhagen) (16 August – 5 September 1807) {{was from}} a British point of view a {{preemptive}} attack on Copenhagen, targeting the civilian population in order to seize the Dano-Norwegian fleet. <b>But</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Danish point of view the battle was a terror bombardment on their capital. Particularly notable {{was the use of}} incendiary Congreve rockets (containing phosphorus, which cannot be extinguished with water) that randomly hit the city. Few houses with straw roofs remained after the bombardment. The largest church, Vor frue kirke, was destroyed by the sea artillery. Several historians consider this battle the first terror attack against a major European city in modern times.|$|E

25|$|Coriander {{potentially}} may {{be confused}} with culantro (Eryngium foetidum L.), an Apiaceae like coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.), <b>but</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> different genus. Culantro has a distinctly different spiny appearance, a more potent volatile leaf oil and a stronger aroma.|$|E
25|$|These standings do not {{necessarily}} reflect a skater/couple's capabilities. Due to limits on entries to events (no more than three from each country), and varying numbers of high-level skaters in each country, skaters from some countries may find it more difficult to qualify to compete at major events. Thus, a skater with a lower SB <b>but</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> country with few high-level skaters may qualify to a major event while a skater with a much higher SB <b>but</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> country with more than three high-level skaters may not be sent. As a result, it is possible for a skater who regularly scores higher to end up with a much lower world standing.|$|E

25|$|The {{biggest threat}} {{to the lives of}} the tsar and his family, however, came not from terrorists, <b>but</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{derailment}} of the imperial train in the fall of 1888. Maria and her family had been at lunch in the dining car when the train jumped the tracks and slid down an embankment, causing the roof of the dining car to nearly cave in on them.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the same}} time, Prime Minister Ben Chifley pledged that his {{government}} would aim to introduce television {{to the country}} as soon as possible.

25|$|Finally, {{the heat}} for fusion {{ignition}} {{comes not from}} the primary <b>but</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> second fission bomb called the spark plug, embedded {{in the heart of}} the secondary. The implosion of the secondary implodes this spark plug, detonating it and igniting fusion in the material around it, but the spark plug then continues to fission in the neutron-rich environment until it is fully consumed, adding significantly to the yield.|$|E

25|$|Crysis is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} by Crytek {{and published by}} Electronic Arts for Microsoft Windows and released in November 2007. It is the first game in the Crysis series. A separate game entitled Crysis Warhead was released on September 16, 2008, and follows similar events as Crysis <b>but</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> different narrative perspective. At the time Crysis was released, and years thereafter, it has been praised for its milestones in graphical design (commensurate with high hardware requirements).|$|E
25|$|These {{were the}} great years for Andrews. He played 142 matches for Somerset in these 5 seasons {{out of the}} 144 that Somerset played. He missed just 2 matches through injury in July 1939. This ended a run of 127 {{consecutive}} games for the county, a Somerset record at the time. This {{is in many ways}} impressive <b>but</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> negative point of view it does also indicate that he was never selected to play for England nor was he ever chosen for other important matches like Gentlemen v Players.|$|E
25|$|Peter Schäfer {{states that}} there can be no doubt that the {{narrative}} of the execution of Jesus in the Talmud refers to Jesus of Nazareth, but states that the rabbinic literature in question are not Tannaitic <b>but</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> later Amoraic period and may have drawn on the Christian gospels, and may have been written as responses to them. Bart Ehrman and separately Mark Allan Powell state that given that the Talmud references are quite late, they can give no historically reliable information about the teachings or actions of Jesus during his life.|$|E

50|$|The star (or mullet) is {{comparatively}} rare {{in medieval}} heraldry, <b>but</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> early time, the five-pointed star was preferred in English and Scottish heraldry (e.g. in the Dering Roll, c. 1270), while the preferred {{number of points}} in German heraldry was six.|$|R

25|$|Socrates {{responds}} to the death-penalty verdict by first addressing the jurors who voted for his death. He says that their condemnation of him resulted not {{from a lack of}} arguments, <b>but</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> lack of time — and an unwillingness to pander for pity, as expected of a man condemned to death. Socrates repeats that the prospect of death does not absolve him from following the path of goodness and truth. He prophesies that younger and harsher critics shall follow in his stead, philosophers who will spur ethical conduct from the citizens of Athens, in a manner more vexing than that of Socrates (39d).|$|E
25|$|The {{clinical}} study Human Sexual Response {{was published by}} Masters and Johnson in 1966, and the topic suddenly became more commonplace in America. The 1969 book Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask) by psychiatrist David Reuben was a more popular attempt at answering the public's curiosity regarding such matters. Then in 1972 appeared The Joy of Sex by Alex Comfort, reflecting an even more candid perception of love-making. By this time, the recreational or 'fun' aspects of sexual behavior were being discussed more openly than ever before, and this more 'enlightened' outlook resulted {{not just from the}} publication of such new books as these, <b>but</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> more pervasive sexual revolution that had already been well underway for some time.|$|E
25|$|Synoeca septentrionalis {{is one of}} five {{species of}} wasp in the genus of Synoeca, with the other four being S. chalybea, S. cyanea, S. surinama, and S. virginea. Wasps in the Synoeca genus are often {{referred}} to as warrior wasps and are found in various areas in the Americas. Each wasp in the genus exhibits similar characteristics, <b>but</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> phylogenetic standpoint, S. septentrionalis is most closely related to S. surinama and S. cyanea. The wasps in this genus are also a part of the paper wasp tribe known as Epiponini, which are considered to be Neotropical. In general, the genus is quite aggressive and will often display cohesive defense mechanisms when threatened.|$|E
