Two <b>boats,</b> the <b>seine</b> <b>boat</b> and the so-called “follower” were used. The <b>seine</b> <b>boat,</b> a large boat pulled by perhaps a dozen or more oars, carried the net, which was often 300-400 yards long. An experienced fisherman acted as a “huer” by directing fishing operations from suitable points of vantage. From high land, the huer could see the shoals of pilchards clearly, and he directed the “skipper” of the <b>seine</b> <b>boat,</b> by suitable signs to the location of a likely shoal. On a given signal, the net was shot around the shoal by the <b>seine</b> <b>boat,</b> and in the meantime, the free end of the net was picked up by the “follower”, with a crew of perhaps five or six, and the two ends of the net were brought together. Weighted pieces of timber were placed to prevent the fish from escaping. The escaping footropes of the net were gradually drawn up until the fish were completely enclosed, and by means of baskets the fish were transferred from the net to the boat, and fishing continued until no more fish could be managed, or if catches were poor.
