500|$|Soon after [...] "Querido FBI" [...] gained notoriety for Calle 13, the band's 2005 eponymously titled {{debut album}} was {{released}} and became commercially and critically successful in Latin America. [...] The group was subsequently labeled as reggaeton, a genre that the duo wished to distance itself from. [...] Visitante {{commented on the}} situation: [...] "The {{truth is that the}} first record had only four reggaetons. Those were the cuts used for promotional purposes, and so that’s the brand that was put on us. But from the beginning, to me, reggaeton never offered anything musically. My brother liked it, yes, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>always</b> tried to execute it in an organic way, with real instruments and mixing it with other genres." ...|$|E

In October 2016, Feige {{said it was}} a combination of knowing what films would occupy these dates and allowing some flexibility, saying, [...] "We know what [...] we’d like them to be for 2020. Over the years, where we’re aiming we’ve been lucky enough that it’s usually been the same thing <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>always</b> leave ourselves the opportunity to bob and weave and adapt if we have to. But we know where we’re headed for 2020 and we have ideas and we're beginning to solidify the years beyond that." [...] Feige and Marvel have ideas for films through 2021, and additional storylines planned through 2028.|$|E

Antonio played college basketball with the Memphis Tigers under head coach John Calipari and was most notably named Conference USA Defensive Player of the Year in 2009. He has experience playing professional basketball in the NBA Development League and outside North America. He also played alongside Anthony with the Saint John Mill Rats in 2012. The National Basketball Association (NBA) team, the Oklahoma City Thunder, signed him to multiple 10-day contracts in February 2010. The two brothers' uncle, Marvin Avery, said, [...] "There's some in our family {{that have been in}} trouble, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>always</b> had Antonio and his brother [...] playing basketball or traveling somewhere to play basketball at all times." [...] When Anthony began playing at UMass, his younger brother became frustrated with basketball and wanted to play American football instead. However, Anthony and his uncles convinced him to continue playing basketball.|$|E

2500|$|The Boy Scout Council {{wanted to}} fill the dam in time for their short, three-week summer camping season. When Fish and Game would not make an exception, the Council {{contacted}} California State Senator Bruce McPherson, Vice-Chairman of the California State Senate Environmental Quality Committee, who called the head of Fish and Game, Robert Hight. Hight, now a judge, commented, [...] "We received political pressure from legislators all the time, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>always</b> did the right thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The ballet {{is under}} the {{direction}} of Lev Nikolaevich Kulikov National Artist of Russia, the main ballet master, [...] and maintains the heights of choreographic art with honour. The priority in its repertoire is taken by the military compositions: Matroskaya barynya, Kazachiya cavalry plyaska, Festive march, Invitation to dance and others. The ballet performs a lot of Russian folk dances. The classical repertoire contains Poloveckie plyasky from the opera Prince Igor written by Alexander Borodin. This is from our dance classics, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>always</b> update the dance repertoire.

2500|$|Leahy {{is a fan}} of the Grateful Dead. He has {{not only}} {{attended}} concerts, but has a collection of the band's tapes in his Senate Offices. Jerry Garcia visited him at his Senate offices, and Leahy gave a tie designed by Garcia to Senator Orrin Hatch (who responded by giving Leahy a Rush Limbaugh tie). Surviving band members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart have participated in fundraisers for Leahy and his Political Action Committee, the Green Mountain Victory Fund. Leahy appeared in a videotaped tribute to the Dead when they received a lifetime achievement award at the 2002 Jammys. His Senate website notes this response to a question from seventh grade students from Vermont's Thetford Academy who asked Leahy which Dead song was his favorite, he replied: [...] "... my favorite is [...] "Black Muddy River" [...] <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>always</b> play [...] "Truckin'" [...] on election night at my headquarters." ...|$|E

2500|$|Carl Doran, the {{creative}} {{head of the}} Torch coverage across the BBC, revealed in a blog on BBC Online, that the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) and EastEnders production team had worked for two years to organise the flame being shown live on EastEnders, saying [...] "We've been looking into the practicalities and many challenges of getting the torch to Walford in time for an EastEnders slot while it makes a whistle-stop tour through London's 32 boroughs in the final week of the 70-day journey around the UK. We also discussed the idea of trying to record it on tape like a traditional EastEnders episode as well, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>always</b> {{wanted it to be}} as authentic as possible and so it will be the real torch and flame and it will happen live. It's very exciting, and even more so because live broadcasting adds an extra set of challenges to a top drama." ...|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the course}} of the early 2010s, the group began moving away from {{standard}} band instrumentation and began incorporating more elements of electronic dance music. In an interview with EDM Sauce, they talk about their transition being facilitated by frequent production and remixing on the side. Cash Cash stated, [...] "I think for us it was a slow evolution, because we were always remixing and producing for other artists and doing outside production." [...] In another interview with Only The Beat, the group stated, [...] "When we first started as a band our sound was [...] "poppy", <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>always</b> had underlying electronic elements to our music. Once we started changing and growing, our sound slowly began evolving." [...] The group's 2011 album Love or Lust was described by Under the Gun Review as [...] "dance/power pop...full of bass rhythms, synthetic claps, techno beats, and dance/party/club themes". Following releases and remixes were also received as electronica and electropop.|$|E
2500|$|As {{former member}} and founder Bullington puts it [...] "we {{can play an}} old folks home in the {{afternoon}} and then play for a bunch of punk rockers, or whoever else might still be up and ready for a good time, or some music at midnight. They all seem to enjoy it equally." [...] Fellow founder Sickmen claims [...] "the original intent of the band [...] [...] was to bring old-time Appalachian country punk rock." [...] Band member Jesse [...] "Baby J." [...] Fiske questions the importance of assigning a specific style: [...] "We're not really an old-time band either. As long as we speak to someone, it doesn't really matter what the genre is." [...] The group largely performs original material, with a traditional feel. [...] As former member Shawn Galbraith, banjo player, puts it: [...] "We play original material provided by different members of the band. There are some traditional elements to our sound for sure, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>always</b> try to maintain some uniqueness." [...] "I don't think many people would call us a traditional oldtime band," [...] states bandleader David Sickmen: [...] "I'd say our songs are about ninety percent originals. Then we have some old-time songs we play in our own way." ...|$|E
