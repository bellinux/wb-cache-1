5|$|In 1969, Wilder {{relocated}} to Paris, accepting {{a leading role}} in Bud Yorkin's Start the Revolution Without Me, a comedy that took place during the French Revolution. After shooting ended, Wilder returned to New York, where he read the script for Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx and immediately called Sidney Glazier, who produced The Producers. Both men began searching for the perfect director for the film. Jean Renoir was the first candidate, but he would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> film for at least a year, so British-Indian director Waris Hussein was hired. With Margot Kidder co-starring with Wilder, it was filmed on location in Dublin, and at the nearby Ardmore Studios, in August and September 1969.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, luminiferous aether, aether, or ether, meaning light-bearing aether, was the {{postulated}} medium for {{the propagation of}} light. It was invoked to explain {{the ability of the}} apparently wave-based light to propagate through empty space, something that waves should not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>The</b> assumption of a spatial plenum of luminiferous aether, rather than a spatial vacuum, provided the theoretical medium that was required by wave theories of light.|$|E

And they must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it well.

25|$|In {{computer}} programming, BASIC is {{a family}} of high-level programming languages. The original BASIC was invented in 1963 by John George Kemeny and Thomas Eugene Kurtz at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire to provide computer access to non-science students. At the time, nearly all use of computers required writing custom software, which was something only scientists and mathematicians tended to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>The</b> language and its variants became widespread on microcomputers in the late 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Facial {{expressions}} {{can provide}} rapid {{feedback on the}} progress of a dialog between two humans, and soon may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same for humans and robots. Robotic faces have been constructed by Hanson Robotics using their elastic polymer called Frubber, allowing a large number of facial expressions due to the elasticity of the rubber facial coating and embedded subsurface motors (servos). The coating and servos are built on a metal skull. A robot should know how to approach a human, judging by their facial expression and body language. Whether the person is happy, frightened, or crazy-looking affects the type of interaction expected of the robot. Likewise, robots like Kismet and the more recent addition, Nexi can produce a range of facial expressions, allowing it to have meaningful social exchanges with humans.|$|E
25|$|Their concept artists {{looked to}} the team's {{favorite}} graphic novels for inspiration and the concept artwork by Ralph McQuarrie, Doug Chiang, Joe Johnston, and others {{who worked on the}} Star Wars films. They were given access to the Episode II script and concept art early on before the film came out. LucasArts created storyboarded scripts of their cutscenes and gave them to ILM, who developed them into cinematic cutscenes. Knoles envisioned the level layouts and then consulted with lead level designer David Wehr and his level designers. They created a bubble map of the levels which they worked from to determine details in what the player would face and <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>The</b> team made a new engine for the game {{to be able to do}} what they wanted. The graphic designers worked concurrently with the level designers to create the environments, which the level designers then used to better visualize what they were trying to do. Knoles had previously been involved in the development of the Super Star Wars trilogy for the Super Nintendo and often referred to those games when describing certain aspects of Star Wars: Bounty Hunter to the team.|$|E

The tension was renewed in May 2014 when, {{in a speech to the}} Tanzanian National Assembly, Foreign Affairs Minister Bernard Membe renewed his claim that Rwandans were causing instability in the DRC.

A premium DLC pack titled Rise of the Cakeling was released shortly after and added new story levels and tools for creators enabling them to create PlayStation Move games.|$|E
2500|$|After the Mexican-American War, Henry Wayne befriended George H. Crosman. Crossman {{brought up}} {{his idea of}} using camels for {{transportation}} of people and supplies in the newly conquered American Southwest. Wayne relayed this idea to Senator Jefferson Davis; and when Davis became Secretary of War on 1853, he urged Congress {{to pass a bill}} to experiment with the camels. Wayne was chosen to lead an expedition to the Middle East to purchase $30,000 worth of camels. The group sailed to London on the USS Supply to examine camels in zoos. They then journeyed to Italy and met Grand Duke Leopold II to see his 250 camels that were said to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> work of 1000 horses. They then purchased thirty-three camels: three in Tunisia, nine in Egypt, and twenty-one in Turkey. When the group arrived back, they experimented with the animals in the deserts of the western United States. Forty-one more camels would arrive later to join the corps. Congress, on the request of the Department of War, proposed a bill to buy 1,000 more camels, but the start of the Civil War quickly ended the debate [...] The experiments were also ended with the start of the Civil War, and the remaining camels were either sold or released into the wild.|$|E
2500|$|Brigham Young {{taught that}} if women [...] "should {{stand behind the}} counter, study law or physic , or become good book-keepers and <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> {{business}} in any counting house, and this to enlarge their sphere of usefulness {{for the benefit of}} society at large." [...] Many women in Brigham Young's time worked; in 1874, Utah had a respectable class of literate and professional women and a visitor noted that no profession was closed to women. After the church officially ended polygamy, church members adopted a more mainstream Victorian view towards women's work, which confined women's roles to the home. By 1920, the church's ideals for women mirrored society's until the 1960s and 70s, when some Church leaders strongly advised against (presumably married) women working outside the home. Spencer W. Kimball said, [...] "Numerous divorces can be traced directly to the day when the wife left the home and went out into the world into employment." [...] Gordon B. Hinckley made allowances for single mothers and other women in similar circumstances: [...] "I recognize [...] that there are some women (it has become very many, in fact) who have to work to provide for the needs of their families. To you I say, do the very best you can." [...] A 1986 Ensign article emphasized that husband and wife share the responsibility of providing for their children's temporal needs, and that each family would prayerfully decide if a mother would go to work. Mormon women were to reject the secular values of individuality and devote themselves to the eternal women's roles of marriage, motherhood, and submissiveness.|$|E

2500|$|On 6 September 2010, Body Talk Pt. 2 was {{released}} in the UK. It was preceded by the lead single, a dance version of [...] "Hang with Me" [...] from Body Talk Pt. 1, on 5 September. The album includes a duet with American rapper Snoop Dogg, [...] "U Should Know Better". Robyn performed [...] "Dancing on My Own" [...] with deadmau5 at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on 12 September. In a BBC Newsbeat interview, Robyn explained her decision to release three albums in one year: [...] "It was just something I felt like I needed to do.

Robyn announced the release of the single, [...] "Indestructible", on 13 October 2010; an acoustic version appeared on Body Talk Pt. 2. The song {{was released}} on 17 November in Scandinavia and 22 November in the UK. Co-written by Klas Åhlund, it was described as a [...] "pulsating full power version [...] takes every ounce of that emotion and wraps it up in another exceptional disco-pop record worthy of any dance-floor or passion-laden sing-a-long." [...] Robyn planned to collaborate with Swedish producer Max Martin on the song, [...] "Time Machine"; Martin produced Robyn's US singles [...] "Do You Know (What It Takes)" [...] and [...] "Show Me Love", both of which peaked in the top 10 on the Billboard 100 in 1997.

2500|$|The lead single, had an on air, on sale release, Roberts {{stated that}} Universal Records wanted {{to release the}} track that way, {{as it was the}} way they were {{releasing}} all of their new work. The release of this nature, was due to illegal downloading, and the record label was attempting to avoid illegal downloads as much as possible as Roberts stated, [...] "it's now harder for artists". Talking of Girls Aloud, Roberts stated she was used to releasing a song after around six weeks of promotion, including radio, television and press promotion, and commented that it was [...] "very scary" [...] to release a song without this publicity. She also noted the effect of this kind of release against chart positions, she said, [...] "I think it's harder for the public now because it's always been about the chart position. I also think it takes the excitement out of the charts because it's not a competition anymore." [...] The album artwork and track-listing were confirmed on 22 August 2011 on Roberts official website, the announcement came with confirmation that fans who pre-ordered the album on Play.com would receive a signed poster, and those who pre-ordered the song from digital store iTunes would have an exclusive highlight video montage of her webisode series Through Nicola's Eyes. Roberts performed at G-A-Y, after rehearsing the entire day prior to the event during which time she changed her set-list around, performing the track [...] "Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime" [...] with a drum and bass edit, in addition to performing a remix of her single [...] "Lucky Day". For the performance Roberts wore five-foot hair extensions that touched the ground, which proved restricting for her movements, in addition to wearing shorts with [...] "big pompoms on the back". Writing as a guest blogger for site Holy Moly, Roberts discussed the event saying [...] "the crowd was incredible.
