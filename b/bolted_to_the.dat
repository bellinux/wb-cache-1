5|$|On September 10, 2015, Miyamoto {{confirmed}} a fan theory {{stating that}} the entirety of Super Mario Bros. 3 takes place as a stage play. The game opens with curtains being pulled, featuring obstacles hanging from the catwalk, objects <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> background, and shadows on the skyline. When Mario finishes a level, he walks off the stage.|$|E
5|$|Each engine main {{combustion}} chamber (MCC) receives fuel-rich hot gas from a hot-gas manifold cooling circuit. The gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen enter the chamber at the injector, which mixes the propellants. A small augmented-spark igniter-chamber {{is located in}} the center of the injector, and this dual-redundant igniter is used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion. The igniters are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is self-sustaining. The main injector and dome assembly are welded to the hot-gas manifold, and the MCC is also <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hot-gas manifold. The MCC comprises a structural shell made of Inconel 718 which is lined with a copper-silver-zirconium alloy called NARloy-Z, developed specifically for the RS-25 in the 1970s. Around 390 channels are machined into the liner wall to carry liquid hydrogen through the liner to provide MCC cooling, as the temperature in the {{combustion chamber}} reaches 3300°C (6000°F) during flight – higher than the boiling point of iron.|$|E
5|$|The skins of the fuselage, {{wings and}} {{tailplane}} were secured by rivets, and in critical {{areas such as}} the wing forward of the main spar where an uninterrupted airflow was required, with flush rivets; the fuselage used standard dome-headed riveting. From February 1943 flush riveting was used on the fuselage, affecting all Spitfire variants. In some areas, such as {{at the rear of the}} wing, and the lower tailplane skins, the top was riveted and the bottom fixed by brass screws which tapped into strips of spruce <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower ribs. The removable wing tips were made up of duralumin-skinned spruce formers. At first the ailerons, elevators and rudder were fabric-covered. When combat experience showed that fabric-covered ailerons were impossible to use at high speeds, a light alloy replaced the fabric, enhancing control throughout the speed range.|$|E
30|$|Manipulation of the {{electric}} field {{has been used to}} create interesting scaffold geometries (Wang et al. 2009). In this study, {{the electric}} field was manipulated by attaching two stainless steel <b>bolts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> collection plate. Fibers aligned themselves between the two bolts and radially from <b>the</b> <b>bolts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> collection plate. This method creates aligned nanofibers without the use of a rotating mandrel, which promotes an increase in scaffold porosity.|$|R
25|$|The {{design of}} the {{rotating}} bolt handle, which served <b>to</b> lock <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> receiver in the forward position.|$|R
50|$|The chassis of the skate, called <b>the</b> frame, <b>bolts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{bottom of}} the skate. Skaters grind on the frames, which are {{designed}} for this purpose.|$|R
25|$|A {{side arm}} is a metal pole <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{instrument}} with a clamp on the end. This enables the instrument to be hung {{to the side}} of an electric as opposed to below it.|$|E
25|$|Share, landside, {{mouldboard}} are <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> frog {{which is}} an irregular piece of cast iron. The base of a plough body is called the frog and the soil wearing parts are bolted to it.|$|E
25|$|The {{walls of}} the trunk were either <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> piston or cast as one piece with it, and moved {{back and forth with}} it. The working portion of the {{cylinder}} is annular or ring-shaped, with the trunk passing through the centre of the cylinder itself.|$|E
50|$|The bolt {{release lever}} {{is located on}} the right side of the action (on {{right-handed}} models) behind the ejection port. Pressing this lever down while pulling <b>the</b> unlocked <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear allows <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> be removed from the rifle for cleaning.|$|R
50|$|The Hillberg Carbine {{was a light}} rifle {{concept for}} the US armed forces during WW2. It {{featured}} a gas-operated operation that moved the barrel forward rather than <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear. The layout of the rifle was later used in the Whitney Wolverine pistol.|$|R
50|$|In North America the NV3550 {{is used by}} Jeep {{with the}} 4.0L inline 6. It looks similar to and could be mistaken for the Dodge NV3500. However the Jeep NV3550 {{bellhousing}} <b>bolts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> transmission case.|$|R
25|$|The four-speed gearbox was not <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> engine, {{but was a}} {{separate}} shaft-driven unit mounted between {{the second and third}} crossmembers. While the remote gearbox placement led to a complicated linkage to the column-mounted shifter, resulting in vague shifter action, it also improved legroom for the front passengers.|$|E
25|$|The {{body was}} {{constructed}} of a dual H-frame platform chassis and aircraft-style tube framework, {{and a very}} thin steel shell that was <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chassis. Because the original design brief called for a low speed car, little or no {{attention was paid to}} aerodynamics; the body had a , high by today's standards but typical for the era.|$|E
25|$|Of this work, {{the major}} item was the {{modification}} of the wheels. The solution adopted by the National Railway Museum Workshop was to employ a metal fabricator to cut four rings from 40-mm-thick steel plate. These were cut with enough precision not to need any further machining. The rings were then <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> existing wheels and were a complete success.|$|E
50|$|On September 30, 2015 Sean Anthony {{was traded}} by <b>the</b> Meralco <b>Bolts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mahindra Enforcer for 2016 & 2017 2nd round picks {{and then he}} traded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> NLEX Road Warriors for Juneric Baloria & 2016 2nd round pick.|$|R
50|$|On 10 April 1929 Prince Alfred Hamlet got its own train station. The Minister of Railways, W.C. Malan, applied <b>the</b> last <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> line {{before the}} train, filled with school children, left Ceres for the {{ceremony}} at Hamlet.|$|R
50|$|On a motorcycle, modern panniers are {{normally}} hard-shell cases mounted behind {{the seat and}} on either-side of the rear wheel, attached to a framework (which <b>bolts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> motorcycle frame) known as a carrier. Modern panniers are made to be quickly-detachable.|$|R
25|$|While {{with the}} Sox, Jackson promised his mother {{that once he}} {{returned}} from his hip replacement surgery he would {{hit a home run}} for her. Before he could return, his mother died. In his first at-bat after surgery, he hit a home run to right field. Jackson had the ball encased in acrylic and <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dresser in her room, according to an interview on ESPN.|$|E
25|$|A {{transfer}} caboose {{looks more}} like a flat car with a shed <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> middle of it than it does a standard caboose. It is used in transfer service between rail yards or short switching runs, and as such, lacks sleeping, cooking or restroom facilities. The ends of a transfer caboose are left open, with safety railings surrounding the area between the crew compartment {{and the end of the}} car.|$|E
25|$|The {{distance}} between the sheets in the spiral channels is maintained by using spacer studs that were welded prior to rolling. Once the main spiral pack has been rolled, alternate top and bottom edges are welded and each end closed by a gasketed flat or conical cover <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> body. This ensures no mixing of the two fluids occurs. Any leakage is from the periphery cover to the atmosphere, or to a passage that contains the same fluid.|$|E
50|$|On August 7, 2015, Cortez and James Sena were traded by Meralco <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Blackwater Elite in {{exchange}} for Larry Rodriguez, who was also traded by <b>the</b> <b>Bolts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters via the Elite {{in exchange}} for Jimmy Alapag.|$|R
50|$|Loading the M240 {{can be done}} {{either with}} <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> forward or <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear. If <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> is <b>to</b> remain forward, <b>the</b> {{operator}} will then load the rounds into the feeding block (feed tray cover closed); or will open the feed tray cover, load the rounds onto the feeding tray, then close the feed tray cover. The charging handle will then be pulled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear, which locks <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear. The weapon is then placed on safe and the charging handle is then placed back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> forward position (this is spring-loaded on the tank-mounted variation). The weapon is now ready for operation.|$|R
25|$|The Jets' first signing was Norm Beaudin ("the Original Jet") and {{the first}} major signing was Bobby Hull. Hull's acquisition, {{partially}} financed {{by the rest of}} the WHA's teams, gave the league instant credibility and paved the way for other NHL stars <b>to</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> upstart league.|$|R
25|$|Bidborough Mill is a four-storey brick tower mill, partly {{rendered}} with cement. It had a Kentish-style cap, four single patent sails and was winded by a fantail. The millstones {{were driven}} underdrift. A large pulley {{on the outside}} of the mill at first-floor level allowed the mill to be driven by belt from a traction engine or tractor, via a gear <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> underside of the Great Spur Wheel. A wheat cleaner and a flour dresser remained in the mill before conversion.|$|E
25|$|Hinged foot irons may be <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{sides of}} the wagon. To lock the wagon in place, the free ends of the foot iron hinges are folded down and then secured to the stage with stage screws. This is a {{reliable}} method for immobilizing wagons, but it creates holes in the stage and can slow the process of locking and unlocking a wagon. Also, if a foot iron is allowed to contact the stage while the wagon is being moved, the stage floor can be damaged.|$|E
25|$|The Oilers {{lost most}} of the players from 1978–79 when the NHL held a {{reclamation}} draft of players who had <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> upstart league as they were allowed to protect two goaltenders and two skill players. Originally, Gretzky was not eligible to be protected; under the rules of the time, he normally would have been placed in the Entry Draft pool. However, Pocklington had signed him to a 21-year personal services contract in 1979 and Pocklington used the contract to force the NHL to admit the Oilers and allow the Oilers to keep Gretzky.|$|E
30|$|In this study, {{the same}} wire was {{measured}} each time, {{but in the}} different models {{the length of the}} wire from <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> acrylic wire would alter the deflection measured. In clinical practice, it may not be possible <b>to</b> absolutely standardise <b>the</b> exact point of measurement on the wire.|$|R
50|$|A {{trailer hitch}} {{typically}} <b>bolts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chassis of the vehicle. In North America {{there are a}} few common classes (I, II, III and IV) that are defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). Some manufacturers market Class V hitches, but there is no such standard according to SAE J684.|$|R
50|$|The bolt {{is locked}} into place by {{a piece of}} {{aluminum}} which swings into place and engages a notch in <b>the</b> barrel extension <b>to</b> lock <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> barrel. This prevents a misfire from dropping as it acts as a crude safety device. Misfires from dropping are common in shotguns such as double-barreled shotguns.|$|R
25|$|The bomb had {{a body of}} {{drawn steel}} to which a heavy pointed nose cone was welded. At the other end was a base plate, just forward of which the {{magnesium}} alloy tail was tack welded onto the body, and also <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tail attachment brace. Around {{the nose of the}} bomb was a kopfring - a metal ring, triangular in cross section, designed to prevent ground penetration or to stop forward momentum when hitting water. The bomb was attached to the aircraft horizontally by a H-type suspension lug.|$|E
25|$|The fence was not {{continuous}} {{and could be}} crossed {{at a number of}} points other than the official border crossings. Gates were installed to enable border guards to patrol up to the border line and to give engineers maintenance access to the outward-facing side of the barrier. Like the fence itself, the gates were designed to be escape-proof. They were hinged from the outside but opened inwards and the pivot pins were welded to prevent their removal. They were chained and locked with heavy-duty padlocks, and a sharp saw-toothed steel strip was <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the gates to prevent them from being climbed.|$|E
25|$|Mole ploughs {{are usually}} trailed and pulled by a crawler tractor, but lighter models {{for use on}} the three-point linkage of {{powerful}} four-wheel drive tractors are also made. A mole plough {{has a very strong}} frame which slides along the ground when the machine is in work. A heavy leg, similar to a subsoiler leg, is attached to the frame and a circular section share with a larger diameter expander on a flexible link is <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> leg. The bullet shaped share forms a tunnel, about 75mm diameter, in the soil and the expander presses the soil outwards to form a long-lasting drainage channel.|$|E
50|$|The {{blowback}} system is practical for firearms using relatively low-power cartridges with lighter weight bullets. Higher power cartridges require heavier <b>bolts</b> <b>to</b> keep <b>the</b> breech from opening prematurely; at some point, the bolt becomes {{too heavy to}} be practical. For an extreme example, a 20mm cannon using simple blowback and lubricated cartridges would need a 500 lb <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> keep <b>the</b> cartridge safely in the barrel {{during the first few}} milliseconds; furthermore, the average force supplied by the return spring is limited to 60 lbf N or the bolt will not travel back far enough to feed a new round. Consequently, the return spring is not powerful enough <b>to</b> keep <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> closed when the gun is tilted up. In addition, there is not enough energy stored in <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> cycle <b>the</b> weapon.|$|R
25|$|The M3's {{cocking handle}} {{assembly}} was {{located on the}} right-hand side of the receiver on the ejector housing, just forward and above the trigger, and consisted of nine parts. As the handle is pulled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear, a pawl rises to engage a notch {{in the bottom of the}} <b>bolt,</b> pushing <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear until it locked back on the sear.|$|R
50|$|The cocking handle, {{also known}} as {{charging}} handle or bolt handle, is a device on a firearm which, when operated, results in the hammer or striker being cocked or moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ready position. It allows <b>the</b> operator <b>to</b> pull <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear. The cocking handle {{has a number of}} functions; it facilitates the ejection of a spent shell casing or unfired cartridge from the chamber; it loads a round from the magazine or by hand through the chamber; it clears a stoppage such as a jam, double feed, stovepipe or misfire; it verifies that the weapon's chamber is clear of any rounds or other obstructions; it moves <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> in <b>to</b> battery, acting as a forward assist (but not necessarily); it releases a <b>bolt</b> locked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear, such as would be the case after firing the last round on a firearm equipped with a last-round-hold-open feature.|$|R
