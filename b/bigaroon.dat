Nicholson, who also owned and trained her during her two-year-old season, had been {{successful}} in National Hunt racing and had trained <b>Bigaroon</b> to win three runnings of the Irish Cesarewitch. Her dam Suspicious Polly was also owned and trained by Nicholson and had some success on the track, winning three minor races in Ireland.|$|E

In Romania similar studies have been made especially at ICDP Pitesti - Maracineni and at SCDP Iasi. In order to obtain new sweet cherry varieties which satisfy the current demands of the consumers and growers, {{in the last five years}} were studied at SCDP Bistrita ten sweet cherry hybrids with early and middle ripening (BN 2 / 224, BN 12 / 12, BN 1 / 1, BN 3 / 112, BN 2 / 66, BN 13 / 6, BN 18 / 24, BN 14 / 83, BN 18 / 6, BN 2 / 158) and four hybrids with late ripening (BN 14 / 148, BN 3 / 5 M 2, BN 14 / 92, BN 3 / 29). All these hybrids showed interest for selection especially in terms of productivity and fruit quality. The study of the biologic material was made according to the usual methodology for field trial. Among the 14 hybrids studied two were distinguished through high quality of fruits, very good yield and good resistance to stress factors and in 2009 they were homologated as Gloria (BN 2 / 158) and Ivona (BN 3 / 29). Gloria (Boambe de Cotnari x Van) has middle ripening, red <b>bigaroon</b> fruits (Van type) with big size (8. 0 g), an average of 18. 2 % dry matter and very high yield (25. 0 kg/tree). Ivona (Hedelfinger x Van) has late ripening, pink <b>bigaroon</b> fruits with middle size (6. 0 g), high yield (22, 0 kg/tree) and an average of 15. 8 % dry matter. Both varieties have good tolerance for Monilinia laxa and for Coccomyces hiemalis...|$|E
