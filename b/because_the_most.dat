5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{circulated}} {{coins in}} the United States {{at the time}} were Spanish currency, Hamilton proposed that minting a United States dollar weighing almost as much as the Spanish peso would be the simplest way to introduce a national currency. Hamilton differed from European monetary policymakers in his desire to overprice gold relative to silver, {{on the grounds that the}} United States would always receive an influx of silver from the West Indies. Despite his own preference for a monometallic gold standard, he ultimately issued a bimetallic currency at a fixed 15:1 ratio of silver to gold.|$|E
5|$|Between 1937 and 1938, Bishop {{studied the}} effects of various factors, {{including}} different substances in blood and different temperatures, on the feeding behaviour of the chicken malaria (Plasmodium gallinaceum) vector, Aedes aegypti. She also examined factors that contributed to Plasmodium reproduction. This work {{became the basis for}} subsequent ongoing research into a malaria vaccine. Her subsequent work was spurred by the outbreak of the Second World War. During the war, she investigated alternative chemotherapies for malaria. Her research aided the British war effort <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> prevalent antimalarial, quinine, was difficult to obtain due to the Japanese occupation of the Dutch West Indies. From 1947 to 1964, she {{was in charge of the}} Institute's Chemotherapy Research Institute, associated with the Medical Research Council.|$|E
5|$|Separation {{procedure}} of einsteinium {{depends on the}} synthesis method. In the case of light-ion bombardment inside a cyclotron, the heavy ion target {{is attached to a}} thin foil, and the generated einsteinium is simply washed off the foil after the irradiation. However, the produced amounts in such experiments are relatively low. The yields are much higher for reactor irradiation, but there, the product is a mixture of various actinide isotopes, as well as lanthanides produced in the nuclear fission decays. In this case, isolation of einsteinium is a tedious procedure which involves several repeating steps of cation exchange, at elevated temperature and pressure, and chromatography. Separation from berkelium is important, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> common einsteinium isotope produced in nuclear reactors, 253Es, decays with a half-life of only 20 days to 249Bk, which is fast on the timescale of most experiments. Such separation relies on the fact that berkelium easily oxidizes to the solid +4 state and precipitates, whereas other actinides, including einsteinium, remain in their +3 state in solutions.|$|E

5|$|The {{breeding}} {{season for the}} Central American squirrel monkey is in September. All females come into estrus at virtually the same time. A month or two before the {{breeding season}} begins, males become larger. This is not due to extra muscle, but to altered water balance within the male's body. This is caused by conversion of the male hormone testosterone into estrogen; thus the more testosterone a male produces, the more he grows {{in advance of the}} breeding season. Since males within a group have not been observed fighting over access to females during breeding season, nor attempting to force females to copulate with them, it is believed that female choice determines which males get to breed with females. Females tend to prefer the males that expand the most in advance of breeding season. This may be <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> enlarged males are generally the oldest and the most effective at detecting predators, or it may be a case of runaway intersexual selection.|$|E

The episode also mocked the measures used to diagnose and treat sexual addiction in the United States. This is particularly prevalent when Kenny, Kyle and Butters are misdiagnosed with sexual addiction based on an inaccurate test of simply presenting an image of a naked woman to them and testing whether they could identify a handkerchief in the woman's hand and specify its color.

500|$|During the mid-twenties Walpole {{produced}} {{two of his}} best-known novels in the macabre vein that he drew on from time to time, exploring the fascination of fear and cruelty. The Old Ladies (1924) is a study of a timid elderly spinster exploited and eventually frightened to death by a predatory widow. Portrait of a Man with Red Hair (1925) depicts the malign influence of a manipulative, insane father on his family and others. Walpole described it to his fellow author Frank Swinnerton as [...] "a simple shocker which it has amused me like anything to write, and won't bore you to read." [...] In contrast he continued a series of stories for children, begun in 1919 with Jeremy, taking the young hero's story forward with Jeremy and Hamlet (the latter being the boy's dog) in 1923, and Jeremy at Crale in 1927. Sadleir, writing in the 1950s, suggests that [...] "the most real Walpole of all– <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> unselfconscious, kindly, and understanding friend– is the Walpole of the Jeremy trilogy." [...] Of his other novels of the 1920s Wintersmoon (1928), his first attempt at a full-length love story, portrays a clash between traditionalism and modernism: his own sympathies, though not spelled out, were clearly with the traditionalists.|$|E

It was subsequently reported that the teams had only been given the option of retaining the elimination format or adopting a hybrid of the elimination and pre-2016 formats, and that an outright reversion to the 2006-2015 format was never discussed. Mercedes' motorsport director Toto Wolff remained adamant that the format needed to be reverted, saying that he did not expect qualifying to be more entertaining than it had been two weeks before. Drivers were equally critical of the retention of the changed format: Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel told the press that he was [...] "as disappointed as probably anyone I know", while Mercedes's Lewis Hamilton called the decision [...] "strange , particularly <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important thing is the fans were unhappy". Another meeting was scheduled for race day to discuss the format, with both Jean Todt, president of the FIA, and Bernie Ecclestone, Formula One's commercial rights holder, in attendance.|$|E
500|$|Experiments {{are being}} {{performed}} on the Avogadro Project's silicon spheres to determine whether their masses are most stable when stored in a vacuum, a partial vacuum, or ambient pressure. However, no technical means currently exist to prove a long-term stability any better {{than that of the}} IPK's <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> sensitive and accurate measurements of mass are made with dual-pan balances like the BIPM's FB2 flexure-strip balance (see External links, below). Balances can only compare the mass of a silicon sphere to that of a reference mass. Given the latest understanding of the lack of long-term mass stability with the IPK and its replicas, there is no known, perfectly stable mass artifact to compare against. Single-pan scales, which measure weight relative to an invariant of nature, are not precise to the necessary long-term uncertainty of [...] parts per billion. Another issue to be overcome is that silicon oxidizes and forms a thin layer (equivalent to [...] silicon atoms) of silicon dioxide (quartz) and silicon monoxide. This layer slightly increases the mass of the sphere, an effect that must be accounted for when polishing the sphere to its finished dimension. Oxidation is not an issue with platinum and iridium, both of which are noble metals that are roughly as cathodic as oxygen and therefore don't oxidize unless coaxed {{to do so in the}} laboratory. The presence of the thin oxide layer on a silicon-sphere mass prototype places additional restrictions on the procedures that might be suitable to clean it to avoid changing the layer's thickness or oxide stoichiometry.|$|E
