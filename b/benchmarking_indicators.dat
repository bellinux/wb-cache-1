40|$|The Lisbon {{process is}} {{intended}} to move the European Union (EU) towards a dynamic but socially inclusive knowledge-based economy. Policy benchmarking through the 'Open Method of Coordination' is being applied {{to a wide range}} of relevant policy areas. This article considers the <b>benchmarking</b> <b>indicators</b> that are being used in relation to the knowledge-based economy on the one hand, social inclusion on the other. It examines the indicators that have been selected, the uses to which they are being put and their appropriateness for policy coordination, policy learning and performance improvement. It explores three ambiguities or tensions that they reveal. First, the article argues that being in part the offspring of the process of monetary union, the OMC is being used to track progress towards a single future, rather than to expose the range of possible alternative futures and the trade-offs they involve. Second, whereas the goal of the Lisbon process is a dynamic knowledge-based economy, the article argues that the <b>benchmarking</b> <b>indicators</b> are remarkably static and it sets out what dynamic indicators would be more appropriate. Finally, whereas patterns of social and economic development are increasingly shaped by global processes, the Lisbon process remains focussed on action at the national level: the article argues the case for a stronger global dimension for indicators of change. The article concludes by considering the implications of its findings for governance and accountability in the EU...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} {{to the analysis of}} the Caribbean's growth performance by setting out a framework for <b>benchmarking</b> <b>indicators</b> of key micro drivers and related structural policies that help explain differentials in productivity and real GDP per capita across the region, and relative to non-regional benchmark countries. The framework is adapted from the OECD's Going for Growth exercises. Its emphasis on micro-drivers in the labor market and the business environment aims to help shift the focus of the current discussions on growth from macroeconomic considerations (e. g. fiscal sustainability, exports) toward an exploration of productivity, which the literature identifies as the principal constraint to growth in the Caribbean and elsewhere. Potential advantages of a benchmarking-for-growth framework include knowledge sharing of the policies and performance indicators related to productivity in the Caribbean and appropriate benchmark countries. This could help stimulate further research and public discussion on the underlying factors behind the divergence in incomes {{as well as on the}} policies and environments that contribute to those differentials. An initial exercise highlights issues with restrictions for starting a business, the tax burden, the cost of imports and infrastructure deficiencies as potential barriers to growth. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{territorial}} competitiveness has gained ground in academic, policy and practitioner circles. In particular, urban competitiveness has generated a large literature. However, {{there is a}} danger that competitiveness at a territorial level becomes a conceptual chimera. The essential problem is that territorially based actors and agencies seek to position and maintain the utility of their regions and subregions by reference to a set of measures and indicators that are conceptually suspect and often empirically weak. The degree to which regions compete depends on a manifold set of factors. The paper proposes a conceptual framework for regional competitiveness based on combining the competitive advantage of firms and the comparative advantage of a regional economy. The conceptual transmission mechanism to regional competitiveness combines Liebenstein's theory of 'X-inefficiency' and agglomeration economies. The paper begins with a review of competitiveness and its literature. It then investigates the regional balance of payment constraint {{in the absence of a}} real regional exchange rate. In conclusion, it asks whether the conceptual approach was appropriate for a study of <b>benchmarking</b> <b>indicators</b> for the London region in comparison with other metropolises. ...|$|E
40|$|The Construction {{industry}} has been dealing with much trouble due to global economic recession and domestic political trends emphasizing on welfare than development. Consequently, domestic construction market has been dramatically shrunk during the last a few years, and international market has become the only potential solution for the industry. However, there has been lack of efforts in developing a quantified measure of global competencies for Korean engineering and construction organizations. This study attempted to develop quantified indices for Korean engineering and construction contractors with which the level of global construction competencies can be objectively monitored. In doing so, a survey questionnaire was developed to identify relative importances of core competency elements which were derived from extensive literature reviews and experts interviews. AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) was employed as a main analysis method in developing quantification measures. The analysis results reveal little differences in competency requirements between engineering and construction firms and it implies that the global market becomes more integrated and requires a total solution for a construction project. The developed core competency measures {{can be used to}} quantify the level of preparedness of Korean engineering and construction firms at the time of evaluation and also be used as a basis for performance <b>benchmarking</b> <b>indicators</b> if they are compared with business showings...|$|E

40|$|Even if one may {{agree with}} the {{possible}} criticism of the Lisbon process as being too vague in com-mitment or as lacking appropriate statistical techniques and indicators, the benchmarking system pro-vided by EUROSTAT seems to be sufficiently effective in warning against imminent failure. The Lisbon objectives are very demanding. This holds true even if each of the objectives is looked at in isolation. But 'Lisbon ' is more demanding than that, requiring a combination of several objectives to be achieved simultaneously (GDP growth, labour productivity, job-content of growth, higher quality of jobs and greater social cohesion). Even to countries like Ireland, showing exceptionally high performance in GDP growth and employment promotion during the period under investigation, achieving potentially conflicting objectives simultaneously seems to be beyond feasibility. The European Union benchmark-ing exercise {{is embedded in the}} context of the Open Method(s) of Co-ordination (OMC). This context makes the benchmarking approach part and parcel of an overarching philosophy, which relates the <b>benchmarking</b> <b>indicators</b> to each other and assigns to them their role in corroborating the increasingly dominating project of the 'embedded neo-liberalism'. Against this background, the present paper is focussed on the following point. With the EU bench-marking system being effective enough to make the imminent under-achievement visible, there is a danger of disillusionment and 'benchmarking fatigue', which may provoke an ideological crisis.

Water allocation to various stakeholders is a complex issue due to increasing demand. Due to population increase, {{it is difficult to}} meet the demand of food in resources available worldwide. Therefore, it is a primary objective to ensure optimal utilisation of water within an available resource. Major consumer of water is Irrigation. About 83 % share is consumed by Irrigation. But it is evident from statistics that only 40 % potential is utilised in India because of poor maintenance of canal, flooding methods adopted in larger part of country for application of water and inadequate facilities for irrigation services.
