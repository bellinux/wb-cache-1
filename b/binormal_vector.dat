The kinematic solution itself is explained in 'Filament winding', Part II. The hereby presented strategy starts with the description of some general equations reflecting on the derivation of the tangent, normal and <b>binormal</b> <b>vectors,</b> curvatures and torsion. From the most general case of non-rotationally symmetric surfaces, a reduction is realised towards shells of revolution, which form the most popular class of objects created with filament winding techniques. The associated fibre paths may be (non-) geodesic. The final formulation is expressed in angular parameters that are closely related to the design process of the shell to be wound, and does not suffer from cumulative error generation. Additionally, the associated required calculation time seems to be generally significantly shorter when compared to wound surface discretisation techniques. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract. In this {{proceedings}} {{article we}} shall survey {{a series of}} results on the stability of self-similar solutions of the vortex filament equation. This equation is a geometric flow for curves in R 3 and it {{is used as a}} model for the evolution of a vortex filament in fluid mechanics. The main theorem gives, under suitable assumptions, the existence and description of solutions generated by curves with a corner, for positive and negative times. Its companion theorem describes the evolution of perturbations of self-similar solutions up to a singularity formation in finite time, and beyond this time. We shall give a sketch of the proof. These results were obtained in collaboration with Luis Vega. In the first section we shall present the vortex filament equation. Then in the second section we shall give the topics we are interested in, and state our results. The sketch of the proofs will be given in the last section. 1. The Vortex Filament Equation The vortex filament equation (VFE) is the geometric flow of curves χ(t) in R 3 governed by (1) χt = χx ∧ χxx. Here x stands for the arclength parameter of the curve χ(t).

40|$|The {{calculation}} of the minimum distance between surfaces {{plays an important role}} in computational mechanics, namely, in the study of constrained multibody systems where contact forces take part. In this paper, a general rigid contact detection methodology for non-conformal bodies, described by ellipsoidal and superellipsoidal surfaces, is presented. The mathematical framework relies on simple algebraic and differential geometry, vector calculus, and on the C 2 continuous implicit representations of the surfaces. The proposed methodology establishes a set of collinear and orthogonal constraints between vectors defining the contacting surfaces that, allied with loci constraints, which are specific to the type of surface being used, formulate the contact problem. This set of non-linear equations is solved numerically with the Newton-Raphson method with Jacobian matrices calculated analytically. The method outputs the coordinates of the pair of points with common normal vector directions and, consequently, the minimum distance between both surfaces. Contrary to other contact detection methodologies, the proposed mathematical framework does not rely on polygonal-based geometries neither on complex non-linear optimization formulations. Furthermore, the methodology is extendable to other surfaces that are (strictly) convex, interact in a non-conformal fashion, present an implicit representation, and that are at least C 2 continuous. Two distinct methods for calculating the tangent and <b>binormal</b> <b>vectors</b> to the implicit surfaces are introduced: (i) a method based on the Householder reflection matrix; and (ii) a method based on a square plate rotation mechanism. The first provides a base of three orthogonal vectors, in which one of them is collinear to the surface normal. For the latter, it is shown that, by means of an analogy to the referred mechanism, at least two non-collinear vectors to the normal vector can be determined. Complementarily, several mathematical and computational aspects, regarding the rigid contact detection methodology, are described. The proposed methodology is applied to several case tests involving the contact between different (super) ellipsoidal contact pairs. Numerical results show that the implemented methodology is highly efficient and accurate for ellipsoids and superellipsoids. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT...|$|R
