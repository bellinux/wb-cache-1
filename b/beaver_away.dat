40|$|Abstract Heavy metals are {{persistent}} environmental contam-inants, {{and wild}} animals are increasingly {{exposed to the}} harmful effects of compounds of anthropogenic origin, even in areas distant from industrial centers. We used atomic ab-sorption spectrometry to determine levels of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) in liver and kidney of wild Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber) in Poland. Cd concen-trations in liver (0. 21 ± 0. 44 μg/g) and in kidney (2. 81 ± 4. 52 μg/g) were lower in juvenile than in adult beavers. Pb concentrations in liver (0. 08 ± 0. 03 μg/g) and kidney (0. 08 ± 0. 03 μg/g) were similar among all individuals, while both Cu and Zn levels were higher in liver (Cu 9. 2 ± 4. 5 μg/g; Zn 35. 7 ± 3. 5 μg/g) than in kidney (Cu 3. 7 ± 1. 1 μg/g; Zn 21. 5 ± 2. 7 μg/ g). Cu levels also differed between juveniles and adults. We reviewed the literature reporting metal concentrations in bea-vers. Our results indicate metal contamination in <b>beavers</b> <b>away</b> from important industrial emission sources and suggest the natural environment should be regularly monitored to ensure their levels are below recommended, legal values...|$|R
40|$|Beavers were re-introduced in the Biesbosch, The Netherlands, a wood {{dominated}} by willows Salix spp. Conservationists expected that herbivory by beavers would enhance succession to a mixed broad-leaved forest. Willows formed the staple food of the beavers, but they removed only 1. 4 % of the standing crop. rn the future, this might increase to 5 %, which is roughly {{one-third of the}} regrowth of these willows. Non-willow species such as Alnus, Corylus, Fraxinus, Populus and Prunus were very uncommon in the Biesbosch, but they were positively selected by <b>beavers</b> <b>away</b> fr om the den and - in one year - away from the water. Beavers were possibly selecting complementary nutrients, choosing Corylus and Fraxinus for Na, and Prunus and Populus for p. Alternatively, {{they may have been}} eating a mixed diet as a strategy to avoid dietary deficiencies of whatever type. We conclude that the beavers will not enhance the succession to a more mixed forest, because they selectively remove non-willow tree species. In any case, we doubt whether such a succession would take place without restoration of a more natural water regime...|$|R

The Beavers managed to hold the Cornhuskers to just 6 points in the first half, and were poised to score again in the third quarter when they secured a 1st and goal position on the Nebraska 5-yard line. Nebraska's defense suddenly solidified and sent the <b>Beavers</b> <b>away</b> with no points for their trouble as the quarter ended. It looked like it might be a battle to the end when events suddenly turned against the favor of the Beavers when they flubbed a punt return and then lost their momentum. After that, the game was all Nebraska when Oregon State failed to find traction {{in the face of a}} Nebraska safety and two interceptions. Coach Bible sent in the reserves late in the game, and they managed a touchdown of their own in just two plays as time expired.

40|$|In {{her speech}} to the CSIRO-Monash Superannuation Research Cluster Conference 2016 in Melbourne, the Productivity Commission 2 ̆ 7 s deputy chair says {{evidence}} based research is a critically endangered beast. Introduction Good morning. And welcome to the 2016 CSIRO-Monash Superannuation Conference. Today, you will hear and learn of the endeavors of the super research cluster. And research dividends {{in a field of}} public policy endeavour that matters. Today the 2 trillion behemoth meant to deliver better retirement incomes for working Australians. And some would argue it’s a field of much policy tinkering, but perhaps less well informed public policy design and development. So when Deborah Ralston asked me to open the conference — my response was a resounding yes. For the PC shares much in common with the cluster. My Commissioner colleague, Angela McRae who is also here today, represents the PC on the cluster’s steering committee. And Angela and I, along with our PC team, have been <b>beavering</b> <b>away</b> in the retirement incomes space over the past 18 months. And {{will continue to do so}} for the foreseeable future thanks to David Murray. And our work has benefitted from the insights Deborah and her cluster colleagues have shared with us along the way. But this good old fashioned evidence-based research you will hear about today has much in common with the black rhino. A critically endangered beast — seldom seen and rarely funded. For today we find ourselves struggling to deal with what should not be intractable policy issues. And why intractable? I fear it is because three simple but essential prerequisites to good public policy are sorely missing in action. Now the first prerequisite missing in action is evidence-based policy research and analysis. Something core to the cluster and the Productivity Commission’s DNA. The second essential prerequisite and very much missing in action, is policy and program evaluation. The third, and arguably the twin sibling of evaluation, is experimentation or piloting. And for the PC, these are the essential E’s of good public policy...|$|R
40|$|Watermarks. The term evokes {{visions of}} shady {{characters}} secretly <b>beavering</b> <b>away</b> in dark basements surrounded by forged $ 100 bills drying on clothes lines. In a digital media context, {{away from the}} traditional world of inks and paper, the same old problem remains but it relates not just to forgery but also to outright theft, because one digital copy can spawn millions of others with the single click of a mouse button. It {{is hardly surprising that}} the notion of a digital watermark has stimulated avid interest amongst artists and publishers alike. It is commonly recognized that digital watermarks must be as robust as the media in which they are embedded. For example, a rotated, cropped, and rescanned water-marked image should still be a watermarked image. However, this robustness requirement directly conflicts with the need for a digital watermark to be unobtrusive. The most effective techniques used to embed watermarks are the result of a combination of secret key-based techniques used for military communication and simple models of the human visual system. The most familiar application for digital watermarks is for copyright protection and protection of intellectual property. On its own, a watermark does not provide any legal proof of ownership. In other words, the use of a given digital watermark to protect intellectual property must be registered with a trusted third party to be of any value. Any technique for embedding robust digital watermarks must be compatible with methods for registering copyright. A watermark's resistance to intentional and unintentional degradation has been the main subject of interest in the watermarking community. The main challenges are geometric transformations such as change of proportion or simple rescaling. One watermark removal technique that is supplied on the Internet simply shifts a corner of the image. Lossy image compression such as JPEG and filtering are more easily overcome and, generally speaking, watermarks have evolved into very resistant forms. The laboratory, but will they really work in the real world...|$|R

2500|$|In 1926, a {{sighting}} {{is claimed}} to have occurred at an Okanagan Mission beach. This event was supposedly witnessed by about thirty cars of people who all {{claimed to have}} seen the same thing.

A computer analysis of the footage concluded it was a solid, three-dimensional object.

An investigation conducted by Benjamin Radford with Joe Nickell and John Kirk for the National Geographic Channel TV show Is It Real?, in 2005 revealed that the object Folden filmed was indeed a real animal but its size had been greatly overestimated.

60|$|While {{examining}} the den {{of a bank}} beaver last summer another theory suggested itself. Is not {{this one of the}} rare animals in which all the instincts of his kind are lacking? He does not build because he has no impulse to build; he does not know how. So he represents what the beaver was, thousands of years ago, before he learned how to construct his dam and house, reappearing now by some strange freak of heredity, and finding himself wofully out of place and time. The other <b>beavers</b> drive him <b>away</b> because all gregarious animals and birds have a strong fear and dislike of any irregularity in their kind. Even when the peculiarity is slight--a wound, or a deformity--they drive the poor victim from their midst remorselessly. It is a cruel instinct, but part of one of the oldest in creation, the instinct which preserves the species. This explains why the bank beaver never finds a mate; none of the beavers will {{have anything to do with}} him.|$|R
50|$|Before an {{enthusiastic}} crowd of 48,503 at Arizona Stadium, Oregon State {{had to go}} without starting quarterback Lyle Moevao, sidelined by a shoulder injury. Then they lost tailback Jacquizz Rodgers, the Pac-10's leading rusher and Pac-10 Player of the Year candidate, to a shoulder injury on their second possession. With the score tied at 10-10 {{early in the fourth}} quarter (on a 16-yard touchdown pass to Arizona TE Rob Gronkowski with 16 seconds left in the third quarter), Oregon State head coach Mike Riley went for it twice on fourth down near midfield. The first one worked and the second did not, and it proved costly. After backup tailback Ryan McCants lost a yard on fourth-and-1 at Arizona's 49, the Wildcats went on an eight-play march capped by a 9-yard touchdown run by RB Keola Antolin to give Arizona a 17-10 lead. Oregon State responded with a 10-play, 80-yard drive for a touchdown. Then, Beavers kicker Justin Kahut missed the extra point with 3:58 left, seemingly giving Arizona the chance for the win. Arizona's offense stalled, and while the Wildcats led 17-16 with 1:19 to play, Oregon State took over at their own 20 with no timeouts left. Oregon State quarterback Sean Canfield, who started in place of Moevao, hit Jeremy Francis for a 20-yard catch to the 40. A seven-yard run by receiver James Rodgers went to the 47. On the third play of the drive, Canfield found Sammie Stroughter alone behind the Wildcats secondary for a 47-yard gain to the Arizona 7. Then, Kahut calmly nailed a 24-yard field goal as time expired to seal an improbable 19-17 victory, redeeming himself and leaving the <b>Beavers</b> one win <b>away</b> from their first Rose Bowl trip since 1965. Keola Antolin rushed for 114 yards and a touchdown for Arizona, while Arizona QB Willie Tuitama threw for 158 yards and a score.|$|R
500|$|It was {{not easy}} for the HBC to drive the Americans away from the North West Coast. The Americans had decades of {{experience}} and knew the coast's complex physical and human geography. It took until 1835 for the HBC to gain this level of experience, but the Americans still had several advantages. For {{a number of reasons}} they were willing and able to pay high prices for furs—much higher than the HBC could match without taking large financial losses. The American ventures were global in scope. They tapped multiple markets of which the North West Coast was but one. By the 1820s American ships routinely spent years in the Pacific, making several voyages between various places such as California, Hawaii, the Philippines, and Canton. American ships were usually stocked with a surplus of trade goods intended for trade on the North West Coast. It was always best to get rid of any extra trade goods on the North West Coast, [...] "dumping" [...] them at any price, before leaving. They would use up stowage space that could be used more profitably elsewhere. The HBC therefore faced a major challenge even after they became experienced with the coast's geography and indigenous peoples. The American system not only raised the price of furs but also lowered the value of trade goods. Furthermore, the indigenous people knew that increased competition served their interests and gave them bargaining power. They had no desire to see the Americans abandon the coast trade. Therefore, the HBC had to not just match but exceed the prices paid by Americans if they hoped to drive the Americans <b>away.</b> <b>Beaver</b> fur prices on the coast could be many times what the HBC was paying in the interior. There was no hope of making a profit. In order to compete on the coast the HBC had to take large, long-term financial losses.|$|R
40|$|Is the Howard {{government}} {{having second}} thoughts, asks MARGARET SIMONS LET the games begin! Probably, perhaps, and before too long. Maybe. Australia?s media companies are all cashed up and raring to go, but Senator Helen Coonan {{has yet to}} say when she plans to fire the gun and proclaim the new media ownership laws, triggering a flurry of takeovers and mergers. Meanwhile Shadow Communications Minister Stephen Conroy?s office claims ?active consideration? is being given {{to the question of}} what to do if the laws are not proclaimed and Labor comes to power. Proclamation can?t occur until the Australian Communications and Media Authority has finished its homework. There are two parts to this: completion of a register of ownership, and work to do with the licence conditions for regional broadcasters to ensure levels of local content and declaration of cross ownership following mergers. ACMA told Senate Estimates late last month that this work would be completed within weeks. Yet, under questioning, Coonan would commit only to proclamation sometime this year. ?We?re not entering into any speculation on timelines,? a spokeswoman said. So is the Howard government having second thoughts? A media feeding frenzy, fuelled by anonymous foreign private equity cash may be the last thing the government needs in an election year when there are already sensitivities about iconic local companies falling into foreign hands. On the other hand the government can hardly afford to make enemies of the big media companies by leaving them all cashed up with nowhere to go. It would be extraordinary if the government, having come this far, squibbed it. Fifteen billion dollars of media deals hang in the balance. Let?s recap on the contenders cashed up, poised and waiting for the starter?s gun. Both Kerry Stokes? Channel Seven and the Packer organisation have brought in private equity cash through deals that can?t be fully consummated until the laws go through. Both organisations will be buyers ? though Packer may be more interested in casinos than media. Channel Ten?s foreign owners have hung out a ?for sale? sign. The O?Reilly family?s Independent News and Media, also fuelled by private equity, is trying to buy out the shares it doesn?t own in APN with plans to use that company as a base for expansion. This week the O?Reilly family?s Dublin-based PR flak declined to rule out a bid for Fairfax ? or for anything else. The Macquarie Bank is interested in expansion ? perhaps in the WIN regional television network and other regional broadcasting assets. Fairfax and Rural Press are planning to merge ? if another deal doesn?t pip that at the post. Telstra, Fairfax and others are awaiting the auction of the two new datacasting licences. And beneath the radar of most media commentary, foreign players are quietly flexing. Javier Moll, whose Prensa Iberica is a leading publisher in Spain and Portugal and who already owns the Adelaide Review, is quietly building a national stable of street magazines. There may be other plans. Moll has long hungered for his own Australian metropolitan daily newspaper. Meanwhile Labor has said precisely nothing about what it will do should it come to power with the media laws not yet proclaimed. Shadow Minister for Communications Stephen Conroy has condemned what Coonan has done without offering an alternative plan. Conroy?s office promises a comprehensive media policy will emerge after Labor?s federal conference at the end of April. Perhaps someone is <b>beavering</b> <b>away</b> on it, but Labor insiders say little work has been done on the detail so far. It is not seen as one of the issues that will turn the votes that Labor needs. Some indication of the quality of thought in Labor ranks was contained in the 2 March announcement of 3 billion of planned cost cutting should the Opposition come to power. Hidden down the bottom of the media release was a line item of 22. 1 million in savings to be garnered by reversing Minister Helen Coonan?s decisions to create Digital Australia and increase funding for the Australian Communications and Media Authority. Digital Australia is to be the main agency charged with the vital job of pushing Australia towards a digital broadcasting future. Its role is outlined here (PDF). Meanwhile ACMA already has a reputation for slowness, particularly in dealing with public complaints, and has recently been given lots of extra homework. Mark Day detailed the existing workload in the Australian, and this is just the start. Once Coonan?s media ownership regulations are proclaimed, ACMA?s workload will balloon as media mergers are proposed and need to be assessed. ACMA and the competition regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission are already gearing up, announcing plans to share information as merger proposals are announced. So what would Labor do instead? When I quizzed Conroy?s office on the detail there was initially confusion about whether the plan was to ditch Digital Australia or to get the industry to fund it. Once that was sorted, Conroy?s office said that Digital Australia would be ditched because its functions could be handled within the Department of Communications from existing resources. The creation of Digital Australia was mere ?face saving? after ten years of government bungling, Conroy?s spokesman said. There is something in that. The bungling is undeniable, mainly under the watch of Coonan?s predecessor, Senator Richard Alston. But as for ACMA, Conroy?s office says the reason for its increased workload is the minister 2 ̆ 7 s ?obsession with ducking the tough decisions and hand balling political issues to ACMA? This would not be the case under a Labor government. ? We are entitled to be cynical. While there is truth in the line about ducking tough decisions there is no indication from Conroy as to how he expects ACMA to do all its current work plus the extra resulting from media mergers without more resources. Surely Conroy is not suggesting that the minister should decide which media mergers are allowed and which should be blocked? That would be a risky and unwarranted intervention in functions better carried out independently of politics. It is a bit rich for Conroy to run the ?ducking? line when Labor has failed to say what it will do if it comes to power and the media ownership laws have not been proclaimed. Now there?s a tough one, and so far it is Labor that is doing the ducking. The issue is a minefield. Labor can?t afford to make media enemies either, but a new Labor government would have to move quickly if it wanted to stop the laws. If not proclaimed, they will automatically come into force on 1 January 2008. That means a new Labor government would need to come up with fresh legislation very fast, and get it through the Senate, where it is most unlikely to have a majority. Roll on national conference. If Conroy can?t come up with something gutsy and workable after that, we will all know who is the duck. Stephen Allen, media analyst of Fusion Strategy, thinks there is little chance that the government will squib the proclamation, but suggests the government?s poor poll results could mean delay, precisely to make the media companies nervous and enable ?the calling in of favours? as close as possible to the election date. Meanwhile it?s worth remembering that just about all the major ownership moves so far have taken the analysts by surprise. The truth is nobody really knows what will happen. Not even, to her chagrin, Senator Helen Coonan ? who was once foolish enough to say she didn?t think there would be big changes as the result of her laws. The only thing we can be sure of is that she got that wrong. ? Margaret Simons is a freelance journalist and author. Her new book about the media will be published later this year by Penguin.
