25|$|Discrimination on {{the basis}} of {{nationality}} is usually included in employment laws (see above section for employment discrimination specifically). It is sometimes referred to as bound together with racial discrimination although it can be separate. It may vary from laws that stop refusals of hiring <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>nationality,</b> asking questions regarding origin, to prohibitions of firing, forced retirement, compensation and pay, etc., <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>nationality.</b>|$|E
25|$|Relatives {{of three}} Armenian {{soldiers}} killed and beheaded during the escalation {{filed a complaint}} against Azerbaijan to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).

25|$|There were 54,746 {{people of}} {{indigenous}} heritage living in Sydney in 2011. Most immigrants to Sydney between 1840 and 1930 were British, Irish or Chinese. There were significant clusters of people <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>nationality</b> or religion {{throughout the history}} of Sydney development. In the early 20th century Irish people were centred in Surry Hills, the Scottish in Paddington.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this dissertation were to: (1) discover whether commenters and non-commenters {{on an international}} marketing questionnaire differ <b>based</b> <b>on</b> sociodemographic, <b>nationality,</b> and personality characteristics; (2) determine whether commenters with greater life satisfaction {{are more likely to}} provide positive comments; (3) determine whether commenters differ in response styles due to their national background; and (4) discover whether commenters differ (<b>based</b> <b>on</b> sociodemo-graphic, <b>nationality,</b> and personality characteristics) in their propensity to comment on the design rather than on other questionnaire issues. An exploratory design was used to satisfy these objectives...|$|R

25|$|Officially, Hungarian {{electoral laws}} never {{contained}} any legal discrimination <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>nationality</b> or language. The high census suffrage {{was not uncommon}} in other European countries in the 1860s but later the countries of Western Europe gradually lowered and at last abolished their census suffrage. That never happened in the Kingdom of Hungary, although electoral reform {{was one of the}} main topics of political debates in the last decades before World War I.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the lack}} of basic {{amenities}} and medical facilities in Haiti a large number of Haitian women, often arriving with several health problems, cross the border to Dominican soil. They deliberately come during their last weeks of pregnancy to obtain medical attention for childbirth, since Dominican public hospitals do not refuse medical services <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>nationality</b> or legal status. Statistics from a hospital in Santo Domingo report that over 22% of childbirths are by Haitian mothers.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} is slightly more complex if electronic formatting {{is to be}} used. Where distribution is to be by CD-ROM or other physical media, {{there is no reason}} to treat this form differently from a paper format, and national copyright is an acceptable approach. But the possibility of Internet download without the ability to restrict physical distribution within national boundaries presents legal problems that are usually solved by selling language or translation rights rather than national rights. Thus, Internet access across the European Union is relatively open because of the laws forbidding discrimination <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>nationality,</b> but the fact of publication in, say, France, limits the target market to those who read French.|$|E

500|$|Svalbard lies {{under the}} {{sovereignty}} of Norway, but the Svalbard Treaty places several restrictions. Norway cannot use the archipelago for warlike purposes, cannot discriminate economic activity <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>nationality</b> and is required to conserve the natural environment. Uniquely, Svalbard is entirely visa-free zone. Everybody may {{live and work in}} Svalbard indefinitely regardless country of citizenship. Svalbard Treaty grants treaty nationals equal right of abode as Norwegian nationals. Non-treaty nationals may live and work indefinitely visa-free as well.

2500|$|By the 1960s, {{the policy}} of {{excluding}} people <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>nationality</b> yielded a population overwhelmingly European in origin. By the mid-1960s, a desire for cheap unskilled labour led to ethnic diversification. In the 1950s and 1960s, New Zealand encouraged migrants from the South Pacific. The country had a large demand for unskilled labour in the manufacturing sector. As long as this demand continued, migration was accepted from the South Pacific, and many temporary workers overstayed their visas. From 1974 to 1979 dawn raids were carried out by police to remove overstayers, {{most of whom were}} Pacific Islanders. In May 2008, Massey University economist Dr Greg Clydesdale released to the news media an extract of a report, Growing Pains, Evaluations and the Cost of Human Capital, which saw Pacific Islanders as [...] "forming an underclass".|$|E

2500|$|The word Gaill (plural of Gall) {{etymologically}} originates from [...] "Gauls", who in pre-Viking Gaelic history {{were the}} archetypal [...] "foreigners". Dumville says that [...] "what [...] {{had done in}} Gaelic prehistory to gain that status is unknown and was probably unpleasant." [...] During the Viking age, it came to denote Scandinavians or those of Scandinavian descent or speech. From the Norman invasion of Ireland in the late 12th century, this appellation was passed on to foreigners of French speech {{and then to the}} English at large. The word did not denote [...] "foreigner" [...] in the sense [...] "anyone not Irish (Gaelic)", but the Saxons, Welsh and Picts are identified as such in the Irish annals, and there are also terms used which may identify the Scandinavians <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>nationality,</b> like Dene, Northmanni and Lochlainn.|$|E
2500|$|The current Extradition Treaty {{between the}} United States of America and the United Mexican States (see 31 U.S.T. 5061) {{was signed by}} President Jimmy Carter in 1978 and {{went into effect in}} 1980. [...] Like many such treaties, it {{provides}} for the extradition of a party who has been charged with or found guilty of an offense committed in the United States, who has fled to Mexico. An offense is extraditable if it is a crime in both countries and punishable by incarceration for a period of one year or more. [...] In theory this allows for the extradition of child abductors who have absconded to Mexico as child abduction is a federal crime there. [...] In practice US authorities rarely request extradition in preference of Hague Convention litigation and, even when they do, Mexico is not bound to deliver up its nationals. [...] If extradition is denied <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>nationality,</b> the request for extradition is automatically converted into a foreign prosecution pursuant to Article IV of the Mexican Federal Penal Code. [...] Although by law Mexican authorities are authorized to extradite their own nationals in “exceptional circumstances”, [...] in practice they most often will refuse to do so. [...] (See “Ley De Extradicion Internacional”, enacted May 19, 1897, revised [...] January 10, 1994: “extradition of Mexican nationals is prohibited except in “exceptional” circumstances”.) [...] “Nationality” is also liberally construed and often, marriage to a national, having dual citizenship, parents or other close relatives who are Mexican nationals, or simply having a Hispanic surname will suffice for purposes of extradition.|$|E

30|$|Analyses of cross {{cultural}} {{data collected}} in the mid- 20 th century show that similarities and differences in cultures’ affective meanings are not <b>based</b> <b>on</b> geography, <b>nationality,</b> or religious creed. Cultures do vary along two major dimensions which seem to be secularism-versus-ecclesiasticism, and a dimension relating to colonialism and slavery that contrasts cultures of the controllers with cultures that emerged among the controlled.|$|R
50|$|The {{race was}} one of several trials for the Prix du Jockey Club collectively known as the Poules des Produits.

50|$|The term {{economic}} oppression {{changes in}} meaning and significance over time, depending on its contextual application.

50|$|Studies {{have found}} that some auto dealerships charge higher {{interest}} rates or otherwise raise their prices to females and ethnic minorities, including Asians, and African Americans.

50|$|National oppression is the {{systematic}} mistreatment {{of a people}} <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>nationality.</b> National oppression frequently {{takes the form of}} an imperialist nation politically and economically dominating another nation, often a formerly colonized nation in the Global South.
