Deciding whether <b>agreements</b> should involve <b>binding</b> or nonbinding <b>agreements</b> is {{a crucial}} {{strategic}} element {{when it comes to}} designing effective governance systems. Until today, legally <b>binding</b> <b>agreements</b> seem to be the preferred approach. Over 1500 bilateral and 900 multilateral treaties have been signed so far. Yet, {{at least some of them}} have proven ineffective if not counterproductive for solving the problems they were negotiated for. Therefore, it is at no surprise that states increasingly use a different approach for solving transboundary environmental problems: Nonbinding agreements. Instead of signing legally <b>binding</b> <b>agreements,</b> state officials negotiate international norms that are intentionally nonbinding but still possess legal relevance. Key theoretical arguments suggest that nonbinding agreements can be (at least) equally effective as binding treaties. Yet, empirically, the rather simple question whether nonbinding commitments are more effective in solving international environmental problems than <b>binding</b> <b>agreements</b> remains open. The lack of systematic efforts to compare the effectiveness of <b>binding</b> and nonbinding <b>agreements</b> under comparable conditions is recognized as a significant gap i...|$|R

The result was that the Alliance declined to recognize women’s wrestling. Wolfe had regained his stake. The result was that his son’s wife June Byers (real name DeAlva Eyvonnie Sibley), was touted as world champ following a tournament in Baltimore. Wolfe’s girlfriend Nell Stewart was recognized as Women’s U.S. Titleholder. Many women were loyal to Burke and refused to wrestle for Wolfe.|$|E

25|$|Many {{contracts}} {{and other forms}} of legally <b>binding</b> <b>agreement</b> include a jurisdiction or arbitration clause specifying the parties' choice of venue for any litigation (called a forum selection clause). Then, choice of law clauses may specify which laws the court or tribunal should apply to each aspect of the dispute. This matches the substantive policy of freedom of contract. Judges have accepted that the principle of party autonomy allows the parties to select the law most appropriate to their transaction. This judicial acceptance of subjective intent excludes the traditional reliance on objective connecting factors; it also harms consumers as vendors often impose one-sided contractual terms selecting a venue far from the buyer's home or workplace.|$|E

The number of simultaneous bidders is of critical importance. Open bidding during {{an extended period of}} time with many bidders will result in a final bid that is very close to the true market value. Where there are few bidders and each bidder is allowed only one bid, time is saved, but the winning bid may not reflect the true market value with any degree of accuracy. Of special interest and importance during the actual auction is the time elapsed from the moment that the first bid is revealed to the moment that the final (winning) bid has become a <b>binding</b> <b>agreement.</b>|$|E
25|$|Open {{adoption}} allows {{identifying information}} to be communicated between adoptive and biological parents and, perhaps, interaction between kin and the adopted person. Rarely, it is the outgrowth of laws that maintain an adoptee's right to unaltered birth certificates and/or adoption records, but such access is not universal (it is possible in a few jurisdictions—including the UK and six states in the United States). Open adoption can be an informal arrangement subject to termination by adoptive parents who have sole authority over the child. In some jurisdictions, the biological and adoptive parents may enter into a legally enforceable and <b>binding</b> <b>agreement</b> concerning visitation, exchange of information, or other interaction regarding the child. As of February 2009, 24 U.S. states allowed legally enforceable open adoption contract agreements {{to be included in}} the adoption finalization.|$|E

This paper investigates {{this in a}} two-country economy where governments regulate labour markets through national labour standards, but {{are subject}} to lobbying. We study four different lobbying architectures and show that cross-national externalities are fully internalized in two cases: (i) when governments enter <b>binding</b> international <b>agreements</b> and (ii) when international lobbying is complete. In cases where international lobbying is incomplete, e. g., because of disagreement among lobby groups in different countries or direct bans on lobbying of foreign governments, internalization is also incomplete and a role remains for governments to enter into <b>binding</b> <b>agreements.</b> ...|$|R

However, due to the unresolved Chinese Civil War, neither the newly established People's Republic of China (PRC) in mainland China nor the Nationalist ROC that retreated to Taiwan was invited to sign the Treaty of San Francisco, as neither had shown full and complete legal capacity to enter into an international legally <b>binding</b> <b>agreement.</b> Since China was not present, the Japanese only formally renounced the territorial sovereignty of Taiwan and Penghu islands without specifying to which country Japan relinquished the sovereignty, and the treaty was signed in 1951 and came into force in 1952.|$|E
25|$|In June 2009, concert {{promoter}} Allgood Entertainment, {{represented by}} Ira Meyerowitz and Jon Kekielek of MJlawfirm, sued Jackson for $40 million, {{claiming that the}} singer, through his manager Frank DiLeo, had agreed to a single and a $30 million reunion concert with The Jackson 5, as well as sister Janet Jackson. According to the concert promoter, the alleged contractual agreement prevented the singer from performing elsewhere before the reunion concert and for a three-month period after it. Thus, agreeing to a 50 date residency at the O2 arena was an alleged breach of the Allgood Entertainment contract. The filing company stated that AEG Live knew of the alleged agreement with Jackson and used their dominance in the industry to coerce Jackson into agreeing to the residency. In August 2010, the judge dismissed the case, stating {{that there was no}} evidence of a <b>binding</b> <b>agreement,</b> no contracts were signed. The case was in limbo as of 2013.|$|E
