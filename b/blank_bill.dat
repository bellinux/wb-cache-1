5000|$|Each game turn {{represents}} a year, {{which takes place}} during seven stages represented on the board's [...] "political track". The game ends when the President cannot draw eight bills from the foreign aid money {{at the beginning of}} a turn. This event is disguised by the <b>blank</b> <b>bills</b> placed at the bottom of the foreign aid deck and by the [...] "used" [...] bills which are placed under the blanks when spent as part of a card action. A typical game will have 9-11 rounds. The winner is the player who has the most money in his or her Swiss bank account at the end of the game. Money on one's person is irrelevant.|$|R
50|$|After the 1901 reorganization, the company’s {{name was}} changed to State Printing House. The state budget and its justification, the {{appropriation}} accounts, the important bills, the Financial Gazette and the time-tables of the Hungarian State Railways were printed in the State Printing House. Hungarian Royal Treasury Notes, different treasury bills, state promissory notes, annuity loan notes, class lottery tickets, <b>blank</b> <b>bills,</b> bills of lading of domestic and foreign freights and cigar and tobacco packaging materials and tax stamps were also produced there. The Hungarian government founded the Hungarian Banknote Printing House in 1922 which started domestic banknote printing in August 1923 in the buildings of the State Printing House. During World War II, the printing house served as a war factory producing food and fuel notes. After the war, the documents of the post and the railway were printed again as well as state forms, bonds and lottery tickets. For the 1945 election, State Printing House printed the election forms, later it produced the tax notes during the 1946 hyperinflation. The company has been producing lottery forms and tickets since 1947. Besides production of lottery forms and tickets, the production of election forms every four years also became stable part of the production portfolio. Due to the investment in 1957, the capacity was expanded and the quality improved, the production of multicolour printed stamps was started. In the 1960 the company began to print export stamps as well.|$|R
2500|$|Chaloner's next {{target was}} the Bank of England which started trading in 1694. New £100 'bank notes' were {{introduced}} in June 1695, and to prevent forgery they were printed on official marbled paper. Chaloner had large stocks of forged blank paper delivered to his Knightsbridge home, and began producing his own new £100 bank-notes. Surprisingly, this did not become a felony until 1697. The first forgery was detected on 14 August 1695, within two months of their introduction. The forged paper was eventually traced to the printer who informed on Chaloner. Chaloner immediately turned [...] "King's evidence", surrendered his stock of unused paper, named other conspirators to give him credibility, and exposed a major fraud against the bank (one presumably {{in which he was}} himself involved). He testified that <b>blank</b> <b>bills</b> on the [...] "City orphans' fund" [...] were cut from the cheque book in the [...] "Chamber of London" [...] by Aubrey Price and the bank paid out amounts up to £1,000. For his 'efforts' Chaloner received formal thanks from the Bank of England, received a reward of £200 from the bank, and kept all of his profits from the counterfeiting.|$|R
5000|$|Using a {{slightly}} dampened piece of starched cloth {{she was able}} to lift ink from a genuine bill. With a hot iron, she transferred a pattern from the cloth to a <b>blank</b> paper <b>bill,</b> then inked the pattern by hand with quill pens. The original cotton cloth was easily disposed of through burning, leaving no hard evidence of a crime. Butterworth allegedly organized her counterfeiting operation into a cottage industry, sternly overseeing the work of the entire family. At the height of her operation, she was reportedly selling counterfeit bills at half their face value.|$|R
5000|$|According to Goodspeed's History of Lincoln County, Missouri (1888), Lincoln County {{was named}} by Major Christopher Clark, the first {{permanent}} white settler, when {{he addressed the}} Territorial Legislature saying, [...] "I was born, sir, in Link-Horn County, N.C., I lived {{for many years in}} Link-Horn County in old Kain-tuck. I wish to die in Link-Horn County, in Missouri; and I move, therefore, that the <b>blank</b> in the <b>bill</b> be filled with the name Link-Horn." [...] The motion was carried unanimously and the clerk, not adopting the frontier parlance of the Major, wrote [...] "Lincoln" [...] in the blank space of the bill. Others say it was named for Major General Benjamin Lincoln who served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.|$|R
60|$|In a village, every clerk, every tradesman, has {{something}} of the same distinctive importance as the doctors, the lawyers, the ministers. It really makes a difference to you when Jim Smith changes from Brown's grocery to Robinson's, because Jim knows what kind of sugar-corn you like, and your second cousin married Jim's best friend. <b>Bill</b> <b>Blank,</b> the tailor, {{is not just a}} mysterious agent who produces your clothes, but a real personality, whose wife's bonnet is worth your study, even though you are the wife of the mayor. So to every person in Lipsittsville Mr. Seth Appleby was not just a lowly person on a stool who helped one in the choice of shoes. He was a person, he was their brother, to be loved or hated. If he had gone out of the shoe business there would have been something else for him to do--he would have sold farm machinery or driven on a rural mail route or collected rents, and have kept the same acquaintances.|$|R
