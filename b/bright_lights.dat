5|$|In 1980, {{his team}} at NIMH {{admitted}} {{a patient with}} depression who had observed seasonal changes within himself and thought previous research regarding melatonin release at night {{may be able to}} help him. Rosenthal and his colleagues treated the patient with <b>bright</b> <b>lights,</b> which helped to successfully manage the depression. They conducted a formal follow-up study to confirm the success. The results were published in 1984, officially describing SAD and pioneering light therapy as an effective treatment method. The research on SAD and light therapy is inconclusive and in some ways controversial, as not all researchers agree with Rosenthal's conclusions on the effect of light therapy and at what time of day the light should be administered.|$|E
30|$|For <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> {{therapy to}} be {{effective}} in entraining circadian rhythm, it {{does not need to be}} continuous; in fact, exposure to three consecutive <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> ‘pulses’ for just 15  min can be more effective than continuous <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> [10]. This may also be more practical for use on ICU. Interestingly, despite the fact that many patients on ICU have their eyes closed, it is well recognised that <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> can entrain circadian rhythm through non-visual pathways via the retina [4].|$|R
40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} shown in animal studies that {{exposure}} to brief pulses of <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> can phase shift the circadian pacemaker and that the resetting action of light is most efficient during the first minutes of light exposure. In humans, multiple consecutive days of exposure to brief <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> pulses have been shown to phase shift the circadian pacemaker. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine whether a single sequence of brief <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> pulses administered during the early biological night would phase delay the human circadian pacemaker. Twenty-one healthy young subjects underwent a 6. 5 -h light exposure session in one of three randomly assigned conditions: 1) continuous <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> of approximately 9, 500 lux, 2) intermittent <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> (six 15 -min <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> pulses of approximately 9, 500 lux separated by 60 min of very dim light of < 1 lux), and 3) continuous very dim light of < 1 lux. Twenty subjects were included in the analysis. Core body temperature (CBT) and melatonin were used as phase markers of the circadian pacemaker. Phase delays of CBT and melatonin rhythms in response to intermittent <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> pulses were comparable to those measured after continuous <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> exposure, even though the total exposure to the intermittent <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> represented only 23 % of the 6. 5 -h continuous exposure. These results demonstrate that a single sequence of intermittent <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> pulses can phase delay the human circadian pacemaker and show that intermittent pulses have a greater resetting efficacy on a per minute basis than does continuous exposure...|$|R
50|$|The light-dark {{cycle is}} the most {{important}} environmental time cue for entraining circadian rhythms of most species, including humans, and <b>bright</b> artificial <b>light</b> exposure has been developed as a method to improve circadian adaptation in night workers. The timing of <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> exposure is critical for its phase shifting effects. To maximize a delay of the body clock, <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> exposure should occur in the evening or first part of the night, and <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> should be avoided in the morning. Wearing dark goggles (avoiding <b>bright</b> <b>light)</b> or blue-blocking goggles during the morning commute home from work can improve circadian adaptation. For workers who want to use <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> therapy, appropriate fixtures of the type used to treat winter depression are readily available but patients need to be educated regarding their appropriate use, especially the issue of timing. <b>Bright</b> <b>light</b> treatment is not recommended for patients with light sensitivity or ocular disease.|$|R

Irish ships sailed unarmed and usually alone, identifying themselves as neutrals with <b>bright</b> <b>lights</b> and by painting the Irish tricolour and EIRE in large letters on their sides and decks. Nonetheless twenty percent of seamen serving in Irish ships perished, victims of a war not their own: attacked by both sides, though predominantly by the Axis powers. Often, Allied convoys could not stop to pick up survivors, while Irish ships always answered SOS signals and stopped to rescue survivors, irrespective of which side they belonged to. Irish ships rescued 534 seamen.|$|E

Roy becomes fascinated by UFOs, much to the dismay of his wife, Ronnie. He also becomes increasingly obsessed with subliminal, mental images of a mountain-like shape and begins to make models of it. Jillian also becomes obsessed with sketching a unique-looking mountain. Soon after, she is terrorized in her home by a UFO which descends from the clouds. The presence of the UFO energy field makes every appliance in Jillian's house malfunction and Barry is abducted by unseen beings.|$|E
5|$|Thoughts {{of a new}} way {{to improve}} the {{nighttime}} environment began in summer 2011 when the new Cedar Fair CEO, Matt Ouimet was in the park one night and thought they should add more lights and excitement. The goal was to create a new show that would energize the main midway with <b>bright</b> <b>lights</b> and music. Matt Ouimet first mentioned the show at a conference in January 2012. Details of Luminosity were first announced at the PointBuzz winter tour of Cedar Point on February 25, 2012. The 3,600 square foot screen used for American Portrait and Hot Summer Lights was taken down on February 28 because it was not needed for the new show. On April 13, Cedar Point officially announced Luminosity. The show debuted on June 1 for previews and its grand opening was held on June 8.|$|E
5|$|In the Spanish {{armament}} of 1790, Seymour {{was called}} to service {{in command of the}} ship of the line HMS Canada, opening his commission with a cruise off the Isle of Wight. Passing through shallow water, Seymour ordered the use of a lead line to measure the depth ahead, but was accidentally struck in the head by the lead weight while soundings were being taken. Although little immediate damage seemed to have been caused, during the firing of a salute several days later Seymour suddenly suffered a severely adverse reaction and had to be taken ashore for emergency medical treatment. The head injury rendered him unable to endure any loud noises or <b>bright</b> <b>lights</b> and {{for the next three years}} he lived as an invalid at his country estate in Hambleton. By 1793 he was sufficiently recovered to return to service, and escorted Lord Hood to the Mediterranean in HMS Leviathan. There Hood led the occupation, defence and ultimate withdrawal from Toulon during the Republican siege of the city. Following the collapse of the city's defences, Seymour was sent back to England with dispatches but returned shortly afterward to convoy Leviathan back to Britain.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: <b>Bright</b> <b>light</b> {{has been}} shown a {{powerful}} inhibitor of myopia development in animal models. We studied which temporal patterns of <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> are the most potent in suppressing deprivation myopia in chickens. METHODS: Eight-day-old chickens wore diffusers over one eye to induce deprivation myopia. A reference group (n = 8) was kept under office-like illuminance (500 lux) at a 10 : 14 light:dark cycle. Episodes of <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> (15 000 lux) were super-imposed on this background as follows. Paradigm I: exposure to constant <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> for either 1 hour (n = 5), 2 hours (n = 5), 5 hours (n = 4) or 10 hours (n = 4). Paradigm II: exposure to repeated cycles of <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> with 50 % duty cycle and either 60 minutes (n = 7), 30 minutes (n = 8), 15 minutes (n = 6), 7 minutes (n = 7) or 1 minute (n = 7) periods, provided for 10 hours. Refraction and axial length were measured prior to and immediately after the 5 -day experiment. Relative changes were analyzed by paired t-tests, and differences among groups were tested by one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: Compared with the reference group, exposure to continuous <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> for 1 or 2 hours every day had no significant protective effect against deprivation myopia. Inhibition of myopia became significant after 5 hours of <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> exposure but extending the duration to 10 hours did not offer an additional benefit. In comparison, repeated cycles of 1 : 1 or 7 : 7 minutes of <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> enhanced the protective effect against myopia and could fully suppress its development. CONCLUSIONS: The protective effect of <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> depends on the exposure duration and, to the intermittent form, the frequency cycle. Compared to the saturation effect of continuous <b>bright</b> <b>light,</b> low frequency cycles of <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> (1 : 1 min) provided the strongest inhibition effect. However, our quantitative results probably might not be directly translated into humans, but rather need further amendments in clinical studies...|$|R
