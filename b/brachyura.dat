5|$|The {{wide variety}} of birds in Basse Casamance was noted by early explorers. While Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have not been open for years due to the Casamance Conflict, Carabane {{has been found to}} be very conducive to ornithological observation. A study in 1998 {{discovered}} the following species on the island: African darter (Anhinga rufa), Goliath heron (Ardea goliath), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), blue-spotted wood-dove (Turtur afer), red-eyed dove (Streptopelia semitorquata), white-rumped swift (Apus caffer), woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis), grey-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera <b>brachyura),</b> red-bellied paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone rufiventer), pied crow (Corvus albus), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytres) and yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus).|$|E
25|$|Hermit crabs {{are more}} closely related to squat {{lobsters}} and porcelain crabs than they are to true crabs (<b>Brachyura).</b> However, the relationship of king crabs to the rest of Paguroidea is a highly contentious topic. Many studies based on physical characteristics, genetic information, and combined data, support the longstanding hypothesis that the king crabs in the family Lithodidae are derived hermit crabs and should be classified as a family within Paguroidea. Other researchers have challenged this, asserting that the Lithodidae (king crabs) should be placed with the Hapalogastridae in a separate superfamily Lithodoidea. Six families are formally recognized in the superfamily Paguroidea, containing around 1100 species in total in 120 genera.|$|E
2500|$|Trumpeter whiting are benthic {{carnivores}} {{during their}} adult life, and like other sillaginids undergo {{a change in}} diet as they grow older. Juveniles are often considered to not be benthic, as they feed {{on a variety of}} planktonic prey, with [...] mysids, amphipods and rarely polychaetes the main prey. They also prey on a variety of meiobenthos, with copepods the predominant form taken. Once they reach over 10cm in size, they move into deeper water where they prey predominantly on polychaetes, bivalves, ophiuroidea and <b>brachyura.</b>|$|E
60|$|Once more, the {{prevalence}} of Macrurous before Brachyurous Podophthalmia is, apparently, a fair piece of evidence in favour of progressive modification {{in the same order}} of Crustacea; and yet the case will not stand much sifting, seeing that the Macrurous Podophthalmia depart as far in one direction from the common type of Podophthalmia, or from any embryonic condition of the <b>Brachyura,</b> as the <b>Brachyura</b> do in the other; and that the middle terms between Macrura and Brachyura--the Anomura--are little better represented in the older Mesozoic rocks than the <b>Brachyura</b> are.|$|E
60|$|The ANNULOSA.--The Carboniferous Insecta and Arachnida {{are neither}} less specialised, nor more embryonic, than these that now live, nor are the Liassic Cirripedia and Macrura; while {{several of the}} <b>Brachyura,</b> which appear in the Chalk, belong to {{existing}} genera; and none exhibit either an intermediate, or an embryonic, character.|$|E
60|$|It is {{not known}} that male {{crustaceans}} fight together for the possession of the females, but this is probable; for with most animals when the male {{is larger than the}} female, he seems to have acquired his greater size by having conquered during many generations other males. Now Mr. Spence Bate informs me that in most of the crustacean orders, especially in the highest or the <b>Brachyura,</b> the male is larger than the female; the parasitic genera, however, in which the sexes follow different habits of life, and most of the Entomostraca must be excepted. The chelæ of many crustaceans are weapons well adapted for fighting. Thus a Devil-crab (Portunus puber) was seen by a son of Mr. Bate fighting with a Carcinus mænas, and the latter was soon thrown on its back, and had every limb torn from its body. When several males of a Brazilian Gelasimus, a species furnished with immense pincers, were placed together by Fritz Müller in a glass vessel, they mutilated and killed each other. Mr. Bate put a large male Carcinus mænas into a pan of water, inhabited by a female paired with a smaller male; the latter was soon dispossessed, but, as Mr. Bate adds, “if they fought, the victory was a bloodless one, for I saw no wounds.” This same naturalist separated a male sand-skipper (so common on our sea-shores), Gammarus marinus, from its female, both of which were imprisoned in the same vessel with many individuals of the same species. The female being thus divorced joined her comrades. After an interval the male was again put into the same vessel and he then, after swimming about for a time, dashed into the crowd, and without any fighting at once took away his wife. This fact shews that in the Amphipoda, an order low in the scale, the males and females recognise each other, and are mutually attached.|$|E
