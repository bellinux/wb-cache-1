At the ultrastructural level, the proximal convoluted tubules of black mice contained two morphologic types of heterophagosomes, which apparently differed in accord with the stage of their development.

KEY WORDS GERL <b>beige</b> <b>mouse</b> alveolar macrophage lysosomes. endocytosis GERL (Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes) is a term used to describe a hydrolaserich structure located near the "trans " (3) Golgi saccule. It {{is considered to be}} a specialized area of endoplasmic reticulum that is apparently involved in the formation of various types of lysosomes (16, 18, 19). The structure was first described by Novikoff (16) in the small neurons of rat dorsal root ganglia. Novikoff and his colleagues subsequently described GERL in diverse cell types (see reference 18, for recent review). In a preliminary study of mouse alveolar macrophages (4), we described a system of smoothsurfaced elements that appeared to be analogous to GERL. This report provides additional morphological and cytochemical evidence for the presence of GERL in the alveolar macrophage. Although GERL has also been identified in alveolar macrophages of normal Swiss mice, it is more highly developed and thus easier to study in the <b>beige</b> <b>mouse,</b> a mutant considered to be homologous to human Chediak-Higashi syndrome (1, 13, 20). Recently, Gonatas et al. (8) demonstrated that when cultured neurons are exposed to conjugates of ricin or phytohemagglutinin and horseradish peroxidase, the material is endocytosed into GERL. In the present study, we show that when colloidal silver is endocytosed by alveolar macrophages, it first appears in pinocytic vacuoles and then in elements of GERL.

40|$|Kidney {{beta-glucuronidase}} turnover {{has been}} examined by specific antibody methods in normal C 57 BL/ 6 J mice and in coisogenic C 57 BL/ 6 J <b>beige</b> <b>mice,</b> an animal {{model for the}} human Ch√©diak-Higashi syndrome. No effect of the beige gene on the rate of glucuronidase synthesis was detected in either untreated or testosterone-treated mice. Moreover, glucuronidase of <b>beige</b> <b>mice</b> decayed relatively slowly in pulse labeling and in hormone withdrawal experiments. Direct measurements of secretion confirmed that both {{in the presence of}} testosterone and following its withdrawal, there was a threefold lower rate of secretion of kidney glucuronidase in <b>beige</b> <b>mice.</b> Following hormone withdrawal, the loss of glucuronidase activity in <b>beige</b> <b>mice</b> was biphasic, with the second more slowly turning over component apparently lost by a nonsecretory mechanism. This persistent nonsecreted glucuronidase activity was specifically associated with giant lysosomes in kidney proximal tubule cells near the corticomedullary border. Thus, there are two major populations of lysosomes in proximal tubule cells of <b>beige</b> <b>mice.</b> Cells of the outer cortex contain mainly morphologically normal lysosomes, and their lysosomal enzymes are secreted at near normal rates. However, lysosomal enzymes derived from the giant lysosomes of cells near the corticomedullary border are secreted either very slowly or not at all.

Overall, macrophages from all strains of mice tested {{not only were}} able to migrate into the peritoneal cavity in response to several eliciting agents but showed a comparable capacity to phagocytize fluorescein isothiocyanate-Iabeled, heat-killed Candida albicans. However, some populations of peritoneal exudate macrophages from homozygous <b>beige</b> <b>mice</b> (e. g., thioglycollate-elicited) and resident peritoneal macrophages from bgfbg mice incubated in vitro with supernatants from concanavalin A-stimulated spleno-cytes had poorer candidacidal activity than did control macrophages from bgj+ mice.

In vitro testing permits measurements of minimal inhibi-tory and minimal bactericidal concentrations, identification of the synergism or antagonism of various agents, definition of an agent's pharmacokinetic properties (e. g., hydrophilicity or lipo-philicity), and evaluation of a drug's intracellular penetration and activity against intracellular organisms.

40|$|The <b>beige</b> <b>mouse</b> is {{considered}} to be a homologue of Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS). Cytochemical and electron microscopic studies have revealed an inherited lesion in the kidneys of these mice. The alteration was confined to the distal segments (S 3) of the proximal tubules and was characterized by the accumulation of numerous massive polysaccharide-rich granules. These granules were reactive for acid phosphatase and Œ≤-glucuronidase activities and were therefore considered to be lysosomes. Small numbers of lymphocytes were also observed in the perivascular spaces and within the tubules of the S 3 segment. The fine structure of S 3 cells was also markedly altered. In addition to the massive lysosomes, dense material was found associated with the brush border and was present in pinocytotic vesicles at the base of the brush border and between basal invaginations of the plasma membranes. Despite these changes, reabsorption of exogeneous peroxidase by S 3 cells appeared to be normal.

40|$|The beige {{mutation}} in C 57 BL/ 6 mice {{has been shown}} to increase the susceptibility to infection by Mycobacterium avium. In this study, we confirmed those results and showed that the effect of the beige mutation was most obvious after infection with a strain of lower virulence than with a highly virulent isolate of M. avium. The dissemination of M. avium from the gut was observed with both C 57 BL/ 6 and <b>beige</b> <b>mice</b> but was faster in the latter. The expression of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and the priming for tumor necrosis factor production during an in vivo infection were similar between beige and immunocompetent C 57 BL/ 6 mice. IFN-gamma produced during the infection of <b>beige</b> <b>mice</b> was protective in the spleen, and the administration of recombinant IFN-gamma restored the resistance in the spleen to levels similar to those found in control mice. There were no histological differences between wild-type and <b>beige</b> <b>mice</b> with respect to granuloma formation in the liver. The increased susceptibility of <b>beige</b> <b>mice</b> to M. avium as manifested in the liver was reduced by transfusing neutrophils from wild-type C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Likewise, depletion of neutrophils from C 57 BL/ 6 mice rendered them as susceptible to M. avium infection of the liver as <b>beige</b> <b>mice.</b> Our results point to the participation of neutrophils in the defect of <b>beige</b> <b>mice</b> in addition to other defects.

40|$|Lymphocytes {{from natural}} killer (NK) cell-deficient <b>beige</b> <b>mice</b> have a poor ability to induce many {{different}} forms of graft-versus-host reaction (GvHR). In this study, we have examined whether this defect could reflect an associated abnormality in beige T-lymphocyte function. Compared with normal, congenic C 57 Bl/ 6 (B 6) <b>mice,</b> <b>beige</b> <b>mice</b> had similar numbers and proportions of T-cell subsets and generated normal allospecific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses in vivo.

Beige lymphocytes recirculated normally in vivo and showed enhanced proliferative responses to mitogens and alloantigens in vitro. In contrast, beige responder cells generated poor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses in vitro and had quantitatively identical defects in CTL and NK cell activation after alloimmunization in vivo. These results suggest that although many effector and regulatory T-cell functions are normal in <b>beige</b> <b>mice,</b> the NK-cell defect in these animals is paralleled by impaired CTL activity.

40|$|The <b>beige</b> <b>mouse</b> is {{currently}} {{used as a}} model of elastase and cathepsin G deficiency to demonstrate or exclude the role of these proteases in a variety of pathologic conditions. We recently demonstrated that beige cathepsin G is tightly bound to neutrophil lysosomal membranes but is released in near normal quantities during exocytosis. Also, beige neutrophils contain a latent form of elastase that undergoes spontaneous activation when released under in vitro or in vivo conditions. However, the pathogenic potential of this enzyme in matrix degradation has not been ascertained previously. The possibility that in beige mice elastolytic proteases from neutrophils recruited into the lung have the capability to damage alveolar septa was investigated following an intratracheal instillation of N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (200 microg). Neutrophil influx was followed by a decrease in lung elastin content (- 18 %) and by a significant increase of the mean linear intercept (+ 30 %) and of morphologic emphysema. The onset of pulmonary lesion was preceded by a marked increase of neutrophil elastase burden on the alveolar interstitium. The appearance of emphysema was prevented by administration of the serine protease inhibitor 4 -(2 -aminoetyl) -benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (2. 4 microg/ml saline). These results demonstrate that the lung elastin degradation and emphysema can occur in beige lungs.

Treatment with rifabutin at 10, 20, or 40 mg/kg {{of body weight}} was started 7 days postinfection and was administered daily for 10 days. The mice were sacrificed 3 to 5 days after the last dose. Spleens, livers, and lungs were homogenized, and viable cell counts were determined by serial dilution and plating onto Middlebrook 7 H 10 agar. A dose-related reduction in MAC cell counts in the organs was noted for this MAC isolate. The comparative activities of rifabutin and rifapentine were determined against {{a total of five}} MAC isolates in the <b>beige</b> <b>mouse</b> model.

For these two MAC isolates, rifabutin was more active than rifapentine. These agents had activities in the lungs against three of five isolates.

40|$|Among other {{phenotypic}} defects, the <b>beige</b> <b>mouse</b> is {{susceptible to}} infection and has large neutrophil granules that apparently secrete a decreased amount of elastolytic activity. We have shown using in vitro methods that cytosolic inhibitors in beige neutrophils are normal. Although cathepsin G is tightly bound to lysosomal membranes, normal amounts of activity are released in response to degranulating agents. Decreased elastolytic activity is secreted by beige neutrophils because elastase {{is present in the}} granules as a 46 kDa proenzyme, which can be activated extracellularly by a protease-dependent mechanism. The current experiments were undertaken to explore the in vivo functions of neutrophils from C 57 BI/ 6 J (bg/bg) beige mice using the model of casein-induced acute peritonitis; normal C 57 BI/ 6 J (+/+) mice served as controls. The kinetics of neutrophil accumulation in the peritoneum were normal, suggesting normal neutrophil migration. Cathepsin G activity in the cell-free supernatant of peritoneal lavage fluid was normal; elastolytic activity was initially very low but increased to about twice baseline level after 4 h at 25 degrees C and to about 20 -fold at 36 h. The appearance of this activity was inhibited to varying degree (54 to 83 %) by different protease inhibitors (pepstatin, antipain, aprotinin, leupeptin and chymostatin). We conclude that the decreased amount of elastolytic activity secreted by beige neutrophils into an inflammatory exudate is due to a genetic defect that results in production of a 46 kDa proelastase rather than the normal 29 kDa active elastase; the proelastase can be spontaneously activated by a protease-dependent mechanism. In light of these data, the use of the <b>beige</b> <b>mouse</b> {{as a model for the}} Chediak-Higashi syndrome, and as a model in which neutrophils do not produce elastase, must be reconsidered...|$|E

Clarithromycin both treats and prevents MAC disease in <b>beige</b> <b>mice.</b> Dapsone has no therapeutic effect, but it does have a slight prophylactic effect, and in combination with clarithromycin it does not abrogate the effect of clarithromycin...|$|R

These methods reveal granule secretion in response to the degranulating agents in mast cells of both normal and <b>beige</b> <b>mice.</b> The observations indicate that beige peritoneal mast cells retain the capacity to exocytose their granules upon stimulation and suggest that the defect underlying the formation of the mega-inclusions is not attributable to impaired degranulation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract <b>Beige</b> <b>mice</b> {{express the}} Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Large inclusions, {{identified}} as abnormal lysosomes, {{are found in}} many cells. The inclusions in type I 1 alveolar epithelial cells are enlarged lamellar bodies and they are associated {{with an increase in}} total lung surface-active material and phospholipid. Comparison of recovery of phospholipid in surface-active materials from beige and black (normal) mice indicates that in the <b>beige</b> <b>mice</b> there is an increase in total phospholipid and disaturated phosphatidylcholines in whole lung and in surface-active materials in residual lung after lavage. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol are increased as percentages of total lung phospholipid. Calculated alveolar surface coverage of surface-active materials isolated from residual beige lungs is greater than three times that of normal lungs...|$|R
40|$|The <b>beige</b> <b>mouse</b> is a homolog of Chediak-Higashi syndrome, a {{disorder}} which {{is characterized by}} the presence of enlarged (anomalous) lysosomes in many cell types. In kidney, anomalous lysosomes are present in cells of the proximal convoluted tubules. In this study, the degradation of injected horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in lysosomes was studied in both the convoluted (S 1 -S 2) and straight (S 3) segments of the proximal tubules of beige and control (C 57 B 1) mice. Tissues were removed at intervals from 18 hours to 7 days after HRP injection. Peroxidase activity was visualized for light and electron microscopy by incubating sections in diaminobenzidine medium. No differences in the rate of degradation of HRP were demonstrable between anomalous lysosomes in S 1 -S 2 cells of beige kidney and those in controls. In both animals, HRP was demonstrable in these lysosomes at 18 and 36 hours but not at 48 hours after injection. By electron microscopy, reaction product appeared as a flocculent precipitate distributed uniformly throughout the lysosome. In contrast to those of S 1 -S 2 cells, lysosomes of beige S 3 cells degraded HRP much more slowly than did those of control mice. In controls, HRP was demonstrable in S 3 lysosomes at 18 hours but not at 48 hours after injection. In <b>beige</b> <b>mouse</b> kidney HRP was demonstrable in many S 3 lysosomes at 48 hours, and it persisted in some lysosomes as long as 5 days after injection. These findings indicate that beige S 3 lysosomes are defective in degrading protein. As reported recently, these lysosomes are also markedly enlarged and altered in content. They appear to arise as part of a renal lesion of unknown pathogenesis which is confined to the S 3 segments of the proximal tubules. The slower rate of degradation of protein appears to be another manifestation of the alteration in these lysosomes...|$|E
40|$|Calcium is mobilized from {{intracellular}} stores during phagocyte activation {{and appears}} to be Involved in stimulus-response coupling in these and other cell types. Because the iysosome Is a calcium-sequestering organelle In the neutrophil and abnormal lysosome morphology Is associated with defective neutrophil function in Chedlak-Higashl syn-drome (CHS), we examined ATP-dependent calcium uptake in neutrophil lysosomes from the <b>beige</b> <b>mouse</b> model of CHS. We present findings Indicating that CHS lysosomes have an enhanced capacity for ATP-dependent calcium uptake relative to control iyso-somes. Kinetic analysis showed differences in Vm. x and in the Km for both ATP and calcium, suggesting that both the number of lysosomal calcium uptake pumps and their substrate affinity may be altered in CHS. We conclude that a genetically determined abnormality of a subcellular calcium transport system may contribute to the structural and functional defects of CHS cells.

40|$|AbstractExocytosis {{begins with}} {{formation}} of a small fusion pore which then expands allowing rapid release of granular contents. We studied the influence of cytoplasmic free Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i) on the conductance of the initial pore and on the dynamics of subsequent expansion in horse eosinophils using the patch clamp technique. The mean initial conductance is ‚àº 200 pS independent of [Ca 2 +]i. This value is close to that previously found in <b>beige</b> <b>mouse</b> mast cells. The pore subsequently expands by 18 nS/s at [Ca 2 +]i < 10 nM, by 40 nS/s at [Ca 2 +]i = 1. 5 ŒºM and by 90 nS/s at [Ca 2 +]i = 10 ŒºM. These {{results show that the}} structure of the initial fusion pore is independent of cytoplasmic Ca 2 +. However, the pore expansion is a Ca 2 +-dependent process modulating secretion at a step later than vesicle-plasma membrane fusion...|$|E
40|$|Antiglomerular {{basement}} membrane (GBM) nephritis with massive albuminuria can be induced in mice by injection of heterologous antibodies against mouse GBM. The albuminuria and the glomerular lesions {{in this model}} are not mediated by complement, but are dependent {{on the presence of}} polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN) in the glomeruli. Neutral serine proteinases and reactive oxygen metabolites produced by activated PMN have been implicated as agents contributing to tissue damage. We examined the role of leukocytic neutral proteinases by comparing the glomerular damage and albuminuria after injection of rabbit anti-mouse GBM antibodies in normal control mice (C 57 BL/ 6 J, +/+) and in <b>beige</b> <b>mice</b> (C 57 BL/ 6 J,bg/bg) in which PMN are deficient of the neutral proteinases elastase and cathepsin G. The dose- dependent albuminuria that occurred in control mice after injection of 1. 4 - 22 mg of anti-GBM antibodies was not observed in <b>beige</b> <b>mice,</b> despite a comparable influx of PMNs in the glomeruli. By electron microscopy both strains showed a similar attachment of PMN to the denuded GBM together with swelling and necrosis of endothelial cells. Elastase activity of extracts from PMN of <b>beige</b> <b>mice</b> was only 10 - 15 % of the activity of control mice. In vitro, GBM degradation by PMN extracts of <b>beige</b> <b>mice</b> was 70 % lower than that seen in control experiments. PMNs of <b>beige</b> and control <b>mice</b> showed no differences in superoxide production. In addition, administration of scavengers of reactive oxygen metabolites, such as catalase and desferrioxamine, did not prevent the albuminuria in this model. These findings support the important contribution of leukocytic neutral proteinases to the induction of albuminuria in the acute phase of anti-GBM nephritis in the mouse...|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} {{experimental}} setup, we investigated the functional outcome following a severe ischemia time of 40 min. In scid <b>beige</b> <b>mice,</b> this extent of injury {{resulted in a}} comparatively moderate reduction of renal function. In immunocompetent wild-type mice, a much more pronounced decrease in kidney function would be expected with a histologically distinct post-ischemic inflammation [15]. Histological findings in kidneys of scid <b>beige</b> <b>mice</b> {{were in accordance with}} the functional data. Tubules of ischemic kidneys only exhibited mild structural changes as signs of hypoxia without any evidence for severe damage. The absence of inflammatory infiltration in our model represents a feature of immunodeficient mice, supporting the notion of a severe ischemia-little injury model, and thus, the high reliability and sensitivity of the presented technique.|$|R
