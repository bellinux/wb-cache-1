30|$|Cameroon’s geology has {{revealed}} {{that the country has}} many sedimentary <b>basins</b> belonging to the active petroleum system in Central Africa (Abolo 2008). These <b>basins</b> are subdivided into two categories; coastal <b>basins</b> which include: Rio Del Rey (RDR) and Douala/Kribi Campo (DKC) Basins; and the intra-continental <b>basins</b> which include: the Mamfe and the Logon Birni <b>Basins.</b> The coastal <b>basins</b> are known to host hydrocarbons, and no petroleum is known to occur in the inland <b>basins</b> so far. Taking this into account, the government of Cameroon has decided to subdivide these <b>basins</b> into blocks or concessions to put them at the disposal of the private petroleum companies. Presently, the Cameroon mining domain has about thirty concessions mainly located in the RDR and Douala <b>Basins</b> which are managed by the National Hydrocarbons Cooperation (NHC).|$|R

40|$|Abstract Rainfall and runoff depths were {{examined}} for 763 storms on 26 urban <b>basins</b> located in 12 countries. For 17 of the <b>basins,</b> impervious surfaces were the major contributors to storm runoff. These <b>basins</b> were generally smaller than 25 ha and had small to medium storms {{in the data}} set. Nine <b>basins</b> had significant amounts of runoff from pervious as well as impervious surfaces. Eight of these <b>basins</b> are located in Australia. For all 26 <b>basins,</b> plots of rainfall and runoff depths were used to estimate the effective impervious area and the impervious area initial loss. The data plotted close to a single straight line on all <b>basins,</b> indicating that the effective impervious area remained constant for all storm sizes. The effective impervious fraction was related to total impervious area and the directly connected impervious fraction estimated from maps. For the <b>basins</b> with pervious runoff, the depth of rain in the storm {{was the most important}} factor in determining pervious runoff for rainfalls less than 50 mm, while for larger storms other factors including rainfall intensit...|$|R

40|$|The {{recently}} released gravity potential field development {{derived from the}} Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite allows an unprecedented opportunity to use the gravity field to make global comparisons of structures of geological interest. The spatial resolution of the gravity field is sufficiently good to map large-scale or intracratonic and cratonic <b>basins,</b> as the areal extent of these <b>basins</b> is 0. 5 × 106 km 2 and greater. We present the gravity anomaly, Bouguer, geoid and terrain corrected geoid fields for a selection of nine large-scale <b>basins</b> and show that the satellite-derived field {{can be used to}} successfully identify distinctive structures of these <b>basins,</b> e. g., extinct rifts underlying the <b>basins</b> and generally the isostatic state. The studied <b>basins</b> are the Eastern Barents Sea, West Siberian, Tarim, Congo, Michigan, Amazon, Solim ˜ oes, Parnaiba and Paran`a <b>basins.</b> We complete the mapping of the gravity field with a description of the <b>basins</b> in terms of areal extension and depth, sedimentary age and presence and age of volcanism. Interpretation of the satellite gravity anomalies and considerations regarding the crustal thickness as known from seismic investigations, allows us to conclude that for the greater part of the <b>basins</b> there is evidence for high-density material in the lower crust and/or upper mantle. This density anomaly is, at least partly, compensating for the low-density sedimentary infill instead of the crustal thinning mechanism. For our selection of <b>basins,</b> crustal thickness variations and Moho topography cannot be considered as mechanisms of compensation of the sedimentary loading, which is a clear difference to well-defined rift <b>basins...</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the 11named storms, there were two additional storms in the season, classified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC).

The other formed just southeast of Diego Garcia on November20. It tracked to the southwest, and the JTWC estimated peak 1minute sustained winds of 85km/h (50mph). The storm dissipated on November25 northeast of Mauritius. In addition, Cyclone Daryl, which formed in the Australian <b>basin</b> on March6, crossed into the south-west Indian Ocean on March16 as a weakening storm without being renamed.
