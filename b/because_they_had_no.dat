This would allow the country to begin competing at the Eurovision Song Contest for the first time, should they decide to join the EBU, a pre-requisite for entering the contest. Shortly after its foundation however, the broadcaster announced {{that they were not}} interested in joining the EBU or Eurovision at that time <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> budget for membership.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Wilfrid Laurier, the Northwest Territories seat of government was moved to Ottawa, Ontario, the capital of Canada. This change was made when Northwest Territories defaulted back to the 1870 constitutional status after Alberta and Saskatchewan were sectioned off from the territory on September 1, 1905. After the populated regions of the territory were made into their own jurisdictions, there were very few settlements left in the territory with any significant population or infrastructure. The non-Inuit population was estimated to total around 1,000. Inuit were not counted at the time <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> status under Canadian law, and were not yet settled in towns or villages.|$|E
5|$|On September 19, 2003, President George W. Bush {{declared}} {{the entire state}} of Maryland as a disaster area, which allowed residents affected by the hurricane to apply for federal aid. FEMA officials urged residents and business owners with significant damage to call as soon as possible, while those with minimal damage were asked to wait for a few days. All residents in the state who received damage from the storm had sixty days to apply for assistance. Federal and state officials opened disaster recovery centers in Annapolis, Baltimore, Essex, and Prince Frederick five days after the hurricane passed through the area, with the centers designed to provide more information to those who applied for federal assistance. About six days after Isabel made landfall, additional disaster recovery centers opened in Rock Hall in Kent County, California in Saint Mary's County, Silver Spring in Montgomery County, Chester in Queen Anne's County, Crisfield in Somerset County, Cambridge in Dorchester County, and Easton in Talbot County. Around a month after the hurricane, officials placed some residents unable to live in their damaged homes into travel trailers <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> options for alternate housing, such as staying with a relative or friend.|$|E

5|$|One {{particular}} aspect {{that led}} to disagreement amongst {{the cast and crew}} was the genuine killing of animals. Kerman stormed off the set while the death of the coatimundi was filmed, and Yorke refused to participate in the killing of a pig, which he was originally scripted to execute, leaving the duty to Luca Barbareschi. When it was shot, the squeal of the pig subsequently caused Yorke to botch a long monologue, and retakes were not an option <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> access to additional pigs. Perry Pirkanen cried after filming the butchering of a turtle, and crew members vomited off camera when a squirrel monkey was killed for the film. Actress Francesca Ciardi also objected to the film's sexual content {{and did not want to}} bare her breasts during the sex scene between her and Carl Yorke. When she refused to comply with Deodato's direction, he dragged her off the set and screamed at her in Italian. She had earlier suggested that she and Yorke actually have sex in the jungle before filming in order to relieve the tension of the upcoming scene. When Yorke declined, she grew upset with him, alienating him for the rest of the shoot.|$|E
25|$|In 1950 Boeing {{tentatively}} {{produced a}} specification for a jet airliner dubbed the Model 473-60C.

25|$|At the time, Finland had a {{fleet of}} six steam-powered icebreakers to keep trade routes open through the winter months. Following the {{commissioning}} of Jääkarhu in 1926, the Finnish Board of Navigation had planned to replace the smallest vessels of the state-owned fleet, the 1890-built Murtaja and the 1899-built Apu, with a new medium-sized icebreaker. These icebreakers represented {{the first generation of}} icebreaker design in the Baltic Sea and were considered obsolete <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> bow propeller. However, the plans were shelved due to the recession.|$|E
25|$|Significant {{quantities}} of rare-earth oxides {{are found in}} tailings accumulated from 50 years of uranium ore, shale and loparite mining at Sillamäe, Estonia. Due to the rising prices of rare earths, extraction of these oxides has become economically viable. The country currently exports around 3,000 tonnes per year, representing around 2% of world production.

25|$|During the battle, the Vietnamese fleet {{detected}} {{two more}} Chinese warships {{rushing to the}} area. China later acknowledged these were the Hainan-class submarine chasers #281 and #282. Despite South Vietnamese reports {{that at least one}} of their ships had been struck by a missile, the Chinese insisted what the Vietnamese saw were rocket-propelled grenades fired by the crew of #389 and that no missile-capable ships were present, and the Chinese ships closed in <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> missiles. The South Vietnamese fleet also received warnings that U.S. Navy radar had detected additional Chinese guided missile frigates and aircraft on their way from Hainan.|$|E
25|$|Born in Moseley, Birmingham, in 1897 to Mr. and Mrs. Hugh Lewis, he {{was educated}} at Marlborough College. He {{volunteered for the}} Northamptonshire Regiment for service early in World War I. On 10 September 1915, having trained at the Officers' Training Corps at the University of London, he was {{commissioned}} as a second lieutenant; however, he was not entitled to pay and allowances until the following 3 January. His first try at transferring to the Royal Flying Corps was refused <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> openings. Lewis then procured £100 from his father for tuition, and put himself through private pilot's training at Hendon on a Grahame-White Boxkite. Lewis was awarded Aviators' Certificate No. 2116 on 27 November 1915. The RFC then accepted him and {{sent him to the}} Central Flying School at Upavon.|$|E

25|$|In 132, the Emperor Hadrian {{threatened}} to rebuild Jerusalem as a pagan city dedicated to Jupiter, called Aelia Capitolina. Some {{of the leading}} sages of the Sanhedrin supported a rebellion (and, for a short time, an independent state) led by Simon bar Kochba; some, such as Rabbi Akiva, believed Bar Kochba to be messiah, or king. Up until this time, a number of Christians were still part of the Jewish community. However, they did not support or {{take part in the}} revolt. Whether <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> wish to fight, or because they could not support a second messiah in addition to Jesus, or because of their harsh treatment by Bar Kochba during his brief reign, these Christians also left the Jewish community around this time. Traditionally, it is believed the Jerusalem Christians waited out the Jewish–Roman wars in Pella in the Decapolis.|$|E
25|$|Platinum {{was first}} used for minting coins in Spanish-colonized America. Following the {{discovery}} of platinum in gold rocks, the Spaniards were unable {{to use it for}} a long time <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> technology for processing this metal. The then-cheap platinum was used for various kinds of frauds, such as substituting it for the more expensive silver. After the discovery that platinum alloys with gold, counterfeiters began to add it to gold coins. The platinum confiscated from counterfeiters was then thrown into the sea, in accordance with the royal decree of 1735. Later, the practice of adding platinum to gold as a ligature was adopted by the authorities in Spain in order to lower the gold content of coins. Also in Spain, in the mid-19th century, counterfeiters began producing British Sovereigns out of a gold-plated alloy of platinum and copper, relying on a similar specific weight of platinum and gold.|$|E

On 21 June 2011, after having been anchored off Muara Asam Asam in Kalimantan, Indonesia, for almost two months due to a commercial dispute on a quality of loaded nickel ore, seven crew members managed to purchase three litres of pure spirits from a ship chandler to have a party. Unbeknownst to them, the captain of the ship had asked the ship chandler to deliver ethanol for the ship's medical kit, but had rejected the suspicious-looking bottles <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> prints proving that the content was suitable for medical use. Instead of 90–95% ethanol spirit the liquid in the bottles contained 36% of methanol, and four of the seven crew members involved in the party {{died as a result of}} methanol poisoning.|$|E

25|$|In May 1506 Kemal Reis, {{commanding}} a {{force of}} 8 galliots and fustas, returned to the Aegean Sea, and in June 1506 landed at the Island of Leros with {{a force of}} 500 janissaries. There he assaulted the Venetian castle {{under the command of}} Paolo Simeoni. Throughout June 1506 he raided the Dodecanese Islands before sailing back to the West Mediterranean with a fleet of 22 ships (including 3 large galleys and 11 fustas) where he landed on Sicily and assaulted the coastal settlements. There he was confronted by the forces of the Viceroy of Sicily who was an ally of Spain. In September 1506 Kemal Reis confronted a Spanish fleet for defending Djerba and captured a Spanish galley during combat. In October 1506 he landed at Trapani in Sicily and burned the Genoese ships at the port, whose crewmen were however released <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> experience of naval warfare and were not deemed useful. He later bombarded the Venetian galley under the command of Benedetto Priuli. He responded to the cannon fire from the fortress of Trapani with the cannons on his ships. He later sailed to the Island of Cerigo in the Ionian Sea with a force of 3 galleys and 2 fustas, and exchanged fire with the Venetian fleet under the command of Girolamo Contarini. He later sailed back to Constantinople.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1850 {{there is}} no record of Wagner expressing any {{particular}} antisemitic sentiment. However, as he struggled to develop his career he began to resent the success of Jewish composers such as Felix Mendelssohn and Giacomo Meyerbeer and blamed them for his lack of success, particularly after his stay in Paris in 1840–41 when he was impoverished and reduced to music copy-editing. Ironically, at the same time Wagner did have considerable contact with Meyerbeer, who loaned him money, and used his influence to arrange for the premiere of Rienzi, Wagner's first successful opera, in Dresden in 1842; Meyerbeer later expressed hurt and bewilderment over Wagner's written abuse of him, his works, and his faith. Wagner's first and most controversial essay on the subject was Das Judenthum in der Musik ('Jewishness in Music'), originally published under the pen-name K. Freigedank (K. Freethought) in 1850 in the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik. In a previous issue Theodor Uhlig had attacked the success in Paris of Meyerbeer's Le prophète, and Wagner's essay expanded this to an attack on supposed 'Jewishness' in all German art. The essay purported to explain popular dislike of Jewish composers, in particular Mendelssohn and Meyerbeer, who is not mentioned by name but is clearly a target. Wagner wrote that the German people were repelled by Jews due to their 'alien' appearance and behaviour: 'with all our speaking and writing in favour of the Jews' emancipation, we always felt instinctively repelled by any actual, operative contact with them.' He argued that Jewish musicians were only capable of producing music that was shallow and artificial, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> connection to the genuine spirit of the German people.|$|E
500|$|Between 1737 and 1739, Johnson befriended poet Richard Savage. Feeling {{guilty about}} living on Tetty's money, Johnson stopped {{living with her}} and spent his time with Savage.

Savage's friends tried to help him by {{attempting}} {{to persuade him to}} move to Wales, but Savage ended up in Bristol and again fell into debt. He was committed to debtors' prison and died in 1743.
