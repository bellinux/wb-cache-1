5|$|Some {{people suffer}} from {{allergic}} reactions after handling onions. Symptoms can include contact dermatitis, intense itching, rhinoconjunctivitis, <b>blurred</b> <b>vision,</b> bronchial asthma, sweating, and anaphylaxis. Allergic reactions may not occur when eating cooked onions, possibly {{due to the}} denaturing of the proteins from cooking.|$|E
5|$|Three-quarters {{of people}} with LEMS also have {{disruption}} of the autonomic nervous system. This may be experienced as a dry mouth, constipation, <b>blurred</b> <b>vision,</b> impaired sweating, and orthostatic hypotension (falls in blood pressure on standing, potentially leading to blackouts). Some report a metallic taste in the mouth.|$|E
5|$|The major {{side effects}} include dilated pupils, <b>blurred</b> <b>vision,</b> dryness of the mouth, extreme alertness, pruritus, confusion, agitation, tremor, {{extrapyramidal}} symptoms (dystonia, akathisia), headache, dizziness, anxiety, insomnia, vomiting, chest pain, hallucinations, paresthesia, tachycardia, hypertension, palpitations, collapse, hyperventilation, sweating, hyperthermia and problems with urine retention. The more severe toxic effects include psychosis or adverse psychiatric events, renal toxicity, respiratory failure, hyperthermia, serotonin syndrome, rhabdomyolysis and seizure. Blood benzylpiperazine concentrations have been measured either to confirm clinical intoxication or {{as part of}} a medicolegal death investigation.|$|E
25|$|Some people {{develop a}} {{condition}} called macular edema. It {{occurs when the}} damaged blood vessels leak fluid and lipids onto the macula, {{the part of the}} retina that lets us see detail. The fluid makes the macula swell, which <b>blurs</b> <b>vision.</b>|$|R
50|$|Artificial tears {{usually are}} {{the first line of}} {{treatment}} for dry eyes. While mild cases require application of lubricant drops four times a day, severe cases require more aggressive treatment, such as ten to twelve times a day. Thicker artificial tears can be used in severe cases, although these may temporarily <b>blur</b> <b>vision.</b>|$|R
50|$|Patients {{are often}} {{asymptomatic}} {{in the initial}} stages of retinal perivasculitis. Some patients may develop symptoms such as floaters, <b>blurring</b> <b>vision,</b> or even gross diminution of vision due to massive vitreous hemorrhage. Vision in these patients can be normal to hand movements or light perception only. Bilaterality is quite common (50-90%) patients.|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} {{side-effects}} of benzodiazepines {{are related to}} their sedating and muscle-relaxing action. They include drowsiness, dizziness, and decreased alertness and concentration. Lack of coordination may result in falls and injuries, in particular, in the elderly. Another result is impairment of driving skills and increased likelihood of road traffic accidents. Decreased libido and erection problems are a common side effect. Depression and disinhibition may emerge. Hypotension and suppressed breathing (hypoventilation) may be encountered with intravenous use. Less common side effects include nausea and changes in appetite, <b>blurred</b> <b>vision,</b> confusion, euphoria, depersonalization and nightmares. Cases of liver toxicity have been described but are very rare.|$|E
5|$|In another case, 28-year-old British student Nathan Layton was {{bitten by}} a black mamba and {{died of a heart}} attack in less than an hour in March 2008. The black mamba had been found near a {{classroom}} at the Southern African Wildlife College in Hoedspruit, where Layton was training to be a safari guide. Layton was bitten by the snake on his index finger while it was being put into a jar, but he didn't realize he'd been bitten. He thought the snake had only brushed his hand. Approximately 30 minutes after being bitten Layton complained of <b>blurred</b> <b>vision.</b> He collapsed and {{died of a heart attack}}, nearly an hour after being bitten. Attempts to revive him failed, and he was pronounced dead at the scene.|$|E
5|$|A {{person with}} MS can have almost any {{neurological}} symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems {{being the most}} common. The specific symptoms {{are determined by the}} locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, <b>blurred</b> <b>vision,</b> very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties, among others. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff's phenomenon, a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte's sign, an electrical sensation that runs down the back when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS. The main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research.|$|E
50|$|The {{blood of}} dragons is {{poisonous}} to most other creatures, including humans. The poison consumes the victim with chills, <b>blurs</b> <b>vision,</b> makes {{him or her}} dizzy, and induces vomiting. This poison is very fast acting, {{but there is a}} cure {{in the form of a}} wafer and certain herbs, which needs to be consumed.|$|R
50|$|Clinical signs include redness of the eye, pain, <b>blurring</b> of <b>vision,</b> {{photophobia}} and floaters.|$|R
5000|$|... 8. Somatic (sensory): Tinnitus, <b>blurring</b> of <b>vision,</b> hot {{and cold}} flushes, {{feelings}} of weakness, pricking sensation.|$|R
5|$|Symptoms are {{dependent}} {{on the type of}} TBI (diffuse or focal) and {{the part of the brain}} that is affected. Unconsciousness tends to last longer for people with injuries on the left side of the brain than for those with injuries on the right. Symptoms are also dependent on the injury's severity. With mild TBI, the patient may remain conscious or may lose consciousness for a few seconds or minutes. Other symptoms of mild TBI include headache, vomiting, nausea, lack of motor coordination, dizziness, difficulty balancing, lightheadedness, <b>blurred</b> <b>vision</b> or tired eyes, ringing in the ears, bad taste in the mouth, fatigue or lethargy, and changes in sleep patterns. Cognitive and emotional symptoms include behavioral or mood changes, confusion, and trouble with memory, concentration, attention, or thinking. Mild TBI symptoms may also be present in moderate and severe injuries.|$|E
5|$|Beer {{contains}} ethyl alcohol, {{the same}} chemical that {{is present in}} wine and distilled spirits and as such, beer consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol {{in the human body}} have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan over which the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and <b>blurred</b> <b>vision.</b> A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious) and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. As with all alcoholic drinks, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have severe criminal penalties against drunk driving.|$|E
25|$|Other possible, but rare {{side effects}} include speech difficulty, urinary urgency, <b>blurred</b> <b>vision,</b> {{flushing}} and warmth.|$|E
50|$|Emotional tears {{have also}} been put into an {{evolutionary}} context. One study proposes that crying, by <b>blurring</b> <b>vision,</b> can handicap aggressive or defensive actions, and may function as a reliable signal of appeasement, need, or attachment. Oren Hasson, an evolutionary psychologist in the zoology department at Tel Aviv University believes that crying shows vulnerability and submission to an attacker, solicits sympathy and aid from bystanders, and signals shared emotional attachments.|$|R

25|$|M1 and M2 muscarinic {{acetylcholine}} receptors (causing anticholinergic {{symptoms such as}} dry mouth, <b>blurred</b> <b>vision,</b> constipation, difficulty or {{inability to}} urinate, sinus tachycardia, electrocardiographic changes and loss of memory, but the anticholinergic action may attenuate extrapyramidal side effects).|$|E
25|$|Particularly the {{time-release}} variety, at {{extremely high}} doses, can cause acute toxic reactions. Extremely {{high doses of}} niacin can also cause niacin maculopathy, a thickening of the macula and retina, which leads to <b>blurred</b> <b>vision</b> and blindness. This maculopathy is reversible after niacin intake ceases.|$|E
30|$|Majority of {{patients}} had unilateral disease, 97 (80.8 %), and {{involvement of the}} left eye (78, 54.5 %) was more common. <b>Blurring</b> of <b>vision</b> (106, 74.1 %), eye redness (52, 36.4 %), eye pain or discomfort (42, 29.4 %), and floaters (16, 11.2 %) were ocular symptoms at presentation. The <b>blurring</b> of <b>vision</b> (85, 68.5 %) {{was the most common}} presenting complaint, followed by eye redness (20, 16.1 %) and eye pain or discomfort (14, 11.3 %).|$|R
50|$|Trabectome {{is unique}} among the MIGS procedures, {{as there is}} no {{physical}} device implanted inside the eye; the pressure lowering is a direct result from the destruction and removal of the trabecular meshwork. Studies have found a decrease in intraocular pressure to the mid-teens following the procedure, which has a favorable safety profile. The most common complication from Trabectome surgery is bleeding, which can <b>blur</b> <b>vision</b> and take extra time to recover. The surgery site can scar over time and the pressure can go back up.|$|R
5000|$|Swimming: Must be {{watertight}} {{to prevent}} water, such as salt water when {{swimming in the}} ocean, or chlorinated water when swimming in a pool, from irritating the eyes or <b>blurring</b> <b>vision.</b> Allow swimmers to see clearly underwater. They will not be usable {{more than a few}} feet underwater, because the water pressure will press them tightly against the face. (Below this limit, a diving mask must be used, which allows the user to equalize pressure by exhaling air through the nose.) Examples of these include Swedish goggles.|$|R
25|$|Paroxetine shares many of {{the common}} adverse effects of SSRIs, {{including}} (with the corresponding rates seen in people treated with placebo in parentheses): nausea 26% (9%), diarrhea 12% (8%), constipation 14% (9%), dry mouth 18% (12%), somnolence 23% (9%), insomnia 13% (6%), headache 18% (17%), hypomania 1% (0.3%), <b>blurred</b> <b>vision</b> 4%(1%), loss of appetite 6% (2%), nervousness 5% (3%), paraesthesia 4% (2%), dizziness 13% (6%), asthenia (weakness; 15% (6%)), tremor 8% (2%), sweating 11% (2%), and sexual dysfunction (≥10% incidence). Most of these adverse effects are transient and go away with continued treatment. Central and peripheral 5-HT3 receptor stimulation is believed to result in the gastrointestinal effects observed with SSRI treatment. Compared to other SSRIs, it has a lower incidence of diarrhea, {{a higher incidence of}} anticholinergic effects (e.g., dry mouth, constipation, <b>blurred</b> <b>vision,</b> etc.), sedation/somnolence/drowsiness, sexual side effects, and weight gain.|$|E
25|$|Botulism is a {{rare and}} {{potentially}} fatal illness caused by a toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The disease begins with weakness, <b>blurred</b> <b>vision,</b> feeling tired, and trouble speaking. This may then be followed by weakness of the arms, chest muscles, and legs. The disease does not usually affect consciousness or cause a fever.|$|E
25|$|There {{are eight}} {{serological}} varieties of the bacterium denoted by the letters A to H. The toxin {{from all of}} these acts {{in the same way}} and produces similar symptoms: the motor nerve endings are prevented from releasing acetylcholine, causing flaccid paralysis and symptoms of <b>blurred</b> <b>vision,</b> ptosis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, cramps, and respiratory difficulty.|$|E
25|$|Carl Fisher {{was born}} in Greensburg, Indiana, nine {{years after the end}} of the American Civil War, the son of Albert H. and Ida Graham Fisher. Apparently {{suffering}} from alcoholism, a problem which would also plague Carl later in life, his father left the family when Fisher was a child. Suffering from severe astigmatism, it was difficult for Carl to pay attention in school, as uncorrected astigmatism can cause headaches or eyestrain, and <b>blur</b> <b>vision</b> at all distances. He quit school when he was twelve years old to help support his family.|$|R
25|$|Floaters {{are able}} to catch and refract light in ways that {{somewhat}} <b>blur</b> <b>vision</b> temporarily until the floater moves to a different area. Often they trick persons who are troubled by floaters into thinking they see {{something out of the}} corner of their eye that really is not there. Most persons come to terms with the problem, after a time, and learn to ignore their floaters. For persons with severe floaters it is nearly impossible to completely ignore the large masses that constantly stay within almost direct view.|$|R
