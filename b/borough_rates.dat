40|$|The early Science and Art {{classes in}} Stockton did no {{practical}} work other than drawing {{and the two}} Mechanics’ Institutes were comparatively unimportant. Rapid expansion of the iron industry caused an influx of workers and their children so that the school board was initially fully occupied in providing elementary education. It was not until 1896, after much local controversy, that the Higher Grade School was opened – financed by grants from the Education Department, the Science and Art Department, The County Council, and the <b>Borough's</b> <b>rates.</b> Illegal financing of the Organised Science School was recognised as a danger but the practice continued. Aid from the County Council's "Whiskey Money" was also given to the original High Schools in the town and, later, to the Queen Victoria High School for Girls and the Stockton Grammar School for Boys. The Girls' High School flourished but there were many difficulties with the Boys' Grammar School which only just survived. Stockton Technical Institute began in 1896 in the Higher Grade School building. Grouped Courses of instruction were slowly introduced against much local opposition. The 1902 Act was opposed by both Borough and County Councils. There was for many years a lack of apparatus for truly technical classes - the County gave greater priority to the early establishment of a free system of secondary education. Local industry established the Stockton Continuation School in the 1920 's - this school functioned on a day release basis for several years but soon after the parent firm ceased trading it was closed down by the County authority.

METHODS: All relevant cases attended by the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) in a {{three and a half}} year period were reviewed and the locations related to the <b>boroughs.</b> The <b>rates,</b> per 1, 000 resident children, were compared with socioeconomic indices for the boroughs concerned. In addition, a survey was undertaken of window fittings and maintenance in high rise flats close to one particular incident. RESULTS: A total of 90 incidents were attended involving 91 patients (64 male, 27 female) of whom five died. HEMS attends approximately one third of incidents involving serious trauma. In the study period the maximum frequency was 0. 2 fallers per 1, 000 resident children, occurring in three boroughs. In three boroughs there were no fallers. There was no overlap in socioeconomic indices between the five boroughs with the highest fall rates and the five with the lowest. The building survey found a high incidence of faulty window catches, a slow response rate for repair, and a lack of safety advice for residents.

Abstract: Growing evidence suggests an association between access to urban greenspace and mental health and wellbeing. Street trees may be an important facet of everyday exposure to nature in urban environments, but there is little evidence regarding their role in influencing population mental health. In this brief report, we raise the issue of street trees in the nature-health nexus, and use secondary data sources to examine the association between the density of street trees (trees/km street) in London <b>boroughs</b> and <b>rates</b> of antidepressant prescribing. After adjustment for potential confounders, and allowing for unmeasured area-effects using Bayesian mixed effects models, we find an inverse association, with a decrease of 1. 18 prescriptions per thousand population per unit increase in trees per km of street (95 % credible interval 0. 00, 2. 45). This study suggests that street trees may be a positive urban asset to decrease the risk of negative mental health outcomes.

2500|$|From the 1950s to the present, the borough’s {{history has}} been {{dominated}} by its population growth and urbanization, along with the problems that come with it.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} four sociodemographic measures (unemployment, overcrowding, low social class, {{and the proportion of}} migrants from areas of high prevalence of tuberculosis) and average level and rate of change of notification rates for tuberculosis. DESIGN [...] Ecological analysis of both the average and the rate of change of standardised annual notification rates for tuberculosis from 1982 - 91 and sociodemographic measures from the 1981 and 1991 censuses. SETTING [...] 32 London boroughs. SUBJECTS AND DATA [...] Sociodemographic measures from the 1981 and 1991 censuses and tuberculosis notification rates for 1982 - 91. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] A measure of the association between average levels and rate of change in tuberculosis notification rates and four sociodemographic measures in 1981 and between the rate of change in tuberculosis notification rates between 1981 and 1991 and changes in sociodemographic measures between 1981 and 1991. RESULTS [...] The average level of notifications was correlated with overcrowding and the proportion of migrants but not with unemployment or social class. No significant association was found between the rate of change in notification rates and sociodemographic measures in 1981. An association was found between increases in unemployment and the rate of change in notification rates, but the effect was small. Changes in the levels of unemployment explained 23 % of the variation between <b>boroughs</b> in the <b>rate</b> of change in their notification rates. CONCLUSION [...] The average tuberculosis notification rates were related to overcrowding and the proportion of migrants in 1981.

40|$|BACKGROUND—The {{geographical}} distribution of tuberculosis in England and Wales and changes since 1983 were examined {{using data from}} the 1988 and 1993 national surveys of tuberculosis notifications.  METHODS—Notification rates for England and Wales in 1988 and 1993 were calculated for geographical areas using Office for National Statistics (ONS) mid year population estimates. Those for the standard regions and the Greater London boroughs were calculated for the main ethnic groups. Those for the counties and local authorities were calculated for all ethnic groups combined. These were compared {{using data from the}} 1983 national survey as a baseline.  RESULTS—Wide regional variations in notification rates persist with Greater London having the highest rates. Rates in the ethnic group from the Indian subcontinent (ISC) were high in all regions, whilst those of the white ethnic group varied fourfold. Twenty seven of the 33 London <b>boroughs</b> showed increased <b>rates</b> in 1993 compared with 1988. In general, those local authority areas with high rates had high proportions of notifications in individuals of ISC ethnic origin, emphasising the continuing important contribution of ethnic minority groups to local tuberculosis rates. The number of local authority areas with notification rates four times the national average increased, but the number of areas with low or zero rates increased even more.  CONCLUSIONS—The distribution of tuberculosis in England and Wales continues to vary markedly by geographical area. The distribution is becoming increasingly polarised with a {{growth in the number of}} areas with very high rates of notifications and a greater increase in the number of areas with very few notifications. Patients from ethnic minorities continued to contribute a substantial and increasing proportion of all reported tuberculosis cases in most regions in 1988 and 1993. These findings have important implications for the provision of tuberculosis services in England and Wales. ...|$|R

A 2006 study by UNESCO and Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana has shown that there are still very high levels of pollution (both garbage and fecal matter) in the canals and there still a rapid rate of deterioration 2,000 hectares of protected area. UNESCO has placed the most blame for the problems on the proliferation of illegal human settlements in the protected zone. Each year the borough loses six hectares of former lakebed to illegal settlements. According to the borough, about 90,000 people in Xochimilco live in illegal settlements, such as those in ecological zones and 33,804 families live illegally on the chinampas. The most problematic are those closest to the canals, which cause the most pollution. The area is also sinking 18 cm per year due to over pumping of groundwater, and canals are being filled in illegally. The deterioration is happening so fast, that UNESCO has threatened to pull Xochimilco World Heritage Site status.Other major problems facing the canal system is the damage by introduced species and disease destroying native ones. Water lilies were introduced to the canals from Brazil in the 1940s. Since then, they have become a serious problem as their overgrowth depletes minerals and oxygen from the water. Up to 400 tons of the plant has been extracted from the canals monthly. In 2006, a Brazilian insect (Anthonomus grandis) was introduced to the canals to help control the plant. However, some need to be maintained because the axolotls are using them for reproduction purposes. Introduced species include carp and tilapia, which were introduced in the 1960s. However, these have been very detrimental to the native ecosystem, especially the axolotl, whose eggs they eat. Despite tons of the fish being caught in the canals, they are still a serious problem. Another major problem is the loss of trees, especially junipers in the ecological zone. Over sixty percent of the area is considered to be serious deforested and eighty percent of the junipers have the parasitic plant mistletoe.Since being declared a World Heritage Site, there have been attempts to rescue the canal system. The first major effort occurred between 1989 and 1994, which was called the “Rescate Ecológico.” It had the goal of constructing a large artificial lake for tourism and sports covering 360 hectares, ten times the size of the lake in Chapultepec Park. These would be divided into two parts called the Ciénega Grande and Ciénega Chica on the side of the Periférico Sur. It would also include the creation of a chinampa zone, and areas for culture and commerce and elevated buildings over the two sides of the Periférico Sur similar to those in the San Jerónimo area. However, this plan was stopped by agricultural communities in the area, which have a long history of defending their rights. However, since then, the area has been urbanized. It was replaced by a much smaller lake, with ecological area and plant market. In 2008, borough authorities began a reforestation program over 5,000 hectares of chinampas and forested areas at a cost of 20 million pesos. This program includes the cutting of non native species such as eucalyptus and certain pines and cedars to eradicate plagues associated with them. However, residents near forests such as in Nativitas oppose the cutting of healthy trees. These are to be replaced by native species, especially junipers in the chinampa areas. However, it is still estimated that because of the continuance of urban sprawl, the remaining canals and protected land will disappear within fifty years.|$|R
