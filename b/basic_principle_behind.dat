25|$|The {{concept of}} emergence—that the {{properties}} and functions {{found at a}} hierarchical level are not present and are irrelevant at the lower levels–is often a <b>basic</b> <b>principle</b> <b>behind</b> self-organizing systems. An example of self-organization in biology leading to emergence {{in the natural world}} occurs in ant colonies. The queen does not give direct orders and does not tell the ants what to do. Instead, each ant reacts to stimuli in the form of chemical scent from larvae, other ants, intruders, food and buildup of waste, and leaves behind a chemical trail, which, in turn, provides a stimulus to other ants. Here each ant is an autonomous unit that reacts depending only on its local environment and the genetically encoded rules for its variety of ant. Despite the lack of centralized decision making, ant colonies exhibit complex behaviour and have even been able to demonstrate the ability to solve geometric problems. For example, colonies routinely find the maximum distance from all colony entrances to dispose of dead bodies.|$|E
2500|$|Unarmed {{attacks are}} part of a {{specialized}} Bene Gesserit martial art which incorporates the prana-bindu methods of optimized muscle control. These enable one to deliver powerful blows and to move with extreme precision and speed. The <b>basic</b> <b>principle</b> <b>behind</b> it is that, as Farad'n of House Corrino says, [...] "My mind affects my reality." [...] A practitioner of the art has to know that the action he or she [...] "wants" [...] to perform has already been performed. For example, to imagine oneself behind an opponent at the current moment in time; when trained well, this knowledge will place you at the spot desired.|$|E
