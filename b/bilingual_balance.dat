40|$|The {{present study}} {{explored}} {{the relation between}} language control and nonverbal cognitive control in different bilingual populations. We compared monolinguals, Dutch-French unbalanced <b>bilinguals,</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals,</b> and interpreters on the Simon task (Simon & Rudell, 1967) and the Attention Network Test (ANT; Fan, McCandliss, Sommer, Raz, & Posner, 2002). All bilingual groups showed a smaller congruency effect in the Simon task than the monolingual group. They were also faster overall in the ANT. Furthermore, interpreters outperformed unbalanced, but not <b>balanced,</b> <b>bilinguals</b> in terms of overall accuracy on both tasks. In the ANT, the error congruency effect was significantly smaller for interpreters and <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals.</b> Using a measure of switching fluency in language production, this study also found direct evidence for a relation between language control and executive control. This relation was only observed in <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals,</b> where fluent switching was correlated with the Simon effect. These findings support {{the existence of a}} bilingual advantage and also indicate that different patterns of bilingual language use modulate {{the nature and extent of}} a cognitive control advantage in multilingual populations...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} the largely {{neglected}} long-term effects of bilingualism for students with roots in immigration. Our central research question is whether students' bilingual proficiencies {{have an impact on}} their future earnings in the USA. For this purpose, we used two different data-sets, i. e. the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS) and the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study (CILS). Based on Latent Class Analysis, we distinguish between three linguistic minority groups: limited <b>bilinguals,</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals</b> and English-dominant group. For both CILS and NELS, the results of regression analyses show that <b>balanced</b> <b>bilingual</b> students earn significantly more as adults {{at the beginning of their}} career than those linguistic minorities who were dominantly proficient in English only. Even after controlling for cognitive ability, educational attainment and parental socio-economic status, the additional cost of complete linguistic assimilation is estimated at $ 2100 -$ 3300 annually. The NELS-data also suggest that balanced bilingualism has an additional indirect effect through academic attainment. Policy implications of these results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{an ongoing}} debate, bilingual {{research}} currently discusses whether bilingualism enhances non-linguistic executive control. The {{goal of this}} study was to investigate the influence of language switching experience, rather than language proficiency, on this bilingual executive control advantage. We compared the performance of unbalanced <b>bilinguals,</b> <b>balanced</b> non-switching, and <b>balanced</b> switching <b>bilinguals</b> on two executive control tasks, i. e. a flanker and a Simon task. We found that the <b>balanced</b> switching <b>bilinguals</b> outperformed both other groups in terms of executive control performance, whereas the unbalanced and <b>balanced</b> non-switching <b>bilinguals</b> did not differ. These findings indicate that language switching experience, rather than high second-language proficiency, is the key determinant of the bilingual advantage in cognitive control processes related to interference resolution...|$|R
40|$|In the {{contemporary}} globalized world, with diverse situations of language contact emerging, bilingualism {{is taking on}} dynamic new forms, yielding {{a new kind of}} bilinguals: balanced. Adopting a stance of resistance to the monolingual bias and with a view to refining the frameworks applied to the study of bilinguals, this research examines how <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals</b> process and express their emotions in each of their languages. This is a qualitative study that incorporates narrative inquiry and uses the narratives and autobiographical memories of five <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals,</b> of different language pairs and age/gender groups to better understand how these <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals</b> perceive their emotional processing and expression through their language socialization experiences. The findings suggest that identity is a crucial factor in determining balanced bilinguals’ emotional expression which varied from being ideal in the first language, in the second language, and in both.

In order to study vowel perception in <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals,</b> a behavioral identification task was performed.

40|$|The present {{dissertation}} {{investigated the}} development of visual word recognition in bilingual children {{at the beginning of}} initial reading acquisition. The central aim was to contribute to the debate on differences in orthographic processing between bilinguals and monolinguals, expanding the body of existing research by knowledge on bilingual word recognition mechanisms in beginning readers of German. The two main goals were to (1) study differences in the developmental trajectories of reading between first (L 1) and second (L 2) language speakers, and (2) to investigate {{the development of}} orthographic processing mechanisms that are specific to the bilingual word recognition system. To disentangle developmental effects between dominant and <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals,</b> four studies were conducted, of which two focused on children learning to read in German as their L 2, and two examined German-English <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals</b> learning to read concurrently in both languages. Study 1 investigated performance differences between L 1 and L 2 speakers in different component processes of reading, while controlling for the impact of linguistic and executive functioning skills. Study 2 zoomed in on the mechanisms of lexical access and compared L 1 and L 2 speakers’ lexical decision performance with regard to the impact of linguistic characteristics throughout elementary school. In study 3, the parallel activation of orthographic as well as semantic representations in both languages of <b>balanced</b> <b>bilingual</b> children was examined by studying the processing of cognates and false friends in German and English.

The major aim of this study having an ex-post facto design was to find out whether linguality has any impact on the awareness and use of metacognitive, cognitive and total cognitive/metacognitive strategies in respective of students proficiency levels. Throughout this study the researchers found that dominant and <b>balanced</b> <b>bilingual</b> students differed significantly in their cognitive, metacognitive as well as total cognitive/metacognitive strategy scores, meaning that <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals</b> had significantly higher scores than dominant bilingual students.

50|$|The {{topic of}} native speaker also {{gives way to}} {{discussion}} about what exactly bilingualism is. One definition is {{that a person is}} bilingual by being equally proficient in both languages. A person who grows up speaking English and begins learning Spanish for four years is not necessarily bilingual unless he speaks the two languages with equal fluency. Pearl and Lambert were the first to test only “balanced” bilinguals—that is, children who are completely fluent in two languages and feel that neither is their “native” language because they grasp the two so perfectly. This study found the following: <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals</b> perform significantly better in tasks that require flexibility (they constantly shift between the two known languages depending on the situation/requires constant juggling), more aware of arbitrary nature of language and also that <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals</b> choose word associations based on logical rather than phonetic preferences.|$|R

40|$|On the surface, bi- and {{multilingualism}} {{would seem}} to be an ideal context for exploring questions of typological proximity. The obvious intuition is that the more closely related two languages are, the easier it should be to implement the two languages in one mind. This is the starting point adopted here, but we immediately run into the difficulty that the overwhelming majority of cognitive, computational, and linguistic research on bi- and multilingualism exhibits a monolingual bias (i. e., where monolingual grammars are used as the standard of comparison for outputs from bilingual grammars). The primary questions so far have focused on how <b>bilinguals</b> <b>balance</b> and switch between their two languages, but our perspective on typology leads us to consider the nature of bi- and multi-lingual systems as a whole. Following an initial proposal from Hsin (2014), we conjecture that bilingual grammars are neither isolated, nor (completely) conjoined with one another in the bilingual mind, but rather exist as integrated source grammars that are further mitigated by a common, combined grammar (Cook, 2016; Goldrick et al., 2016 a,b; Putnam and Klosinski, 2017). Here we conceive such a combined grammar in a parallel, distributed, and gradient architecture implemented in a shared vector-space model that employs compression through routinization and dimensionality reduction. We discuss the emergence of such representations and their function in the minds of bilinguals. This architecture aims to be consistent with empirical results on bilingual cognition and memory representations in computational cognitive architectures...|$|R
40|$|Even though {{before the}} 1960 ’s {{bilingualism}} was generally blamed for detrimental effects on cognitive de-velopment, various researchers {{have argued that}} studies carried out before that date included unbalanced bilinguals or bilinguals from minority groups; their results were hence unreliable. In contrast, many con-temporary studies have reported positive cognitive effects of balanced bilingualism, especially regarding metalinguistic skills (i. e., the ability to look at language rather than through it to the intended meaning). By and large, studies that have administered metalinguistic tasks such as grammaticality judgment tasks, word awareness tasks, phoneme segmentation tasks, and Appearance-Reality tasks to groups of <b>balanced</b> <b>bilingual</b> and monolingual children of comparable ages report superior performance by the bilingual children; the lat-ter group shows greater levels of control and analysis, which are fundamentally metalinguistic skills.

40|$|It was {{the purpose}} of this {{research}} to analyze the naming rate of three groups of <b>bilingual</b> children (Spanish-dominant, <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals,</b> English-dominant) and one group of monolingual English children on picture and number stimuli. Speed of response and error rate were analyzed. The 58 subjects ranged in age from four to seven and in grades from four-year-old kindergarten to first. All bilingual subjects were enrolled in a bilingual transitional program with monolingual subjects enrolled in regular education classes in the same school. All subjects were identified as average students of middle to low socioeconomic status. The stimuli were 50 pictures of common objects and two sets of five numbers (Set 1 was numbers 1 to 5; Set 2 was five numbers chosen from 1 to 10). The stimuli were projected on a screen, and the child had to name what he or she saw as quickly as possible. A voice-activated relay was used in order to obtain accurate time measurements. Bilingual children were tested on all stimuli twice, once in each language. Half the bilingual children were made to switch to their other language once in each test session; the other half were tested in only one language per session. For English responses to picture and number stimuli, the only significant differences found were between the English monolinguals and the Spanish-dominant bilinguals. For bilingual responses to picture stimuli, both English-dominant and <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals</b> performed as predicted. None of the planned comparisons for bilingual responses to number stimuli generated significant differences. No significant difference in response rate was found for children required to switch languages in a test session. Switching did not interact with other factors.

English dominant, Spanish dominant, and <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals</b> read passages in English biasing either a figurative (e. g., describing a weak and soft fighter that always lost and everyone hated) or a literal (e. g., describing a donut and bakery shop that made delicious pastries) meaning of a critical metaphoric referential description (e. g., creampuff). We recorded the eye movements (first fixation, gaze duration, go-past duration, and total reading time) for the critical region, which was a metaphoric referential description in each passage. The results revealed that literal vs. figurative meaning activation was modulated by language dominance, where Spanish dominant bilinguals {{were more likely to}} access the literal meaning, and English dominant and <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals</b> had access to both the literal and figurative meanings of the metaphoric referential description. Overall, there was a general tendency for the literal interpretation to be more active, as revealed by shorter reading times for the metaphoric reference used literally, in comparison to when it was used figuratively.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{determine}} how older bilingual subjects' naming performance is affected by their knowledge of two languages. Twenty-nine aging (mean age = 74. 0; SD = 7. 1) Spanish-English bilinguals were asked to name all pictures in the Boston Naming Test (BNT) first in their dominant language and then in their less-dominant language. Bilinguals with similar naming scores in each language, or relatively <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals,</b> named more pictures correctly when credited for producing a correct name in either language. <b>Balanced</b> <b>bilinguals</b> also named fewer pictures in their dominant language than unbalanced bilinguals, and named more pictures correctly in both languages if the pictures had cognate names (e. g., dart is dardo in Spanish). Unbalanced bilinguals did not benefit from the alternative (either-language) scoring procedure and showed cognate effects only in their nondominant language. These findings may help to guide the interpretation of neuropsychological data {{for the purpose of}} determining cognitive status in older bilinguals and can be used to develop models of bilingual language processing.

40|$|Because of {{the high}} {{variability}} in any bilingual population, it {{is of a great}} importance to control for language dominance in both research and language assessment. This control is crucial in research in order to form unified groups of participants according to language dominance. In the language assessment of bilingual children, determining language dominance should be a priority. Children exposed to two languages from an early age may acquire them at a slower rate when compared to their monolingual piers. While this lag is hardly noticeable in some children, for others it is significant. Without knowledge about the child’s language skills in the other, non-assessed language, it is impossible to determine if the results of language assessment point to the dominance of one language over another or general language difficulties. In bilingual areas of Croatia, such as Rijeka and Istria, this can be quite a challenge. While language dominance has generally been measured using a large number of different methods, there is no universally accepted procedure. This research uses the results of the Italian and Croatian versions of the TROG test to determine language dominance. Participants were 56 preschool-aged children attending kindergartens with an Italian language programme in Rijeka and Istria.

40|$|International audienceNumerous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that bilingual children have a processing advantage on verbal and non-­‐verbal problem solving tasks requiring high levels of control of attention, a skill component enabling subjects to suppress distracting or misleading information while focusing their attention on some other element (e. g. Ben-­‐ Zeev, 1977; Bialystok, 1986 a and 1986 b; Ricciardelli, 1992; Bialystok and Majumder, 1998; Cromdal, 1999; Bialystok and Martin, 2004; Bialystok and Shapero, 2005; Bialystok and Martin-­‐Rhee, 2008). A study was conducted to investigate the effects of differing levels of bilingualism on metalinguistic awareness. The participants were 38 English-­‐French bilingual children aged six to eight, of middle to high socio-­‐economic status, attending an international school in France. Language proficiency was measured using the standardised English and French versions of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (Dunn et al., 1987; Dunn et al., 1993). Metalinguistic awareness, considered here in terms of Bialystok’s analysis and control framework (Bialystok and Ryan, 1985; Bialystok, 1986 a and 2001) and Cummins’ (1976) threshold hypothesis, was assessed through seven metalinguistic tasks based on Ricciardelli (1993), which were given to the children in both their languages. The results were generally consistent with Bialystok’s and Cummins’ predictions. High level <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals</b> outperformed dominant bilinguals on tasks requiring a high degree of control of linguistic processing and on certain analysis tasks, but importantly in our study, only when the child’s best score, sometimes coming from the weaker language, was considered.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDespite {{the number}} of bilinguals and {{speakers}} of English and Mandarin worldwide, up till now {{there have been no}} investigations of stuttering in any of the Chinese languages, or in bilinguals who speak both English and Mandarin. Hence, it is not known whether stuttering behavior in Mandarin mimics that in English, or whether speech restructuring techniques such as Prolonged Speech produce the same fluency outcomes in Mandarin speakers as they do for English speakers. Research into stuttering in bilinguals is available but far from adequate. Although the limited extant studies show that bilinguals who stutter (BWS) may stutter either the same or differently across languages, and that treatment effects in one language can automatically carry over to the other language, it is unclear whether these findings are influenced by factors such as language dominance or language structure. These issues need to be clarified because speech language pathologists (SLPs) who work with bilinguals often do not speak the dominant language of their clients. Thus, the language of assessment and treatment becomes an important clinical consideration. The aim of this thesis was to investigate (a) whether the severity and type of stuttering was different in English and Mandarin in English-Mandarin bilingual adults, (b) whether this difference was influenced by language dominance, (c) whether stuttering reductions in English generalized to Mandarin following treatment in English only, and (d) whether treatment generalization was influenced by language dominance. To achieve these aims, a way of establishing the dominant language in bilinguals was a necessary first step. The first part of this thesis reviews the disorder of stuttering and the treatment for adults who stutter, the differences between English and Chinese languages, and stuttering in bilinguals. Part Two of this thesis describes the development of a tool for determining language dominance in a multilingual Asian population such as that found in Singapore. This study reviews the complex issues involved in assessing language dominance. It presents the rationale for and description of a self-report classification tool for identifying the dominant language in English-Mandarin bilingual Singaporeans. The decision regarding language dominance was based on a predetermined set of criteria using self-report questionnaire data on language proficiency, frequency of language use, and domain of language use. The tool was administered to 168 English-Mandarin bilingual participants, and the self-report data were validated against the results of a discriminant analysis. The discriminant analysis revealed a reliable three-way classification into English-dominant, Mandarin-dominant, and <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals.</b> Scores on a single word receptive vocabulary test supported these dominance classifications. Part Three of this thesis contains two studies investigating stuttering in BWS. The second study of this thesis examined the influence of language dominance on the manifestation of stuttering in English-Mandarin BWS. Results are presented for 30 English-Mandarin BWS who were divided according to their bilingual classification group: 15 English-dominant, four Mandarin-dominant, and 11 <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals.</b> All participants underwent comprehensive speech evaluations in both languages. The English-dominant and Mandarin-dominant BWS were found to exhibit greater stuttering in their less dominant language, whereas the <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals</b> evidenced similar levels of stuttering in both languages. An analysis of the types of stutter using the Lidcombe Behavioral Data Language showed no significant differences between English and Mandarin for all bilingual groups. In the third study of this thesis, the influence of language dominance on the generalization of stuttering reductions from English to Mandarin was investigated. Results are provided for seven English-dominant, three Mandarin-dominant, and four <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals</b> who underwent a Smooth Speech intensive program in English only. A comparison of stuttering between their pretreatment scores and three posttreatment interval scores indicated that the degree of fluency transfer from the treated to the untreated language was disproportionate. English-dominant and Mandarin-dominant participants showed greater fluency improvement in their dominant language even if this language was not directly treated. In the final chapter, Part Four, a hypothesis is provided to explain the findings of this thesis. A discussion of the limitations of the thesis and suggestions for future research are also presented. The chapter concludes with a summary of the main contributions that this thesis makes to the field of stuttering in bilinguals...|$|R

It was hypothesized that different types of bilinguals perform differently on tests of reading as CALP and speaking as BICS. A total number of 96 senior learners of English as an L 3 within the age range of 21 - 24 participated in this study. Fifty two (28 female, 24 male) were fully biliterate Kurdish-Arabic EFL learners from Salahaddin University in Kurdistan, Iraq and the remaining 44 (12 female, 32 male) were Kurdish-Persian bilingual learners of English from Kurdistan University in Kurdistan, Iran. Data was collected through a highly reliable linguistic background questionnaire and the reading and speaking tests of the First Certificate in English (FCE). Results submitted {{to a series of}} two-way ANOVA statistical test indicated that bilingual subjects performed better than biliterates in reading. On the other hand, no statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups with regard to their performance in BICS. In addition, findings indicated no significant interaction between linguistic background and gender of the participants as it impacted performance in L 3 tasks. Findings are discussed in relation to the effect of active use of languages in the community, and the differential effect of degrees of bilingualism on L 3 acquisition...|$|R
40|$|Is it {{possible}} to tell whether bilinguals are able to read simple text in their two languages equally fluently? Is it thus possible to distinguish <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals</b> from unbalanced bilinguals with respect to reading fluency in their first language (L 1) and second language (L 2) ? In this study, we avoided making direct comparisons between L 1 and L 2 reading speeds, comparing, instead, the amount of inhibition caused by a nonlinguistic, external factor (degraded text visibility). In two tasks, 32 university students read 20 target sentences in L 1 Dutch and L 2 English, each sentence appearing both in normal and in poorly readable font. Degraded font affected reading times substantially, more so in L 2 than in L 1, as predicted. However, it was not found that participants with higher L 2 proficiency were less affected by degraded font in L 2 reading than participants with lower L 2 proficiency...|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt is}} made in the present paper to resolve {{inconsistencies}} between the results of recent studies which have reported that bilingualism is associated with positive cognitive conseguencee and earlier studies which suggested that bilingualism might adversely affect cognitive and scholastic progress. Because recent studies involved <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals</b> and were carried out in "additive " bilingual settings, the bilingual subjects in these studies are likely to have attained a high level of competence in the second language (L 2) at no cost to their level of competence in the first language (L 1). However', earlier studies tended to involve bilingual subjects from language minority groups whose L 1 was gradually being replaced by their L 2. Thus, {{it is not surprising that}} many of these earlier studies produced evidence of a "balance effect, " i. e., that a bilingual paid for his L 2 competence by a lowering of his L 1 competence. On the basis of the differences i...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The present article {{involves}} an empirical psycholinguistic study aimed at examining syntactic complexity in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) by early <b>balanced</b> Bosnian/Swedish <b>bilingual</b> EFL learners. 15 early <b>balanced</b> <b>bilingual</b> Bosnian/Swedish EFL learners were recruited {{for the study}} and matched with their respective control groups of intermediate EFL learners (15 speakers of Bosnian as their first language (L 1) and 15 speakers of Swedish as their L 1). The experimental task involved an unprepared writing assignment in English about the most significant invention of the 20 th century. The corpus of the participants’ written assignments was analysed in L 2 Syntactic Complexity Analyzer and SPSS software programs respectively. Data analysis involved measures of syntactical complexity. It {{has been found that}} the participants’ written assignments are characterised by statistically significant number of T-units scores in comparison with the Swedish L 1 monolingual controls. These findings are further presented and discussed in the article...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports two studies. The {{first one}} investigates how two 10 -year-old Taiwanese-Hungarian <b>balanced</b> <b>bilingual</b> twin boys {{translated}} sentence-embedded words between their native languages over a six-month period as the physical context around them changed. The second one compares how these two bilinguals and four monolingual children defined words {{in their native}} languages. The purpose is twofold: to explore {{the role of an}} active language in translation, and to propose a new measurement for bilinguals. The reaction time (RT) and accuracy of their verbal protocols were measured and analyzed. The bilingual children’s word translation reveals an active use of metalinguistic skills. The physical context did affect their RT and accuracy in general and in translating concrete/abstract concepts. The two bilinguals defined words as fast and accurate as their monolingual peers in both languages, but different definition aspects were identified from the answers of the two groups. The translation/definition task appears a comprehensive measurement for bilingual and monolingual children with any combination of languages...|$|R
40|$|Using a masked phonological priming paradigm, Brysbaert, Van Dyck and Van de Poel (1999) {{showed that}} Dutch-French bilinguals perform better at {{identifying}} tachistoscopically presented L 2 words (e. g. oui [yes]) when those words are primed by L 1 words or nonwords that are homophonic to the L 2 target word {{according to the}} L 1 grapheme-phoneme conversion rules (e. g. wie [who]). They noted that this priming effect was smaller for <b>balanced</b> <b>bilinguals</b> than for less proficient bilinguals, although the interaction failed to reach significance. Findings of Gollan, Forster and Frost (1997) suggest {{that this could be}} attributed to a greater reliance on phonology in L 2 reading, caused by a smaller proficiency in this language. However, in this study we show that the Dutch-French cross-lingual phonological priming effect is equally large for perfectly balanced and less proficient bilinguals. Our findings are in line with more recent work of Van Wijnendaele and Brysbaert (2002) ...|$|R
