40|$|An {{economic}} evaluation is presented of a technology aimed to remove {{moisture from the}} blast in blast furnaces in order to decrease coke consumption and provide savings {{in the amount of}} steam and oxygen injected. Blast dehumidification also provides opportunities to increase gas load in the blast furnace area, since gas can replace moisture as a control agent in the furnace and can be used to operate the blast dehumidification system. This work estimated {{the costs and benefits of}} blast dehumidification systems based on information provided by the system vendors and on the researchers' engineering judgement. The economics have been found to be quite attractive. Operators can obtain savings from $ 0. 5 to more than $ 2. 5 per ton simply by reducing <b>blast</b> <b>moisture</b> to seasonal average maxima. Blast dehumidification systems show net present value (NPV) /investment ratios of more than 3. 5, with two-year paybacks, when dehumidifying this blast. The economics remain attractive, with NPV/investment ratios of 1. 75 and three-year payback, when dehumidifying blast in furnaces using ambient moisture practice, so long as annual average humidities equal or exceed 3 - 3. 5 grains of moisture per standard cubic foot of air. ...|$|E
