5|$|A $2.5 {{million bond}} issue passed in 1922 for a stadium {{conceived}} by Burnham. Designed by architects Holabird & Roche and named Soldier Field for {{the veterans of}} World War I, cost overruns required another bond issue in 1926. By 1924, the breakwater wall stretched from 14th to 55th Streets. In 1926, Soldier Field and a portion of Lake Shore Drive were opened. Landfilling extended from 23rd Street to 56th Street; however, Promontory Point was not complete, prompting complaints regarding garbage, <b>blowing</b> <b>sand</b> and odors. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, landfill efforts continued to fill in Burnham Park and the adjacent Northerly Island. The South Development was named for Daniel Burnham on January 14, 1927, and support increased for a world's fair in the park. Construction was completed on Lake Shore Drive, with northbound lanes named for Leif Erikson, and southbound lanes for Christopher Columbus. In 1929, construction of the park at Promontory Point began. The Great Depression delayed work and prevented construction of nearshore islands. Burnham Park was chosen for {{the site of the}} Century of Progress world's fair and a yacht basin was built south of 51st Street.|$|E

40|$|In view of {{the actual}} status of coastal dune {{fixation}} in our country, the present paper mainly reports the basic research result through wind tunnel experiment {{for the purpose of}} aiming at rational <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> control. First of all, the actual status of <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> damage and its prevention works is introduced, and it is pointed out that to illucidate the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> phenomenon in sandy plain mainly such as artificial sand dune and also the interrelation of said phenomenon with water content of sand surface layer is of utmost importance for <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> control. Secondly, as establishment of measuring method is essential in experimental illudiation of these subjects, the measuring device of water content of sand surface layer utilizing light reflection and the device counting the number of <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> using laser were trially produced to make clear the characteristics and the range of application. In dealing with the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> phenomenon, the sand movement in dune sand of wind dry condition as its base and also the relation of the threshold velocity of <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> with the grain diameter distribution of sand dune are considered to be unclear in the conventional researches, and therefore the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> quantity formula in consideration of the grain diameter of sand dune was determined through demensional analysis and wind tunnel experiment. From this formula the writer could present the method of objectively judging the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> limit, ascertain its effectiveness, thereby making clear the interrelation between the grain diameter of dune <b>sand</b> and the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> limit. Furthermore, from on-the-spot survey and analysis of the relation of geographical features mainly in artificial sand dune with grain diameter distribution, and also from the wind tunnel experiment between errosion and grain diameter change, it was made clear that wind erosion and coarseness of grain diameter of dune sand are conspicuous in the land behind high artificial sand dune and that the land just behind artificial sand dune becomes the starting point of new <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> toward internal land. As both the sand movement of size-group and the threshold shear velocity of size-group, which are the cause of coarseness of grain diameter, have not been illucidated as to the subject of <b>blown</b> <b>sand,</b> the dimensionless equation for it has been looked for and obtained. In order to clarify the influcence of water content of sand surface layer on the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> quantity and the threshold velocity of <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> regarding the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> in the moistured sand surface condition, the influence of water content ratio was grasped as the change of coefficients respectively of the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> quantity equation in wind dry condition and of the dimensionless equation in threshold shear velocity, and its relation with water content ratio was obtained through experiments. The influcence of water content ratio on vertical distribution of <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> was also expressed by the relation of dimensionless coefficient with water content ratio, thereby making it clear that the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> quantity, while being uniformed in vertical direction, takes a special reduction configuration in inverse proportion to the increment of water content ratio, which attributes mainly to the saltation of <b>blown</b> <b>sand.</b> The relation of water content ratio with grain diameter of <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> was clarified by an index called the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> ratio of size-group in which both the median diameter of <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> and the standard deviation tend to get bigger in proportion to water content ratio, and also the sand of larger size-group tends to occupy a large portion of sand composition. Based on the aforementioned respective results, it was discussed as its conclusion that contriving 2 ̆ 2 uniformity of grain diameter and surface uniformity of geographical features 2 ̆ 2 is effective as a conceptive guidance relating to the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> control...|$|R

40|$|The Taklimakan Desert is {{the largest}} dunefield in China and the second largest {{shifting}} dunefield in the world. Control of the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> {{is important for the}} highway and oil bases there. Comprehensive studies suggest that the effective and feasible measures to control the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> include reed checkboard barriers, upright clustered reed fences, upright reed fences, upright nylon net fences, chemical and clay fixers and artificial vegetation. In practice, based on the type and extent of <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> damages, various control measures are combined to form effective shelter systems. Reed checkboards and fences are the most widely used along the highway because reed is the most easily available material. Nylon net fences are also widely used in places where sand drift is weak to speed up engineering construction. Chemical and clay fixers are useful to consolidate the side slopes of the road but not to be extended on a large scale due to their prohibitive cost. Artificial vegetation, which has provided a pleasing environment, is practiced in Tazhong to control <b>blown</b> <b>sand.</b> Because of their strong dependence on water, vegetative measures can be only recommended in areas where the ground-water is easily available and of reasonably good quality.

40|$|AbstractBlown sand {{movement}} {{threatened the}} ecosystems severely in arid zones. The research on <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> movement {{is an important}} component of the controlling <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> hazard. In the present study, we developed a method that based on GIS-based spatial analysis to calculate the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> movement above the surface of a barchan dune. To do so, we sampled the diameters of sand grains, wind velocity and sand flux above the surface of a barchan dune in Taklimakan Desert. Interpolated the sand grain diameters and wind velocity by means of Kriging and Inverse Distance Weighting, respectively, we got the continuous distribution of sand grain diameters and wind velocity above this dune. Integrated these interpolated results, we computed the aerodynamic roughness length, the friction velocity and the <b>sand</b> flux by <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> models. By this calculation method, the continuous distribution of the aerodynamic roughness length, the friction velocity and the sand flux were obtained. To test this calculation method, we compared these predicted data with the observed values. The tested results showed that the predicted results (the aerodynamic roughness length, the friction velocity and the sand flux) by this method are all satisfied except the sand flux above the dune's foot. We thought that the not enough accurately modeling result of sand flux above the dune's foot is caused by unsaturated sand flux was generated above there, and the models we used are all based the theory of saturated sand flux. Though cans not accurately modeling the sand flux above the dune's foot, this <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> movement calculation approach is better than those traditional observation methods on the whole...|$|R

Understandably, these brick remains at Abydos were first thought to be walls. In 1991, an important clarification was made. A research consensus decided these bricks were remnants of ancient walls after all, but not in the usual sense. They were actually the boundaries for more than a dozen ship burials from an early dynasty. Each ship grave had its own brick boundary walls. The outline of each grave was {{in the shape of a}} boat, and the surface of each was covered with mud plaster and white wash. Small boulders at the prow or stern of each grave represented anchors.

Inland the ground rose into a little hill, which, along with the islet, served as a sailing mark for seamen. When the hill was open of the islet to the north, vessels must bear well to the eastward to clear Graden Ness and the Graden Bullers. In the lower ground, a streamlet ran among the trees, and, being dammed with dead leaves and clay of its own carrying, spread out every here and there, and lay in stagnant pools.

60|$|The {{wind was}} not a Sirocco or Simoon, such as we {{associate}} with the desert, but a New England northeaster,--and we sought shelter in vain under the sand-hills, for it blew all about them, rounding them into cones, and was sure to find us out on whichever side we sat.
