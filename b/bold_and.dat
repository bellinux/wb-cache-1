5|$|It {{can become}} quite <b>bold</b> <b>and</b> tame, much like its close relative, the pied currawong on the Australian mainland, {{especially}} in public parks and gardens where people make {{a habit of}} feeding it.

5|$|Strong {{possessed the}} ability to find good holes on land that seemed far too severe for golf and had the gumption to build very <b>bold</b> <b>and</b> {{distinctive}} holes that are open to criticism but clearly are more thought provoking and interesting than most other architect's work. The green slopes that he envisioned and built on his courses were the single best defense of a hole.|$|E
5|$|The Nice were {{primarily}} a live band. Their stage performances were <b>bold</b> <b>and</b> violent, with Emerson incorporating feedback and distortion. He manhandled his Hammond L-100 organ, wrestling it and attacking it with daggers (which {{he used to}} hold down keys and sustain notes during these escapades). Emerson's playing was inspired by Jimi Hendrix, Billy Ritchie of Clouds, and Don Shinn as well as earlier figures such as pianist Jerry Lee Lewis.|$|E
5|$|The heroine, Annis, {{is one of}} Heyer's {{more modern}} characters. Her wealth and spinsterhood allow her a level of freedom that is unusual in a Heyer novel, {{as it was in}} the Regency period.

5|$|After the War of the Oranges, Portugal {{adopted a}} double policy. On {{the one hand}} John, Prince of Brazil, as regent of Portugal, signed the Treaty of Badajoz with France and Spain by which he assumed the duty to close the ports to British trade.

5|$|Despite {{not having}} a sting, the {{porcupine}} ray is capable of injuring humans with its many sharp thorns. It is reportedly <b>bold</b> <b>and</b> tolerant of being approached closely underwater. The tough, thorny skin of this ray, made into a form of leather called shagreen, had many historical uses. In particular, {{it was used to}} cover the hilts of various melee weapons, as its extremely rough texture prevented slippage during battle. For example, the Japanese deemed it the only species whose skin was acceptable for covering sword grips. The Malayans used it to cover shields. The skin was also used ornamentally, such as by the Chinese, who dyed it and ground down the thorns to yield a mottled pattern. The native inhabitants of Funafuti Atoll used dried portions of the ray's tail as a rasp-like tool.|$|E
5|$|Galapagos {{sharks are}} active predators often {{encountered}} in large groups. They feed mainly on bottom-dwelling bony fishes and cephalopods; larger individuals {{have a much}} more varied diet, consuming other sharks, marine iguanas, sea lions, and even garbage. As in other requiem sharks, reproduction is viviparous, with females bearing litters of 416 pups every 2 to 3 years. The juveniles tend to remain in shallow water to avoid predation by the adults. Galapagos sharks are <b>bold</b> <b>and</b> have behaved aggressively towards humans, and are thus regarded as dangerous. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as near threatened, as it has a slow reproductive rate and there is heavy fishing pressure across its range.|$|E
