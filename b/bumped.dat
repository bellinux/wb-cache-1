5|$|Louisville's {{second drive}} {{of the game}} was much quicker than the Cardinals' first. After {{beginning}} at their own 20-yard line, it took the Cardinals just seven plays to travel 80yards and earn a touchdown. Louisville was helped throughout the drive by repeated Virginia Tech personal foul penalties. Tech players committed three separate 15-yard personal fouls during the drive, one of which came after Louisville's successful extra point kick when cornerback Jimmy Williams <b>bumped</b> a game official. Williams was ejected from the game for the contact and {{was removed from the}} field after watching the next series from the sidelines. The touchdown and extra point extended Louisville's first-quarter lead to 14–3.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bump</b> {{capability}} in PayPal’s apps {{was removed}} in March 2012.

40|$|Abstract. For {{flip-chip}} {{process of}} RF system-on-packages(SOP), double <b>bump</b> bonding processes were investigated. Sn-Ag and Sn solder joints were {{formed by the}} reflowed double <b>bumping</b> process, and Sn/In/Sn <b>bump</b> joints were fabricated by the non-reflowed double <b>bump</b> bonding process. The height-to-size ratios of 0. 78 and 0. 65 were obtained for the reflowed double <b>bumping</b> and the non-reflowed <b>bumping,</b> respectively. Average contact resistance of the reflowed Sn-Ag and Sn solder joints was about 13 mΩ which was much lower than 24 ~ 33 mΩ of the non-reflowed Sn/In/Sn <b>bump</b> joints. The reflowed solder double <b>bumping</b> method is more suitable for flip-chip process of RF-SOP than the non-reflowed double <b>bump</b> bonding...|$|R
5|$|Neither Shepard nor Lovell {{expected}} {{there would}} be much difference between Apollo 13 and Apollo 14, but Apollo 13 went disastrously wrong. An oxygen tank explosion nearly resulted {{in the loss of}} the crew, and the moon landing was aborted. It became a joke between Shepard and Lovell, who would offer to give Shepard back the mission each time they <b>bumped</b> into each other. The failure of Apollo 13 delayed Apollo 14 until 1971 so that modifications could be made to the spacecraft. The target of the Apollo 14 mission was switched to the Fra Mauro formation, the intended destination of Apollo 13.|$|E
5|$|On May 20, 2006, Barrett was {{involved}} in an infamous altercation with A. J. Pierzynski during the Chicago Crosstown Classic between the Chicago White Sox and Cubs. During the game's second inning, Brian Anderson hit a sacrifice fly, which allowed Pierzynski to score the game's first run. Pierzynski collided with Barrett en route to home plate, causing Barrett to fall down. Pierzynski showed his enthusiasm by slapping home plate. As Pierzynski got up, he <b>bumped</b> into Barrett, who proceeded to punch him. Scott Podsednik came to Pierzynski's aid and subdued Barrett. Anderson and John Mabry eventually joined the brawl before both teams emptied their dugouts and stormed the field.|$|E
5|$|On lap 31, a multi-car {{collision}} {{occurred in}} turn 3 as Logano was <b>bumped</b> by Stewart, {{causing him to}} flip sideways, which collected Truex, Robby Gordon and Reed Sorenson, prompting the second caution. On the same lap, the red flag was shown to allow race officials to clear the track of debris. The race was restarted 24 minutes later under caution. Newman maintained his lead at the restart, followed by Kurt Busch and Menard. Three laps later, Montoya and Gordon passed Menard for fifth and sixth respectively. On lap 43, Jeff Burton fell to ninth after being passed by Hamlin and Martin. Four laps later, Martin passed Hamlin for the thirteenth position.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{methodology}} for electrical modelling of <b>bump</b> arrays up to a frequency of 30 GHz is presented. It {{starts with the}} development of an equivalent circuit model for a single <b>bump.</b> Based on the radio frequency (RF) modelling of this <b>bump,</b> equivalent circuit models were developed for any two parallel or diagonal <b>bumps,</b> which account for their electromagnetic (EM) interactions. These models were then extended to characterise three-coupled <b>bumps</b> in linear and triangular configurations. For these <b>bump</b> arrangements, it was proven, that considering pitches used in RF and high-speed packages, effects of EM coupling between outwardly-placed <b>bumps</b> on EM interaction between the adjacent ones can be neglected. It is actually on this basis, that a combination of all the electrical models developed can be used to characterise any <b>bump</b> array, irrespective of the number of <b>bumps</b> in the array. This was validated using a <b>bump</b> array consisting of four-coupled <b>bumps...</b>|$|R
50|$|The elbow <b>bump</b> as a {{greeting}} is also attributed to be a derivative {{of the more}} well known fist <b>bump,</b> beginning in the 1980s.

5|$|Terri Schuester {{is portrayed}} by actress Jessalyn Gilsig. Prior to her casting in Glee, Gilsig was an {{established}} actress {{in both the}} television and film industry, but had little theatrical experience. In casting Glee, series creator Ryan Murphy sought actors who could identify with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. For the first two seasons of Glee, Gilsig was billed as a contract player for the show.

5|$|The Champs Sports Bowl {{was thus}} forced to select Boston College. Boston College players and fans, {{owing to the}} {{decreased}} status of the Champs Sports Bowl {{when compared with the}} Orange, Chick-fil-A, and Gator Bowls, were disappointed with the selection and match against Michigan State. Had Boston College won the ACC Championship Game, it would have earned the automatic bid to the Orange Bowl, and Virginia Tech would have been selected by the Chick-fil-A Bowl, which had earlier expressed an interest in inviting the Hokies to the game for a second straight year. Clemson would have been <b>bumped</b> down to the Gator Bowl, and Virginia would have been forced into the Champs Sports Bowl.|$|E

40|$|IUE {{data are}} used to {{investigate}} {{the properties of the}} 2175 A interstellar extinction <b>bump</b> toward 45 reddened Milky Way stars. Using analytic fitting functions, parameters are derived which describe the central position, FWHM, and strength of the <b>bump.</b> The <b>bump</b> position is very stable, with an extreme deviation which is still significantly larger than the measurement uncertainty, indicating true variability. The <b>bump</b> FWHM has a large range of intrinsic values, 0. 77 /micron to 1. 25 /micron. The normalized <b>bump</b> strength varies by more than a factor of three. There are no convincing correlations among the three <b>bump</b> parameters, but the width of the <b>bump</b> is strongly correlated with the dust grain environments. Dense quiescent regions yield broad <b>bumps,</b> while diffuse interstellar medium and regions of recent star formation yield narrower <b>bumps.</b> The absence of any correlation between <b>bump</b> width and central position argues strongly against graphite grains in the size range prescribed by the Mathis, Rumpl, and Nordsieck (1977) model as carriers of the <b>bump...</b>|$|R
