40|$|To {{inform the}} design of {{groupware}} technologies such as those for <b>cooperative</b> <b>buildings,</b> we investigated the work habits of teams that collaborate in dedicated project rooms. We conducted field work that included interviews of teams in 9 U. S. companies who had dedicated project rooms and a 6 week observation of one site. In our study, team members using dedicated project rooms reported clear advantages: increased learning, motivation, and coordination. Our findings suggest that <b>cooperative</b> <b>buildings</b> need to support important features of collocated teamwork such as flexible shared visual displays and awareness of team members' activities.

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{contacts between}} Israel and Tunisia {{took place at}} the United Nations in New York in 1951-1952, when Tunisian representatives approached the Israeli delegation and Israeli labor leaders. In June 1952, Bahi Ladgam, a close confident of Habib Bourguiba, met with Gideon Rafael seeking support for Tunisian independence. Bourguiba stated that he would not seek Israel's elimination and would work to promote peace in the region. In 1956, after Tunisia declared independence, he met secretly with Ya'akov Tzur, Israel's ambassador to France. Later that year, Tsur met with the Tunisian finance minister, who sought Israel's assistance in <b>building</b> <b>cooperative</b> agricultural settlements.|$|E
50|$|The FEBs are {{models for}} partnership-based government. The Boards {{serve as a}} vital link to {{intergovernmental}} coordination identifying common ground and <b>building</b> <b>cooperative</b> relationships. FEBs also {{have a long history}} of establishing and maintaining valuable communication links to prepare for and respond to local and national emergencies. While promoting issues related to Administration initiatives, they provide targeted training programs, employee development, shared resources, and local community outreach and participation. The Board’s role as a conduit of information and a meeting point for a variety of agencies—each with a different mission—is critical to a more effective government. FEBs promote awareness of the Federal Government’s involvement in, and contribution to, communities across the country.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, the Public Welfare {{department}} {{of the state of}} Illinois proposed that the University of Illinois develop a program for training in social administration, similar to the programs developed at schools such as the University of Wisconsin, the University of Iowa, and Northwestern University. But by 1941, a portion of the Illinois program (along with other schools’ programs) had to be discontinued due to the strain of the war on the University and its students.The University then hired a consultant from the American Association of the Schools of Social Work to examine the possibility of creating a social work school. The Association suggested that for a school of social work to be successful, a full-time director, trained in the field of social work, was needed.Marietta Stevenson, with a PhD in political science and experience working for the American Public Welfare Association, arrived in 1943 to head the University’s new social work division. Stevenson eventually renamed the program the School of Social Work, and dedicated herself to <b>building</b> <b>cooperative</b> relationships with social work agencies in order to provide fieldwork placement for students. She even held classes at Chicago’s Navy Pier so students could work in field placements in the city’s more urban setting.|$|E

They claim that [...] "only one, Secstiglia, is fully collectivized....Ten others are only half socialized." [...] They study the biggest village, Graus, which they claim {{is more like a}} city than a village. 40% of the working population is engaged in commerce. The family wage was instituted to ensure equal wages for all. At first pesetas were used, but then coupons were instead. Many smaller distribution centers consolidated and were given a new up-to-date <b>building.</b> <b>Cooperative</b> communal markets replaced privately owned retail shops. A larger clothing center replaced 23 out of 25 small shops. 30 privately owned retail food shops were consolidated into one food market. Four bakeries and bread depots were consolidated into one. There was no forced collectivization. Membership was entirely voluntary. Once the government required a municipal council, there were four councilmen form the CNT and four from the UGT. The mayor's post was mostly ceremonial. 90% of all production including exchange and distribution was collectively owned. Each workplace would elect a delegate that would maintain relations with the Labor secretariat.|$|E
