50|$|Fishing {{is popular}} as a {{sideline}} by farmers who supplement their farm produce with fish from freshwater rivers, lakes, and ponds.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to assess colour {{inheritance}} in Showa tricolour variety of koi <b>carp</b> (<b>black</b> basis, white and red signs). Fish of the same colouration were pair-mated. Colouration of fingerlings was assessed in one day age. Colouration was observed in two forms, like melanin pigmentation and non-melanin pigmentation (black- pigmented and gold -pigmented fingerlings). In the tests, gynogenesis was employed, transmissing only mother`s genome to offspring. Gynogenesis was practiced in RIFCH USB in Vodnany. Gynogenetic offspring was further photographically documented to assess colouration of fingerlings and relationship between both variants of colouration. Fry from propagation was bred in ponds to the size stage of advanced fry (Kr; 90 -day old, size 5 - 6 cm). In this size, fingerlings were caught from breeding ponds, counted and further documented to check phenotype segregation...|$|R

40|$|Growth {{rates of}} fish may vary in {{response}} to changing environmental conditions and presence of aquatic nuisance species (ANS). Two ANS, common carp and zebra mussels, are present in Clear Lake, Iowa, and may affect growth rates of fish along with other environmental factors. We (1) documented annual growth rates of four fish species {{in their first year}} of life and at maturity in Clear Lake, (2) examined relationships of growth with environmental factors, and (3) compared contemporary growth to previous studies. Age- 0 <b>black</b> bullhead, common <b>carp,</b> walleye and yellow bass showed a significant, positive relationship with common carp commercial harvest in the previous year and annual number of degree days where water was above 5 oC. Chlorophyll a concentration showed a positive relationship with age- 0 growth of common carp and yellow bass. Age- 0 black bullhead growth was positively related with zooplankton concentration and common carp and yellow bass were negatively related. We saw no significant relationships between environmental variables and annual growth at length-at-maturity. Black bullheads grew similarly in 1955 and this study, but showed slower growth in 1999. Common carp were growing substantially faster in 1952 than in 1999 and the present. Walleye mean length-at-age data collected in this study was similar to the mean length-at-age data recorded in the two historical studies. In the 19402 ̆ 7 s, yellow bass were growing substantially faster than in the 19602 ̆ 7 s and currently.
