40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{mathematical model}} has been developed to simulate the gas flow, composition, and temperature profiles inside a cupola. Comparison of the model with the reported experimental data shows {{the presence of a}} zone with low combustion rate at the tuyere level. For a 24 in (610 mm) cupola with four rows of tuyeres, the combustion zones from each tuyere overlap each other, forming an overall combustion zone of cylindrical shape of height similar to 0. 2 m. Using the model, it is found that the spout temperature initially increases with increasing <b>blast</b> <b>velocity</b> and attains a maximum. Further increase in <b>blast</b> <b>velocity</b> does not change the spout temperature. This suggests that smaller size tuyeres and higher permeability of the bed can give superior cupola performance. (C) 1997 The Institute of Materials...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} a gas flow field {{on the size of}} raceway has been studied {{experimentally}} using a two-dimensional (2 -D) cold model. It is observed that as the <b>blast</b> <b>velocity</b> from the tuyere increases, raceway size increases, and when the <b>blast</b> <b>velocity</b> is decreased from its highest value, raceway size does not change much until the velocity reaches a critical velocity. Below the critical velocity, raceway size decreases with decreasing velocity but is always larger than that for the same velocity when the velocity increased. This phenomenon is called "raceway hysteresis. " Raceway hysteresis has been studied in the presence of different gas flow rates and different particle densities. Raceway hysteresis has been observed in all the experiments. The effect of liquid flow, with various superficial velocities, on raceway hysteresis has also been studied. A study of raceway size hysteresis shows that interparticle and particle-wall friction have a very large effect on raceway size. A hypothesis has been proposed to describe the hysteresis phenomenon in the packed beds. The relevance of hysteresis to blast furnace raceways has been discussed. Existing literature correlations for raceway size ignore the frictional effects. Therefore, their applicability to the ironmaking blast furnace is questionable...|$|E

40|$|We use the Chandra X-ray Observatory {{to analyze}} {{interactions}} {{of the blast}} wave and the inhomogeneous interstellar medium on the western limb of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant. This field of view includes an initial interaction between the blast wave and a large cloud, {{as well as the}} encounter of the shock front and the shell that surrounds the cavity of the supernova progenitor. Uniquely, the X-rays directly trace the shock front in the dense cloud, where we measure temperature kT = 0. 03 keV. We find kT ≈ 0. 2 keV in regions where reflected shocks further heat previously-shocked material. Applying onedimensional models to these interactions, we determine the original <b>blast</b> wave <b>velocity</b> vbw ≈ 330 km s − 1 in the ambient medium.

Through comparison in vibration velocity, contour surface of rock mass excavation, and the crushing extent of excavated rock mass between calculation result and field monitoring, optimum linear charging density of blast hole is determined. Studies are also conducted on rock mass vibration in moderate or far distance to blasting source, the damage of surrounding rock in near-field to blasting source, and crushing degree of excavated rock mass under various in situ stress conditions.

40|$|In shock {{precursors}} {{populated by}} accelerated cosmic rays (CR), the CR return current instability {{is believed to}} significantly enhance the pre-shock perturbations of magnetic field. We have obtained fully-nonlinear exact ideal MHD solutions supported by the CR return current. The solutions occur as localized spikes of circularly polarized Alfven envelopes (solitons, or breathers). As the conventional (undriven) solitons, the obtained magnetic spikes propagate at a speed C proportional to their amplitude, C=C_AB_ max/√(2) B_ 0. The sufficiently strong solitons run thus ahead of the main shock and stand in the precursor, being supported by the return current. This property of the nonlinear solutions is strikingly different from the linear theory that predicts non-propagating (that is, convected downstream) circularly polarized waves. The nonlinear solutions may come either in isolated pulses (solitons) or in soliton-trains (cnoidal waves). The morphological similarity of such quasi-periodic soliton chains with recently observed X-ray stripes in Tycho supernova remnant (SNR) is briefly discussed. The magnetic field amplification determined by the suggested saturation process is obtained {{as a function of}} decreasing SNR <b>blast</b> wave <b>velocity</b> during its evolution from the ejecta-dominated to the Sedov-Taylor stage.

40|$|We analyze {{observations}} from the Chandra X-ray Observatory {{of the southeast}} knot of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant. In this region, the blast wave propagates through an inhomogeneous environment. Extrinsic differences and subsequent multiple projections {{along the line of}} sight rather than intrinsic shock variations, such as fluid instabilities, account for the apparent complexity of the images. Interactions between the supernova blast wave and density enhancements of a large interstellar cloud can produce the morphological and spectral characteristics. Most of the X-ray flux arises in such interactions, not in the diffuse interior of the supernova remnant. Additional observations at optical and radio wavelengths support this account of the existing interstellar medium and its role in shaping the Cygnus Loop, and they demonstrate that the southeast knot is not a small cloud that the blast wave has engulfed. These data are consistent with rapid equilibration of electron and ion temperatures behind the shock front, and the current <b>blast</b> wave <b>velocity</b> v_{bw} approx 330 km/s.

40|$|Supernova {{remnants}} may exhibit both thermal and nonthermal X-ray emission. Such remnants can {{be distinguished}} by the weakness of their X-ray lines, {{because of the presence}} of a strong nonthermal X-ray continuum. RCW 86 is a remnant with weak lines, resulting in low and peculiar abundances when thermal models alone are used to interpret its X-ray spectrum. This indicates the presence of a strong nonthermal synchrotron continuum. We analyze ASCA X-ray spectra of RCW 86 with the help of both nonequilibrium ionization thermal models and nonthermal synchrotron models. A two-temperature thermal model and a simple nonthermal model with an exponential cutoff (plus interstellar absorption) give reasonable results. We obtain <b>blast</b> wave <b>velocity</b> of 800 km s − 1, the shock ionization age of 1 − 3 × 10 11 cm − 3 s, and the break in nonthermal spectra at 2 − 4 × 10 16 Hz.

40|$|During a <b>blasting</b> process, <b>velocities</b> of the {{particles}} {{in the path of}} wave propagation are risen, as a result, the energy left over from a blasting process transmits to the surrounding.

40|$|During the {{construction}} of newly built tunnel (NBT) adjacent to the existing service tunnel (EST), stability of the EST with small interval is affected by vibration waves which are caused by blasting load. The support structures of the EST will be cracked and damaged, while the unreasonable blast-excavation methods are adopted. Presently, the studies on behavior of support structure in the EST under blasting load are not totally clear, especially for the bolts system. Besides, the responses of support structure on blasting load are lacking comprehensive research. In this paper, New Zuofang tunnel is taken as a study case to study the influence of step blast-excavation in NBT on support structures of the EST through field experiment and numerical simulation.

40|$|Tomco Equipment Company {{has participated}} in the dry ice (solid carbon dioxide, CO 2) {{cleaning}} industry for over ten years as {{a pioneer in the}} manufacturer of high density, dry ice cleaning pellet production equipment. For over four years Tomco high density pelletizers have been available to the dry ice cleaning industry. Approximately one year ago Tomco introduced the DI- 250, a new dry ice blast unit making Tomco a single source supplier for sublimable media, particle blast, cleaning systems. This new blast unit is an all pneumatic, single discharge hose device. It meters the insertion of 1 / 8 inch diameter (or smaller), high density, dry ice pellets into a high pressure, propellant gas stream. The dry ice and propellant streams are controlled and mixed from the blast cabinet. From there the mixture is transported to the nozzle where the pellets are accelerated to an appropriate <b>blasting</b> <b>velocity.</b> When directed to impact upon a target area, these dry ice pellets have sufficient energy to effectively remove most surface coatings through dry, abrasive contact. The meta-stable, dry ice pellets used for CO 2 cleaning, while labeled 'high density,' are less dense than alternate, abrasive, particle blast media. In addition, after contacting the target surface, they return to their equilibrium condition: a superheated gas state. Most currently used grit blasting media are silicon dioxide based, which possess a sharp tetrahedral molecular structure. Silicon dioxide crystal structures will always produce smaller sharp-edged replicas of the original crystal upon fracture. Larger, softer dry ice pellets do not share the same sharp-edged crystalline structures as their non-sublimable counterparts when broken. In fact, upon contact with the target surface, dry ice pellets will plastically deform and break apart. As such, dry ice cleaning is less harmful to sensitive substrates, workers and the environment than chemical or abrasive cleaning systems. Dry ice cleaning system components include: a dry ice pellet supply, a non-reactive propellant gas source, a pellet and propellant metering device, and a media transport and acceleration hose and nozzle arrangement. Dry ice cleaning system operating parameters include: choice of propellant gas, its pressure and temperature, dry ice mass flow rate, dry ice pellet size and shape, and acceleration nozzle configuration. These parameters may be modified to fit different applications. The growth of the dry ice cleaning industry will depend upon timely data acquisition of the effects that independent changes in these parameters have on cleaning rates, with respect to different surface coating and substrate combinations. With this data, optimization of cleaning rates for particular applications will be possible. The analysis of the applicable range of modulation of these parameters, within system component mechanical constraints, has just begun...|$|R

The prominent X-ray bright ring of material {{may be the result of}} the reverse shock encountering ejecta; the radial variation of O VII vs. O VIII emission indicates an ionizing shock propagating inwards, possibly through a strong density gradient in the ejecta. We compare the X-ray emission to Australia Telescope Compact Array 6 cm radio observations (Amy and Ball 1993) and to archival Hubble Space Telescope [O III] observations. The ring of radio emission is predominantly inwards of the outer blast wave, consistent with an interpretation as synchrotron radiation originating behind the blast wave, but outwards of the bright X-ray ring of emission.

We apply non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) models {{to fit the}} ejecta-dominated regions and to identify the blast wave of the supernova explosion.

The expansion rate, 0. 100 +/- 0. 025 percent per yr, and inferred age, ~ 1000 yr, of E 0102. 2 - 7219, from a comparison of X-ray observations spanning 20 years, are fully consistent with previous estimates based on studies of high velocity oxygen-rich optical filaments in the remnant. With a radius of 6. 4 pc for the blast wave estimated from the Chandra image, our expansion rate implies a <b>blast</b> wave <b>velocity</b> of ~ 6000 km/s {{and a range of}} electron temperatures 2. 5 - 45 keV, dependent on the degree of collisionless electron heating. Analysis of the Chandra ACIS spectrum of the immediate post-shock region reveals a thermal plasma with abundances and column density typical of the Small Magellanic Cloud and an electron temperature of 0. 4 - 1 keV. The measured electron temperature is significantly lower than the plausible range above, which can only be reconciled if we assume that a significant fraction of the shock energy, rather than contributing to the heating of the post-shock electrons and ions, has gone into generating cosmic rays.

40|$|We {{present a}} study of the {{intermediate}} regime between ultra-relativistic and nonrelativistic flow for gamma-ray burst afterglows. The hydrodynamics of spherically symmetric blast waves is numerically calculated using the AMRVAC adaptive mesh refinement code. Spectra and light curves are calculated using a separate radiation code that, for the first time, links a parametrisation of the microphysics of shock acceleration, synchrotron self-absorption and electron cooling to a high-performance hydrodynamics simulation. For the dynamics we find that the transition to the nonrelativistic regime generally occurs later than expected, that the Sedov-Taylor solution overpredicts the late time blast wave radius and that the analytical formula for the <b>blast</b> wave <b>velocity</b> from Huang (1999) overpredicts the late time velocity by a factor 4 / 3. For the radiation we find that the flux may differ up to an order of magnitude depending on the equation of state that is used for the fluid and that the counterjet leads to a clear rebrightening at late times for hard-edged jets. Simulating GRB 030329 using predictions for its physical parameters from the literature leads to spectra and light curves that may differ significantly from the actual data, emphasizing the need for very accurate modelling. Predicted light curves at low radio frequencies for a hard-edged jet model of GRB 030329 with opening angle 22 degrees show typically two distinct peaks, due to the combined effect of jet break, non relativistic break and counterjet.

This paper presents the first ever numerical and experimental study on commonly used high-strength steel spiral strand cables subjected to high velocity fragment impact. Spiral strand cables were impacted by 20 mm fragment simulating projectiles travelling at velocities between 200 and 1400 m/s.

Methods The local ethical committee approved the study. 13 healthy volunteers were scanned at both 1. 5 T and 3 T in random order with 2 D-flow of the aorta and main pulmonary artery and two 4 D-flow sequences of the heart accelerated with SENSE and k-t BLAST respectively. 2 D-image planes were reconstructed at the aortic and pulmonary outflow.

40|$|Concrete, {{the second}} most used {{material}} on the planet, is a multi-scale heterogeneous material. A fundamental component known as Calcium-Silicate-Hydrate which forms from the reaction between cement and water is the binding phase in concrete. Curiously, this is the least understood component of concrete because of its porous amorphous structure. Further, beyond mere scientific curiosity, cementS̆s industry large carbon footprint due to its volume of usage sets up a practical context to seek improvements in concrete performance and equip concrete with additional functionalities. It is our contention that we can better understand the least known and crucial component of concrete, Calcium-Silicate-Hydrate, to inform the design of next generation of high performance concrete. With this broad theme, this thesis presents three different aspects of properties of Calcium Silicate Hydrate: chemomechanical correlations, behavior under extreme temperature and pressures, and kinetics and nanostructure of in-situ formation. Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) formed in-situ in concrete {{is believed to have}} a layered structure with silicate chains similar to crystal structures of Tobermorite and Jennite. Its chemical composition, characterized by Ca/Si ratio, must therefore influence its silicate chain structure and thus its mechanical properties. We explore the correlation between CS- H composition and its mechanical properties. By varying chemical composition of cement clinkers and supplementary cementitious materials, water/cement ratios, and hydration temperatures, we prepare cement pastes with different C-S-H of different C/S ratios. We use nanoindentation and X-ray spectroscopy to respectively measure the mechanical properties and composition of C-S-H. We then study the mechanical performance of C-S-H at elevated temperatures. This is relevant in the design of infrastructure that can sustain extreme events such as <b>blasts</b> and high <b>velocity</b> impacts. As a starting point for concrete that would enable such infrastructure, we use ultra high performance concrete (UHPC). We use nanoindentation and X-ray spectroscopy to respectively measure mechanical properties and composition of individual components of UHPC. We compare the composition and properties of C-S-H found in UHPC to that found in ordinary cement pastes (OPC). Our grid nanoindentation experiments also reveal an artifacts created by the incorporation of steel fiber reinforcements in UHPC. We find that steel fiber reinforcements disrupt the perfect packing of constituent materials in UHPC to create capillary porosity at microscale. Further, we study the mechanical properties of C-S-H in concrete specimens subjected to high temperatures of 400 °C and 1000 °C. As a product of the reaction between cement and water, the properties of C-S-H are ultimately controlled by the reaction. To obtain quantitative kinetics, we use time-lapse optical microscopy to study hydration of micron sized monoclinic C₃S particles with in droplets of water of 50 [mu]m. Using Raman spectroscopy, we characterize the hydration product growing inside these droplets. by Deepak Jagannathan. Thesis: S.
