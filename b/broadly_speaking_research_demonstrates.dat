For example, he has published multiple studies examining gender differences in white-collar crime. These studies have shown that women tend to be involved in such crime at much lower rates than men, and than when women are involved in it, their positions tend to be less important and less profitable.|$|R

40|$|About the book: Language {{learning}} strategies {{have been a}} topic of research for roughy three decades. <b>Broadly</b> <b>speaking,</b> that <b>research</b> has focused on classroom tuition, predominantly at secondary level. Incresingly, however, langauge learning occurs in independent settings, whether at a distance on Instituion-Wide Language programmes (IWLPs), or in virutal environments. Success in independent langauge learning is achieved by autonomous individuals with a capacity for self-regulation. Yet we still know relatively little about the specific means they use to learn effectively, whether {{in terms of the}} affective strategies they employ to sustain motivation, the metacognitive strateiges required for planning, monitoring and evaluating their learning, or the specific cognitive strategies applied to difficult learning tasks, This volume discusses and evaluates these methods and addresses key issues for independent learners...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{subject of}} {{multimedia}} synchronization in distributed systems {{has been a}} focus of attention for several years now. <b>Broadly</b> <b>speaking,</b> individual <b>research</b> efforts have tended to concentrate either on tools and abstractions for specifying presentation ordering, or techniques for performing synchronization at run time. A specification combines a set of related data elements with instructions on how they should be presented. Thus, one may wish to indicate sequencing, concurrency, responses to user interaction, etc. Most specification schemes involve some kind of timelines and/or scripts, often stored in conjunction with associated multimedia documents. The use of formal methods for dealing with potentially complex requirements has also been explored. Research into the design of systems to provide run time synchronization has been primarily for streams of continuous media, such as audio and video. The temporal characteristics of continuous media present unique diffic...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between ethnocultural diversity and political culture. The {{first part of the}} study explores the literature on ethnocultural diversity as a sociologically relevant variable, its impact on other structural variables, {{and the way in which}} ethnicity became relevant to the study of political culture. In the second part, the secondary analysis of data provided by a research conducted in Romania in 2003 shows that the relationship which can be established between the explored variables is highly inconsistent with relevant studies from the international literature. The findings are in agreement, however, with the contact theory which asserts that the exposure to diversity has a positive impact on the minority majority relations. <b>Broadly</b> <b>speaking,</b> this <b>research</b> proves that ethnocultural diversity is not necessarily conducive to an environment permeable to extremist views. Due to methodological limitations, the conclusions of the study need to be dealt with precaution...|$|R
40|$|<b>Broadly</b> <b>speaking,</b> {{institutional}} <b>research</b> repositories can {{be split}} {{into three categories}} based {{on the way in}} which they secure content. 1. Passive Repositories, which essentially rely on content drifting in as and when faculty members become aware of the repository for themselves. 2. Incentivised Repositories, which typically have one or more dedicated staff member involved in managing, advocating and developing the repository, as well as supporting faculty members in their engagement with the repository. 3. Mandated Repositories, which encompass all the elements of incentivised repositories, but are also underpinned by an institutional mandate, requiring faculty members to deposit their research. Much debate exists in the literature, on listservs, and in the blogosphere as to whether a successful and sustainable repository can be achieved solely through advocacy, management, and development, or whether this is only likely to happen if an institutional mandate is introduced. A much quoted figure is that a non-mandated repository is only likely to capture around 15...|$|R
40|$|<b>Broadly</b> <b>speaking,</b> my <b>research</b> {{interests}} include {{landscape ecology}} and community ecology in grasslands and urban ecosystems. More specifically, my interests focus on examining how human activity affects the abundance, distribution, {{and behaviors of}} animals by altering the spatial distribution of resources in heterogeneous and dynamic landscapes. The research projects conducted by me and my students typically focus on arthropods and birds, but the focal organism is {{not as important as}} the research question being asked. I also have long-standing interests in habitat selection by Eleodes beetles, odonates (dragonflies and damselflies), scorpions, and various birds. Main Research Projects of the McIntyre Lab Of all the anthropogenic activities that affect organisms, landscape change stemming from land conversion (primarily agriculture and urbanization) is the most intensive and cosmopolitan. This topic is the main focus of my lab. Within this broad category, there are several areas of concentration: Effects of anthropogenic land use on odonates of the playas of the Llan...|$|R
40|$|<b>Broadly</b> <b>speaking,</b> the <b>research</b> {{and design}} of {{coatings}} are generally studied by way of single-track deposits; otherwise, {{the development of a}} coated part entails the understanding of how multi-track welding influences the microstructure and properties of the surface. This study evaluated the effect of track overlap on the microstructure and properties of the CoCrMoSi Tribaloy T 400 alloy coatings produced on AISI 316 L steel substrate. The characterization was performed by scanning electron microscopy, hardness and X-ray diffraction. The correlation between the degree of overlap and performance of the coatings was assessed by wear tests. The single track deposits showed hypoeutectic microstructure as a result of high Iron, Chromium and Nickel content. From the second track on, the chemical composition was displaced back to eutectic and then to hypereutectic with overlap of 25 and 50 %, respectively. The microstructure dictated the hardness of the coatings (527 &# 8211; 701 HV 0. 5) and the lower mass loss rate was measured for hypereutectic with primary Laves phase...|$|R
40|$|<b>Broadly</b> <b>speaking,</b> my <b>research</b> {{interests}} {{lie at the}} intersection of the computer security, privacy, and distributed systems disciplines. In particular, I am interested in systems that facilitate secure interactions across multiple security domains while still preserving each individual’s privacy and autonomy. For my dissertation, I have focused mainly on the systems challenges surrounding the adoption of trust negotiation and other distributed proof approaches to authorization in open computing systems. In these approaches, resources are protected by attribute-based access policies, rather than explicit access control lists. Entities use cryptographic credentials issued by third-party attribute certifiers (e. g., professional organizations, employers, or government bodies) to prove various attributes about themselves and their surrounding environment. Since these attributes might be considered sensitive, they can optionally be protected by release policies placing constraints on the individuals to whom they can be disclosed. As a result, trust negotiation sessions are bilateral and iterative exchanges of policies and credentials capable of developing new trust relationships on-the-fly. My research has addressed gaps between the theoretical models used to reason about trust negotiation protocols and real-life asynchronous distributed systems, and has {{led to the development of}} provably-correct and highly-efficient implementations of trust negotiation system components.

40|$|<b>Broadly</b> <b>speaking,</b> my PhD <b>research</b> project aims {{to provide}} a {{critical}} analysis of the double involvement of individual agency and social structure {{in the production of}} a unique form of cultural resistance – contemporary Australian indigenous rock music. More specifically, it strives to: Elaborate and build upon a growing body of sociological knowledge concerned with cultural resistance and oppositional cultures Emphasise the significance of human agency in mediating progressive social change Analyse the innovative ways in which subordinated minority social groups, in this case indigenous Australians, negotiate ‘bi-culturality’, that is, the interface between indigenous cultures and dominant mainstream Anglo-Australian culture Provide a greater understanding of the significance of contemporary popular music to contemporary Australian indigenous cultures and identity The objective is to present an in depth critical analysis of the innovative ways in which indigenous Australians negotiate and transform elements of mainstream popular culture in an attempt to both resist marginalisation within dominant Anglo-Australian culture and promot...|$|R
40|$|<b>Broadly</b> <b>speaking,</b> my <b>research</b> {{interests}} run {{the breadth}} of combinatorics, from weighted graph packing to preference aggregation for the Major League Baseball draft, with stops at the combinatorial calculation of algebraic invariants (such as Stanley depth), and the relationships between graph expansion and selfish traffic routing. By inclination, {{and as a result}} of my training in the interdisciplinary Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization program 1, my research interests span a large number of combinatorial topics and involve a variety of different collaborators. Going forward, in addition to continuing to expand {{the breadth of}} my research and collaborations, I intend to continue work on three areas in which I have had particular research success; combinatorial Stanley depth of monomial ideals, dimension-like measures for posets, and spectral graph theory and applications. In this section I provide a less technical overview of my efforts in these areas while providing a more detailed summary in the following sections. Since it was introduced, one of the fundamental problems in the study of Stanley depth has been to develop a finite time (not necessarily efficient, just finite) means of calculating the Stanley depth of a given module. Recently, a group of commutative algebraists has made progress on this problem by providing a correspondence between the Stanley depth of monomial ideals and a clas...|$|R
40|$|Participatory action {{research}} (PAR) is {{a rapidly growing}} approach in human geography. PAR has diverse origins {{in different parts of}} the world over the last 70 years and it takes many forms depending on the particular context and issues involved. <b>Broadly</b> <b>speaking,</b> it is <b>research</b> by, with, and for people affected by a particular problem, which takes places in collaboration with academic researchers. It seeks to democratize knowledge production and foster opportunities for empowerment by those involved. Within human geography, it offers a politically engaged means of exploring materialities, emotionalities, and aspects of nonrepresentational experience to inform progressive change. Participatory approaches are not without their critics who argue that these can verge on the tyrannical, reproducing the inequalities they seek to overcome. Yet, PAR has exciting synergies with feminist, post-structural, and postcolonial geographies. These enable engagements with both productive and negative effects of power through attention to language, representation, and subjectivity. The ongoing development and experimentation with a range of participatory methods and techniques continue to inspire new understandings and possibilities for action-oriented research within and beyond the academy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This {{thesis is}} about health {{promotion}} and deals with social inequalities in health. The thesis {{is a case}} study of a project drafted by the Trade Union (Fælles Fagligt Forbund, 3 F). The project “Ulighed i sundhed” (inequality in health) has been developed over the years 2011 to 2013. Through their project material we are able to shed light over the possibilities a union can have in preventing inequalities in Health through the workplace. <b>Broadly</b> <b>speaking</b> our <b>research</b> questions and our main aim with this thesis is to analyze the following: how do the trade union 3 F understand heath and inequalities in health and how do they work with i Our empirical data are based on documents collected by the union. These documents consist of an evaluation report and a report on the experience of the employees who participated in the project. Our empirical material also include the union’s questionnaires concerning health, lifestyle and working environment. We will examine the topic by a constructivist theory of science and this perspective will influence our approach to our thesis. Furthermore, we will in our analysis include theoretical works of Pierre Bourdieu, Kickbusch and SignildVallgårda. Bourdieu’s theory is used to gain a perspective on why inequalities between agents or social groups are created, as well as why social inequality exists at all - which Vallgårda is also used to shed light on. Kickbusch is used to gain a more nuanced understanding of the concept of health. In conclusion, when they work with inequality in health, the trade union 3 F use a fysiological construction of health. Therefore, inequalities in health are considered to be primarily the result of the physical work conditions...|$|R
