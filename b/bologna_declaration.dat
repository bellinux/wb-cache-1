40|$|One of the {{purposes}} of the Bologna Process was to facilitate the construction of a Europe of Knowledge through educational governance, yet it fails to reach its purpose because of several unexplained assumptions that undermine the conceptual standing of the whole project; it is {{the purpose of this paper}} to bring these assumptions to light. A knowledge economy cannot exist without the knowledge workers which were previously formed in educational institutions, therefore the project for a Europe of Knowledge is usually linked with the educational policies especially those affecting the higher education institutions. One such policy area is the Bologna Process which explicitly traces its purpose to the construction of an educational system that will facilitate the smooth delivery of employable graduates to the European labor market. This presentation has two purposes. First to show through a textual analysis of the <b>Bologna</b> ministerial <b>declarations</b> how the subject of higher education is constructed to single out the European citizen, understood in a narrow sense as the employable, mobile and skilled graduate. Second, to show that the notion of citizenship used in the <b>Bologna</b> <b>declarations</b> is ill-construed. Starting from T. H. Marshall’s classical distinction between the three understandings of citizenship (civic, political, and social), this paper will show that the Bologna discourse on citizenship borrows and mixes illegitimately from the three notions, without making it explicit why such a hybrid notion of citizenship is used in the first place. status: publishe...|$|R

The Process {{is based on the}} non-binding Sorbonne and <b>Bologna</b> <b>Declarations,</b> and {{is a powerful}} follow-up process consisting of regular Ministerial Conferences and in-between follow-up meetings. In this sense, the Bologna Process is an important de-nationalisation of higher education. However, the strictly inter-governmental Process takes place outside the institutional framework of the European Union, even though all the EU Member States take part. Also the framework of the Council of Europe has been avoided. This exclusion of the European Organisations is remarkable, especially considering the large overlap between {{the subject matter of the}} Bologna Process and their activities. Most notably, the Bologna Process deals with diploma and study credit recognition, student and teacher mobility, research, lifelong learning, quality assurance and a European dimension in higher education, which are all well-established fields of activity of both the EU and the Council of Europe. In this way, it is argued, Bologna detracts from the large body of EU higher education law, and the – often underestimated – legal competence of the EU in higher education. Therefore, the Bologna Process can also be considered as a re-nationalisation of higher education. The Bologna Process is controversial. Some consider Bologna to be a great success, as it has spurred an overwhelming amount of (legislative) changes in almost all European countries through voluntary convergence, whereas others oppose it for precisely this reason. This thesis provides a legal analysis of the Sorbonne and <b>Bologna</b> <b>Declarations</b> and the ensuing Process. From a European law perspective, there are several grave concerns about the way the Bologna Process was created and how it is currently operated. Using the option of operating within the EU framework, most particularly the option of a Bologna Directive, as a comparison, it is argued that with the Bologna Process the Member States have chosen to harmonise their higher education system by less accountable, less transparent, less democratic and less effective means. This is why the Bologna Process amounts to harmonisation by stealth...|$|R

A more integrated European Higher Education Market enhanced competition between European universities—a necessary condition for producing leading-edge innovations and for catching up with the US economy.

40|$|This paper aims to readdress {{the lack}} of {{empirical}} data concerning university learning {{and in particular the}} dynamics students’ conceptions of learning may have on students’ learning outcomes. This paper is written {{at a time when the}} EU commission for Higher Education (HE) through the <b>Bologna</b> Process <b>declaration</b> has put into action, since 1999, a series of reforms needed to make European Higher Education compatible, efficient and competitive for students and academics alike. One of the reforms was the development of learning outcomes in the form of the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS). As part of the process the European universities require to identify and describe the learning outcomes a student is supposed to achieve, in a particular course. The learning outcomes are, now, expected to be clearly specified in all the university course syllabuses. The main argument stated within this paper is that the design of effective learning outcomes, such as the ECTS, especially for curriculum development, cannot be successfully achieved in the absence of the students’ own experience of how they conceive learning to be, including the methods (approaches) they use for learning. Thus, the first aim of this investigation is to analyse the students’ conceptions of learning and the second aim is to examine, through prior research evidence, the effects these conceptions may have on learning approaches and specifically on learning outcomes. Drawing on a 2007 study of Cypriot students’ conceptions of learning, this paper discusses the possibility of a relation between these issues and outlines the importance of taking them into consideration when exploring learning outcomes, curriculum and syllabus design and the professional development of faculty.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether nursing students become more aware of cultural differences and are able to care in a more culturally competent manner, having taken the opportunity to work abroad during their nursing programme. Third year students are offered the chance to undertake an overseas placement supported by sponsorship from the School. Methods: A qualitative approach for data collection was used with focus groups interviews. Ethical approval was successfully received from the University. Anonymity was guaranteed with all participants. Data was analysed using a thematic and content analysis approach Results: Preliminary analysis of the data has identified the following themes: • Cultural differences • Cultural sensitivity • Cultural awareness • Critical thinking • Problem Solving • Personal development Evaluated data has highlighted students feel better prepared to and appreciate the diverse nature of caring in an ever changing health care environment. Discussion: Statements from the European Union advocate mobility of the future workforce, language acquisition, employability and a consistent qualifications system throughout the European Union. The ICN (2007) stated that curricula must be planned in relation to total health needs and resources of the target population and their social and cultural background. This initiative provides students with the opportunity to understand the needs of a diverse population and to develop understanding and communication skills that may be utilised in the health care arenas both nationally and internationally. Conclusions: Supporting the students to undertake an overseas placement develops their cultural sensitivity and competence in caring for individuals in a multi cultural society that promotes understanding of the needs of communities. Additionally it promotes personal and professional development of the students developing their problem solving and critical thinking skills ensuring that on registration they are ‘fit for practice’ within health care.

40|$|This {{discussion}} paper {{deals with the}} social selectivity of internationally mobile German students prior to and after the Bologna Process thereby linking two mobility dimensions that a very rarely brought together - social and spatial mobility. Tackling this issue on multiple levels, I ask how student mobility is understood within key <b>Bologna</b> documents (<b>declarations</b> and communiqu 9 s) and how this {{is related to the}} social selectivity of international mobility among university students in Germany before and after the begin of the Bologna process (1998 / 99). At the European level, I examine the Bologna model of mobility as it is presented within central documents of the Bologna Process using a theory-guided qualitative content analysis. Sociological Neo-Institutionalism serves as theoretical and analytical framework to investigate institutional facilitators and barriers to the diffusion of the mobility model to the national and individual levels. Afterwards, I contextualize the German higher education system and describe the specific reception and translation of the Bologna model of mobility by German actors in higher education. At the individual level, Bourdieu's theory of educational reproduction is applied to the case of international student mobility to explain the socially stratified mobility behavior of German students with regard to the decision to go abroad, the country of destination and the duration of a study-related stay abroad. Further, I analyze the impact of the Bologna Process using survey data provided by the German National Association of Student Affairs (Deutsches Studentenwerk) of two cohorts: pre-Bologna (1997) and post-Bologna (2006). The main findings suggest that the social background of students is especially important {{when it comes to the}} decision to go abroad. However, if students have broken through the first obstacle and decided to go abroad, the influence of the social origin on the country of destination and the duration of mobile periods declines. The correlation between social origin and international mobility has, thus far, not weakened over the course of the Bologna Process. Rather, it has increased over time, indicating an incomplete diffusion in Germany of the relatively vague contents of the Bologna model of mobility from the European to the individual level. This result suggests that the Bologna process goals of enhanced spatial and social mobility have not (yet) been achieved. Dieses Discussion Paper behandelt die soziale Selektivit 4 t internationaler Mobilit 4 t deutscher Studierender im Bologna-Prozess und versucht, dabei zwei Mobilit 4 tsdimensionen zu verbinden, die so bisher nur selten kombiniert wurden: r 4 umliche und soziale Mobilit 4 t.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to asses to what extent there has been an emergence of an organizational field on the European level related to the European Higher Education Area (EHEA), by investigating the scope of and mechanisms behind institutional isomorphism and policy convergence amongst organizations representing stakeholder interests within the EHEA. The organizations in focus – the European University Association (EUA), the European Association of Institutions in Higher Education (EURASHE), the European Students’ Union (ESU), the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education (ENQA), the Education International (EI-ETUC) and BusinessEurope – all claim to be representative of specific interest on the European level (see below) and were recognized within the Bologna Process as relevant partners, by being granted consultative status within the Bologna Follow-Up Group (BFUG). In a situation in which national higher education policies as well as organizational responses and strategies are increasingly shaped by multi-level multi-actor governance arrangements (Maassen & Olsen, 2007; Piattoni, 2010), analysing policies of organizations that operate on the European level and which represent the new actors in higher education governance is of increasing importance. Moreover, these organizations seem to exert a considerable influence over European policy processes (Elken & Vukasovic, forthcoming in 2014), but so far have not been the object of systematic research. The basic idea {{of this study is to}} combine two strands of literature, one focusing on institutional isomorphisms and the other focusing on policy convergence, into an analytical framework suitable for exploring similarities and differences between policies of European stakeholder organizations. Institutional isomorphism literature provides the basis for analysing both organizational and field level dynamics, as well as mechanisms behind isomorphic processes, it does not provide clear guidelines about “indicators that one must use to measure homogeneity [isomorphism]” (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983, p. 156). However, more recent interpretations highlight the difference between convergence (actual isomorphism) and surface compliance (allomorphism) (Ashworth, Boyne, & Delbridge, 2009; Vaira, 2004). Furthermore, literature on policy convergence makes a useful distinction between convergence towards each other (sigma convergence) and convergence towards a model (delta convergence, Heinze & Knill, 2008), as well as highlights the difference between, amongst other, convergence of discourse and of decisions (Pollitt, 2002). The downside of that strand is that it primarily focuses on cross-national and not on inter-organizational phenomena. Thus, while the convergence literature fills the gap in isomorphism literature with regards to operationalization of the key concept (convergence/isomorphism), the isomorphism literature provides necessary elements for analysing inter-organizational dynamic and emergence of an organizational field. A full analytical framework, including the adaptation of the proposition/hypotheses formulated in DiMaggio and Powell (1983) and Heinze and Knill (2008), to fit the context of the EHEA and the specificities of the European stakeholder organizations, will be elaborated in the study. Here only three important elements will be presented: (1) the linkage between policy convergence and institutional isomorphism, (2) their preliminary operationalization, and (3) expectations about the type of isomorphism/convergence. While most of the institutional isomorphism studies focus on (formal) structural aspects of organizations, the initial work actually referred to “homogeneity in structure, culture, and output” (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983, p. 147, emphasis added). The point of departure of this study is that organization’s policy positions, public statements, declarations etc. constitute an indication of its culture and, in particular in the case of a stakeholder organization tasked with representing interest of its constituencies, its key output. In turn, the extent of homogeneity of such output constitutes an indication of an existing organizational field. Moreover, such policy convergence may be even considered as a much stronger indication of an existing organizational field than structural isomorphism, given that “structural changes are observable, whereas changes in policy and strategy are less easily noticed” (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983, p. 152), i. e. structural isomorphism may be more an indication of superficial compliance than actual convergence/isomorphism. The proximity of the two concepts – policy convergence and isomorphism – has been identified already by Knill (2005), though he points out a slight difference with regards to empirical focus: national policies vs. organizational characteristics. In this study the treatment of convergence and isomorphism as synonyms is warranted by the fact that stakeholder organizations have policies of their own, and, as already indicated, these policies are their key output, i. e. their key organizational feature. A two-step operationalization of policy convergence/isomorphism is envisaged: (1) increasing similarity of issues addressed by stakeholder organizations and (2) increasing similarity of specific organizational preferences related to these issues. Organizing the analysis in these two steps allows for an assessment of the extent of structuration of the EHEA organizational field. Stakeholder organizations, by virtue of their different constituencies, can be expected to overlap only slightly with regards to issues they address: e. g. students focus more on access/affordability, HEIs more on funding/institutional autonomy, staff more on individual academic freedom. Even if they address the same issues, it can be expected they would have different preferences concerning these issues, e. g. students want to decrease/abolish tuition fees, while HEIs want to increase/introduce them. Thus, while increasing similarity of issues addressed can be considered as an indication of initial structuration of the field, increasing similarity of specific policy preferences regarding these issues is an indication of an even more intense structuration. Finally, with regards to mechanisms that drive convergence/isomorphism, given the characteristics of both the EHEA and the stakeholder organizations that are in the focus of this study, primarily normative and coercive forms can be expected. The meetings of the BFUG, Bologna seminars and conferences provide ample opportunities for socialization of actors. Even though one cannot speak of an emerging profession in the way that was postulated for normative isomorphism, there is nevertheless a shared cognitive base and networks that span organizations, through cooperation in projects and transfer of staff (Elken & Vukasovic, forthcoming in 2014). Furthermore, while these organizations have been recognized as representatives, they nevertheless need to continuously demonstrate their political relevance and legitimacy by following the agenda set by the EC and the national governments, as well as by following the priorities of the EC funding programmes, both of which add a coercive pressure. Simplified, the study posits that sigma convergence (towards each other) would be indicative of normative isomorphism, while delta convergence (towards a model) will be indicative of coercive isomorphism (this will be elaborated in more detail in the full paper). The organizations selected to be the focus of the study (a) are operating on the European level, (b) have been given the mandate by their members to represent their interests on the European level (as expressed in their statutes, founding documents etc.), and (c) were recognized as representative by national governments participating in the Bologna Process, or EU institutions (including the EC). The organizations are different with regards to constituencies they represent: EUA and EURASHE represent HEIs, ESU students, EI-ETUC academic staff, ENQA quality assurance agencies and BusinessEurope employers (or their associations). Given the difference in their constituencies as well as their different origins, these organizations may have divergent or conflicting preferences, both in terms of issues of interest and in terms of different preferences concerning specific issues. Therefore, they can be seen as less-likely cases of policy convergence/isomorphism. The study is designed as a qualitative comparative study. The key sources of data are various policy documents of the selected organizations: declarations, policy papers, statements etc., available online or through organizational archives. The period under analysis starts with 1998 (the beginning of the Bologna Process) until the most recent policies available. Through content analysis of these documents: (1) the issues which the organizations focus on will be mapped for each year and (2) the specific position of organizations on these issues will be identified. Essentially, the comparison will be done both within cases but across time and across cases/organizations but within the same time. This way it will be possible to assess not only the scope of convergence/isomorphism but also the rate of convergence (i. e. the rate of structuration of the organizational field). In addition, a similar mapping will be done using <b>Bologna</b> official statements (<b>declarations</b> and communiqués from ministerial summits) and official EC communication and funding priorities, to establish a “Bologna baseline” and an “EU/EC baseline”. These two baselines are necessary to compare the extent to which there is sigma convergence as opposed to delta convergence, i. e. normative vs. coercive isomorphism. Based on the theoretical and methodological set up of the study outline above, as well as some preliminary analysis of policy documents, both delta and sigma policy convergence are expected to be identified overall, i. e. both coercive and normative isomorphism, though not equally for all organizations under study. E. g. sigma convergence (normative isomorphism) is expected to be more significant between (1) ESU and EI-ETUC (both are essentially trade unions) and (2) EUA and EURASHE (both represent HEIs). While it is too early to provide more specific expectations concerning the overall extent of structuration of the EHEA organizational field, one can speculate about implications of possible findings. E. g. in case of significant structuration, questions concerning wider legitimacy and linkages between different governance levels arise: are the interests of constituents of these organizations still adequately represented, what may be the implications for the implementation process, is there isomorphism/convergence between constituencies of these organizations, etc. ? Thus, this study aims not only to uncover the extent of structuration of the EHEA organizational field and the implications this may have on shifting boundaries between organizations, but also to contribute more generally to the analysis of multi-level multi-actor governance in higher education...|$|R
