5|$|Various {{stories have}} <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>about</b> Bregowine's origins, {{including}} {{that he was}} a nobleman and a continental Saxon who converted to Christianity and came to Canterbury because of the saintly reputation of Theodore of Tarsus. Others say that he owed his elevation to King Æthelbert II of Kent, but all these stories rest on works that were written after the Norman conquest of England in 1066. There are no contemporary records of Bregowine before he was archbishop. It does not appear, however, that he was of Mercian origins like his predecessors Tatwin and Nothhelm.|$|E
5|$|Later {{commenting on}} this source, Maylam {{highlighted}} that its author {{did not appear}} to be from Kent and that, from their use of wording, it appeared that they had <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>about</b> the tradition by locals but had not actually witnessed it first hand. As such, Maylam suggested that the author may have been wrong in describing the use of a horse's skull in the Ramsgate tradition, given that both later sources and the hoodeners of his own time all used a wooden model of a horse's head. At the same time, Maylam noted that the use of a horse's skull was not impossible, for such skulls had also been used in the hobby horse traditions of other parts of Britain.|$|E

25|$|Artemis punished Agamemnon {{after he}} killed a sacred stag in a sacred grove and boasted {{that he was}} a better hunter than the goddess. When the Greek fleet was {{preparing}} at Aulis to depart for Troy to begin the Trojan War, Artemis becalmed the winds.

25|$|In {{a further}} Panorama {{documentary}} broadcast on BBC One on 29 November 2010, Jennings alleged that three senior FIFA officials, Nicolas Leoz, Issa Hayatou and Ricardo Teixeira, {{had been paid}} huge bribes by FIFA's marketing partner ISL between 1989 and 1999, which FIFA had failed to investigate. He claimed they appeared {{on a list of}} 175 bribes paid by ISL, totaling about $100million. A former ISL executive said that there were suspicions within ISL that the company was only awarded the marketing contract for successive World Cups by paying bribes to FIFA officials. The programme also alleged that another current official, Jack Warner, has been repeatedly involved in reselling World Cup tickets to touts; Sepp Blatter said that FIFA had not investigated the allegation because it had not <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>about</b> it via 'official channels'.|$|E
25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>about</b> Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E

Minogue had <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>about</b> the rumours and, as a response, wrote the track [...] "Did It Again". Interviewed by Company magazine that year, she was questioned on her weight and the song, and she explained [...] "It's {{a bit of a}} girl's song, with me telling myself off and never learning my lesson, particularly with men. It's me looking myself in the eye and saying 'You fool, stop being too clever and over-neurotic.'" [...] She had begun writing the song whilst British tabloids published rumors about her private life, and the poor reception that Impossible Princess lead single [...] "Some Kind of Bliss" [...] received. However, she re-wrote the original lyrics with Anderson and Seaman and Minogue said it told a [...] "different meaning". The song discusses telling herself off when she does not learn from her past mistakes. She commented that [...] "Some of the songs from Impossible Princess are close to the heart, but this song was a little voice on my shoulder." [...] The song was originally titled [...] "Clever Girl (Did It Again)".|$|E

500|$|When it {{was decided}} that Billie Piper would leave the series at the end of Series 2, {{executive}} producer and head writer Russell T Davies considered giving her character Rose Tyler her own 90-minute spin-off production, Rose Tyler: Earth Defence, with the possibility of such a special becoming an annual Bank Holiday event. The special would have picked up from Rose's departure in Doomsday in which Rose joins the Torchwood Institute of a parallel Earth. The special was officially commissioned by Peter Fincham, the Controller of BBC One, and assigned a production budget. Davies changed his mind while filming Piper's final scenes for Series 2 of Doctor Who, later calling Earth Defence [...] "a spin-off too far," [...] and deciding that for the audience {{to be able to see}} Rose when the Doctor could not would spoil the ending of Doomsday, and the production was cancelled. Davies said Piper had <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>about</b> the idea, but the project ended before she was formally approached about starring in it. The plot element of Tyler working with Torchwood to defend the earth would be revisited towards the end of Series 4 in 2008.|$|E
500|$|In 1926, {{a letter}} to the editor of the Register asking about the origin of the name Waterloo Bay sparked a lively {{exchange}} between a Register journalist and west coast local Archie Beviss and others. According to Foster et al., Beviss was relying on local hearsay about the massacre, and he is now associated with the [...] "most bloodthirsty versions of the legend". Beviss claimed to have <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>about</b> the massacre by several people, including Hamp's son, as well as James Geharty, one of the police officers involved in investigating the murders. Beviss stated that Hamp's son was a 16-year-old shepherd at the time of his father's murder, and that he had found his father's head in a camp oven, having been cut off with a crosscut saw. According to Beviss, after the murder of Easton, Geharty urged the government to take action, and after approval was given, a force of 160 men was raised. The force then drove about 260 Aboriginal people over the cliffs. Finally, Beviss stated that Geharty named Waterloo Bay after the massacre. Foster et al. have identified several inconsistencies in Beviss' account. Firstly, Geharty did not name Waterloo Bay. Beviss named Easton's husband as being involved in the drive against the Aboriginal people, but James Easton went to Adelaide after his wife's murder and never returned. There is also no evidence that the government sanctioned the raising of a force. Finally, if 160 men participated in the drive, the authors question why no first-hand accounts of the massacre exist.|$|E
