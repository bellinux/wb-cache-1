500|$|Despite Morello, Wilk and Commerford's {{involvement}} in Prophets of Rage, Commerford confirmed {{in an interview}} with Rolling Stone that Rage Against the Machine has not split up, explaining, [...] "We just do things our own way. Throughout our career, we never did what anyone wanted us to do. We never made the records people wanted us to make. We never played by the rules people wanted us to play by. And here we are, 25 years later, still a band. Clearly that means something. And if we did ever play or make new music or anything, {{it would be a very}} big deal. And there's a lot of bands that I've seen come along during that 25-year period that did everything the record companies and the powers-that-be wanted them to do, and they sold millions of records. <b>But</b> <b>where</b> <b>are</b> they now? They're gone." [...] Morello added, [...] "Right now...the cold embers of Rage Against the Machine are now the burning fire of Prophets of Rage. Where Rage Against the Machine lives, is this summer in these songs that we are playing. And we have nothing but the greatest love and honor and respect for Zack de la Rocha, the brilliant lyricist of Rage Against the Machine, who is working on his own music, which I'm sure will be fantasticâ€”he's a great artist in his own right. But where you're going to hear Rage Against the Machine is in Prophets of Rage." ...|$|E
