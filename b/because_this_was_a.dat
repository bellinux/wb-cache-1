25|$|The {{right of}} {{election}} {{was held by}} householders paying scot and lot, a local tax. This {{was one of the}} most democratic franchises used in elections to the Unreformed House of Commons. However <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> small borough, from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was under the patronage of the Drake family of Shardeloes (an estate about a mile from the town).|$|E

When the Cherokee moved their base, so too did John McDonald, now deputy to Thomas Brown, along with his own assistant Daniel Ross, making Running Water the base of operations. Graham's deputy, Alexander Campbell, set up his own base at what became Turkeytown.|$|E

25|$|The Square Water Pavilion, {{also called}} the Queen's Bath, is in the {{south-east}} of the royal centre. It has a pavilion, a water basin and a method of moving fresh water to it and taking away wash water and overflows. The basin is enclosed within an ornate, pillared, vaulted bay. Nearby are ruins of the aqueduct. The modern name of this building, the Queen's bath, is probably a misnomer <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> public bath for men and travellers. The building's interior arches show influence of the Indo-Islamic style, reflecting an era n which Hindu and Muslim arts influenced each other in India.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1968, Kaplan enlisted {{help from}} Dan Byer, a retired {{engineer}} from AMC, {{for the development of}} a new block casting. Using the basic AMC 390 drawings, they added more mass for four-bolt mains and improved the oiling system. A run of 50 blocks was contracted to Central Foundries in Windsor, Ontario. <b>Because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> small run, and there was little factory support, it fell to Kaplan and his staff to clean up the blocks from the sand casting, hone the various passages and, finally, send them to AMC’s “Parts Central” in Kenosha. From there, they could draw on the inventory, as required.|$|E
25|$|The two-story {{main house}} was built by Andres Ximenez (an {{alternate}} spelling of Jimenez), a merchant of Spanish birth who married Juana Pellicer, daughter of Francisco Pellicer, {{a leader of the}} Minorcan community in St. Augustine. The property's modern name references Ximenez as well as the last historic owner of record: Louisa Fatio (FAY-she-oh), who ran the boarding house as Miss Fatio's. Louisa purchased the house in 1855, becoming the last of three successive women owners during its years as a boarding house. Their success contributes to the historical significance of the property, <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> time when few American women owned property in their own names or managed a respectable business.|$|E

25|$|The runoff count took a week, {{handled by}} the Democratic State Central Committee (<b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> party primary). Johnson was finally {{announced}} the winner by 87 votes out of 988,295 cast. The Committee voted to certify Johnson's nomination {{by a majority of}} one (29–28), with the last vote cast on Johnson's behalf by Temple, Texas, publisher Frank W. Mayborn. There were many allegations of voter fraud; one writer alleges that Johnson's campaign manager, future Texas governor John B. Connally, was connected with 202 ballots in Precinct 13 in Jim Wells County where the names had curiously been listed in alphabetical order with the same pen and handwriting, just at the close of polling. Some of these voters insisted that they had not voted that day. Robert Caro argued in his 1989 book that Johnson had thus stolen the election in Jim Wells County, and that 10,000 ballots were also rigged in Bexar County alone. Election judge Luis Salas said in 1977 that he had certified 202 fraudulent ballots for Johnson.|$|E
25|$|The {{first week}} of the 1912 season {{presented}} in conjunction with the Australian impresario J.C. Williamson, at Her Majesty's Theatre, Melbourne, put up a record still unbroken and likely to remain so: four Australian premieres in eight days. The company opened on Saturday, 8 June (having only arrived in the country the previous Wednesday), with a gala premiere of The Tales of Hoffmann, followed on the Monday by the first performance in Australia of the Paris version of Tannhäuser, the Australian premiere of The Girl of the Golden West on the Tuesday, another performance of Hoffmann on the Wednesday, Rigoletto on the Thursday, the Australian premiere of Tristan und Isolde on the Friday, and the Australian premiere of The Prodigal Son by Debussy as part of a double bill with Hänsel und Gretel on the Saturday afternoon, with Hoffmann again that night. This quick start and rate of bringing forward new productions was only possible <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> complete company, with its own chorus and orchestra — the only one to visit Australia — and had already performed all its repertoire in England and South Africa on its way to Australia.|$|E

500|$|<b>Because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{volunteer}} expedition and not {{a regular}} army operation, the men elected their officers. The candidates for the top position were David Williamson, the militia colonel who had commanded the Gnadenhütten expedition, and William Crawford, a retired Continental Army colonel. Crawford, a friend and land agent of George Washington, was an experienced soldier and frontiersman. He was a veteran {{of these kinds of}} operations, having destroyed two Mingo villages during Dunmore's War in 1774. He had also taken part in the failed [...] "squaw campaign".|$|E
500|$|At the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, LaBeouf {{told the}} Los Angeles Times he had [...] "dropped {{the ball on}} the legacy that people loved and cherished" [...] and felt that [...] "the movie could have been updated ... we just misinterpreted {{what we were trying to}} satiate." [...] In 2011, in {{response}} to LaBeouf's comments, Harrison Ford said: [...] "I think I told [...] he was a fucking idiot ... As an actor, I think it's my obligation to support the film without making a complete ass of myself. Shia is ambitious, attentive and talented — and he's learning how to deal with a situation which is very unique and difficult." [...] LaBeouf later regretted his comments and their effect on his relationship with Spielberg: [...] "He told me there's a time to be a human being and have an opinion, and there's a time to sell cars. It brought me freedom, but it also killed my spirits <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> dude I looked up to like a sensei." ...|$|E
2500|$|Justice Breyer {{complained that}} the [...] "real world of {{criminal}} justice" [...] {{would not be able}} to meet the [...] "ideal" [...] of submitting to juries facts that subject criminal defendants to increased punishments. [...] Fixing certain punishments for all defendants convicted of the same offense would ignore specific harms committed by different defendants as well as certain characteristics of individual defendants. [...] "There are, to put it simply, far too many relevant sentencing factors to permit submission of all (or even many) of them to a jury." [...] <b>Because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> premise upon which the Federal Sentencing Guidelines rested, Justice Breyer dissented from the majority's opinion. [...] Yet his opinion for the majority in United States v. Booker, in which he crafted the remedy of severance and excision of the mandatory nature of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, meant that Breyer ultimately prevailed in the sentencing war, even if he had momentarily lost the constitutional battle in Apprendi.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{example is}} Nazarene in : [...] "And {{he came and}} dwelt in a city called Nazareth, {{that it might be}} {{fulfilled}} which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene." [...] The website for Jews for Judaism claims that [...] "Since a Nazarene is a resident of the city of Nazareth and this city did not exist during the time period of the Jewish Bible, it is impossible to find this quotation in the Hebrew Scriptures. It was fabricated." [...] However, one common suggestion is that the New Testament verse is based on a passage relating to Nazirites, either <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> misunderstanding common at the time, or through deliberate re-reading of the term by the early Christians. Another suggestion is [...] "that Matthew was playing on the similarity of the Hebrew word nezer (translated 'Branch' or 'shoot' in [...] and [...] ) with the Greek nazoraios, here translated 'Nazarene.'" [...] Christians also suggest that by using an indirect quotation and the plural term prophets, [...] "Matthew was only saying that by living in Nazareth, Jesus was fulfilling the many Old Testament prophecies that He would be despised and rejected." [...] The background for this is illustrated by Philip's initial response in [...] to the idea that Jesus might be the Messiah: [...] "Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Legislative {{committees}} led by James M. Thomson and John B. Boatwright {{attempted to}} use those new laws against the NAACP and cooperating attorneys. The Boatwright Committee subpoenaed NAACP membership lists, and issued reports in November 1957 and November 1958 accusing NAACP attorneys (including Tucker) of violating these laws and urging the Virginia State Bar to prosecute them. The Boatwright Committee specifically accused Tucker of soliciting [...] "not less than 10 cases involving litigation" [...] and claimed {{that some of his}} plaintiffs were signed up under false pretenses or had not realized they were becoming involved in litigation. Tucker became the only NAACP attorney that the Virginia State Bar attempted to prosecute and disbar for these expanded offenses. That prosecution began in February 1960, and the NAACP sent attorney Robert Ming from Chicago to defend Tucker before the state court in Emporia. The case was repeatedly dismissed without prejudice (allowing prosecutors to re-file), particularly after Commonwealth's attorney Harold Townsend asserted that Tucker had no right to confront or even identify his accusers <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> bar proceeding. The NAACP rallied to Tucker's defense in fighting what it viewed as an attempt to derail legal desegregation in Virginia. It was transferred to Sussex County and finally dismissed in early 1962, although the judges orally reprimanded Tucker for his handling of an estate case. In January 1963 in NAACP v. Button, the NAACP won other cases it had filed to stop enforcement of the last of the newly expanded laws. Furthermore, when in 1987, both Tucker and Oliver Hill received awards from Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell on behalf of the Virginia Commission on Women and Minorities in the Legal System, Tucker alluded to that prosecution and noted that he was now being honored [...] "for the very thing for which I'm being recognized today".|$|E
2500|$|The Los Angeles Times, The Atlantic, Slate, and Time all {{published}} opinion columns {{where the}} writer thought {{the incident was}} not getting as much media coverage as it deserved. Megan McArdle explains that she didn't cover it because it made her ill, but also how being pro-choice influenced writers saying [...] "most of us {{tend to be less}} interested in sick-making stories if the sick-making was done by 'our side,'" [...] saying, [...] "this story should have been covered much more than it was — covered as a national policy issue, not a 'local crime story.'" [...] Martin Baron, The Post’s executive editor, claims he wasn’t aware of the story until Thursday, 11 April, when readers began emailing him about it, saying “I wish I could be conscious of all stories everywhere, but I can’t be". [...] They ultimately decided that, in fact, the story warranted attention because of [...] "the seriousness and scope of the alleged crimes and <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> case that resonated in policy arguments and national politics", adding “In retrospect, we regret not having staffed the trial sooner. But, as you know, we don’t have unlimited resources, and [...] {{there is a lot of}} competition for our staff’s attention". He insisted that “we never decide what to cover for ideological reasons, no matter what critics might claim. [...] Accusations of ideological motives are easy to make, even if they’re not supported by the facts". The New York Times also acknowledged the lack of coverage and reported on the online campaign and subsequent increase in coverage of the case. While Powers' piece clearly sparked debate among journalists, Katherine Bindley also highlights contrasting views, as does Paul Farhi. [...] A column on Salon.com questioned whether the Gosnell case was an example of liberal media bias, saying that conservative media and politicians had also given little attention to the story until April 2013.|$|E

2500|$|The {{priority}} {{system is}} reinforced by a line of case law, whose principle {{is to ensure that}} creditors cannot contract out of the statutory regime. [...] This is sometimes referred to as the [...] "anti-deprivation rule". The general principle, according to the Mellish LJ in Re Jeavons, ex parte Mackay is that [...] "a person cannot make it a part of his contract that, in the event of bankruptcy, he is then to get some additional advantage which prevents the property being distributed under the bankruptcy laws." [...] So in that case, Jeavons made a contract to give Brown & Co an armour plates patent, and in return Jeavons would get royalties. Jeavons also got a loan from Brown & Co. They agreed half the royalties would pay off the loan, but if Jeavons went insolvent, Brown & Co would not have to pay any royalties. The Court of Appeal held half the royalties would still need to be paid, <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> special right for Brown & Co that only arose upon insolvency. In a case where a creditor is owed money by an insolvent company, but also the creditor itself owes a sum to the company, Forster v Wilson held that the creditor may set-off the debt, and only needs to pay the difference. The creditor does not have to pay all its debts to the company, and then wait with other unsecured creditors for an unlikely repayment. However, this depends on the sums for set-off actually being in the creditors' possession. In British Eagle International Air Lines Ltd v Compaigne Nationale Air France, a group of airlines, through the International Air Transport Association had a netting system to deal with all the expenses they incurred to one another efficiently. All paid into a common fund, and then {{at the end of each}} month, the sums were settled at once. British Eagle went insolvent and was a debtor overall to the scheme, but Air France owed it money. Air France claimed it should not have to pay British Eagle, was bound to pay into the netting scheme, and have the sums cleared there. The House of Lords said this would have the effect of evading the insolvency regime. It did not matter that the dominant purpose of the IATA scheme was for good business reasons. It was nevertheless void. Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc observed that the general principle consists of two subrules [...] the anti-deprivation rule (formerly known as [...] "fraud upon the bankruptcy law") and the pari passu rule, which are addressed to different mischiefs [...] and held that, in borderline cases, a commercially sensible transaction entered into in good faith should not be held to infringe the first rule. All these anti-avoidance rules are, however, subject to the very large exception that creditors remain able to jump up the priority queue, through the creation of a security interest.|$|E
