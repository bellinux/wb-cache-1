40|$|Racist and {{cultural}} stereotypes in Australia have been rooted {{in both the}} economic and social environment of the receiving society at the time.

40|$|A recent {{episode of}} 20 / 20, {{entitled}} “The New Sex,” {{focused on the}} supposedly emerging practice of free and non-anonymous sperm donation. The show opens with a portrayal of a married couple, Beth and Richard, who desired to conceive a child together, but could not, because Richard’s vasectomy could not be reversed. After spending fourteen thousand dollars on fertility treatments, {{all of which are}} unsuccessful, the couple turns to the Internet’s Free Sperm Donor Registry to locate a donor who will provide sperm at no cost and without the cloak of anonymity. The rest of the episode, described below, follows the couple as they choose a donor and perform an insemination in a hotel room. It also follows a man who has given away so much sperm that the government has ordered him to cease “manufacture” of it, and a third man who gives away sperm through “natural insemination,” by having sex with women who want to become pregnant. [...] . In this column, I will explore the different arrangements the 20 / 20 episode profiled, and analyze the ways in which parentage law might facilitate or obstruct the intent of the various parties. The <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> that <b>this</b> type of sperm donation falls outside many of the conventional rules governing assisted reproduction. Thus, the women who use the free sperm from a known donor may end up with co-parents they do not want, and the sperm donors may end up with responsibilities they didn’t foresee.

40|$|Psst: here’s {{my secret}} wry suspicion. Political theorists are {{allergic}} to facts. They feel entitled to firm beliefs—about state-building, modernization, {{the rise of}} the bourgeoisie, you name it—because they’ve read some fancy theory books. So a lot of theory reads like a conceptual shell game, with various intoxicating abstractions shuffled about. I’m enough of a vulgar pragmatist to think that theory isn’t what you get when you leave out the facts. So I found Wahrman’s Making of the Modern Self sheer joy, from start to finish. The <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> first: <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a mustread across the humanities and humanistic social sciences, not something solely of interest to cultural historians of Britain’s long eighteenth century. Wahrman’s thesis—that an “ancien régime of identity” abruptly collapsed {{in the face of the}} American Revolution—is juicy enough to make any political theorist smack her lips. But it’s underwritten with a sensational and fascinating array of nitty-gritty facts. (Mischievously, Wahrman sometimes promises, or threatens? the reader that he has plenty more evidence up his sleeve, but confesses, or boasts? that he didn’t think the reader patient enough to endure hearing about it.) And Wahrman shuttles between big picture and tiny detail with consummate confidence. He may be a “historian,” and I may be a “theorist,” but I wish more theorists did what he does. Indeed he presents himself, fairly, as carrying through a project Charles Taylor sketched in his magisterial Sources of the Self but didn’t even attempt to deliver...|$|R

40|$|Increasing public {{awareness}} {{on the environmental}} and social growth has promoted the application of sustainable development in construction. The triple <b>bottom</b> <b>line,</b> namely economy, society and environment is generally recognised as significant dimensions for measuring the performance of sustainability. However, most research often puts their focus on environmental issues, rather than the whole sustainability concept. The implementation of sustainable construction also differs greatly from one practice to another, since its definition and principles are still highly debatable. Additionally, it appears that various standards and certifications in the market do not embrace three pillars – environmental, social and economic sustainability in their assessments either. To incorporate the best value of sustainable construction, {{it is crucial to}} determine the gap between stakeholders’ expectations and actual deliverables of sustainable construction. Therefore, this research aims to explore and determine the maturity status of sustainable development implementation in the current construction industry. The Sustainable Construction Maturity Model (SCMM) is developed to assist construction stakeholders in gaining a richer understanding on the practices of sustainable construction. Pilot interviews were conducted to determine the appropriateness of research methods as well as to validate the SCMM. The research employed in-depth interviews and case studies as principal research methods to develop deeper insights of the development of sustainable construction, by triangulating data sources. A supplement questionnaire survey was also used to have a meta-analysis on the results obtained. The empirical evidence implies that sustainable construction could be practised at two extremes – exceptionally high and low maturity, regardless of sectors. This large gap suggests that the development of sustainable construction are rather diverged and fragmented in the industry. Although social and economic sustainability may not be absolutely excluded, current sustainable practices tend to put more effort on environmental sustainability. A loss of balance in achieving the three pillars may undermine the full potential of realising sustainable construction. Additionally, the research also found that good coordination between stakeholders is required not only during the design and construction stages but also in the post occupancy stage. Building a good sustainability culture could always bring more significant implications on the maturity status of sustainable construction, rather than the built-in high technology facilities in the built environment. To transform the built environment into a holistic sustainable development world, striking a balance of the triple <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> required. <b>This</b> research can steer the construction community to improve their performance in attaining the goals of sustainable construction. The SCMM can also provide an objective and consistent assessment tool to manage sustainable capability and capacity and to position the current performance level. By having {{a better understanding of the}} overall development of sustainable construction, practitioners can shape their future directions and strategies better and, in turn move sustainability performance in construction to a higher level of maturity. Since sustainable construction emphasises long terms development, continual efforts shall be made to achieve sustainability. published_or_final_versionReal Estate and ConstructionDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
