40|$|The {{dynamics}} of oil {{prices in the}} past few years and their vertiginous rise observed during 2008 have captured the attention of academia and governments. This paper proposes an analysis of the petroleum market, making emphasis in the crude benchmarks WTI and Brent, the world reserves distribution, production levels, and the comprehension of the ratio and the mechanisms of the term or future contracts. The attempt at proposing a thorough research needs two types of analysis: fundamental and financial technical. It was found that the causes of the oil price increases are multiple and, among them, the speculative component has probably been the most incisive.

40|$|The {{recent history}} of the {{informal}} market for North Sea <b>Brent</b> <b>blend</b> has been {{of great interest to}} those studying commodity markets in general and the oil market in particular. Two aspects of this market gives it this important position. First, the very rapid growth inactivity in the Brent market means that for much of 1985 an average of at least 400 deals a month were being made. With each deal being for a lot size of 600, 000 barrels of oil at around $ 25 a barrel the total turnover i n 1985 was at least $ 72 billion. The second feature of the market is that it operates as an informal forward market. There is no central clearing agency, as in a futures market, and so each deal is done directly between agents...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{valuation}} and hedging of spread options on two commodity prices {{which in the}} long run are cointegrated. For long term option pricing the spread between the two prices should therefore be modelled directly. This approach offers significant advantages relative to the traditional multi-factor spread option pricing model since the correlation between two asset returns is notoriously hard to model. In this paper, we propose one and two factor models for spot spread processes under both the risk-neutral and market measures. We develop pricing and hedging formulae for options on spot and futures spreads. Two examples of spread options in energy markets—the crack spread between heating oil and WTI crude oil and the location spread between <b>Brent</b> <b>blend</b> and WTI crude oil – are analyzed to illustrate the results.

40|$|The {{dissolution}} of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds and {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} from petroleum phases into water results in groundwater contamination at petroleum contaminated sites. The objective of the research is to investigate whether aging of oil-water interfaces {{and the formation of}} interfacial films retard {{dissolution of}} solutes from petroleum phases. The equilibrium partitioning and mass transfer rates of benzene and naphthalene in oil-water systems were evaluated experimentally. The research demonstrated that: (i) the mass transfer of the solutes from <b>Brent</b> <b>Blend</b> crude oil to water is retarded when the oil-water interface is aged; (ii) visually observable interfacial films are formed between gasoline and water when amended with asphaltenes or asphaltenes and resins; (iii) the mass transfer of solutes from gasoline amended with asphaltenes or asphaltenes and resins decreased by a factor of 2. 3 to 66 between 4 to 35 days of interface aging and (iv) equilibrium partitioning is not significantly affected by amending the gasoline...|$|E
40|$|In {{the thesis}} we discuss changes in {{viscosity}} {{of the oil}} spills in the marine environment. After the spill the following processes occur: evaporation, emulsification, mechanical spreading, dissolution, dispersion, oxidation, sedimentation and biological degradation. Evaporation, emulsification and the environmental factors, the change in temperature and the wind, have the greatest influence in Mackay's methods for calculating the viscosity of the spilled oil. With the three Mackay's empirical equations we can determine the oil viscosity {{at a given time}} after the spill from different input data. Evaporation is calculated according to the Fingas method, based on laboratory experiments and empirical equations wherein dependency of the evaporation from temperature and the time is given. With the newly developed model VISKOZNOST we can simply and quickly calculate the viscosity of several different oil types in given environmental conditions. The application of the model is presented on two types of oil: <b>Brent</b> <b>Blend</b> and Maui. The oil viscosity is an important parameter in oil spill studies and the developed model {{can be used as a}} useful tool in the framework of the teaching process...|$|E
40|$|Evaporation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} processes during an oil spill and needs to be included into the oil spill models. The oil-spill models mostly employ either the Mackay or the Fingas method for description and simulations of evaporation. The Mackay method is a boundary-layer regulated method based on observations of water evaporation. The Fingas approach is not regulated with the boundary layer. NAFTA 3 d is a 3 D Lagrangean numerical model for oil-spill simulations, developed at the UL FGG, The NAFTA 3 d model was upgraded by adjusting the Mackay method, which is now capable to calculate the evaporation solely from the API-index instead of using numerous input parameters. The model was upgraded by including the Fingas method, which is based on laboratory experiments. In this method the evaporation of oil is described by empirical equations, which are function of temperature and time. Both methods have been intercompared on the same set of input data. We simulated an oil spill in the Gulf of Trieste using two different types of oil: the <b>Brent</b> <b>Blend</b> crude and Prudhoe Bay crude. The simulation results showed significantly higher evaporation using the Mackay method, which affects the other process in the case of an oil spill...|$|E
40|$|In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, {{touching}} off an economic, financial, diplomatic, {{and military}} crisis {{associated with a}} tremendous spike in oil prices and recession in OECD and oil-importing developing countries. But was the Gulf Crisis a disruption? Did it affect the fabric of oil trade? To examine this question, this paper examines the changing role of international trade intermediaries (ITIs, {{often referred to as}} “trading companies”) in the oil market. ITIs connect buyers and sellers, serving as the glue that holds many commodity markets together. Oil trading companies have attracted harsh scrutiny form policymakers as a result of allegations regarding their role in the United Nations’ Iraqi Oil-for-Food Program, but minimal scholarly attention. The paper takes advantage of a unique microdatabase on the Brent market. Produced in the U. K. North Sea, <b>Brent</b> <b>Blend</b> {{is by far the most}} widely traded crude oil in the international market. Participants in the Brent market are diverse, with the largest traders falling into two categories. The first comprises “industrial MNEs”—companies active in the business of producing or refining crude oil. The second category comprises financial houses and trading companies. This diversity provides an opportunity to test hypotheses regarding behavioral differences across types of companies and geographic origin, before, during, and after the crisis. oil, trading companies, crisis, Brent, North Sea...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{has studied}} {{efficiency}} in the crude oil futures market for WTI and the <b>Brent</b> <b>Blend</b> {{for a period}} including the “shale oil revolution”. The main objective was to provide new information by investigating a period in time not much explored in already published articles. Furthermore, the thesis sought to close a gap of earlier empirical studies performed, by combining the two crude oil types and including up to 6 months maturities for futures contracts, {{while at the same}} time having a precise definition of an efficient market. The raw data applied was daily closing prices for spot and 1 -, 2 -, 3 -, 4 -, 5 -, and 6 - months (M) futures contracts from January 1986 to March 2016 for WTI and from October 2003 to March 2016 for the <b>Brent</b> <b>Blend.</b> The data was converted to monthly observations, and the Johansen cointegration analysis was performed while imposing the restrictions of the unbiasedness hypothesis, α = 0 and β = 1. Tests were performed pairwise, both for the same blends and across blends. The cointegration analyses were further performed both for the total period and separately for the sub period (January 2012 - March 2016), as the produced amounts of shale oil started its sharp incline in 2012. Finally, tests of weak exogeneity were performed. For the total period, the market was concluded efficient for the cointegration pairs Brent spot/Brent 1 M, WTI spot/WTI 1 M, WTI spot/Brent 3 M, WTI spot/Brent 4 M, WTI spot/Brent 5 M and WTI spot/Brent 6 M. For the sub period, the market was concluded efficient for the pairs Brent spot/Brent 4 M, WTI spot/WTI 2 M, WTI spot/WTI 4 M, WTI spot/WTI 5 M, WTI spot/Brent 2 M, WTI spot/Brent 3 M and WTI spot/Brent 4 M. In general, futures prices were found to have led spot prices for most of the cointegrated pairs. The hypothesis of the spot price leading the futures price was rejected for all cointegrated pairs. For the total period, the finding of efficient markets for the contract with the shortest maturity for WTI and Brent was similar to previous empirical findings. The amount of cointegrated pairs however implied a higher degree of cointegration than previously. There was found little cointegration and no market efficiency for the Brent spot/WTI futures- pairs, implying possible speculation opportunities. The assumption of “normal backwardation” did not seem applicable for the periods investigated, as most relationships showed signs of contango. Suggestions were made that a non-linear method or a method including a structural break might better model the crude oil futures market. Risk-varying premiums, convenience yields and investors with different investment horizons were among the factors discussed as possible explanations to why the unbiasedness hypothesis was rejected in most cases. Finally, the results implied that using crude oil futures as a risk management tool might not be efficient for all maturities...|$|E
