5|$|The second kingdom {{appears to}} be a {{powerful}} and prosperous political center, kings held the title of Lugal, and many are attested in the city, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> source is the letter of king Enna-Dagan c. 2350 BC, which was sent to Irkab-Damu of Ebla, and in it, the Mariote king mentions his predecessors and their military achievements. However, the reading of this letter is still problematic and many interpretations have been presented by scholars.|$|E
5|$|Commercially viable natural {{deposits}} of graphite occur {{in many parts}} of the world, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> sources economically are in China, India, Brazil and North Korea. Graphite deposits are of metamorphic origin, found in association with quartz, mica and feldspars in schists, gneisses and metamorphosed sandstones and limestone as lenses or veins, sometimes of a metre or more in thickness. Deposits of graphite in Borrowdale, Cumberland, England were at first of sufficient size and purity that, until the 19th century, pencils were made simply by sawing blocks of natural graphite into strips before encasing the strips in wood. Today, smaller {{deposits of}} graphite are obtained by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite out on water.|$|E
5|$|Demosthenes {{tailored}} {{his style}} {{to be very}} audience-specific. He took pride in not relying on attractive words but rather simple, effective prose. He was mindful of his arrangement, he used clauses to create patterns that would make seemingly complex sentences easy for the hearer to follow. His tendency to focus on delivery promoted him to use repetition, this would ingrain the importance into the audience's minds; he also relied on speed and delay to create suspense and interest among the audience when presenting to most important aspects of his speech. One of his most effective skills was his ability to strike a balance: his works were complex so that the audience would not be offended by any elementary language, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> parts were clear and easily understood.|$|E

5|$|Many other binary {{nitrogen}} hydrides are known, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> are hydrazine (N2H4) {{and hydrogen}} azide (HN3). Although {{it is not}} a nitrogen hydride, hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is similar in properties and structure to ammonia and hydrazine as well. Hydrazine is a fuming, colourless liquid that smells similarly to ammonia. Its physical properties are very similar to those of water (melting point 2.0°C, boiling point 113.5°C, density 1.00g·cm−3). Despite it being an endothermic compound, it is kinetically stable. It burns quickly and completely in air very exothermically to give nitrogen and water vapour. It is a very useful and versatile reducing agent and is a weaker base than ammonia. It is also commonly used as a rocket fuel.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his success}} against the Gepids, Alboin {{had failed to}} greatly {{increase}} his power, and was now faced with a much stronger threat from the Avars. Historians consider this the decisive factor in convincing Alboin to undertake a migration, {{even though there are}} indications that before the war with the Gepids a decision was maturing to leave for Italy, a country thousands of Lombards had seen in the 550s when hired by the Byzantines to fight in the Gothic War. Additionally, the Lombards would have known of the weakness of Byzantine Italy, which had endured a number of problems after being retaken from the Goths. In particular the so-called Plague of Justinian had ravaged the region and conflict remained endemic, with the Three-Chapter Controversy sparking religious opposition and administration at a standstill after the able governor of the peninsula, Narses, was recalled. Nevertheless, the Lombards viewed Italy as a rich land which promised great booty, assets Alboin used to gather together a horde which included not only Lombards but many other peoples of the region, including Heruli, Suebi, Gepids, Thuringii, Bulgars, Sarmatians, the remaining Romans and a few Ostrogoths. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> group, other than the Lombards, were the Saxons, of whom 20,000 male warriors with their families participated in the trek. These Saxons were tributaries to the Frankish King Sigebert, and their participation indicates that Alboin had the support of the Franks for his venture.|$|E

25|$|The Dartmoor tin {{industry}} {{declined in}} importance {{during the early}} 18th century and had fallen to nothing by 1730.

25|$|Mansa Musa was {{succeeded by}} his son in 1337, which marked the {{beginning}} of the empire’s slide into decline. Mansa Maghan ruled four years before his death, which was probably hastened by Musa’s brother Suleyman. Sometime during these four years, Mossi horsemen from the Upper Volta raided Timbuktu and surrounding cities. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> development of the period was Songhai's assertion of independence for good from Mali in 1340.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} part of the Egyptian view of the cosmos was the conception of time, which was greatly concerned with the maintenance of Ma'at.

25|$|The first horrea {{were built}} in Rome {{towards the end of}} the 2nd century BC, with the first known public horreum being {{constructed}} by the ill-fated tribune, Gaius Gracchus in 123 BC.

While some was eaten fresh, most was stored away in pots and cellars for the winter and droughts. When some of the corn dried, it was turned into flour and bread by the women. They would sit outside at grinding stones, singing religious songs while rubbing stones against the corn, producing flour. They sang, because they considered the corn to be sacred.|$|E
