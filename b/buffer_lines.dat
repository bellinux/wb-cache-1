50|$|A second key {{concept is}} that {{movement}} along a buffer line must correspond {{to a change}} in PCO2. Thus, like the isopleths, the buffer line as drawn on a typical Davenport Diagram (e.g., Fig 6) is actually the projection of a line existing in three-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional plane. As with the isopleths, <b>buffer</b> <b>lines</b> in their actual three-dimensional orientation are confined to the surface representing the values of PCO2, HCO3− and pH that satisfy equilibrium for the system. In Fig. 10, the dark red lines are the actual <b>buffer</b> <b>lines</b> in three-dimensional space, while the light red lines are the projections of the <b>buffer</b> <b>lines</b> onto a two-dimensional plane. (We will see later how multiple, parallel <b>buffer</b> <b>lines</b> can be determined for a given system).|$|E

40|$|Whole blood oxygen {{equilibrium}} curves (02 ECs), blood <b>buffer</b> <b>lines,</b> {{and several}} hematologic properties were determined for adult guinea pigs exposed to 700 ppm methyl isocyanate (MIC) for 15 min. MIC inhalation effected {{a significant reduction}} of blood 02 affinity; the half-saturation pressure (P 50) at 38 °C increased from the control (untreated) level of 22. 8 ± 0. 1 mm Hg to values ranging from 28. 5 to 43. 7 mm Hg for experimental animals. MIC exposure had no apparent influence on 02 EC shape or CO 2 Bohr effect. Erythrocyte volume, [metHb], 02 binding capacity, and combined red cell organic phosphate concentration (DPG + ATP) were not affected by MIC treatment. However, experimental animals experienced a severe metabolic acid-base disturbance; blood lactate concentration ranged from 8. 6 to 24. 0 mmole/L. Results indicate that lactic acidosis was solely responsible for increased blood P., of MIC-treated animals. No direct effects of MIC on hemoglobin function were observed. Reduced Hb- 02 affinity, in conjunction with severe hypoxemia, compromised the guinea pigs ' capacity for pulmonary 02 loading; at Pao 2 of 30 mm Hg, Hb- 02 saturation (S) decreased from 66 % S for controls to 42 % S for MIC-treated animals...|$|E

50|$|Changes in the {{metabolic}} composition of blood can also affect blood pH. Again, recall from our initial experiment that if strong acid or strong base {{is added to}} the blood sample, pH and bicarbonate concentration will change accordingly, resulting in a titration curve. Hydroxide ions, for example, when added to the solution, will react with free hydrogen ions and increase the pH of the solution. Additionally, hydroxide ions will abstract protons from carbonic acid in solution, causing the bicarbonate concentration to increase. The new position on the diagram following addition of hydroxide ions no longer lies on our original <b>buffer</b> <b>line.</b> However, if the PCO2 is now varied without further addition of strong acid or strong base to the solution, a new <b>buffer</b> <b>line</b> can be determined that lies above and approximately parallel to the original <b>buffer</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
50|$|If {{this same}} {{experiment}} is repeated at various partial pressures of carbon dioxide, {{a series of}} points will be obtained. One can draw a line through these points, called the <b>buffer</b> <b>line</b> (Fig. 6).|$|R
50|$|Similarly, in a {{physiologic}} system such as {{a living}} body, removal of protons, for example, by vomiting the acidic contents of the stomach, will result {{in an increase in}} pH and an increase in bicarbonate concentration, bringing the system to a new, higher <b>buffer</b> <b>line.</b> Such a disturbance is called a metabolic alkalosis (Fig. 12). Alternatively, if protons are added to the bloodstream in the form of acidic metabolites, as occurs during diabetic ketoacidosis, then pH will fall, along with bicarbonate concentration. This type of disturbance is called a metabolic acidosis. In the case of metabolic acidosis, the new <b>buffer</b> <b>line</b> lies below the original line.|$|R
50|$|A key {{concept in}} {{understanding}} the Davenport Diagram is to note that as PCO2 is increased, {{the magnitude of the}} resulting change in pH is dependent on the buffering power of the non-bicarbonate buffers present in the solution. If strong non-bicarbonate buffers are present, then they will quickly absorb the vast majority of protons released by the formation of bicarbonate, and pH will change very little for a given rise in bicarbonate concentration. The result will be a <b>buffer</b> <b>line</b> with a very steep slope (Fig. 8). On the other hand, if only weak non-bicarbonate buffers are present (or if no non-bicarbonate buffer is present at all), then a much larger change in pH will be observed for a given change in bicarbonate concentration, and the <b>buffer</b> <b>line</b> will have a slope closer to zero.|$|R

Additionally, for each experimental point, a titration experiment can be performed in which pH is varied while PCO2 is held constant, and titration curves can be generated for each of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Fig. 7). In the Davenport Diagram, these titration curves are called isopleths, because they are generated at a fixed partial pressure of carbon dioxide.|$|R

40|$|In deep {{sub-micron}} technologies, as {{the wires}} are placed ever closer and signal {{rise and fall}} times go into the sub-nano second region, increased crosstalk has implications on the data throughput and on signal integrity.

5000|$|But {{the goal}} {{foremost}} {{pursued by the}} US was to push the Osage out of areas being settled by European Americans, who began to enter the Louisiana Territory after the US acquired it. The lucrative fur trade stimulated the growth of St. Louis and attracted settlers there. The US and Osage signed their first treaty on November 10, 1808, by which the Osage made a major cession of land in present-day Missouri. Under the Osage Treaty, they ceded 52480000 acre to the federal government. This treaty created a <b>buffer</b> <b>line</b> between the Osage and new European-American settlers in the Missouri Territory. It also established the requirement that the U.S. President had to approve all future land sales and cessions by the Osage.|$|R

The card reader had no memory buffers, but instead gave the CPU a level-zero (highest priority) interrupt after each individual column of the card had been read. If the CPU did not respond and store the twelve bits of data before another such interrupt indicated that the next column had been read, data would be lost. Similarly, the 1132 printer relied on software on the 1130. When a letter such as [...] came into position, the CPU had to analyze a <b>buffered</b> <b>line</b> of text and assemble an array of bits that would indicate to the 1132 which print positions should be printed with [...] If the CPU could not respond before the [...] rotated out of position, print speed would be severely degraded.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Energy {{efficiency}} plays {{a crucial}} role in the design of embedded processors especially for portable devices with its limited energy source in the form of batteries. Since memory access (either cache or main memory) consumes a significant portion of the energy of a processor, the design of fast low-energy caches has become a very important aspect of modern processor design. In this paper, we present a novel cache architecture for reduced energy instruction caches. Our proposed cache architecture consists of the L 1 cache, multiple <b>line</b> <b>buffers,</b> and a prediction mechanism to predict which <b>line</b> <b>buffer,</b> or L 1 cache to access next. We used simulation to evaluate our proposed architecture and compare it with the HotSpot cache, Filter cache, Predictive <b>line</b> <b>buffer</b> cache and Way-Halting cache.
