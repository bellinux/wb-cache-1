50|$|In a {{sea change}} for the magazine, Ermelino oversaw the {{integration}} of self-published <b>book</b> <b>reviews</b> into the main review section of the magazine. Review editors vet and assign self-published <b>books</b> for <b>review,</b> which reviews are then published alongside the reviews of traditionally published books each week in the magazine. Publishers Weekly does not charge for self-published <b>book</b> <b>reviews,</b> bucking a trend within the industry led by Kirkus Reviews and Foreword’s Clarion fee-for-review service, both of which offer independent <b>book</b> <b>reviews</b> in exchange for fees {{in the hundreds of}} dollars.|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} part of this text, I would like to {{describe}} some advantages <b>book</b> <b>reviews</b> offer. The <b>book</b> reviews—providing the fact that they succeed in offering more than just a short content description to the reader—can also contribute to scientific discourses in a similar way regular contributions do. One of the reasons why <b>book</b> <b>reviews</b> currently often do not fulfil this possible function is due to the existing restrictions within traditional print media publishing. Additionally worth mentioning are actual standards within the scientific community which tend to underestimate the value of <b>book</b> <b>reviews</b> or review essays. In the second part, I will discuss some developmental potentials in <b>book</b> <b>reviews</b> which up to now were hardly recognized: Especially with the Internet and its characteristics-nearly unlimited space resources; flexible publishing time and design of the contributions; chance for a direct exchange between researchers, for example using discussion boards—a re-evaluation of <b>book</b> <b>reviews</b> and review essays seems to be possible and reasonable.

5|$|Entertainment Weekly, the Los Angeles Times, and The New York Times <b>Book</b> <b>Review</b> {{considered}} Middlesex one of {{the best}} books of 2002, and some scholars believed the novel should be considered for the title of Great American Novel. Generally, reviewers felt that the novel succeeded in portraying its Greek immigrant drama and were also impressed with Eugenides' depiction of his hometown of Detroit—praising him for his social commentary. Reviewers from the medical, gay, and intersex communities mostly praised Middlesex, though some intersex commentators have been more critical. In 2007, the book was featured in Oprah's Book Club.|$|E
5|$|Ideas for a {{film about}} the Schindlerjuden (Schindler Jews) were {{proposed}} as early as 1963. Poldek Pfefferberg, one of the Schindlerjuden, made it his life's mission {{to tell the story}} of Schindler. Spielberg became interested in the story when executive Sidney Sheinberg sent him a <b>book</b> <b>review</b> of Schindler's Ark. Universal Pictures bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several other directors before finally deciding to direct the film himself.|$|E
5|$|Israeli {{historian}} Omer Bartov, {{writing for}} The New York Times <b>Book</b> <b>Review,</b> judged The Holocaust Industry to be marred {{by the same}} errors he denounces in those who exploit the Holocaust for profit or politics:It is filled with {{precisely the kind of}} shrill hyperbole that Finkelstein rightly deplores in much of the current media hype over the Holocaust; it is brimming with the same indifference to historical facts, inner contradictions, strident politics and dubious contextualizations; and it oozes with the same smug sense of moral and intellectual superiority... Like any conspiracy theory, it contains several grains of truth; and like any such theory, it is both irrational and insidious.|$|E

5|$|Goosebumps {{was listed}} 15th {{in the list}} of most {{frequently}} challenged books during 1990–1999 and 94th {{in the list of}} top banned/challenged books during 2000–2009 by the American Library Association (ALA). According to the ALA, a challenge is an attempt by a person or group to remove or restrict materials from a library or school curriculum. The series was challenged for being too frightening for young people and depicting occult or demonic themes. By 1997, the ALA was informed of 46 challenges, over 75% of which occurred in school libraries. The rest of the challenges were held in public libraries or the location of the challenges were unknown. The same year, a hearing by the Anoka-Hennepin School District to ban the books was broadcast by C-SPAN. In the hearing, most of the parents and children felt the books should not be banned, and the school district's <b>book</b> <b>review</b> committee decided to keep the books.|$|E
