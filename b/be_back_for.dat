500|$|The Baltimore Suns David Zurawik was {{critical}} of the show's characterization and comedy, but {{was impressed by the}} staging of [...] "Don't Stop Believin', calling it [...] "so elevating and inspirational that it almost redeems all the stereotypes and lame humor that come before. Grit my teeth as I did at how one-dimensionally empty-headed the writing could be, I will still <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>for</b> the start of this series in the fall because of its musical punch." [...] Tom Jicha for The Sun Sentinel similarly claimed of the episode that: [...] "A lively score and appealing performers somewhat compensate for overly familiar characters and plotting", while Rob Owen for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette agreed: [...] "It's the music that makes Glee a gleeful delight. Without the song-and-dance production numbers, this Fox pilot would be just another high-school-set comedy-drama." ...|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the season, {{speculation}} intensified {{about which}} players might enter professional football though the 2008 NFL Draft.

All of our underclassmen have told us they will be coming back, but if you're playing well enough to be considered an NFL prospect, going through the process can only help you better understand it and realize what you need to work on to improve your status." [...] Charles said he would not go pro unless he was predicted to be chosen in the first round of the draft. [...] After the Holiday Bowl Charles said, [...] "Right now, I’m probably coming back. I didn’t think I did that good in the game. Next year maybe I’ll be up for the Heisman. I will come back." [...] From 2000–2007, the Longhorns have had sevenplayers taken in the first 10 picks of the NFL draft, more than any other school.|$|E

2500|$|Needing a win to {{maintain}} their playoff hopes, the Buccaneers broke a two-game losing streak while setting several team records, including most points scored and largest margin of victory. The Packers appeared to be driving for a touchdown after Tampa Bay took an early 3–0 lead, but an injury to quarterback David Whitehurst forced the Packers to replace him with the inexperienced Rich Campbell. Shortly thereafter, Cedric Brown caught the first of Campbell's four interceptions while scoring a touchdown on an interception return for the second week in a row. The special teams performed well, with [...] John Holt returning a punt 56 yards and Bill Capece kicking three field goals, including a Buccaneer-record 51-yarder. For the first time ever, Tampa Bay went the entire game without having to punt. Despite a league-worst rushing average, the Buccaneers ran for 212 yards, led by James Owens with 112. Owens' 35-yard touchdown run was the longest Buccaneer touchdown run in Tampa Stadium. The win was attributed to several changes in coaching approach. As the offensive line was performing poorly due to injuries that kept them from maintaining a consistent lineup, McKay simplified the offense by calling the same plays repeatedly. McKay also allowed the team to practice without pads during the week, while instituting defensive changes designed {{to cut down on}} opponents' ability to control the ball through consistent short-yardage gains. He also took more of a hands-on approach to game day, giving a pep talk to the team prior to the game, and taking over the calling of the running plays. Defensive end Bill Kollar suffered a cartilage tear that required season-ending knee surgery, although the possibility remained that he could <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>for</b> the playoffs.|$|E
2500|$|The opera {{begins with}} a short {{introduction}} which segues into an evening in Catfish Row. Jasbo Brown entertains the community with his piano playing. Clara, a young mother, sings a lullaby to her baby ("Summertime") as the working men prepare for a game of craps ("Roll them Bones"). One of the players, Robbins, scorns his wife Serena's demands that he not play, retorting that on a Saturday night, a man {{has the right to}} play. Clara's husband, the fisherman Jake, tries his own lullaby ("A Woman is a Sometime Thing") with little effect. Little by little, other characters in the opera enter Catfish Row, among them Mingo, another fisherman, and Jim, a stevedore who, tired of his job, decides to give it up and join Jake and the other fishermen. Porgy, a disabled beggar, enters on his goat cart to organize the game. Peter, an elderly [...] "honey man" [...] returns, singing his vendor's call. Crown, a strong and brutal stevedore, storms in with his woman, Bess, and buys cheap whiskey and some [...] "Happy Dust" [...] off the local dope peddler, Sportin' Life. Bess is shunned by the women of the community, especially the pious Serena and the matriarchal cookshop owner Maria, but Porgy softly defends her. The game begins. One by one, the players get crapped out, leaving only Robbins and Crown, who has become extremely drunk. When Robbins wins, Crown attempts to prevent him from taking his winnings. A brawl ensues, which ends when Crown stabs Robbins with a cotton hook, killing him. Crown runs, telling Bess to fend for herself but that he will <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>for</b> her when the heat dies down. Sportin' Life gives her a dose of happy dust and offers to take her with him when he goes to New York, but she rejects him. He flees, and Bess begins to pound on doors, but is rejected by all of the residents of Catfish Row, with the exception of Porgy, who lets her in.|$|E

2500|$|On 27 February 2016, it was {{confirmed}} that Westbrook would reprise the role {{for a few}} episodes. Her return will coincide with Kemp's return as Sam's brother Grant and Windsor's final appearance as Sam's mother Peggy. Of her return Westbrook said, 'I'm really excited to be going back to EastEnders". Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said: [...] "It is only right that all of Peggy Mitchell's children would be at her funeral. Danniella is the final piece of the Mitchell jigsaw puzzle, so it will be great for viewers to see Phil, Grant and Sam all back on screen. Sam will only <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>for</b> a few episodes, but these scenes are bound to go down in the soap's history." [...] While appearing on an episode of Loose Women on 24 March 2016, Westbrook expressed interest in reprising the role of Sam on a full-time basis. Westbrook returned to filming on 3 May 2016. Letitia Dean who plays Sharon Watts revealed that there would be [...] "fireworks" [...] when Sam returns. Dean revealed: [...] "Sam coming back is a shock. It's obviously {{been a long time since}} anyone has seen her and she is trouble through and through. But Peggy is her mum, so of course she had to be there for the funeral". She went on to say: [...] "They do have a bit of a run-in with each other and Sharon is caught out which really panics her, especially that Sam has come back and seems to be unhappy that Sharon is so involved with the Mitchells." [...] Westbrook later expressed her disappointment with Sam only appearing in four episodes in an Instagram post. [...] "It's such a shame I won't be going back to the show as I think people would of [...] loved to see Sam as a mum and with a different take on the character… But I don't write the show I just do what they tell me," [...] Westbrook went on to say: [...] "And they've done what they always do use Sam when she's needed & then send her off in a black cab. I wish @bbceastenders would listen to the public more. But either way I'm grateful of the 4 episodes I got to film." [...] Her return scenes aired on 30 June with her final scenes aired on 8 July 2016. In March 2017, Westbrook expressed interest in reprising her role as Sam but feared the show would just use her for publicity. On 11 May 2017, Westbrook claimed during an interview on Loose Women that she would be reprising her role as Sam later in the year, however an EastEnders source denied this, saying, [...] "There are no plans for Danniella to return, it's just not going to happen. It's very odd that she keeps harping on about her return to the soap cause it has plainly never been discussed." ...|$|E
