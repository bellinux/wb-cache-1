To these was added a further force in Flanders to attack {{what was to be}} France’s major goal for 1692, the {{important}} Sambre–Meuse fortress of Namur.

25|$|Provide an {{algorithm}} that secures a win for one player, or a {{draw for}} either, against any possible moves by the opponent, {{from the beginning}} of the game. That is, produce at least one complete ideal game (all moves start to end) with proof that each move is optimal for the player making it. It does not necessarily mean a computer program using the solution will play optimally against an imperfect opponent. For example, the checkers program Chinook will never turn a drawn position into a losing position (since the weak solution of checkers proves that it is a draw), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> possibly turn a winning position into a drawn position because Chinook does not expect the opponent to play a move that will not win but could possibly lose, and so it does not analyze such moves completely.|$|E
25|$|As {{the country}} {{recovered}} from financial depression following the Panic of 1819, {{the question of}} internal improvements again forged to the front. In 1822, a bill to authorize the collection of tolls on the Cumberland Road had been vetoed by the President. In an elaborate essay, Monroe set forth his views on the constitutional aspects of a policy of internal improvements. Congress might appropriate money, he admitted, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> not undertake the actual construction of national works nor assume jurisdiction over them. For the moment, the drift toward a larger participation {{of the national government}} in internal improvements was stayed. Two years later, Congress authorized the President to institute surveys for such roads and canals as he believed to be needed for commerce and military defense. No one pleaded more eloquently for a larger conception of the functions of the national government than Henry Clay. He called the attention of his hearers to provisions made for coast surveys and lighthouses on the Atlantic seaboard and deplored the neglect of the interior of the country. Of the other presidential candidates, Jackson voted in the Senate for the general survey bill; and Adams left no doubt in the public mind that he did not reflect the narrow views of his section on this issue. Crawford felt the constitutional scruples which were everywhere being voiced in the South, and followed the old expedient of advocating a constitutional amendment to sanction national internal improvements.|$|E

[...] Cynethryth's name is known from two of Wiglaf's charters, dated 831 and 836, and historian Pauline Stafford notes that her name [...] "seems to hark back to the kin of Coenwulf if not earlier royal lines", but as with Wiglaf himself, nothing certain is known of her ancestry.

The painting {{was one of a}} number of artworks that Mellon had purchased from the Hermitage during the 1930s. He denied having made these purchases for several years, since the US was in a major depression — which would have made the acquisitions seem extravagant — and at odds with the Soviet government.

However, after finishing the song, he took preference to another song, [...] "Forever", which later became the lead single from his re-released album, titled Exclusive: The Forever Edition (2008). He felt that [...] "Disturbia" [...] would be better suited for a female singer and instead forwarded the song to Rihanna. When writing the song, he was inspired [...] "to go totally left and kind of weird". Speaking to USA Today, Brown described his feelings with regard to him giving the song to Rihanna: [...] "It's fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about, you can write it and give it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be an idea you have." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite their {{sometimes}} differing viewpoints, {{these experts}} generally agree that Bismarck would have eventually foundered if the Germans had not scuttled her first. Ballard estimated that Bismarck could still have floated {{for at least}} a day when the British vessels ceased fire and could have been captured by the Royal Navy, a position supported by the historian Ludovic Kennedy (who was serving [...] on the destroyer [...] at the time). Kennedy stated, [...] "That she would have foundered eventually there can be little doubt; but the scuttling ensured that it was sooner rather than later." [...] When asked whether Bismarck would have sunk if the Germans had not scuttled the ship, Cameron replied [...] "Sure. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have taken half a day." [...] In Mearns' subsequent book Hood and Bismarck, he conceded that scuttling [...] "may have hastened the inevitable, but only by a matter of minutes."

500|$|At the University of Birmingham in March 1940, Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls {{examined}} the theoretical {{issues involved in}} developing, producing and using atomic bombs in a paper that {{became known as the}} Frisch–Peierls memorandum. They considered what would happen to a sphere of pure uranium-235, and found that not only could a chain reaction occur, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> require as little as [...] of uranium-235 to unleash the energy of hundreds of tons of TNT. The first person they showed their paper to was Oliphant, and he immediately took it to Sir Henry Tizard, the chairman of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Warfare (CSSAW). As a result, a special subcommittee of the CSSAW known as the MAUD Committee was created to investigate the matter further. It was chaired by Sir George Thomson, and its original membership included Oliphant, Chadwick, Cockcroft and Moon. In its final report in July 1941, the MAUD Committee concluded that an atomic bomb was not only feasible, but might be produced as early as 1943.|$|E

500|$|Tubman {{was born}} Araminta [...] "Minty" [...] Ross to slave parents, Harriet ("Rit") Green and Ben Ross. Rit {{was owned by}} Mary Pattison Brodess (and later her son Edward). Ben was held by Anthony Thompson, who became Mary's second husband, and who ran a large {{plantation}} near Blackwater River in Madison, Maryland. As with many slaves in the United States, neither the exact year nor place of Araminta's birth is known, and historians differ as to the best estimate. Kate Larson records the year as 1822, based on a midwife payment and several other historical documents, including her runaway advertisement, while Jean Humez says [...] "the best current evidence suggests that Tubman was born in 1820, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have been {{a year or two}} later." [...] Catherine Clinton notes that Tubman reported the year of her birth as 1825, while her death certificate lists 1815 and her gravestone lists 1820. In her Civil War widow's pension records, Tubman claimed she was born in 1820, 1822, and 1825, an indication, perhaps, that she had only a general idea of when she was born.|$|E
500|$|Progress {{was slow}} in the United States, but in Britain, Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls, two refugee {{physicists}} from Germany at the University of Birmingham, examined the theoretical {{issues involved in}} developing, producing and using atomic bombs.

Their superior, Mark Oliphant, took the Frisch–Peierls memorandum to Sir Henry Tizard, the chairman of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Warfare (CSSAW), who in turn passed it on to George Paget Thomson, to whom the CSSAW had delegated responsibility for uranium research. CSSAW created the MAUD Committee to investigate. In its final report in July 1941, the MAUD Committee concluded that an atomic bomb was not only feasible, but might be produced as early as 1943. In response, the British government created a nuclear weapons project known as Tube Alloys.|$|E
500|$|The ban expired {{the week}} ending 30 May 2008, with the {{conviction}} of Goussis {{for the murder of}} Lewis Moran, paving the way for Nine to begin screening episodes; however, Andrew Rule, who co-wrote the book on which the series is based, says Underbelly will not be seen in Victoria anytime soon, saying [...] "the problem now will be that Tony Mokbel is back in Australia and ready to stand trial on very serious charges. That will effectively prevent the series being screened in Victoria until that trial is held... That could be some time. I'm not sure about several , <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be two years." [...] However, Underbelly was legally shown in Victoria in September 2008, after a court ruled that the network could air the first five episodes. Supreme Court Justice Peter Vickery gave the network permission to air the specially edited episodes, but said screening the sixth episode could prejudice the upcoming trials of an accused criminal.

Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly gave Strip Me a C rating and wrote that it [...] "plays like one long, increasingly desperate pep talk. The only breather? 'Unexpected Hero,' a lovely late-Beatles-style ballad." [...] AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted the album for [...] "retaining [...] same blend of well-manicured R and European sophistication" [...] of Bedingfield's debut album and commented that she [...] "plays it exceptionally safe, {{to the extent}} that she even tones down the self-empowerment of her first two records, preferring pristine blue-eyed soul and adult contemporary ballads, all tailored for an aspirational upscale lifestyle". Slant magazine's Jonathon Keefe found it [...] "single-minded in its uplifting, inspirational tone", writing in conclusion that [...] "Bedingfield uses her powerful voice to oversing most of her material, making Strip Me feel like even more of a sermon.

In the film, Selena's real voice {{is used for the}} musical sequences in Selena, but Lopez would nonetheless sing the lyrics during the scenes instead of lip syncing. When asked in an interview if Selena inspired her to launch a music career, Lopez stated: [...] "I really, really became inspired, because I started my career in musical theater on stage. So doing the movie just reminded me of how much I missed singing, dancing, and the like..." [...] After filming Selena, Lopez was [...] "really feeling [...] Latin roots" [...] and cut a demo in Spanish. Lopez's manager then sent the song, entitled [...] "Vivir Sin Ti", to Sony Music Entertainment's Work Group, who showed an interest in signing Lopez. Tommy Mottola, the head of the label suggested to her that she sing in English instead. She complied and began recording her debut studio album On the 6. During production of the album, Lopez was {{aware of the fact that}} she received her recording contract on the premise of her looks and having an already established name in the entertainment industry, and wanted to prove that she had musical talent.
