The two countries also agreed to share technology and set international standards for biofuels. The Brazilian sugar cane technology transfer would allow several Central American, Caribbean and Andean countries to take advantage of their tariff-free trade agreements to increase or become exporters to the United States in the short-term. Also, in August 2007, Brazil's President toured Mexico and several countries in Central America and the Caribbean to promote Brazilian ethanol technology. The ethanol alliance between the U.S. and Brazil generated some negative reactions from Venezuela's President Hugo Chávez, and by then Cuba's President, Fidel Castro, who wrote: [...] "you will see how many people among the hungry masses of our planet will no longer consume corn... Or even worse, by offering financing to poor countries to produce ethanol from corn or any other kind of food, no tree will be left to defend humanity from climate change." [...] Daniel Ortega, Nicaragua's President, and one of the preferential recipients of Brazilian technical aid also voiced critics to the <b>Bush</b> <b>plan,</b> but he vowed support for sugar cane based ethanol during Lula's visit to Nicaragua.|$|E
50|$|Economic growth, though positive, has {{not been}} {{sufficient}} to generate jobs and prevent unemployment from rising. In fact,there {{are now more than}} two million fewer private sector jobs than {{at the start of the}} current recession. Overcapacity,corporate scandals, and uncertainty have and will continue to weigh down the economy.The tax cut plan proposed by President Bush is not the answer to these problems. Regardless of how one views the specificsof the <b>Bush</b> <b>plan,</b> there is wide agreement that its purpose is a permanent change in the tax structure and not the creationof jobs and growth in the near-term. The permanent dividend tax cut, in particular, is not credible as a short-term stimulus.As tax reform, the dividend tax cut is misdirected in that it targets individuals rather than corporations, is overlycomplex, and could be, but is not, part of a revenue-neutral tax reform effort.Passing these tax cuts will worsen the long-term budget outlook, adding to the nation’s projected chronic deficits. Thisfiscal deterioration will reduce the capacity of the government to finance Social Security and Medicare benefits as well asinvestments in schools, health, infrastructure, and basic research. Moreover, the proposed tax cuts will generate furtherinequalities in after-tax income.To be effective, a stimulus plan should rely on immediate but temporary spending and tax measures to expand demand,and it should also rely on immediate but temporary incentives for investment. Such a stimulus plan would spur growthand jobs in the short term without exacerbating the long-term budget outlook.|$|E
5000|$|Newly elected President George H. W. Bush had {{announced}} a “goodwill begets goodwill” gesture {{in his inaugural}} speech on January 29, 1989. The Bush administration urged Rafsanjani to use Iran’s “considerable political capital in Lebanon” to obtain {{the release of the}} remaining US hostages held by Hezbollah. Bush indicated there would be a reciprocal gesture toward Iran by the United States.1Iran’s new leadership had also lowered its rhetoric against the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf and had not as yet endorsed Sunni fundamentalist groups like Hamas. Rafsanjani indicated Iran would support whatever agreement the Palestinians settled on with Israel. Bush’s national Security advisor Brent Scowcroft had said, in late 1991, {{it might be possible to}} take Iran off the terrorist list, reduce economic sanctions, and further compensate Iranians for the shooting down of an Iranian civilian Airbus jet with a missile launched by a United States ship in July 1988, by mistake. (All 290 Iranian passengers and crew had been killed.) Scowcroft indicated the administration was even considering allowing the sale of some airplanes and parts and easing other economic sanctions on Iran.2Bush did not respond to Iran’s gesture, even after the last hostage, reporter Terry Anderson, was finally released in December 1991. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates had been known as the CIA’s “hardliner” on the Soviet Union and Iran and had previously urged Bush not to respond to Iran’s goodwill gestures. Gates argued, “We have to look at the history of outreach (to Iran) that was very real, under successive presidents, yet did not yield any results.” Gates’ vetoing of the <b>Bush</b> <b>plan</b> to reciprocate Iran’s goodwill gesture was, as he explained later to Congress, developed because “new intelligence showed Iran was seeking weapons of mass destruction and planning terrorist attacks.” Gates often repeated in CIA staff meetings that the “only moderate Iranian is one who has run out of bullets.”3Rafsanjani never forgave the Americans for Bush’s reneging on his promise of goodwill after the hostages were released or for Iran’s exclusion from the Madrid (and Oslo) Conferences.41[...] George H.

40|$|This policy note {{examines}} {{the case for}} large tax cuts, focusing on the issues surrounding the purpose and overall size of the needed cut. Although Congress has passed a significant package of tax relief, many have worried that the budget surplus on which it was based will never appear. Thus, some have advocated "triggers " {{to reduce the size}} of the tax cuts should tax revenues begin to decline. This note argues that such a proposal represents "backward thinking. " IT'S OVER. The abundantly proportioned lady is singing. Federal Reserve chairman Greenspan has lost his luster and, as reported in the April 2 New York Times, fallen from "maestro " to "dot-com sucker " in the blink of an eye. Those bubble-com stocks are now cheaper than the air that filled the irrationally exuberant mania of the last millennium. Every day brings another round of profit disappointments, bankruptcy, and mass layoffs. State budgets are already feeling the effects of the downturn, as legislators are forced to cut spending in the face of projected exploding budget deficits. There will be no "V " recovery, nor even a "U " recovery; we've barely started down the vertical portion of the "L. " In an open letter to Congress, many prominent economists (including Nobel laureates Arrow, Klein, and Sharpe) warned that this downturn may be more severe than in the recent past. While they called hopefully for interest rate reductions, in a classic understatement (to which the Japanese can attest) they recognized that rate reductions alone may not suffice. Accordingly, they advocated a one-time tax cut, or "dividend, " that would provide each American taxpayer with a check, thus helping to boost the sagging economy. This measure contrasted with President Bush's plan, which they criticized as "too large, too skewed to the wealthy, " "too late to head off a recession, " and more fundamentally, "predicated on a 10 -year forecast of the U. S. economy, which no one can make with certainty. " As such, they said, the <b>Bush</b> <b>plan</b> risks a return to chronic budget deficits and a weakened capacity for the government to meet future spending requirements.

40|$|Bush 2 ̆ 7 s critics {{need to come}} up with a {{coherent}} alternative, argues DAVID BURCHELL PRESIDENT BUSH’s new strategy for Iraq has been subjected to a tidal-wave of critical reaction. Democrats in Congress have been manoeuvring to pass resolutions opposing the plan, without wanting to bear the opprobrium of refusing further funding for the US troops. Now Bush has exposed himself to further attack by seeking extra funds for the new Iraqi plan, even at the expense of domestic spending. Iraqis may perhaps thank him for this - but Americans mostly won’t. Bush’s original state of the nation speech noted that “honourable people have different views and they will voice their criticisms. ” Yet they too “have a responsibility to explain how the path they propose would be more likely to succeed. ” He had a point. No one with their head screwed on could seriously deny that Bush’s Iraq policy has been a political and humanitarian disaster. In this respect principled critics of the war have a perfect right to say “I told you so. ” But the politics of “I told you so” don’t advance the political debate far. Like it or not, once they’d overthrown Saddam, the US and their allies had acquired a political and moral duty to get the country onto a stable path. The fact that you may personally have disagreed with the policy doesn’t really enable you to wash your hands of this reality. “US out” has become a kind of talisman, which is supposed to obviate the need for other thought. Yet the most likely effect of a precipitate US withdrawal will be the final descent of Iraqi society into chaos - and perhaps into genocide of Rwandan proportions. If anything, it’s been the unreal idealism of the Americans which has tied their hands in the face of the unfolding disaster. Their grand plans for Iraqi democracy resulted in a sectarian-majority government, and required their troops to stand by while the capital descended into chaos. George Bush’s new plan effectively represents a shift in these priorities from democracy-building to civil peace. Those leading the charge against the new strategy aren’t doing so in the name of high moral principle. Rather, they argue simply that the conflict has become too expensive for America, both in terms of loss of life and money. In effect Congressional war critics seem to be remoulding themselves into the new isolationists. In so doing they are turning the political commonsense of the last century - where the democratic Left stood for human rights, and the Right for international “realism” and expediency - on its head. President Bush’s new strategy may well fail. The new US troops assigned to Baghdad are probably too small in number to bring the capital back from the brink. But the plan at least has a whisker of a chance. There is some evidence that some of the militias may be wearying of the carnage. And their enthusiasm for taking on well-trained American troops, rather than hapless bystanders, may be waning. Until somebody comes up with a serious alternative, the <b>Bush</b> <b>plan</b> is probably the least worst chance ordinary Iraqis still have. • David Burchell teaches in Humanities at the University of Western Sydney, and is associate editor of APO.

40|$|Frank Lowy’s move {{to fund a}} {{new policy}} {{institute}} is bold and creative, says Michael Liffman IT MAY BE no coincidence that within days of being listed as one of Australia’s richest men, Frank Lowy announced last week a personal gift of 30 million {{for the establishment of}} a new policy institute focusing on Australia 2 ̆ 7 s place in the world. In so doing Lowy is embodying a local variant of a peculiarly American story. His ascent from refugee holocaust survivor to billionaire property developer and retailer will be admired by many and viewed askance by some, but his willingness to be a bold philanthropist has much to offer this country. For the past century and more, the US has demonstrated a culture and practice of philanthropy on a scale, and a level of maturity, as yet unknown in this country. The consequences, in terms of the enrichment of public facilities for research and education, culture, and policy debate, are embedded in the very fabric of American society. They range from prestigious organisations such as the Ford Foundation to the countless endowments through which college alumni make education more affordable. The foundation Bill Gates established, focused on children 2 ̆ 7 s health in underdeveloped countries, is one of the world’s biggest, and recently CNN founder Ted Turner reaffirmed his intention to contribute US 1 billion (A 1. 5 billion) to the United Nations Foundation during the next 10 years. Some manifestations of America’s traditional commitment to giving would probably strike some as a little bizarre. Ruth Lilly, the 87 -year-old heiress to the Eli Lilly pharmaceutical fortune, recently made a US 100 million (A 150 million) donation to the Modern Poetry Association. But more typical and common, and, by US standards, so unremarkable that it rated only a brief mention in the US-based fortnightly newspaper, The Chronicle of Philanthropy, is the US 220 million (A 340 million) given by Thomas S. Monaghan, the founder of Domino’s Pizza, to create a Catholic university in Florida. American philanthropy is a major force in the nation and, as such, is not without the inevitable complexities of a vigorous and mature industry. Disenchanted donor Paul Glenn is litigating to secure the return of his US 1. 6 million (A 2. 5 million) gift to the University of Southern California, claiming it was not applied to his intended purpose, researching the biology of ageing. A major contributor to another university is demanding its trustees resign on grounds of incompetence, and is ceasing all his support to other causes until they do. The American Association of Museums has issued a code of ethics governing dealings with donors in the face of controversies such as those, which arose when New York’s Guggenheim Museum staged an exhibition of Georgio Armani clothes while receiving a US 15 million (A 23 million) gift from the fashion designer. Some charities are objecting to the activities of a number of charity watch-dogs that have emerged during recent years, which offer potential donors, sometimes for a fee, a detailed financial and performance assessment of the countless charities competing for their dollar. In Congress a debate is looming on the <b>Bush</b> <b>plan</b> to make it easier for religious charities to compete for federal grants, with some critics fearing an inappropriate mix of church and state, and concerned at the possible exclusion of Muslim communities from the first round of funding. Nor does everyone agree with the dominant position held by private giving in the US. Implicit in this role are assumptions many Australians would question as to the responsibilities of government, and the place of private generosity, in shaping the welfare, cultural and public policy arrangements of the state. Nevertheless fund-raisers, and those managing our seemingly evermore unaffordable educational, research and cultural institutions, can only stand in awe of the products of a philanthropic practice so deeply and unapologetically embedded in American society. Yet even here the Americans surprise us. A prominent American recently launched a campaign opposing President George W. Bush’s push to repeal estate (ie, death) duties. The wealthy, he insists, have an obligation to pay a higher share of taxes, as ‘there 2 ̆ 7 s no such thing as a self-made millionaire’. The same forces that are driving philanthropy in the US are increasingly to be seen in Australia: new patterns of wealth and the ascendancy of the privileged ‘baby-boomer’ generation, an awareness that progress in living standards during recent decades has not assuaged the challenges communities the world over face, a retreat by government from social expenditures, and growing pressure on business to demonstrate real corporate citizenship. Australia does have a pantheon of distinguished philanthropists, past and present, sung and unsung, such as Alfred Felton, Sidney Myer and the Myer family, Richard Pratt, and many others. In entering this territory Lowy’s gift, large as it is, is not the largest. More interesting than its size is the fact that it is such a dramatic departure from usual Australian practice in which large donors direct their generosity towards a cause or an existing organisation which is uncontroversial, and whose outcomes will be reasonably evident and assured, and, usually, can be seen in ‘bricks and mortar’. The Lowy donation is closer to the American spirit where philanthropy drives pluralism and social experiment. Australia has few institutions of the sort Lowy is establishing and probably none resourced on as substantial a basis as should be possible for his. Assuming the pursuits of the institute Lowy proposes are open-minded, and its operations transparent, perhaps an equivalent to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace may result from his vision. Australia will be the better for such far-sighted philanthropy. Dr Liffman is director of the Asia-Pacific Centre for Philanthropy and Social Investment at Swinburne University.
