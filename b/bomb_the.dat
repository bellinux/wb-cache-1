5|$|By noon, {{the rebels}} of the 108th Infantry Regiment were {{approaching}} Bjelovar, and {{were joined by}} elements of the 42nd Infantry Regiment and other units of the division. The leader of the rebels in Bjelovar was Kapetan Ivan Mrak, a reserve aviator. When 4th Army commander Armijski đeneral Petar Nedeljković {{became aware of the}} rebels' approach, he ordered the local gendarmerie commander to maintain order, but was advised this would not be possible, as local gendarmerie conscripts would not report for duty. His headquarters reported the presence of the rebels to the headquarters of the 1st Army Group, suggesting that the Royal Yugoslav Air Force could <b>bomb</b> <b>the</b> rebel units. The 8th Bomber Regiment at Rovine was even warned to receive orders to use its Bristol Blenheim Mk I light bombers to <b>bomb</b> <b>the</b> 108th Infantry Regiment, but the idea was subsequently abandoned. Instead, it was decided to request that the leader of the Croatian Peasant Party, Vladko Maček intervene with the rebels.|$|E
5|$|Cochran and Nixon are {{assigned}} to accompany the crew transporting the bomb to Tinian. While assembling the <b>bomb,</b> <b>the</b> scientist comes into contact with radioactive material and dies. The following day, on August 6, 1945, the Enola Gay, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber, drops an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. After the mission, Nixon returns home {{to break the news}} of her husband's death to Cochran's wife.|$|E

5|$|In 1968, {{the second}} Congress of FRELIMO was a {{propaganda}} {{victory for the}} insurgents, despite attempts by the Portuguese, who enjoyed air superiority throughout the conflict, to <b>bomb</b> <b>the</b> location of the meeting late in the day. This gave FRELIMO further weight to wield in the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 7 April, three Blenheims of the Yugoslav 8th Bomber Regiment took off from Rovine to <b>bomb</b> <b>the</b> railway {{junction}} at Feldbach, but became disoriented in bad weather. Only one aircraft found a target in Austria, bombing a bridge and road near Steyr before continuing on to Wiener Neustadt where it was hit by anti-aircraft fire and made an emergency landing.|$|E
5|$|Security {{concerns}} {{related to}} crime and terrorism were not {{high on the}} agenda of the system's planners at its inception. After the Madrid train bombings in 2004 and the foiled plot to <b>bomb</b> <b>the</b> Yishun MRT Station in 2001, the operators deployed private, unarmed guards to patrol station platforms and conduct checks on the belongings of commuters, especially those carrying bulky items.|$|E

5|$|As {{outlined}} in the 3,500-word Nichols letter, the hearing focused on 24 allegations, 23 of which dealt with Oppenheimer's Communist and left-wing affiliations between 1938 and 1946, including his delayed and false reporting of the Chevalier incident to authorities. The twenty-fourth charge related to {{his opposition to the}} hydrogen bomb. By including the hydrogen <b>bomb,</b> <b>the</b> AEC changed the character of the hearing, by opening up an inquiry into his activities as a postwar government adviser.|$|E
50|$|On 12 November 1991, RaRa <b>bombed</b> <b>the</b> private {{house of}} Aad Kosto, {{member of the}} Dutch government.

50|$|The {{force of}} <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> {{overturned}} <b>the</b> police bus, damaged other nearby vehicles and heavily damaged {{the entrance of}} the hotel.

Damage and shattered windows were reported over a wide area, including at the 16th-century Şehzade Mosque.|$|R
5|$|Following the Soviet Union's {{successful}} {{nuclear test}} in August 1949, the U.S. was considering {{a crash course}} to develop a hydrogen <b>bomb.</b> <b>The</b> AEC's nine-member General Advisory Committee, chaired by J. Robert Oppenheimer, recommended unanimously against such a course, and Smyth {{was one of three}} of the five AEC commissioners to agree. Smyth urged Truman to endorse international control of nuclear weapons, but Truman decided instead to authorize a hydrogen bomb program. In his autobiography, Smyth's Princeton colleague John Archibald Wheeler recalled that Smyth recruited him to the Ivy Mike hydrogen bomb project and expressed support for the project in response to the Soviet test.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Ole Lippman, {{leader of}} the Danish section of the Special Operations Executive, invited the British Royal Air Force to assist their {{operations}} by attacking Nazi headquarters in Copenhagen. Accordingly, Air Vice-Marshal Sir Basil Embry drew up plans for a spectacular precision attack on the Sicherheitsdienst and Gestapo building, the former offices of the Shell Oil Company. Political prisoners were kept in the attic to prevent an air raid, so the RAF had to <b>bomb</b> <b>the</b> lower levels of the building.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the war, the camp was staffed by 7,000 members of the German Schutzstaffel (SS), {{approximately}} 12 percent of whom were later convicted of war crimes. Some, including camp commandant Rudolf Höss, were executed. The Allied Powers refused to believe early reports of the atrocities at the camp, and their failure to <b>bomb</b> <b>the</b> camp or its railways remains controversial. One hundred forty-four prisoners are known to have escaped from Auschwitz successfully, and on 7 October 1944, two Sonderkommando units—prisoners assigned to staff the gas chambers—launched a brief, unsuccessful uprising.|$|E

5|$|Phat was {{supposed}} to seize the Bien Hoa Air Base to prevent air force chief Kỳ from mobilising air power against them, but he failed to reach the airfield before Kỳ, who circled Tan Son Nhut and threatened to <b>bomb</b> <b>the</b> rebels. Most of {{the forces of the}} III and IV Corps surrounding the capital disliked both Khánh and the rebels, and took no action. However, as night came, senior military opinion began to turn against Thảo and Phát, although it was not clear at this stage whether the anti-Thảo forces being organised and led by Thi were hostile to Khánh as well.|$|E
