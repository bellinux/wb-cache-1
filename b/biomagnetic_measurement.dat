First, because the initial <b>biomagnetic</b> SQUID <b>measurements</b> were made about 3 km away in Cambridge (in 1969), this Boston area seems to be called "the birthplace of biomagnetism " [Science, 1989], so in a sense we are returning to the birthplace. Second, the first of these conferences on Biomagnetism took place in Cambridge (in 1976), so at this 14 th conference we have come full circle, returning to the Boston area where these conferences began. I will here summarize both of these seminal events. But first I'll say something about the biomag period before the 1969 "birth". THE PRE-SQUID PERIOD (1963 - 69) This period began with the first valid biomagnetic recording by Baule and McFee [Baule, 1963], in Syracuse, NY. This was a measurement of the magnetic field of the human heart (the first magnetocardiogram, or MCG); this was recorded outdoors in an open field, far from urban magnetic disturbances. As a detector they used two identical coils connected in series; each contained millions of turns around a ferrite core. These were placed parallel to each other on the subject's chest. The induced currents from a distant background disturbance would presumably be identical in the two coils, hence they would be cancelled. But the heart's field, because it has a gradient over the chest, would produce a net measurable signal. The recording was very noisy, even after signal-averaging, but was indeed valid. In subsequent publications, they also introduced important theoretical concepts into biomagnetics such as the lead-field, and the zero field due to a radial dipole [Baule, 1965]. * This work also stimulated several other groups to use similar coil systems for heart measurements. However, both the magnetic background noise and the intrinsic noise of these crude detectors discouraged widespread interest. In my own case, I had a different approach: using a magnetically shielded room to reduce the background noise. I also used a smaller coil and better amplifier, hence was able to record th...|$|R
