5|$|In 1832, at age 23, Lincoln and {{a partner}} bought a small general store on credit in New Salem, Illinois. Although the economy was booming in the region, the {{business}} struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share. That March he began his political career with his first campaign for the Illinois General Assembly. He had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural raconteur in New Salem, though he lacked an education, powerful friends, and money, which may <b>be</b> <b>why</b> he lost. He advocated navigational improvements on the Sangamon River.|$|E
5|$|Again {{disappointed}} with Hollywood, Wong returned to Britain, where she stayed {{for nearly three}} years. In addition to appearing in four films she toured Scotland and Ireland {{as part of a}} vaudeville show. She also appeared in the King George Silver Jubilee program in 1935. Her film Java Head (1934), though generally considered a minor effort, was the only film in which Wong kissed the lead male character, her white husband in the film. Wong's biographer, Graham Russell Hodges, commented that this may <b>be</b> <b>why</b> the film remained one of Wong's personal favorites. While in London, Wong met Mei Lanfang, {{one of the most famous}} stars of the Beijing Opera. She had long been interested in Chinese opera and Mei offered to instruct Wong if she ever visited China.|$|E
5|$|Ownership of {{the region}} of Oltenia became a source of dispute between the Iazyges and the Roman empire. The Iazyges had {{originally}} occupied the area before the Dacians seized it; it was taken during the Second Dacian War by Trajan, who was determined to constitute Dacia as a province. The land offered a much more direct connection between Moesia and the new Roman lands in Dacia, which may <b>be</b> <b>why</b> Trajan was determined to keep it. The dispute led to war under Hadrian, with him invading the Iazyges. The exact terms of the peace treaty are not known, but {{it is believed that}} the Romans kept Oltenia in exchange for some form of concession, likely involving a one-time tribute payment. The Iazyges also took possession of Banat around this time, suggesting it may {{have been part of the}} treaty.|$|E

25|$|The golden ratio has the {{simplest}} expression (and slowest convergence) as a continued fraction expansion of any irrational number (see Alternate forms above).

25|$|Yet another belief {{was that}} the fairies were demons entirely. This belief became much more popular {{with the growth of}} Puritanism. The hobgoblin, once a {{friendly}} household spirit, became a wicked goblin. Dealing with fairies was in some cases considered a form of witchcraft and punished as such in this era. Disassociating himself from such evils may <b>be</b> <b>why</b> Oberon, in A Midsummer Night's Dream, carefully observed that neither he nor his court feared the church bells.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{researchers}} Saper and Stickgold {{point out}} that {{an essential part of}} memory and learning consists of nerve cell dendrites' sending of information to the cell body to be organized into new neuronal connections. This process demands that no external information is presented to these dendrites, and it is suggested that this may <b>be</b> <b>why</b> it is during sleep that memories and knowledge are solidified and organized. Giulio Tononi and Chiara Cirelli have focused on the process of forgetting by pruning weaker connections during sleep, to select important memories and enable future memory encoding. They further suggest that synaptic potentiation drives Process S (homeostatic need for sleep).|$|E

25|$|The Pharaoh ant is a {{polygynous}} {{species that}} has a relatively low worker to queen ratio of around 12.86. This allows the pharaoh ants {{to be able to}} exert social control over the size of the colony and the size of each caste. In the average nest, there are around 170 ± 8 queens every nest, which comprises around 5.2% of the total population, whereas there are around 2185 ± 49 workers, which make up around 66.6% of the population. This low worker to queen ratio is usually associated with swift changes in the nest and may <b>be</b> <b>why</b> pharaoh ants form many new nest buds quickly. To branch out and form a new bud nest, pharaoh ants need a minimum of 469 ± 28 individuals, which explains how they proliferate so quickly.|$|E
25|$|Childhood amnesia (also {{known as}} {{infantile}} amnesia) {{is the common}} inability to remember events from one's own childhood. Sigmund Freud notoriously attributed this to sexual repression, while modern scientific approaches generally attribute it to aspects of brain development or developmental psychology, including language development, which may <b>be</b> <b>why</b> people do not easily remember pre-language events. Researchers have found that implicit memories cannot be recalled or described. Remembering {{how to play the}} piano is a common example of implicit memory, as is walking, speaking and other everyday activities that would be difficult to focus on if they had to be relearned every time one got up in the morning. Explicit memories, on the other hand, can be recalled and described in words. Remembering the first time meeting a teacher is an example of explicit memories.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the females}} in {{multiple}} foundress colonies, only one takes {{the role of}} queen and is the sole egg layer. The others work on the nest {{and care for the}} brood. Multiple foundress colonies do not have a greater per capita production rate but do have greater productivity overall compared to single-foundress colonies. It is suspected that competing interests of taking care of the queen's brood (indirect fitness) and seeking queenship and the chance to reproduce (individual fitness) prevent the efficiency that would lead to higher productivity in multi-foundress groups. Colonies with more than one founder are more likely to survive overall, which may <b>be</b> <b>why</b> individuals migrate into them more frequently than starting single-foundress colonies, even when the chances of taking over the role of queen are lower.|$|E
25|$|The rough side tears {{hold the}} air {{more easily than}} the shiny side valleys, so to {{maintain}} the air within the valleys the initial air layer must {{have a very high}} velocity, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> reverse swing <b>is</b> primarily, but not necessarily, achieved by fast bowlers.

25|$|It {{is highly}} likely that Eggestein even {{travelled}} to Mainz {{himself in the}} 1450s to learn the art of book printing from Gutenberg. When this was and how long the stay lasted cannot be definitely resolved, due to sketchy source materials. Ferdinand Geldner holds the view that Eggestein was already in Mainz in 1454 and that might <b>be</b> <b>why</b> he lost the office of Siegelbewahrer in Strasbourg in 1455. If this were the case, then he could have watched the printing of the 42-line-per-page Gutenberg Bible firsthand. Geldner further suspects that Heinrich Eggestein actively participated in the typesetting and printing of the Türkenkalender, which was completed {{in the middle of}} December in 1454. He did not give up his Strasbourg citizen's rights until August 1457, however. If he had left Alsace so late, he would have admittedly arrived in Mainz after the break between Gutenberg and Johann Fust.|$|E
25|$|Post-Caudal: While {{alligators}} and caimans have DPRs only {{on their}} jaws, crocodiles have similar organs on almost every scale on their bodies. The function of the DPRs on the jaws is clear; to catch prey, {{but it is still}} not clear what the function is of the organs {{on the rest of the}} body. The receptors flatten when exposed to increased osmotic pressure, such as that experienced when swimming in sea water hyperosmotic to the body fluids. When contact between the integument and the surrounding sea water solution is blocked, crocodiles are found to lose their ability to discriminate salinities. It has been proposed that the flattening of the sensory organ in hyperosmotic sea water is sensed by the animal as “touch”, but interpreted as chemical information about its surroundings. This might <b>be</b> <b>why</b> in alligators they are absent on the rest of the body.|$|E
25|$|A 2011 {{systematic}} review of {{systematic review}}s (internationally and without language restrictions) found that serious complications following acupuncture {{continue to be}} reported. Between 2000 and 2009, ninety-five cases of serious adverse events, including five deaths, were reported. Many such events are not inherent to acupuncture but are due to malpractice of acupuncturists. This might <b>be</b> <b>why</b> such complications have not been reported in surveys of adequately-trained acupuncturists. Most such reports originate from Asia, which may reflect {{the large number of}} treatments performed there or a relatively higher number of poorly trained Asian acupuncturists. Many serious adverse events were reported from developed countries. These included Australia, Austria, Canada, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US. The number of adverse effects reported from the UK appears particularly unusual, which may indicate less under-reporting in the UK than other countries. Reports included 38 cases of infections and 42 cases of organ trauma. The most frequent adverse events included pneumothorax, and bacterial and viral infections.|$|E

25|$|Numbers {{of mature}} adult Galápagos green turtle are {{much lower than}} those of other green sea turtle populations; this may <b>be</b> <b>why</b> they are more genetically {{isolated}} than other populations. The carapace is dark in color, usually black to dark olive-brown, is oval in shape, and tapers toward the tail. The carapace has a distinctive formation that is more sloped or domed than individuals of other populations. The five vertebral scutes are all alike in size with a hexagonal shape and flat edges. The lateral scutes are similar in size, but only four occur along each side. The carapace is tougher than the plastron, or the underside of the shell, and is also darker in pigmentation. They have been recorded up to 84cm in length, while other green sea turtles have been recorded up to 99cm in length. Their legs are shaped like flippers to aide in swimming; they are broad and generally flattened. The head is rounded and lizard-like with no teeth and does not have the predominantly hooked beak like many other green sea turtles. The sexes are similar in most aspects except size; the females are slightly larger, and the males have a longer tail.|$|E
25|$|STEC-HUS occurs after {{ingestion}} of {{a strain of}} bacteria expressing Shiga toxin(s), usually types of E. coli, that expresses verotoxin (also called Shiga-like toxin). E. coli can produce stx1 and/or stx2 Shiga toxins, the latter being more dangerous and {{a combination of both}} toxins in certain ratios is usually associated with HUS. These Shiga toxins bind GB3 receptors, globotriaosylceramide, which are present in renal tissue more than any other tissue and are also found in central nervous system neurons and other tissue. Children have more GB3 receptors than adults which may <b>be</b> <b>why</b> children are more susceptible to HUS. Cattle, swine, deer, and other mammals do not have GB3 receptors, but can be asymptomatic carriers of Shiga toxin-producing bacteria. Some humans can also be asymptomatic carriers. Once the bacteria colonizes, diarrhea followed by bloody diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, typically follows. HUS develops about 5–10 days after onset of diarrhea, with decreased urine output (oliguria), blood in the urine (hematuria), kidney failure, thrombocytopenia (low levels of platelets) and destruction of red blood cells (microangiopathic hemolytic anemia). Hypertension is common. In some cases, there are prominent neurologic changes.|$|E

Ironically, she demonstrates good acting ability in Twilight when she makes her father believe that she has dumped Edward and is leaving Forks. She is a very shy and timid girl with a stiff uptight position, habit of biting her lip, which she shares with Kristen Stewart. Bella knits together her eyebrows when feeling strong emotions such as anxiety. As a human, Bella easily fainted at the sight or smell of blood, which she said smells like rust and salt in Twilight, though it changes after she became a vampire. Bella is also shown in Breaking Dawn, to have a good mood climate, and is able to run away from the smell of human blood when she goes on her first hunting trip as a vampire.|$|E
