30|$|A multi-layered methodology, called phishGILLNET, is {{proposed}} and evaluated for phishing detection. All three layers of phishGILLNET employ PLSA to discover phishing and non-phishing topics. phishGILLNET 1 categorizes unseen data using Fisher similarity. phishGILLNET 2 employs AdaBoost using PLSA topic features and <b>builds</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> classifier than phishGILLNET 1. phishGILLNET 3 <b>builds</b> <b>a</b> robust classifier using {{only a fraction}} of labeled samples and applying Co-Training to label additional samples. The novelty of this architecture comes from employing semantic features to build the detection model. Intentional misspelled words found in phishing are handled using Levenshtein editing and Google APIs for correction before building the TDF matrix. One of the important contributions of this article is the use of Co-Training on a large corpus of unlabeled data to detect phishing attacks.|$|R

5000|$|Algebra tiles are {{mathematical}} manipulatives {{that allow}} students to better understand ways of algebraic thinking and the concepts of algebra. These tiles have proven to provide concrete models for elementary school, middle school, high school, and college-level introductory algebra students. They have also been used to prepare prison inmates for their General Educational Development (GED) tests. Algebra tiles allow both an algebraic and geometric approach to algebraic concepts. They give students another way to solve algebraic problems other than just abstract manipulation. The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) recommends a decreased emphasis on the memorization {{of the rules of}} algebra and the symbol manipulation of algebra in their Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for Mathematics.
