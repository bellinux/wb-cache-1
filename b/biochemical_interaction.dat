Receptor sites have specific affinities for drugs based on the chemical structure of the drug, {{as well as the}} specific action that occurs there.

40|$|Cells {{generate}} various biological rhythms {{that control}} {{important aspects of}} cell physiology including circadian (daily) events, cell division, embryogenesis, DNA damage repair and metabolism. Since these cellular rhythms can determine the fitness or fate of organisms, how cells generate and control rhythms has become a central problem in biology. In this dissertation, we have developed theorems and mathematical models to understand how complex biochemical interactions of many genes and proteins generate and control biological rhythms {{over a wide range}} of conditions. In chapter 2, we have developed a mathematical theory that can infer <b>biochemical</b> <b>interaction</b> network of cellular clocks from timecourse data of gene and protein expression, which are relatively easy to be measured with the recent advances in experimental technology. We formulated this question as an existence and uniqueness problem and proved that the <b>biochemical</b> <b>interaction</b> network, and even biochemical rates, can sometimes uniquely be determined from only gene and protein timecourses. This theory provides a simple algorithm to determine whether two given species have a <b>biochemical</b> <b>interaction.</b> In chapter 3, we have found how cells generate rhythms with a constant period over a wide range of environmental conditions by studying circadian rhythms whose 24 hr period is tightly regulated. By developing the most detailed and accurate mathematical model of circadian clock to date, we found that balancing a 1 - 1 stoichiometry between activators and repressors via double negative feedback loops is a key mechanism that tightly regulates the period of circadian rhythms. This mechanism provides an explanation for why various types of circadian disorders fail to regulate rhythms. In chapter 4, we considered rhythms of p 53, {{one of the most important}} tumor suppressors. Unlike self-sustained circadian rhythms, p 53 rhythms only occur in response to external stimuli such as DNA damage. Sustaining p 53 rhythms is essential for p 53 to repair DNA damage. By developing a mathematical model of p 53 rhythms, we found that additional positive feedback loops via Rora and Cyt-c can significantly improve the sustainability of p 53 rhythms in the presence of genetic heterogeneity and stochasticity...|$|E

40|$|Background: The World Wide Web plays a {{critical}} role in enabling molecular, cell, systems and computational biologists to exchange, search, visualize, integrate, and analyze experimental data. Such efforts can be further enhanced through the development of semantic web concepts. The semantic web idea is to enable machines to understand data through the development of protocol free data exchange formats such as Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL). These standards provide formal descriptors of objects, object properties and their relationships within a specific knowledge domain. However, the overhead of converting datasets typically stored in data tables such as Excel, text or PDF into RDF or OWL formats is not trivial for nonspecialists and as such produces a barrier to seamless data exchange between researchers, databases and analysis tools. This problem is particularly of importance in the field of network systems biology where <b>biochemical</b> <b>interactions</b> between genes and their protein products are abstracted to networks. Results: For the purpose of converting <b>biochemical</b> <b>interactions</b> into the BioPAX format, which is the leading standard developed by the computational systems biology community, we developed an open-source command line tool that takes as input tabular data describing different types of molecular <b>biochemical</b> <b>interactions.</b> The tool converts such interactions into the BioPAX level 3 OWL format.

40|$|Bloom’s {{syndrome}} (BS) is {{a disorder}} associated with chromosomal instability and a predisposition {{to the development}} of cancer. The BS gene product, BLM, is a DNA helicase of the RecQ family that forms a complex in vitro and in vivo with topoisomerase IIIα. Here, we show that BLM stimulates the ability of topoisomerase IIIα to relax negatively supercoiled DNA. Moreover, DNA binding analyses indicate that BLM recruits topoisomerase IIIα to its DNA substrate. Consistent with this, a mutant form of BLM that retains helicase activity, but is unable to bind topoisomerase IIIα, fails to stimulate topoisomerase activity. These results indicate that a physical association between BLM and topoisomerase IIIα is a prerequisite for their functional <b>biochemical</b> <b>interaction...</b>|$|E

40|$|Many {{bacteria}} use a type III secretion {{system to}} inject effector proteins into host cells. Selection and export of the effectors {{is controlled by}} a set of soluble proteins at the cytosolic interface of the membrane spanning type III secretion “injectisome”. Combining fluorescence microscopy, <b>biochemical</b> <b>interaction</b> studies and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we show that in live Yersinia enterocolitica bacteria these soluble proteins form complexes both at the injectisome and in the cytosol. Binding to the injectisome stabilizes these cytosolic complexes, whereas the free cytosolic complexes, which include the type III secretion ATPase, constitute a highly dynamic and adaptive network. The extracellular calcium concentration, which triggers activation of the T 3 SS, directly influences the cytosolic complexes, possibly through the essential component SctK/YscK, revealing a potential mechanism involved in the regulation of type III secretion...|$|E

We have applied this methodology to study the interconnection of two Boolean models to explore bacterial growth and its interactions with the cellular gene expression machinery, with a focus on growth dynamics as a function of ribosomes, RNA polymerase and other "bulk" proteins inside the cell.
