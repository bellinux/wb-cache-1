40|$|Energy plants, {{cultivated}} on set-aside land, could substitute nearly 3 % of {{the primary}} energy in Germany and could raise the income of farmers. However, the substitution of fossil fuels by plants requires the selection of plant species with high site suitability, an ecologically benign farming system and high yields. If these requirements are satisfied, a durable economic and ecological advantage, {{as well as the}} acceptance by politics and the public can be expected. Method and Material A field trial site was established as a split-plot on sandy soil (Sl, Albic Luvisol) in Potsdam-Bornim in 1994. On 3 hectares of land ten different annual and perennial energy plants intended for combustion were tested under comparable soil and climate conditions (540 mm/a; 9, 4 °C). Objects of the evaluation were plant species such as cocksfoot grass, poplar, willow, Jerusalem artichoke and hemp, as well as energy cereals such as triticale, winter rye and perennial rye. The yearly nitrogen-fertilisation was carried out at three intensity levels from 0 up to 150 kg N/ha for each crop. For <b>base</b> <b>fertilising</b> conventional mineral fertilisers were used, as well as straw and wood ash. Pesticides have not been applied so far. The measuring programme includes the evaluation of yields and ecologically relevant plant and soil contents, as well as nutrient circulation and accompanying faunistic studies [1]...|$|E
40|$|On 18 December 2014, in International Stem Cell Corporation v. Comptroller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks (C- 364 / 13), the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) {{delivered}} {{an important}} decision regarding {{the scope of}} the exclusion from patentability on morality-related grounds under Article 6 (2) of the EU Biotech Directive. The Court made an important distinction between embryonic stem cell technologies <b>based</b> on <b>fertilised</b> human ovum and those based on unfertilised human ovum stimulated by parthenogenesis. The CJEU held, in particular, that a human ovum: (i) who is unfertilized and (ii) whose division and further development has been stimulated by parthenogenesis, is not a human embryo under Article 6 (2) (c) of the Biotech Directive, if it in itself has not the inherent capacity of developing into a human being, this matter to be ascertained by the national court in the light of current scientific knowledge. By doing so, the Court clarified its previous ruling in Brüstle (October 2011) ...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} photosynthesis acceptor – leaf area vary among cultivation measures {{and it is}} limited factor for creating exact growth models in common winter wheat. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate changes of leaf area index (LAI) affected by agricultural treatments – 4 sowing rates and 9 nitrogen treatments <b>based</b> on <b>fertilising</b> rates, target values based on soil mineral nitrogen and plant sap tests target values including different varieties. Increasing sowing rates from 350 to 800 viable seeds m- 2 increased LAI at EC 75 stage from 2. 9 to 5. 5, where LAI 4. 1 at 500 seeds m- 2 did not vary between lower and higher rates; also at EC 85 stage LAIs did not differ significantly. At EC 75 stage LAI differed among control and nitrogen treatments from 1. 0 to 6. 5 and at EC 85 stage from 0. 1 to 2. 4, with differences in interaction among varieties. Higher nitrogen rates for first and second top dressing increased LAI in both stages compared without dressing treatments. Due to significant differences among LAI as consequence of production system, we suggest to take this into account in every prediction and modelling of growth in winter wheat...|$|R
40|$|Sex {{allocation}} {{and sexual}} selection have been heavily studied, but rarely linked. In this thesis I investigated {{the interface between}} them in the gregarious parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis, both directly and through their interactions with the mating system and sexual conflict. Chapter 2 investigated sexual selection and mating at the natal site: earlier eclosing males mated more females independently of body size. Nasonia follows Local Mate Competition, which describes how a female laying eggs alone {{on a patch of}} resources (a so-called single-foundress) should lay an extremely female-biased brood to minimise competition between her sons, yet ensure all her daughters are <b>fertilised.</b> <b>Based</b> on this I predicted that males with with fewer brothers would be better inseminators. Despite finding significant among-strain variation in (1) single-foundress sex ratio, (2) mate competitiveness when alone and (3) when in competition, (4) sperm resources, but not (5) sperm-depletion (Chapters 3 & 4), I did not find the predicted relationship. Conversely males from strains with more brothers had a higher mating success under competition (Chapter 3) leading to the question: does mating success select on sex ratio or vice versa? Either way it is a result of an interaction between sexual selection and sex allocation. Chapter 5 investigated the role of male post-copulatory courtship on female re-mating, and found that among-strain variation in female re-mating was not associated with variation in the duration of the post-copulatory courtship. Chapter 6 reviewed sexual conflict in the Hymenoptera: their haplodiploid genetics, newly sequenced genomes and varied life-histories provides a base for future research to build on. Finally I highlight the novel links between sexual selection, sex allocation, sexual conflict and the mating system found during my studies that will hopefully prompt future research on this topic...|$|R

What are the tasks of agricultural machinery and agricultural engineering research in organic farming? Which agricultural engineering results support {{the basic principles of}} organic farming? Hypothesis: Future agricultural engineering for organic farming embraces three essential areas: support of animal welfare, use of renewable energy, and strengthening sustainable crop production. Modern gantry technology offers ideal support for organic crop production objectives. Method: A literature review of scientific gantry research publications within the past ten years. Results/discussion: Present gantry research results show that gantry technology saves energy and work, increases profitability, improves and preserves soil structure, extends working time periods and assures timeliness of critical operations, offers independence frm weather and day light during field work, allows precise fertiliser distribution and irrigation, supports high precision intra-row weed control, field mapping for various objectives, automation of repeating work steps, automated ope rations by computer vision, and grants better working conditions. Gantry technology may in future support organic crop production by · continuous mapping of plot specific soil and flora data, · plot mapping for habitat specific operations, · cultivation of perennial vegetation covering, · mixed cropping/alley cropping systems using allelopathic effects for weed and pest resistance, · precise distribution of compost and preparations, · in time sowing, in time weed and pest control, · mulch <b>based</b> cultivating and <b>fertilising.</b> Gantry technology renders excellent opportunity for transdisciplinary research and co-operation between life scientists and engineers. Scientists from different disciplines are required for measuring and observation of biodiversity indicators, energy balance, soil tilth, nutrient balance, quality of work, and quality of products. Dynamic observation methods like appearance of plants during all stages of development using computer vision and image-processing methods may support human observation. The habitat specific information can be used to plan a crop rotation including mixed cropping or strip cultivation solu-tions, green mulch fertilisation, and allelopathic effects best suited for a given plot or even for a specific location of a given plot.
