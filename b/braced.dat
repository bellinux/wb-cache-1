We further developed the <b>brace</b> 2000 in the Maastricht <b>brace</b> (M <b>brace)</b> to enhance the effectivity of the <b>brace</b> and its wearing comfort. Materials and methods Pressure measurements were performed in 4 patients wearingtheBostonbraceandtheMbracetounderstand the efficacy between the two <b>braces</b> without intervariability [1, 2]. Results The mean primary right thoracic curve was 29 ° uncorrected; the mean secondary curve measured 19 °.

50|$|Back <b>braces</b> {{are also}} {{commonly}} prescribed to treat adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, {{as they may}} stop the progression of spinal curvature in a growing child/adolescent. In some cases, the back <b>brace</b> may also help decrease the amount of curvature in the spine. A variety of <b>brace</b> styles are available; the Boston <b>brace</b> is {{the most commonly used}} <b>brace</b> for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Other designs include the Milwaukee <b>brace,</b> the Charleston bending <b>brace,</b> the Peak Scoliosis <b>Bracing</b> System, and the SpineCor (a soft <b>brace)</b> in the United States, Canada and Europe. In Europe, however, the SPoRT and Cheneau and Crass Cheneau <b>braces</b> are also used. There has been considerable research and information published in reputable journals on back <b>braces</b> for scoliosis. Issues like patient compliance with treatment, psycho-social impact of <b>brace</b> use, and exercise with <b>bracing</b> have been looked at.

40|$|Background. Shoulder {{external}} rotation <b>braces</b> {{used for}} patients with a first-time shoulder dislocation are designed {{with a variety of}} arm positions in abduction as well as external rotation. However, few studies have focused on their immobilizing performance, comfort, or user-friendliness. Especially, there have been no robust data of shoulder abduction-external rotation (A-ER) <b>braces</b> in comparison to those of external rotation (ER) <b>braces.</b> Methods. Four types of commercially available shoulder <b>braces</b> (two ER and two A-ER <b>braces)</b> were tested in 30 healthy participants. The angles of external rotation and abduction were measured for each <b>brace</b> at initial application, after simulated daily activities, and after reapplication. Then, subjects were asked to assess the discomfort of <b>bracing</b> and difficulty of reapplication using a visual analogue scale. Data were compared between the two ER <b>braces</b> and two A-ER <b>braces</b> as well as among the four <b>braces.</b> Results. For both external rotation angle and subjective assessment, {{there were no significant differences}} between the ER and A-ER <b>braces.</b> Among the four <b>braces,</b> the measurement of arm position demonstrated no significant differences, except the external rotation angles between the two ER <b>braces.</b> The A-ER <b>braces</b> were assessed to be significantly less comfortable than the ER <b>braces</b> in the subjective assessment. Conclusions. Immobilization using the A-ER <b>braces</b> could maintain the arm position in abduction-external rotation with comparable user-friendliness, although they tended to be less comfortable during daily activities compared to the ER <b>braces...</b>|$|R

5|$|After the {{foundation}} of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932, the mosque underwent several major modifications. In 1951 King Ibn Saud (1932–1953) ordered demolitions around the mosque to make way for new wings to the east and west of the prayer hall, which consisted of concrete columns with pointed arches. Older columns were reinforced with concrete and <b>braced</b> with copper rings at the top. The Suleymaniyya and Majidiyya minarets were replaced by two minarets in Mamluk revival style. Two additional minarets were erected to the northeast and northwest of the mosque. A library was built along the western wall to house historic Qurans and other religious texts.|$|E
5|$|Other rooms {{include the}} casino, where creatures gamble for either {{pleasure}} {{or to be}} exploited for gold, the Workshop, where traps and doors are produced, the torture chamber, where creatures are tortured. Traps include the Sentry trap, which shoots nearby enemy creatures, the Fear trap, which scares enemies away, and the Alarm trap, which alerts its owner if it detect enemy creatures nearby. Doors block enemies while still allowing its owner's creatures passage. They come in various forms, such as Wooden, <b>Braced,</b> Secret, and Magic. Secret doors imitate walls, and Magic doors defend themselves by shooting enemy creatures. Bridges connect areas and facilitate transport over water and lava tiles, the latter harming most creatures and burning Wooden Bridges. Stone Bridges are immune.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Bracing</b> {{elements}} and their connections {{have played a}} key role in the steel <b>bracing</b> frame energy dissipation through yielding and buckling. Whereas it is normally expected that gusset plates yield and buckle after that of <b>bracing</b> elements. Moreover, <b>bracing</b> elements buckling go with the plastic hinge formation in gusset plates. However, the geometry requirement to provide plastic hinge formation leads to larger and consequently thicker gusset plate. This article presents a research concerning steel <b>bracing</b> connection detail. In this proposed steel <b>bracing</b> connection, Hinge Plate manages the formation of the plastic hinge in the <b>bracing</b> connections. To verify the proposed idea a monotonic compression test was conducted on a <b>bracing</b> element; that was detailed with Hinge Plate. As a primary observational goal of the test, buckling mode of <b>bracing</b> element was depicted to be well managed by Hinge Plate. In addition, it was observed that the hierarchy of yielding in <b>bracing</b> element and then in Hinge Plate coincided with expected energy dissipation requirement in <b>bracing</b> frame...|$|R

5|$|The Nclass {{incorporated}} {{the principles of}} power and reliability established by George Churchward, using a Belpaire firebox that sloped downwards towards the cab instead of a round-topped version, a regulator located in the smokebox, long-travel valves for free running up to , a sharply tapered and domeless boiler, and a right-hand driving position. These features are attributed to Holcroft, {{who worked on the}} GWR 4300class before joining the SECR. The boiler was intended to become a standard component for use on future SECR locomotive designs, thereby reducing building times and improving organisation at the works. The size was constrained by the heavier axle-loading of Maunsell’s proposed 2-6-4 tank locomotive variant of the Nclass, the Kclass, and was consequently smaller than was otherwise possible on the 2-6-0 chassis. The need to reduce overall weight also meant that the latter would feature lightly <b>braced</b> frames.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1987–88 season Vanbiesbrouck {{was hit by}} a puck {{under his}} mask in practice, which caused a non-displaced {{fracture}} of his lower jaw and a broken tooth.

5|$|With {{the decline}} in the empire's {{resources}} following losses in population and territory, domes in Byzantine architecture were used as part of more modest new buildings. The large-scale churches of Byzantium were, however, kept in good repair. The upper portion of the Church of Hagia Irene was thoroughly rebuilt after an earthquake in 740. The nave was re-covered with an elliptical domical vault hidden externally by a low cylinder on the roof, in place of the earlier barrel vaulted ceiling, and the original central dome from the Justinian era was replaced with one raised upon a high windowed drum. The barrel vaults supporting these two new domes were also extended out over the side aisles, creating cross-domed units. By bracing the dome with broad arches on all four sides, the cross-domed unit provided a more secure structural system. These units, with most domes raised on drums, became a standard element on a smaller scale in later Byzantine church architecture, and all domes built after the transitional period were <b>braced</b> with bilateral symmetry.|$|E
