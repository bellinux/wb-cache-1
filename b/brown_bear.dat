5|$|The {{official}} logo of {{this edition}} of the Mediterranean Games featured simple graphical illustrations of mountains and sea of the Abruzzo region. Pescara is the capital of Province of Pescara which is situated in the Abruzzo region. The official mascot was a Marsican <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> called Aua`, wearing a diving mask and flip-flops with swimfins in his hands. The Marsican <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> is a highly threatened, unrecognised subspecies of the <b>Brown</b> <b>bear,</b> with a range restricted to the Abruzzo National Park. The mascot was unveiled by the Mediterranean Games Executive Committee during their meeting in Pescara from 24 to 28 March 2008.|$|E
5|$|Other {{wildlife}} includes bharal, pheasants, roe deer, Thorold's deer, Mongolian gazelle, Siberian ibex, otter, <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> {{snow leopard}} and duck.|$|E
25|$|Amur tigers {{regularly}} prey {{on young}} <b>bears</b> and sub-adult <b>brown</b> <b>bears.</b> Reports of preying on fully grown small female adult Ussuri <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> {{by a big}} male tiger are common as well. Predation by tigers on denned <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> was not detected during a study carried between 1993 and 2002. Ussuri <b>brown</b> <b>bears,</b> along with the smaller Asian black bears constitute 2.1% of the Siberian tiger's annual diet, of which 1.4% are <b>brown</b> <b>bears.</b> Certain tigers {{have been reported to}} imitate the calls of Asian black bears to attract them.|$|R

5|$|Polar {{bears are}} thought to have diverged from a {{population}} of brown bears, Ursus arctos, that became isolated during a period of glaciation in the Pleistocene or from the eastern part of Siberia, (from Kamchatka and the Kolym Peninsula). The oldest known polar bear fossil is a 130,000 to 110,000-year-old jaw bone, found on Prince Charles Foreland in 2004. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the polar bear diverged from the <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> roughly 150,000 years ago. Further, some clades of <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> as assessed by their mtDNA, are more closely related to polar bears than to other brown bears, meaning that the polar bear might not be considered a species under some species concepts.|$|E
5|$|Scotland's {{wildlife}} {{is typical}} of the north-west of Europe, although several of the larger mammals such as the lynx, <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> wolf, elk and walrus were hunted to extinction in historic times. There are important populations of seals and internationally significant nesting grounds for a variety of seabirds such as gannets. The golden eagle is something of a national icon.|$|E
5|$|The {{phylogeny}} of extant bear {{species is}} shown in a cladogram based on complete mitochondrial DNA sequences from Yu et al., 2007. The giant panda, followed by the spectacled bear are clearly the oldest species. The relationships of the other species are not very well resolved, though the polar bear and the <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> form a close grouping.|$|E
5000|$|Bear Grottos - Old home of <b>brown</b> <b>bears,</b> sloth bears, spectacled bears, and {{polar bears}}. This exhibit closed when <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> and polar bears {{were moved to}} the Great Bear Wilderness in 2010 and the sloth bears were moved into Fragile Hunters.|$|R
5|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>bears</b> {{typically}} dominate wolf packs in {{disputes over}} carcasses, while wolf packs mostly prevail against bears when defending their den sites. Both species kill each other's young. Wolves eat the <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> they kill, while <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> seem to only eat young wolves. Wolf interactions with American black bears are much rarer than with <b>brown</b> <b>bears,</b> because {{of differences in}} habitat preferences. The majority of black bear encounters with wolves occur in the species' northern range, with no interactions being recorded in Mexico. Wolves have been recorded on numerous occasions to actively seek out black bears in their dens and kill them without eating them. Unlike <b>brown</b> <b>bears,</b> black bears frequently lose against wolves in disputes over kills. While encounters with <b>brown</b> and black <b>bears</b> appear to be common, polar bears are rarely encountered by wolves, though there are two records of wolf packs killing polar bear cubs. Wolves also kill the cubs of Asian black bears.|$|R
50|$|An {{international}} study led by Penn State University and the University of Buffalo {{has estimated}} that polar <b>bears</b> split from <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> between 4 million and 5 million years ago. This would {{have been due to}} climate changes, which included ice ages. Hybrids have also been documented within the Northern Beaufort Sea of Arctic Canada. This is an area where the range of polar bears overlaps with the range of <b>brown</b> <b>bears.</b> Data was collected using the entire genome of three <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> and one black bear in comparison to one modern polar bear and one polar bear remains estimated at 120,000 years old. Data shows that the <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> and polar bears were isolated {{at the same time in}} which black bears became their own species. <b>Brown</b> <b>bears</b> and polar bears continued to remain isolated for a long period of time, theorized due to the presence of ice, before recent changes allowed polar <b>bears</b> and <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> to interbreed again. It is estimated that Polar <b>Bears</b> and <b>Brown</b> <b>Bears</b> began to interbreed again about 160,000 years ago. The study shows that previous estimates of Polar Bears only existing 600,000 years ago was wrong, and that they have in fact been around much longer - four to five million years ago. This research analysis in particular discovered more genetic similarities between the polar bears and ABC Islands <b>Brown</b> <b>Bears.</b> This indicates that the study of the ABC Islands Bears is also important to understanding the evolution of the polar bear.|$|R
5|$|The zoo {{was largely}} {{unaffected}} by war, though some animals were euthanised for safety reasons during the Second World War. After the war the park housed a <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> named Voytek {{who had served}} with the Polish military. In 1972 one of the zoo's king penguins {{was adopted by the}} Norwegian military.|$|E
5|$|Edward III added {{other types}} of animals, two lions, a leopard and two wildcats. Under {{subsequent}} kings, the number of animals grew to include additional cats of various types, jackals, hyenas, and an old <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> Max, gifted to Henry VIII by Emperor Maximilian. In 1436, {{during the time of}} Henry V, all of the lions died; Keeper William Kerby was terminated because of this.|$|E
5|$|Extant {{bears are}} found in sixty {{countries}} primarily in the Northern Hemisphere and are concentrated in Asia, North America, and Europe. An exception is the spectacled bear; native to South America, it inhabits the Andean region. The sun bear's range extends below the equator in Southeast Asia. The Atlas bear, a subspecies of the <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> was distributed in North Africa from Morocco to Libya, but it became extinct around the 1870s.|$|E
50|$|DNA studies {{indicate}} that some <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> are {{more closely related to}} polar bears than they are to other <b>brown</b> <b>bears.</b> All the Ursinae species (i.e., all bears except the giant panda and the spectacled bear) appear able to crossbreed.|$|R
25|$|The Asian black bear's range {{overlaps}} {{with that of}} sloth bears in central and southern India, sun bears in Southeast Asia and <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> {{in the southern part}} of the Russian Far East. Ussuri <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> may attack black <b>bears,</b> though Himalayan <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> seem to be intimidated by the black species in direct encounters. They will eat the fruit dropped by black bears from trees, as they themselves are too large and cumbersome to climb.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn the den, hibernating <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> do {{not develop}} tissue atrophy or organ damage, despite almost no {{physical}} activity. Mesenchymal stem cells could {{play an important}} role in tissue repair and regeneration in <b>brown</b> <b>bears.</b> Our objective was to determine if adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) can be recovered from wild Scandinavian <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> and characterize their differentiation potential. Following immobilization of wild <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> 7 â€“ 10 days after leaving the den in mid-April, adipose tissue biopsies were obtained. ASCs were recovered from 6 bears, and shown to be able to undergo adipogenesis and osteogenesis in monolayer cultures and chondrogenesis in pellet cultures. Remarkably, when grown in standard cell culture medium in monolayer cultures, ASCs from yearlings spontaneously formed bone-like nodules surrounded by cartilaginous deposits, suggesting differentiation into osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages. This ability appears to be lost gradually with age. This is the first study to demonstrate stem cell recovery and growth from <b>brown</b> <b>bears,</b> and it is the first report of ASCs spontaneously forming extracellular matrix characteristic of bone and cartilage in the absence of specific inducers. These findings could have implications for the use of hibernating <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> as a model to study disuse osteoporosis...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Beringian wolf, other Beringian carnivores include the Beringian cave lion (Panthera leo spelaea), scimitar-toothed cat (Homotherium serum), short-faced bear (Arctodus simus), and the omnivorous <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> (Ursus arctos). Beringian wolves would have faced competition for the carcasses of large herbivores from the formidable short-faced bear, a scavenger. Additionally, humans had reached the Bluefish Caves in the Yukon Territory by 24,000YBP, with cutmarks being found there on specimens of Yukon horse, steppe bison, caribou, wapiti (Cervus elaphus), and Dall sheep (Ovis dalli).|$|E
5|$|In some species, {{offspring}} {{may become}} independent {{around the next}} spring, through some may stay until the female successfully mates again. Bears reach sexual maturity shortly after they disperse; at around 3â€“6 years depending on the species. Male Alaskan brown bears and polar bears may continue to grow until they are 11 years old. Lifespan may also vary between species. The <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> can live an average of 25 years.|$|E
5|$|The area {{shares a}} common <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> {{population}} with Norway and Russia. Other predators include red fox, stoat, pine marten and the rare wolverine and Eurasian lynx. The gray wolf was common until the 1940s. There {{is also a}} large population of moose. Inariâ€“Pasvik has a shared population of 6,000 reindeer, which are herded to different areas depending on the season. Fences have been installed to hinder reindeer from wandering across the national borders.|$|E

Following immobilization of 8 wild <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> 7 - 10 days after leaving the den in mid-April, adipose tissue biopsies (5 - 8 ml) were obtained subcutaneously from 7 bears.

5000|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>bears</b> {{regularly}} intimidate gray wolves (Canis lupus) {{away from}} their kills, with wolves occurring {{in most of the}} <b>brown</b> <b>bear's</b> worldwide distribution. In Yellowstone National Park, <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> pirate wolf kills so often, Yellowstone's Wolf Project director Doug Smith wrote, [...] "It's not a matter of if the bears will come calling after a kill, but when." [...] Similarly, in Denali National Park, grizzly bears routinely rob wolf packs of their kills. On the contrary, in Katmai National Park and Preserve, wolves, even lone wolves, may manage to displace <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> at carrion sites. Despite the high animosity between the two species, most confrontations at kill sites or large carcasses end without bloodshed on either side. Though conflict over carcasses is common, on rare occasions the two predators tolerate each other on the same kill. To date, {{there are only a few}} cases of fully-grown wolves being killed by <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> and none of wolves killing healthy adult <b>brown</b> <b>bears.</b> Given the opportunity, however, both species will prey on the other's cubs. Conclusively, the individual power of the bear against the collective strength of the wolf pack usually results in a long battle for kills or domination.|$|R
50|$|In 2005 the {{presence}} of <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> was reported near the Portuguese border (less than 20 km) on the Trevinca range, based on footprints left on a big mud pad. It is very plausible that <b>brown</b> <b>bears,</b> nowadays, cross the border on some occasions.|$|R
5|$|The {{park has}} its western border {{running along the}} Finlandâ€“Norway border. The two most {{prominent}} lakes are Ellenvatn and Ã˜devatn, both of which flow into tributaries of the river Pasvikelva. The fauna and flora are typical of the Siberian taiga, and include some species uncommon for Norway. The park is a habitat for the <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> and also has a large population of moose; reindeer husbandry takes place during winter. Eight species of fish live in the lakes and the park has 190 species of flowering plants.|$|E
5|$|The series {{takes place}} over the span of six books, which are: The Quest Begins, Great Bear Lake, Smoke Mountain, The Last Wilderness, Fire in the Sky, and Spirits in the Stars. The story follows four young bears. Lusa, a black bear, Kallik, a polar bear, Toklo, a grizzly bear and Ujurak, {{who is able to}} shape-shift into any animal, but remains a <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> most of the time.|$|E
5|$|Although Louis {{signed an}} {{alliance}} with the Republic of Genoa in October 1352, he did not intervene in the Genoeseâ€“Venetian War, because his truce of 1349 with Venice was still in force. Louis married Elizabeth of Bosnia, who {{was the daughter of}} his vassal, Stephen II, in 1353. Historian Gyula KristÃ³ says that this marriage showed Louis's renewed interest in the affairs of the Balkan Peninsula. While he was hunting in ZÃ³lyom County (now in Slovakia) in late November 1353, a <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> attacked him, inflicting 24 wounds on his legs. Louis's life was saved by a knight of the court, John BesenyÅ‘, who killed the beast with his sword.|$|E
50|$|Aggressive {{behavior}} in <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> is favored by numerous selection variables. Unlike the smaller black <b>bears,</b> adult <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> are too large and have improperly shaped claws to escape danger by climbing trees, so {{they respond to}} danger by standing their ground and warding off their attackers. Increased aggressiveness also assists female <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> in better ensuring the survival of their young to reproductive age. Mothers defending cubs are the most prone to attacking, being responsible for 70% of brown bear-caused human fatalities in North America.|$|R
50|$|Beyond {{the regular}} {{predation}} of salmon, most <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> {{are not particularly}} active predators. Nonetheless, <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> are capable of obtaining practically all forms of the mammals that they encounter: from mouse-like rodents to those as fearsome as a tiger or {{as large as a}} bison. Over 100 species of mammal have been recorded either in the scats of <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> or have been observed as being killed or consumed by the species, although much of this consumption probably represents merely scavenging on carrion.|$|R

5|$|Bears {{have been}} hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; {{they have been}} used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment, such as being made to dance. With their {{powerful}} physical presence, they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human societies. In modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market. The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered, and even least concern species, such as the <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> are at risk of extirpation in certain countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{richness}} of high-quality habitats in Yosemite, the <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> California condor, and least Bell's vireo have become extinct in the park within historical time, and another 37 species currently have special status under either California or federal endangered species legislation. The most serious current threats to Yosemite's wildlife and the ecosystems they occupy include loss of a natural fire regime, exotic species, air pollution, habitat fragmentation, and climate change. On a more local basis, factors such as road kills {{and the availability of}} human food have affected some wildlife species.|$|E

In this study we assessed two procedures to cryopreserve skin biopsies from live <b>brown</b> <b>bears.</b> Skin biopsies were taken from six live, anesthetized <b>brown</b> <b>bears.</b> Single biopsies (n = 3) of each animal were {{cut into small pieces}} and assigned to one of the three experimental groups: freezing, vitrification, or untreated fresh. There were no differences on cell attachment. However, both freezing and fresh culture allowed for higher cell proliferation (p < 0. 05) and less days to reach 70 % to 80 % confluence (p < 0. 03) than vitrification. Skin biopsies from <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> can be preserved long term, allowing fibroblasts to proliferate in culture.
