5|$|In 1966, Williams {{became a}} {{professional}} musician and moved <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>London,</b> {{where he worked}} at a demolition site and in supermarkets, and played in short-lived bands. Williams met guitarist Laurie Wisefield (later a member of Wishbone Ash), and the two became members of a band, Sugar, which soon broke up.|$|E
5|$|The {{bodies of}} the two Neville {{brothers}} were brought <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>London.</b> They did not suffer the customary fate accorded to traitors—quartering and display at the city gates. Edward exhibited the brothers' naked corpses in St. Paul's Cathedral for three days to quell any rumours that they had survived, before allowing them to be laid {{to rest in the}} family vault at Bisham Abbey.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of World War II, the globes were sent to Beaconsfield and stored with part of the Wallace Collection at Hall Barn {{in the care of}} Lady Burnham. They were brought <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>London</b> in 1945 and were at one stage kept in the King's Library on loan to the British Museum. The globes were {{installed}} in their present position in the Middle Temple Library when the current library building opened in 1958. In 2003, they were loaned to the National Maritime Museum for an exhibition commemorating the life of Elizabeth I.|$|E

50|$|Although he {{remained}} with Southampton for the 1898-98 season, he only played twice. After 57 appearances for the Saints with 33 goals, he moved <b>back</b> <b>to</b> south-east <b>London</b> <b>to</b> join Sheppey United.|$|R
5|$|Great Britain VIII was a nine-day railtour from London to Cornwall, Scotland and <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>London.</b> Various steam {{locomotives}} {{were scheduled}} to haul the train on {{each day of the}} tour, which was to have been entirely steam hauled. Participants paid between £1,995 and £2,895 per person for the nine-day tour. Despite fears that the tour would be cancelled, it was run although with changes to the locomotives hauling it. DB Schenker agreed to operate the first two days of the tour. The tour suffered a number of issues including steam locomotives being replaced by diesels, and a lack of train heating; these resulted in a significant number of passengers leaving the tour early.|$|E
5|$|Hogg {{moved from}} York to London {{in the spring}} of 1812 to study law. He tried to conceal his {{political}} views from his classmates and spent long hours studying law and reading Greek literature. In 1813 Hogg reconciled with the Shelleys after they visited him in London. They remained in contact after the couple left on a journey to Wales and Ireland. In April 1814, Hogg went to Ireland in an attempt to cheer up Percy Shelley, who had complained of poor spirits in a letter. The Shelleys did not receive Hogg's last letter before he embarked on the journey and had left Dublin before he arrived. Unable to locate them, he returned home. Shelley soon travelled <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>London</b> as well.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, {{sessions}} for the album started, with recording {{taking place at}} three different studios in Kingston, Jamaica: Dynamic Sound, Harry J's and Randy's. Engineer Sylvan Morris put the songs on eight-track tape, and allocated tracks with the drum mixes on one track and piano and guitar together on another. In the winter of 1972, Marley flew <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>London</b> to present the master tapes. The deal with Island led to a dispute with CBS and Sims, to whom the band were already contracted. The Island Records label won the resulting court case, and it received US$9,000 and two percent of royalties from the band's first six albums, and Sims received 5,000 and the publishing rights to the Wailers songs.|$|E

5|$|Jeremy Wilkin as Virgil Tracy. David Holliday, the {{original}} voice of Virgil, {{had returned to}} the United States in the interim between the production of Series One and Thunderbirds Are Go. For the films and Series Two, the character was voiced by Wilkin, an English-born Canadian actor who emigrated <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>London</b> in the 1960s. Wilkin would maintain a professional relationship with the Andersons for seven years after the film, voicing the character of Captain Ochre in Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, supporting roles in Joe 90 and The Bishop in The Secret Service, as well as making minor appearances in the live-action Anderson productions Doppelgänger, UFO and The Protectors.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is left of}} the old Ashford town centre, {{apart from}} a cluster of medieval half-timbered {{buildings}} in Middle Row and around the churchyard in the town centre. A number of old buildings were removed {{to make way for the}} controversial ring road around the centre, including four public houses. Further demolition was required to build Charter House, an eight-story office building for Charter Consolidated, that opened in 1975. Charter subsequently moved <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>London</b> in 1985, and the building is now being converted into flats, though progress stalled owing to the discovery of asbestos. Charter compensated for the demolition by funding a restoration scheme on North Street, preserving several historic buildings.|$|E
5|$|Playing {{to small}} audiences, on tiny stages, in {{communal}} troupes where {{all but the}} stars had day jobs, and playing only Saturday and Sunday (the pious London Jews would never have tolerated Friday performances), Adler focused on serious theater like never before. However, he and Grodner soon fell out: they wrangled over ideology and over parts, and their verbal duels boiled over into improvised stage dialogue. The Grodners ultimately left to do theater {{in a series of}} other locations, notably Paris, but eventually came <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>London,</b> where Israel Grodner died in 1887.|$|E
50|$|South New London County Council #077 was {{headquartered}} in New London, Connecticut. The Council came about from a name change <b>to</b> New <b>London</b> Council in 1923. In 1929, the Council name was changed <b>back</b> <b>to</b> New <b>London</b> Council.|$|R

5|$|The {{family moved}} to Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire while Davison was still a baby; {{until the age of}} 11 she was educated at home. When her parents moved the family <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>London</b> she went to a day school, then spent a year {{studying}} in Dunkirk, France. When she was 13 she attended Kensington High School and later won a bursary to Royal Holloway College in 1891 to study literature. Her father died in early 1893 and she was forced to end her studies because her mother could not afford the fees of £20 a term.|$|E
5|$|A {{friend from}} the {{discussion}} group, who uses the handle Parkaboy, privately emails her saying {{a friend of a}} friend has discovered an encrypted watermark on one clip. They concoct a fake persona, a young woman named Keiko, to seduce the Japanese man who knows the watermark code. Cayce, along with an American computer security specialist, Boone Chu, hired to assist her, travels to Tokyo to meet the man and retrieve the watermark code. Two men attempt to steal the code but Cayce escapes and travels <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>London.</b> Boone travels to Columbus, Ohio to investigate the company that he believes created the watermark. Meanwhile, Blue Ant hires Dorotea who reveals that she was previously employed by a Russian lawyer whose clients have been investigating Cayce. The clients wanted Cayce to refuse the job of tracking the film clips and it was Dorotea's responsibility to ensure this.|$|E
5|$|Each {{station was}} {{built as a}} one-storey {{building}} around a square courtyard. The side adjacent to the railway line was left open, and wings extended from the building along the platform on each side. Other than the brick platform faces, chimneys and foundations, the stations were built entirely of wood. Each station held first class and ordinary reception rooms for mourners, a first class and an ordinary refreshment room, {{and a set of}} apartments for LNC staff. The refreshment rooms at both stations were licensed (permitted to sell alcohol). The train crews would generally wait in these refreshment rooms until the trains were ready to return to London, and on at least one occasion (on 12 January 1867) the driver became so drunk that the fireman had to drive the train <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>London.</b> This incident prompted a complaint from the LSWR and from that time the LNC provided the train crew with a free lunch, provided they drank no more than one pint of beer.|$|E
50|$|Salvage moved <b>back</b> <b>to</b> West <b>London</b> <b>to</b> join Division Two club Queens Park Rangers in March 1971. He {{failed to}} break through into the first team, making 24 {{appearances}} and scoring one goal before departing in February 1973.|$|R

5|$|Grace {{was living}} in Gloucestershire in 1878. He and his wife Agnes had moved to London in February 1875 when he was {{assigned}} to St Bartholomew's Hospital to further his medical education. They lived in an Earl's Court apartment until autumn 1877 when they returned to Gloucestershire and lived with Grace's elder brother Henry, who was a general practitioner (GP) at Kingswood, near Bristol. The Graces already had two sons and their third child Bessie was born in May 1878. When not playing cricket, Grace had to study a backlog of medical theory and, after the season ended, {{he was assigned to}} Westminster Hospital for his final year of medical practice; the family moved <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>London</b> and lived at Acton until he finally qualified in November 1879.|$|E
5|$|Grinsell {{was born}} in London on 14 February 1907. With his family, he moved to Brighton shortly after the First World War. There, his {{interest}} in archaeology was encouraged by H. S. Toms, the curator of Brighton Museum who had formerly been an assistant to the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers. Moving <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>London,</b> in 1925 Grinsell became a clerk for Barclays Bank. Although he had developed his interest in prehistory through an examination of stone tools, he came to focus his attention on barrows, recognising that these were among the least well understood prehistoric monuments in the British landscape {{and one of the}} few that could be studied from the position of an amateur. At the time, a number of antiquarians were still active in southern England, with Grinsell being encouraged in his interests by prominent figures in this milieu such as Eliot Curwen and Hadrian Allcroft.|$|E
5|$|In 1864 Brookwood (Necropolis) {{railway station}} on the LSWR opened, {{immediately}} east of Necropolis Junction. In conjunction with {{the building of the}} station a run-around loop was added at Necropolis Junction, allowing locomotives to reposition themselves from the front {{to the rear of the}} train. From then on, on arrival at Necropolis Junction from London the engine would not be repositioned, but would push the train into the cemetery from the rear, under the close supervision of LNC staff. This left the engine positioned to pull the train out of the cemetery, after which it would use the run-around loop to move to the other end of the train and pull it <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>London.</b> Between 1898 and 1904 the LSWR line through Brookwood was increased from two to four tracks; a thin slice of the northernmost part of the cemetery was ceded to the LSWR to allow the widening of the line. Brookwood station was rebuilt, and a new junction to the west of the station allowed trains to pass between the cemetery branch and all four of the LSWR lines.|$|E
50|$|New London Council #077 was {{headquartered}} in New London, Connecticut. Founded in 1918, {{the name was}} changed <b>to</b> South New <b>London</b> County in 1923. In 1929, the name was changed <b>back</b> <b>to</b> New <b>London</b> Council and remained until a name change in 1935 to Pequot Council.|$|R

5|$|In 1926 Harold Knight {{spent several}} {{months at the}} Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, in America, {{painting}} portrait commissions of surgeons. Laura joined him there and was given permission to paint at the Baltimore Children's Hospital and in the black wards of the racially segregated Johns Hopkins Hospital. Whilst in Baltimore Knight painted a nurse, Pearl Johnson, who took her to meetings and concerts of the early American civil rights movement. Knight also hired a mother and child model to pose for the composition originally known as the Madonna of the Cotton Fields. Knight took these paintings <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>London</b> with her and they feature in the Pathé newsreel produced to mark her election as an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1927. Another portrait of Johnson, Irene and Pearl, shows two women {{against a backdrop of}} skyscrapers and was {{one of a number of}} portraits Knight painted in the late 1920s that appear strikingly modern. Miss Ealand, shown at the Royal Academy in 1928, depicts a woman with cropped hair wearing a jacket and holding a gun. The same year Knight's portrait of a women saxophone player was displayed at the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC.|$|E
5|$|It was {{immediately}} {{agreed that the}} 1941 season of Proms should {{be held at the}} Albert Hall. It was twice the size of the Queen's Hall, with poor acoustics, but a six-week series was judged a success, and the Albert Hall remained the home of the Proms. Wood, aged seventy-two, was persuaded to have an associate conductor to relieve him of some of the burden. Basil Cameron undertook the task and remained a Prom conductor until his retirement, aged eighty, in 1964. The BBC brought its symphony orchestra <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>London</b> and resumed its backing of the Proms in 1942; Boult joined Cameron as Wood's associate conductor during that season. In early 1943, Wood's health deteriorated, and two days after the start of that year's season, he collapsed and was ordered to have a month in bed. Despite wartime vicissitudes, the 1943 season sold nearly 250,000 tickets, with an average audience of about 4,000 – many more than could have fitted into the Queen's Hall.|$|E
5|$|On 27 October 1469, Henry Percy {{had taken}} his oath of fealty to the King, and had been {{released}} from the Tower. The following year saw the return of Robin of Redesdale and another rebellion on behalf of Warwick. Montagu was forced to {{come down from the}} Scottish border to suppress it; this he did, but, one historian has suggested, albeit that he 'allowed the leaders to escape... ensuring that the rebellion could rise again' at a more opportune moment. Almost immediately, Montagu was forced to crush another rebellion, this time lead by a Robin of Holderness, but calling for the return of Percy to the Northumberland Earldom. The Redesdale rebels soon reformed into an army big enough to march south and defeat a royal force at the Battle of Edgecote Moor on 26 July 1469. King Edward still accepted that Montagu was uninvolved in his brother's rebellion, and in the event, Montagu was the only Neville to accompany the king on his journey from the north <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>London.</b>|$|E
