Training a machine is also known as supervised learning where an instance of a set of documents with pre-defined human-labelled categories are used for training.

A model is then used to test on a new set of document and produce an estimate of the category it falls into.|$|R

[...] "Audacity, completely unfounded self-confidence, utter ruthlessness and a fast car will, of course, be useful attributes to the go-ahead noise-pirate of the 90s, but skill, feel, instinct, vision—y'know, boring old talent—will still be bottom line compulsories... it's in these latter commodities that the JAMs seem conspicuously undertooled." [...] Compared to the output of DJ Code Money or Cut Creator ("all humour, vibrancy and colour... – aerosoled version of The Book of Kells") Kelly felt Drummond's efforts to be a [...] "glitter-crusted charity Christmas card".

40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{errors in}} two Old-Russian Apostolos manuscripts: Apostolus Christinopolitanus from the 12 th century (an {{example of the}} <b>commented</b> <b>type)</b> and Tolstovskiy Apostolus from the 14 th century (an example of the continuous type). The result {{of this research is}} new information about the reception of loan words, text reinterpretation, the influence of antigraphs and comments, and the personality of the Tolstovskiy scribe. The author corrects errors on both lexical and grammatical levels. Some of the lexical errors are provoked by deformations in the Greek text (homonym and paronym mixing). There are also various transformations of appellatives to onyms, and vice versa. All of this might occur in the antigraph {{as well as in the}} Tolstovskiy manuscript. Grammatical errors are fixed on the macro- and microlevels. There are cases of incorrect text segmentation within syntagms and between paragraphs in the Tolstovskiy manuscript which take place owing to the influence of the Praxapostolos and the <b>commented</b> <b>type</b> of Apostolos. Both manuscripts are also influenced by comments. This is reflected in grammatical and semantic alteration of the main text and, more rarely, in direct comments included in the main text, although the latter is not supposed for the continuous type to which the Tolstovskiy manuscript belongs. As for the chirographer of the Tolstovskiy manuscript, his background could not be characterized by a high level of literacy or by rich knowledge of the New Testament. He obviously did not have any Greek copies or more correct Slavonic copies at his disposal...|$|R

5000|$|Perhaps the <b>best</b> <b>comment</b> on Margaret's {{initiative}} in embarking on language processing research, and specifically on machine translation work, {{comes from a}} somewhat unexpected source. Machine translation, after an initial period of high hopes, and some large claims, was cast into outer darkness in 1966 by funding agencies who saw little return for their money. Reviewing twenty five years of artificial intelligence research in his presidential address to the American Association for Artificial Intelligence in 1985, Woody Bledsoe, one of the long-standing leaders of the field, though in areas quite outside language, said of those who attempted machine translation in the fifties and sixties: [...] "They may have failed, but they were right to try; we have learned so much from their attempts to do something so difficult".|$|R
