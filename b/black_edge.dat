25|$|The medal is {{suspended}} from a Russian pentagonal mount by a ring through the metal suspension loop.

25|$|It is {{also not}} {{difficult}} {{to see that this}} process is reversible: given any path P whose exceedance is less than n, there is exactly one path which yields P when the algorithm is applied to it. Indeed, the (<b>black)</b> <b>edge</b> X, which originally was the first horizontal step ending on the diagonal, has become the last horizontal step starting on the diagonal.|$|E

25|$|The golden trevally's colour is {{the species}} most {{prominent}} distinguishing feature, {{and for which}} it acquired its common names. Juveniles are a bright golden yellow colour over their entire body and all fins, with 7 to 11 black vertical crossbars all over their body. These bars generally alternate between broad and narrow. The caudal fin lobes have dark tips {{and there is a}} prominent <b>black</b> <b>edge</b> to the operculum. As the fish grows, the body becomes more silver to silvery golden and the cross bars fade or disappear, often replaced by dark blotches. The fins remain yellow, often with greenish tinges. The dark edge of the operculum also fades with age.|$|E
25|$|The large {{pectoral}} fins have strongly convex leading and concave trailing margins, and blunt tips. The pelvic fins are triangular {{with nearly}} straight margins. The first dorsal fin originates over the pectoral fin insertions, and is broadly triangular {{with a narrow}} apex and a concave trailing margin. The second dorsal fin measures about 67ndash&77% as tall as the first and is similar in shape; there is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins. The anal fin is almost {{as large as the}} second dorsal fin and lies slightly behind; it has a deep notch in the posterior margin. The caudal fin is asymmetrical; the lower lobe is narrow and well-developed, while the upper lobe has a gently convex upper margin and a prominent notch in the ventral margin near the tip. The body is covered by small, overlapping oval-shaped dermal denticles bearing three or five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species is plain slate-gray above, including the upper surfaces of the pectoral and pelvic fins, and the caudal fin; the underside is white. The boundary between dark and light runs through the bottom rim of the eye, through the gill slits, over the flank well above the pelvic fins, and onto the upper caudal fin lobe. The fins darken towards the posterior margins, forming a <b>black</b> <b>edge</b> on the upper caudal fin lobe; each pectoral fin also has a black blotch underneath, near the tip. The eyes are ringed in white.|$|E

60|$|And before Philip, {{his mind}} {{fixed on the}} photographs, had time to gather {{the meaning of the}} remark, Mr. Perkins was showing him a picture of Salamis, and with his finger, a finger of which the nail had a little <b>black</b> <b>edge</b> to it, was {{pointing}} out how the Greek ships were placed and how the Persian.|$|E

Gaunt ruinous masses of the building, mighty truncated piers and girders, rose dismally out of this cavernous darkness. And over these vestiges of some splendid place, countless minute men were clambering, leaping, swarming.|$|E

60|$|The {{letter was}} kindly expressed, {{but this was}} lost upon Marian in the pain its purport gave her, and the {{difficulty}} of composing an answer.

She would not even send her love to her cousins, for she said she could have no particular affection for them, and to express any pleasure in the prospect of seeing so many strangers would be an actual untruth.|$|E
60|$|We {{crossed the}} longer street, up which a clumsy steam tram, {{vomiting}} smoke and sparks, made its clangorous way, and adown which one saw the greasy brilliance of shop fronts and the naphtha flares of hawkers' barrows dripping fire into the night.

You cannot see these things as I can see them, nor can you figure--unless you know the pictures that great artist Hyde has left the world--the effect of the great hoarding by which we passed, lit below by a gas-lamp and towering up to a sudden sharp <b>black</b> <b>edge</b> against the pallid sky.|$|E
60|$|Then Mr. Hoopdriver {{returned}} to the little room with the lead-framed windows where he had dined, and where the bed was now comfortably made, {{sat down on the}} box under the window, stared at the moon rising on the shining vicarage roof, and tried to collect his thoughts. How they whirled at first! It was past ten, and most of Midhurst was tucked away in bed, some one up the street was learning the violin, at rare intervals a belated inhabitant hurried home and woke the echoes, and a corncrake kept up a busy churning in the vicarage garden. The sky was deep blue, with a still luminous afterglow along the <b>black</b> <b>edge</b> of the hill, and the white moon overhead, save for a couple of yellow stars, had the sky to herself.|$|E

60|$|How long I {{sat there}} on that dreary March morning I do not know, with the paper lying open and {{untouched}} before me, its <b>black</b> <b>edge</b> a fitting symbol of the dead hopes, whose tale I had to write upon it. Not that I think I looked at that; my eyes were fixed blankly on the wall before me; but not one word did I write, although all the time my hand held the pen ready to set down what my heart and brain should dictate. But nothing came; my heart seemed cold and dead, {{as if it could}} feel no motion, while my brain was in a strange whirl of thought, and yet no thought framed itself into any tangible shape. I hardly know what current they took, the past or the future; I cannot recall one single thought; indeed, I question if one stood out prominently enough among the others to have been seized, even at the time.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I.--A lady one day {{asked me}} to scry out a friend of whom she would think. Almost {{immediately}} I exclaimed [...] "Here is an old, old lady {{looking at me with}} a triumphant smile on her face. She has a prominent nose and nut-cracker chin. Her face is very much wrinkled, especially at the sides of her eyes, as if she were always smiling. She is wearing a little white shawl with a <b>black</b> <b>edge.</b> But! ... she can't be old as her hair is quite brown! although her face looks so very very old." [...] The picture then vanished, and the lady said that I had accurately described her friend's mother instead of himself; that it was a family joke that the mother must dye her hair, it was so brown and she was eighty-two years old. The lady asked me if the vision were distinct enough for me to recognise a likeness in the son's photograph; next day she laid several photographs before me, and in a moment, without the slightest hesitation I picked him out from his wonderful likeness to my vision!' ...|$|E

Then they skirmished up to the gate, and began the old game of calling our Pathans renegades, and invitin' 'em to join the holy war. One of our men, a young fellow from Dera Ismail, jumped on the wall to slang 'em back, and jumped down, blubbing like a child. He'd been hit {{smack in the middle of}} the hand. 'Never saw a man yet who could stand a hit in the hand without weepin' bitterly. It tickles up all the nerves. So Tertius took his rifle and smote the others on the head to keep them quiet at the loopholes.
