5|$|In her research, Fraser worked {{predominantly}} in infectious disease, studying general infection, puerperal fever, {{scarlet fever}} and septic sore throat among other bacterial infections. She began studies on scarlet fever {{in the early}} 1930s, and along with Dr. Helen Plummer isolated the precipitin present in the strains of streptococci {{likely to lead to}} disease. These findings were important in determining the types of antitoxins which might be employed for immunization to neutralize the disease. The type of research Fraser was engaged in required that the bacteria of the disease which created a toxin be isolated, so that it could be injected into a horse. Repeated injections of small doses of toxin allowed the horse to become immune to the disease. The serum created from the blood of animals which had been immunized, contained an antibody (known at the time as an antitoxin), which could then be injected into humans to cure the disease. Development of the sulfonamides rendered immunization against scarlet fever unnecessary, but she continued to study other aspects of the disease. In 1941, she typed the streptococci of scarlet fever which was an important breakthrough for tracking the epidemiology of the disease. Fraser also conducted research in an attempt to develop an antigen for tuberculosis. With the development of penicillin, her research after 1947, shifted focus to the study of antibiotics including <b>bacitracin,</b> penicillin, polymixin, and subtilin. Fraser studied various preparations of penicillin against the tubercular bacillus and as a treatment for gonorrhoea. Rising through the ranks of assistant professor and associate professor, Fraser became a full professor in 1949 teaching preventative medicine for the Bachelor of Science or nursing degree for the remainder of her career. In 1955 Fraser was appointed as a professor of microbiology and held that post until her retirement a decade later.|$|E
25|$|H. larsenii is {{resistant}} to the following antibiotics: ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, neomycin, penicillin G, rifampicin, streptomycin, and tetracycline. The organism is sensitive to <b>bacitracin</b> and novobiocin. Antibiotic sensitivity and resistance was determined using the agar diffusion test in which paper discs saturated with antibiotics were placed on agar plates.|$|E
25|$|The {{role of the}} N-terminus is {{revealed}} by using a deletion mutation of the N-terminal plug; the protein {{was still able to}} be inserted into the membrane, but acts as a non-selective pore for larger molecules, exhibited by increased permeability of the cell to maltotetraose, maltopentaose, ferrichrome, as well as several antibiotics including albomycin, vancomycin and <b>bacitracin.</b> However, this has to be treated with caution, as the conformation of the barrel may change {{in the absence of the}} N-terminal plug.|$|E
25|$|Streptococcus dysgalactiae form large colonies (>0.5cm) after 24 {{hours of}} incubation, and produce haemolysis on blood agar; SDSD is alpha-haemolytic, whereas SDSE is {{predominantly}} beta-haemolytic. They are facultative anaerobic, incapable of respiratory metabolism, but are aerotolerant. Growth {{is enhanced by}} incubation in 5% CO2 atmosphere, but they usually grow adequately in ambient air. The optimum temperature for growth is approximately 37° Celsius. Lancefield group C and G carbohydrate antigens are predominantly expressed, but group A and L have been documented. However, the above characteristics are not unique to S.dysgalactiae, and further testing is required to confirm the species identity. Although many laboratories currently identify bacteria by mass-spectrometry (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/ionization Time Of Flight (MALDI TOF MS), phenotypic testing is still widely used. Unlike Streptococcus pyogenes (harbouring Lancefield group A antigen), S.dysgalactiae is PYR-negative and <b>Bacitracin</b> resistant. The distinction from the Streptococcus anginosus group (Lancefield A, C, G or F) {{can be made by}} colony size and Voges Proskauer test (VP); the S.anginosus group being VP positive. Streptococcus equi contains Lancefield group C, and Streptococcus canis harbours group G, but unlike S.dysgalactiae, they are both Hyaluronidase negative.|$|E
2500|$|The FDA is {{not trying}} to {{regulate}} all antimicrobials at this time - only those antibiotics which are considered “medically important.” [...] For example, <b>bacitracin,</b> a common antibiotic found in over the counter antibiotic ointments, is not classified as “medically important.” [...] Also, ionophores, which are not a part of human medicine but given for improving the health of livestock, are also not included in this regulation.|$|E
2500|$|Some SBVT {{members have}} {{questioned}} the propriety of Kerry's first Purple Heart, received for a wound sustained on December 2, 1968. Kerry remained on duty after being wounded, [...] and sought treatment at the following day's sick call. [...] They assert that the injury was too minor to merit a citation because the only treatment Kerry received, after the removal {{of a piece of}} shrapnel from his arm, was <b>bacitracin</b> (an antibiotic) and a bandage, and he returned to service immediately. Other division members, including at least one SBVT member, received Purple Hearts under similar circumstances. [...] SBVT also claims that the wound was not from enemy fire but was from shrapnel of a grenade he fired himself, ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{remarkable}} {{stability of}} cyclotides {{means that they}} have an exciting range of potential applications centred on either their intrinsic biological activities or the possibility of using the CCK motif as a scaffold for stabilizing biologically active epitopes. [...] Interest in these has recently intensified with the publications of a chemical methodology capable of synthetically producing cyclotides with high yields, and the amenability of the CCK framework to amino-acid substitutions. [...] But for molecules to be useful in a therapeutic setting they require useful biopharmaceutical characteristics such as resistance to proteolysis and membrane permeability. The membrane interactive surface area and moment of the cyclotides are determinants in the prediction of their biological activities. A recent study on related cystine knot proteins as drug candidates showed that cystine knots do permeate well through rat small intestinal mucosa relative to non-cystine knot peptide drugs such as insulin and <b>bacitracin.</b> Furthermore, enzymatic digestion of cystine knot peptide drugs was associated with only a few proteases and it was suggested that this limitation may be overcome by mutating out particular cleavage sites. Thus, certain cystine knot proteins satisfy the basic criteria for drug delivery and represent exciting novel candidates as scaffolds for peptide drug delivery. [...] The diverse range of intrinsic activities of cyclotides also continues to hold promise {{for a wide range of}} applications in the agricultural fields against insects and nematodes, especially those from Clitoria ternatea.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bacitracin</b> is {{composed}} of a mixture of related compounds {{with varying degrees of}} antibacterial activity. Notable fractions include <b>bacitracin</b> A, A1, B, B1, B2, C, D, E, F, G, and X. <b>Bacitracin</b> A has been found to have the most antibacterial activity. <b>Bacitracin</b> B1 and B2 have similar potencies and are approximately 90% as active as <b>bacitracin</b> A.

50|$|In infants, <b>bacitracin</b> {{is rarely}} {{administered}} intramuscularly {{for the treatment}} of staphylococcal pneumonia and empyema when due to organisms shown susceptible to <b>bacitracin.</b> This use is extremely limited, since <b>bacitracin</b> is nephrotoxic and the concentration of <b>bacitracin</b> in the blood must be followed closely.|$|E
