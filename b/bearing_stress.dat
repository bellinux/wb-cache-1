2500|$|The bearing {{capacity}} of soil {{is the average}} contact stress between a foundation and the soil which will cause shear failure in the soil. [...] Allowable <b>bearing</b> <b>stress</b> is the {{bearing capacity}} divided {{by a factor of}} safety. [...] Sometimes, on soft soil sites, large settlements may occur under loaded foundations without actual shear failure occurring; in such cases, the allowable <b>bearing</b> <b>stress</b> is determined with regard to the maximum allowable settlement. It is important during construction and design stage of a project to evaluate the subgrade strength. The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test is commonly used to determine the suitability of a soil as a subgrade for design and construction. The field Plate Load Test is commonly used to predict the deformations and failure characteristics of the soil/subgrade and modulus of subgrade reaction (ks). The Modulus of subgrade reaction (ks) is used in foundation design, soil-structure interaction studies and design of highway pavements.|$|E

As {{can be seen from}} figure (b), higher stresses can be observed at the vicinity of the hole. However, it is unreasonable to conclude the main load passes that area with stress concentration because the hole (which has no material) is not important for carrying the load. The stress concentration caused by the structural singularities like a hole or a notch makes the load transfer analysis more difficult.|$|E
30|$|When {{concrete}} slabs {{are subjected to}} loads, <b>bearing</b> <b>stresses</b> and deflection are mainly affected by the spacing of dowel bars. Decreased dowel bar spacing results in the reduction in <b>bearing</b> <b>stresses</b> and deflection. However, if dowel bar spacing decreases to less than 203  mm (8  in), a horizontal plane of weakness in the concrete slab at the joint face will occur. On the contrary, the increased dowel bar spacing leads to excessive <b>bearing</b> <b>stresses</b> and deflection at the joint. Currently, most highway agencies have adopted a 305  mm (12  in) spacing requirement, which also depends on the slab thickness and subgrade conditions.|$|R

50|$|Mechanical Concrete is economical. Costs {{are less}} by 25 to 50 percent {{compared}} with other road and wall construction methods {{for a variety of}} reasons. First, most reinforced concrete and masonry structures are inherently over-designed to resist the bearing-type stresses generated by the loads supported. Although Mechanical Concrete is over-designed, it operates much closer to the <b>bearing</b> <b>stress</b> range generated by the loads being supported so it is more economical. In addition, a Mechanical Concrete structure is manufactured at the construction site and ready to resist loads as soon as it is placed — no setting or curing time is required. To create and build these structures consumes less net energy than comparable construction methods.|$|E
50|$|Provided {{that the}} wheel load and {{configuration}} of the landing gear remain unchanged, the weight and volume of the tire will decrease {{with an increase in}} inflation pressure. From the flotation standpoint, a decrease in the tire contact area will induce a higher <b>bearing</b> <b>stress</b> on the pavement, thus eliminates certain airports from the aircraft’s operational bases. Braking will also become less effective due to a reduction in the frictional force between the tires and the ground. In addition, the decrease {{in the size of the}} tire, and hence the size of the wheel, could pose a problem if internal brakes are to be fitted inside the wheel rims. The arguments against higher pressure are of such a nature that commercial operators generally prefer the lower pressures in order to maximize tire life and minimize runway stress. To prevent punctures from stones Philippine Airlines had to operate their Hawker Siddeley 748 aircraft with pressures as low as the tire manufacturer would permit. However, too low a pressure can lead to an accident as in the Nigeria Airways Flight 2120.|$|E
50|$|Over time, {{the number}} of {{sprockets}} in a cogset has increased, from three or four before World War II, to five used from the 1950s to the 1970s, up to the eight, nine, ten, eleven, or twelve now found on modern bikes. As more rear sprockets were added, the combination became wider, and the sprocket spacing narrower. One {{of the ways to}} make space for this was the axle length (measured as the Over Locknut Distance — O.L.D.) was increased, necessitating more dish on the rear wheel drive side with a threaded hub to centre the wheel in the frame. The hub flanges spacing was not shortened on threaded hubs, rather the axle length increased from 120 mm O.L.D. (five-speed/compact six) to 126 mm O.L.D. (six-speed/compact seven) through to 130 mm O.L.D. (threaded seven-speed) for a road bike. MTB rear spacing is normally 135 mm O.L.D. Another advantage of the Shimano cassette hubs introduced from 1978 was that the rear hub flanges were wider apart than those of a threaded hub, so built a stronger wheel with less dish and without the problem of increased <b>bearing</b> <b>stress</b> or axle failure.|$|E

The aim is to outline the complex interrelation of all fundamentals with the rolling contact fatigue and the attainable bearing life. Such fundamentals include, amongst others, <b>bearing</b> <b>stressing</b> and life capability. The article shows {{the different types of}} rolling <b>bearing</b> <b>stressing</b> and the analysis of the stress distribution (principal stresses and equivalent stresses) in the material under the rolling contact area. It becomes obvious that the contamination of the bearing with foreign particles leads to a drastic reduction in bearing life. Furthermore, it demonstrates the impact of the bearing lubrication and coating as well as the effect of additives on the attainable life and wear. Further fundamentals of rolling element bearing design are the materials, the material cleanliness and the heat treatment. The article reveals the importance of the cleanliness of bearing steels as well as different types of inclusions and their effect on rolling contact fatigue. Additionally the article describes how to optimize the material properties (strength, toughness and residual stress) by the heat treatment processes. The outcome of these investigations is that endurance life of a rolling element bearing can be achieved if specific operating conditions, an adequate lubrication, good system cleanliness and specific <b>bearing</b> <b>stressing</b> are met.

40|$|To {{design a}} bolted joint, the {{transition}} <b>bearing</b> <b>stress</b> and maximumbearing stress {{have to be}} regarded. Transition <b>bearing</b> <b>stress</b> is thebearing stress where bearing failure begins and maximum bearing stressis where the joint goes to total failure. A method for studying rotationin a bolted joint has been developed using an optical instrument calledDigital Speckle Photography, DSP, which is a non-contact extensometerusing digital cameras, together with a load frame. The data from DSPsystem is transformed and analyzed to get rotations for different partsof the joint. Thinner joints give higher values on transition bearingstress, higher maximum <b>bearing</b> <b>stress</b> and higher maximum bolt rotation,than thicker joints. Bolt torque has a big impact and higher torquegives the same positive results as thinner joints. Increased secondarybending makes the joint more resistant to bearing failure, whichincreases the transition bearing failure stress, maximum bearing failurestress and maximum bolt rotation. There is a relationship between thecurve slope in a <b>bearing</b> <b>stress</b> versus bolt rotation figure and thetransition <b>bearing</b> <b>stress.</b> If the joint has a lower value on boltrotation, in comparison with other joints, at the same bearing stress,this {{will lead to a}} higher transition <b>bearing</b> <b>stress...</b>|$|E

40|$|Joints {{are always}} a concern in the {{construction}} and long-term performance of concrete pavements. Research has shown that we need some type of positive load transfer across transverse joints. The same research has directed pavement designers to use round dowels spaced at regular intervals across the transverse joint to distribute the vehicle loads both longitudinally and transversely across the joint. The goal is to reduce <b>bearing</b> <b>stresses</b> on the dowels and the two pavement slab edges and erosion of the underlying surface, hence improved long-term joint and pavement structure performance. Road salts cause metal corrosion in doweled joints, excessive <b>bearing</b> <b>stresses</b> hollow dowel ends, and construction processes are associated with cracking pavement {{at the end of}} dowels. Dowels are also a cost factor in the pavement costs when joint spacing is reduced to control curling and warping distress in pavements.

40|$|Concrete {{structural}} {{elements such as}} wall sections, bridge abutments and slabs on grade rely on dowels to transfer loads across the joints. As the joint width becomes wider, or if the joint is formed, the effect of aggregate interlock to transfer load is reduced and the loads are transferred by dowels. The dowels can be circular or elliptical shaped and are more commonly made of steel or Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP). This research project considered steel dowels with either a circular or an elliptical shape used in a highway or airport pavement. The following linear-elastic analysis, however, {{can be used for}} FRP dowels and for other doweled {{structural elements}}. Dowels are spaced along transverse joints in a highway or airport pavement. The dowel 2 ̆ 7 s main purpose is to transfer shear load across the joint which separates adjacent concrete slabs. Dowels are approximately eighteen inches (457 mm) long, placed at mid-height of the pavement thickness, positioned parallel to the pavement surface, and embedded symmetrically about the transverse joint centerline. The transverse joint was assumed to open, and its width is dependent on the combination of concrete shrinkage and slab contraction due to colder temperatures. Wheel loads from a single axle, positioned along the open transverse joint, apply a shear load to each effective dowel along the joint. Effective dowels are those dowels included in the distribution of the wheel loads. The shear load causes the dowels to bear against the concrete and causes the dowels to deflect within the concrete. These deflections are directly related to the <b>bearing</b> <b>stress</b> between the embedded dowel and the concrete (or contact <b>bearing</b> <b>stress).</b> The maximum <b>bearing</b> <b>stress</b> corresponds to the maximum deflection which occurs at the transverse joint face. If the maximum <b>bearing</b> <b>stress</b> does not exceed some portion of the elastic-limit stress for concrete, the deformed concrete around the deflected dowel will rebound to its original or reference state. Repetitive loading, however, may not allow the deformed concrete around the dowel to rebound to its original state before another set of wheel loads crosses the transverse joint. In this repetitive load case, permanent concrete deformation would be present. A need exists to reduce the <b>bearing</b> <b>stress</b> around dowels for maximum axle loading, as well as, repetitive axle loading. Therefore, a comparison was made between circular- and elliptical-shaped dowels with equivalent flexural rigidity. This dowel comparison showed that, for a given load, the elliptical shape with a wider cross section had reduced deflections within the concrete and, reduced <b>bearing</b> <b>stress</b> between the dowel and the concrete. Also, the deflections of the dowel within the concrete at the transverse joint face, for the circular and elliptical shapes, compare favorably with measured deflections found through experimental methods. Two published analytical foundation models for a beam on elastic foundation were used to determine the deflections of the embedded dowel within the concrete. The first foundation model {{is referred to as the}} one-parameter (or Winkler) model, and the second foundation model is referred to as the two-parameter model. The deflections along the dowel were found using each model 2 ̆ 7 s respective assumed displaced shape (general solution to the differential equation). The first model 2 ̆ 7 s general solution, based on the embedded length of the dowel, was divided into separate theories used for analyzing the dowel. The second model 2 ̆ 7 s general solution was simplified due to a slight modification. The contribution of this research project was to simplify beam on elastic foundation theory through matrix formulation and apply these improved analysis methods to dowels embedded in concrete pavements joints. One of these simplifications allows for the analysis of any dowel embedment length greater than about nine inches (229 mm). Dividing the dowel into smaller elements is not required in the solution. The analytical foundation models represented the concrete with linear-elastic springs. The spring stiffness for each model is given by elastic constants or parameters. Each model predicts slightly different deflection behavior for the embedded dowel based on these parameters. The first model assumes the springs act independently to support the dowel; whereas, the second model assumes interaction between adjacent springs. Modifications were made to the first model to include the effect of pavement thickness which allowed for comparison of both models. The theoretical <b>bearing</b> <b>stress</b> between the dowel and the concrete was determined based on the fourth derivative of the assumed displaced shape for a particular model. Therefore, the bearing stresses along the dowel-concrete interface are directly related to the corresponding deflections along the dowel within the concrete. The maximum theoretical <b>bearing</b> <b>stress</b> at the transverse joint face was compared to experimental <b>bearing</b> <b>stress.</b> The experimental <b>bearing</b> <b>stress</b> was calculated from the measured deflection of the dowel at the transverse joint face. The maximum <b>bearing</b> <b>stress</b> was limited to some portion of the elastic-limit stress for the concrete medium. For a given concrete depth below the dowel, as the load on the dowel is increased, the deflections along the dowel within the concrete and the bearing stresses along the dowel-concrete interface will increase. The analyses using the foundation models (described previously) showed, however, that as the medium depth below the dowel was reduced the dowel deflections within the concrete decreased. A decrease in deflection could be explained by the reduction in cumulative compression over the smaller depth. In addition, the analyses by these models showed that as the concrete medium depth below the dowel decreased the contact <b>bearing</b> <b>stress</b> increased. To verify the deflection behavior of dowels embedded in concrete, experimental testing was undertaken for various size steel dowels having either a circular or an elliptical shape. Three laboratory test methods were modeled using the stiffness method of structural analysis. Two elemental shear test methods and a cantilever test method were modeled. The elemental shear test methods investigated a single dowel that was embedded in concrete on either side of an open transverse joint and subjected to shear loading. The models, based on the assembled stiffness matrix, were used to determine the deflections along the dowel within the concrete and to verify elastic constants for a particular foundation model. Additional analysis of the elemental shear test specimens allowed for the inclusion of an elastic medium under a portion of the test specimen to model soil-pavement interaction. This analysis was referred to as the three-parameter model which defines a layered system. In this system, the embedded dowel and surrounding concrete are idealized as beams, connected together with springs and the concrete beam is further supported by an elastic medium...|$|E

A new type of Double-Tapered Round (DTR) dowels is proposed, {{and the performance of}} DTR dowels is compared to that of traditional cylindrical dowels. Linear Elastic (LE) analysis are performed in Abaqus (v- 6. 11) order to identify the optimized geometry of DTR dowels that would achieve (1) highest load transfer across adjacent slabs through shear action, and (2) lowest <b>bearing</b> <b>stresses</b> on the concrete. LE analyses are complemented by nonlinear FE analysis. The Riks method available in Abaqus/Standard, coupled with the Concrete Damaged Plasticity (CDP) model is used to simulate the degradation of concrete surrounding both DTR the traditional cylindrical dowels.

While adequate load-transfer is a crucial part for the proper performance pavement structures, the load-transfer capacity of DTR dowels was more effective over cylindrical dowels by as far as 116 %. In the inelastic range, even after significant concrete degradation and steel yielding, DTR dowels maintained a higher load-transfer capacity than traditional cylindrical dowels, and also presented lower amounts of differential deflections across concrete floors.

Thermal and structural analyses of the leading edge assembly were carried out using ABAQUS finite element software. Final results showed that the proposed modifications aided in thermally isolating hot and cold subcomponents and reducing <b>bearing</b> <b>stresses</b> at the attachment location...|$|R
