These strategies range from 'level scheduling' (i. e. lean production) right through to 'pure chase' (i. e. agile manufacture) with appropriate simple algorithmic control support via APIOBPCS software. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Background: Breastfeeding has {{protective}} effects {{for the development}} of allergies and atopy. Recent evidence underlines that consumption of unboiled farm milk in early life is a key factor preventing the development of atopic diseases. Farm milk intake has been associated with increased demethylation of FOXP 3 and increased numbers of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Thus, the questions arose which components of farm milk control the differentiation and function of Tregs, critical T cell subsets that promote tolerance induction and inhibit the development of allergy and autoimmunity. Findings: Based on translational research we identified at least six major signalling pathways that could explain milk's biological role controlling stable FoxP 3 expression and Treg differentiation: (1) via maintaining appropriate magnitudes of Akt-mTORC 1 signalling, (2) <b>via</b> <b>transfer</b> of milk fat-derived long-chain ω- 3 fatty acids, (3) <b>via</b> <b>transfer</b> of milk-derived exosomal microRNAs that apparently decrease FOXP 3 promoter methylation, (4) <b>via</b> <b>transfer</b> of exosomal transforming growth factor-β, which induces SMAD 2 /SMAD 3 -dependent FoxP 3 expression, (5) via milk-derived Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species that induce interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) -mediated differentiation of Tregs, and (6) via milk-derived oligosaccharides that serve as selected nutrients for the growth of bifidobacteria in the intestine of the new born infant. Conclusion: Accumulating evidence underlines that milk is a complex signalling and epigenetic imprinting network that promotes stable FoxP 3 expression and long-lasting Treg differentiation, crucial postnatal events preventing atopic and autoimmune diseases...|$|R
