5|$|A {{thallium}} atom has 81 electrons, {{arranged in}} the electron configuration 4f145d106s26p1; of these, the three outermost electrons {{in the sixth}} shell are valence electrons.

40|$|Many {{official}} {{groups have}} endorsed the wider use by emerging market borrowers of contract clauses which {{allow for a}} qualified majority of bondholders to restructure repayment terms {{in the event of}} financial distress. Some have argued that such clauses will be associated with moral hazard and increased borrowing costs. This paper addresses this question empirically using primary and secondary market yields and finds no evidence that the presence of collective action clauses increases yields for either higher- or lower-rated issuers.

The savings glut hypothesis (including difficult-to-track petrodollar recycling) and U.

5|$|From left {{to right}} across the {{standard}} form of periodic table, as metallic character decreases, nonmetals therefore adopt structures that show a gradual reduction {{in the numbers of}} nearest neighbours—three or two for the polyatomic nonmetals, through one for the diatomic nonmetals, to zero for the monatomic noble gases. A similar pattern occurs more generally, {{at the level of the}} entire periodic table, in comparing metals and nonmetals. There is a transition from metallic <b>bonding</b> among the metals on the left of the table through to covalent or Van der Waals (electrostatic) <b>bonding</b> among the nonmetals on the right of the table. Metallic <b>bonding</b> tends to involve close-packed centrosymmetric structures with a high number of nearest neighbours. Post-transition metals and metalloids, sandwiched between the true metals and the nonmetals, tend to have more complex structures with an intermediate number of nearest neighbours. Nonmetallic <b>bonding,</b> towards the right of the table, features open-packed directional (or disordered) structures with fewer or zero nearest neighbours. As noted, this steady reduction in the number of nearest neighbours, as metallic character decreases and nonmetallic character increases, is mirrored among the nonmetals, the structures of which gradually change from polyatomic, to diatomic, to monatomic.|$|E

50|$|Usually, {{a single}} <b>bond</b> is a sigma <b>bond.</b> An {{exception}} is the <b>bond</b> in diboron, which is a pi <b>bond.</b> In contrast, the double <b>bond</b> consists of one sigma <b>bond</b> and one pi <b>bond,</b> and a triple <b>bond</b> consists of one sigma <b>bond</b> and two pi <b>bonds</b> (Moore, Stanitski, and Jurs 396). The number of component <b>bonds</b> is what determines the strength disparity. It {{stands to reason that}} the single <b>bond</b> is the weakest of the three because it consists of only a sigma <b>bond,</b> and the double <b>bond</b> or triple <b>bond</b> consist not only of this type of component <b>bond</b> but also at least one additional <b>bond.</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{determinants}} of corporate <b>bond</b> spreads in emerging markets economies. Using a largely unexploited dataset, the paper finds that corporate <b>bond</b> spreads are determined by firm-specific variables, <b>bond</b> characteristics, macroeconomic conditions, sovereign risk, and global factors. A variance decomposition analysis shows that firm-level characteristics account for the {{larger share of the}} variance. In addition, the paper finds two asymmetries. The first is in line with the sovereign ceiling "lite" hypothesis which states that the transfer of risk from the sovereign to the private sector is less than 1 to 1. The second is consistent with the popular notion that panics are common in emerging markets where investors are less informed and more prone to herding.

40|$|This paper {{sets forth}} some basic {{principles}} {{that could help}} debt managers in emerging market and other countries to plan and implement sovereign debt buyback and swap operations. It discusses the macroeconomic context in which buybacks and swaps are undertaken, the objectives of buybacks and swaps, the analytical framework for deciding whether to undertake a particular buyback or swap operation and for selecting among alternative operations, and some key issues in {{the determination of the}} strategy for executing buybacks and swaps. The focus is on developing the analytical framework for evaluating sovereign debt buyback and swap operations, since very little work has been done in this area. In this regard, the paper presents a step-wise decision-making procedure, in which discounted cash flow analysis and the use of strategic benchmarks for the debt play central roles.

5|$|The {{alkali metals}} form {{complete}} series of compounds with all usually encountered anions, which well illustrate group trends. These compounds {{can be described}} as involving the alkali metals losing electrons to acceptor species and forming monopositive ions. This description is most accurate for alkali halides and becomes less and less accurate as cationic and anionic charge increase, and as the anion becomes larger and more polarisable.

5|$|The closed-shell {{electron}} configuration of flerovium {{results in the}} metallic <b>bonding</b> in metallic flerovium being weaker than in the preceding and following elements; thus, flerovium {{is expected to have}} a low boiling point, and has recently been suggested to be possibly a gaseous metal, similar to the predictions for copernicium, which also has a closed-shell {{electron configuration}}. The melting and boiling points of flerovium were predicted in the 1970s to be around 70°C and 150°C, significantly lower than the values for the lighter group 14 elements (those of lead are 327°C and 1749°C respectively), and continuing the trend of decreasing boiling points down the group. Although earlier studies predicted a boiling point of ~1000°C or 2840°C, this is now considered unlikely because of the expected weak metallic <b>bonding</b> in flerovium and that group trends would expect flerovium to have a low sublimation enthalpy. Recent experimental indications have suggested that the pseudo-closed shell configuration of flerovium results in very weak metallic <b>bonding</b> and hence that flerovium is probably a gas at room temperature with a boiling point of around −60°C.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{makes an}} {{assessment}} of the progress made in developing local debt markets in emerging Asia. Market development has been limited by hurdles confronting borrowers and lenders, current and potential liquidity providers, and insufficient support from government policies and regulations. Besides fostering a credit culture to deepen local debt markets, the issue of critical size can be addressed through an integrated regional market for local currency <b>bonds</b> that provides greater scale, efficiency, and access. With rapid economic growth in Asia, a key challenge is to generate financial assets that can provide the underlying collateral for expanding fixed-income markets, and hence domestic and regional investment opportunities.
