These mirrors are everlasting; for centuries they have kept showing us our nakedness in its clearest form which we very often do not want to admit but ignore. One such mirror was created by the Italian poet Dante Alighieri back in the 14 th century called the Divine Comedy comprising three parts: Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso. This paper takes up the first part: the Inferno. Using Reader-Response Criticism, this paper revisits and brings back the Seven Deadly Sins as stated in Catechism of the Catholic Church (1995) : superbia, avaritia, invidia, ira, luxuria, gula, acedia which are the main religious topics in the Inferno to indicate their significance in contemporary Indonesia. Although Reader-Response Criticism is a collective term, the critical theories that come under it agree that it is the readers who create the meaning of the text. In other words, it is the individual reader who produces the meaning of the text; it has its existence {{in the mind of the}} reader and therefore there is no one fixed correct meaning of a text.
