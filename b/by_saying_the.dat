5|$|After hearing {{news that}} Syed {{is trying to}} find his wife Amira Shah (Preeya Kalidas), Yusef visits her father, Qadim (Ramon Tikaram) at his office and offers to avenge his family for causing Amira pain. When Zainab and Yusef attend an event together, people assume they are married and Zainab does not correct them. Afterwards, Yusef admits to Zainab that he has great {{feelings}} for her but they should maintain some distance as she is married. Yusef continues to manipulate Zainab and ply her with pills, but she says she wishes to stop taking them, so Yusef crushes up a bottle of pills and conceals them in Zainab's food. Zainab passes out and is hospitalised, with her family believing she took a deliberate overdose, as was Yusef's plan. Concerned that he himself is causing Zainab's worries, Masood divorces Zainab <b>by</b> <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> triple talaq.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{attacked}} {{not only}} hereditary privilege, {{but also the}} rhetoric that Burke used to defend it. Most of Burke's detractors deplored what they viewed as his theatrical pity for Marie Antoinette, but Wollstonecraft was unique in her love of Burke's gendered language. <b>By</b> <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> sublime and the beautiful, terms first established by Burke himself in A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1756), she kept his rhetoric {{as well as his}} argument. In her first unabashedly feminist critique, which Wollstonecraft scholar Claudia Johnson describes as unsurpassed in its argumentative force, Wollstonecraft indicts Burke's justification of an equal society founded on the passivity of women.|$|E

The US government responded <b>by</b> <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> Rhodesian mission and its staff had no official diplomatic status and violated no US laws.|$|E

Peter's sister Lucy (Melissa Suffield) takes a big liking to Leon and holds a party in 89b George Street so she can spend time with him. The party turns to chaos and Lucy and Leon get {{everyone}} out <b>by</b> <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> police are outside. Leon offers to help Lucy clean up and asks her to join {{in a game of}} Twister with him. As they are playing, a condom falls out Lucy's pocket. Leon sees it and says {{he did not want to}} take advantage of her. However, she kisses him passionately, which leads to sex. After they have sex, Leon receives a text message and gets dressed but asks if Lucy wants to do it again. Lucy says yes, but after appears disturbed.|$|E
25|$|Prior to January 1972, {{if someone}} asked Genie a {{question}} using the interrogative word where she invariably responded <b>by</b> <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> last {{word of the}} speaker's sentence. In early January 1972 she began to give accurate, grammatical responses to where questions in conversations. By February 1972, in everyday interactions Genie clearly understood and appropriately acted on most questions using the interrogative words who, what, where, when, why, which, and how. Unlike most children, who grasp who, what, which, and where questions much earlier than when, how, or why questions, {{the only one of}} these which took longer for Genie understand was why and even this took much less time than linguists expected. Because the latter group of questions require more cognitive sophistication to properly answer, the scientists offered this as additional proof that Genie had a higher level of cognitive functioning than most children in similar phases of language acquisition.|$|E

25|$|Kawauchi {{improved}} his half marathon best to 1:02:40 at the Kagawa Marugame Half Marathon in February 2011, finishing inside the top ten. He {{set his sights}} on a top eight finish at the Tokyo Marathon later that month but exceeded his own expectations by running a time of 2:08:37 hours and taking third place. As the best Japanese performer, he earned selection for the 2011 World Championships in Athletics. In June he entered the Okinoshima Ultramarathon and led the 50km race right up to the last 600 metres, at which point he collapsed due to heat stroke and failed to finish the race. At the World Championship Marathon held in Daegu he finished in 18th place – a performance which helped the Japanese team including Hiroyuki Horibata and Kentaro Nakamoto to a silver medal in the 2011 World Marathon Cup. He competed extensively {{towards the end of the}} year and his form held well: he managed fourth at the Osaka Marathon, then took third at the Fukuoka Marathon. The latter was an Olympic qualifying race and he was the first placed Japanese. The Japan Association of Athletics Federations played down his selection choices, saying his time of 2:09:57 was not fast enough, but Kawauchi upturned tradition <b>by</b> <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> race was a warm-up for the second qualifier in Tokyo – Japanese runners rarely enter both selection races due to their proximity in the running calendar. Only two weeks later Kawauchi entered the Hofu Marathon and was runner-up behind Mongolia's Serod Bat-Ochir. He remarked that the fatigue from the previous race had hurt his chances of winning the race.|$|E

500|$|Chapter VI begins <b>by</b> <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> {{next three}} {{chapters}} will address possible {{objections to the}} theory, the first being that often no intermediate forms between closely related species are found, though the theory implies such forms must have existed. As Darwin noted, [...] "Firstly, why, if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms? [...] Why is not all nature in confusion, instead of the species being, as we see them, well defined?" [...] Darwin attributed this to the competition between different forms, combined with {{the small number of}} individuals of intermediate forms, often leading to extinction of such forms. This difficulty can be referred to as the absence or rarity of transitional varieties in habitat space.|$|E
