Plasma sterilization, an atoxic low-temperature substitute for conventional sterilization, uses various gases that are activated by an electrical discharge, generating reactive species that promote lethality in microorganisms.

In this study MT excretion, serum MT, and serum creatinine concentrations were significantly higher in subjects with abnormal renal function who had been exposed to Cd. MT excretion was also linearly related on an individual basis to protein excretion, beta 2 -microglobulin (beta 2 -M) excretion, and cumulative time weighted exposure (dose). MT excretion was also a better predictor of dose than either beta 2 -M excretion or Cd excretion. The findings suggest that MT is a potential <b>biological</b> <b>monitor</b> for chronic Cd exposure that would be useful for preventing Cd-induced nephropathy.

Toxicity of heavy metals {{has never been in}} dispute and therefore their presence in our natural environment is undesirable. This study was undertaken to establish the capability of Perna viridis as a monitor for pollution in the Manora channel. Accumulation of Zinc, Copper, Iron and Manganese by marine mussels, sampled from Manora channel, was determined. Metal load varied markedly between individuals from the same populatin. This variability was partly accounted for systematic relationship between metal load and body weight and age. The distribution of metal between the major organs was considered, but the analysis of separate organs showed no advantage for their use as a <b>biological</b> <b>monitor.</b> comparison between Iron, Manganese, Copper and Zinc concentration in ambient sea water and in the mussel showed no clear correspondence.

Contaminants and their effects on fish as well as on other marine organisms belong to the main topics of international monitoring schemes. Biomarkers, as the measures of biological effects, have to meet essential requirements to be recommended on an international level. Among the prerequisites are assessment criteria to describe the main thresholds: to background contamination on one hand and to unacceptable effects and harm to the organism on the other hand. This article describes strategies and drawbacks of choosing and applying marker of contaminant effects to marine field samples. It reflects the actual stage of international guidelines for <b>biological</b> effects <b>monitoring</b> in marine fish and provides an outlook on future use of biomarker as part of an integrated assessments of the marine ecosystem.

Particulate matter is regulated by Mexican norms, but its chemical composition is not. Plants were transplanted from a clean environment to four sites at the TVA corridor, and exposed for 12 weeks from February to April 2008. Trace element accumulation of plants was determined by Particle induced X ray Emission PIXE and Neutron Activa-tion Analysis (NAA). Results reveal differences in trace elements distribution among sites in the TVA corridor. Furthermore, anthropogenic elements (S, V) and crustal elements (Ca) in T. usneoides exhibit high levels. Highly toxic elements such as Hg, As and Cr although present at trace levels, showed un enrichment relative to the initial values, when transplanted to the TVA corridor.
