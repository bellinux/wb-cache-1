50|$|In the {{original}} series the course consisted of padded hurdles of varying heights, a rope climb, monkey bars (a hand bike for male challengers during Season 2-3), running across spinning logs, climbing up a cargo net, going down a flying fox, walking across a <b>balancing</b> <b>beam,</b> running up a travelator {{which is going}} in the opposite direction, then after that, the first challenger to swing on a tarzan rope through the crate paper banner {{at the finish line}} is the winner of the episode.|$|E
50|$|Reward Challenge: Out of {{the four}} {{competing}} castaways in each tribe, one is selected to pull a rope connected to spinning platform. With a tribemate on top, they must maintain their balance until they have been unwind by the rope. There is a number for an equation hidden by the rope that they must remember, before they continue. Then, they must unwind the next spinning platform. Repeating the process. First runner must {{head back to the}} fourth spinning platform, and wait until they are unwind. A <b>balancing</b> <b>beam</b> then awaits them, with mathematical symbols and a number in order on the beam that they must remember. The other side of the course is a puzzle platform where one person in the tribe must assemble the numbers in the right order and the mathematical signs to make the correct equation. First tribe to make the correct equation wins.|$|E

40|$|A ball <b>balancing</b> <b>beam</b> is a {{nonlinear}} {{dynamic system}} {{which is quite}} di#cult to control using conventional methods since some special mathematical techniques and control theory knowledge are required to derive the equations. There are di#cult issues in this system: it has delayed feedback associated with control actions; and the #jumping ball" phenomenon brings sensor uncertainty. Balancing is essential in carrying out robotic tasks such as transporting objects in robotic arms and walking of legged robots. Fuzzy logic will be implemented to balance this nonlinear dynamic system. Relative to conventional controllers, a fuzzy logic controller requires less mathematical derivation in design; it has high noise tolerance, probably gravity independence, and it is portable to other scales of same system setup such as with a shorter beam or a heavier ball. In this paper, membership function construction, and fuzzy rule generation are discussed in detail. The hardware setup is shown. In addition, ways to overcome feedback delays and noisy signals are presented. Finally, {{the performance of the}} fuzzy controller will be evaluated and compared to conventional and neural network controllers.

40|$|Nonlinear dynamic ball <b>balancing</b> <b>beam</b> {{has been}} {{successfully}} controlled by applying conventional methods, neural networks, and fuzzy logic respectively. Conventional methods necessitate strong mathematical and control background to derive equations. Neural networks learn to balance a ball, but the ball never settles down {{due to the fact}} that "discrete resolution of the boxes representation" was used. Fuzzy logic has continuous representation; however, it takes a lot of efforts to incorporate human knowledge into rules. In order to have a continuous representation learning system with less rules and mathematics, a system with blend of neural networks and fuzzy logic is proposed. Fuzzy logic membership functions are utilized to fuzzify input parameters; neural network interpolates the fuzzy rule set; after defuzzification, the output is used to train a smaller size of neural network; the weights of the later neural network can be adjusted to #ne tune the controller. This controller balances balls with one third of the required 27 rules. With learning capability, it approaches its goal more frequently in general. In this paper, the design of the fuzzy-neural controller is discussed, the hardware setup is shown, and the performance is evaluated...|$|E
