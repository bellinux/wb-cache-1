5|$|During Easter in 1563, some {{priests in}} Ayrshire celebrated Mass, thus defying the law. Some Protestants tried {{to enforce the}} law {{themselves}} by apprehending these priests. This prompted Mary to summon Knox for the third time. She asked Knox to use his influence to promote religious toleration. He defended their actions and noted she was bound to uphold the laws and if she did not, others would. Mary surprised Knox by agreeing that the priests would <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>justice.</b>|$|E
5|$|The senate {{attempted}} to use Caligula's death {{as an opportunity}} to restore the republic. Chaerea tried to persuade the military to support the senate. The military, though, remained loyal to the idea of imperial monarchy. The grieving Roman people assembled and demanded that Caligula's murderers <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>justice.</b> Uncomfortable with lingering imperial support, the assassins sought out and stabbed Caligula's wife, Caesonia, and killed their young daughter, Julia Drusilla, by smashing her head against a wall. They were unable to reach Caligula's uncle, Claudius; after a soldier, Gratus, found Claudius hiding behind a palace curtain he was spirited out of the city by a sympathetic faction of the Praetorian Guard to the nearby Praetorian camp.|$|E

During the nearly year-long Leftist Riots, Kan held a hard line towards the rioters. He made a keynote speech in the Legislative Council, insisting those bombers <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>justice.</b> He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1967 Queen's Birthday Honours.|$|E

25|$|Many {{years after}} the {{marriage}} of Oedipus and Jocasta, a plague of infertility struck the city of Thebes, affecting crops, livestock and the people. Oedipus asserted that he would end the pestilence. He sent his uncle, Creon, to the Oracle at Delphi, seeking guidance. When Creon returned, Oedipus learned that the murderer of the former King Laius must <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>justice,</b> and Oedipus himself cursed the killer of his wife's late husband, saying {{that he would be}} exiled. Creon also suggested that they try to find the blind prophet, Tiresias who was widely respected. Oedipus sent for Tiresias, who warned him not to seek Laius' killer. In a heated exchange, Tiresias was provoked into exposing Oedipus himself as the killer, and the fact that Oedipus was living in shame because he did not know who his true parents were. Oedipus angrily blamed Creon for the false accusations, and the two argued. Jocasta entered and tried to calm Oedipus by telling him the story of her first-born son and his supposed death. Oedipus became nervous as he realized that he may have murdered Laius and so brought about the plague. Suddenly, a messenger arrived from Corinth with the news that King Polybus had died. Oedipus was relieved for the prophecy could no longer be fulfilled if Polybus, whom he considered his birth father, was now dead.|$|E

500|$|In {{suppressing the}} revolution, Batista's {{government}} had killed thousands of Cubans; Castro and influential {{sectors of the}} press put the death toll at 20,000, but a list of victims published shortly after the revolution contained only 898 names—over half of them combatants. More recent estimates place the death toll between 1000 and 4000. In response to popular uproar, which demanded that those responsible <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>justice,</b> Castro helped set up many trials, resulting in hundreds of executions. Although widely popular domestically, critics–in particular the U.S. press–argued that many were not fair trials.

500|$|In {{suppressing the}} revolution, Batista's {{government}} had orchestrated mass human rights abuses, with most {{estimates for the}} death toll typically placing it at around 20,000.

Although widely popular domestically, critics [...] in particular from the U.S. press [...] argued that many were not fair trials, and condemned Cuba's government as being more interested in vengeance than justice. In response, Castro proclaimed that [...] "revolutionary justice {{is not based on}} legal precepts, but on moral conviction", organizing the first Havana trial to take place before a mass audience of 17,000 at the Sports Palace stadium. He also intervened in other trials to ensure that what he saw as [...] "revolutionary justice" [...] was carried out; when a group of aviators accused of bombing a village were found not guilty at a trial in Santiago de Cuba, Castro ordered a retrial in which they were found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E
