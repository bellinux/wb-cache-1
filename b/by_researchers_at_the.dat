5|$|A study <b>by</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) {{found that}} growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could {{increase}} farmers incomes by US$40 per hectare per crop {{because it can}} provide food, feed and fuel.

5|$|The 2001 study <b>by</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Scripps Institution of Oceanography {{concluded}} that the imbalance between global dimming and global warming at the surface leads to weaker turbulent heat fluxes to the atmosphere.

5|$|In {{addition}} to immediate health effects, some injuries sustained during a player's career can have effects that extend to their post-career life. A cohort mortality study <b>by</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) examined 3,349 NFL players {{who played at}} least five full seasons from 1959 to 1988. The {{findings from this study}} suggest that, in comparison to the typical American male, NFL players live longer on average but have around three times the risk of death associated with neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, the risk of death from Alzheimer's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was roughly four times higher among former players than the average American male. The study also compared mortality risks from speed players (quarterbacks, running backs, fullbacks, wide receivers, tight ends, linebackers, cornerbacks, and safeties) and nonspeed players (offensive and defensive linemen), with findings indicating that a greater number of deaths were attributable to neurodegenerative disorders in speed players than nonspeed players. This {{may be due to the}} increased momentum of collisions from speed players.|$|E

25|$|Bacon is {{considered}} by many doctors to be unhealthy if eaten in excess. A study conducted <b>by</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Zurich found a connection between eating processed meat and the risk of dying from heart disease or cancer. Processed meats contain preservatives known as nitrates that, when absorbed by the human body, convert into nitrosamine, a chemical compound that could cause cancer. A second study by researchers at Columbia University found that the consumption of cured meats increase a person's chances of developing chronic pulmonary disease.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, a German medical researcher, Henning Allmers, {{published}} {{an article in the}} British medical journal The Lancet, suggesting it was likely that brain damage from the head wound Richthofen suffered in July 1917 (see above) played a part in the Red Baron's death. This was supported by a 2004 paper <b>by</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Texas. Richthofen's behaviour after his injury was noted as consistent with brain-injured patients, and such an injury could account for his perceived lack of judgement on his final flight: flying too low over enemy territory and suffering target fixation.|$|E
25|$|Following the Mars flyby of the Mariner 4 {{spacecraft}} in 1966, scientists {{concluded that}} Mars' polar caps consist entirely of dry ice. However, findings made in 2003 <b>by</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> California Institute of Technology {{have shown that}} Mars' polar caps are almost completely made of water ice, and that dry ice only forms a thin surface layer that thickens and thins seasonally. A phenomenon named dry ice storms was proposed to occur over the polar regions of Mars. They are comparable to Earth's thunderstorms, with crystalline CO2 taking the place {{of water in the}} clouds.|$|E

25|$|Work begun <b>by</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Tennessee in the 1970s into {{immunity}} against zonae pellucidae {{resulted in}} its identification {{as a target}} antigen for immunocontraception. The zona pellucida's suitability {{is a result of}} it being necessary for fertilization and containing at least one antigen that is tissue-specific and not species-specific. The tissue-specificity implies that immunity against zonae pellucidae will not also affect other tissues in the immunized animal's body. The lack of species-specificity implies that zonae pellucidae harvested from animals of one species will induce an immune response in those of another, which makes zona pellucida antigens readily available, since zonae pellucidae can be harvested from farm animals.|$|E
25|$|The {{dynamical}} Casimir {{effect is}} {{the production of}} particles and energy from an accelerated moving mirror. This reaction was predicted by certain numerical solutions to quantum mechanics equations made in the 1970s. In May 2011 an announcement was made <b>by</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Chalmers University of Technology, in Gothenburg, Sweden, of the detection of the dynamical Casimir effect. In their experiment, microwave photons were generated out of the vacuum in a superconducting microwave resonator. These researchers used a modified SQUID to change the effective length of the resonator in time, mimicking a mirror moving at the required relativistic velocity. If confirmed {{this would be the}} first experimental verification of the dynamical Casimir effect.|$|E
