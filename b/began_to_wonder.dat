5|$|As {{the power}} and {{reputation}} of Pietro II grew, the Venetian people <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> if he was secretly planning to establish a hereditary monarchy. Their fears were confirmed when his son, Otto Orseolo (named after Otto III), assumed the title of Doge upon Pietro II's death in 1009, thereby becoming the youngest Doge in Venetian history {{at the age of}} 16. Scandal marked much of Otto's reign as he showed a clear inclination toward nepotism by elevating several relatives to positions of power. In 1026, he was deposed by his enemies and exiled to Constantinople, but his successor, Pietro Barbolano, had such difficulty in attempting to unite the city that it seemed infighting would once again seize Venice.|$|E
5|$|During the Enlightenment and its {{debates about}} human origins, it became fashionable to {{speculate}} {{about the origin of}} language. Thinkers such as Rousseau and Herder argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as Kant and Descartes held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world– asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led {{to the question of whether}} philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the linguistic turn and philosophers such as Wittgenstein in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.|$|E
5|$|Brown, though {{disappointed}} {{at being}} scooped, congratulated the Ortiz team on their discovery. He apologized for immediately overshadowing their announcement of Haumea with his announcement of Eris, {{and explained that}} someone had accessed their data and {{he was afraid of}} being scooped again. Ortiz did not volunteer to say that it had been he who accessed the data. Upon learning from web server records that it was a computer at the Sierra Nevada Observatory that had accessed his observation logs the day before the discovery announcement—logs which included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images—Brown came to suspect fraud. He emailed Ortiz on August 9 and asked for an explanation. Ortiz did not respond, and on August 15 the Caltech team filed a formal complaint with the IAU, accusing the Ortiz team of a serious breach of scientific ethics in failing to acknowledge their use of the Caltech data, and asked the MPC to strip them of discovery status. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating this was merely part of verifying whether they had discovered a new object. Brown <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> if the Spanish team had actually identified Haumea at all before they saw his own abstract and telescope log.|$|E

25|$|In late March 2012, Hamas began {{offering}} carpools {{for people to}} use Hamas state vehicles to get to work. Many Gazans <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> how these vehicles have fuel themselves, as diesel was completely unavailable in Gaza, ambulances {{could no longer be}} used, but Hamas government officials still had fuel for their own cars. Many Gazans said that Hamas confiscated the fuel it needed from petrol stations and used it exclusively for their own purposes.|$|E
25|$|Flutie {{entered the}} USFL with much hype and fanfare. However, many <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> if the scouts who said Flutie could not compete on the pro level were right. In February 1985, Flutie made his USFL debut against the Orlando Renegades. His debut was not impressive, {{as his first}} two {{professional}} passes were intercepted by Renegades line backer Jeff Gabrielsen. The only two touchdowns that New Jersey scored came from turnovers by Orlando quarterback Jerry Golsteyn. By the time Flutie's debut was over, he completed only 7 of 18 passes, {{for a total of}} 174 yards, while running for 51 yards.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{engaging}} in observable compulsions, {{the person with}} this subtype might perform more covert, mental rituals, or might feel driven to avoid the situations in which particular thoughts seem likely to intrude. As {{a result of this}} avoidance, people can struggle to fulfill both public and private roles, even if they place great value on these roles and even if they had fulfilled the roles successfully in the past. Moreover, the individual's avoidance can confuse others who do not know its origin or intended purpose, {{as it did in the}} case of a man whose wife <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> why he would not hold their infant child. The covert mental rituals can take up a great deal of a person's time during the day.|$|E

500|$|All Saladin's {{best efforts}} could not {{dislocate}} the Crusader column, or halt its {{advance in the}} direction of Arsuf. [...] Richard was determined to hold his army together, forcing the enemy to exhaust themselves in repeated charges, with the intention of holding his knights for a concentrated counter-attack at just the right moment. [...] There were risks in this, because the army was not only marching under severe enemy provocation, but the troops were suffering from heat and thirst. [...] Just as serious, the Saracens were killing so many horses that some of Richard's own knights <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> if a counter-strike would be possible. Many of the unhorsed knights joined the infantry.|$|E
500|$|On 3 April, {{after days}} of {{difficult}} travel, Nansen privately <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> if the pole might, after all, be out of reach. Unless the surface improved, their food would not last them to the pole {{and then on to}} Franz Josef Land. [...] The next day they calculated their position at a disappointing 86°3'; Nansen confided in his diary that: [...] "I have become more and more convinced we ought to turn before time." [...] After making camp on 7 April Nansen scouted ahead on snowshoes looking for a path forward, but saw only [...] "a veritable chaos of iceblocks stretching as far as the horizon". He decided that they would go no further north, and would head for Cape Fligely in Franz Josef Land. Nansen recorded the latitude of their final northerly camp as 86°13.6′N, almost three degrees (169.6 nautical miles, or 314km) beyond Greely's previous Farthest North mark.|$|E
500|$|The story {{developed}} from the character of Mark, who {{is based on the}} first boyfriend of Duncan's oldest daughter. Duncan says he [...] "was a very sick young man, and he was the most charming young man you could ever meet" [...] but that it [...] "wasn't until things got very bad that we discovered {{he was the kind of}} guy who would swerve in the road to run over a dog." [...] She <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> what might happen if a charismatic teenage psychopath was placed in a high school setting and the young people he would attract as followers. 'Then I thought [...] "What could he make them do?" [...] The book moved from there.' Mr. Griffin was based on the personality of a drama teacher one of Duncan's daughters had in high school who [...] "was very strict and demanded that her students do the best work they were capable of doing", but for whom Duncan's daughter was later grateful. Duncan wanted the character to be symbolic of a teacher who is not appreciated at the time, but later is.|$|E

500|$|Jackson and Presley {{appeared}} on the television show Primetime in June 1995. In Jackson's first interview since 1993 and Presley's first ever, Diane Sawyer quizzed the pair on their private life with, according to Jet, a series of [...] "insensitive" [...] questions. Presley boasted that she and Jackson had regular sex, following Sawyer's questioning their sex life. When asked if the marriage was a sham, Presley asserted that such rumors were [...] "crap"; {{she said she would}} never marry someone for any other reason than being in love with him, and concluded that if the public thought differently, they could [...] "eat it". The following day, Presley reflected that the interview had been a disaster; she had hoped the couple would be perceived as being serious, yet Jackson fooled around during the show, at one point holding two fingers behind his wife's head to make bunny ears. Presley's friend Monica Pastelle revealed that it was at this point that Presley <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> whether she had made a mistake in choosing Jackson as a long-term partner.|$|E
500|$|After {{ending his}} playing career for good, Motley asked Brown about a {{coaching}} {{job with the}} team. Brown, however, rejected his overtures, saying Motley should instead look for work at a steel mill – the very career football was his ticket out of. Unable to find coaching opportunities in the NFL, {{he worked as a}} whisky salesman in the early 1960s. He got occasional scouting assignments from the Browns, but as the Civil Rights Movement began to coalesce in 1965, he issued a statement saying he had been refused a permanent coaching position by the team numerous times. He applied for a coaching job in 1964, he wrote, and was told that there were no vacancies. The Browns then hired Bob Nussbaumer as an assistant. [...] "When I heard of the hiring of a new assistant, I <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> if the full reason {{is whether or not the}} time is ripe to hire a Negro coach in Cleveland on the professional level," [...] he wrote. Art Modell, the Browns' owner, responded by saying the team filled its coaching positions based on ability and experience, not race. [...] "We are represented by scouts at every major Negro school. And we now have 12 Negroes signed for the 1965 season," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|On 14 March 1895, {{after two}} false starts {{and with the}} ship's {{position}} at 84°4′N, Nansen and Johansen began their journey. Nansen had allowed 50days to cover the [...] to the pole, an average daily journey of seven nautical miles (13km; 8.1mi). After a week of travel a sextant observation {{indicated that they were}} averaging nine nautical miles a day, (17km; 10mi), putting them ahead of schedule. However, uneven surfaces made skiing more difficult, and their speeds slowed. They also realised that they were marching against a southerly drift, and that distances travelled did not necessarily equate to northerly progression. On 3 April Nansen <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> whether the pole was, indeed, attainable. Unless their speed improved, their food would not last them to the pole and then on to Franz Josef Land. He confided in his diary: [...] "I have become more and more convinced we ought to turn before time." [...] On 7 April, after making camp and observing that the way ahead was [...] "a veritable chaos of iceblocks stretching as far as the horizon", Nansen decided to turn south. He recorded the latitude of the final northerly camp as 86°13.6′N, almost three degrees beyond the previous Farthest North mark.|$|E

500|$|Writing for The Scotsman, Andrea Mullaney articulated, [...] "Theroux {{really had}} found the {{ultimate}} in weirdness for his latest documentary – they're so beyond the point of reason, into a self-perpetuating psychosis, {{that no matter how}} he tried, he couldn't challenge their beamingly-delivered pronouncements, or trip them up. But he did manage to show them as human beings (more than the courtesy they extend to us sinners)." [...] Hilary Fannin of The Irish Times commented that the airing of the documentary, [...] "saw Louis Theroux, in The Most Hated Family in America, shatter another redneck American target, the Westboro Baptist Church". In a review of the documentary for The Sunday Times, Roland White discussed Theroux's stylistic technique, [...] "Theroux's usual technique [...] the friendly ingenue [...] made absolutely no impact on these people. It was like watching a youngster from a village cricket team trying to bowl out Geoff Boycott, and I <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> what Theroux was hoping to achieve. It is impossible to outargue the religious bigot. They have impeccable logic on their side: the word of God is the righteous truth; only they understand the true word of the Lord; therefore, they are right and everybody else is wrong." [...] Liverpool Daily Post recommended the film in its column, [...] "Sunday: What to Watch". Writing for the Birmingham Mail, Graham Young observed, [...] "The Most Hated Family in America is the best documentary from Louis since long before his Michael Jackson fiasco." [...] John Dugdale of The Sunday Times highlighted the film as his [...] "Pick of the day". Dugdale wrote favorably of the film, [...] "There are echoes of Theroux's film about a woman raising her daughters as neo-Nazis as he watches Phelps' daughter, Shirley, handing out placards to kids as young as seven. While tangling with her and her dad is pointless, the family's younger women are less inflexible, and his encounters with them are more rewarding." [...] A review in the Leicester Mercury noted of Theroux's interview techniques, [...] "His subtle interviewing style was perfect for showing off the crazy views of the members." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{hearing of}} the slaughter, Philip II of Spain [...] "laughed, for almost the only time on record". In Paris, the poet Jean-Antoine de Baïf, founder of the Academie de Musique et de Poésie, wrote a sonnet extravagantly praising the killings. On the other hand, the Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian II, King Charles's father-in-law, was sickened, {{describing}} the massacre as [...] "shameful". Moderate French Catholics also <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> whether religious uniformity was {{worth the price of}} such bloodshed and the ranks of the Politiques began to swell.|$|E

All of this had surfaced deep emotions in Don. Also in this episode, Don has jokingly stated he was a [...] "lost cause," [...] when his father expressed a failure in parenting him. On the other hand, in the previous season's [...] "Calculated Risk," [...] Don showed a connection to a boy who had lost his mother, giving hope to Alan that he had done something right.|$|E

Despite its commercial sound, the title track became a fan favourite. The album sold over 2 million copies and the 1984 world tour [...] "The World Crusade" [...] was a success both in Europe and America. In the US they had Mötley Crüe and Krokus as support for many shows of the tour as the band spent one year on the road.
