The sharp division was sealed by the gradual withdrawal of the British from Sutanuti. Even a deep trench, 16 to 18 ft wide, was dug in 1710, ostensibly to drain the White Town but also to separate it from the Black Town in Sutanuti. Even as the English gradually abandoned Sutanuti as a place of abode, there stood at its northern most corner a pleasure resort called Perrin’s Garden, where “once it was the height of gentility for the Company’s covenanted servants to take their ladies for an evening stroll or moonlight fete.” It also gradually fell out of use and repair and was sold out in 1752. With the commencement of construction of the new Fort William, in 1758 and the demolition of Gobindapur, the inhabitants were compensated and given land in Taltala, Kumortuli and Shobhabazar. European inhabitants gradually forsook the narrow limits of the old palisades and moved to around the Maidan.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{horse racing}} {{starting}} barriers were simple ropes or occasionally wooden barriers behind which the horses stood. The first automated design was pioneered in Australia and {{was first used}} at an official race meeting in 1894. [...] Alexander Gray had concluded that the flapping of a starter's flag distracted the horses. An impetus for his invention was a £5 fine received by his son, Reuben, a jockey, for allowing his mount to step over the white chalk line that marked the start. His machine was first tried out at Canterbury Park Racecourse in New South Wales in February 1894. Gray's prototype consisted of a single strand of wire at about {{the height of the}} horse’s head that was attached to a spring at either end. When the device was activated the <b>barrier</b> <b>sprang</b> up and away from the horses. [...] Gray's single-strand barrier was among those first used. Versions of barriers designed by Alexander and Reuben Gray were installed at race tracks in Australia and overseas between 1894 and about 1932. By the 1920s the single strand barrier had evolved into a spring-powered five-strand device designed by Johnstone and Gleeson, but based on Gray's prototype, that resembled a strongman’s chest expander. Barriers assured fair starts to races. Fair race starts encouraged owners to enter horses in races and punters to bet, and they contributed to changing horse racing from a social sporting event into a billion dollar industry.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} examine the {{processes}} of incubating African female entrepreneurs. It is observed that despite the growing interest and large volume of literature on business incubation and their role in local economic growth, theories have been silent on explaining the role(s) of “female incubatees” within this process. The particular focus {{of this paper is}} on our current {{understanding of the nature of}} the complex processes of providing business support services to female entrepreneurs in Africa, an analysis of how incubation might address those challenges, and some tentative lessons drawn from our empirical research and entrepreneurs` own experiences. Therefore, this paper includes information and analysis on a number of business incubation initiatives, but its goal is to provide an understanding of what might work in the incubation industry and, in particular, why in specific circumstances female-owned businesses fail or succeed in the competitive business environment, which is often dominated by men. Its focus, therefore, is on incubation as means, not ends, as policies that enable businesses to overcome barriers during both pre and post-establishment. The local policies, enterprises and institutions form a significant part of this paper. Although it has been well documented that African female entrepreneurs are constrained by structural, cultural and institutional <b>barriers</b> (<b>Spring</b> and MacDade, 2005; Kyaruzi and Hales, 2006), the solutions to overcoming such barriers remain problematic. Also, their roles in the incubation processes are rarely mentioned in most policies on entrepreneurship in Africa. In an attempt to understand the mysterious concepts behind this one sided view, this paper draws its conclusions from studies conducted in Senegal and Tanzania {{to examine the}} role(s) of female entrepreneurs within the incubation process. Data was drawn from 160 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania firms and 40 female-owned businesses in Dakar, Senegal. The findings suggest that in most cases, the theories appear to treat the incubators and the business incubation processes as unproblematic institutions or policy tools for creating businesses and stimulating local economic growth through employment creation and taxes generated from new ventures. The conclusions suggest a need for more empirical studies on incubation processes and calls for new ways of incubating female entrepreneurs to realise their potential contributions to local economic growth. Since they have social and economic roles to play in contributing to local economic growth, our paper suggests that it is of significant importance to understand the processes and policies that are directed towards nurturing and supporting their ventures. This, and other elements that have been mentioned in this paper will enable policymakers and bilateral institutions to direct resources where they are mostly needed i. e. training, empowerment, capacity building and backup support...|$|R
40|$|Migratory divides are contact zones between {{breeding}} {{populations that}} use divergent migratory routes {{and have been}} described {{in a variety of}} species. These divides are of major importance to evolution, ecology and conservation but have been identified using limited band recovery data and/or indirect methods. Data from band recoveries and mitochondrial haplotypes suggested that inland and coastal Swainson's thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) form a migratory divide in western North America. We attached light-level geolocators to birds at the edges of this contact zone to provide, to our knowledge, the first direct test of a putative divide using data from individual birds over the entire annual cycle. Coastal thrushes migrated along the west coast to Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. Some of these birds used multiple wintering sites. Inland thrushes migrated across the Rocky Mountains, through central North America to Columbia and Venezuela. These birds migrated longer distances than coastal birds and performed a loop migration, navigating over the Gulf of Mexico in autumn and around this <b>barrier</b> in <b>spring.</b> These findings support the suggestion that divergent migratory behaviour could contribute to reproductive isolation between migrants, advance our understanding of their non-breeding ecology, and are integral to development of detailed conservation strategies for this group...|$|R

This partition leads to mathematical properties of the transition matrices which can be exploited further such as to establish connections with the dynamical theory of unstable periodic orbits.

The unique consumption of wrack fauna at Anclote Key co-occurs with comparatively low infaunal densities and biomass, and modified ghost crab behavior due to trait-mediated effects. My results are novel because they suggest that wrack-associated fauna may be an important food source for ghost crabs in certain beach regimes...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{extensive}} ongoing {{efforts on}} improving the long-term prediction of El Niño-Southern Oscillation, the predictability in state-of-the-art operational schemes remains limited by {{factors such as}} the <b>spring</b> <b>barrier</b> and the influence of atmospheric winds. Recent research suggests that the 2014 / 15 El Niño (EN) event was stalled {{as a result of an}} unusually strong basin-wide easterly wind burst in June, which led to the discharge of a large fraction of the subsurface ocean heat. Here we use observational records and numerical experiments to explore the sensitivity of EN to the magnitude of the heat buildup occurring in the ocean subsurface 21 months in advance. Our simulations suggest that a large increase in heat content during this phase can lead to basin-wide uniform warm conditions in the equatorial Pacific the winter before the occurrence of a very strong EN event. In our model configuration, the system compensates any initial decrease in heat content and naturally evolves towards a new recharge, resulting in a delay of up to one year in the occurrence of an EN event. Both scenarios substantiate the non-linear dependency between the intensity of the subsurface heat buildup and the magnitude and timing of subsequent EN episodes...|$|R
60|$|It must be {{conceived}} {{that there was}} some feeling of triumph at Plumstead Episcopi, when the wife of the rector returned home with her daughter, the bride elect of the Lord Dumbello. The heir of the Marquess of Hartletop was, in wealth, the most considerable unmarried young nobleman of the day; he was noted, too, as a man difficult to be pleased, as one who was very fine and who gave himself airs; and to have been selected as the wife of such a man as this was a great thing for the daughter of a parish clergyman. We have seen in what manner the happy girl's mother communicated the fact to Lady Lufton, hiding, as it were, her pride under a veil; and we have seen also how meekly the happy girl bore her own great fortune, applying herself humbly to the packing of her clothes, as though she ignored her own glory. But nevertheless there was triumph at Plumstead Episcopi. The mother, when she returned home, began to feel that she had been thoroughly successful in the great object of her life. While she was yet in London she had hardly realized her satisfaction, and there were doubts then whether the cup might not be dashed from her lips before it was tasted. It might be that even the son of the Marquess of Hartletop was subject to parental authority, and that <b>barriers</b> should <b>spring</b> up between Griselda and her coronet; but there had been nothing of the kind.

Lord Dumbello was a man who had a will of his own--as the Grantlys boasted amongst themselves. Poor Griselda! the day may perhaps come when this fact of her lord's masterful will may not to her be matter of much boasting. But in London, as I was saying, there had been no time for an appreciation of the family joy.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} analysis of the monthly, seasonal and interannual rainfall variabilities over the Maritime Continent and describes the potentials and limits {{of a wide range of}} climate models in simulating these variabilities. The study analyzes the simulated rainfall variability from two global reanalyses, an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM), an atmospheric regional climate model (RCM) and an ocean general circulation model (OGCM). The two reanalyses and the AGCM output is available at T 42 and T 106 resolutions, while the RCM resolves 0. 5 ° and 1 / 6 °. The study explores the uncoupled as well as the coupled mode of RCM and OGCM and focuses mainly on the period 1979 to 1993. With a regionalization method introduced in this study, the Maritime Continent is divided into three distinct climate regions, the south monsoonal, the northwest semi-monsoonal and the Molucca anti-monsoonal region. All three regions show different responses to monsoon and El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Two important rainfall variabilities ranging from monthly to interannualy time scale are the annual monsoon cycle and the irregular ENSO. The monsoon regulates local SST variability via ocean circulation, which in turn influences heat content of the upper ocean and eventually local rainfall. The study points to remote ENSO influences through SST forcing. Indeed, there is a local ocean circulation mechanism that drives the ENSO impact on Indonesian rainfall. The rainfall climate of this region is potentially predictable on monthly and seasonal scales but only for limited and specific periods and regions. Despite such a potential, the study shows a consistent predictability <b>barrier</b> in <b>spring</b> as an intrinsic character of the Indonesian rainfall and a challenge to climate modeling in the region, because it limits model applications. The barrier is found by all models and at different resolutions. The RCM and the OGCM have been especially tailored to the region and they produce realistic results. The global atmospheric model produces the large scale system well and the nested regional model shows a local phenomenon obscured in the global. A coupled atmosphere/ocean regional model shows improved dynamics through a better sea-air interaction and ocean/atmosphere feedback. However, also the uncoupled ocean and atmosphere models, separately, produce realistic results of rainfall and ocean variability albeit with some drawbacks. The quality of the RCM simulations is confined, in most cases, to the quality of the prescribed boundary forcings...|$|R

In contrast, the central Pacific SST indices (NINO 3. 4 and NINO 4) experienced little decadal barrier variability and have had their persistence <b>barriers</b> fixed in <b>spring</b> in the past four decades. The zonal mean OHC index averaged over the equatorial Pacific shows decadal barrier changes similar to those in the eastern Pacific SST indices and always leads the NINO 3 SST barrier by about one season. It is noticed that the SST persistence barrier appeared first in the eastern Pacific before 1976 / 1977, first in the central Pacific between 1976 / 1977 and 1989 / 1990, and almost simultaneous in both the eastern and central Pacific after 1989 / 1990. These timings coincide with the westward propagating, eastward propagating, and standing pattern of ENSO SST anomalies observed in these three periods. These results suggest that ENSO SST anomalies in the equatorial Pacific can be considered to consist of two different processes: a central Pacific process whose phase transition (such as onset) and barrier always happen in spring, and an eastern Pacific process whose phase transition and barrier change from decade to decade and are influenced by changes in the mean thermocline depth along the equatorial Pacific...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{increase}} in availability of high-performance computing (HPC) resources in South Africa allowed {{the development of}} an ocean–atmosphere coupled general circulation model (OAGCM). The ECHAM 4. 5 -South African Weather Service (SAWS) Modular Oceanic Model version 3 (MOM 3 -SA) is the first OAGCM to be developed in Africa for seasonal climate prediction. This model employs an initialization strategy that is different from previous versions of the model that coupled the same atmosphere and ocean models. Evaluation of hindcasts performed with the model revealed that the OAGCM is successful in capturing the development and maturity of El Niño and La Niña episodes up to 8 months ahead. A model intercomparison also indicated that the ECHAM 4. 5 -MOM 3 -SA has skill levels for the Niño- 3. 4 region SST comparable with other coupled models administered by international centers. Further analysis of the coupled model revealed that La Niña events are more skillfully discriminated than El Niño events. However, as is typical for OAGCM, the model skill was generally found to decay faster during the <b>spring</b> <b>barrier.</b> The analysis also showed that the coupled model has useful skill up to several-months lead time when predicting the equatorial Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) during the period spanning between the middle of austral spring and the start of the summer seasons, which reaches its peak in November. The weakness of the model in other seasons was mainly caused by the western segment of the dipole, which eventually contaminates the dipole mode index (DMI). The model is also able to forecast the anomalous upper air circulations, particularly in the equatorial belt, and surface air temperature in the Southern African region as opposed to precipitation.

5000|$|The first arc {{opens with}} Jason Blood and Madame Xanadu {{arriving}} at the town of Little Spring. While in the local tavern, they find themselves among the likes of Vandal Savage, Sir Ystin, Al Jabr, and Exoristos. Outside the town, the impending horde of The Questing Queen and Mordru composed of barbarians, magically enchanted dinosaurs, and mechanical man-powered dragons is heading towards the town. [...] The Queen wishes to go through Little Spring to reach the rich city of Alba Sarum and take it by surprise. When the horde meets resistance from the heroes, the Queen decides the only choice of action is to contain and destroy the town. Vandal tells the villagers that {{the only means of}} survival is to evacuate, having once served in the Questing Queen's horde. However to save the town from an oncoming fireball, Xanadu creates a magical <b>barrier</b> sealing Little <b>Spring</b> inside and out until sunrise. The Horsewoman is able to get through the barrier and heads to warn Alba Sarum and bring reinforcements. As the heroes and villagers prepare for the battle to come, Sir Ystin receives a vision from Merlin. He reveals to Ystin the source of his immortality and his yearning to seek the holy grail. Merlin also explains that Camelot itself is a city which is reincarnated over the centuries, meaning to be the best of humanity but always falling before its time. [...] Vandal defects to the Queen, escaping Little Spring by an underground passage, and is made general for her forces. Finally day breaks, and Xanadu's barrier falls. [...] The result is a brutal slaughter of the villagers of Little Spring. Vandal reveals his real intentions were to capture the horde's supply lines for himself but is discovered by the Queen. She open fires on her own forces which causes routing and chaos. The forces of Alba Sarum arrive and force the Questing Queen to retreat but Little Spring and its people are devastated.|$|R
40|$|As {{a global}} climate phenomenon, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) {{involves}} the coupling {{of the ocean}} and the atmosphere. Most climate prediction studies have, by far, only investigated the teleconnections between global climatic anomalies and the ‘surface’ predictors of ENSO. The prediction models resulting from these studies have generally suffered from inadequate, if not the lack of, skill across the so-called boreal ‘spring barrier’. This is illustrated {{in the first part of}} this thesis where the applicability of the SOI phase for long-lead rainfall projections in Australia is discussed. With the increasing availability of subsurface ocean temperature data, the characteristics of the Pacific Ocean’s heat content and its role in ENSO are now better understood. The second part of this thesis investigated the predictability of ENSO using the thermocline as a predictor. While the persistence and SST-based ENSO hindcasts dropped in skill across the <b>spring</b> <b>barrier,</b> the thermocline-based hindcasts remained skillful even up to a lag of eighteen months. Continuing on the favorable results of ENSO prediction, the third part of this thesis extended the use of the thermocline in the prediction of Australia’s rainfall and streamflow. When compared to models that use ‘surface’ predictors, the model that incorporated thermocline information resulted in more skillful projections of rainfall and streamflow especially at long lead-times. More importantly, significant increases in skill of autumn and winter projections demonstrate the ability of the subsurface ocean to retain some climatic memory across the predictability barrier. This resilience can be attributed to the high persistence of the ocean heat content during the first half of the year. Based on weighting, the model averaging exercise also affirmed the superiority of the ‘subsurface’ model over the ‘surface’ models in terms of streamflow projections. The encouraging findings of this study could have far-reaching implications not only to the science of ENSO prediction but also to the more pragmatic realm of hydrologic forecasting. What this study has demonstrated is an alternative predictor that is suitable for the long range forecasting of ENSO, rainfall and streamflow. With better hydrologic forecasting comes significant improvement in the management of reservoirs which eventually leads to an increase in the reliability and sufficiency of water supply provision...|$|R
40|$|Influenza A viruses {{are major}} {{pathogens}} for humans, domestic animals and wildlife that cross the species <b>barrier</b> occasionally. In <b>spring</b> 2014, increased mortality of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) {{was reported in}} Sweden and Denmark, associated with infection with an influenza A(H 10 N 7) virus. Within a few months, this virus spread to seals of the coastal waters of Germany and the Netherlands, causing the death of thousands of animals. Genetic analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of this seal influenza A(H 10 N 7) virus revealed that it was most closely related to various avian influenza A(H 10 N 7) viruses. The collection of samples from infected seals {{during the course of}} the outbreak provided an unique opportunity to follow the adaptation of this avian virus to its new seal host. Sequence data was obtained from samples collected from 41 different seals from four different countries between April 2014 and January 2015 using Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing to describe the molecular epidemiology of the seal influenza A(H 10 N 7) virus. The majority of sequence variation occurred in the HA gene, and some mutations corresponded with amino acid changes not found in H 10 viruses isolated from Eurasian birds. Also, sequence variation in the HA gene was greater at the beginning than at the end of the epidemic, when a number of the mutations observed earlier had been fixed. These results imply that when an avian influenza virus jumps the species barrier from birds to seals, amino acid changes in the HA may occur rapidly and are important for virus adaptation to its new mammalian host. IMPORTANCE: Influenza A viruses are major pathogens for humans, domestic animals and wildlife. In addition to the continuous circulation of influenza A viruses among various host species, cross-species transmission of influenza A viruses occurs occasionally. Wild waterfowl and shorebirds are the main reservoir for most influenza A virus subtypes, and spillover of influenza A viruses from birds to humans or other mammalian species may result in major outbreaks. In the present study, various sequencing methods were used to elucidate the genetic changes that occurred after the introduction and subsequent spread of an avian influenza A(H 10 N 7) among harbor seals of Northwestern Europe using various samples collected during the outbreak. Such detailed knowledge of genetic changes necessary for introduction and adaptation of avian influenza A viruses to mammalian hosts is important for a rapid risk assessment of such viruses soon after they cross the species barrier...|$|R
