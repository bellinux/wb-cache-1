5|$|The Godwins were {{constantly}} in debt, so Godwin returned to writing {{to support the}} family. He and his wife started a Juvenile Library for which he wrote children's books. In 1807, when Fanny was 13, they moved from the Polygon, where Godwin had lived with Wollstonecraft, to 41 Skinner Street, near Clerkenwell, in the city's <b>bookselling</b> district. This took the family away from the fresh country air and into the dirty, smelly, inner streets of London. Although initially successful, the business gradually failed. The Godwins also continued to borrow more money than they could afford from generous friends such as publisher Joseph Johnson and Godwin devotee Francis Place.|$|E
5|$|Acquired in 1995 by the Thorn EMI group, Dillons was the UK's {{second largest}} {{bookseller}} behind Waterstones {{and was the}} <b>bookselling</b> arm of EMI's retail division, which included HMV. Following the demerger of Thorn and EMI in 1996, the retail arm was divested from the EMI portfolio within a year and spun off into the HMV Media Group, an investment venture between EMI Group and Advent International private equity group. This venture included HMV, Dillons and Waterstones (the latter bought from WHSmith for £300 million), combining to make an international entertainment retailer of over 500 stores. Following a rebuffed takeover attempt in 1997 of WHSmith, Tim Waterstone {{became part of the}} deal and by May 1998, following the £801 million deal completion became chairman of the group. All Dillons stores were incorporated within the Waterstones brand by 1998.|$|E
5|$|In January 2010, HMV Group {{announced}} that Waterstones like-for-like sales over the Christmas period were down 8.5 per cent {{on the previous}} year. This culminated in the resignation of managing director Gerry Johnson with immediate effect. He was replaced by development director Dominic Myers, who was {{managing director of the}} British academic <b>bookselling</b> chain Blackwells until 2005. Myers joined HMV in 2006 to oversee the integration of Ottakar's into the chain. In response to the decline in sales, he implemented a three-year plan in which branches were tailored to their local market alongside a 'rejuvenation' of the company brand and an increase in range. As part of these changes, Waterstones implemented new branding in May 2010, developed by agency VentureThree. The company also moved to support the Rainbow Trust, which provides support to children with life-threatening and terminal illnesses and their families, in the same year.|$|E
5|$|John Ebers, a bookseller, {{took over}} the {{management}} of the theatre in 1821, and seven more London premieres of Rossini operas (La gazza ladra, Il turco in Italia, Mosè in Egitto, Otello, La donna del lago, Matilde di Shabran and Ricciardo e Zoraide) took place there in the following three years. Ebers sublet the theatre to Giambattista Benelli in 1824, and Rossini was invited to conduct, remaining for a five-month season, with his wife Isabella Colbran performing. Two more of his operas, Zelmira and Semiramide, received their British premieres during the season, but the theatre sustained huge losses and Benelli absconded without paying either the composer or the artists. Ebers engaged Giuditta Pasta for the 1825 season, but he became involved in lawsuits which, combined with a large increase in the rent of the theatre, forced him into bankruptcy, after which he returned to his <b>bookselling</b> business.|$|E

25|$|Besides merchants, a {{great number}} of {{physicians}} were among the Spanish Jews in Amsterdam: Samuel Abravanel, David Nieto, Elijah Montalto, and the Bueno family; Joseph Bueno was consulted in the illness of Prince Maurice (April 1623). Jews were admitted as students at the university, where they studied medicine as the only branch of science of practical use to them, for they were not permitted to practise law, and the oath they would be compelled to take excluded them from the professorships. Neither were Jews taken into the trade-guilds: a resolution passed by the city of Amsterdam in 1632 (the cities being autonomous) excluded them. Exceptions, however, were made in the case of trades that related to their religion: printing, <b>bookselling,</b> and the selling of meat, poultry, groceries, and drugs. In 1655 a Jew was, exceptionally, permitted to establish a sugar-refinery.|$|E

The store on Exchange Place was divided into two sections, with Appleton's son William later taking charge of the <b>bookselling</b> functions. After five years of partnership, and feeling he could continue his business without further capital infusions from his brother-in-law, Jonathan Leavitt went into business for himself, opening a store at Broadway and John Streets and hiring George Palmer Putnam (then aged 16) as his apprentice and right-hand man. Appleton and his son subsequently moved their business to what was known as Clinton Hall, on Beekman Street, where they established themselves as well-known booksellers. With his partnership with Appleton dissolved, Leavitt became the leading publisher of religious and theological works in New York city.|$|E

In 1905, James responded frustratingly to {{what he described as}} [...] "a beguiled infatuation" [...] with Austen, a rising tide of public interest that exceeded Austen's [...] "intrinsic merit and interest".

This was followed by another review by Defoe on 6 December, in which he {{even went so far}} as to provide a draft text for the bill.

Stephen Jones of the Best New Horror series has said that winning the anthology award for their first volume in 1991 helped [...] "establish the series among readers and some publishers" [...] in multiple countries. Winners such as Nnedi Okorafor—Best Novel in 2011—have described the award as [...] "one of my greatest honors as a writer". Editor and bookseller Rick Klaw in 2007, however, noted that the consensus at the time [...] "in the <b>bookselling</b> community" [...] was that winning the novel category did not have any effect on sales and did not help keep the book in print, with 57 percent of prior winners out of print, compared to 23 percent of Hugo Award winners from the same time period.|$|E

Waterstones embarked on a major restructuring of staffing levels, with a company-wide consultation with 560 managerial staff to subsequently reduce roles within the company. This consultation led to Head Office staff departures and around 200 branch and regional managers leaving their posts. Waterstones launched a number of new partnerships through the year, including with the University of Derby to launch a professional qualification programme for its staff, with the Folio Society to extend customer reach and stock selection in London-based bookshops, and partnering with a new charity, BookTrust.

2500|$|On the June 4, 2014 episode, Colbert briefly {{broke down}} {{the details of}} a dispute that Amazon was having with book {{publisher}} Hachette, who has printed every book he has authored (and is the issuer for thousands more authors). In an LA Times interview; fellow Hachette author James Patterson expressed fear in regard to the depths Amazon will go to maintain control over book pricing, publishing, and sales of any e-retail in general. The main issue between the two companies is of e-book sales, and Amazon's lowering of prices to what certain publishers consider unsustainable for their business. Considering Amazon's domination when it comes to <b>bookselling</b> (between 40 and 50% of all book sales) and the myriad products it has since taken to selling due to its success with literature, it is slowing down or halting all sales of published or upcoming books produced by Hachette with no end in sight, notifying potential customers {{that it would be a}} better decision to shop elsewhere for any Hachette books. In response to his books being delayed or outright banned from being ordered, Colbert (as well as fellow Hachette author Sherman Alexie) encouraged the Colbert Nation to order California from first-time author Edan Lepucki from Portland, Oregon bookseller Powell's Books linked to Colbert's website (as well as [...] "I Didn't Buy It on Amazon" [...] stickers) and urged fans to refuse to purchase anything from Amazon until the conflict is resolved in a fair way. On the July 21 episode, Colbert repeated the experiment, asking Lepucki for a recommendation of another Hachette author. Lepucki gave the nod to Stephan Eirik Clark who authored Sweetness #9.|$|E
