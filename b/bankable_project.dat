The Government has prioritised the participation of private sector in the development of LAPSSET Corridor infrastructure through infrastructure bonds and equity participation among other money market instruments. There is already significant private sector interest being registered towards the implementation of these project components hence the need has arisen for the government to structure and package <b>bankable</b> <b>projects</b> that are investor ready for uptake by private sector.|$|R

This briefing suggests that claims that PPPs should be {{a central part of}} any attempt to address SDG commitments should be viewed with caution. Prioritisation of PPPs may bias governments towards <b>bankable</b> <b>projects</b> rather than initiatives which best respond to social development objectives. Claims that PPPs are more efficient, better transfer risk and therefore represent better value-for-money are not backed up by the evidence.

40|$|This Background Paper on Vanuatu {{reviews the}} {{development}} of monetary control instruments in five small island economies in the South Pacific (Fiji, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu, and Western Samoa) and draws some lessons from their experience. The paper highlights that, except Solomon Islands which have extraordinarily high credit demand from the government, these economies have large structural excess liquidity in the banking system. The paper describes the financial sector in the five economies and analyzes the background for large excess liquidity. It also reviews the developments of monetary instruments in these economies from a comparative perspective.

40|$|After {{several years}} of transition, major {{weaknesses}} in the banking and enterprise sectors remain {{the root cause of}} low growth. A large share of nonperforming assets in the portfolio of large banks, stemming from losses in the enterprise sector, has been a key impediment to financial sector development. The banking system has been crippled with low levels of intermediation, high cost of capital, severe lack of financial discipline, and poor allocation of credit. Reforms aimed at strengthening lending practices, encouraging foreign bank participation, improving bank supervision and, above all, a consolidation process that breaks away from the past are helping pave the path to economic recovery.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} link between {{financial}} development and {{economic growth in the}} West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). Using panel data for WAEMU countries over the period 1995 - 2006, the results suggest that while financial development does support growth in the region, long-term bank financing has a greater impact on economic growth than short-term financing because long-term projects have higher returns adjusted for risks. Given that in the WAEMU short-term credit accounts for about 70 percent of credit to the private sector, WAEMU countries are less able to reap the full benefits of improvements in their financial systems. The results also highlight the importance of macroeconomic stability, a creditor-friendly environment, political stability, and the availability of long-term financial resources in fostering banks’ supply of long-term loans.

40|$|The G 20 is {{committed}} to promoting infrastructure investment and has called on multilateral development banks (MDBs) to increase their infrastructure lending to help boost global growth. Alongside long-standing MDBs such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB), new MDBs such as the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB) and the New Development Bank have been established, and G 20 members would like both old and new multilateral banks to scale up their infrastructure investment by developing a pipeline of <b>bankable</b> <b>projects.</b> Even with all the MDBs investing more, {{they will not be}} able to satisfy the global need for infrastructure. What they can do, however, is start to fill the infrastructure gap by catalyzing private investment and cooperating on standards and regional infrastructure. Concerns have been raised about the geo-political implications of the new MDBs which underscore the need for MDB cooperation. There are challenges to and opportunities for this cooperation. The G 20 needs to be clear about the role it can play in encouraging MDB cooperation and infrastructure investment, and must also be aware of the limitations on its role given that each MDB has its own mandate. Specifically, the G 20 can downplay the perceived trade-off between efficiency and standards in the MDBs, encourage cooperation on new standards for sustainable or green infrastructure, invest in the Global Connectivity Alliance as a coordinating body for the MDBs and help align the G 20 work on infrastructure with the United Nations Sustainable Development Agend...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MDF) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2010. The Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) Treaty aims at {{achieving}} regional integration, poverty alleviation {{and economic}} growth. Water is a catalyst to these aims, thus making it key {{for the region}} to manage and develop water resources. Water in the SADC region is a shared resource among the countries, making joint development of the resource important for peace and prosperity. SADC has been promoting transboundary water resources management among its member states. The region {{has done a lot}} of work in establishing an enabling environment for the management of water resources. The SADC Protocol for Shared Watercourses (the “Watercourses Protocol”), the Regional Water Policy (the “Water Policy”) and the Regional Water Strategy (the “Water Strategy”) are all instruments that have been developed to support the management of water resources. However, the region remains heavily under-developed in terms of water infrastructure and in order for the region to develop its water resources, the SADC secretariat has developed a Regional Strategic Water Infrastructure Development Programme (referred to as the “SADC Programme for water infrastructure development” in this study). The Programme is aimed at responding to the lack of infrastructural development in the region and identifies regional water projects to be implemented. Water is a sector that struggles in attracting private sector funding and involvement. This study aims to look into ways that the private sector can been attracted to participate in the Programme for water infrastructure development and also proposes ways they can be engaged. Private-sector involvement varies from project identification to project implementation and funding. To attract the private sector to participate in the SADC Programme for water infrastructure development, SADC and the member states have to build on the enabling environment established in the region and also on relationships based on existing institutions. The private sector needs to be assured of good market potential and sound financial returns. This can be achieved if the region better co-ordinates the prioritization of regional projects through integrated planning. NEPAD and SADC working closely together, to issue that a consistent development agenda is communicated to potential investors, could add value and avoid duplication. It is also important to link to national development priorities {{in order to ensure that}} local issues are addressed. Capacity of the public sector to support regional projects is also important – capacity to develop <b>bankable</b> <b>projects,</b> develop financing mechanisms and to implement the projects is required at all levels. The SADC region lacks capacity to participate in complex infrastructure projects and this has to be addressed through establishing a Private Public Partnership Unit at the SADC Secretariat. Capacity to also manage and regulate water services is lacking in a number of countries in the region. These are important issues to ensure fair pricing and to give the private sector confidence on issues of tariff setting. To attract private funding into the water sector the region needs to develop innovative financing mechanisms in order to leverage market-based repayable finance. In the implementation of the SADC Programme for water infrastructure development there is a need to evaluate various types of innovative financial instruments and assess their potential use for regional water projects. Local capital markets in a number of the countries are weak, therefore the implementation of the SADC Protocol on Finance and Investment (the “Finance Protocol”) is important in strengthening these markets. Political will and good governance within member states are also important in attracting investors. SADC as the promoter of infrastructure policies in the region should play a proactive role in encouraging its member states to observe the rule of law and also to use existing treaties within SADC to ensure countries do so. Poor governance and unstable economies are a disincentive for private sector involvement...|$|R
40|$|Both {{finance and}} {{construction}} of major projects have dramatically evolved {{in the past ten}} years. Technological breakthrough such as computer orientated design, new cements, new machines have led to a more efficient production process. In the mean time, project financing has been greatly advanced and new techniques have appeared. Large and complex projects have started to be partially funded by the private sector {{as a result of the}} will to cut public spending. Indeed, States and governments realized that the returns should be taken more seriously in publicly supported infrastructure projects. To make many <b>projects</b> <b>bankable,</b> new mixes of public-private partnership with new financing schemes have been developed. Financial engineers have developed new securities, backed by the future stream of cash flows generated by the project income. Those securities, enhanced by risk-specialized agencies, will maybe constitute a major innovation and will allow financial engineers to access a new set of investors: small bondholders. This thesis is focused on one such scheme: the financing of the Stade de France. by Bruno Bouygues. Thesis (S. M.)
