[...] Since <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs</b> are the vectors of the virus, environmental conditions favorable to <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs</b> could increase the spread of the virus. Planococcus njalensis population density is closely correlated with density of ants in the Crematogaster genus, which build protective carton tents over the <b>mealy</b> <b>bug</b> colonies. [...] High-density planting can facilitate the spread of the virus when <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs</b> are able to go from plant to plant through the interlocked canopy. [...] Aside from crawling from plant to plant, <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs</b> can be dispersed by wind as well. In controlled trials, 340 feet was the maximum distance a <b>mealy</b> <b>bug</b> could be spread from an infected plant to a cacao seedling by wind dispersal.

30|$|The <b>mealy</b> <b>bug</b> ladybird, Cryptolaemus montrouzieri (Mulsant) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} biological control agents that preys upon a wide range of <b>mealy</b> <b>bug</b> species in many parts of the world (Simmonds et al. 2000). Both larvae and adults feed on all stages of <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs,</b> (Jayaraman et al., 1988). The first introduction of this ladybird for biological control dates back to 1891 when Albert Koebele brought it into California for control of Planococcus citri Risso (Bartlett 1974). Since then, the beetle has been introduced into several countries in biological control programs with varied success (Dixon 2000). The predator was introduced to Turkey from the USA in 1965 to control P. citri on citrus trees (Oncuer and Bayhan 1982), and it was introduced to Syria from Turkey in 1995; since then, it is reared at the Lattakia Center for Rearing Natural Enemies, Tartous Research Center and Biological Control Studies and Research Center. Rearing program of the predator in Syria aims to mass rear and release it periodically during the season to control citrus <b>mealy</b> <b>bug</b> in the western coast of Syria (Al-Khateeb and Asslan 2007; Al-Khateeb et al. 2012; Al-Khateeb and Raie 2002).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Mango Mangenifera indica L, {{the king}} of all fruits is {{cultivated}} in about 7, 50, 000 hectares in Indian subcontinent. The varieties like hapus, grafted and hybrids {{are more susceptible to}} insect pests including <b>Mealy</b> <b>bugs,</b> Drosicha mangiferae Green (Hemiptera: Coccidae). Therefore, incidence and damage caused by D. mangiferae on mango verities hapus, grafted and hybrids have been studied from Kolhapur district during the years 2011 - 2013. The pest occurred on the crop in December and caused extensive damage to crop by sucking cell sap from tender leaves, stem, flowering and fruiting bodies which resulted in extensive fall of flowering and fruiting bodies. The <b>Mealy</b> <b>bug</b> population was associated with crop up to ripening of fruits which disfigured and made the fruits insipid in the Kolhapur region. Hapus, grafted and other hybrid verities of Mango were equally susceptible to <b>Mealy</b> <b>bug</b> attack in the region. Preventive control measures are suggested in the paper...|$|R

40|$|The coccinellid Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Muls. is an oligophagous {{predator}} {{that is used}} {{to control}} <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs</b> in the orchards and greenhouses.

This research was conducted to study biological characteristics of C. montrouzieri on citrus soft scale and <b>mealy</b> <b>bug,</b> Planococcus citri. Initially, Cryptolaemus eggs were collected from colonies of two preys and reared in laboratory (14 L: 10 D, 25 ± 1 ˚C, and RH 70 ± 5 %). The incubation period of eggs, 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd and, 4 th larval instars, and total larval, prepupal, and pupal stages were studied on two preys. The developmental stages on two preys were not significantly different, except for the 4 th larval instar at 1 % and total larval stages at 5 %. The sex ratio of male to female on two preys were not significantly different at 1 % and was 1 : 1. Except for pre-oviposition period, other parameters including female longevity, average number of eggs laid per day, average total number of eggs laid per female and percentage of hatching were significantly different at 1 % on the two preys.

The wood vinegars were obtained from carbonizationprocess using a 200 -liter fuel tank as charcoal brazier under temperatures of 300 - 400 °C. In this study, termiticidal and pesticidalactivities of wood vinegars were evaluated against termite workers, Odontotermes sp., and striped <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs,</b> Ferrisiavirgata, using direct contact application. Percent mortalities in the experiments were recorded after 24 hours and correctedfor control mortality with Abbott’s formula.

Wood vinegar A exhibited high termiticidal activity against termite workers at a dilutionof 1 : 50, wood vinegar: sterile water (v/v). By this way, 85 % (81. 71 % corrected mortality) of termite workers were killed afterthe 24 hours of test. At a dilution of 1 : 10, both wood vinegar A and B had exhibited high pesticidal activities against mealybugs, 96 % (95. 12 % corrected mortality) of striped <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs</b> were killed by those wood vinegars.
