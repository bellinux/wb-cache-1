5|$|In the confusion, Whitlam and his {{advisers}} did not immediately tell any Senate members of the dismissal, {{with the result that}} when the Senate convened at 2.00pm, the appropriation <b>bills</b> <b>were</b> rapidly passed, with the ALP senators assuming the Opposition had given in. The <b>bills</b> <b>were</b> soon sent to Kerr to receive Royal Assent. At 2.34pm, ten minutes after supply had been secured, Fraser rose in the House and announced he was prime minister. Whitlam immediately moved a no confidence motion against the new prime minister in the House, which instructed the Speaker, Gordon Scholes, to advise Kerr to reinstate Whitlam.|$|E

In February 1903, Parliament {{had established a}} Royal Commission on London Traffic to assess {{the manner in which}} transport in London should be developed. While the Commission deliberated, any review of bills for new lines and extensions was postponed. Both <b>bills</b> <b>were</b> later withdrawn by their promoters.

Where the objection prevails, a motion that the <b>Bill</b> <b>be</b> passed may be brought forward on any future day. No amendments, not being merely verbal shall be made to any Bill after such a motion is moved.|$|R

Competing measures affecting pool halls were introduced – one would have lifted most of the restrictions on their operation while another would have banned them altogether. Bradley added an anti-lynching law to the legislative agenda. However, none of these <b>bills</b> <b>were</b> acted on; {{the vast majority of the}} Assembly's attention during the session was focused on the election of a U.S. Senator.|$|E
25|$|The <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced}} February 27, 2007 in the 110th Congress by Representative Rick Boucher (D-VA).

5|$|The CCE's two <b>bills</b> <b>were</b> {{submitted}} to Parliament {{at the same}} time as a large number of other bills for underground railways in the capital. As it had done in 1892, Parliament established a joint committee under Lord Windsor to review the bills. By the time the committee had produced its report, the parliamentary session was almost over and the promoters of the <b>bills</b> <b>were</b> asked to resubmit them for the following 1902 session. Bills No. 1 and No. 2 were resubmitted in November 1901 together with a new bill – bill No. 3. The new bill modified the route of the proposed extension to Golders Green and added a short extension running beneath Charing Cross main line station to the Victoria Embankment where it would provide an interchange with the existing MDR station (then called Charing Cross).|$|E
5|$|The Royal Commission {{investigations}} continued from 1903 {{to early}} 1905, concluding {{with the issue}} of a report in June 1905. No <b>bills</b> <b>were</b> submitted for the 1904 parliamentary session, but in November 1904 the GNP announced two bills for the 1905 session.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bills</b> <b>were</b> again {{examined}} by a joint committee, this time under Lord Ribblesdale.

5|$|During this session, the Native Hawaiian legislators {{attempted}} to pass new {{laws in the}} interest of the local people, who included Hawaiian taro farmers, patients of the Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement and victims of the 1900 Chinatown fire, among others. In total, fifty-one <b>bills</b> <b>were</b> introduced in the Senate and one hundred and twenty-six in the House, although only nineteen <b>bills</b> <b>were</b> submitted by both houses for ratification. They proposed creating a governmentally funded education program for poor Hawaiian students similar to the Education of Hawaiian Youths Abroad program initiated during the reign of King Kalākaua. A pension for the deposed Queen Lili‘uokalani and appropriation to repair the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii were also proposed. They promoted the use and study of the Hawaiian language, especially in the government and courts. Ignoring the Organic Act which mandated the sole use of English in the legislature, this session was conducted in both Hawaiian and English with the aid of an interpreter. Many of the territorial legislators in this session did not speak English. They also created the first county bill, which would have created five counties named after former Hawaiian aliʻi.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, after {{protracted}} negotiations, the recovered <b>bills</b> <b>were</b> divided equally between Ingram and Northwest Orient's insurer; the FBI retained 14 examples as evidence. Ingram sold {{fifteen of}} his bills at auction in 2008 for about $37,000. To date, {{none of the}} 9,710 remaining bills have turned up anywhere in the world.

5|$|In early 1973, {{with the}} ransom money still missing, The Oregon Journal republished the serial numbers and offered $1,000 {{to the first}} person to turn in a ransom bill to the {{newspaper}} or any FBI field office. In Seattle, the Post-Intelligencer made a similar offer with a $5,000 reward. The offers remained in effect until Thanksgiving 1974, and though there were several near-matches, no genuine <b>bills</b> <b>were</b> found. In 1975 Northwest Orient's insurer, Global Indemnity Co., complied with an order from the Minnesota Supreme Court and paid the airline's $180,000 claim on the ransom money.|$|E
