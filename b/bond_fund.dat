2500|$|In 1997, voters {{approved}} a municipal bond of $170 million, the largest bond package {{that the district}} has ever proposed. [...] The package included nearly $50 million for technology alone, allowed major renovations at nearly all campuses, and funded {{the construction of the}} Pat May Center administration building.

The Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana Regional Council of Governments initiated the project's design phase, while the City of Cincinnati led construction efforts.

40|$|One {{explanation}} for the unusually slow growth of M 2 is that people shifted from bank deposits to higher yielding <b>bond</b> mutual <b>funds.</b> This possibility {{raises the question of}} whether the addition of <b>bond</b> <b>funds</b> to M 2 would give policymakers a more accurate view of what is happening in the economy. To find the answer, I review why the money supply has been used as an indicator of nominal gross domestic product, explain why declines in bank competitiveness have led to episodes of missing money and describe <b>bond</b> <b>funds.</b> This discussion provides a basis for examining results from modeling M 2 with and without <b>bond</b> <b>funds.</b> The major policy implication of this research is that a measure of M 2 that includes <b>bond</b> <b>funds</b> should be monitored.

40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis and following bond buyback actions and quantitative easing announcements by the ECB {{have led to}} strong demand for fixed income investments, particularly in Europe. This has increased demand for both active and passive fixed income funds. In this thesis, I review the Markit EUR Corporate Index, iShares (a passive index tracker fund) and several actively managed European investment grade-focused commercial <b>bond</b> <b>funds.</b> I propose new custom <b>bond</b> <b>funds</b> based on quantitative strategies using the bond constituents of Markit iBoxx index. I then compare the performance of these custom <b>bond</b> <b>funds</b> with the benchmark Markit EUR Corporate index, the passive tracker fund and the active <b>bond</b> <b>funds.</b> I highlight the strength of simple strategies which often perform at least {{as well as the}} index and the active <b>bond</b> <b>funds.</b> by Vineet Khattar.

25|$|Ultrashort <b>bond</b> <b>funds</b> are mutual funds, {{similar to}} money market funds, that, {{as the name}} implies, invest in bonds with {{extremely}} short maturities. Unlike money market funds, however, there are no restrictions {{on the quality of}} the investments they hold. Instead, ultrashort <b>bond</b> <b>funds</b> typically invest in riskier securities in order to increase their return. Since these high-risk securities can experience large swings in price or even default, ultrashort <b>bond</b> <b>funds,</b> unlike money market funds, do not seek to maintain a stable $1.00 NAV and may lose money or dip below the $1.00 mark in the short term. Finally, because they invest in lower quality securities, ultrashort <b>bond</b> <b>funds</b> are more susceptible to adverse market conditions such as those brought on by the financial crisis of 2007–2010.|$|R

Based on a sample of 100 UCITS and 100 non UCITS funds, we find that non UCITS <b>bond</b> <b>funds</b> stochastically dominate UCITS <b>bond</b> <b>funds</b> whereas UCITS equity funds dominate non UCITS equity funds. We can infer from this result that risk–adverse investors prefer non UCITS <b>bond</b> <b>funds</b> and UCITS equity funds {{in order to maximize}} their expected utility.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} the ﬁrst investigation about <b>bond</b> mutual <b>fund</b> performance during recession and expansion periods separately.

Nevertheless, unlike equity <b>funds,</b> <b>bond</b> <b>funds</b> exhibit considerably higher alphas during good economic states than during market downturns.

In contrast, during the recession associated to the Euro sovereign debt crisis, <b>bond</b> <b>funds</b> are able to accomplish neutral performance.
