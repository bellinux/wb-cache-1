5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate {{a high school student}} who is the prime suspect in the bizarre murder of a police officer. They discover that the boy and a couple of friends have <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> the ability to accelerate their movements to a frequency the human eye can’t perceive.|$|E
5|$|Australia had injury {{concerns}} to key players {{ahead of the}} tour. Chronic knee injuries had begun to hamper medium-pacer Toshack, and he only made the trip after a 3–2 vote by a medical panel, despite {{being one of the}} first players chosen by the selectors on cricketing merit. Leading paceman Lindwall had <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> an injured leg tendon. In addition, his foot drag during the delivery stride led to speculation about the legality of his bowling action. The injury was worked on ahead of the tour, while Bradman advised Lindwall on how to rectify any suspicion over his bowling action. The Australian captain advised his bowler to ensure that his foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled, and to operate below full speed until the umpires were satisfied. Bradman's counsel was effective, as Lindwall did not have a no-ball problem during the tour.|$|E
5|$|During the off-season, it was {{revealed}} that Kesler had <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> a shoulder injury since February 2012. Suffering from a torn labrum, he underwent surgery for the injury in May. Initially expected to have recovered by mid-November, his rehabilitation was extended for several months due to an additional wrist injury which he received surgery for in late-June. As a result, he made his 2012–13 season debut on February 15, 2013, in a 4–3 loss to the Dallas Stars. Due to the NHL lockout, which cancelled the first four months of the season, Kesler only missed 12 games. Within seven games, however, Kesler was back on the injured reserve with a broken foot. He initially sustained the injury in his first game against Dallas, but subsequent X-rays came back negative. After playing through the pain for several games, an additional CT scan revealed the fracture.|$|E

5|$|Wilco began touring {{in support}} of Ghost even before the album had been released. Multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach left the band after the {{recording}} sessions to join a theater production, so Wilco added jazz rock guitarist Nels Cline and multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone to replace him. Sansone had <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> The Autumn Defense, a side project led by bassist John Stirratt. However, the tour to support the album had to be abridged. In May 2004, Tweedy checked himself into a rehabilitation clinic in Chicago, Illinois due to chronic migraine headaches, anxiety attacks, and clinical depression. In the process of treating the ailments, Tweedy became addicted to prescription painkillers. His rehab led to the cancellation of the European stage of the tour and a delay in the album's release date. Intended for release on June 8, 2004, the album was officially released on June 22, 2004.|$|E
5|$|A bowler of express pace, Lindwall was {{a regular}} member of the Test team and had opened Australia’s attack since the {{resumption}} of cricket following World War II. During the Australian summer of 1946–47, Lindwall played in all five Tests against the touring Indian cricket team. He played a major part in Australia's 4–0 series win as the leading wicket-taker with 18 scalps {{at an average of}} 16.88, ahead of Ian Johnson and Bill Johnston who took 16 apiece at averages of 16.31 and 11.37 respectively. As a result, Lindwall was selected as part of Don Bradman's Invincibles that toured England without defeat in 1948, with the intention of leading the pace attack. There were two concerns for Lindwall in the lead-up to the tour. Lindwall had <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> an injured leg tendon and his foot drag during the delivery stride led to discussion in the media and among umpires as to its legality.|$|E
5|$|After Johnson scored {{just three}} goals {{in his first}} 24 {{appearances}} of the 2001–02 season, he fell out of favour with new manager Paul Hart, and from February to April 2002, {{in order to reduce}} the club's heavy wage bill, he was allowed to go on loan to fellow First Division clubs Sheffield Wednesday (for whom he scored twice in seven appearances) and Burnley (five goals in eight appearances). Burnley had agreed to pay £120,000 to sign Johnson on a permanent basis at the end of the season, but the transfer ultimately fell through. Upon his return to Nottingham Forest for the 2002–03 season, Johnson appeared to have found his form again that had made him such a success at Ipswich, scoring 29 goals in 47 appearances in all competitions as Nottingham Forest reached the play-offs. In February 2003, it was discovered that Johnson had <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> a torn posterior cruciate ligament, and it was expected that his recovery would rule him out for up to six weeks; however, he was able to make a speedy return and was back in action against Grimsby two weeks later.|$|E

5|$|Iginla {{continued}} {{his pursuit of}} Fleury's franchise record of 830points in 2008–09. He recorded his 800th point with a first period assist against the Chicago Blackhawks on December 19, 2008. He ended 2008 with a career high five points in a New Year's Eve game against the Edmonton Oilers. He had 14 previous four point games. In January, he {{was named to the}} 2009 NHL All-Star Game in Montreal, his fifth such selection. Representing the Western Conference, Iginla scored his first career NHL All-Star Game goal in a 12–11 shootout loss. He passed Fleury as the Flames' all-time scoring leader on March 1, 2009, by recording five points, including his 400th career goal, in an 8–6 loss to the Lightning. He finished the season with 35goals and 89points, but a disappointing playoff performance led to questions of whether he had <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> an injury. Iginla quickly denied the rumour, admitted that he had not played with the level of consistency he expected and stated that he would spend the summer focused on improving his play in 2009–10.|$|E
5|$|In December 2010, Ehrhoff {{was struck}} in the ear by a puck during a game against Anaheim. He left the contest with what was {{initially}} considered a concussion; however, he was later diagnosed with vertigo instead and missed three games. Recording new career-highs in assists (36) and points (50), he led all Canucks defencemen in scoring, while ranking seventh among League defencemen. Ehrhoff was awarded his second consecutive Babe Pratt Trophy for his regular season efforts. Having won the Presidents' Trophy {{for the first time}} in team history, the Canucks entered the 2011 playoffs with the first seed in the West. They eliminated the Chicago Blackhawks, Nashville Predators and San Jose Sharks in the first three rounds to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals {{for the first time in}} 17 years. Facing the Boston Bruins, the Canucks lost the series in seven games. While Ehrhoff led Canucks defencemen and ranked second in the League overall with 12 points (two goals and ten assists) over 23 games, he had a team-worst −13 rating. It was revealed following the Canucks' Game 7 defeat to Boston that he had <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> an injured shoulder.|$|E
5|$|When the Kings {{returned}} Schenn to the WHL in December 2010, {{it allowed}} him {{to try out for}} Canada's team at the 2011 World Junior Hockey Championships. Schenn made the team after the December selection camp, and was selected as one of the alternate captains. In Canada's preliminary round game against the Czech Republic, Schenn was named player of the game. Against Norway, Schenn tied Canada's record for goals in a single game (held by Mario Lemieux and Simon Gagne) with four. He also added an assist to finish the game with five points. In Canada's gold medal loss to Russia, Schenn scored a goal and added an assist. He recorded 18 points in the tournament, tying Canada's all-time record for a single tournament, set by Dale McCourt in 1977. After the tournament, Schenn was the tournament's top scorer, and was named to the media All-Star team for the event. The IIHF Directorate named him Best Forward and Tournament MVP. Canada's coaching staff selected him as one of the team's top three players for the tournament. At the end of the tournament, it was revealed that Schenn had <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> a separated shoulder he suffered during Canada's quarter-final victory against Switzerland.|$|E

5|$|Recovering in {{time for}} the 2010–11 season, Edler {{continued}} to improve and was on pace to record new career-highs in goals, assists and points when he suffered a back injury in January 2011. Canucks General Manager Mike Gillis told reporters that Edler had been experiencing tightness in his back at several times in the season, but an open-ice hit against Dallas Stars forward Jamie Benn during a game on 24 January might have contributed to his back problems. Edler underwent microdisectomy surgery to relieve pressure on a herniated disk and was sidelined for two-and-a-half months, returning for the second-last game of the regular season. Finishing the season with eight goals and 33 points over 51 games, he ranked second among team defencemen in scoring, behind Ehrhoff. His 24 minutes and 17 seconds of average ice time per game also led the Canucks. As the Canucks won the Presidents' Trophy {{for the first time in}} franchise history, the team entered the 2011 playoffs with the first seed in the West. Eliminating the Chicago Blackhawks, Nashville Predators and San Jose Sharks, the Canucks advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in 17 years. Facing the Boston Bruins, the team lost the series in seven games. Following their defeat, it was revealed that several Canucks players had <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> injuries, including Edler, who played Game 7 with two broken fingers. He ranked second among Canucks defensemen and third in the League overall with 11 points (2 goals and 9 assists) in 25 games.|$|E
5|$|With the Panthers out of playoff {{contention}} {{late in the}} season, {{the team}} began trading away numerous veterans and core players. At the NHL trade deadline, on February 28, 2011, Higgins was dealt to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for defensive prospect Evan Oberg and a third-round draft pick in 2013. The Canucks had reportedly been interested in a different Panthers player, but with a minute left until the trade deadline, Panthers Assistant General Manager Mike Santos called the Canucks back and offered Higgins. In 48 games with the Panthers, he had recorded 11 goals and 23 points. Injured with a hand injury {{at the time of}} the trade, he did not debut with the Canucks until March 10. He scored his first two goals as a Canuck on March 27 in a 4–1 win against the Columbus Blue Jackets. He completed the season with 13 goals and 28 points in 62 games between Florida and Vancouver. While Higgins played the majority of the regular season with the Canucks as a bottom-six forward, by the playoffs, he was playing on the second line centered by Ryan Kesler. Entering the post-season as the Presidents' Trophy champions, the Canucks held the first seed in the West. After eliminating the Chicago Blackhawks, Nashville Predators and San Jose Sharks in the first three rounds, the Canucks advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals. Facing the Boston Bruins, the series went to a seventh game, which the Canucks lost 4–0. Following the Canucks' defeat, it was revealed that several Canucks players had <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> injuries, including Higgins. His injury occurred in the second round against the Predators, when he blocked a shot with his skate, breaking his foot. Over 25 playoff games, Higgins recorded four goals and eight points. Three of his goals were game-winners, tying him with Geoff Courtnall (1994) for the most in a single playoff season by a Canucks player.|$|E

25|$|Around {{the same}} time it was noted that Genie took {{pleasure}} in intentionally dropping or destroying small objects, and enjoyed watching someone else do the same to something she had <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with.</b> Kent wrote that she did the same series of actions several times over and that it appeared to ease some internal tension for her, and therefore thought she did this to gain control of traumatic childhood experiences. She also showed deep fascination with classical piano music played in front of her, which researchers believed was because she could hear some piano music during her childhood. She did not have the same reaction to recordings, and if someone played anything other than classical music she would change the sheet music to a book which she knew had pieces she liked.|$|E

50|$|To {{investigate}} {{the function of}} social emotions in economic behaviors, researchers {{are interested in the}} differences in brain regions involved when participants <b>are</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with,</b> or think that they <b>are</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with,</b> another person as opposed to a computer. A study with fMRI found that, for participants who tend to cooperate on two-person “trust and reciprocity” games, believing that they <b>are</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> another participant activated the prefrontal cortex, while believing that they <b>are</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> a computer did not. This difference was not seen with players who tend not to cooperate. The authors interpret this difference as theory of minds that cooperators employ to anticipate the opponents' strategies. This {{is an example of the}} way social decision making differs from other forms of decision making.|$|R
