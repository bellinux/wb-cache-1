5|$|Although <b>brine</b> shrimp can {{be found}} in the arm of the lake north of the causeway, studies {{conducted}} by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources indicate that these are likely transient. Populations of <b>brine</b> shrimp are mostly restricted to the lake's south arm.|$|E
5|$|In road {{snow and}} ice control, <b>brine</b> is often used as an anti-icer rather than a de-icer. A vehicle carries a tank of <b>brine,</b> which is sprayed on the road surface before or {{at the onset of}} the storm. This keeps {{snow and ice}} from {{adhering}} to the surface and makes mechanical removal by plows easier. Solid salt is also wetted with <b>brine</b> or other liquid deicer. This speeds de-icing action and helps keep it from bouncing off the pavement into the gutter or ditch. <b>Brine</b> acts faster than solid salt and does not require compression by passing traffic to become effective. The <b>brine</b> is also more environmentally friendly, as less salt is required to treat the same length of road.|$|E
50|$|Many {{varieties}} of <b>brined</b> cheeses are produced. Varieties of <b>brined</b> cheese include feta, halloumi, sirene and telemea, {{a variant of}} brinza. <b>Brined</b> cheese is the main type of cheese produced and eaten in the Middle East and Mediterranean areas.|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that oil field <b>brines</b> can become ore-forming solutions and can transport base metals and reduced sulfur to sites of ore formation by large-scale migration along aquifers out of sedimentary basins is examined using {{data on the}} chemical compositions of present-day heavy metal-bearing oil field <b>brines</b> and the petrography of their reservoir ocks, and is a theoretical evaluation of the chemistry of possible water-rock interactions in the aquifers during migration. Analyses of oil field <b>brines</b> from the Pleasant Bayou in the upper Texas Gulf Coast and the Bayleigh field in central Mississippi were {{used to calculate the}} pH of the <b>brines</b> under reservoir conditions by assuming equilibrium with the reservoir mineral assemblages. The calculated pH values are less than 5. 7 for the Pleasant Bayou <b>brines</b> at 188 øC and 787 bars and 4. 8 (_+ 0. 8) for the Bayleigh field <b>brines</b> at 180 øC and 890 bars. According to theoretical and experimental evidence of metal sulfide solubilities, <b>brines</b> with pH's as low as the Bayleigh field <b>brines</b> could contain parts per million quantities of zinc, lead, and reduced sulfur under reservoir conditions.

5|$|Lithium salts {{have to be}} {{extracted}} from the water of mineral springs, <b>brine</b> pools, and <b>brine</b> deposits. The metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused lithium chloride and potassium chloride.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} arm of {{the lake}} has a much higher salinity, {{to the point that}} the native <b>brine</b> shrimp cannot survive in its waters. In the southern portion, where the vast majority of the fresh water inlets are found, the salt level can dip below what is necessary for the <b>brine</b> shrimp to survive, while water in the northern bay is too salty. The salinity of northern {{arm of the}} lake will likely drop as lower salinity from the southern arm of the lake flows into the northern arm. The <b>brine</b> shrimp harvesting industry could benefit from the causeway allowing a freer flow of water. There were concerns from the <b>brine</b> shrimp harvesting industry that the lake conditions in the southern arm of the lake were becoming too saline for the <b>brine</b> shrimp due to several years of lower precipitation in the lake's watershed. The precipitation in the watershed has been above normal for the current water year that begins its tracking October 1, 2016. This additional precipitation has allowed the levels of both arms of the lake to rise, and at least for the near future the conditions for a healthy <b>brine</b> shrimp population seem good.|$|E
5|$|In {{diaphragm}} cell electrolysis, an asbestos (or polymer-fiber) diaphragm separates a cathode and an anode, {{preventing the}} chlorine forming at the anode from re-mixing with the sodium hydroxide and the hydrogen formed at the cathode. The salt solution (<b>brine)</b> is continuously fed to the anode compartment and {{flows through the}} diaphragm to the cathode compartment, where the caustic alkali is produced and the <b>brine</b> is partially depleted. Diaphragm methods produce dilute and slightly impure alkali, {{but they are not}} burdened with the problem of mercury disposal and they are more energy efficient.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of grilling and <b>brining</b> on the sensory properties, the fillet fatty acid composition and the cardio-protective activity of sardine (Sardina pilchardus), studying the in vitro activity against Platelet-Activating-Factor (PAF) induced platelet aggregation. Sensory evaluation of grilled and <b>brined</b> sardine showed that grilled sardine had higher scores for the attributes: grilled fish, marine and fresh fish whereas <b>brined</b> sardine had higher scores for the attributes: salty, iodine, oily and bitter. Grilled sardine exhibited significantly increased fillet fatty acid content while the <b>brined</b> fish sample significantly decreased fatty acid levels. Polar lipids of all specimens (raw, grilled and <b>brined)</b> showed strong inhibitory activity against PAF action indicating that grilling and <b>brining</b> have not diminished the cardio-protective properties of sardine. </p...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{measurements}} of liquid-vapor partitioning (volatility) of chlorides from <b>brines</b> to steam {{can be used}} to indicate the potential for corrosion problems in geothermal systems. Measurements of volatilities of solutes in chloride <b>brines</b> have established a possible mechanism for the production of high-chloride steam from slightly acidic high temperature <b>brines.</b> Questions concerning the fate of NaCl in the steam production process have been addressed through extensive {{measurements of}} its volatility from <b>brines</b> ranging in concentration from dilute solutions to halite saturation. Recent measurements of chloride partitioning to steam over <b>brines</b> in contact with Geysers rock samples are consistent with our concept of the process for production of high-chloride steam...|$|R
5|$|The high {{salinity}} {{in parts}} of the lake makes them uninhabitable for all but a few species, including <b>brine</b> shrimp, <b>brine</b> flies, and several forms of algae. The <b>brine</b> flies have an estimated population of over one hundred billion and serve as the main source of food for many of the birds which migrate to the lake. However, the fresh- and salt-water wetlands along the eastern and northern edges of the Great Salt Lake provide critical habitat for millions of migratory shorebirds and waterfowl in western North America. These marshes account for approximately 75% of the wetlands in Utah. Some of the birds that depend on these marshes include: Wilson's phalarope, red-necked phalarope, American avocet, black-necked stilt, marbled godwit, snowy plover, western sandpiper, long-billed dowitcher, tundra swan, American white pelican, white-faced ibis, California gull, eared grebe, peregrine falcon, bald eagle, plus large populations of various ducks and geese.|$|E
5|$|This grebe eats mostly insects, of both {{adult and}} larval stages, {{as well as}} crustaceans, molluscs, tadpoles, and small frogs and fish. When {{moulting}} at lakes with high salinity, although, this bird feeds mostly on <b>brine</b> shrimp. The behaviour of black-necked grebes changes {{in response to the}} availability of <b>brine</b> shrimp; bodies of water with more shrimp have more grebes, and grebes spend more time foraging when the amount of shrimp and the water temperature decreases.|$|E
5|$|Gas lighting: The ancient Chinese {{during the}} Spring and Autumn period {{made the first}} {{practical}} use of natural gas for lighting purposes around 500 B.C. where they used bamboo pipelines to transport and carry both <b>brine</b> and natural gas for many miles.|$|E
40|$|Sedimentary basins {{can contain}} close to 20 % by volume pore fluids that are {{commonly}} classified as <b>brines.</b> These fluids can become undersaturated {{with respect to}} calcite {{as a result of}} processes such as migration, dispersive mixing, or anthropogenic injection of CO 2. This study measured calcite solubility and dissolution rates in geologically relevant Na-Ca-Mg-Cl synthetic <b>brines</b> (35 to 200 g L- 1 TDS).

40|$|Changes in oil {{exudation}} and histological {{structures of}} salted duck egg yolks during <b>brining</b> up to 5 wk were investigated. During <b>brining,</b> the salt contents of albumen, exterior yolk (hardened portion), and interior yolk (soft or liquid portion) gradually increased accompanied by slight decreases in moisture content. The hardening ratio of salted egg yolks increased rapidly to about 60 % {{during the first}} week of <b>brining</b> and then reached 100 % at the end of <b>brining.</b> After <b>brining,</b> part of the lipids in salted egg yolk became free due to the structural changes of low-density lipoprotein induced by dehydration and increase of salt content, and more free lipids in salted egg yolk were released after the cooking process. With the <b>brining</b> time increased up to 5 wk, the outer region of the cooked salted yolk gradually changed into dark brown, brown, orange, and then dark brown, whereas the center region changed into light yellow, yellow, dark yellow, and then yellow again. The microstructures of cooked salted egg yolks showed that the yolk spheres in the outer and middle regions retained their original shape, with some shrinking and being packed more loosely when <b>brining</b> time increased, and the exuded oil filled the space between the spheres. Furthermore, the yolk spheres in the center region transformed to a round shape but still showed granulation after 4 wk of <b>brining,</b> whereas they were mostly disrupted after 2 to 5 wk of <b>brining.</b> One of the most important characteristics of cooked salted egg yolks, gritty texture, contributed to oil exudation and granulated yolk spheres were observed at the <b>brining</b> time of 4 wk...|$|R
40|$|Interest in <b>brines</b> {{in extreme}} and cold environments has {{recently}} increased {{after they have}} been found on Mars. Those <b>brines</b> can be potential new subsurface habitats for peculiar ecosystems. In the McMurdo Dry Valleys of the Antarctic, the best analogue for Mars conditions, only a few cases of <b>brines</b> have been identified in some perennially frozen lakes and in one case in an underground aquifer. Here, we present the occurrence of pressurized <b>brines</b> in a shallow perennially ice-covered lake south of 70 °S in an ice-free area of Victoria Land, Antarctica. For the first time, we also imaged, by means of ground penetrating radar data, the existence of a pingo-like-feature (PLF) formed by the extrusion of <b>brines,</b> which has also been confirmed by borehole evidence. Those <b>brines</b> are fed by an underground talik external to the lake basin, enhancing the possibility of unexploited ecosystems that could find an analogue in Martian environments...|$|R

50|$|Some near-surface <b>brines</b> in {{the western}} United States contain anomalously high {{concentrations}} of dissolved tungsten. Should recovery ever prove economic, some <b>brines</b> could be significant sources of tungsten. For instance, <b>brines</b> beneath Searles Lake, California, with concentrations of about 56 mg/l tungsten (70 mg/l WO3), contain about 8.5 million short tons of tungsten. Although 90% of the dissolved tungsten is technically recoverable by ion exchange resins, recovery is uneconomic.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{investigated}} and compared the fermentation characteristics of intact kimchi and <b>brined</b> baechu cabbage and seasoning fermented separately. Fermentation characteristics of kimchi, <b>brined</b> baechu cabbage and season-ing, such as pH, acidity, microbial counts, and springiness were measured during the fermentation period (4 weeks at 4 °C).

5|$|The main {{deposits}} of lithium {{are found in}} China and throughout the Andes mountain chain in South America.

5|$|Worldwide {{identified}} {{reserves in}} 2008 were {{estimated by the}} US Geological Survey (USGS) to be 13 million tonnes, though an accurate estimate of world lithium reserves is difficult. One {{reason for this is}} that most lithium classification schemes are developed for solid ore deposits, whereas <b>brine</b> is a fluid that is problematic to treat with the same classification scheme due to varying concentrations and pumping effects. The world has been estimated to contain about 15 million tonnes of lithium reserves, while 65 million tonnes of known resources are reasonable. A total of 75% of everything can typically be found in the ten largest deposits of the world. Another study noted that 83% of the geological resources of lithium are located in six <b>brine,</b> two pegmatite, and two sedimentary deposits.|$|E
