Paper {{is one of the}} main products that arise from the forest industry. However, the industry is facing challenges, the demand for paper is declining, both domestically and internationally. The lower growth means that companies are being forced to make strategically changes in their operative work. The Swedish paper production and export has decreased due to shutting down of machines in the paper mills as an effect of today’s market. There are outer factors that have an effect on the industry such as increasing propulsion costs for the sea leg as a result of the implementation of the new Sulphur Emission Control Area regulations, SECA. Stora Enso, one of the major companies in the forest industry has just recently changed from Gothenburg as their main port (base port) to Zeebrügge (4 S). This report investigates the strategically benefits that strives the company to make such changes.

40|$|The {{strategy}} of Niigata prefecture concerning the international logistics : A design of new Land Bridge using TSR(Tans-Siberian Railway) across the Japanese Sea The new {{trend in the}} North East Asia especially in the Korean peninsula {{and the development of}} the market mechanism in Russia especially in the field of Russian automotive market are improving circumstances surrounding the international logistics in the Japan Sea. Then Niigata prefecture is facing the chance in which {{it will be able to}} promote new Land Bridge using TSR(Trans-Siberian Railway) across the Japan Sea. I will propose some issues related to new Land Bridge in this article. First issue is the revival of the regular container ship service between Port Niigata and Port Vostochny to promote the delivery of automotive parts from Japan to Russia which will be manufactured in Japanese automotive factories and will be assembled in Russia especially in Saint Petersburg where Japanese automotive assemblers have already advance. Second issue is the utilization of TSR to promote of the entrance of Japanese companies into the development of Siberia and Far East districts where Russian government intends to invest much money not only in the field of manufacturing but also in the field of energy and natural resources. Third issue is collaboration among Japanese districts consisting of Kyushu district. Hokkaido district and Tohoku district owing to the coordinating by Niigata district for the purpose to create the “Axis of Japan Sea” Forth issue is the creation of new cluster named 「Kan-Etu cluster」 between Niigata cluster which is typical metal-processing cluster and North kanto cluster which is typical automotive cluster for the purpose to provide <b>Base</b> <b>Cargo</b> being necessary to support container ship service between Port Niigata and Port Vostochny...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{concentrate}} on the service structure of ground-transportation <b>based</b> <b>cargo</b> delivery companies. The transient times that arise from nonsimultaneous arrivals at hubs (typically spent for unloading, loading, and sorting operations) can constitute {{a significant portion of}} the total delivery time for cargo delivery systems. The latest arrival hub location problem is a new minimax model that focuses on the minimization of the arrival time of the last item to arrive, taking into account journey times as well as the transient times at hubs. We first focus on a typical cargo delivery firm operating in Turkey and observe that stopovers are essential components of a ground-based cargo delivery system. The existing formulations of the hub location problem in the literature do not allow stopovers since they assume direct connections between demand centers and hubs. In this paper, we propose a generic mathematical model, which allows stopovers for the latest arrival hub location problem. We improve the model using valid inequalities and lifting.

40|$|Part I. Photocages, {{which are}} light cleavable {{protecting}} groups, {{are an important}} class of chemical tools that allow light to unmask bioactive substrates with precise spatiotemporal resolution in biological microenvironments. Due to their effectiveness in biological systems, {{it has become increasingly}} important to find logically designed photocages that can cleave under visible light and Near IR conditions, wavelengths with minimal phototoxicity and increased tissue penetration compared to ultraviolet light. The scope of this research is to both rationally design and synthesize a new class of photocage based on the BODIPY moiety, as well as to modify these photocages to absorb in region of the biological window (600 - 1000 nm), where tissues have maximal transparency. In chapter 1, photocages derived from meso-substituted BODIPY dyes were synthesized that release acetic acid when irradiated with green wavelengths (3 ̆e 500 nm). The structures of the photocages were derived by computationally searching for carbocations with low-energy diradical states as a possible indicator of nearby productive conical intersections. These photocages were found to have superior optical properties than the popular o-nitrobenzyl systems, which make them promising alternatives. The utility of these photocages in living cells was successfully demonstrated by our collaborators (Prof. Emily Smith and Aleem Syed) in cultured S 2 cells. In Chapter 2, Knoevenagel type reactions were used to extend the π electron conjugation of the aromatic rings of the BODIPY photocages. This extended conjugation of these BODIPY photocages resulted in a bathochromic shift in absorbance towards red light (3 ̆e 600 nm) and allows cleavage using wavelengths in the biological window. Part II. Self-immolative linkers can be used to trigger the release of an important cargo molecule like a drug or a biomolecule. A variety of trigger stimulants including light, chemo and enzyme are known in literature. However, {{there is a need for}} new linker units which would have fast and controllable kinetics of cargo release. During my research, I identified improved self-immolative linker units based on aryl phthalate esters with a modular design, which can tolerate a range of different trigger and cargo units. In Chapter 3, new types of self-immolative linkers based on the phenyl hydrogen phthalate system were synthesized. The fast kinetic rate for the hydrolysis of phenyl hydrogen phthalate system and the resulting benign byproducts promise a robust self-immolative linker system that can be used in biological systems. The linker system was shown to release phenol <b>based</b> <b>cargo</b> molecules including phenol and coumarin dyes upon cleavage by a fluoride sensitive trigger. This type of linker can also be potentially used as an efficient fluoride sensor. In Chapter 4, the scope of self-immolative linkers based on phenyl hydrogen phthalate system was extended. Light and peroxide sensitive triggers were incorporated into the linker system. Coumarin <b>based</b> <b>cargo</b> molecules were used as reporter molecules and the increase in their fluorescence after release was monitored. The light-sensitive aryl phthalate ester was further demonstrated as a pro-fluorophore in cultured S 2 cells...|$|R
