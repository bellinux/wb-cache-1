5|$|Agouti {{species are}} one of the few animal groups that can break open the large {{capsules}} of the <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> fruit. Too many seeds are inside to be consumed in one meal, so the agouti carries some off and caches them. This helps dispersal of the seeds as any that the agouti fails to retrieve are distant from the parent tree when they germinate. Other nut-bearing trees tend to bear a glut of fruits in the autumn. These are too numerous to be eaten in one meal and squirrels gather and store the surplus in crevices and hollow trees. In desert regions, seeds are often available only for short periods. The kangaroo rat collects all it can find and stores them in larder chambers in its burrow.|$|E

25|$|In most {{monocotyledons}} (such as {{grasses and}} palms) and some (endospermic or albuminous) dicotyledons (such as castor beans) the embryo {{is embedded in}} the endosperm (and nucellus), which the seedling will use upon germination. In the non-endospermic dicotyledons the endosperm is absorbed by the embryo as the latter grows within the developing seed, and the cotyledons of the embryo become filled with stored food. At maturity, seeds of these species have no endosperm and are also referred to as exalbuminous seeds. The exalbuminous seeds include the legumes (such as beans and peas), trees such as the oak and walnut, vegetables such as squash and radish, and sunflowers. According to Bewley and Black (1978), <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> storage is in hypocotyl, this place of storage is uncommon among seeds. All gymnosperm seeds are albuminous.|$|E

60|$|Martin {{kept his}} eyes shut for only about a minute, as he thought; but {{he must have been}} asleep some time, for when he opened them the False Water had vanished, and the sun, looking very large and crimson, was just about to set. He started up, feeling very thirsty and hungry and bewildered; for he was far, far from home, and lost on the great plain. Presently he spied a man coming towards him on horseback. A very funny-looking old man he proved to be, with a face {{wrinkled}} and tanned by sun and wind, until it resembled a piece of ancient shoe-leather left lying for years on some neglected spot of ground. A <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> is not darker nor more wrinkled than was the old man's face. His long matted beard and hair had once been white, but the sun out of doors and the smoke in his smoky hut had given them a yellowish tinge, so that they looked like dry dead grass. He wore big jack-boots, patched all over, and full of cracks and holes; and a great pea-jacket, rusty and ragged, fastened with horn buttons big as saucers. His old brimless hat looked like a dilapidated tea-cosy on his head, and to prevent it from being carried off by the wind it was kept on with an old flannel shirtsleeve tied under his chin. His saddle, too, like his clothes, was old and full of rents, with wisps of hair and straw-stuffing sticking out in various places, and his feet were thrust into a pair of big stirrups made of pieces of wood and rusty iron tied together with string and wire.|$|E

40|$|Several sample {{preparation}} strategies were employed for determination and fractionation of barium in <b>Brazil</b> <b>nuts</b> using measurements by graphite furnace {{atomic absorption spectrometry}} (GF AAS) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry with axial view (ICP OES). This food is widely consumed because of its nutritional value and good taste. The chemical analysis of <b>Brazil</b> <b>nuts</b> is not trivial due to their complex matrix. The fractionation of barium in <b>Brazil</b> <b>nuts</b> was studied owing to the toxicity of this element and the strong correlation between chemical form and absorption. Total concentrations of barium varied from 860 to 2084 mg kg- 1. Sequential extractions were performed based on solubility in different media and also according to lipids, proteins and low molecular weight fractions (LMW). The greatest contents of barium were determined in the LMW and in the water insoluble fractions with concentrations in the range 778 to 1606 and 551 to 1520 mg kg- 1, respectively. Based on these results it can be inferred that Ba is not absorbed when <b>Brazil</b> <b>nuts</b> are ingested. Considering both the contents of barium and sulfur in different fractions and stoichiometric calculations it was also possible to assume that barium occurs mainly in the BaSO 4 form. The presence of this chemical form was also confirmed by thermogravimetric measurements...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe HPLC (anion exchange) ‚ÄìICP-MS {{technique}} {{was used for}} the identification (based on retention time of standards) and determination of four selenium species (selenite, selenate, selenomethionine and selenocystine) in plankton (BCR- 414), <b>Brazil</b> <b>nuts</b> and urine samples. A recovery of 91 % was attained for certified reference materials (BCR- 414). Se(IV) was the predominant species in plankton, with the highest selenium concentration in the extract. The <b>Brazil</b> <b>nuts</b> showed only the organic species selenomethionine and selenocystine after water extraction, but after simulated gastrointestinal digestion, only selenomethionine was found as bioaccessible, corresponding to 74 % of the total selenium (54. 8 ¬± 4. 6 Œºgg‚àí 1).

50|$|In a {{study to}} {{identify}} which insects pollinated the flowers of the <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> tree (Bertholletia excelsa), {{it was found that}} the flowers were visited by a number of bee species, including E. meriana, which visited the tree early in the day. Both males and females were observed collecting nectar from the base of the flower's lower lip. The study concluded that E. meriana played a part in the pollination of the <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> flowers but that other bee species, Eulaema mocsaryi and Xylocopa frontalis, were of greater importance, thus E. meriana are not required to pollinate <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> flowers. Nevertheless, in commercial <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> tree plantations, successful pollination depends on the plantation being surrounded by intact primary forest with its epiphytic orchid population to supply a sufficient number of pollinating bees for the large number of flowers.|$|E
