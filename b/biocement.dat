40|$|Abstract—The {{invention}} of microorganism’s involvement in carbonate precipitation, has lead {{the exploration of}} this process {{in the field of}} construction engineering. <b>Biocement</b> is a product innovation from developing bioprocess technology called biocementation. <b>Biocement</b> refers to CaCO 3 deposit that formed due to microorganism activity in the system rich of calcium ion. The primary role of microorganism in carbonate precipitation is mainly due to their ability to create an alkaline environment (high pH and DIC increase) through their various physiological activities. Three main groups of microorganism that can induce the carbonate precipitation: (i) photosynthetic microorganism such as cyanobacteria and microalgae; (ii) sulphate reducing bacteria; and (iii) some species of microorganism involved in nitrogen cycle. Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganism and utilize urea using urease or urea amidolyase enzyme, based on {{that it is possible to}} use microalgae as media to produce <b>biocement</b> through biocementation. This paper overviews <b>biocement</b> in general, biocementation, type of microorganism and their pathways in inducing carbonate precipitation and the prospect of microalgae to be used in <b>biocement</b> production.

This cost can be greatly reduced if waste materials from the mining and biofuel industries {{can be used to}} substitute conventional materials for road repair or construction. The objective of this project is to develop methods to produce a new construction material, <b>biocement,</b> using waste products and apply the new material for road repair and construction. Two types of waste were used in this study. One is limestone fines produced from a limestone mine in Iowa. Another is organic acids, a byproduct produced from a pyrolysis-based biofuel manufacturing process. The limestone fines and organic acids can be used to produce <b>biocement</b> under ambient temperature in an inexpensive way. The cost-effective <b>biocement</b> {{can be used as a}} substitute for expensive cement for road repairs and construction. <b>Biocement</b> grout, or biogrout, can be injected directly into cavities or cracks in pavement for road repair. As the viscosity of biogrout is low, biogrout can penetrate better into the road pavement than cement grout. Biocement-mixed aggregate can be used for road base or subbase construction. <b>Biocement</b> solutions can also be applied directly on shoulders as a stabilizer or on unpaved roads as a dust control agent. The focus of this project is on the development of cost-effective <b>biocement</b> products and their effectiveness for road repair.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a small-scale demonstration of an ex situ mixing technique that uses biocementation {{as an alternative}} to existing ground improvement techniques. The main objective of this research is to improve the strength and the stiffness of loose sand. <b>Biocemented</b> sand specimens have been produced by mixing a urease producing bacteria with nutrients and Sydney sand. Triaxial test with bender elements and the physical model test are conducted to investigate calcium carbonate precipitation and the properties of the soil.

40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} <b>biocements</b> {{based on}} calcium phosphate chemistry are well-established biomaterials for the repair of non-load bearing bone defects {{due to the}} brittle nature and low flexural strength of such cements. This article features reinforcement strategies of <b>biocements</b> based on various intrinsic or extrinsic material modifications to improve their strength and toughness. Altering particle size distribution in conjunction with using liquefiers reduces the amount of cement liquid necessary for cement paste preparation. This in turn decreases cement porosity and increases the mechanical performance, but {{does not change the}} brittle nature of the cements. The use of fibers may lead to a reinforcement of the matrix with a toughness increase of up to two orders of magnitude, but restricts at the same time cement injection for minimal invasive application techniques. A novel promising approach is the concept of dual-setting cements, in which a second hydrogel phase is simultaneously formed during setting, leading to more ductile cement–hydrogel composites with largely unaffected application properties...|$|R

In the present study, we {{have examined the}} effects of three biocements, <b>biocement</b> H, calcium-deficient apatite; <b>biocement</b> F, apatite + CaHPO(4); <b>biocement</b> D, carbonated apatite + CaHPO(4) + CaCO(3) and an amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) proposed as implant fixing materials, on the growth, differentiation, and cell surface interaction of human bone marrow fibroblastic cells. These cells are known to be progenitors of osteoblasts, chondroblasts, adipocytes, myoblasts, and reticulocytes. Alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity, a marker of the osteoblast phenotype, was increased by a factor of two- to sixfold on carbonated apatite, one- to sixfold on apatite and three- to 10 -fold on calcium-deficient apatite, over levels observed on plastic. Cell proliferation was significantly reduced. Photomicroscopic examination indicated high biocompatibility with close adhesion of the bone marrow fibroblastic cells to composites D, F, and H. Longer term marrow cultures (15 days) confirmed the stimulation of cell differentiation, as assessed by collagen production, over cell proliferation, of cells grown on carbonated apatite. Enhanced osteoblastic differentiation was observed on a 70 % carbonated apatite, which has a composition similar to bone mineral, whereas cell toxicity was observed on cells grown on amorphous calcium phosphate. This in vitro human bone marrow fibroblast culture system provides a simple and effective method for the evaluation of new biomaterials.

40|$|Abstract. The present world {{cannot be}} {{imagined}} without construction industry. On other hand {{we are not}} able to prevent impact of construction on the environment due to usage of its key component that is cement, which plays a greater role in the emission of greenhouse gases. Every tonne of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) that is produced releases on average a similar amount of CO 2 into the atmosphere, or in total roughly 6 % of all man-made carbon emissions. One of the purposes of research should be to lower the amount of cement during construction without compromising the quality of building structure. Microbial metabolic activities often contribute to selective cementation by biomineralization. In the present study, a novel microbial based low energy green building material based on microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) has been reported that is known as “biocement”. <b>Biocement</b> has enormous potential and usage in building materials and structures with potential to partially replace the cement.

40|$|A strong {{interest}} {{in the use of}} ceramics for biomedical engineering applications developed in the late 1960 ´s. Used initially as alternatives to metallic materials in order to increase the biocompatibility of implants, bioceramics have become a diverse class of biomaterials, presently including three basic types: relatively bioinert ceramics; bioactive or surface reactive bioceramics and bioresorbable ceramics. This review will only refer to bioceramics “sensus stricto”, it is to say, those ceramic materials constituted for nonmetallic inorganic compounds, crystallines and consolidated by thermal treatments of powders to high temperatures. Leaving bioglasses, glass-ceramics and <b>biocements</b> apart, since, although all of them are obtained by thermal treatments to high temperatures, the first are amorphous, the second are obtained by desvitrification of a glass and in them vitreous phase normally prevails on the crystalline phases and the third are consolidated by means of a hydraulic or chemical reaction to room temperature.

40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} <b>biocements</b> {{are inherently}} brittle materials {{due to their}} ceramic nature. Hence, currently applied cement formulations are only indicated for non-load bearing application sites. An approach to reduce cement brittleness {{is based on the}} use of cement – polymer composites, which combine the flexibility of a polymeric phase with the hardness and compression strength of a cement matrix. Here, a relatively new strategy is the use of “dual-setting” cements, in which the polymeric phase is simultaneously build up from monomers or prepolymers during cement setting. This approach largely maintains basic properties of the fresh paste such as rheology or setting time. Previous works on such dual setting cements were dealing with a radical polymerization reaction to create the polymeric network. This type of reaction requires the addition of a suitable initiator system (e. g. a tertiary amine in conjunction with ammonium peroxosulfate), which are often cytotoxic and may interfere with the cement setting conditions. The current thesis dealt with alternative strategies, in which the cross-linking and gelation of the second (polymeric or inorganic) cement phase is initiated by the chemical conditions of the setting reaction such that no additional initiator has {{to be added to the}} cement paste. In a first approach a six armed star molecule functionalized with isocyanate groups as reactive termini (NCO–sP(EO-stat-PO)) was used to build up a hydrogel matrix, which was then subsequently mineralized with hydroxyapatite nanocrystals following the hydrolysis of incorporated -tricalcium phosphate particles. The stimulus to initiate hydrogel cross-linking are water molecules, which subsequently hydrolyzed isocyanate groups to amines, which then cross-linked with unreacted isocyanate to form urea-bonds. Here, it was possible to show the advantages features of a dual setting system in comparison to the simple combination of hydrogels with unreactive filler particles. By the formation of the cement matrix within the hydrogel a strength improvement by the factor of 30 could be observed. Furthermore, by applying a dual setting system higher mineral concentrations are realizable. The mechanical properties such as elasticity, compression strength and E-modulus of a composite with 30 wt...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{non-stoichiometry}} and isomorphic substitutions on {{the properties of}} some apatite-type compounds were investigated. These investigations were performed both {{in the fields of}} Portland cement chemistry and apatitic calcium phosphate-based <b>biocements.</b> Apatite compounds were synthesized by solid state methods and by hydrolysis of the reactant α-tricalcium phosphate (α-TCP). The materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Apatite-type chlorellestadite is a compound found in cement kiln deposits. Its formation in the inlet part of the kiln obstructs the feed flow and was found to be an indication of the presence of high HCl(g) concentrations, principal cause of corrosion in the kiln lining. In order to quantify, by XRD analysis, the chlorellestadite phase in the coating samples, a good starting model of the crystal structure had to be chosen. For that purpose, many synthetic chlorellestadites were prepared varying the experimental conditions, and their crystal structure refined using the Rietveld method. At the same time, the range of thermal stability of nonstoichiometric chlorellestadite was determined providing {{a better understanding of the}} chemistry of silicate sulphate chloride-apatites. Biological hydroxyapatite is the main inorganic compound present in bones and teeth in all vertebrates. Synthetic hydroxyapatite with chemical composition and crystal structure similar to biological apatite represent therefore a suitable biocompatible material for orthopaedic applications. Calcium deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA) was prepared by mixing, at room and body temperature, an α-TCP powder with a 2. 5 wt% Na 2 HPO 4 accelerating solution. The resulting paste hardens forming CDHA as hydration product. Incorporation in the cement of Sr and Si, elements present as traces in bones, was achieved by hydrolysis of Sr-, Si-substituted α-TCP. The effect of substitutions on the hydraulic and mechanical properties of the cement pastes was monitored by isothermal calorimetry, XRD, SEM, and compressive strength testing. The bioactivity of the set cements was investigated by examination with SEM of the new apatite layer formed on the surface of the cement samples, after 4 weeks soaking in simulated body fluid...|$|R

40|$|Magnesium calcium {{phosphate}} <b>biocement</b> (MCPB) with rapid-setting characteristics was fabricated {{by using the}} mixed powders of magnesium oxide (MgO) and calcium dihydrogen phosphate (Ca(H 2 PO 4) 2 ·H 2 O). The results revealed that the MCPB hardened after mixing the powders with water for about 7 min, and the compressive strength reached 43 MPa after setting for 1 h, indicating that the MCPB had a short setting time and high initial mechanical strength. After the acid–base reaction of MCPB containing MgO and Ca(H 2 PO 4) 2 ·H 2 O in a molar ratio of 2 : 1, the final hydrated products were Mg 3 (PO 4) 2 and Ca 3 (PO 4) 2. The MCPB was degradable in Tris–HCl solution and the degradation ratio was obviously higher than {{calcium phosphate}} <b>biocement</b> (CPB) because of its fast dissolution. The attachment and proliferation of the MG 63 cells on the MCPB were significantly enhanced in comparison with CPB, and the alkaline phosphatase activity of MG 63 cells on the MCPB {{was significantly higher than}} on the CPB at 7 and 14 days.

40|$|<b>Biocements</b> {{made from}} β-TCP - H 3 PO 4 - H 2 O and β-TCP - MCPM - H 2 O {{mixtures}} were studied {{in order to}} obtain a better control of their setting time and mechanical strength (β-TCP = Ca 3 (PO 4) 2; MCPM = Ca(H 2 PO 4) 2. H 2 O). The effects of factors like the purity of the β-TCP powder, its particle size distribution, the carnet composition or the presence of additives were investigated. More fundamental studies were also done on the reactions controlling the setting time, i. e. β-TP dissolution and DCPD (CaHPO 4. 2 H 2 O) precipitation. The influence of additives on the kinetics of these controlling reactions were studied in order to establish how they influenced the setting time. To complete these experiments, cements made from β-TCP - MCPM - CSH - H 2 O mixtures were implanted in rabbit tibias (CSH = CaSO 4. l/ 2 H 2 O). The aging behavior in vivo and in vitro were compared. Results show that many factors affect the physico-chemical properties of the cements, particularly setting time and tensile strength. However, these factors have only a very limited number of pathways in which they can act. For example, setting time can only change when either β-TCP dissolution rate, DCPD germination rate or interparticular free volume are modified. Tensile strength only depends on DCPD weight fraction (binder for β-TCP powder), porosity and microstructure. Sulfate, pyrophosphate and citrate ions delay the cement's setting time in the following order: sulfate < citrate < pyrophosphate. These three ions inhibit DCPD crystal growth in the same order. Therefore, these results suggest that all the ions which inhibit DCPD crystal growth are potential setting time delaying additives. The concentration range in which sulfate ions act on setting time is limited between 0 and 0. 1 M; beyond this concentration sulfate ions precipitate as CSD (CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O). As DCPD and CSD structures are nearly identical, the presence of CSD crystals speeds up the setting reaction by acting as seeds for DCPD crystals. This phenomenon provokes a decrease in the setting time and a refinement of the microstructure with a consequent increase in the tensile strength. Accurate control of the cement composition is very important, i. e. volume and concentration of the phosphoric acid solution. Results show that an excess of phosphoric acid provokes the recrystallization of DCPD into DCP, a process which strongly decreases tensile strength. A modification of the microstructure is also observed when initial β-TCP specific surface area is changed. An increase in the surface area gives an increase in the tensile strength and a decrease in the setting time. In our experiments, a fivefold increase of specific surface area decreases the setting time by a factor of three and doubles the tensile strength. These results show that β-TCP particle size distribution has a very strong effect on the physico-chemical properties of our cements. The comparison between in vitro and in vivo tests prove that in vivo results cannot be anticipated by in vitro experiments. However, in vivo results are extremely positive: our cement is biocompatible, bioresorbable and osteoconductive. These results show that after one month, our cements are closely bonded to living bone, and after four months, our cements are nearly completely resorbed and replaced by new bone (except for dense and large β-TCP particles) ...|$|R

30|$|Calcite {{precipitation}} {{is influenced}} by pH, because the urease enzyme will only be active at pH values specific for urea hydrolysis. Many investigators have reported that the optimum pH for urease is 8.0, above which the enzyme activity decreases (Stocks-Fischer et al. 1999; Gorospe et al. 2013). A high pH {{is very important for}} ammonia production by urea hydrolysis. Aerobic bacteria release CO 2 via cell respiration, which is paralleled by an increase in pH due to ammonia production (Ng et al. 2012). If the pH levels become low, the carbonate will tend to dissolve rather than precipitate (Loewenthal and Marais 1978). Most calcite precipitation occurs under alkaline conditions from pH 8.7 to 9.5 (Stocks-Fischer et al. 1999; Ferris et al. 2003; Dupraz et al. 2009), but Mobley et al. (1995) found that the acid urease and optimum pH were nearly neutral. Stabnikov et al.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of using microbiological processes {{to improve the}} mechanical properties of soil by undisturbed in-situ application has gained attention over recent years. This study {{has contributed to the}} technology of <b>biocement,</b> based on microbially induced carbonate precipitation (MICP), for the purpose of soil reinforcement application. MICP involves both the hydrolysis of urea by bacterial urease enzyme and calcium carbonate precipitation in the presence of dissolved calcium ions. Other previously published approaches were based on saturated flow (submersed flow), which is accomplished by pumping solutions from an injection point to a recovery point which is limited exclusively to water saturated soil. This work describes a new variation of in-situ soil reinforcement technology by using surface percolation via – for example – spray irrigation onto dry, free draining ground, such as dunes or dykes. In order to accomplish bacterial immobilization by surface percolation, it was necessary to alternately percolate bacterial suspension and cementation solution (CaCl 2 and urea) to form sequential solution layers within the sand columns. By allowing Ca 2 + ions diffusion between each layer bacterial immobilization could be enhanced from 30...|$|E
30|$|Cement {{is widely}} used as a {{construction}} material to strengthen soil (Stabnikov et al. 2013). However, the production of cement has environment impacts during all stages of manufacturing. Additionally, global cement production accounts for about 5  % of the total industrial energy consumption and 5  % of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions (Worrel et al. 2001). Chemical grout, {{which can be used}} in place of cement to strengthen soil, employs sodium silicate, calcium chloride, calcium hydroxide, acrylates, and acrylamides to bind soil particles (Karol 2003; Ivanov and Chu 2008). However, this method is expensive and toxic to humans and the environment (Karol 2003; DeJong et al. 2006; Ivanov and Chu 2008). Therefore, economical alternatives to chemical grouting are necessary. <b>Biocement</b> is an alternative to cement and chemical grouts (De Muynck et al. 2010; Stabnikov et al. 2011) that can produce binder materials via MICP treatment to seal fractures and improve the strength and durability of cementious materials (Phillips et al. 2013; Dhami et al. 2014). Biocementation of MICP has been applied to strengthen soil and treat the cracks in concrete (Ramachandran et al. 2001; De Muynck et al. 2008). Soil cementation materials include carbonates, hydroxides, phosphates, silicates and sulfides (Ivanov and Chu 2008). Calcium carbonate is primarily used in biocementation because it is commonly found in nature. <b>Biocement</b> can improve soil shear strength through the production of soil particle-binding materials in response to the introduction of bacteria and cementation reagents into the soil (Ng et al. 2012). Different bacterial strains have been shown to produce various levels of urease activity ranging from 2.2 to 20  mM of hydrolyzed urea/min (Harkes et al. 2010; Stabnikov et al. 2013). Urease activity should not be too high or too low for successful biocementation because urease activity in the range of 4.4 to 9.5  mM hydrolyzed urea/min. increased the strength of biocemented soil. Qian et al. (2009) reported that stronger aggregates of calcium carbonate formed at a low rate of urea hydrolysis. Following MICP treatment (by BHI cured bricks), the absorption of water by bricks cured in the media was lower (− 14  %) than that of the control (25  %) because pores were blocked by calcite deposition, which prevented water and other pollutants from penetrating into the body of the bricks (Sarada et al. 2009). Ramachandran (2007) found that incorporation of high concentrations of bacterial cells into the cement mixture reduced compressive strength owing to inference of the biomass with the integrity of the mortar. However, other researchers reported that the compressive strength improved after MICP treatment relative to a control (De Muynck et al. 2008; Chahal et al. 2012).|$|E
40|$|The {{hydrolysis}} of urea by {{the widely}} distributed enzyme urease is special {{in that it}} is one of the few biologically occurring reactions that can generate carbonate ions without an associated production of protons. When this hydrolysis occurs in a calcium-rich environment, calcite (calcium carbonate) precipitates from solution forming a solid-crystalline material. The binding strength of the precipitated crystals is highly dependent on the rate of carbonate formation and under suitable conditions it is possible to control the reaction to generate hard binding calcite cement (or <b>Biocement).</b> The objective of this thesis was to develop an industrially suitable cost-effective microbial process for the production of urease active cells and investigate the potential for urease active cells to act as a catalyst for the production of <b>Biocement.</b> The biocementation capability of two suitable strains was compared. Sporosarcina pasteurii (formally Bacillus pasteurii) produced significantly higher levels of urease activity compared to Proteus vulgaris, however the level of urease activity was variable with respect to biomass suggesting that the enzyme was not constitutive as indicated by the literature, but subject to regulation. The environmental and physiological conditions for maximum urease activity in S. pasteurii were investigated and it was found that the potential urease capacity of the organism was very high (29 mM urea. min- 1. OD- 1) and sufficient for biocementation without additional processing (e. g. concentration, cell lysis). The regulation mechanism for S. pasteurii urease was not fully elucidated in this study, however it was shown that low specific urease activity was not due to depletion of urea nor due to the high concentrations of the main reaction product, ammonium. pH conditions were shown to have a regulatory effect on urease but it was evident that another co-regulating mechanism existed. Despite not fully exploiting the urease capability of S. pasteurii, sufficient urease activity to allow direct application of the enzyme without additional processing could still be achieved and the organism was considered suitable for biocementation. Urease was the most expensive component of the cementation process and cost-efficient production was desired, thus an economic growth procedure was developed for large-scale cultivation of S. pasteurii. The organism is a moderate alkaliphile (growth optimum pH 9. 25) and it was shown that sufficient activity for biocementation could be cultivated in non-sterile conditions with a minimum of upstream and downstream processing.

Neste trabalho, biocimentos de fosfato de cÃlcio, sob a forma pura ou combinada com sulfato de cÃlcio di-hidratado, foram investigados como matrizes em potencial para liberar ampicilina. O comportamento mecÃnico, o tempo de pega, o pH e a porosidade dos biocimentos foram avaliados utilizando amostras em formato de cilindros com 6 mm de altura e 12 mm de diÃmetro. Os dados obtidos foram sujeitos a tratamento estatÃstico para comparar se as mÃdias aritmÃticas entre os nÃveis de aditivos sÃo estatisticamente significantes. Foi demonstrado que a aditivaÃÃo do biocimento convencional DCPD produz um aumento significativo na resistÃncia mecÃnica. Este aumento Ã devido Ã formaÃÃo de cristais em forma de agulhas, que reforÃam a matriz cristalina do biocimento. Ampicilina incorporada aos biocimentos foi liberada em soluÃÃo tampÃo de fosfatos (PBS) Ã temperatura fisiolÃgica e em diferentes tempos de imersÃo. As quantidades de fÃrmaco liberadas foram estimadas a partir de medidas de absorbÃncia no UV-VisÃvel. Comparando os perfis de liberaÃÃo, os resultados indicam que, em 120 minutos de experimento, 3, 85 % do fÃrmaco sÃo liberados da amostra BCF- 10, enquanto a amostra BCF- 00 libera praticamente o triplo, ou seja, 9, 37 %. Este decrÃscimo na taxa de liberaÃÃo provavelmente ocorre em funÃÃo da quantidade de poros presentes nas amostras. Calcium {{phosphate}} biocements {{have been}} object of intense study {{in recent years}} due to their potential utility in biomedical applications. They {{can be used to}} liberate active substances in the human body, as antibiotic or anticancer drugs. In this work, calcium phosphate biocements under the pure or combined form with calcium sulphate had been investigated as to their potential to liberate ampicillin. Mechanical behavior, the time of handling, pH and the porosity of the biocements were evaluated using samples in the shape of cylinders with 6 mm of height and 12 mm of diameter. Test results were submitted to a statistical treatment to determine whether the arithmetic means of the different additive levels are statistically significant or not. It was demonstrated that the adittion of sulphate to conventional <b>biocement</b> DCPD produces {{a significant increase in the}} mechanical resistance. This increase is probably due to the formation of needle-like crystals, that strengthen the crystalline matrix of the <b>biocement.</b> Ampicillin incorporated to the biocements was released in a buffer solution of phosphate (PBS) at the physiological temperature and in different times of immersion. The amounts of drug released were estimated from UV/VIS absorbance measurements of systems (samples) BCF- 00 and BCF- 10. Comparison of the release profiles indicate that in 120 minutes of experiment 3. 85 % of the drug were released from sample BCF- 10, while sample BCF- 00 liberates practically three times as much, that is, 9. 37 %. This decrease in the release tax probably occurs due to the amount of porosity of the samples...|$|E
40|$|Biocements {{formed from}} the {{composition}} Ca/P {{have been studied}} and developed since 1983. These biomaterials are promissing and have aroused great interest to biomedical surgery applications, fixation of prostheses and filling and reconstruction of bones. They can be employed as an element of load to fix implant and bone structure. In addition, biocements are easily shaped during surgical processes and favor early bone habitation, absorption, osseointegration, and osteoconduction of bone structure into the microstructure of the <b>biocement</b> thus favoring regeneration and reconstruction of bone tissue. This paper aims to develop biocements formed from calcium phosphate through the aqueous precipitation method {{by means of the}} dissolution-precipitation reaction, which involves solid/ liquid phase of CaO and phosphoric acid to form the calcium phosphate. The biocements investigated were synthesized when the molar ratios of Ca/P = 1. 4, 1. 5, 1. 6, 1. 7 and 1. 8. The present results indicate that the aqueous precipitation method allowed nanostructured powder of calcium phosphate to form. Thermal treatment at 1300 °C for 2 hours provided biocements formed from calcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite. The study of hydration behaviour from 1 to 28 days in a solution, which contained 0. 4 % of sodium phosphate, emphasized phase modification and the presence of a microporous microstructure made of crystalline fibers. It was found that the shape and size of the crystalline fiber had a direct influence on the resulting mechanical properties. Investigating more carefully the behaviour of the specimens with a Ca/P molar ratio of 1. 5, there was an increase in the strength value under compression as a function of time so that it reached the maximum value of strength ± 45 MPa to specimens that had been hydrated for 28 days...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} an in vivo experiment {{to evaluate the}} resorption rate of a calcium phosphate cement (CPC) with macropores larger than 100 microm, using the CPC called <b>Biocement</b> D (Merck Biomaterial, Darmstadt, Germany), which after setting only shows pores smaller than 1 microm. The gas bubble method used during the setting process created macroporosity. Preset nonporous and porous cement implants were inserted into the trabecular bone of the tibial metaphysis of goats. The size of the preset implants was 6 mm and {{the diameter of the}} drill hole was 6. 3 mm, leaving a gap of 0. 3 mm between implant surface and drill wall. After 2 and 10 weeks, the animals were euthanized and cement implants with surrounding bone were retrieved for histologic evaluation. Light microscopy at 2 weeks revealed that the nonporous implants were surrounded by connective tissue. On the cement surface, we observed a monolayer of multinucleated cells. Ten weeks after implantation, the nonporous implants were still surrounded by connective tissue. However, a thin layer of bone now covered the implant surface. No sign of cement resorption was observed. In contrast, the porous cement evoked a completely different bone response. At 2 weeks, bone formation had already occurred inside the implant porosity. Bone formation even appeared to occur as a result of osteoinduction. Also, at their outer surface, the porous implants were completely surrounded by bone. At 2 weeks, about 31 % of the initial cement was resorbed. After 10 weeks, 81 % of the initial phosphate cement was resorbed and new bone was deposited. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that the creation of macropores can significantly improve the resorption rate of CPC. This increased degradation is associated with almost complete bone replacement...|$|E

Herein, we report the use of novel ultramicrosensors such as pH, Ca²⁺, and redox sensors, along with a scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM), to monitor a real-time, bacteria-mediated urea hydrolysis process and subsequent changes in morphology due to CaCO₃ precipitation. We report that the surface pH of a live biofilm changed rapidly from 7. 4 to 9. 2 within 2 min, whereas similar fast depletion (10 min) of Ca²⁺ was observed from 85 mM to 10 mM {{in the presence of a}} high urea (10 g L⁻¹) brine solution at 23 °C. Both the pH and the Ca²⁺ concentration profiles were extended up to 600 μm from the biofilm surface, whereas the bulk chemical composition of the brine solution remained constant over the entire 4 h of SECM experiments. In addition, we observed a change in biofilm surface morphology and an increase in overall biofilm height of 50 μm after 4 h of precipitation. Electron microscopy confirmed the changes in surface morphology and formation of CaCO₃ crystals. Development of the Ca²⁺ profile took 10 min, whereas that of the pH profile took 2 min. This finding indicates that the initial urea hydrolysis process is fast and limited by urease or number of bacteria, whereas later CaCO₃ formation and growth of crystals is a slow chemical process. The ultramicrosensors and approaches employed here are capable of accurately characterizing bioremediation on temporal and spatial scales pertinent to the microbial communities and the processes they mediate...|$|E
40|$|Microbially-induced CaCO 3 {{precipitation}} (MICP) is {{a naturally}} occurring process wherein durable carbonates are {{formed as a}} result of microbial metabolic activities. In recent years, MICP technology has been widely harnessed for applications in civil engineering wherein synthesis of calcium carbonate crystals occurs at ambient temperature paving way for low energy <b>biocement.</b> MICP using pure urease (UA) and carbonic anhydrase (CA) producing bacteria has been promising in laboratory conditions. In the current study we enriched ureolytic and carbonic anhydrase communities in calcareous soil under biostimulation and bioaugmentation conditions and investigated the effect of microbial dynamics on carbonate precipitation, calcium carbonate polymorph selection and consolidation of biological sand column under nutrient limited and rich conditions. All treatments for stimulation and augmentation led to significant changes in the composition of indigenous bacterial population. Biostimulation as well as augmentation through the UA route was found to be faster and more effective compared to the CA route in terms of extracellular enzyme production and carbonate precipitation. Synergistic role of augmented cultures along with indigenous communities was recorded via both the routes of UA and CA as more effective calcification was seen in case of augmentation compared to stimulation. The survival of supplemented isolates in presence of indigenous bacterial communities was confirmed through sequencing of total diversity and it was seen that both UA and CA isolate had the potential to survive along with native communities under high nutrient conditions. Nutrient conditions played significant role in determining calcium carbonate polymorph fate as calcitic crystals dominated under high carbon supplementation. Finally, the consolidation of sand columns via stimulation and augmentation was successfully achieved through both UA and CA route under high nutrient conditions but higher consolidation in short time period was noticed in UA route. The study reports that based upon the organic carbon content in native soils, stimulation can be favored at sites with high organic carbon content while augmentation with repeated injections of nutrients can be applied on poor nutrient soils via different enrichment routes of microbial metabolism...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{performance}} of small scale cemented soil columns produced using soil mixing with cement resulting from bacterially mediated reactions that precipitate calcium carbonate, a process {{often referred to as}} bio-cementation. Bio-cementation has received considerable research attention over the last decade as {{it has the potential to}} complement existing ground improvement techniques and mitigate environmental concerns with currently used materials. Previous research has concentrated on pumping and injection techniques because of concerns that bacteria will be unable to survive the stresses associated with industrial mixing processes, however it has been difficult to create uniform bio-cemented soil masses. In this thesis the ureolytic bacterium, Bacillus Megateri urn, not previously reported in bio-cementation studies, has been investigated to determine its viability and efficiency as a microbe for mediating the calcite precipitation. It has been found that the highest hydrolysis rate is recorded when calcium concentrations are double the urea concentrations, and that significant amounts of calcite can be precipitated in a single mixing process. Unconfined compressive strength: (UCS) tests and a series of triaxial tests have been conducted to quantify the effects of the bio-cementation on the mechanical response. Bender elements mounted in the triaxial cell have also been used to monitor the shear wave velocity during curing and shearing. The results of mechanical tests on the bio-cemented sand have been compared with tests on gypsum cemented and uncemented specimens. It has been found that bio-cementation by mixing produces homogeneous specimens with similar strengths and stiffnesses to the commonly used flushing or injection technique. To assess {{the performance of}} in-situ mixed, 38 mm diameter, bio-cemented sand columns a small scale in-situ mixing technique was used to create the model columns. Foundation tests have been performed at 1 -g in a cylindrical tank with diameter of 600 mm. A significant improvement was observed in the response of foundations when placed on bio-cemented columns, and this was similar to the improvement from more conventional gypsum cements. These tests confirmed the feasibility of using an in-situ mixing technique with bio-cementation and provided valuable insight into the factors that must be considered in developing field applications. This thesis also has demonstrated repair strategies and techniques to encourage healing and selfhealing should damage occur in foundations.

40|$|To repair massive bone defects {{caused by}} disease and trauma, a bone {{grafting}} procedure is required. The limitations {{associated with the}} use of autografts (tissue grafts from one point to another of the same individual's body) and allografts (tissue grafts between genetically nonidentical individuals) have boosted the research and development of bone graft substitutes. Calcium phosphate cement (CPC) is a promising bone graft substitute because of its bioactivity, osteoconductivity and bone replacement capability. However, difficulties with injectability and slow resorption rate have limited the wider applications of CPC. To overcome these limitations, premixed and injectable calcium deficient apatite <b>biocement</b> (cd-AB) were prepared in the initial phase of this study. Using a non-aqueous solution as the liquid phase, the resulting premixed cd-AB had the advantage of remaining stable in the syringe and only hardened following delivery to the defect site. As well, when injected into an aqueous environment, this premixed cd-AB exhibited improved washout resistance when compared to the conventional cd-AB using water as the liquid phase. However, the premixed cd-AB required a longer setting time and developed a reduced compressive strength compared to the conventional cd-AB. The hydration products of premixed cd-AB were a mixture of calcium deficient hydroxyapatite (cd-HA) and PLA. In vitro Tris-HCl immersion tests demonstrated that the premixed cd-AB was degradable. The results revealed that the premixed cd-AB was cytocompatible and no adverse effects were observed after attachment and proliferation of MG- 63 osteoblast-like cells in vitro. The most distinct advantages of premixed and injectable PLA-modified cd-AB were its excellent washout resistance and in vitro degradability, suggesting that it may be a promising candidate for future bone reconstruction. In recent years, bone tissue engineering has emerged as a promising approach for the repair of bone damage and defects. In this approach, a scaffold is normally used alone or in combination with growth factors and/or cells to guide bone regeneration. Among the synthetic polymers used as scaffold materials, poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) has been widely used given its excellent biocompatibility and ease of processing. However, the use of PCL scaffolds is limited as a consequence of potential drawbacks including a slow degradation rate and their hydrophobic surface. These disadvantages may be overcome by incorporating additional natural polymer or inorganic fillers into the PCL matrix. In the second section of this study, porous scaffolds of zein/PCL biocomposite were fabricated and characterized. These scaffolds were prepared using the particulate leaching method with sodium chloride particles as porogen. Porous biocomposite scaffolds with porosity around 70 % and well-interconnected network were obtained. The incorporation of zein into PCL led to an improvement of the surface hydrophilicity as confirmed by the results of water contact angle measurement. Following immersion in a phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) in vitro for 28 days, it was observed that the zein/PCL scaffolds degraded more rapidly than the PCL scaffolds and the degradation rate could be controlled by adjusting the amount of zein in the composite. These results demonstrated the potential of the zein/PCL biocomposite scaffolds to be exploited in tissue engineering strategies for the repair of bone defects. In the final section of this study, porous scaffolds using a magnesium phosphate (MP) /PCL biocomposite were developed for bone tissue engineering applications. The composite scaffolds were fabricated by the particulate leaching method again using sodium chloride particles as porogen. The resulting scaffolds had interconnected macroporous structure with porosity around 73 %. The surface hydrophilicity of the scaffolds was enhanced by the incorporation of MP component and confirmed by water contact angle measurement. The results from subsequent in vitro degradation experiments showed that the MP/PCL composite scaffolds degraded faster than PCL scaffolds in a PBS solution. An additional benefit was that the degradation rate of the scaffolds could be tuned by adjusting the content of MP component in the composite. These results indicated that the MP/PCL composite scaffolds have potential application in bone tissue engineering. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|This {{study has}} contributed to the {{patented}} technology of <b>biocement</b> (Microbial Biocementation, WO/ 2006 / 066326). Biocementation or biogrout is a sand consolidation technology, in which the carbonate released from microbial urea hydrolysis precipitates with an excess of calcium ions to form in-situ calcite (CaCO 3) precipitation. Under the right conditions this can result in soil solidification and has found significant commercial interest. This study has enriched and isolated highly urease active bacteria, particularly suitable for the fermentation process. Six strains with different properties relevant for biocementation were isolated. The most urease active strain (strain MCP 11) produced sufficient urease to allow the use of the non-concentrated cell suspension for biocementation experiments. Activities and specific activities were 11 - 28 mM urea hydrolysed. min- 1 and 2. 2 - 5. 6 mM urea hydrolysed. min- 1. OD- 1 respectively. A separate strain (strain MCP 4) showed spontaneous flocculation {{at the end of the}} batch growth, showing its increased tendency to attach to surfaces. This can be useful for effective cell concentration and for improved attachment during the cementation process. The possibility of causing cementation by using enrichments rather than pure strains has been documented. This may allow a cheaper production of the urease than by traditional pure culture processes. Urease production was optimised by increasing the concentration of yeast extract and the addition of Ni 2 + ions to the growth media, resulting in increasing urease activity as the reproducible urease yield. This was accomplished by the addition of 10 μM Ni 2 + ions and increasing the level of yeast extract to 20 g. L- 1 Some of the isolated strains were suitable for biocementation process producing mechanical strength (≥ 0. 6 MPa) within several hours depending on the rate of urea conversion. This mechanical strength enhancement of the cemented columns was performed without a large decrease in the permeability. The formation of CaCO 3 crystals in the presence of high concentration of calcium and urea was monitored. This crystal growth was monitored over time by video recording the ureolytic reaction on a microscopic slide. The crystals also were examined through SEM. It was found that two types of CaCO 3 precipitates were formed; these precipitates were calcite rhombohedral crystals and spheroids. Video clips showed that the rhombohedral crystals originated from the spheroids. These spheroids were fragile, not stable and were considered to be vaterite. This study suggested that the strength of the cemented column was caused mostly due to the point-to-point contacts of rhombohedral CaCO 3 crystals and adjacent sand grains. A method of producing high strength cemented samples from sand was developed. This method first attaches the cells into the sand-column by growing them in the presence of calcium ions as little as 6 mM. Then, the cells were incubated in-situ for about 48 hours to enable attachment to the surface of the sand granules. Then the cells were reused over 20 -times by continuous supply of cementation solution (equi-molar concentration of calcium and urea). This method produced a mechanical strength of up to 30 MPa, which is equivalent to construction cement. The mechanical strength could be increased by supplying the bacteria in-situ with a food source and 10 μM Ni 2 + ions, allowing some measures of reaction rate control in-situ. To our knowledge, this study was the first study to use biological cementation to produce strength comparable to that of traditional cemented construction materials such as sandstone and concrete. The key factors for the optimal CaCO 3 precipitation (strength production) in-situ were examined. It was found that in-situ urease activity was the key factor for strength production. The maximum in-situ urease activity was achieved by supplementing the cementation solution with growth media, and the use of 0. 5 M urea and Ca 2 + as cementation solution. The in-situ urease activity differed according to the different bacterial strains which tolerated the cementation conditions differently. One of the advantages of the present study was that cementation of porous media could be achieved without clogging the injection end. The injection end could be clogged by CaCO 3 precipitation due to cementation reaction (cells, calcium and urea). By sequentially flushing the cells and cementation solution, clogging of the injection end could be avoided and high penetration depth was achieved as long as there was sufficient passage of cementation solution. Uniform cementation along 1 m packed sand-column was obtained. This uniformity was confirmed by the urease activity measurement, calcite precipitation and mechanical strength production. For finer sand, homogenous cementation proved more difficult...|$|E
