5|$|On August 11, General Anthony Zinni of Central Command was {{instructed}} to plan attacks on bin Laden's Khost camps, where CIA intelligence indicated <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>and</b> other militants would be meeting on August 20, purportedly to plan further attacks against the U.S. Clinton was informed of the plan on August 12 and 14. Participants in the meeting later disagreed {{whether or not the}} intelligence indicated bin Laden would attend the meeting; however, an objective of the attack remained to kill the al-Qaeda leader, and the NSC encouraged the strike regardless of whether <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>and</b> his companions were known to be present at Khost. The administration aimed to prevent future al-Qaeda attacks discussed in intercepted communications. As Berger later testified, the operation also sought to damage bin Laden's infrastructure and show the administration's commitment to combating bin Laden. The Khost complex, which was 90 miles southeast of Kabul, also had ideological significance: Bin Laden had fought nearby during the Soviet–Afghan War, and he had given interviews and even held a press conference at the site.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the attacks came from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who first {{presented}} it to Osama bin Laden in 1996. At that time, <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>and</b> al-Qaeda were {{in a period of}} transition, having just relocated back to Afghanistan from Sudan. The 1998 African Embassy bombings and bin Laden's 1998 fatwā marked a turning point, as bin Laden became intent on attacking the United States.|$|E
5|$|The missile {{strikes on}} al-Qaeda's Afghan {{training}} camps, aimed at preempting more attacks and killing bin Laden, damaged the installations and inflicted an uncertain number of casualties; however, bin Laden {{was not present}} at the time. Following the attacks, the ruling Taliban allegedly reneged on a promise to Saudi intelligence chief Turki al-Faisal to hand over <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> <b>and</b> the regime instead strengthened its ties with the al-Qaeda chief.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Saleh engaged several NDS agents infiltrating the Pakistani {{tribal areas}} {{to search for}} <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>and</b> other al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders. Several al-Qaeda members could be identified, but it was {{determined}} that Bin Laden was not in the area. In 2006, Saleh was presented with evidence that bin Laden was living in a major settled area of Pakistan just 20 miles from the town of Abbottabad, Pakistan. He shared the intelligence with former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf who angrily brushed off the claim, taking no action.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to a 1996 State Department warning about <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>and</b> the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa by al-Qaeda (which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans), Clinton ordered several military missions to capture or kill bin Laden, {{both of which were}} unsuccessful. In August 1998, Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, targeting the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan, which was suspected of assisting bin Laden in making chemical weapons, and bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Pakistan {{came under}} intense {{international}} scrutiny after the raid. The Pakistani government denied {{that it had}} sheltered <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> <b>and</b> said it had shared information with the CIA and other intelligence agencies about the compound since 2009. The United States had direct evidence that the ISI chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, knew of bin Laden’s presence in Abbottabad, Pakistan. After the raid, there was an unconfirmed report that Pakistan allowed Chinese military officials to examine {{the wreckage of the}} crashed helicopter.|$|E
50|$|Contrary to the movie, {{the head}} of the Northern Alliance, Ahmed Shah Massoud, was nowhere near the alleged <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> camp <b>and</b> {{therefore}} could not have seen Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden.</b>|$|R
40|$|This book {{examines}} public worrying over 'ethnic crime' {{and what}} it tells us about Australia today. How, for instance, can the blame {{for a series of}} brutal group sexual assaults in Sydney be so widely attributed to whole ethnic communities? How is it that the arrival of a foundering boatload of asylum-seekers mostly seeking refuge from despotic regimes in 'the Middle East' can be manipulated to characterise complete cohorts of applicants for refuge 'and their immigrant compatriots' as dangerous, dishonest, criminally inclined and inhuman? How did the airborne terror attacks on the USA on 11 September 2001 exacerbate existing tendencies in Australia to stereotype Arabs and Muslims as backward, inassimilable, without respect for Western laws and values, and complicit with barbarism <b>and</b> terrorism? <b>Bin</b> <b>Laden</b> in the Suburbs argues that we are witnessing the emergence of the 'Arab Other' as the pre-eminent 'folk devil' of our time. This Arab Other functions in the national imaginary to prop up the project of national belonging. It {{has little to do with}} the lived experiences of Arab, Middle Eastern or Muslim Australians, and everything to do with a host of social anxieties which overlap in a series of moral panics. <b>Bin</b> <b>Laden</b> in the Suburbs analyses a decisive moment in the history of multiculturalism in Australia. 'Unlike most migrants, the Arab migrant is a subversive will [...] . They invade our shores, take over our neighbourhood and rape our women. They are all little <b>bin</b> <b>Ladens</b> <b>and</b> they are everywhere: Explicit <b>bin</b> <b>Ladens</b> <b>and</b> closet <b>bin</b> Ladens; Conscious <b>bin</b> <b>Ladens</b> <b>and</b> unconscious <b>bin</b> Ladens; <b>bin</b> <b>Ladens</b> on the beach <b>and</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Ladens</b> in the suburbs, as this book is aptly titled. Within this register [...] . even a single Arab is a threat. Contain the Arab or exterminate the Arab? A 'tolerable' presence in the suburbs, or caged in a concentration camp? [...] . The politics of the Western post-colonial state is constantly and dangerously oscillating between these tendencies today. It is this dangerous oscillation that is so lucidly exposed in this book'. ...|$|R

5|$|U.S. {{officials}} {{said there were}} 22 people in the compound. Five were killed, including Osama bin Laden. Pakistani officials gave conflicting reports suggesting between 12 and 17 survivors. The Sunday Times subsequently published excerpts from a pocket guide, presumably dropped by the SEALs during the raid, containing pictures and descriptions of likely compound residents. The guide listed several adult children of <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>and</b> their families who were not ultimately found in the compound. Because {{of a lack of}} verifiable information, some of what follows is thinly sourced.|$|E
5|$|It {{states that}} {{the theory of the}} Arab hijackers was created by the CIA, and that these Arabs may not even have been aware that the planes were going to crash. Seven of the alleged hijackers are claimed in the book to have been found alive and well after the attacks. The book explores the {{possibility}} that the various aircraft could have been remote-controlled. It cites observations in support of the theory that the collapse of the World Trade Center might have been due to explosives. Von Bülow does not believe that Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>and</b> al-Qaeda are responsible for the 9/11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jenna {{gets into}} trouble after she is misquoted in Maxim magazine, {{allegedly}} {{saying that she}} hates the troops. This happened due to Jenna mishearing the interviewer and thinking he meant theater troupes. The resulting outrage prompts Jack to get her an interview on Hardball with Chris Matthews to clear up the confusion over her comments. During the interview, Jenna confuses Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>and</b> then-Senator Barack Obama, who was running for the Democratic Party nomination for President. A further attempt to clear Jenna's name backfires when swastikas are accidentally brandished on the TGS with Tracy Jordan stage.|$|E
50|$|The Agency, however, {{began to}} be {{concerned}} than <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> would extend his activities beyond Afghanistan. It experimented with various internal organizations that could focus on subjects such as <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> specifically <b>and</b> al-Qaeda generally.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the wealthy}} <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> family disowned Osama in 1994 after his alleged {{involvement}} in terrorism like the 1993 World Trade Center bombings, {{the events of}} 9/11 brought to attention connections between the <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> family <b>and</b> the Bush family. [...] It has been alleged that Osama was never disowned and that his family were aware of his activities in the years preceding 9/11. The connections between the <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> family <b>and</b> Bush family have led to conspiracy theories that President George Bush was also aware of Osama's activities and deliberately allowed 9/11 to take place.|$|R
50|$|The UN Security Council, on 16 January 2002, {{unanimously}} {{established an}} arms embargo and the freezing of identifiable assets belonging to <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> al-Qaeda, <b>and</b> the remaining Taliban.|$|R
5|$|Morrow {{ordered the}} {{motorcade}} {{to turn around}} at the Bridge Street intersection because he realised that they had proceeded further than expected, and because the police officers {{were not going to}} stop them. After partially turning the motorcade, Licciardello alighted onto the street and complained, in character as bin Laden, about not being invited to the APEC Summit. At this point, the police requested Morrow's identity. After inspecting his fake pass, officers realised that Morrow was from The Chaser and took all eleven members of the motorcade into custody. Surprisingly, as pointed out by the team on their television show, the officers initially ignored Licciardello (Osama <b>Bin</b> <b>Laden)</b> <b>and</b> only arrested Morrow.|$|E
5|$|The Canberra Roller Derby League {{has its own}} referee squad {{known as}} Team Zulu. For the 2011 season, the referees were Magic Strat, Refucious, J Ref.

Canberra Roller Derby League referees have been {{involved}} with interstate bouts, and Refucious, John Ref Kennedy and Magic Strat were part of the squad that refereed the Sydney City Assassins versus Vice City Rollers bout on 12December 2010. John Ref Kennedy, Fair-as Bueller and Major Dyck were part of the referee squad for the Vice City Rollers bout against the Sunstate Roller Girls Fancy Pants on 6August 2011.|$|E
5|$|Two SEALs {{broke through}} the bedroom door. Bin Laden's wife Amal was {{on the edge of}} the bed {{shouting}} in Arabic at the SEALs, and Osama bin Laden dived across the bed, shoving Amal at the same time, for an AKS-74U kept by the headboard. The SEALs fired four shots at bin Laden; the first missed, the second grazed Amal in the calf also missing <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> <b>and</b> the final two hit bin Laden in the chest and head, killing him instantly. In Pfarrer's account, the total time elapsed from jumping on the roof to Osama bin Laden's death was between 30 and 90 seconds.|$|E
50|$|His ties to Islamic {{extremism}} {{also became}} increasingly documented {{towards the end}} of his life. It emerged his dawah centre, IPCI, was heavily financed by the <b>Bin</b> <b>Laden</b> family <b>and</b> that he had personally met Osama <b>Bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> whom he described positively.|$|R
50|$|One notable {{example of}} the {{relationship}} between terror groups and the media was the release of the Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> audio <b>and</b> video recordings. These tapes were sent directly to mainstream Arabic television networks including Al-Jazeera.|$|R
50|$|Another {{article in}} the Asharq Alawsat {{identified}} other individual from the list, including: Abdullah al-Abaed—wanted for the assassination of a senior police official, and Mohamed Abul-Khair, one of Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Ladens</b> bodyguards, <b>and</b> one of his sons-in-law.|$|R
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the U.S. was {{planning}} its own actions against bin Laden. Michael Scheuer, {{chief of the}} CIA's bin Laden unit (Alec Station), considered using local Afghans to kidnap bin Laden, then exfiltrate him from Afghanistan in a modified Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Documents recovered from Wadih el-Hage's Nairobi computer suggested a link between <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>and</b> the deaths of U.S. troops in Somalia. These were used {{as the foundation for}} the June 1998 New York indictment of bin Laden, although the charges were later dropped. The planned raid was cancelled in May after internecine disputes between officials at the FBI and the CIA; the hesitation of the National Security Council (NSC) to approve the plan; concerns over the raid's chance of success, and the potential for civilian casualties.|$|E
5|$|Mansoor Ijaz was {{involved}} in unofficial negotiations between the U.S. and Sudanese governments in 1996 and 1997 to obtain access to Sudan's intelligence files on Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>and</b> the early remnants of Al-Qaeda's network there after efforts to extradite bin Laden to the U.S. failed in early 1996. In the same year, the United States Congress imposed sanctions against Khartoum over allegations of harboring and abetting terrorist cells on its soil. In early 1996, CIA and State Department officials held secret meetings near Washington D.C. with Sudan's then-defense minister, El Fatih Erwa. In May 1996, bin Laden left Sudan for Afghanistan {{under pressure from the}} United States when the meetings failed to reconcile U.S. demands made of Khartoum about its record in aiding, abetting and harboring known terrorist groups and individuals.|$|E
5|$|On 6 September 2007, eight {{members of}} the team (including five runners dressed as bodyguards) and three hired chauffeurs manned a fake Canadian {{motorcade}} consisting of two motorcycles, two black four-wheel drive vehicles, and a black sedan. The group—including Chas Licciardello dressed as Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> <b>and</b> Julian Morrow—drove the motorcade through the Sydney central business district and breached the APEC security zone. The premise of the stunt was that bin Laden should have been invited to the summit as a world leader, to discuss the War on Terror, with another motive being to test the event's security. The stunt was approved by ABC lawyers under the assumption that the motorcade would be stopped at the first security checkpoint and denied entry.|$|E
50|$|Shalabi {{arrived on}} January 11, 2002, {{the day the}} camp opened, and he was {{released}} on September 21, 2015.He is regularly described as an Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> bodyguard <b>and</b> a member of al Qaeda—accusations he consistently disputed.|$|R
5000|$|The film's final shot {{features}} Bush <b>and</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> skipping {{through a}} field together, hand-in-hand. As mushroom clouds explode on the horizon, <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> laughs <b>and</b> says, [...] "Georgie, I {{think this is}} the beginning of a beautiful friendship". At that moment, all of the nuclear missiles hit, and the country is destroyed.|$|R
50|$|As a news producer, she {{has covered}} such events as, {{the death of}} Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> Shock <b>and</b> Awe, the {{election}} of President Barack Obama, the Great Recession, Arab Spring, Hurricane Katrina, the earthquake in Haiti, among countless others.|$|R
5|$|The NATO council {{declared}} {{the attacks on}} the United States were an attack on all NATO nations which satisfied Article 5 of the NATO charter. This marked the first invocation of Article 5, which had been written during the Cold War with an attack by the Soviet Union in mind. Australian Prime Minister John Howard who was in Washington D.C. during the attacks invoked Article IV of the ANZUS treaty. The Bush administration announced a War on Terror, with the stated goals of bringing <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>and</b> al-Qaeda to justice and preventing the emergence of other terrorist networks. These goals would be accomplished by imposing economic and military sanctions against states harboring terrorists, and increasing global surveillance and intelligence sharing.|$|E
5|$|American {{officials}} later {{acknowledged that}} the evidence cited by the U.S. in its rationale for the Al-Shifa strike was weaker than initially believed: The facility had not been involved in chemical weapons production, and was not connected to bin Laden. The $30 million Al-Shifa factory, which had a $199,000 contract with the UN under the Oil-for-Food Programme, employed 300 Sudanese and provided {{over half of the}} country's pharmaceuticals, including medicines for malaria, diabetes, gonorrhea, and tuberculosis. A Sudanese named Salah Idris purchased the plant in March 1998; while the CIA later said it found financial ties between Idris and the bin Laden-linked terrorist group Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the agency had been unaware at the time that Idris owned the Al-Shifa facility. Idris later denied any links to <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>and</b> sued to recover $24 million in funds frozen by the U.S., {{as well as for the}} damage to his factory. Idris hired investigations firm Kroll Inc., which reported in February 1999 that neither Idris nor Al-Shifa was connected to terrorism.|$|E
5|$|In an August 10 Small Group meeting, the {{principals}} agreed to use Tomahawk cruise missiles, rather than troops or aircraft, in the retaliatory strikes. Cruise missiles {{had been previously}} used against Libya and Iraq as reprisals for the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing and the 1993 attempted assassination of then-President George H. W. Bush. Using cruise missiles also helped to preserve secrecy; airstrikes would have required more preparation that might have leaked {{to the media and}} alerted bin Laden. The option of using commandos was discarded, as it required too much time to prepare forces, logistics, and combat search and rescue. Using helicopters or bombers would have been difficult {{due to the lack of}} a suitable base or Pakistani permission to cross its airspace, and the administration also feared a recurrence of the disastrous 1980 Operation Eagle Claw in Iran. While military officials suggested bombing Kandahar, which <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>and</b> his associates often visited, the administration was concerned about killing civilians and hurting the U.S.' image.|$|E
25|$|In an 2016 TV interview, Imran Khan {{refused to}} call Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> a {{terrorist}} <b>and</b> compared him to George Washington.|$|R
50|$|Walt {{rejected}} the recommendation, harshly criticizing Bin Laden's beliefs and proclaiming opposition both to what <b>Bin</b> <b>Laden</b> did <b>and</b> what he stands for. He then conjectured that <b>Bin</b> <b>Laden</b> endorsed the book because he sees Israel {{as a threat}} to peace in the Middle East; with Walt adding that this is no revolutionary idea.|$|R
50|$|The book {{includes}} 26 {{documents of}} contemporary Islamic terrorist leaders and {{groups such as}} Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> al-Qaeda, Hamas <b>and</b> the PLO.|$|R
