40|$|A {{suite of}} {{distinctive}} freshwater subaerial phosphatic stromatolites is developed {{close to the}} northeastern entrance of Deer Cave, Gunung Mulu National Park, Sarawak, Borneo, in conditions of very low light but ample supply of nutrients from guano. These stromatolites are not particulate; they are composed of alternating layers of more porous and more dense amorphous hydroxylapatite. This biomineralization occurs as moulds of coccoid (the majority) and filamentous (less abundant) cyanobacteria. Mineralization occurs at a pH of ~ 7. 0 in the extracellular sheaths and in micro-domains of varying carbonate content in the surrounding mucus of the biofilm. The most recent surfaces that are not yet strongly mineralized show still-living filamentous, coccoid and rod-shaped forms. Trace element composition shows enrichment in metal ions, especially Mn and Zn. The stromatolites are present as horizontal shelves arranged in series on a steep rock face that is vertically under a guano-laden shelf. The rock face undergoes active dissolution from acidic guano drainage water (e. g., pH of 2. 43) and from aggressive rainwater from an overhead discharge. However, the rock surface under the stromatolite is protected {{while the rest of}} the cliff face is <b>backcut,</b> creating a hoodoo-like effect. The stromatolites are ~ 15 – 20 cm deep, ~ 4 – 7 cm thick, and of variable width, generally ~ 50 cm. Eventually, guano and biological detritus in the descending water film lodge in the lee of the stromatolite lip, causing local acidification and erosion of stromatolite and rock on the underside of the ledge. A dynamic equilibrium is established between upward accretion of the fresh surface and destruction at the base such that the base of the stromatolite does not reflect the date of its inception and the stromatolite climbs up the wall...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: In die {{and mold}} industries, surface {{roughness}} of the dies and molds produced {{will determine the}} end product quality. Therefore, the desired finish surface was specified and the appropriate processes were selected to reach the required quality. Among many contributors to surface quality problem, <b>backcutting</b> {{is one of the}} factors influencing the surface roughness. Approach: The aim for current research was to study the <b>backcutting</b> phenomena and their effect to the surface roughness of work material, AISI H 13 with hardness of 48 HRC during high speed end milling. Machining performed on the Vertical Milling Centre (VMC) high cutting speed from 150 - 250 m min− 1, feed rate 0. 05 - 0. 15 mm tooth− 1 and depth of cut 0. 1 - 0. 5 mm. The analysis and observation of the <b>backcutting</b> phenomena are done by using optical surface roughness machine. Results: The result shown that the pattern of surface roughness was not sufficient enough to compare between the surface with <b>backcutting</b> and without <b>backcutting</b> and the <b>backcutting</b> phenomena were seen mostly in combination of medium to high cutting speed and medium to high feedrate. Conclusion/Recommendations: Further research is needed with incrimination of experiments and adjustments of parameters...|$|R

40|$|A silicon mold was {{reproduced}} in stainless steel, iron and silver {{and it was}} shown that minimum structures of 20 mu m and an aspect ratio of up to 5 could be produced. Micrographs show that some <b>backcuts</b> and a rough surface of the mold may have prevented even better results. First experiments to obtain not only microstructures but also isolated parts using MPM have also been performed and show the possibility of manufacturing them. Future work will be concerned with the application of nanopowder in metal injection molding, {{as well as the}} processing of other materials e. g. functional and hard materials. Thus, MPM is a suitable technique for the reproduction of fine structures and parts which may have applications in miniature motors, pumps and reactors. More work {{needs to be done to}} adapt the processing to the available molds and dies and the handling to the small dimensions of microparts and to other microsystem technology processes...|$|R
