500|$|In January 2015, showrunners Michele Fazekas and Tara Butters {{confirmed}} that Agent Carter {{was not intended}} to be a miniseries, and that a possible second season would not necessarily be limited to eight episodes like the first. The series was renewed for a second season on May 7, 2015, intended to debut in 2016 of the 2015–16 season during the midseason break of the third season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Later in May, Hayley Atwell stated the season would consist of 10 episodes. Butters explained that this would probably not allow for any standalone episodes, [...] "but I definitely think it allows for more character, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> have more personal stories built into the framework of the overall arching mystery".|$|E

[...] The segment was met with mixed reception from students at University of Michigan–Dearborn. A number of them were interviewed by Gallagher in his report. One student said: [...] "It's pretty cool showing how ridiculous the hate is.

[...] The end of the episode [...] "What If..." [...] features an onscreen tribute to Bill Paxton, who died in February 2017 and had portrayed John Garrett in the series' first season.

500|$|It {{was during}} this time, {{the heyday of the}} French Revolution, that Barbauld {{published}} her most radical political pieces. From 1787 to 1790, Charles James Fox attempted to convince the House of Commons to pass a law granting Dissenters full citizenship rights. When this bill was defeated for the third time, Barbauld wrote one of her most passionate pamphlets, An Address to the Opposers of the Repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts. Readers were shocked to discover that such a well-reasoned argument should come from a woman. In 1791, after William Wilberforce's attempt to outlaw the slave trade failed, Barbauld published her Epistle to William Wilberforce Esq. On the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade, which not only lamented the fate of the slaves, but also warned of the cultural and social degeneration the British could expect if they did not abandon slavery. In 1792, she continued this theme of national responsibility in an anti-war sermon entitled Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation which argued that each individual is responsible for the actions of the nation: [...] "We are called upon to repent of national sins, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> help them, and because we ought to help them." ...|$|E
500|$|The Bears {{travelled}} to Heinz Field to {{face the}} winless Pittsburgh Steelers in their first NBC Sunday Night Football matchup of the season. Pittsburgh had lost the previous week to Cincinnati to fall to 0–2 {{for the first time}} in 11 years. In the last game between the two in 2009, the Bears triumphed 17–14. The Bears were the 1-point favorites; eight CBSSports.com experts voted on their predictions for the game, with a 5–3 result favoring Chicago, while four ESPN analysts predicted that the Steelers would win. One of the goals of the defense was to contain Ben Roethlisberger in the passing pocket, especially as the offensive line suffered the loss of center Maurkice Pouncey. Additionally, the Steelers also had the 31st-ranked rushing offense and had yet to score a rushing touchdown, who was expected to regain first-rounder Le'Veon Bell. Alan Rubenstein of ChicagoNow writes that the Bears should attempt to improve their pass rush, which was only able to record two sacks in the last two games. Marc Trestman cited the weather as a factor for the poor performance, stating, [...] "It’s tough to rush the passer in wet weather... For both sides. It’s tough to get a pass rush with a soggy field and a wet field. It’s an advantage throwing the football. On a rainy day (versus) no rain, really the advantage goes to the offense. <b>Because</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> sit back there and protect. And it’s really hard to configure a pass rush to get close." [...] On offense, the Bears should attempt to attack the Steelers' 14th-ranked rush defense. A key matchup was the WR-CB duel between Brandon Marshall and Ike Taylor; Taylor contained Bengals receiver A. J. Green, who recorded 162 yards against the Bears in week one, to just six catches for 41 yards in week two.|$|E

2500|$|This {{has led to}} {{continuity}} problems. Early {{histories of}} races such as the Daleks were rewritten. Writer Paul Cornell, discussing continuity errors, opines that the modern programme's Time War can explain away (or retcon) such discontinuities, giving the example of Earth's different destructions in The Ark (1966) and [...] "The End of the World" [...] (2005). Writer and Doctor Who executive producer Steven Moffat has gone further, arguing that [...] "a television series which embraces both the ideas of parallel universes {{and the concept of}} changing time can't have a continuity error – it's impossible for Doctor Who to get it wrong, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> just say 'he changed time'".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a theoretical}} and methodological concept, which ties {{in with the}} tradition of the German pioneer in action-orientated geography, Wolfgang Hartke. In his view, which is hardly known in the Anglo-Saxon debate, geography should analyse how "geographies" are made by capital investment. His idea can be taken as social geography's perspective on the economic, which contributes to the ongoing debate about the subject and aims of economic geography. In this perspective, economic action means individual action in economic contexts such as firms or markets, closely relating organisation theory and explanatory management approaches to the concept. To theorise space and its relation to economic action we hark back to Benno Werlen's concept of everyday regionalisation. "We are worried about political problems <b>because</b> <b>we</b> think <b>we</b> <b>can</b> make politics, whereas it's high time to make geography" (Hartke, 1962 : 115, translation Van Wezemael) ...|$|R

Steven Moffat, writer and later executive producer for Doctor Who, has gone further, arguing that [...] "a television series which embraces both the ideas of parallel universes and the concept of changing time can't have a continuity error—it's impossible for Doctor Who to get it wrong, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> just say 'he changed time—it's a time ripple from the Time War.|$|E

The album {{was released}} independently under his label Lench Mob.

2500|$|His first {{objection}} {{is that we}} have {{no experience}} of world-making. Hume highlighted the fact that everything we claim to know the cause of, we have derived the inductions from previous experiences of similar objects being created or seen the object itself being created ourselves. For example, with a watch, we know it has to be created by a watch-maker <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> observe it being made and compare it to the making of other similar watches or objects to deduce they have alike causes in their creation.

2500|$|Daniel Dennett {{argued that}} {{the way we think}} we are seeing the world is, for the most part, an illusion. Part of Dennett's {{argument}} is the claim that each of us possess what he calls a [...] "Cartesian theater", in which we believe there is a full representation of the visual world in our mind {{and that there is a}} place in the mind where it is observed. According to Dennett, none of this exists. Instead, the only place where a full and rich representation exists is directly on the fovea, and every time a saccade occurs, the information is overwritten. Therefore, there is no such thing as transsaccadic memory. Information previously lost only appears to be retained in visual memory <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> look again. In this way, the outside world acts as a visual memory. Since our eyes are constantly moving, we are not aware that visual inputs are constantly being refreshed to give the illusion of the completed picture we think we are seeing.|$|E
