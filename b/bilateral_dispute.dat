The cases suggest limits to the EU's transformative power in the context of disputes that are linked to the meaning and significance of borders.

40|$|Restricted until 29 Sep. 2012. This thesis {{examines}} {{the variations in}} both the level of patent protection and changes therein across countries and over time. The main finding is that both domestic economic, political and legal characteristics as well as bilateral and multilateral dispute settlement mechanisms are important in raising countries’ patent rights protection in the past decades.; More specifically, my studies confirm that domestic economic development, associated with R&D investment, {{is the main reason}} for countries to improve their patent protection, with human capital, political freedom and trade openness as contributing factors. Furthermore, Common Law countries and German Civil Law countries tend to provide higher protection for patent rights than French Civil Law countries, although its effect on patent protection might not be direct but probably only indirect through its effect on R&D and trade openness. Last but not least, <b>bilateral</b> <b>dispute</b> settlement mechanisms, represented by the U. S. ’s Special 301 placements and Section 306 monitoring, have significantly and consistently positive effects on propelling target countries to provide higher legislative protection for patents, just as bilateral investment treaties (BITs) with the U. S. do. Designating a country as “Priority Foreign County”, which is the most severe but seldom used instrument of “unilateral aggressiveness”, did not by itself contribute to the improvement of patent protection according to the results. It does, however, work with other bilateral coercive means. The strengthened WTO dispute settlement mechanism only plays a marginal effect on countries’ patent protection over time. The <b>bilateral</b> <b>dispute</b> settlement mechanisms represented by the U. S. Trade Representative’s Special 301 placements and other monitoring procedures and bilateral incentives resulting from the BITs between the U. S. and other countries overwhelmed domestic economic, political and legal characteristics in explaining the improvement of patent protection over time. I also show that autocratic regimes are more vulnerable to bilateral pressures asking for improving patent protection.; This thesis contributes to our understanding of patent protection in particular and IPR protection in general. By using various statistical tools, it systematically {{examines the}} effects of domestic economic, political and legal characteristics as well as bilateral and multilateral dispute settlement mechanisms, differentiates the relative importance of various influences, and suggests the possible mechanisms for certain influences...|$|E
40|$|The master thesis aims {{to provide}} a {{comprehensive}} overview of the Slovenia-Croatian territorial dispute in the period 1991 - 2010. Although this dispute has its origin in the SFRY, it fully sprung up {{at the time of}} independence of Slovenia and Croatia, when the question of the definition of a common border appeared. The thesis is primarily focused on three key issues: the definition of the coastal border {{at the mouth of the}} River Dragonja, the delimitation of the territorial sea in the Piran Bay and in particular on the main Slovenian request for a direct access to international waters. In the first part selected terms from the international law of the sea are explained. The second chapter covers the historical development and changes of borders in Istria with an emphasis on the development of the municipality of Piran. The above key issues are analysed in the third chapter, which is attempting to verify the relevance of the arguments of both parties from the perspective of international law. The fourth chapter deals with the <b>bilateral</b> <b>dispute</b> resolution attempts and also briefly outlines the political developments in both countries. The final chapter then examines the role what the European Union, or the European Commission, played...|$|E
40|$|I explore whether {{international}} organizations (IOs) promote peaceful conflict management.

The analyses reveal that institutions do not promote bilateral negotiations between members, indicating that the socialization and trust-building capabilities of IOs are limited. however, institutions foster multilateral talks, demonstrating that IOs broker bargaining with third party diplomatic intervention.

40|$|Modern {{business}} international {{transactions are}} multiparty and complicated. Such contracts are usually composed of several contracts which can contain <b>bilateral</b> <b>dispute</b> resolution arrangements. According {{to the principle}} of parties autonomy dispute arising between two persons bound by an arbitration agreement in connection with a multiparty project will be resolved by arbitration exclusively between these two parties. Other parties cannot participate in the resolution of the dispute through arbitration, even if they have played {{an active role in the}} actual project. Notwithstanding any legitimate interest, they might have the outcome of the dispute; these parties will remain alien both to the arbitration proceedings and an arbitral award. Their interests are not taken into consideration and left unprotected. Arbitration proceedings, unlike litigation, usually do not bear any intervention or joinder of parties, which is explained by the contractual nature of arbitration. Thus, the binding power of an arbitral award extends only over parties of an arbitration agreement. Meanwhile, an arbitral award can affect interests of third parties. How can these parties defend their interests in arbitration proceedings and during recognition and enforcement proceedings in national courts? There are two ways of resolving such problem in state court litigation. The first one is the compulsory participation of any third party with any legitimate interest in litigation through intervention, joinder of parties, and consolidation of cases. A court ex officio has to gather all parties that can have any legitimate interest in resolving the dispute. If judgment affects any interest of a party that was not involved in the proceedings judgment should be reversed in appellate court. The second way is also the solution against parallel proceedings. This way is to harmonize the outcome of parallel proceedings by the principle of lis pendens and res judicata. The paper examines the binding and res judicata effects of the arbitral award towards third parties through the Russian and international experience of defending of interests of third parties in international arbitration and litigation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Concerns about {{counterfeiting}} and piracy {{are becoming}} increasingly widespread and have now taken on an international dimension. Higher standards of intellectual property protection are being set multilaterally and through the inclusion of intellectual property provisions in bilateral trade agreements. The EU Strategy for the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights in Third Countries has undertaken to revisit the approach to the intellectual property rights chapter of bilateral agreements, including the clarification and strengthening of the enforcement clauses. This approach should be reconsidered {{in the light of}} ongoing negotiations on bilateral trade agreements with a number of trading partners such as Korea, India, and ASEAN, while negotiations on bilateral trade with Ukraine and Russia are also being considered. If the Lisbon Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) comes into force, the European Parliament will have a significantly enhanced role to play in the negotiation of such agreements, including the power of veto. In scrutinising and giving consent to agreements, it is recommended that the European Parliament takes account of the following: (1) if intellectual property enforcement provisions are to be included in agreements, this must be done on the basis of adequate evidence on the level of counterfeiting and piracy and its effects; (2) intellectual property rights are private rights and the main responsibility for taking measures to protect and enforce intellectual property rights should lie with individual right holders; (3) the European Parliament should consider carefully the need to balance flexibilities in the TRIPS Agreement with the need for additional provisions in bilateral agreements to fight counterfeiting and piracy; (4) agreements that contain provisions on recourse to <b>bilateral</b> <b>dispute</b> settlement mechanisms risk weakening the multilateral dispute settlement system; (5) provisions in agreements that expand the scope of border measures to cover exports as well as goods in transit or transhipment should not be unnecessarily burdensome and should be subject to the availability of judicial review; (6) the European Parliament should encourage the EU to undertake needs assessments in third countries to ensure that adequate and appropriate technical and financial cooperation is made available on mutually agreed terms and conditions in order to assist with the training of police, customs officers, judiciary and other government officials; (7) it would be advantageous to establish a parliamentary forum or an inter-parliamentary observatory to monitor and assess the impact of bilateral agreements in the fight against counterfeiting and piracy...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{international}} transactions {{have become}} extremely complicated, requiring {{the participation of}} several parties for the delivery of large-scale projects. However. multiparty commercial projects are invariably executed through several bilateral contracts providing for <b>bilateral</b> <b>dispute</b> resolution arrangements. Some of the contracts might include a jurisdiction clause, certain others might provide for arbitration, while others may not contain any dispute resolution provisions at all. This practice leads to "jurisdictional fragmentation of the multiparty commercial project" where the several parties of a single business plan will fall {{under the jurisdiction of}} different adjudicatory fora. Thus. a dispute arising between two persons bound by an arbitration agreement in connection with the multiparty project will have to be resolved exclusively by arbitration between these two parties. Other persons cannot take part in the resolution of the dispute, even if they play {{an active role in the}} actual business project. and thus have an interest in the outcome of the dispute. These persons will remain third parties, both to the arbitration agreement and the arbitral award. This study focuses on the role and the interests of the wide group of third parties exhibiting an interest in the dispute pending before a tribunal between two genuine parties. The thesis, in particular, examines whether arbitration agreements can affect persons which are not contractually bound by these agreements. In addition, the thesis explores whether arbitral awards can affect persons that have not participated in the arbitration proceedings The thesis challenges the prevailing contractual approach to the issue of arbitration, focusing exclusively on the contractual characteristics of arbitration ag eements. According to this view, the main question is whether a non-signatory can be contractually bound by an arbitration agreement. The study demonstrates that focusing exclusively on the contractual nature of arbitration agreements obscures the real issue here, which is whether arbitration agreements may have any jurisdictional implications vis-a-vis `third parties'. Accordingly, the thesis takes a jurisdictional approach, and argues that the discussion should be focused on the dispute and on any implications this may have to third parties, rather than on the requirement of consent to arbitration agreements. Regarding the effect of arbitral awards on third parties, the thesis argues for a third-party effect of arbitral awards specially designed for the needs of international arbitration. More specifically, the case is made for the application of an arbitral effect different from that of res judicata, both in terms of quality and intensity, but that is nevertheless conclusive. It is also suggested that the third party effect of an arbitral award should be analogous to the degree of substantive association between the genuine and the false third parties. This is consistent with the basic premise of the whole thesis: the relations between several parties, in terms of jurisdiction and more generally in arbitration procedure, should correspond to the extent of association between those parties, in terms of substantive rights, interests and liability.
