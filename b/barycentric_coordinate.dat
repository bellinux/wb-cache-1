50|$|In geometry, the <b>barycentric</b> <b>{{coordinate}}</b> {{system is}} a coordinate {{system in which the}} location of a point of a simplex (a triangle, tetrahedron, etc.) is specified as the center of mass, or barycenter, of usually unequal masses placed at its vertices.

50|$|<b>Barycentric</b> <b>Coordinate</b> Time (TCB) is a {{coordinate}} time {{having its}} spatial origin at {{the solar system}} barycenter. TCB differs from TT in rate and other mostly periodic terms. Neglecting the periodic terms, {{in the sense of}} an average {{over a long period of}} time the two are related by: TCB - TT = LB * (JD -2443144.5) * 86400 seconds. According to IAU the best estimate of the scale difference LB is 1.55051976772e-08.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, {{in order}} to clarify the {{relationships}} between space-time coordinates, new time scales were introduced, each with a different frame of reference. Terrestrial Time is time at Earth's surface. Geocentric Coordinate Time is a coordinate time scale at Earth's center. <b>Barycentric</b> <b>Coordinate</b> Time is a coordinate time scale {{at the center of}} mass of the solar system, which is called the barycenter.

40|$|We develop spherical <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates.</b> Analogous to classical, planar <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> that {{describe}} {{the positions of}} points in a plane {{with respect to the}} vertices of a given planar polygon, spherical <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> describe the positions of points on a sphere with respect to the vertices of a given spherical polygon. In particular, we introduce spherical mean value coordinates that inherit many good properties of their planar counterparts. Furthermore, we present a construction that gives a simple and intuitive geometric interpretation for classical <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates,</b> like Wachspress coordinates, mean value coordinates, and discrete harmonic coordinates. One of the most interesting consequences is the possibility to construct mean value coordinates for arbitrary polygonal meshes. So far, this was only possible for triangular meshes. Furthermore, spherical <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> can be used for all applications where only planar <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> were available up to now. They include Bézier surfaces, parameterization, free-form deformations, and interpolation of rotations...|$|R

50|$|The {{coordinate}} systems involve a world-time, i.e. a global time coordinate {{that could be}} set up by telemetry. Individual clocks of similar construction will not agree with this standard, because {{they are subject to}} differing gravitational potentials or move at various velocities, so the world-time must be slaved to some ideal clock that is assumed to be very far from the whole self-gravitating system. This time standard is called <b>Barycentric</b> <b>Coordinate</b> Time, or TCB.|$|E

5000|$|In 1976 the IAU {{resolved}} {{that the}} theoretical basis for its current (1952) standard of Ephemeris Time was non-relativistic, and that therefore, beginning in 1984, Ephemeris Time {{would be replaced}} by two relativistic timescales intended to constitute dynamical timescales: Terrestrial Dynamical Time (TDT) and Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB). [...] Difficulties were recognized, which led to these being in turn superseded in the 1990s by time scales Terrestrial Time (TT), Geocentric Coordinate Time GCT(TCG) and <b>Barycentric</b> <b>Coordinate</b> Time BCT(TCB).|$|E
40|$|In recent years, a {{wide range}} of {{generalized}} <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> has been suggested. However, all of them lack control over derivatives. We show how the notion of <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> can be extended to specify derivatives at control points. This is also known as Hermite interpolation. We introduce a method to modify existing <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> to higher order <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> and demonstrate, using higher order mean value coordinates, that our method, although conceptually simple and easy to implement, can be used to give easy and intuitive control at interactive frame rates over local space deformations such as rotations...|$|R
50|$|Once again, {{the problem}} of finding the <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> {{has been reduced to}} {{inverting}} a 3×3 matrix. 3D <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> may be used to decide if a point lies inside a tetrahedral volume, and to interpolate a function within a tetrahedral mesh, in an analogous manner to the 2D procedure. Tetrahedral meshes are often used in finite element analysis because the use of <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> can greatly simplify 3D interpolation.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> are all {{positive}} for {{a point in}} a triangle's interior {{but at least one}} is negative for a point in the exterior, and two of the <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> are zero for a vertex point, the <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> given for the orthocenter show that the orthocenter is in an acute triangle's interior, on the right-angled vertex of a right triangle, and exterior to an obtuse triangle.|$|R
5000|$|The instant {{that the}} {{gravitational}} correction {{started to be}} applied serves as the epoch for <b>Barycentric</b> <b>Coordinate</b> Time (TCB), Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG), and Terrestrial Time (TT), which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system. [...] All three of these time scales were defined to read JD 2443144.5003725 (1 January 1977 00:00:32.184) exactly at that instant. (The offset is to provide continuity with the older Ephemeris Time.) TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT, with the equation TT(TAI) = TAI + 32.184 s.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are four}} purpose-designed {{coordinate}} time scales {{defined by the}} IAU for use in astronomy. <b>Barycentric</b> <b>Coordinate</b> Time (TCB) {{is based on a}} reference frame comoving with the barycenter of the Solar system, and has been defined for use in calculating motion of bodies within the Solar system. However, from the standpoint of Earth-based observers, general time dilation including gravitational time dilation causes <b>Barycentric</b> <b>Coordinate</b> Time, which is based on the SI second, to appear when observed from the Earth to have time units that pass more quickly than SI seconds measured by an Earth-based clock, with a rate of divergence of about 0.5 seconds per year. Accordingly, for many practical astronomical purposes, a scaled modification of TCB has been defined, called for historical reasons Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB), with a time unit that evaluates to SI seconds when observed from the Earth's surface, thus assuring that at least for several millennia TDB will remain within 2 milliseconds of Terrestrial Time (TT), albeit that the time unit of TDB, if measured by the hypothetical observer described above, at rest in the reference frame and at infinite distance, would be very slightly slower than the SI second (by 1 part in 1/LB = 1 part in 108/1.550519768).|$|E
5000|$|Tempo is a {{relatively}} old program, and is being replaced by Tempo2. [...] The main advantages of Tempo2, from the abstract, are:We have developed tempo2, a new pulsar timing package that contains propagation and other relevant effects implemented at the 1ns level of precision (a factor of ~100 more precise than previously obtainable). In contrast with earlier timing packages, tempo2 is compliant with the general relativistic framework of the IAU 1991 and 2000 resolutions and hence uses the International Celestial Reference System, <b>Barycentric</b> <b>Coordinate</b> Time and up-to-date precession, nutation and polar motion models.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide an {{extension}} of <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> from simplices to arbitrary convex sets. <b>Barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> over convex 2 D polygons have found numerous applications in various fields as it allows smooth interpolation of data located on vertices. However, no explicit formulation valid for arbitrary convex polytopes has been proposed to extend this interpolation in higher dimensions. Moreover, {{there has been no}} attempt to extend these functions into the continuous domain, where <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> are related to Green’s functions and construct functions that satisfy a boundary value problem. First, we review the properties and construction of <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> in discrete domain for convex polytopes. Next, we show how these concepts extend into the continuous domain to yield <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> for continuous functions. We then provide a proof that our functions satisfy all the desirable properties of <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> in arbitrary dimensions. Finally, we provide an example of constructing such barycentric functions over regions bounded by parametric curves and show how they can be used to perform freeform deformations...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Barycentric</b> <b>coordinates,</b> {{as defined}} above, are {{a form of}} {{homogeneous}} coordinates: indeed, the [...] "usual" [...] homogeneous <b>coordinates</b> are the <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> defined in the extended affine n-space on the simplex whose vertices are the points at infinity on the coordinate axes, plus the origin. Sometimes values of coordinates are restricted with a condition which makes them unique; then, they are affine coordinates. The classical terminology {{in this case is}} that of absolute <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the close correspondence between <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> and <b>barycentric</b> kernels {{from the point}} of view of the limit process when finer and finer polygons converge to a smooth convex domain. We show that any barycentric kernel is the limit of a set of <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> and prove that the convergence rate is quadratic. Our convergence analysis extends naturally to barycentric interpolants and mappings induced by <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> and kernels. We verify our theoretical convergence results numerically on several examples...|$|R
50|$|<b>Barycentric</b> <b>Coordinate</b> Time (TCB, {{from the}} French Temps-coordonnée barycentrique) is a {{coordinate}} time standard {{intended to be}} used as the independent variable of time for all calculations pertaining to orbits of planets, asteroids, comets, and interplanetary spacecraft in the Solar system. It is equivalent to the proper time experienced by a clock at rest in a coordinate frame co-moving with the barycenter of the Solar system: that is, a clock that performs exactly the same movements as the Solar system but is outside the system's gravity well. It is therefore not influenced by the gravitational time dilation caused by the Sun {{and the rest of the}} system.|$|E
50|$|Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB, {{from the}} French Temps Dynamique Barycentrique) is a {{relativistic}} coordinate time scale, intended for astronomical {{use as a}} time standard {{to take account of}} time dilation when calculating orbits and astronomical ephemerides of planets, asteroids, comets and interplanetary spacecraft in the Solar System. TDB is now (since 2006) defined as a linear scaling of <b>Barycentric</b> <b>Coordinate</b> Time (TCB). A feature that distinguishes TDB from TCB is that TDB, when observed from the Earth's surface, has a difference from Terrestrial Time (TT) that is about as small as can be practically arranged with consistent definition: the differences are mainly periodic, and overall will remain at less than 2 milliseconds for several millennia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Barycentric</b> <b>Coordinate</b> Time (TCB) is {{the analog}} of TCG, used for {{calculations}} {{relating to the}} solar system beyond Earth orbit. TCG is defined by a different reference frame from TCB, such {{that they are not}} linearly related. Over the long term, TCG ticks more slowly than TCB by about 1.6 × 10−8 (about 0.5 seconds per year). In addition there are periodic variations, as Earth moves within the Solar system. When the Earth is at perihelion in January, TCG ticks even more slowly than it does on average, due to gravitational time dilation from being deeper in the Sun's gravity well and also velocity time dilation from moving faster relative to the Sun. At aphelion in July the opposite holds, with TCG ticking faster than it does on average.|$|E
