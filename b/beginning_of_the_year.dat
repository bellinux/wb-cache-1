The students and their belongings would then move up to their next playroom.|$|E

5|$|At the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> {{the first}} Senate meeting always {{took place at}} the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. Other venues could include the Temple of Fides or the Temple of Concord, or, if the meeting was outside of the formal {{boundary}} of the city, at the Temple of Apollo or (if a war meeting) at the Temple of Bellona. In addition, the Senate operated while under various religious restrictions. For example, before any meeting could begin, a sacrifice to the gods was made, and a search for divine omens (the auspices) was taken. The auspices were taken in order to determine whether that particular Senate meeting held favor with the gods. The Senate was only allowed to meet in a building of religious significance, such as the Curia Hostilia.|$|E
5|$|By 1139, an {{invasion}} of England by Robert and Matilda appeared imminent. Geoffrey and Matilda had secured much of Normandy and, together with Robert, spent the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> mobilising forces for a cross-Channel expedition. Matilda also appealed to the papacy {{at the start of}} the year; her representative, Bishop Ulger, put forward her legal claim to the English throne on the grounds of her hereditary right and the oaths sworn by the barons. Arnulf of Lisieux led Stephen's case, arguing that because Matilda's mother had really been a nun, her claim to the throne was illegitimate. The Pope declined to reverse his earlier support for Stephen, but from Matilda's perspective the case usefully established that Stephen's claim was disputed.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Amway {{purchased}} WHN in New York, giving Mutual {{a second}} major-market owned-and-operated station. On a Country Road, a music show hosted by WHN's Lee Arnold, was introduced and given national distribution. At the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> Mutual had begun airing Mutual Radio Theater, formerly Sears Radio Theater, {{which it had}} just picked up. A number of well-regarded dramas were produced {{as part of the}} anthology series. In 1981, Mutual launched Dick Clark's National Music Survey, a three-hour-long weekly program combining music and interviews. Despite these developments and the fact that its satellite network was now fully on line, Amway was making little if any profit out of Mutual. The network's corporate parent began backing out of the radio business. Mutual Radio Theater, the network's last ever original dramatic series, aired its final show on December 19, 1981. In November 1983, Amway sold off Mutual's WCFL to Statewide Broadcasting. A year later, a deal was struck for the sale of WHN to Doubleday Broadcasting.|$|E

5|$|Sandoval {{made the}} Giants' Opening Day roster out of spring {{training}} in 2009 as the Giants' starting third baseman and backup catcher. He served as a personal catcher for Zito at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> On May 12, Sandoval hit his first walk-off home run against Joe Beimel to beat the Washington Nationals 97. Following an elbow injury to Sandoval in May, the Giants called up Eli Whiteside {{to serve as the}} backup catcher on May 24; since then, Sandoval has not been used at all as a catcher. After 73 games played, San Francisco Chronicle columnist Scott Ostler wrote that Sandoval had made the most impressive transition from the Giants farm system since 1986 when Will Clark and Robby Thompson were rookies.|$|E
5|$|The {{first season}} saw them finish runners-up, but the club's {{management}} declined {{to apply for}} promotion back into the Southern League and so they remained in the Wessex League. In the following three seasons they were placed seventh, ninth and sixth, but 1997–98 saw the club finish runners-up again, winning promotion back to the Southern League. Returning after a five-year absence, {{it was not long}} before the difference in quality between the two leagues became evident, and the club soon realised that it was unable to compete financially with the bigger clubs in the division. At the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> the club announced its intention to return to the Wessex League for 1999–2000, a decision taken because it was felt {{it would be better to}} play in a league in which it could compete financially and successfully.|$|E
5|$|He went {{one better}} at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, where he beat Fernando Meligeni to win the bronze medal, thus {{becoming}} the first Indian to win an individual medal since KD Jadhav won bronze at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics {{more than four decades}} earlier. Paes cited the match as one of his greatest performances on the court, in part because his wrist was severely injured. He was awarded the highest sporting honour by the government of India, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna in 1996. His first successful year in the ATP circuit came in 1993, when he partnered Sébastien Lareau to reach the US Open doubles semifinal. After having a moderate season in 1994, he reached the quarter-finals of the 1995 Australian Open doubles with Kevin Ullyett. From 1996, he partnered with fellow-Indian Mahesh Bhupathi, which would prove to be a winning combination. Their first year was not a very successful one, especially in the Grand Slams, with a round of 32 finish at Wimbledon being the best. 1997 proved to be a much better year for the team of Paes and Bhupathi, with the semifinals of the US Open their best Grand Slam result. Paes climbed the doubles ranking from no. 89 at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> to no. 14 {{at the end of the}} year. That year he also made his best singles performance in a Grand Slam, getting to the third round of the 1997 US Open, beating Carlos Costa and Arnaud Boetsch before losing to Cédric Pioline.|$|E

5|$|The Minister Herald (Dahonglu 大鴻臚) {{was also}} known as the Grand Herald; he was also called the Director of Guests (Dianke 典客) between 202 BC and 144 BC and Prefect Grand Usher (Daxingling 大行令) between 144 BC and 104 BC. He was the chief {{official}} in charge of receiving honored guests, such as nobles and foreign ambassadors, at the imperial court. Alongside the Minister of the Imperial Clan, his ministry oversaw the inheritance of titles and fiefs by condoling on behalf of the emperor at kings' funerals and memorializing the posthumous names of kings and marquises. The Minister Herald's office received the annual reports from the commanderies and kingdoms when they arrived in the capital at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> before passing them on to the Excellencies. His subordinates acted as seating guides and ushers for officials, nobles, and foreign delegates at imperial ceremonies and sacrifices. One of his subordinates maintained living quarters for officials in the commanderies and kingdoms who were traveling to the capital. While the Minister Herald had always conducted the formal reception of foreign envoys and enlisted the aid of interpreters, his powers in matters of foreign affairs were expanded further when the post of Director of Dependent States was abolished in 28 BC. However, by Eastern Han his duties involving the affairs of Dependent States were transferred to local administrations along the borders.|$|E
5|$|Throughout July, the battalion's {{companies}} were detached to support individual Australian brigades during the First Battle of El Alamein as the Allied forces– which had, since the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> been steadily pushed {{back by the}} German and Italian forces– fought desperately to stop the German advance east towards Cairo. Supporting the infantry battalions fighting around Tel el Eisa in early July, several of the battalion's crews played significant roles in turning back attacks on the Australian positions, and in concert with divisional artillery {{were reported to have}} inflicted heavy casualties upon the German and Italian soldiers. Later, {{in the middle of the}} month, they supported an attack by the 2/32nd Infantry Battalion, now commanded by the 2/2nd's old commander, Whitehead, around Makh Khad Ridge to the right of the Qattara Track. By the end of the month the offensive had come to a halt and during the lull that followed the battalion provided defensive fire from depth positions. In October, it joined the second Allied counter-attack that was launched during the Second Battle of El Alamein. During these battles, the battalion was heavily engaged, with a company supporting a composite force under Whitehead, and another operating in support of the 24th Brigade. Its casualties amounted to 21 killed, 128 wounded and 26 captured.|$|E
