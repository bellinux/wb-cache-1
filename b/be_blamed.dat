5|$|The Raiders {{declined}} to allow New York reporters to watch practices, a courtesy Ewbank extended to Oakland pressmen. Raiders assistant coach (later head coach) John Madden {{was responsible for}} the exchange of game films with upcoming opponents; he sent the films to the Jets through Chicago so they would arrive a day or two late, reasoning that Davis, not he, would <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> for the delay. Ewbank blamed Davis for heavily watering the Coliseum field to slow the Jets' speedy receivers, a tactic the Oakland co-owner credited to Madden.|$|E
5|$|The film's soundtrack and {{background}} score were composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics by Vairamuthu. The soundtrack was released through Star Music. Strips of herbal rejuvenator capsules were sold {{along with the}} film's music cassettes. Before the film's release, Rahman asked Ravikumar if the soundtrack could be released in August 1999. Ravikumar informed Rahman that he had already discussed a release date with the press, and that Rahman would <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> for any delay. To make the deadline, Rahman did a live re-recording of both the soundtrack and score to finish them on time.|$|E
5|$|The former Oxford University {{historian}} Adrian Goldsworthy {{has argued}} that the cause of the fall of the Roman Empire in the West should not <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> on barbarization of the late Roman Army, but on its recurrent civil wars, which led to its ability to repel or defeat invasions from outside its frontiers to be seriously weakened. The East Roman or Byzantine empire on the other hand had fewer civil wars to contend with in the late fourth and early fifth centuries, or in the years from 383-432 A.D.|$|E

50|$|The {{government}} and Kuanyin Bol <b>are</b> <b>blamed</b> for {{their role in}} destroying the local agriculture during their attempt to take the city of Wau. The SPLA <b>are</b> <b>blamed</b> for their maintenance of slavery and pilfering of aid.|$|R

5|$|When Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in January 1933, Fuchs {{decided to}} leave Kiel, where the NSDAP was {{particularly}} strong {{and he was a}} well-known KPD member. He enrolled at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin. On 28 February, he took an early train to Berlin for a KPD meeting there. On the train, he read about the Reichstag fire in a newspaper. Fuchs correctly assumed that opposition parties would <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> for the fire, and quietly removed his hammer and sickle lapel pin.|$|E
5|$|With {{strong support}} from Ryzhkov, Gorbachev {{abolished}} the Central Committee economic department, thereby strengthening the authority of central government over economic matters. From then on, the government could not <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> for economic policies initiated by the Party leadership. The establishment of the post of President of the Soviet Union by Gorbachev in 1990 weakened {{the power of the}} government apparatus; a move Ryzhkov and his second cabinet opposed.|$|E
5|$|According to {{an article}} on The Conversation written by Robert Merkel, Heartbleed {{revealed}} a massive failure of risk analysis. Merkel thinks OpenSSL gives more importance to performance than to security, which no longer makes sense in his opinion. But Merkel considers that OpenSSL should not <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> as much as OpenSSL users, who chose to use OpenSSL, without funding better auditing and testing. Merkel explains that two aspects determine the risk that more similar bugs will cause vulnerabilities. One, the library's source code influences the risk of writing bugs with such an impact. Secondly, OpenSSL's processes affect the chances of catching bugs quickly. On the first aspect, Merkel mentions {{the use of the}} C programming language as one risk factor which favored Heartbleed's appearance, echoing Wheeler's analysis.|$|E
25|$|The massive {{famine in}} the early 1930s (which was {{organized}} partly by the state) <b>was</b> <b>blamed</b> on religious believers who supposedly were infiltrating the collective farms and wrecking them from within. They <b>were</b> <b>blamed</b> in similar ways for {{the failures of the}} Soviet economy in the 1930s. Religious festivals <b>were</b> also <b>blamed</b> for hurting the economy by introducing high work absenteeism and drunkenness.|$|R
50|$|Much blame flew {{around about}} {{the reasons for the}} failure. The Government <b>was</b> <b>blamed</b> for {{restrictive}} conditions of the licence; the management <b>was</b> <b>blamed</b> for bad programme scheduling and failing to control escalating costs; shareholders <b>were</b> <b>blamed</b> for having the short-term mentality of property developers. However, the Government blamed the collapse on the unwillingness of the shareholders to inject more capital, after it had spent its entire HK$20 million within one year. Many TV series were brought by TVB and ATV and TVB seldom rebroadcast them.|$|R

5|$|Catherine's {{three sons}} reigned {{in an age}} of almost {{constant}} civil and religious war in France. The problems facing the monarchy were complex and daunting but Catherine was able to keep the monarchy and the state institutions functioning even at a minimum level. At first, Catherine compromised and made concessions to the rebelling Protestants, or Huguenots, as they became known. She failed, however, to grasp the theological issues that drove their movement. Later she resorted, in frustration and anger, to hard-line policies against them. In return, she came to <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> for the excessive persecutions carried out under her sons' rule, in particular for the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572, in which thousands of Huguenots were killed in Paris and throughout France.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse was {{initially}} lauded for bringing professional football to the Tampa Bay area, but eventually came to <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> for the team's struggles. His {{refusal to pay}} Doug Williams at a salary level {{comparable to that of}} the league's top quarterbacks insulted fans, and was seen as the beginning of the team's decline during the 1980s. It further led to the belief that Culverhouse was unconcerned with fielding a winning team, {{as long as it was}} financially profitable. The Buccaneers' NFL-record streak of fourteen consecutive losing seasons cemented this perception, although Culverhouse did make several notable attempts to improve the team.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{news media}} and {{government}} officials soon began to discuss the apparent substandard construction styles that had caused so many of Armenia's buildings to collapse. Gorbachev, in a TV interview several weeks after his expedited return from New York City, said that the concrete blocks had been built with more than enough sand but too little concrete, and suggested that the concrete had been stolen. , deputy chairman of the state building committee, stated that many newer homes collapsed as well {{and that he was}} beginning an investigation into the matter and that criminal charges would be brought. The official communist party newspaper Pravda said that poor construction, like other issues of neglect in the Soviet system, could <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> on the Era of Stagnation from the era of Leonid Brezhnev.|$|E

We should <b>be</b> <b>blaming</b> the person who produced the newsâ€”the one who burned the Koran." ...|$|R
5|$|Egyptian texts take {{different}} views {{on whether the}} gods are responsible when humans suffer unjustly. Misfortune was often seen {{as a product of}} isfet, the cosmic disorder that was the opposite of maat, and therefore the gods were not guilty of causing evil events. Some deities who were closely connected with isfet, such as Set, could <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> for disorder within the world without placing guilt on the other gods. But some writings do accuse the deities of causing human misery, while others give theodicies in the gods' defense. Beginning in the Middle Kingdom, several texts connected the issue of evil in the world with a myth in which the creator god fights a human rebellion against his rule and then withdraws from the earth. Because of this human misbehavior, the creator is distant from his creation, allowing suffering to exist. New Kingdom writings do not question the just nature of the gods as strongly as those of the Middle Kingdom. They emphasize humans' direct, personal relationships with deities and the gods' power to intervene in human events. People in this era put faith in specific gods who they hoped would help and protect them through their lives. As a result, upholding the ideals of maat grew less important than gaining the gods' favor as a way to guarantee a good life. Even the pharaohs were regarded as dependent on divine aid, and after the New Kingdom came to an end, government was increasingly influenced by oracles communicating the gods' will.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} on 27 May had changed considerably from just 24 hours earlier. The Belgian Army {{had been forced}} from the Leie line on 26 May, and Nevele, Vynckt, Tielt and Iseghem had fallen on the western and {{central part of the}} Leie front. In the east, the Germans had reached the outskirts of Bruges, and captured Ursel. In the west, the Menenâ€“Ypres line had broken at Kortrijk and the Belgians were now using railway trucks to help form anti-tank defences on a line from Ypresâ€“Passchendaeleâ€“Roulers. Further to the west the BEF had been forced back, north of Lille just over the French border and was now in danger of allowing a gap to develop between themselves and the Belgian southern flank on the Ypresâ€“Lille axis. The danger in allowing a German advance to Dunkirk would mean the loss of the port which was now too great. The British withdrew to the port on 26 May. In doing so, they left the French 1st Army's north-eastern flank near Lille exposed. As the British moved out, the Germans moved in, encircling the bulk of the French Army. Both Gort and his Chief of Staff, General Henry Pownall, accepted that their withdrawal would mean the destruction of the French 1st Army, and they would <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> for it.|$|E
25|$|Brigadier Pat MacLellan: Operational {{commander}} of the day. Cleared of any wrongdoing as he {{was under the impression}} that Wilford would follow orders by arresting rioters and then returning to base, and could not <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> for Wilford's actions.|$|E
40|$|Extract] Over {{the past}} 30 years, {{we have seen}} 'moral panics' over {{literacy}} education fuelled by the media in the British, Australian, Canadian, and American press (Barron, 2000). 'Moral panics' as a rhetorical strategy promote deficit thinking and construct literacy crises that require expedient political solutions. Too often children <b>are</b> <b>blamed</b> for poor attention, disruptive behavior or disinterest; parents <b>are</b> <b>blamed</b> for disorderly family routines and turmoil in the home; teachers <b>are</b> <b>blamed</b> for failing to teach traditional values and get their students to perform; and teacher educators <b>are</b> <b>blamed</b> for failing to impart the necessary knowledge to reach children who lack mainstream social values and literacy practices. As long-time researchers of literacy, {{we know it is}} no easy matter to disrupt discourses of blame that attend literacy failure and underachievement...|$|R

25|$|The Western Federation of Miners (or {{at least}} its members) {{routinely}} intimidated strike breakers, and also had resorted to violence, such as blowing up an Idaho mill in 1899.

25|$|Constans II had {{inherited}} from his grandfather Heraclius {{the war with}} the Arabs, who were bent on conquering the Byzantine Empire and spreading {{the word of the}} Islamic Prophet Muhammad.

However, in Randi's opinion it was not funding but the experimenters that were the problem. With $500,000 from McDonnell, Randi felt that lack of funding could no longer <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> for any failure. Randi's purpose was to show that no matter how much money was spent, there would still be no reliable results.|$|E
