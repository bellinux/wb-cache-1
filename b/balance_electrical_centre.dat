It is a {{mechanism}} for interchange of power between two and more utilities which provide or generate electricity For exchange of power between two utilities there is an interchange agreement which is signed by them, but signing up an interchange agreement between each pair of utilities within a system can be a difficult task where several large utilities are interconnected. Thus, it is more advantageous to form a power pool with a single agreement that all join. That agreement provides established terms and conditions for pool members and is generally more complex than a bilateral agreement.|$|R

The aim, at these universities and laboratories, is to achieve an accelerating gradient in excess of 50 MV/m in 9 -cell superconducting cavities whilst maintaining a high quality and stable electron beam. At these gradients, electrical breakdown is an important cause for concern and the wakefields excited by the energetic electron beams are also potentially damaging to the beam's emittance.

40|$|In a {{freehand}} 3 D ultrasound system, a {{probe calibration}} {{is required to}} find the rigid body transformation {{from the corner of}} the B-scan to the <b>electrical</b> <b>centre</b> of the position sensor. The most intuitive way to perform such a calibration is by locating fiducial points in the scan plane directly with a stylus. The main problem of using this approach is the difficulty in aligning the tip of the stylus with the scan plane. The thick beam width makes the tip of the stylus visible in the B-scan even if the tip is not exactly in the elevational centre of the scan plane. In this paper, we present two novel phantoms that simplify the alignment process for more accurate probe calibration. We also compare our calibration techniques with a range of styli and show that our phantom outperforms other approaches in both accuracy and simplicity. ...|$|R

A physiological investigation of cochlear electrical stimulation was undertaken in six two-month-old kittens.

Four ears received implants for same period but without electrical stimulation. The other two ears served as normal control. The results indicated: 1) Chronic electrical stimulation of the cochlea within electrochemically safe limits did not influence the hearing of kittens and the normal delivery of impulses evoked by acoustic and electrical signals on the auditory brainstem pathway. 2) The wave shapes of EABRs {{were similar to those}} of ABRs. The aptitudes of EABRs showed a significant increase following chronic electrical stimulation, resulting in a leftward shift in the input/ output function. The absolute latencies and interwave latencies of waves II-III, III -IV and II -IV were significantly shorter than those of ABRs. These results imply that there was no adverse effect of chronic electrical stimulation on the maturing auditory systems of kittens using these electrical parameters and the mechanism of electrical hearing should be further studied.

During {{the course}} of a chronic intracochlear electrical stimulation study using charge balanced biphasic current pulses, one animal inadvertently received a short period of direct current (DC) stimulation at a level of approximately 1 µA. Subsequent, the animal was chronically stimulated using a poorly charge balanced waveform that produced a DC level of approximately 2 µA. Extensive pathological changes were observed within the cochlea. These changes included widespread spiral ganglion cell loss and new bone growth that extended throughout all turns of the cochlea. Significant changes in the morphology of the electrically evoked auditory brainstem response (EABR) were associated with these pathological changes. EABRs recorded prior to the DC stimulation exhibited a normal waveform morphology. However, responses recorded during {{the course of}} the DC stimulation were dominated by a short latency response believed to be vestibular in origin. The response thresholds were also significantly higher than levels recorded before the DC stimulation. In contrast, the contralateral cochlea, stimulated using charge balanced stimuli, showed no evidence of adverse pathological changes. Furthermore, EABRs evoked from this cochlea remained stable throughout the chronic stimulation period. Although preliminary, the present results illustrate the adverse nature of poorly charge <b>balanced</b> <b>electrical</b> stimuli. These results have important implications for both the design of neural prostheses and the use of DC stimuli to suppress tinnitus in patients.
