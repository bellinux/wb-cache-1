5|$|Although {{this bird}} eats rice on the {{wintering}} grounds, {{where it can}} make up nearly 40% of its diet, it takes mainly waste and residues from cropping and threshing, not harvestable grain. It has sometimes <b>been</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a pest, but the deeper water and presence of invertebrate prey in the economically important early winter period means that the wader has little effect on crop yield.|$|E

5|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century, The Fairchild Family was {{renowned for its}} {{realistic}} portrayal of childhood and its humor, but Sherwood's book fell from favor as Britain became increasingly secularized and new fashions in children's literature came to dominate the literary scene, represented by works such as Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. In the twentieth century the books have most often <b>been</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> quintessential examples of the didactic style of children's writing popular before Alice.|$|E
5|$|Wong's {{image and}} career {{have left a}} notable legacy. Through her films, public {{appearances}} and prominent magazine features, she helped to humanize Asian Americans to white audiences {{during a period of}} overt racism and discrimination. Asian Americans, especially the Chinese, had <b>been</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> perpetually foreign in U.S. society but Wong's films and public image established her as an Asian-American citizen at a time when laws discriminated against Asian immigration and citizenship. Wong's hybrid image dispelled contemporary notions that the East and West were inherently different.|$|E
5|$|A {{critical}} and commercial success in 1990, Fear of a Black Planet sold two {{million copies in}} the United States and received rave reviews from critics, many of whom named {{it one of the}} year's best albums. Its immediate success contributed significantly to the popularity of Afrocentric and political subject matter in hip hop and the genre's mainstream resurgence at the time. Since then, it has <b>been</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> one of hip hop's greatest and most important records, as well as being musically and culturally significant. In 2003, Fear of a Black Planet was ranked number 300 on Rolling Stones list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and in 2005, the Library of Congress added it to the National Recording Registry.|$|E

5|$|Alive or Just Breathing is {{the second}} studio album by American metalcore band Killswitch Engage. It was {{released}} on May 21, 2002, through Roadrunner Records. Alive or Just Breathing was Killswitch Engage's first album on Roadrunner and was recorded from October 2001 to February 2002. Produced by drummer and guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz, this was the band's first album on a major label, which prompted them to write and record the album {{to the best of}} their abilities. Alive or Just Breathing has <b>been</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a landmark album in the metalcore genre and was well praised upon its release by fans and critics.

5|$|Eardwulf (fl. 790– c. 830) {{was king}} of Northumbria from 796 to 806, {{when he was}} deposed and went into exile. He {{may have had a}} second reign from 808 until perhaps 811 or 830. Northumbria {{in the last years of}} the eighth century was the scene of dynastic strife between several noble families: in 790, the then-king Æthelred I {{attempted}} to have Eardwulf assassinated. Eardwulf's survival may have <b>been</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a sign of divine favour. A group of nobles conspired to assassinate Æthelred in April 796 and he was succeeded by Osbald: Osbald's reign lasted only twenty-seven days before he was deposed and Eardwulf became king on 14 May 796.|$|E

She threw her hands up in shock, but was not injured. Later, while sitting with the Foreign Minister, protesters threw tomatoes at her. The tomatoes hit the Foreign Minister and splattered on Eva's dress. After these two events, Eva had had enough, and after two months returned to Argentina.|$|E

5|$|Fearing the {{approaching}} Jin army, Song emperor Huizong planned to retreat south. The emperor deserting the capital would have <b>been</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> {{an act of}} capitulation, so court officials convinced him to abdicate. There were few objections. Rescuing an empire in crisis from destruction {{was more important than}} preserving the rituals of imperial inheritance. In January 1126, {{a few days before the}} New Year, Huizong abdicated in favor of his son and was demoted to the ceremonial role of Retired Emperor. The Jurchen forces reached the Yellow River on January 27, 1126, two days after the New Year. Huizong fled Kaifeng the next day, escaping south and leaving the newly enthroned emperor Qinzong (r. 1126–1127) in charge of the capital.|$|E
5|$|Incinerating waste has {{traditionally}} <b>been</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a method {{with the main}} purpose being {{the destruction of the}} waste involved. Recovering the energy generated from this process has become of greater importance, and all incineration facilities in England now operate as energy-from-waste plants (with many operating as combined heat and power facilities). Critics question the safety of the pollutants emitted during the process and argue that, as incinerators require constant levels of waste to operate, it encourages more waste. However, the levels of emissions from the incinerating process has been greatly reduced by developments in technology and legislation.|$|E
5|$|The {{functions}} of the frills and three distinctive facial horns on its head have long inspired debate. Traditionally, these have <b>been</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> defensive weapons against predators. More recent theories, noting the presence of {{blood vessels in the}} skull bones of ceratopsids, find it more probable that these features were primarily used in identification, courtship and dominance displays, much like the antlers and horns of modern reindeer, mountain goats, or rhinoceros beetles. The theory would find additional support if Torosaurus was found to be the mature form of Triceratops, as this would mean the frill also developed holes (fenestrae) as individuals reached maturity, rendering the structure more useful for display than defense.|$|E

5|$|The song {{selection}} {{caused some}} controversy, since it underplayed Harrison's solo achievements during the 1970–75 period, {{for much of}} which he had <b>been</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> the most successful ex-Beatle, artistically and commercially. Music critics have also noted the compilation's failure to provide a faithful picture of Harrison's contribution to the Beatles' work, due to the omission of any of his Indian music compositions. In a calculated move by EMI and its American subsidiary, Capitol Records, the compilation was issued during the same month as Harrison's debut on his Warner-distributed Dark Horse label, Thirty Three & 1/3.|$|E
5|$|TouchWave, Inc. (now WebCom), was {{a privately}} held Palo Alto, California IP-telephony network switch {{provider}} founded in 1997. TouchWave developed a product line called WebSwitch {{that was designed}} to replace traditional private telephone exchange systems in small-to-medium-sized companies. WebSwitch was part of a phone system that incorporates communication features provided by the Internet. The rapid success of TouchWave was memorialized with awards and an acquisition by Ericsson Communications for $46M two years after TouchWave was founded. Ericsson continued the TouchWave product line under the name WebCom, but its efforts have <b>been</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> less than successful.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann's {{results have}} <b>been</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> {{a special case}} of linear programming, where von Neumann's model uses only nonnegative matrices.

5|$|As {{his sons}} had desired and planned, Wilberforce has long <b>been</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a Christian hero, a statesman-saint {{held up as}} a role model for putting his faith into action. More broadly, he has also been {{described}} as a humanitarian reformer who contributed significantly to reshaping the political and social attitudes of the time by promoting concepts of social responsibility and action. In the 1940s, the role of Wilberforce and the Clapham Sect in abolition was downplayed by historian Eric Williams, who argued that abolition was motivated not by humanitarianism but by economics, as the West Indian sugar industry was in decline. Williams' approach strongly influenced historians for much of {{the latter part of the}} 20th century. However, more recent historians have noted that the sugar industry was still making large profits at the time of abolition, and this has led to a renewed interest in Wilberforce and the Evangelicals, as well as a recognition of the anti-slavery movement as a prototype for subsequent humanitarian campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Carey has {{expressed}} her belief in God and her connection between music and spirituality, {{and felt the}} album was finally a way to portray her mysticism into music. After the success of Carey's previous effort, Music Box, there was speculation of a new project in the works; however {{it was not until}} October 1994, only one month before the album's release, that Billboard announced Carey would be releasing a holiday album for the Christmas season. Initially, critics were shocked; they did not know how Carey would fare as an entertainer, as she had previously only <b>been</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a pop star. Nevertheless, Carey, unaffected by the speculation, continued working on, and promoting the album in high spirits, confident in her work. The idea proved to be wise, earning Carey recognition in various markets including Christian radio and contemporary R stations, as well as extended her fame in Japan, where the album experienced much of its success.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{the founders}} were {{educated in the}} {{classical}} tradition, and used classical models for landmarks and buildings in Washington, D.C., to avoid the feudal and religious connotations of European architecture such as castles and cathedrals. In forming their theory of the mixed constitution, the founders looked to Athenian democracy and Roman republicanism for models, but regarded the Roman emperor as a figure of tyranny. They nonetheless adopted Roman Imperial forms such as the dome, as represented by the US Capitol and numerous state capitol buildings, to express classical ideals through architecture. Thomas Jefferson saw the Empire as a negative political lesson, but was a chief proponent of its architectural models. Jefferson's design for the Virginia State Capitol, for instance, is modelled directly from the Maison Carrée, a Gallo-Roman temple built under Augustus. The renovations of the National Mall {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century have <b>been</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> expressing a more overt imperialist kinship with Rome.|$|E
