40|$|Arthritis {{is marked}} with joint {{deterioration}} that affects articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Though cartilage degradation {{is a major}} damage during arthritis, the subsequent bone loss cannot be neglected. Progress in the arthritis research has identified clinical importance of bone erosion in destructive arthritis. Studies have showed the key role played by osteoclasts and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL) signaling in bone erosion. Cathepsins and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) are considered key enzymatic factors contributing to bone erosion. Further, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formed at the ruffled border of osteoclasts also causes bone resorption and matrix degradation. Besides, severe inflammation during arthritis induces bone erosion by aiding in Ca 2 + removal and activating osteoclastogenesis. The inflammatory cytokines and ROS influence osteoclast differentiation by regulating osteoclast-lineage cells or by acting on other cells to regulate the expression of RANKL and osteoprotegerin (OPG). The enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ROS in arthritis will stimulate tissue injury by means of oxidative damage leading to vital organ damage and synovial and circulatory cell apoptosis. Thus, blocking enzymatic and non-enzymatic factors responsible for <b>bone</b> erosion and <b>inflammation</b> is considered a prime target {{in the management of}} arthritis. In this review we provide an overview of the mechanisms of <b>bone</b> erosion, <b>inflammation</b> and associated oxidative stress/damage during arthritis perpetuation along with shedding light on potential targets. The article also describes the possible therapeutic agents that could prevent <b>bone</b> loss and <b>inflammation,</b> and related secondary complications of arthritis...|$|R
50|$|The {{lacrimal}} glands are paired, almond-shaped exocrine glands, one {{for each}} eye, that secrete the aqueous layer of the tear film. They are situated in the upper lateral region of each orbit, in the lacrimal fossa of the orbit formed by the frontal <b>bone.</b> <b>Inflammation</b> of the lacrimal glands is called dacryoadenitis. The lacrimal gland produces tears which then flow into canals that connect to the lacrimal sac. From that sac, the tears drain through the lacrimal duct into the nose.|$|E
50|$|There {{are other}} causes {{of pain in}} the {{forefoot}}. Too often all forefoot pain is categorized as neuroma. Other conditions to consider are capsulitis, which is an inflammation of ligaments that surrounds two bones, {{at the level of}} the joint. In this case, it would be the ligaments that attach the phalanx (bone of the toe) to the metatarsal <b>bone.</b> <b>Inflammation</b> from this condition will put pressure on an otherwise healthy nerve and give neuroma-type symptoms. Additionally, an intermetatarsal bursitis between the third and fourth metatarsal bones will also give neuroma-type symptoms because it too puts pressure on the nerve. Freiberg's disease, which is an osteochondritis of the metatarsal head, causes pain on weight bearing or compression.|$|E

50|$|The {{effects of}} SH3BP2 {{mutations}} {{are still under}} study, but researchers believe that the abnormal protein disrupts critical signaling pathways in cells associated with the maintenance of bone tissue and in some immune system cells. The overactive protein likely causes inflammation in the jaw bones and triggers the production of osteoclasts, which are cells that break down bone tissue during bone remodeling. Osteoclasts also sense the increased inflammation of the mandible and maxilla and are further activated to break down bone structures. <b>Bone</b> loss and <b>inflammation</b> lead to increased fibrous tissue and cyst growth. An excess of these bone-eating cells contributes {{to the destruction of}} bone in the upper and lower jaws. A combination of <b>bone</b> loss and <b>inflammation</b> likely underlies the cyst-like growths characteristic of Cherubism.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This study {{aimed to}} {{examine the effect of}} chronic {{restraint}} stress (RS) on the severity of experimental periodontal disease in rats. A total of 32 male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were divided into four groups: i) Rats receiving two treatment regimens, chronic stress induced by movement restriction in acrylic cylinders for 1 - 1. 5 h daily and induction of experimental periodontal disease, using a nylon ligature which was placed around the first left mandibular molars (n= 8); ii) induction of periodontal disease, without RS (n= 8); iii) RS (n= 8) and iv) control (n= 8). After 15 days, blood samples were obtained, and blood glucose levels and the corticosterone concentration were measured as stress markers. The severity of periodontal disease was analyzed according to the level of gingival and <b>bone</b> <b>inflammation,</b> leading to compromise of the teeth involved. Chronic stress was induced with movement restriction (P≤ 0. 05, Mann-Whitney U-test) and increased the severity (P≤ 0. 05, Mann-Whitney U-test) of experimental perio dontal disease in rats, according to the level of gingival and <b>bone</b> <b>inflammation</b> around the first left mandibular molars.

30|$|The AT here {{described}} induced {{total body}} and truncal fat mass decreases and body lean mass increases in MS women. Changes in total body and truncal fat are likely {{connected with the}} decreased cytokine concentrations, considering hypertrophied adipocytes {{are responsible for the}} cytokine release on obesity [5]. In this regard, the adipose tissue is considered not only such a fat depot but also an endocrine tissue linked to appetite modulation, insulin sensitivity, endocrine and reproductive systems, <b>bone</b> metabolism, <b>inflammation,</b> and immunity [26]. In fact, AT increases energy expenditure and conducts lipolysis of both subcutaneous and intramuscular fat stores [27] accumulated in individuals who ingest more energy than they need [28], such is the case of MS patients.|$|R
25|$|Other {{compressive}} spinal causes include lumbar spinal stenosis, {{a condition}} in which the spinal canal (the spaces the spinal cord runs through) narrows and compresses the spinal cord, cauda equina, or sciatic nerve roots. This narrowing can be caused by <b>bone</b> spurs, spondylolisthesis, <b>inflammation,</b> or a herniated disc, which decreases available space for the spinal cord, thus pinching and irritating nerves from the spinal cord that travel to the sciatic nerves.|$|R
50|$|These terms {{can also}} be used to refer to the {{clinical}} sense of the words, as relative crown and relative root, by describing how much tooth remains surrounded by <b>bone.</b> As the <b>inflammation</b> associated with periodontal disease causes the bone to resorb and disappear, revealing more of the root structure, the effective crown height in relation to the effective root height is reduced and the prognosis shifts from favorable to unfavorable.|$|R
30|$|Taken together, {{observations}} in IL- 10 -deficient animals and CRMO patients {{support the hypothesis}} that imbalanced expression of anti-inflammatory (IL- 10, IL- 19) and pro-inflammatory (IL- 1 β, IL- 6, TNFα, IL- 20) cytokines result in <b>bone</b> <b>inflammation</b> [6, 22]. Data from metabolic studies indicate that imbalanced expression of anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines contribute to enhanced interactions between the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK) surface receptor and its soluble ligand RANKL on osteoclast precursor cells (Fig.  1) [13, 25, 26]. Interactions between RANK and RANKL result in osteoclast differentiation and activation and may therefore contribute to inflammatory bone loss in CNO. However, the involvement of these molecular events in CNO remains to be scientifically proven.|$|E
30|$|The {{question}} of how imbalanced cytokine expression may translate into the <b>bone</b> <b>inflammation</b> and the expression of CRMO remained unanswered. Recently, NLRP 3 inflammasome activation was linked to inflammatory bone loss and synovial inflammation in IL- 10 -deficient mice [23]. Two studies demonstrated increased NLRP 3 and IL- 1 mRNA expression in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCS) [24] and monocytes [22] of CRMO patients. We linked impaired IL- 10 and IL- 19 expression with subsequently increased IL- 1 β mRNA expression and IL- 1 β proteins in monocytes from CRMO patients [22]. Indeed, enhanced inflammasome activation and IL- 1 β secretion from monocytes was reversed by co-culture with recombinant IL- 10 or IL- 19 [22].|$|E
